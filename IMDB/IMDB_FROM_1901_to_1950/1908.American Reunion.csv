0,Leofwine_draca,Surprisingly sweet,6,5 April 2014,"Although I hate the lowbrow comedy genre ever since its inception in the late 1990s with the likes of THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY and THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME, for some reason I consider myself a fan of the American PIE franchise. This is the fourth in the series which takes the expected route of catching up with the characters as they deal with adulthood.The story is surprisingly sweet and sentimental if you take out all of the puerile humour. Crucially, for fans of the series, the producers have managed to pretty much reunite the entire cast, including Chris Klein, who was missing from the last instalment as I recall. So watching these characters mingling again after all these years is a great deal of fun, and the camaraderie and humour that flows between them is pretty decent.Yes, there are some obnoxious jokes here, and situations that scream facile; typically those involving Stifler. Nonetheless, Seann William Scott is undeniably charming in this part, and I notice that his character has deliberately softened a little, less jarring, more humane this time. The same goes with the others and I think that's why I like this series so much: despite the gross-outs, these films are all about warmth and friendship. American REUNION is a lot of fun.",American Reunion
1,SnoopyStyle,The Gang is Back,8,11 September 2013,"This is the fourth installment of the American Pie series. The gang is back and that's half the battle. Almost everybody makes a cameo; the MILF guys, Stiffler's mom, Shermanator, and even Nadia. Jim and Michelle are knee deep in childcare, and their love-life is in a rut. Jim's mom has passed, and Jim's dad has trouble dealing with it. Oz is a big time sports TV commentator, and has a flirtatious girlfriend he doesn't trust. Kevin has become the Mrs of his home. Finch is mysterious with wild tall tales. Stifler is stuck in a lousy job living at home making all the effort to recreate his wild high school ways.The gang's chemistry is back. It's great to see all the kids grow up and not grow up. The best part is the film's ability to incorporate all the franchise's history. And Jason Biggs shows the bits, somewhat squished.",American Reunion
2,kosmasp,It was worth the wait,8,15 July 2012,"The in-between movies didn't really do anything for any American Pie fan (talking about everything that was tagged with the American Pie title after the American Wedding aka Part 3), but this one will satisfy the fans of the original. Even though (or because) they have grown up, many will remember them. While I think it works for newer viewers (without previous knowledge of the original trilogy), I think the full viewing potential/pleasure will only emerge if you have seen the others too.While I was a bit skeptical about the fact that Stifler (played exceptionally again by Sean William Scott), went ""back"" attitude wise in this one, it made more than sense and doesn't take anything away from his arc in Part 3. I would even say, his journey is fulfilled now for sure! The others have their problems too (even if some seem small in comparison to others) and they play it as straight as the first time. Many familiar faces will show up, even the ones who didn't have an actual character name in part 1. A nice touch.The movie may be (largely) predictable, but apart from some major surprise towards the end, it is done with love by everyone involved and you can feel that through the screen. A really fitting end (?) to a series, that defined a generation of movie-goers",American Reunion
3,jboothmillard,American Pie: Reunion,5,11 May 2012,"It has been eleven years since the entire cast of the original film were last together, and nine years since the third official cinema film, followed by four straight to DVD spin-offs, so it was good to bring everyone again. Basically Jim Levenstein (Jason Biggs) and Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) are still married, but two year old son Evan (George Christopher Bianchi) around means their love making has dwindled, Chris 'Oz' Ostreicher (Chris Klein) is in Los Angeles with supermodel girlfriend Mia (Katrina Bowden) and is an NFL sportscaster, Kevin Myers (Thomas Ian Nicholas) has a beard and is an architect at home, married to Ellie (Charlene Amoia), Steve 'Stifmeister' Stifler (Seann William Scott) works at an investment firm, and Paul Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) just turns up. John - 'MILF' Guy #2 (John Cho) has organised a Class of 1999 High School Reunion party in East Great Falls, and soon enough the five friends are brought back together to relive old times. Returning home Jim's Dad, Noah (Eugene Levy) is a widower as his wife (Molly Cheek) died, and Jim recognises neighbour Kara (Ali Cobrin) who he used to babysit for, she is going to be eighteen very soon, and also at the bar the boys recognise former classmate and band camp member Selena (Dania Ramirez). With the boys reunited they go the beach, Oz reunites with former girlfriend Heather (Mena Suvari), who is dating heart surgeon Ron (Jay Harrington), and Kevin reconnects with former girlfriend Victoria 'Vicky' Lathum (Tara Reid). There is a confrontation with Kara's boyfriend AJ (Chuck Hittinger) and his friends, and Stifler gets revenge by defecating their beer cooler and destroys their jet skis. Night time and the boys stumble on a high school party, which turns out to be Kara's eighteenth birthday party, and when she gets intoxicated Jim drives her home, and being a virgin she tries to seduce him. Oz, Finch and Stifler come along to help him get drunk Kara back into her house without her parents, Mom (Kim Wall) and Dad (Stevie Ray Dallimore), noticing, and they distract them long enough to do it. Kevin wakes up the next day in Vicky's bed, he assumes they had sex, and later on Stifler arranges a high school party like he used, but being older all the guests have grown out of their old habits. Jim and Michelle attend the party hoping to reenact prom night, where they first had sex, and Jim's Dad is attending as well to get out and try to get over his grief depression, and he connects with Stifler's Mom (Jennifer Coolidge). Kevin offends Vicky when he assumes that they did have sex, Mia takes ecstasy and acts foolish while Oz has Ron humiliate him with the DVD of the dance show, Celebrity Dance-Off, and when Heather comforts her ex-boyfriend they reconnect and kiss, and she ends up in a fight with Mia. Jim and Michelle decide to dress and up and have role play sex, but Kara once again tries to seduce him, and AJ shows up to get his own back on the guys for the earlier incidents, this turns into a huge fight, ending with the police calming it down, and Finch arrested for the theft of a motorcycle. Mia breaks up with Oz, Stifler feels down and skips the reunion for work, and Michelle goes to her grandmother's while Jim and his Dad connect and talk about relationship stuff. The reunion party begins, Finch comes back having been bailed, and confesses his stories of travels are false, he is in fact working at Staples and stole the motorcycle after not getting a raise, but Stifler is missing, so all the boys go to get him. After some assuring words from his friends, Stifler finds the courage to stand up to his boss and quit his job, and they all go to the reunion, where old friends turn up, like Jessica (Natasha Lyonne) who is a lesbian, Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth) who has a new boyfriend, and Chuck 'Shermanator' Sherman (Chris Owen) who is still geeky and looking for love. Vicky and Kevin make up having established they didn't have sex, Finch is happy with Selena and can forget about Stifler's Mom, Heather dumps Ron and gets back together with Oz, and Jim and Michelle finally find the time to have good passionate sex together. At the party Stifler is asked by two former lacrosse players who are gay if he can plan their wedding, which he agrees, and he also gets to meet Finch's mother Rachel (The Hand That Rocks the Cradle's Rebecca De Mornay), and they have sex together on the field, with John and Justin - 'MILF' Guy #1 (Justin Isfeld) reunited and chanting their catchphrase. The next morning the boys gather at Dog Years, Kara apologises to Jim and agrees she will find the right person to lose her virginity with, Oz says he will stay and be happy with Heather, Finch plans a trip with Selena, Kevin can return to his wife, and Stifler plays coy about having sex with Finch's Mom, and they all toast to another reunion in the future. In the final bit we see Jim's Dad and Stifler's Mom together in the cinema, and after he puts his arm around her she smiles and gets down to give him a blowjob, his noises get everyone looking, and once he finishes he just says ""great movie"". Also starring Neil Patrick Harris as Celebrity Dance-Off Host and Chad Johnson. The cast may all be in their thirties now and not as youthful as before, but they are all still lovable characters and still bring their traits seen previously to the table. The story is simple enough, with just about enough sex, nudity, smut, crudeness and rudeness you would expect in the series, I will admit there were the small sequences of predictability and cheese, but there were funny moments, it is a good fun comedy. Worth watching!",American Reunion
4,tavm,American Reunion was another fun movie in the American Pie series,9,14 April 2012,"Having seen the previous American Pie movies when they were originally released and really enjoyed them, I definitely couldn't pass up the opportunity to watch this latest one. So yeah, I laughed just as much at this one as the others. I mean, all those memories of those previous ones were fondly recalled when certain scenes were mentioned especially Jim's initial encounter with a nude Nadia in the first one. But it wasn't only the gross out scenes or the ample nudity of certain actresses that was the attraction for me, it was also the heartwarming scenes between Jason Biggs and Eugene Levy as father and son that was also something worth seeing with, of course, the embarrassing way Levy brings certain subjects up that provide undercutting of humor to keep things from being too sentimental. Also welcome were the return of Alyson Hannigan as Jim's wife Michelle and especially Sean William Scott as the lovable obnoxious jerk Stifler. In summary, me and my movie theatre-working friend highly enjoyed revisiting old friends in American Reunion. Oh, and the cameo of a certain somebody involving a dance contest TV show was a real treat to me!",American Reunion

7,Boba_Fett1138,Seems like the series has lost their relevance and is simply being surpassed by other movies now days.,5,9 April 2012,"Really, it's important to say that I actually was a big fan of all of the previous American Pie movies but this latest establishment did absolutely nothing for me! The first ""American Pie"" movie, made back in 1999, was one that changed the genre, or at least sort of brought back the teenage sex comedies, by making it fun and daring again. The series, in my opinion, continued in good form, until this movie. Out of all the American Pie movies, this is the absolute most redundant and less innovative one.It's maybe also partly because of it that ever since the first ""American Pie"" movie, tons of similar movies got made and the bar got actually raised- and the genre reinvented again by a couple of other genre movies. This movie does absolutely nothing to try to raise the bar again, or become a relevant movie within its genre. Or maybe I'm just getting too old for these sort of movies and type of comedies but I highly doubt that, since I actually do like to watch genre movies like this one, from time to time, such as most recently ""Project X"", for instance.The main premise itself actually sounded quite good and promising; having a reunion with all of the characters from the first movie in it, 13 years after the first movie and 9 years after ""American Wedding"". But the thing is; the movie does absolutely nothing with its concept.I don't feel that any the characters have progressed at all. They are still all the same and don't look to have matured very much. It would had been interesting to see how their lives progressed and eventually ended up all but the movie really doesn't know how to handle this. What's the point of having the characters look back, while they haven't changed one bit. It already makes the main idea and concept of the movie an incredibly flawed one but there are far more problems with this movie.It just simply isn't a very well written or made movie. One of other problems with its story is that it wants to have far too many subplots in it. It also makes a movie called ""American Reunion"" shockingly little about an actual reunion. It doesn't even ever look or feel that some of these guys hadn't seen each other for years. It's just the same old, same old, with as a difference that we get to see a bunch of 30-year old's doing teenage stuff, which isn't all that compelling or tasteful, in my opinion. It certainly also makes the comedy of this movie more lacking as well.And because the movie tries to focus on so many characters and their story lines, none of them ever work out well enough. The movie doesn't develop or resolve any of them properly or satisfying enough, while the movie obviously did had some good ideas in it. Another thing with this movie is that you first need to have seen at least the very first movie. This is not a standalone movie. It very much is a sequel that relies a lot on it that its viewers are already familiar with all of the characters and what happened to them in the previous movies. It actually is important to watch the previous three movie, just prior to this one, or else you will miss a lot. Literally almost every character from the first ""American Pie"" movie pops up into this one, even if it's for just a couple of seconds. And even while I was a big fan of the first movies, I had absolutely no idea any more who all of these people were, or why they were relevant for this movie at all.A disappointment really and that is coming from a person who loved the first American Pie movies!5/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",American Reunion
8,neil-476,A familiar recipe,7,4 May 2012,"This film brings back nearly all the original cast for a film which has almost no surprises - it is a smutty high school comedy, with the protagonists more than a decade older.The story, such as it is, centres once more on the mishaps of Jim Levenstein - this time his intertwined problems are a) his tired sex life with Michelle and b) the attempts of 18 year old Kara next door who he used to babysit (the spectacularly constructed Ali Cobrin, who spends a gratifying amount of time half naked) to lose her virginity to him. But we see a fair amount of the others, Stifler is as crass and objectionable as ever, and there are a fair number of laughs (none of them subtle).This film doesn't really add anything of any consequence, but the characters are still mostly decent people in whose company it is good to spend time.And, as usual, Eugene Levy as Jim's Dad walks away with every scene he is in.",American Reunion
9,Uriah43,"Crude, Boring and Overrated",3,27 September 2019,"This movie begins with a married man by the name of ""Jim Levenstein"" (Jason Biggs) and his wife of 5 years ""Michelle"" (Alyson Hannigan) essentially encountering a lull in their marriage due in large part to a baby which has taken a toll on their sex life. But Jim's life is about to get a bit more exciting when he not only agrees to rejoin some of his buddies at their 13th high school reunion but he also meets a young 18-year old girl by the name of ""Cara"" (Ali Cobrin) who he used to babysit many years earlier. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film is basically one of many in the American Pie franchise which incorporates most of the same characters and adolescent humor. Admittedly, there are a couple of decent comedy scenes here and there along with some attractive women like Tara Reid (as ""Vicky""), Katrina Bowden (""Mia""), Jennifer Coolidge (""Stiffler's Mom"") and the aforementioned Ali Cobrin to enhance the scenery but other than that I found most of this film to be just crude and rather boring. That being said, I have rated it accordingly. Below average.",American Reunion
10,anaconda-40658,Reunite With the Original.,3,2 June 2015,"American Reunion (2012): Dir: Jon Hurwitz, Hayden Schlossberg / Cast: Jason Biggs, Alyson Hannigan, Chris Klein, Seann William Scott, Ali Cobrin: Dirty teen comedy franchise has ran its course with a reunion that seems to celebrate and reflect the crude level of humour. I enjoyed American Pie in its inventive take on familiar grounds. It was a film many teenagers can relate to, and even its crude humour had an element of surprise given the unique nature. Here we are thirteen years after the original, and while the entire cast return, it seems devoid of any new material outside from the usual level that streaked the two previous sequels. While screenplay and themes are pretty much as bare as Jim's naked ass, it does make a decent attempt to develop some of the characters. Jason Biggs returns as Jim, whose father is widowed and his sex life is devoid. Now he is faced with a possible fling with the girl next door whom he use to babysit. Chris Klein is dating a supermodel but struggles to live down being voted off a dance off, as well as his love for Heather. Seann William Scott as Stifler hasn't changed and will cling to immaturity until his vulgar charm wins you over. Many of the female roles are unwritten, especially Alyson Hannigan whose band camp girl grew up to marry Jim and have a bad sex life. Ali Cobrin plays Jim's neighbour whom he babysat when she was young. Now at eighteen they hook up and she soon bares all. I loved these characters in the original film but now the material has gone stale. While not quite as bad as previous sequels, the best reunion for viewers would be to reacquaint with the original film. Score: 3 ½ / 10",American Reunion
11,FlashCallahan,Another slice? just the one please....,6,11 July 2012,"Over a decade has passed and the gang return to East Great Falls, for the weekend.They discover how their lives have developed as they gather for their high school reunion.Has life treated Michelle, Jim, Heather, Oz, Kevin, Vicky, Finch, Stifler, and Stifler's mom the same as it did back in 1999? In that summer, it was four boys on a quest to lose their virginity.Now the girl Jim used to babysit is a cute high school senior looking for the perfect guy to lose her virginity to......The first thing you do is marvel at how the film makers have got literally everyone back one more time. Then you realise that not everyone in the film has had much success since (William Scott is probably the most famous now) and then you realise how little a lot of the cast have screen time.The film is about nostalgia, but the primary goal is to show the strain on Jim and Michelles marriage.They go back to basics with the humour, and most of the time, the jokes fall sadly flat. It appears to be pretty mundane stuff, until the actual reunion happens in the final third, and it really makes up for the blandness of the first two acts.Elizabeth, Reid, and the guy who plays Sherminator, didn't have to be in it, they bring nothing to the film apart from 'ooh look how different they look'.But if the rest of the film were like the last act, it would have been a classic comedy.The final act saves the movie, it will make you cheer, and even bring a tear to your eye.",American Reunion
12,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: American Reunion,7,5 April 2012,"It was 1999 that American Pie launched what would be a series of teenage sex comedies, given a relatively cost effective formula loaded with nudity and toilet humour, that exploded at the box office and made everyone sit up to take note which of its cast members would go on to make it big. The film spawned two more films that would culminate in a wedding, before going direct to video in the many spin offs lie Band Camp, Naked Mile, Beta House and Book of Love that had very little links to the main characters. It's almost a decade already, and it's perhaps time to put those spin off films to rest, and bring back the original cast and their characters to the big screen in a logical reunion. And why not, given that the individual cast members never really made it to the big league, that coming together in a show of unity may rekindle memories of an audience who grew up with them from 1999's original, and in some ways provide one last shot in the arm for their individual careers.And so it's a warm hello to old friends with whom we have last left off without much of a closure for all the characters, and like a real reunion, we discover just what our friends have been up to during the course of their absence in our lives. Some are successful, others not, and some are depending on what definition you're using. There's Jason Biggs as Jim Levenstein who's still married to Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) with a kid in tow and having trouble with their non-existent sex lives, Oz (Chris Klein) being a successful television sports anchor and celebrity with a model girlfriend (Katrina Bowden), Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) who's also happily married but dreading a very routine lifestyle filled with TV and more TV, who would have thought Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) being very much of an all round adventurer, and Stifler (Seann William Scott) the jock who, well, according to unwritten rules, finds himself in between jobs, getting really nowhere in his career, and still bearing a grudge towards Finch for nailing Stifler's Mom (Jennifer Coolidge).Some things never change too, as we usually find out during meet ups with old friends, old flames and once rivals, that when we rekindle the past, we'll at times tangent into the what ifs. And there are plenty of such situations that make up the narrative of Reunion, with Jim having to fend off the advances of his neighbour Kara (Ali Cobrin), whom he babysat a long time back and is now a nubile 18 year old eager to lose her virginity to Jim, and both Oz and Kevin discovering old feelings with their exes Heather (Mena Suvari) and Vicky (Tara Reid). Stifler faces challenges at work especially that threatens to cancel his attendance at the school reunion ball, while Finch seems to get onto a real relationship with Selena (Dania Ramirez).There's also the return of the evergreen favourite, Jim's dad (Eugene Levy), now a widower but still finding time to talk about sexuality very openly to an always embarrassed Jim, and that of a slew of supporting characters from the earlier films that I will not name to contain the surprise. But it's a full reunion as the filmmakers pulled out all the stops in order to make sure of a proper representation rather than a half-hearted event, in order not to short change the audience. And surprisingly though that directors Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg seemed to have restrained themselves a lot from their Harold and Kumar days, and like touching a holy grail of teenage sex comedies, treated the material and characters here with a lot of respect rather than going for the jugular because getting the team back together again with a valid excuse will seem like a long way ahead.But when the jokes came, they came fast and furious since we have Stifler in the party and ensuring that his posse of friends get the best deal out of their short weekend stay in town, and this balances out with more dramatic moments which can be seen coming from a mile away. Stifler's party forms the centerpiece where the you-know-what hits the fan, and for all the amount of nudity in the earlier movies, American Reunion would win for being the tamest of the lot, toning blatant nudity down by a lot of notches, and keeping things in relative PG mode as the narrative chugged along drama rather than comedy, for the most parts of the second half anyway.The first American Pie film garnered an R21 rating here, and this one, although having full front male genitalia on display, male on male kissing, the requisite foul language and subject matter that will earn it an R21 easily, its M18 rating perhaps also reflected a relatively loosening of ratings here in Singapore, although this remains to be seen whether one off, or gets sustained and gradually loosened up even more as time goes by. Still, American Reunion, whatever the rating, is definitely for franchise fans (whether considering the direct to video titles or not), and I really enjoyed how it went full circle in the group's reunion in their final scene together. If you're a fan, then what are you waiting for?",American Reunion
13,siderite,A good concept that was done right,7,21 July 2012,"This is a true sequel: it expands on a previous story and makes it better. American Pie was never a great film and the many reincarnations of the same story did not do it good, but American Reunion almost fixes everything, giving it a true human dimension. In my opinion, it is this film that makes American Pie a classic. I just hope they don't turn it into another franchise. Let it rest, people! You got it right, don't mess with it.Other than that, the same crazy antics, part felony, part madness and the same awkward situations, but with a more adult touch.

15,StevePulaski,A refreshing slice of reassurance,8,7 April 2012,"It's hard to believe it has been thirteen years since lovable characters like Jim, Oz, Kevin, and Finch were desperately trying to lose their virginity before Senior year ended. We followed these guys around for pre-graduation fun in American Pie, vacationed at a beach house in American Pie 2, and when our lead character Jim got married in American Wedding. We then endured four relentlessly incompetent and immature spinoffs that were not only banking on the name, but sticking in names like ""Matt Stifler"" in a desperate attempt to link them with the original trilogy. I began to believe never again would I give another American Pie film a positive rating. Then along came a reunion.Some would say that a reunion with characters we met only a mere thirteen years ago isn't necessary. I believe it was immensely necessary. We were stuffed with dry, tasteless spinoffs of the franchise from 2005 through 2011, and I believe, many teens discovered those films oblivious to the original trilogy. It was a treat to see these characters come back for one last time, providing much deserved laughs after an endless sea of monotony and nihilism.If that's what you want, American Reunion delivers. The story is simplicity itself, much like the three previous films. After a high school reunion is planned, the East Great Falls class of '99 returns to their hometown to see what has changed, what hasn't, and to meet up with the friends they have somewhat lost contact with. Jim (Biggs) is still married to the beautiful Michelle (Hannigan), now with a two year old child, but their sex life has gone south. If you've seen the first three movies, you automatically know how this one will open.Oz (Klein), who was wholly absent from American Wedding, has become a sportscaster with a very beautiful girlfriend. Yet it is inevitable he will collide with Heather (Suvari), the ""choir chick"" whom taught him to be more sensitive. Kevin (Nicholas) returns, married and victim to consistent reality shows, and Finch (Thomas) has proved himself to be successful, traveling across the world, yet stuck in a rut when it comes to relationships. But let's not forget Stifler (Scott), and no, he hasn't settled down.Again, one of the funniest characters in the film is Jim's forgiving father, played by Eugene Levy. After his mother's tragic passing, he can see that his father's life is now noticeably vacant. Jim has the idea that in order to meet more women, his father must create a dating profile. The idea could've sparked an untold amount of awkwardness and anxiety, but it seems the idea was abandoned on arrival. Still, we get plenty of healthy laughs when the iconic mom of Stifler (Coolidge) comes into play.In one of the countless subplots in the film, Jim reconnects with a girl he used to babysit, named Kara, played by the beautiful and talented Ali Cobrin. Now that she's turning eighteen, she's looking for the perfect guy to lose her virginity to, and Jim came along at the right time. Ali Cobrin played in a Television series called Look, a devilishly entertaining show that centered around a number of people, whose lives with intertwined with each other. The trick was the show was all shot with surveillance footage. It's nice to see Cobrin's full acting talents come forth in a mainstream film. It's also nice to see variety and even this late in the characters' lives, they are still meeting new people. They aren't confined to the same old friends.Directors/screenwriters Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg, the writers for the three Harold and Kumar films, definitely have knowledge and respect for the original Pie trilogy. This is the first real film of the series not to be written by Adam Herz, whom created this lovable band of characters. The writing still mixes shameless raunchiness with heart and depth to its humor, but its main reliance is on nostalgia.It seems every few minutes, a character is referencing past events from the first three films. This makes me skeptical if a person going into this without the knowledge of the previous three will understand where a lot of the humor derives from. I'm glad I revisited the original trilogy a week or so before seeing this, so I was fully prepared.American Reunion is a wonderful revival to a series that needed one. Its script, though written by different people, captures the energy and fun nicely, the actors all remember how to portray their characters and hit the right notes, the characters themselves still resemble those of a sitcom, who we still look forward to seeing every now and then, and every one of them, including some surprise cameos, gets their own time to shine. It is a bit sad to see one character literally just get a minute of screen time, cough, cough the underrated Natasha Lyonne, but after a seemingly empty Wedding, it is nice to see the original gang at least make some sort of an appearance. After three healthy slices and four rotten ones, we come across a slice that is reassuring and refreshing. Something I never thought I'd say.NOTE: If I were you, I'd sit through the credits. Not only is there an additional scene moments after the film ends, but the film's credits carry on with scenes from the original trilogy and the fourth one we just watched. It's like watching old memories with friends that you haven't seen for so long. Wholesomeness is the word.Starring: Jason Biggs, Alyson Hannigan, Chris Klein, Thomas Ian Nicholas, Eddie Kaye Thomas, Tara Reid, Seann William Scott, Mena Suvari, Natasha Lyonne, Eugene Levy, and Jennifer Coolidge. Directed by: Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg.",American Reunion
16,lasttimeisaw,American Reunion,6,7 April 2012,"Nearly a decade later, this orthodox fourth installment of American PIE shuffles along with a reunion gimmick which encompasses almost exactly the same gags and repellent discomforts as in its groundbreaking first episode came around 1997, which makes one wonder the audience's laughing threshold is still on the par with the level 15 years ago. There are ample laughters from A to Z, no one-liner or wisecrack, mainly generated by risqué pranks and lecherous sex-related pratfalls. I cannot deny that I had a great laughter while committing to the moment, but a post-mortem self-reflection does leave no trace of anything is worth chewing.The entire cast has returned with new blood like Ali Cobrin, Katrina Bowden and Jay Harrington, but the highlights belong to doyens like Levy and Coolidge, also Rebecca De Mornay's surprisingly laughter-burst cameo is right on time. Clearly boys are aging much well than their counterpart girl mates, which means both physical and psychological age, and there will always be a copious supply of luscious high school hotties coming on their way for straight horny males, while 30-ish girls/women could only be sidelined as wallflowers unless you're Mornay or Coolidge, whose cups of tea are beyond one's average nous (toy boy and widower respectively). Along with the trends of HANGOVER series and Judd Apatow era, American REUNION is retrospectively profitable with its core audience's maturation, and if the future projects will keep the same pace, once in a decade, this franchise may thrive well as long as it will connect with the pulse of its generation.",American Reunion

The film is very hit and miss for laughs but if you're a fan of the series you'll probably be happy to see the gang all back together for the most part.Jim (Biggs) and Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) Levenstein are now married with a kid. Their sex life has died off and both have turned to self pleasuring. They decide to go back to East Great Falls, Michigan for their ten-year reunion and stay with Jim's dad (Eugene Levy, who's the only one to appear in all eight films), who's now a widower. The tables have turned and it's now Jim giving his father sex advice and encouraging him to get back out there and meet a woman. Jim's friends Oz (Chris Klein), Kevin (Thomas Ian Nichols), Finch (Thomas) and Stifler (Scott) all have problems of their own as each tries to recapture their youth and find happiness again. For Jim it's all about reconnecting with his wife, which becomes especially difficult when the neighbor girl (Ali Cobrin), he used to babysit as a kid, comes on to him and wants him to take her virginity.The movie is hilarious at times and falls pretty flat at others. There are definitely moments when it feels like the filmmakers and cast are trying just a little too hard but the characters are so likable that it doesn't matter. If you're a fan of the series they're like a family that's nice to see again so it doesn't matter if everything they do is that funny anymore, they're still family. Stifler makes the movie once again but all of the characters are nicely developed. It's definitely got a good nostalgic feel to it and while it may not live up to the original, or even the first two sequels, it's still nice to see the gang all back together again. Like 'SCREAM 4' (a similar reunion film) the film disappointed a little at the American box-office but it did kill overseas (which is a little surprising that 'AMERICAN PIE' is more popular outside of America). True fans of the original and the series should be delighted despite it's flaws.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhcS7Q-CkYE",American Reunion
18,thesar-2,See You at the 13-Year-Reunion!,8,6 January 2013,"Okay, forget that enormous plot-hole of a 13-Year-High-School-Reunion; American Reunion is a fabulous and fraking hilarious romp.Picture it: 1999. I saw the original American Pie in the theatre and laughed so hard throughout with the packed audience. When I saw it again on video (yeah, it was called video back then when it was released on, more accurately, ""home video,"") I didn't laugh so much, but I did appreciate it. And then came the sequels.Part 2 was awful. Part 3, or Wedding, was painful. Skipping over the spin offs, à la this generation's National Lampoon's, I kinda felt they were going to do right with the Reunion. And I was so much pleased.From what I can recall, it's been a very long time since I've seen an ""American"" film that enormously captured the magic, humor, heart, depth and joy the original produced within me. In fact, I would match this completely in line with the original in quality and entertainment.Jim, Jim's Dad and virtually every other living cast member of the original American Pie romp reunite in their small town of East Great Falls, MI, for a bit of partying, learning, growing and sexing.There's no real deep meaning here; this is strictly comedy with a tiny touch of reality. It's not meant to be taken seriously. It's more meant for my generation to see where our lives are really going and to laugh along with people seeing what we see. I do see what they see and even though I am actually much older, I still can relate.Scream 4 came out in 2011 and while the original Scream was made a few years before American Pie's pilot, I kinda grew up with both. It was nice to see a ""Part IV"" for both series I've spent years with, although, this is the one I really think captured the original heart of what I felt more than a decade ago.Way to go guys. And thanks, finally, for the full-frontal male nudity. About time!",American Reunion

20,Robert_duder,No one does raunchy better...and they prove it 13 years later,8,5 September 2012,"American Pie proved that the raunch comedies which are common place now can actually be funny, have heart and characters and story. I hate the stupid raunchy comedies now that just aim to shock you into laughing. American Pie was great because it dealt with coming of age angst, ridiculous over the top scenarios that just horrified you and best friends. The entire cast just worked so well together and it was just a dream come true to have them all come back together. It is the perfect reunion. It still deals with coming of age in an essence, life, moving on, old friends and getting older. It was the perfect follow up for people my age who were American Pie age throughout the series. There are plenty of shocking outrageous and gross moments but through it all there is such a huge amount of heart and story and friendship that it actually makes you nostalgic. You just relate so well to the characters and every entry in the series including this one make you feel just like you're part of the gang. I consider American Wedding the only entry in the theatrically released Pie movies that wasn't up to par but Reunion was probably as good as the first.What can you say about this cast? Jason Biggs is still outrageously and perfectly awkward as Jim. Chris Klein gives his best performance as Oz to date, its far less rigid and more human than previous films. Thomas Ian Nicholas and Eddie Kaye Thomas are back in full form as Kevin and Finch. Alyson Hannigan, who has come such a long way as a character in this series, is just excellent as Michelle. She really encompasses growing up for a woman and motherhood and being a wife. Tara Reid and Mena Suvari also return but on a smaller almost cameo like extent. Eugene Levy, of course, who gained cult status as ""Jim's Dad"" is just brilliant. He shows a whole different side of ""coming of age"" as he tries to deal with moving on from the loss of his wife. This turn for his character is just fantastic. You won't miss a single person from the original two films as everyone has a cameo including Jennifer Coolidge, John Cho, Natasha Lyonne and more. And last but certainly not least is Sean William Scott as the vivacious and never ending Stifler. In previous instalments they almost overused him constantly. His wild outrageous and downright raunchy talk and actions make him hilarious but dangerously overused. However, I thought they did a great job at keeping him just where he needed to be and even giving him a little bit of a heartfelt storyline at the same time.This cast works so well together that you won't even believe that its been 13 years since the first film. It is literally like a group of best friends that never left each others side. Bravo to Harold and Kumar writers, creators and directors Hayden Schlossberg and Jon Hurwitz who know how to have a good time but best of all they kept everything we loved about American Pie in tact and alive. If you've ever seen the first one or two or any of the films and hated them then I promise you, you will hate this one because this is exactly what American Pie was meant to be. Fans of the other films will love every minute of this fantastic reunion with the old gang. 8.5/10",American Reunion
21,bowmanblue,The Pie is past it's sell by date (but only just),6,29 May 2014,"Like many, I loved the first American Pie film. It was daft, silly, immature and totally funny. Its two sequels did their best to stay true to the original and, in my opinion, did a decent job.Now comes the reunion. Set just over ten years after the guys graduated high school. The first thing I have to say is that it is great to see them all together again. They still have the endearing chemistry which made the previous films such a success (and on a side note, they barely seem to have aged a bit - for that I can only hate them). However, for all the nostalgic enjoyment I got from seeing the whole gang together again, I felt this one was the most strained.In short: I didn't laugh as much as any of the previous entries in the franchise. Not saying that it wasn't funny - I laughed more times than with most comedy films. Plus it was hardly an Adam Sadler movie, it just didn't have as many laugh out loud moments as I'm used to with a 'Pie' flick.I didn't feel like I'd wasted my time, but it is nearly two hours and the jokes were starting to come few and far between. Instead, they were replaced with predictable sentiment which, although sweet, just wasn't much of a substitute for gross-out humour.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",American Reunion

And to like this, you need to have seen the original and how many 17 year olds of today have seen that. But besides the fact that this sequel is way too late, it still uses a lot of the same jokes. The hot chick next door that shows some skin. Stifler still talking like he's in high school. The gross out pranks. And of course Jim and the sock in the beginning. Oz is back and a celebrity dance off contestant and has this hilarious scene with the neighbor's wife whose a big fan.FINAL VERDICT: It is good for what it is, if you want to laugh at gross stuff, check it out.",American Reunion
23,g-bodyl,A Trip Down Memory Lane,8,26 November 2013,"American Reunion which is the long-awaited film featuring all the original characters from the original trilogy has arrived. If anything, this film offers up some sweet moments of nostalgia. While not as funny as the original films, this film still manages some hilarious moments and it's always nice to see these characters back together. Needless to say, this film almost makes me forget those atrocious direct-to-DVD sequels.This film is about how our favorite gang of Jim, Oz, Finch, Kevin, and Stifler grew up or should we say ""not grown up."" We head to the high school reunion and we see that maybe these guys haven't left high school left.It's nice to see all these characters back together again. I love how Jim gets himself in awkward situations still, how Stifler is still that obnoxious brat, how Finch is so mysterious, how Oz is a big hotshot, and how Kevin is a stay-at-home architect.Overall, this is a pretty funny film that offers up a few big laughs. The first scene was by far the best thing about the film. It's really nice to be taking this trip down memory lane because I hold the first three films dearly to my heart. This passes for a good reunion. I rate this film 8/10.",American Reunion

I say B.",7,6 July 2012,"""It is so great to see all you kids back in town. And what a terrific soirée are you throwing here tonight. Just wonderful."" 13 years after graduation the whole gang finally returns for their high school reunion. Lives have changed and old friends have drifted apart. The first night the gang gets back together old feelings come back and new problems arrive. Just when you think things can't go worse...they do. I'm not sure the term growing up with this movie applies because the first one came out when I was in college, but that's what it felt like. I remember the first one being so amazingly funny and raunchy and unlike anything that had come out until then. Fast forward to today and if you re-watch that one it seems so tame and almost PG-13 compared to todays movies. What I noticed about this one first off is that besides being funny it had a lot more heart in it then the recent high school drinking movies. Also unlike most sequels being made long after the series stopped this one actually made sense to do one and the writing was actually pretty good. All that said this is still an ""American Pie"" movie meaning there are some over the top scenes and the gang gets into things that seem to get worse and worse. As usual the best scenes involve Jim's (Biggs) Dad (Levy) and actually Stiffler seemed more tame in this one then the others. I have to say though that the ending of this one was perfect. Overall, for a fan of the series this is a great closer and I recommend it. I give it a B.",American Reunion
25,slightlymad22,Still Laughs To Be Had,7,9 February 2015,"American reunion is a nice addition to the American Pie franchise.

Plot In A Paragraph: It has been over a decade since the gang graduated from East Great Falls. They will discover how their lives have developed as they meet up for their high school reunion. How has life treated Michelle, Jim, Heather, Oz, Kevin, Vicky, Finch, Stifler, and Stifler's mom? In the summer of 1999, it was four boys on a quest to lose their virginity. Now Kara is a cute high school senior looking for the perfect guy to lose her virginity to.Some of the cast have aged more than others, but that's probably down I problems in their real lives.

26,Floated2,Lived Up to Expectations,7,18 October 2013,"American Reunion is the 4th instalment in the American Pie Series. Having seen the previous three films in the franchise, my expectations were high but I was not expecting too much from viewing the trailer. I can say American Reunion lived up to my expectations. The comedy om this film is very well done and the chemistry between the leads are still there. The story is also quite interesting as we see more in the life of Jim (Jason Biggs), his wife Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) and his lifetime friends.Nostalgia definitely goes deep for many people and this is a reason why many have enjoyed this sequel. We see all the cast comeback and have its reunion and newer tension between some of the new members with recurring members. One new character in particular is Kara, a female whom Jim babysat in his younger years. Now she is much older and having just turned 18, so we get to see more of her reacting with Jim whom he did not realize it was her until she brought it up. Things of course get awkward yet entertaining in a couple scenes (Jim takes her home one night being drunk, a few top less scenes, then sneaking her back into her home). Her scenes were some of the highlights of the film. Others including scenes with Stiffler (he's the same as in American Wedding), and Finch. Overall American Reunion delivers on a very solid sequel and fans of the original franchise will much enjoy this. We can only see what happens next.",American Reunion
27,johnnyboyz,"Watchable for sake of completion, but not much else.",5,10 September 2019,"'If there was more dancing in the world, there'd be fewer wars'. Interesting conceit, but I think ultimately foolhardy. Besides, dancing was banned under the Taliban, wasn't it? War in Afghanistan, therefore, technically liberated a people so that they may dance should they wish to; war equating, in this instance, to the right to dance. But I digress. ""American Reunion"" isn't about dancing, although there is a little bit of it in there; at its core seems to be the question as to whether sexual intercourse is for procreation or recreation, epitomised in a narrative about a sexless, though certainly not loveless, marriage between two people who already have one child and cannot quite find the spark they once had.I was never of the opinion that there was anything especially nefarious about the ""American Pie"" films of 1999 to 2003; they were merely a goofy product of our system and its attitudes, not a source of them. Certainly, at the centre of the first film was a lesson about what happened when you allowed certain attitudes to consume you; when you charged into the great unknown ill-prepared because you felt you had to more-so because you wanted to. The other two were, broadly speaking, mere farces and didn't have an especially good idea of what to do with themselves.This 2012 effort, ""American Reunion"", the second best in the series, is somewhat different. It depicts the East Grand Rapids High School gang as actual adults: some are married; some are fathers, most of them work but all are a long way from where they want to be. Shedding their virginities all those years ago on a prom night under a self-imposed air of coming of age, or rite of passage, did not make them millionaires or land them ideal life-situations.The franchise has taken a gear-change in this respect, though it stops well short of opening with a Cormac McCarthy-esque monologue read in the style of Tommy Lee-Jones; trying instead to distinguish between what life for 16-18 year olds is like in 2012 compared to the dying embers of last century and the first few years of the new one. It has one of the crew, Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas), verbally outline how things have changed: girls are looser; young people are ruder and social networking has taken relations to a whole new level. What he neglects to point out is that if social media had existed fifteen years earlier, his generation would have used it in exactly the same fashion because the underlying issue is one of morality and not modernity.As is form, the film revolves around the character of Jim (Jason Biggs), who, after the last film, is married to Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) and has an infant son. The film depicts two major factors in Jim's life combining over the timespan of one weekend: his frustration at possessing a sexless marriage and his high-school reunion, where the class of '99 and all the old faces are set to congregate back in the old Michigan town of East Great Falls. Backing up the central narrative are various stories involving the old crew: Oz (Chris Klein), whose first lines after missing the last film are ""...and we're back!""; Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas); the aforementioned Kevin and the irreplaceable Stifler (Seann William Scott).Arriving home to stay with his Dad, portrayed of course by Eugene Levy, temptation drops head-first into Jim's life in the form of Kara (Ali Cobrin), the girl next door whom he used to babysit but has now grown up into his own personal siren. We can tell he likes her because the film shoots her running over her lawn from Jim's gaze, a common technique to establish degrees of erotic wanting in a character. Our alarm bells continue to ring when we recall that the pornography Jim was looking at before the trip was college girl themed and that Kara fits this demographic. Admittedly, it is somewhat amusing to see the film transgress Jim's behaviour after, having been desperate for female contact the first time we met him, must now dead-bat female attention when it is she who possesses the societal urge to shed HER virginity.Flimsier is the sub-plot to do with Oz who, for reasons of requiring a beefier runtime, gets his own story to do with bumping into his old girlfriend - the film-makers making up for lost time after he skipped ""The Wedding"", perhaps. Oz is already married and his old flame is seeing somebody here, a doctor who is preposterously pretentious because the story needs to be fast-tracked. Later on, the plot-line will resort to Oz's wife taking ecstasy at a rowdy party to move things along. Elsewhere, some things work in the film, but most things do not. Characters need to be deaf; dumb and blind for much of the comedy to work: the louts whose beer and jet-skis Stifler ruins and Kara's parents when Jim tries to smuggle her back into her house, for instance.We've lived with these characters for years through three other films, but there is no tremendous emotional crescendo to see them off - the tone leaping manically from heartfelt 'first love' reminiscing to frenzied comedy and back again at the reunion whose soundtrack cues eerily change at precisely the right moment to suit the conversation or exchange. Jim's epiphany, that he should 'find time' for sex in order to maintain his marriage, doesn't work for the simple reason it is a tactic he has already been trying up to this point anyway. It would be easy, for nostalgia's sake, to fall into liking ""Reunion"", and it has its moments, but there just isn't enough meat in this would-be pie to get suckered.",American Reunion
28,TheMovieDiorama,American Pie Reunion is a social gathering that relies too heavily on nostalgia.,4,11 August 2018,"Obviously the purpose of a reunion is to recall memories with friends and family where hopefully laughter and happiness is everywhere. In theory, that's how it should work. Although practicality is a different flavoured pie altogether, where this pie has crumbled into an unfunny pile of crumbs. The class of 1999 organise a high school reunion which leads to old sexual sparks being reignited. It's an ensemble sex comedy. Much like the first, second and third theatrical entries in the franchise. The premise, plot, characters and jokes remain the same. That was slightly humorous back in 1999 when the characters were hormonal teenagers looking to lose their virginity. Now, with them all becoming well-established in their lives and careers, to use the same raunchiness and sexual behaviour becomes outdated. That pretty much sums this comedy up. Obsolete. The screenplay is completely reliant on nostalgia, where identical jokes are recycled from the original, that it prevents the franchise from progressing forward. Director/writers Hurwitz and Schlossberg clearly lacked the bravura and bravery to advance the series, and it shows within the first five minutes when Jim grabs a sock for his personal pleasure (again). Funny 13 years ago, not funny now. Stifler and Jim's dad are really the only characters that are funny. The plot itself is just a mixture of sub-plots that forcibly attempt to develop the characters in a typical ""friendship is important"" moral, just like the other instalments. How many of the same scenarios must these characters undergo to adhere to this message? Seriously! I will say that the returning of all the original cast members was required, it was interesting to see how they've all physically changed. The balance between each of the main characters, given the modest runtime and extensive cast list, was exceptionally executed. Aside from that, this pie has expired. Fans of the franchise will enjoy the onscreen shenanigans, others will forget about its bland unfunny flavouring.",American Reunion

Virtually the entire cast of ""American Pie"" (1999) and ""American Pie 2"" (2001) are on-hand here - and believe me, that's a good thing. The only bad part? That some characters get more time than others, but that's mostly only in regard to some of the secondary characters from the first two movies. (This happens to be the film's only real weakness - a foreseeable weakness, in my opinion, and one that could be easily over-looked - as it tries to cram everybody from the earlier films into this one for one last American Hurrah, or ""American Reunion."") Jim (Jason Biggs) and Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) are now parents but are going through some tough marital difficulties. Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) is a stay-at-home husband/architect. Oz (Chris Klein) is a big-shot sportscaster. Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) is apparently M.I.A., but manages to find time to hook up with a now-smoking-hot former classmate named Selena (Dania Ramirez), who now works as a bartender. And Stifler (Seann William Scott) is a temp at some big law firm with an a**hole for a boss. In their travels where they're back in town to celebrate their 1999 class reunion, they manage to reunite with old flames - Kevin meets up with Vicki (Tara Reid), and Oz gets together with Heather (Mena Suvari). Foreign exchange beauty Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth), out-of-the-closet alternative hip chick Jessica (Natasha Lyonne), and Sherman/""The Sherminator"" (Chris Owen) also make surprising appearances. The grown folks Jim's Dad (Eugene Levy) and Stifler's Mom (Jennifer Coolidge - MILF) get in on some of the fun also. And somewhere in there, Our Aging Heroes, wax nostalgic and remember the good times all the way back in 1999 and 2001, and make way for a new generation of American Raunch. Co-directors Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg have made a fitting end to this series of outstanding raunchiness in the post-""There's Something About Mary"" era, when it seemed that all good taste in the movies had all been eliminated. There are many laughs to be had here at Our Heroes' expense, but it all works out in the best for the end. And it's also pretty gross sometimes, too, but it's all good-natured, gross-out humor - the same good-natured, gross-out humor that made the ""American Pie"" series at the end of the 20th century.A great ""American Reunion"" that you'll only end up regretting for the rest of your life if you miss it.10/10",American Reunion

""American Reunion"" congregates the gang of Jim, Oz, Kevin, Finch, Stifler, and of course Jim's Dad. The gals join in the fun also as Michelle, Vicky, Heather, and of course Stifler's Mom also get a little taste of that old pie. The film is set 13 years after the gang graduates and rejoins them of course in a reunion. Jim is still married to Michelle and now they have a son, Oz is a sports anchor who is more famous for physically dancing around in a ""Dancing with the Stars"" program than for verbally sporting around in sports newscasts, Finch is still a Mother Fincher (well, maybe not), and Kevin is happily married but not to Vicky. Oh and Stifler, well let's just say that he is still the same stiff of the old block. ""American Reunion"" even brings all the other supporting players back to the party- like the MILF Boys, the Sherminator, Jessica and yea, Nadia. No one was absent in this reunion. What was present is the same old lunacy scenes that branded the franchise with plenty of hijinks; and yes, once again Jim gets the biggest piece of those profanely embarrassing moments. Directors Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg do a decent (yet not overwhelming) job in presenting and scribing the realism of growing older, and gradually realizing that we are not the same as we were in our youth; but there is always the Stifler Exception, just watch the flick and you will see why. There is nothing revelatory about ""American Reunion"", it will not rock your world, but it might bring you back when you use to rock your world, or at least you thought so. The ensemble cast of Jason Biggs (Jim), Alyson Hannigan (Michelle), Chris Klein (Oz), Thomas Ian Nicholas (Kevin), Tara Reid (Vicky), Mena Suvari (Heather), Eddie Kaye Thomas (Finch), and Jennifer Coolidge (Stifler's Mom) contributed fine performances once again to the series. But the standouts of the franchise still continue to be Seann William Scott as Stifler and Eugene Levy as Jim's Dad. Sure it was an easy paycheck for all of them, but if you can get a little piece of that last pie, you might as well ka-ching it in.

As long as you were a fan of the original of course. Jim and the gang return for their high school reunion. Jim's distressed at the lack of sex since his son was born. Kevin is now married and is forced to watch women's programmes. Oz is now a sportscaster. Finch travelled the world, and Stifler is working as an intern. The film is mostly about recapturing youth, whilst trying remain responsible. Basically, the message is about striking a good balance and taking time for ourselves and old friends amongst all the dull hardships of life. Each cast member slips effortlessly into their old roles, with Scott bringing the cringe-worthy, inappropriate humour. A lot of the old cast are paraded through for cameos. Stand outs include John Cho reprising his role as MILF Guy #2. This extended cameo is perhaps the highlight, playing on the fact that Cho became one of the most recognisable stars. A lot of the jokes are exactly the same, but unlike The Hangover 2, this worked because it's been a while. The script knows where its strengths lie, but it also has trouble utilising everybody. Ian Nicholas has the least to do, but this hardly matters as his character ran his course in the first two films.

36,rgkarim,An Awkward Teen Movie That Brings Both Old and New Laughs,8,7 April 2012,"It's crude, it's rude, it's awkward, and it's American PIE. Yes, as most of you know the latest installment to the American Pie franchise opened this weekend and fans of all ages flocked to the theater. Now, if you are like me, you may have been rolling your eyes in shame, fear, or a combination of both at this modern day sequel. However, I'm here to say that too my surprise this American Pie was perhaps my second favorite of the series, only falling behind American Pie 2 slightly. Surprising right, well if you are interested to hear about this movie, then keep on reading as I review American Pie Reunion.So what do I have to say to this movie? Well for one thing, this is a movie whose humor you have to be a fan of as it is not one of the generic comedies that seem to plague the movie theaters these days. Those who are fans of the series will be happy to hear the crude humor is back in full swing, with many of the gang retaining their personalities despite these past nine years. The awkward humor is still well timed with the directors managing to develop the shots to make every scene as embarrassing as it can be. Combine this with a dialog that is filled with cursing, innuendos, and of course Stifler's (Seann William Scott) classic rowdy comedy and you have a recipe for an awkward teenage comedy. It seems these last nine years have left Scott's talent for playing the arrogant jock left untouched and much of the audience, myself included, couldn't help but laugh at his presentation of classic one liners. However, the master of awkward moments goes to Jason Biggs who plays Jim Levenstein. Biggs seems to have a natural talent for not only falling into awkward situations, but also reacting to them, which made me chuckle at his bad luck. His facial gestures and nervous way of speaking adds more to moment, which had a number of my friends cracking up at the scenes left and right. The other three guys of the movie, Oz (Chris Klein), Kevin Thomas Ian Nicholas), and Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) have their funny moments as well, but for the most part they are used as tools to teach the moral lessons this movie tries to offer. The actor who probably made me laugh the most however is Eugene Levy who plays Mr. Levenstein. Levy's seems to naturally be awkward as his talent to give uncomfortable talks, provide interesting advice, and be a geek experiencing new things is still one of the best I have seen. I couldn't stop laughing at his scenes due to the combination of his facial gestures and delivery of dialog, which provided me a break from Stifler comedy. However, what surprised me was how little the women were involved with the comedy. Unlike its predecessors, the girls didn't have too many comedic lines in this film. A majority of their role was again providing that moral compass that kept the guys on track and only providing a few laughs here and there..A couple of other things to say about this film are the nostalgia it provides. Countless scenes in the movie brought me back to the memories I had of the prequels and I was impressed how they used the past to influence the comedy of the present. The directors also did a nice job providing tons of other movie references in this film, which for a critic like me had me in stitches because it was a nice break from the sexual comedy. The pace of the movie was good as well, not too slow and drawn out as I feared it would be. Although the comedy did grow stale at some parts, I was relieved I wasn't beaten over the head with innuendos, or annoying one-liners. However, don't think there weren't a few negatives to go along with this movie. There were various points in the movie where the production crew took the jokes too far. My friends and I couldn't help but cringe, and nearly gag on our food when they showed some of the more mature items and there were a few Stifler lines that kind of crossed the line as well. A few of my friends were also a little disappointed with how diluted some of the roles were in this movie, again the girls and a few of the guys really didn't provide that many laughs like we had seen in the past. Fans also looking for big surprises may also be in for a bit of a shock, because guess what the movie is still predictable as ever, but I went in expecting this so that wasn't as big of an issue. So let's wrap this up. American Reunion is definitely a nice change from the modernized comedy. The actors have retained their ability to play their characters, still know how to deliver dialog at the right times, and still can provide some new awkward humor. Fans who want to relive the past of American Pie will also get a blast from the past, maybe even enough to help new fans catch up. However, I strongly urge caution for younger audience members as again this film does step over the line in a few places, and does get a bit stale in the later stages of the movie. I recommend seeing this film in a group, like I did, to share in the awkwardness together, but if you have to see it go for Eugene Levy as he will not fail you. My scores for this movie are the following:",American Reunion
37,Movie-ManDan,They're Back with what May be the Best Sequel.,10,25 July 2014,"Jim, Michelle, Kevin, Finch, Stifler, Stifler's mom, Jim's dad, and the MILF guys are all back again. Making their triumphant returns include Oz, Heather, Vicki, Jessica, Nadia, and Sherman. It has been a long time since the group has been together, and their high school reunion is the place to reunite. With jobs and families, these friends want to relive some memories for old time's sake. But the re-sparks of old flames and battles of current teenagers proves that things have changed.One thing that every original American Pie movie had was the strength in comedy and character development. Nothing has changed in this. The comedy is still sidesplitting and the characters are so deep that you will fall in love with them again. Like American Pie, there is a perfect mix of drama and comedy. Unlike American Wedding, there is an even distribution of character development. Yes the characters have changed and do change more, but you can still see the same high school kid from 1999 underneath it all.4/4",American Reunion
38,raulfaust,American life,6,1 May 2012,"Friends from the class of 99 get together after some years. Most characters (actually, actors) are pretty much the same, with exception of Oz (Chris Clain), who seems to be much older than he was in the original version. ""American Reunion"" has the same formula of the original version, but this time they try to make a nostalgic version of that teenager classic. I'm not allowed to say I'm disappointed with this movie, since I already knew how it would be. I like the plot of these movies, but sometimes it feels they only talk about sex, masturbation and these things, as if life didn't have anything else to offer. There are plenty of funny scenes, the actors are all professional, but from the get go you can already imagine what's gonna happen and how it will end. All in all, ""American Reunion"" does a great job in its genre, but doesn't add anything new to the genre or to this franchise.",American Reunion
39,eric262003,Gang is Back For More Wild Misadventures,7,30 May 2021,"Is it just me or does Stifler's mother (Jennifer Coolidge) goes into hibernation and only ever comes out until the next addition to the 'American Pie"" franchise? While waiting for her son and his friend's to get together, I imagine her, sitting in her room, sitting on her recliner, touching up on her cherry lipstick ready to sink her teeth in hopes that his little friends come out to play with her. When we first get introduced to her, Jeanine was a total knockout. Cut to 13 years later in ""American Reunion"", it looks like as though her character has never fully changed. It might appear stunning to some of the male audiences, but to me it feels rather tragic.It seems that not just Jeanine but Stifler himself have not seemed to change in their characters while the other members of the gang have now gone on to get married, have jobs and have kids as well. To indicate that they know Stifler is still the same person he was back in their high school days, they don't even want Stifler to know that they're throwing a big reunion party knowing Stifler's somewhat reputation for causing chaos and being a bit rowdy.Even though the cast are playing the parts of the gang reuniting for the first time, the real cast themselves actually feel like they've reunited and the reactions and emotions are very organic and the gang in this forth part seems to have a stronger connection than they did when they started back in 1999. It's nice that each of the characters have an update from the last time we saw them together. Oz (Chris Klein) is now a sportscaster who is now dating a hot model. Jim and Michelle (Jason Biggs and Alyson Hannigan) still remained married all these years and now have a son, but find their sex life is in a rut as they're both battling commitments like holding a job/s and raising a child. Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) is home-employee who works as an architect. And finally Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) is an explorer who climbs mountains and.goes to exotic nightclubs. Vicky (Tara Reid) is a veteran employee who's been working in the same New York firm for the last 10 years. While Heather (Mena Suvari) is an intern at a hospital who has a boyfriend who's a cardiologist (Jay Harrington). In a strange subplot a girl that Jim baby-sat once (Ali Cobrin) is noe grown-up and is itching to lose her viginity, with Jim, which might be a little unorthodox, even for ""American Pie"" standards.Coming back is Jim's dad Noah Levenstein (Eugene Levy who appeared in all the ""American Pie"" movies even the direct-to-video spin-offs) with tips on the perfect method for sexually based activities and comically finding himself in awkward situations. There was a memorable scene involving Noah when a girl tries to give him a makeover and one of those procedues involves plucking off his overly bushy eyebrows. He stops her on his tracks telling her its his trademark. We feel more saddened for him this time around as he's now been a widow for three years and can't fully seem to get over it.Sure it felt natural that teens were sex driven individuals back in their high school, and the original ""American Pie"" film showcases that in a comical, but logical perspective. And sure as you get older the testoserone and sex drive diminshes, the gang still have that same level of sex drive that they had back in their youth. It might be a bit awkward for their age, but still proves many laughs.The character who still provides you with the most laughs is Seann William Scott in his role as Stifler, truly making this character his own and stealing every scene he's in. His wild demeanour, over-the-top reactions and his ability cause mischief is pure genius. The scene where he destroyed jet skis belonging to two jerks is purely poetic.And sure the root of the popularity of the franchise started with a piece of pie, the jokes and the gags never once did reinvent itself. Maybe it was meant to be that way. ""American Reunion"" brought the same things back to the table with slightly different twists, but still very little has changed since its inception back in 1999. If you've been following the theatrical releases of ""American Pie"" or even the direct-to-video spin-offs, you might enjoy this movie a lot. Because nothing new is to offer.",American Reunion
40,Sandcooler,Recaptures the magic (for the most part),8,21 October 2013,"""American Reunion"" is a very belated sequel, and I always tend to be weary of belated sequels. I mean, you always ask yourself the same question when projects like these come along: do the makers actually think they can add something, or do they just want to squeeze the last drop out of this franchise while there are still a couple of dozen people that remember the original? Obviously cinema is a business, so there's always a bit from column B, but column A definitely seems to outweigh it. Original writer Adam Herz isn't on board anymore, but the new guys treat the source material with a lot of respect and actually seem to get what it was about. It thrives a lot on gross-out and sex-related gags, but that's not ALL there is to it. These are actual characters, there is an actual coherent plot, that's what has always made ""American Pie"" stick out amongst its numerous copycats (the abysmal ""American Pie Presents""-movies are a prime example of doing it wrong). And much like the original, ""Reunion"" succeeds in a) making us laugh and b) touching a soft spot. Some of this stuff is actually pretty cheesy, but hell, the gang is back together damn it! A bit older, a bit less immature (Stifler has a job for God's sake), but they have still got each other's backs. While the disappointing ""Wedding"" seemed to close the franchise on kind of a downer, this one is definitely a more worthy conclusion. Way better than anyone could have expected.",American Reunion
41,moviexclusive,Everything you loved about the original Pie is still as delicious in this Reunion,7,5 April 2012,"Just when you think the 'American Pie' franchise has only enough life left for the direct-to-video market (where for the record, four titles under the 'American Pie Presents' banner have been released thus far), the original gang- including Jason Biggs, Chris Klein, Alyson Hannigan, Thomas Ian Nicholas, Eddie Kaye Thomas, Seann William Scott, Eugene Levy and Jennifer Coolidge- reunite for their third theatrical sequel to the 1999 original smash hit. That in itself is no small feat- though none of the cast members have become A-list stars in their own right, their statuses have risen considerably from the days of the first movie, so it does say something when all of them have returned to give their 'alma mater' another shot.And indeed, this reunion proves to be worth their while, as the 'Harold and Kumar' creators Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg have brought their considerable talent at raunchy comedy to the strict formula of the series with largely successful results. So even as Jim remains the hapless klutz and Stifler the vulgar and overbearing sex-crazed friend, the writing/ directing team of Hurwitz and Schlossberg manage to devise new gags built around the humour and style of the original- and if you liked the first 'American Pie', you'll probably lap this one up too as well.Directly following from the events of the last theatrical film 'American Wedding', Jim and Michelle Levenstein (Biggs and Hannigan) are now married with a two-year-old son, though that new addition to the family has taken its toll on their sex life. In the film's uproarious opening sequence (abbreviated as well in the trailer), husband and wife have resorted to self-gratification- Jim sneaks a jerk-off watching porn while Michelle is in the bathroom using the shower head to arouse herself- without the other's knowledge.The rest of the gang are similarly discontented at their existing lives- Oz (Klein) is a sports-caster with an embarrassing stint on a reality dance-show and a flirtatious girlfriend; Kevin (Ian Nicholas) is tired of the monotony of married life that revolves around watching too many 'Desperate Housewives' soaps with his wife; and Stifler (William Scott) is stuck in a crappy temp job ridiculed daily by his equally crude boss. When John Cho's 'MILF' character organises a high-school reunion, the quintet- including Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas)- drop their everyday lives and head back to their hometown of East Great Falls to relive their carefree high-school memories.Well aware that nostalgia would likely be this film's major selling point, Hurwitz and Schlossberg work hard at bringing back the memories, reminding audiences of the highlights of the first film- such as Jim's masturbatory hijinks from Shannon Elizabeth's Czech exchange student Nadia, and Finch's sexual encounter with Stifler's mother. That also means bringing back a whole host of previous characters- Kevin's ex Vicky (Tara Reid), Oz's former flame Heather (Mena Suvari), and of course Stifler's mother (Coolidge) as well as Jim's overenthusiastic dad (Levy)- in addition to cameos by the 'Sherminator' (Chris Owen) and Nadia herself.The trip down memory lane will be especially meaningful for middle-aged audiences who grew up watching the first three 'American Pie' movies, but those with little background to the prior films will still greatly enjoy the new characters. In particular, some of the film's most hilarious sequences come courtesy of these additions- a young and attractive next-door neighbour Kara (Ali Cobrin) whom Jim used to babysit; a nerd-turned-hottie Selena (Dania Ramirez) cast as Finch's love interest; and a trio of jocks Jim and his friends cross paths with, the leader Marco (Chuck Hittinger) of whom happens to be Kara's boyfriend and a only slightly less innocuous version of Stifler.Appropriately, every one of the original leads- with the notable exception of Stifler- have grown more mellowed, and the laughs here derive less from their juvenile pranks than a nonstop string of misadventures they find themselves in. It's a welcome- and perhaps inevitable-change from the previous films, but it's nice to know that you can still count on the occasional gross-out gag- the most memorable of which is undoubtedly the sight of Jim's dick squeezed underneath a pot lid. Instead of a go-for-broke mentality, the filmmakers opt for a more calculated approach to the gags, most of which therefore end up hitting the mark.Still, the fact that these characters have become more ruminative takes its toll on the pace of the movie, that unfolds at a less frenetic pace than you would expect from watching other recent genre offerings like the 'Harold and Kumar' movies or 'The Hangover'. It is also, at slightly under two hours, the longest 'American Pie', as Hurwitz and Schlossberg devote an almost equal amount of time and attention to each of the five lead character arcs within the movie. Yet there is a pleasing familiarity in watching the original cast reprise their distinctive roles, and fans are not likely to begrudge the longer running time.Whether there is still steam in the franchise for yet another big-screen return is nonetheless questionable, since this fourth entry doesn't quite re-invent the wheel than revisit it. There is after all only so much a series can ride on the nostalgic factor, and what goodwill fans have for it will likely run out if Hurwitz and Schlossberg aren't able to break with formula the next time round. For now, this reunion is still worth your while, and even if this Pie doesn't taste as fresh as it did 13 years ago, it is still comfort food you'll enjoy.www.moviexclusive.com",American Reunion
42,saadgkhan,"You know, you'll watch it...so Go Watch it!",5,11 July 2012,"American Reunion – CATCH IT (B-) The return of all original American Pie cast made American Reunion one of the most anticipated R-Rated comedies of the year. So does it live up to expectations I would say ""NO"". I think the major reason is the American Pie was an original thought and took the whole High school experience to next level. The American Reunion on the other hands took its inspiration from Adam Sandler's ""Grown Ups"" in the first half and in the 2nd half its all the same getting everyone back together with each other. Even though it's not as funny as I hoped for still American Pie brings all original cast back together and I think it's a nice way to see how everyone has gotten over the years. All regional cast Jason Biggs, Alyson Hannigan, Thomas Ian Nicholas, Chris Klein, Seann William Scott, Eddie Kaye Thomas, Tara Reid, Mena Suvari, Shannon Elizabeth, Eugene Levy , Jennifer Coolidge as Jeanine Stifler (aka ""Stifler's Mom""), John Cho and new cast Dania Ramirez, Ali Cobrin, Chuck Hittinger, Rebecca Fields, Jay Harrington and Katrina Bowden bring their humor in it. In the end, American Reunion is enjoyable but the concept is not new and indulging Grown Ups concept into it was a drag at least I expected something entirely new and hilarious.",American Reunion
43,Troy_Campbell,"Not overly fresh or witty, but enjoyable all the same.",6,4 April 2012,"Disregarding the countless straight-to-DVD duds that tenuously hailed themselves as ""sequels"", Reunion is the fourth instalment into the ultra-crude and hugely popular American Pie franchise. The cast are all 13 years older, but that adolescent giddiness they possessed back in 1999 when making the original (and by far the best) Pie thankfully hasn't been lost. It's a shame then that the material they're working with is half-baked. Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg's screenplay is lacklustre and derivative, relying on rehashed gags and goodwill toward the familiar characters to tickle the funny bone, rather than anything fresh or witty. Still, it's a major bonus to have basically everyone from the first movie return, including MILF guy #2 and the Sherminator, and veteran comedians Eugene Levy and Jennifer Coolidge are fantastic as Jim's Dad and Stifler's Mum (their end credits gag is the funniest of the film), so I couldn't help but watch this with a smile on my face.",American Reunion

There is a perfect balance of coarseness, lewdness and sentimentality and the story is wrapped up very nicely without ever becoming soppy.The story with Jim's family is actually really sad and as a result, we see Eugene Levy at his very best. Jason Biggs is brilliant as always and we finally see some character redemption for Stifler.

It was great having the entire cast come back for this film, I loved seeing all the familiar faces from the fist film with all their quirky personalities. The movie felt smooth and natural as the cast went on one last adventure for the Reunion. The jokes were amazing! Especially with Jim's Dad. They really used a new element of funny for this character which was amazing. The film did a great job with upping the sexual elements, bringing a wild ride of humour with it. It was nice that they brought out all the different kinds of midlife crisis that people have, it can make a person relate to the situations which brings the movie more to a down to earth, place.

53,LoneWolfAndCub,A fitting end to a series that defined my generation,7,5 April 2012,"I remember not being allowed to see American Pie when I had just turned 13 as my parents deemed it too raunchy. Being the young rebel I was I found a way to see it anyway. To this day it, and the two true sequels, remain some of favourite comedies. Sure, the American Pie 2 and American Pie: Wedding weren't as good as the first, but they all provided copious amounts of good-spirited yet raunchy and filthy laughs with characters you really liked. After a slew of shockingly bad direct-to-video sequels I was extremely excited to see the gang return for one final film in American Reunion. These are characters that have been gone from the screen far too long if you ask me, and their return, although not as good as the first, is still a hilarious trip down memory lane.It's been awhile since the gang have been together, 13 years to be exact, which is the year their high school reunion takes place. Jim (Jason Biggs) is married to Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) with a son, Oz (Chris Klein) is a sports news reporter and engaged to model Mia (Katrina Bowden), Finch has dropped off the radar (Eddie Kaye Thomas), Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) is married and an architect and Stifler (Seann William Scott) is a PA at a big firm. When they meet up for their reunion, they are once again up to their old shenanigans.Writers Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg stick to the same formula which made the others so successful, and it worked. The situations these guys get themselves into are weaved into the story well, nothing seems forced. All the actors do a fantastic job of bringing these characters back to their old selves, it's like they were born to play these roles. Obviously the movie is somewhat predictable, with certain characters ending up with another person. By the end, American Reunion has come full circle, and for the people who grew up with American Pie as a teenager it is nice to see it wrapped up as well as it has been.3½/5",American Reunion
54,davidgee,Still crazy - and gross - after all these years,7,17 May 2012,"Let's be honest about this, guys: we are expecting - and we get - some extremely gross behaviour! Taking a dump (was American Pie the ground- breaker in this?) is to US comedy what farting is to Brit-coms, and REUNION duly delivers in this yucky area. Jim gets a hysterical kitchen scene, though perhaps not as funny as the one that involved his mom's apple pie in 1999. There are a number of sexual mishaps, though nothing quite as 'outstanding' (if that's the word) as the beer-glass episode 13 years ago. Stifler's Mom and Jim's Dad are still in town and get a good slice of screen time.The years have been kinder to Stifler (Seann William Scott) and Oz (Chris Klein) than to the other guys, and most of the high-school girls still look smoking hot). Despite the moments of gross humour REUNION comes close to being a rom-com. Jim and Michelle's marital problems, Oz and Finch and Kevin's quest for love, Stifler's desperate need of friendship: these elements add depth to the storyline and are handled with a degree of sensitivity.After the tawdriness of the previous sequels, this a well-scripted, solidly played return to the form of the first movie.

55,cultfilmfreaksdotcom,So So,6,10 April 2012,"American REUNION can make a forty-something feel pretty damn old. The original classic was homage to the sex comedies of the 1980s, a celebration of an era long past, and now the '90s are nostalgic. Plot centers on the obvious but this has little to do with the reunion itself.Unlike the sequels, the whole gang's back this time. Jim's still married to Michelle with a baby boy and both seek their own form of – let's call it personal pleasure. Their sex life has hit the skids while the overly nice and now bearded Kevin's marriage is just fine, except when Vicky's around. Oz is a semi famous sportscaster who did a reality TV dance more embarrassing than Jim's viral video, and his old flame Heather's got a successful doctor as a boyfriend. Sleepy-eyed Finch claims to be an adventurous journeyman while the fan favorite, Stifler, despite working an office job still loves to party. And he wants his grownup buddies to return to their old ways, first at a lake replete with high school chicks – including a sexpot Jim once babysat who wants him worse than he wanted pie – and then at his house party where Jim's dad hooks up with Stifler's mother.And with the running around not much really happens. The jokes are either dull or overboard (keeping up with the Apatow), and most of the characters seem like sticks in the mud (i.e. adults) except Stifler who, reveling as the scene-stealing jester, eventually has to grow up. Shannon Elizabeth, Natasha Lyonne and ""The Shermanator"" provide unnecessary cameos. And while there's a relaxing quality seeing all the kids back together, they need something to lose – like the first time around.

Finch who has since American Pie 1 been going to bed with Stifler's mum.In 1999 it began with losing virginity and the raping of a pie, to a weird weekend getaway down to the marriage between Jim and Michelle, and Stifler plans to milk a lady going moo – moo. With all this in the past we now see them in a different light. American Pie 1 was the best no doubt about that, American Pie 3 (American Wedding) to me was far better than two, but this new American Pie (Reunion) is better than two but not three.The original cast all reprise their roles, giving us the same deal as the first three nothing new:Masturbation (check): in fact the first scene has it occurring twice Jim watching porn (check): that has been a stalemate in all American Pie Stif-mister (check): not growing up at all he is still obnoxious and out of his senses defecating in some teenagers drink cooler Sex (check) and nudity (check).Nothing much can be said about the movie's plot without dropping spoilers, just that all our characters have grown some married, and Jim and Michelle had a two year old son.Well if you are looking for a good story line, know that American Pie has never tried to offer any neither has the acting been extra-ordinary as most cast behaved like over grown kids. The directing not exceptional as the movie is juvenile and the plot just over the roof ridicules. But hey! What were you expecting? It is American Pie.One thing though, if you are in the mood for some juvenile high school kind of movie, 21 jump street is a good movie for you, because that too had grown ups behaving like misplaced juvenile youths.If you are a fan of the older versions then this can slip under the rug as a movie you may like.All in all, (heavy sigh) not really much to say just I have seen it do you want to?",American Reunion
58,ronbell-23984,Should have not bothered,5,15 September 2021,"I really think they should have left it alone after the first 3 movies, I enjoyed those movies lotsThis movie didn't work for me.

59,asc85,A pleasant surprise,7,20 August 2012,"I'm not a huge fan of the American Pie series, but I have enjoyed them, and wanted to see the reunion, especially since just about everybody (if not everybody) came back for this one. When I saw mostly bad reviews of this, I was disappointed, but I still wanted to see it. I figured it would be like ""Scream 4,"" in the sense that it was living on the reputation of the previous movies. It wouldn't be good, but like Scream 4, I liked the previous movies enough to see this one anyway.This film certainly won't be on many ""Best 10"" lists at the end of the year, but I was glad I saw it. Of course you have to like the raunchy humor (and there's still a good amount of that), but the film was surprisingly sweet in some areas, particularly when we find out that the still-smoking-hot Nadia/Shannon Elizabeth ends up with a geek just like Jim/Jason Biggs, which shows to me that however hard-to-believe it is, that she truly liked the geeky Jim character in the earlier movies.American Reunion wasn't as good as the first movie, but I'd say it's definitely better than #2. I liked American Wedding as well (although when I saw it again, I don't think it aged very well), so I'd put this one at about the same level.My only criticism was that the Stifler character was a little bit too over-the-top in this one. It's supposed to be a 13 year reunion (again, never happens, but they wanted it to be faithful to the original release year of 1999), and that would make him over 30. I'm not sure anyone acts that juvenile at that age. Other than that, I was pleasantly surprised how much I liked it. I don't think you can do another one of these American Pie films, and they probably shouldn't, because it finished on about as high a quality level as a film series like this can.",American Reunion
60,jimmycoffin-751-212853,American pie always works,10,28 October 2020,"American pie (originals) have a high standard. There's really no other movies in the same genre since the 80s that can compete. Every sandler, ferrell, the rock etc movie is absolute socialmedia trash in comparison.
And its weird that so many crappy cringy comedies gets a higher score then american pie. The acting is so much more down to earth played. humor works because the actors are all friends. It has the hottest babes, the best nostalgic settings, the movies are also warm. And its not just 2 hours of crude jokes. I still watch american pie If its on tv.
It just works, while other buddy movies just doesn't.",American Reunion
61,nickmesafilms,American Reunion (2012) - The Party is Back! (My 200th Review Ever Made),7,14 April 2012,"Like they say, at the end of a movie series, they always keep the best piece for last. With ""American Pie"", they literally mean the best piece...of pie....for last. Wow, another stupid pun! What's next? Now, I never saw the other American Pie movies, frankly because I didn't have the time or ability to tune in watching them. But I'll check them out sometime. After seeing ""American Reunion"", I get the idea that this is the final movie of the series, and how everything wraps up perfectly, and how this movie makes the previous movies nostalgic. Literally, everybody from the previous movies has returned. Everyone is back. From Jason Biggs, Alyson Hannigan, Thomas Ian Nicholas, Chris Klein, Seann William Scott, Eddie Kay Thomas, Mena Suvari, John Cho, Jennifer Coolidge, and Eugene Levy. They are all back for their high school reunion. I walked into this movie with a few beliefs and doubts, but I walked out impressed, and filled with laughter. This movie kept going and going with hilarious gags, and chuckle-worthy mishaps. Jason Biggs knew what he was trying to do in this movie, while Seann William Scott was trying to be both funny and annoying at the same time. But I think that the best laugh-out-loud moments came from Eugene Levy, as Jason Biggs' dad. He steals the whole movie, and he delivers the best lines of the movie. Since watching this movie, I was disappointed that we saw Eugene Levy for a limited number of times in the movie, and I wanted to see more of him. I'm just glad that his scenes were funny. There were some moments when I nearly chuckled, cringed, or hardly laughed at all. Some of the jokes fell flat, and some of the scenes went too far. But I also loved the soundtrack, filled with songs that I have listened as a child, and songs that I listen to, today. Yes, these weren't Oscar-worthy performances, but the cast was trying to be honest on the characters they portrayed. Although I never saw the other movies, I kind of respected these characters, and I was on their side throughout. Great laughs, great jams, and great characters make this movie good. Also, the writing is sharp, and it contains a special message paying a ""kiss goodbye"" to the adventures of the American pie movies. Although there were movies I enjoyed more this year, this movie didn't disappoint. It carries a special and undamaged tribute to the original movies. This is a fun, and entertaining piece of memorabilia that will be hilarious and entertaining for all fans of the American Pie movies, and for the ones who never saw the previous American Pie movies. ""American Reunion"", in my review, ""a fun and entertaining reunion, and hilariously deserving"".",American Reunion

63,Donatien3,An enjoyable nostalgia trip,8,15 April 2012,"It's been a long time between drinks for the American Pie gang, with the last movie back in 2003 (not counting the handful of straight-to-DVD 'American Pie presents' films) and the Pie's brand of gross-out humour being replaced by the crude-yet-sweet comedy of 'The 40-Year-Old- Virgin', 'Superbad', 'Knocked Up', 'Role Models' etc.While a fourth American Pie movie may seem like a cynical cash grab for nostalgic audiences, it manages to be an entertaining film in its own right, with a lot of the gross-out humour that made the original films so successful.In the new movie, a lot of the main cast has grown up and moved on: Jim (Jason Biggs) and Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) have been married for a decade and have a young boy, Oz (Chris Klein) has a glamorous lifestyle in LA as a sports presenter and minor celebrity with a hot girlfriend ('30 Rock's' Kirsten Bowden), Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) is a devoted house husband and Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) is supposedly a mysterious and exotic traveller. The only one who hasn't grown up is Stifler (Sean William Scott) who is struggling to let go of his high school memories and continues to act like a teenager.They all come together for the class of 1999 reunion, and old feelings resurface between Oz and Heather (Mena Suvari) and Kevin and Vicky (Tara Reid). Adding to that is Jim's attempt to rekindle the spark with Michelle, which has hit a flat point, as well as trying to get his dad (Eugene Levy) back on the dating scene.The film is driven by a number of gross-out set pieces which feel reminiscent of the original movies and will please old fans.While Stifler's immature antics are the highlight, it's Levy who provides plenty of the laughs. As well as starring the original three films, Levy was also in the spin-offs, so it wouldn't feel like an American Pie movie without him, providing the voice of wisdom and reason as well as a developing relationship with Stifler's Mum (Jennifer Coolidge), that culminates in a funny credits sequence.If nothing else 'Reunion' is an enjoyable nostalgia trip. The film does enough to remind you why the series was so successful in its prime (with many original minor characters reappearing) without seeming like a pointless retread.",American Reunion
64,Chris_Pandolfi,Serving Up Another Slice of Life,7,6 April 2012,"What I appreciate about the ""American Pie"" films is that, beneath the raunchiness and juvenile slapstick humor, there rests a kernel of truth. ""American Reunion"" continues in that tradition. Although it utilizes the kind of crude sexual humor that I don't find particularly funny, there is evident a compelling examination of friendship, love, and the general ups and downs of relationships at an adult life stage. In this case, that would be thirteen years after graduating high school; this is the point in time at which we find Jim Levenstein (Jason Biggs), Kevin Myers (Thomas Ian Nicholas), Chris ""Oz"" Ostreicher (Chris Klein), Paul Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas), and Steve Stifler (Seann William Scott). Now around thirty, they each have their own lives and have had their fair share of success and failure.Jim and his wife, Michelle (Alyson Hannigan), now have a two-year-old son named Evan, which is in large part why they have fallen into a sexual rut. Kevin is now a work-from-home architect and is happily married to a woman named Ellie (Charlene Amoia). After moving to Los Angeles and competing in a celebrity dance show (which he's now deeply embarrassed by), Oz has become an NFL sports announcer. He lives with his girlfriend, a supermodel and wild party girl named Mia (Katrina Bowden). Stifler, still an obnoxious and vulgar sex maniac, now works as a temp at an investment firm, where he undergoes daily abuse from his boss (Vik Sahay). Finch, after a period in which he went missing, suddenly returns on a motorcycle. He has not yet found the love of his life, but according to what he tells his friends, he has extensively travelled the world.The entire gang comes back together when it's announced that a thirteen-year high school reunion would take place in their home town. Jim reunites with his father (Eugene Levy), who's eager to get back into the dating scene following the death of his wife three years earlier. Oz reunites with his former high school sweetheart, Heather (Mena Suvari), who's now dating a cardiologist named Ron (Jay Harrington). It immediately becomes apparent that Oz has more in common with Heather – and likewise, Ron with Mia. Kevin reunites with his old flame, Vicky (Tara Reid), and it seems that old feelings begin to resurface. Finch finds himself attracted to Michelle's former band mate, a bartender named Selena (Dania Ramirez), who since her homely high school days has blossomed into a beautiful woman. For obvious reasons, the guys decide not to invite Stifler. But you know how it is with twists of fate; he just happens to see them hanging out at a bar, everyone has a few shots, and the next thing you know, he's tagging along.Jim, who still has an eye for hot teenage girls, is unwittingly reintroduced to Kara (Ali Corbin), the girl he used to babysit. Now on the verge of turning eighteen, she's certainly easy on the eyes. Initially, she flirts with him coyly. But on the night of her birthday, she gets drunk out of her mind; this paves the way for a series of comedic misadventures that make Jim look a lot guiltier than he actually is. Kara's jealous and immature boyfriend, A.J. (Chuck Hittinger), will have a few well-placed antagonistic run-ins with Jim and his friends. It culminates with a party at the home of Stifler's mom (Jennifer Coolidge), where just about everything goes wrong. Surprisingly, it goes well for Jim's dad, who reluctantly joins in. After getting certifiably drunk, he meets Stifler's mom and has ... well, let's just say that he has a lot of fun. The two have a lot in common, not the least of which is having walked in on their children during a sexual encounter.While I generally don't laugh at something as juvenile as defecating into a cooler filled with beer bottles, or hurriedly slamming down a laptop onto an erection, causing it to bleed, it's obvious to me that underneath is a story that has something to say about people. There's a moment, for example, when the guys observe the adolescent antics of the high schoolers partying at a lake; Kevin wonders aloud if they were ever as annoying back when they were in high school, and Finch responds that their generation was more mature. Naturally, Stifler is the exception. Indeed, there was a time when we would look at him and think he wouldn't grow up. Now that he has entered his thirties, it's looking more and more like he truly can't grow up. You know what the difference is.Everything ends pretty much as we expect it to end, which in this case isn't a criticism so much as a simple observation. Sometimes, it's nice when a screenplay is formatted like a sitcom, even if it happens to be a really, really raunchy one. For me, the appeal of ""American Reunion"" has less to do with vulgar lines and sight gags and more to do with character development and theme. The first three films were fairly narrow in scope, their plots built on foundations as solid yet limited as losing your virginity, finding that special someone, and making a commitment to marriage. This new film is much broader, addressing the very relatable notion of settling down and living the rest of your life. The message, it seems, is that you can get through anything so long as you have friends at your side.-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)",American Reunion
65,NightmareOnElmStreetFan,One of the best comedy's of 2000's the gang returns for some of the funniest times yet,10,12 September 2019,"What can I say? This is really one of my favorite comedy's of 2000's. It is one of the best movies of 2000's all the gang returns from the first two movies. Yes American Reunion is the fourth installment in the American Pie franchise. It is my number 1 personal favorite American Pie film in the franchise. It is an awesome movie with awesome dialogue, very funny scenes, especially the taking a dump in the beer scene.I love this movie to death all the characters from the first two movies return and are hillarious. Stifler (Seann William Scott) is one of my favorite characters in the franchise of all time. Jim Levenstein (Jason Biggs) was excellent but I think in American Pie 2 he was much better. Jim Levenstein was always my favorite character, Steve Stiffler is my second favorite character. Chris Klein as Chris ""Oz"" Ostreicher was too me MILES way better than he was in the first movie. He was also in comedy Say It Isn't So with Heather Graham. Kevin Myers (Thomas Ian Nicholas) was a good heart man with a beard and he is likeable guy I like him. Eddie Kaye Thomas as Paul Finch was likeable I love the guy so much he was awesome. Than we have other characters returning like Jessica (Natasha Lyonne) she only had one cameo role, she was a lesbian in this movie but still suprisingly good. Vicky Lathum as Tara Reid was also likeable she was beautiful and really sweet as Vicky. Tara Reid was a gorgeous babe too bad she is not my sexy girlfriend. I love the actress to death Tara I love you, your biggest fan. Eugene Levy as Noah Levensteine as Jim's dad is the regular member who appeared in all 8 movies.There were spin off movies: (Band Camp, The Naked Mile, Beta House and The Book of Love) and Noah Levensteine appeared in all these movies. The film also shows adults, high school was awesome and the coolest place. I am an adult not a high schooler anymore, my life as high schooler was exciting and awesome, but studyng was hard. Adult life is hard real world, that's what this movie shows. The writing in this movie is awesome, it is about friends, sex and lost love.Alyson Hannigan as Michelle returns in this movie as Jim's wife, adorable sexy Jennifer Coolidge as MILF Stiffler's mom also returns. Chuck Sherman The Sherminator who absolutely adores, idolizes and loves Terminator 2: Judgment Day is also here. Chris Owen was only regular as Sherminator in the first two movies, Band Camp and this one.I miss this kind of films to day, the plot is about reunion from the first film 1999 20 years ago now and that was also my first film I saw in high school. I still have the VHS tape home of the first American Pie movie. East Great Falls returns for their 10 year old high-school reunion the gang now adults are experience a weekend they will never forget. Couples like Jim and Michelle get serious and tie the knot. Oz and Heather went their seperate ways. Paul Finch still looks with lust at the perfect evning, he spent with Stifler's mom.Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg both perfectly directed nad shows this film, it is rated - R it has nudity and sex which I like. American Reunion does not hold anything back and I'm glad this movie finally got made, it really did give us fans closure that was much needed.",American Reunion
66,eshwarmail,A nice little funny romp makes it even better because of its familiarity,6,4 November 2012,"Can't remember the last time I saw an American Pie movie but guess what, I never forgot any of those characters. So in some ways it felt pretty good watching them all come back well out of their high school setup. American Pie started out during the dawn of Internet and made the best use of the technology for its one joke wonder, same cannot be said for what followed. But sure kept up the raunchiness and over-the-top gags by their well established characters.Jim (Jason Biggs) and Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) are still married and have a son. Oz (Chris Klein) is dating a lingerie model, Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) is still mysterious about what he does and Stifler (Seann William Scott) is still Stifler. They all come back to their hometown for the reunion and see things with the teenagers now has gone well out of their reach. Rest is how they deal with ex-sweethearts, how they deal with their estranged friendship and Stifler's mom.If not for the lengthy gap, it all feels too familiar in its setup. It can be both a good and a bad thing. The energy is still there and as long as Stifler is around, one wouldn't know what he will be up to. It does have its funny moments and the rest of the cast does fit in quite well since none seemed to have fallen out of their image in the following career endeavors. It is tightly packed with a decent runtime and does not get too preachy though at times brings itself to such situations. There is this nice little dilemma going on whether they are mature enough or still the same silly goofs they were which is well portrayed during the scenes with drunk teen girl whom Jim once babysat or stealing her boyfriend's water ski etc.A nice little funny romp makes it even better because of its familiarity.",American Reunion
67,dallasryan,Freakin Great!,9,28 February 2014,"The first American Pie was Jason Biggs' and Chris Klein's movie, the 2nd one was all 4 of theirs with Scott as Stifler starting to take command, the 3rd one was Stifler's movie, and this 4th one started looking like it was going to be Stifler's movie again but then it became all 4 of the characters movie once again, and that was a pleasant surprise. You start caring for all the characters and have great laughs with all the characters which made for a much funnier movie.American Wedding is still my favorite but this American Reunion is a close 2nd. Plus this one includes Eugene Levy into the thick of things even more which makes it even more hilarious. That ending is laugh out loud to die for. So funny.Overall, the situations the character's are in is what makes them funny. The only three that really ever have a character that you really like and care for are Stifler, Eugene Levy, and Chris Klein in some ways. They're the only ones that really have developed some great characterization to where you like who they are.Biggs' character Jim is funny because of the situations he always gets himself into. But as a person, Jim is kind of boring really. And so are the rest of them. But nonetheless, American Reunion will give you a much needed laugh, and it's even funnier if you watch it with someone who likes the same kind of movies you do. A must see!",American Reunion

The original Pie movie dated from a time when there where no cell phones and the internet was a newer technology. The makers clevery weave in all the guys and girls from the original films and the story is as well written as it could be. If you liked American Pie then I certainly would recommend this film.

71,ghost_dog86,Tara Reid has not aged well.,3,18 April 2012,"Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I. Ashland Have you ever wondered why none of the main characters from the original ""American Pie"" (except for Seann William Scott) have made a successful movie in years? Well wonder no more. Co-written and directed by Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg (yeah, that's right. The Harold & Kumar writers) and starring the old gang: Jason Biggs, Alyson Hannigan, Chris Klein, Thomas Ian Nicholas, Tara Reid, Seann William Scott, Mena Suvari, Eddie Kay Thomas, Natasha Lyonne, Shannon Elizabeth and Chris Own (and I realize that if you are under 20, then you have no clue who any of these people are), ""American Reunion"" is sequel-centric Hollywood's feeble attempt to revive a dead (straight to video) franchise. And Jason Biggs full frontal nudity doesn't help.Side Note: I realize Alyson Hannigan co-stars on ""How I Met Your Mother"" and some would say that she has a thriving career. But that show sucks, so it doesn't really count.Synopsis: This routine reunion storyline sees the original ""American Pie"" crew back together again for their 13 year reunion. Yeah, that makes perfect sense. But when all of the ""domesticated"" guys come back to town, they find that all of the teenage girls there have grown into raging nymphets. Oh, how will they ever survive the weekend? And that's it. That's the entire premise. Everything you would think that would happen on a hokey, primetime television reunion show, happens here but in a rated R format; which means: nudity and mean spirited homophobic jokes galore. Suffice to say, ""American Reunion"" is nothing more than cheaply written bromance trash, with two watchable performances from Seann William Scott as Stifler and Eugene Levy as Jim's Dad. In fact, let's make this simple. Scott and Levy are the only reasons to watch this mediocre (at best) film. And I really believe that Scott's performance was only tolerable here because the raunchy Stifler character he plays is such comic gold. So much so that a film starring said Stifler character would have been substantially more entertaining than anything ""American Reunion"" had to offer. Everybody else in this movie is forgettable, offensively bland and just down-right horrific actors; especially Biggs.The worst part of ""American Reunion"" is how the entire atmosphere of it is misogynistic at its core. The pitiful writing here works on the comic level of 12 year old boys, with a formula that has one character tell a joke about how all women are sluts, followed by a gay joke, and then another character repeating the formula, and so on and so forth for 90+ minutes. The fact that this method doesn't seem to work during the first 10 minutes of ""American Reunion"", doesn't seem to deter Hurwitz or Schlossberg. But I guess ignoring how offensively juvenile your jokes are before making a comedy is always the sign of good filmmakers.Final Thought: OK time to be painfully truthful. There are some funny moments here, mainly from Scott and Levy, but these moments are very (VERY) few and far between. And definitely not worth paying theater prices to see; no matter how big of an ""American Pie"" fan you are.

72,gregeichelberger,A meandering 'Reunion',4,5 April 2012,"As wrap-up films for movie franchises go, one just has to look back at the Harry Potter empire to see how to do it right. ""American Reunion"" director Jon Hurwitz (""Harold and Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay"") was obviously not very observant.Born in 1999, ""American Pie,"" conceived by Adam Herz and starring a group of newcomers (including Jason Biggs, Sean William Scott, Chris Klein, Thomas Ian Nicholas, Eddie Kaye Thomas, Alyson Hannigan, Natasha Lyonne and Tara Reid, as well as Mena Survari — who had made a big splash in ""American Beauty"" the year before), burst onto the scene and ushered in a wave of raunchy but hilarious ""R"" rated comedies.As usual, though, the movie also spawned several unimpressive sequels, and was thought to have run its course after the dismal 2003 effort, ""American Wedding,"" as well as a series of terrible straight-to-DVD duds. Twelve years later, however, the idea of a reunion concept is introduced and everyone returns to Great Falls, Mich. for the finale.The original gang, Jim Levenstein (Biggs), Kevin Myers (Nicholas), Paul Finch (Thomas), Chris ""Oz"" Ostreicher (Klein) and Steve Stifler (Scott, who was more of a nemesis in earlier pictures) has graduated from high school and has gone on to various occupations and relationship situations.Jim has finally married Michelle (Hannigan, ""How I Met Your Mother"" TV series), while Kevin has hooked up with Jessica (Lyonne, ""The New Girl"" TV series), Oz is a superstar sportscaster involved with party girl model Mia (Katrina Bowden, ""30 Rock"" TV series), Finch returns from a series of ""adventures"" and Stifler is a temp working for a large corporation.Familiar faces soon show up (making fans of the series chuckle with recognition and astonishment at what more than a decade will do to some people's appearance), including Vikcy Lathum (Reid), Heather (Suvari) and Chuck Sherman (Chris Owen), among others. The two most recognized, however, are of an older generation, Mrs. Stifler (Jennifer Coolidge, ""Waiting For Guffman,"" ""Best Of Show"") and Mr. Levenstein (Eugene Levi, ""Best Of Show,"" ""A Mighty Wind"" and an original member of the ""SCTV"" troupe).And while we're supposed to be concerned that Jim and Michelle are not having sex as often as they should; or that Oz and Mia are not getting along; or that Vicky seems to be coming on to Kevin; or that Finch may not be exactly what he seems; or that Stifler is not happy with his job, eventually the film comes down to its original, raunchier elements.Yes, there are scenes that will literally make you turn away in embarrassment or gag in contempt; and the plot involving an 18-year-old girl that Jim once baby sat coming on to him is decidedly creepy — and not funny in the least. And, of course, since there HAS to be one in every movie these days, an awkward gay subplot is introduced.The only saving grace (and that term is used very loosely) is the inclusion of Coolidge and Levi, but their brief scene together peters out and ends all to quickly for much comedic satisfaction. Levi's early scenes with his son, though, do work and illicit the only real laughs from this production.Thus, with the pat conclusion and tying up of the series' many loose ends, the ""American Pie"" franchise has come full circle. The problem is that the circle is not very funny or even interesting enough to care about.",American Reunion
73,carlos37andre,The American Pie franchise is great,8,20 July 2020,"Last month, I've started re-watching the whole American Pie movies in chronological order (yes, I did watch the spin-offs again), and my God, I was truly surprised, by how funny the whole all the movies still are. American Pie, American Pie 2, American Wedding, and American Reunion form, imo, one of the best comedy movie series ever. All the four movies are funny as hell even now, we learn to love, and we oddly grow with the characters, and well, it's just a lot of fun. I have to talk specifically about American Reunion here tho, so let's go.The fact that, even tho the movie doesn't have a director that had directed an American Pie movie before, or either the writer of the first three films (Adam Herz), and even still it manages to capture the fun, and the soul of the first films perfectly. It has our weird sexual moments with Jim (but this time around he's a father, so... father issues!), it has some heartfelt moments, that I truly think people who grew up seen the films, related too (cause, you know, you kind of grows up with the characters over the years too). The movie is, in its weird way, about growing old, and that feeling of nostalgia towards your teenage years.Anyways, almost everyone is great here, Jason Biggs kills it, this is truly the role he was meant to play all along. Also, a side note, I love how he managed to mimic Eugene Levy in some scenes, where he's actually the grown up, having to help others, and he nails it, like father like son, right? Alyson Hannigan is great, Seann William Scott rocks, and I love the fact we got to see Oz back this time around, since he wasn't part of the third film (they even quickly mentioned it).Just another side note tho, I always just thinking about, and it's funny how I had a way different memory of these movies in general, seen them as a teen, the impression was that there was truly a lot more nudity involved in all the movies as there actually is. Talking only about the main movie that is, the spin offs sure have a love more nudity, and the fact there aren't nearly as good as any one of the four main films, surely shows that the movies stuck in a lot of fans' heads until now, because they were actually... funny, and in a weird way relatable, not just cause of out of nowhere nudity, and sex jokes (cause again, that's mostly all the spin offs are about, and they are mostly... bad).Long story short, the movie is great, the revisiting of these characters almost 10 years later probably couldn't have been much better. If that's really the last time we seen those guys (which probably is), they went out in a high note. These four movies will always have a special place in my heart when regarding comedies.Just to finish up, I'm gonna list a few scenes I loved: Ochocinco is in the movie! The scene in the kitchen, where we end up seen more of Jim that we wanted too is funny, but Michelle's line ""he's the father of my child"" is priceless; The ""be her daddy"" line Stifler says to Jim might be one of the best puns Stifler says in the entire series; The ""I'm your dick"" pun is great also; I love the opening scene with Michelle and Jim both having weird sex experiences; Stifler having sex with Finch's mom is also such a great way to wrap up these characters storyline; I love the ending with them all eating breakfast together, and I also LOVE the mid-credit scene in the movie theater with... my God! Eugene Levy is the best thing about this whole franchise (almost all scenes he shares with Jason Biggs are great by the way, the scene when they start talking about their sex lives... and the other one, ""you dad... there are services"" lol); And, of course, talking about the man, my favorite scene in the entire movie, is the him jumping of a window high as hell, running away screaming he ""wasn't there"" lol, I laughed out loud, Jim's dad is the best.",American Reunion
74,paudie,Not really necessary,6,11 July 2012,"The first American Pie movie was a very original movie. It's originality lay in its unashamed poor taste and crude jokes. Viewers couldn't help laugh as age old toilet jokes became the plot to a mainstream movie - and it was funny. The second movie was more of the same but not as funny.So not surprisingly ""American Pie:Reunion"" doesn't say anything new. The old gang get together for their High School reunion and the lads are determined to act as though are in High School even though they now have adult responsibilities. There are a few laughs but not that many and most of actors find it hard not to show that their hearts really aren't in it.",American Reunion
75,GirishGowda,"Funny, Heartwarming and Nostalgic",7,20 August 2013,"The original gang returns to Great East Falls thirteen years (yes, even Nadia is back in a cameo!) since John organizes a Class of 1999 reunion. Jim and Michelle have a little son, Oz is a semi-celebrity who has a supermodel for a girlfriend, Kevin is a stay at home husband, while Finch is living it up by travelling all over the world. Heather, a cardiologist, has settled down with a douche who masks himself as a good guy and Vicky, uh we don't really know what she's been upto. All of the characters are grown up and there are many different facets to them other than always being horny and on the hunt for sex, except for Stifler of course. He's still the same old dipsh*t living under his mother's roof, but now working under a Mr. Doraiswamy (Vik Sahay).I was not even a teen when the original trilogy came out. So, I watched them in a marathon when I was around 14-15. I love the first three Pie movies, but don't really care for the rest of them. This movie was definitely a pleasant surprise. Who knew Hollywood could get a comedy sequel right! Don't misunderstand me. There isn't much that's innovative or brilliant in this Reunion. The crude jokes, though hilarious and gross at times, are tame compared to the original movies. The nudity is also way low from before and it feels almost tasteful (in the way that these sex comedies can be tasteful). Speaking of nudity, Kara (Ali Cobrin) is just gorgeous and the female characters still don't have much to do in this. But hey men are as objectified as females (that ass flex will haunt you forever). So, there's that.There are a few flaws, the most important among them is totally forgetting about their baby by the end. This movie highlights how dumb it is to run after outer beauty, learning to trust your friends, doing the right thing among other stuff and its all clichéd, but just so well done. Its heartfelt and captured the essence of the Pie movies wonderfully. The ace up the makers sleeves is the return of the complete cast. This one will definitely make fans who grew up with the original Pie nostalgic.7/10",American Reunion
76,loco_73,What... no frakking baked goods in this one?!,6,20 April 2012,"""American Reunion"" is a worthy addition, and sequel of sorts, and hopefully an ending, to a movie franchise which has spawned three previous ""official"" entries, each less-funny than the first, and a few direct-to-DVD (Can we still say that? Or is it direct-to-Blue-ray or OnDemand now?) bastard cousins, which were in retrospect quite awful.The movie does not bring anything new to the table, it follows the same formula which made the first movie, what could now be considered, a classic teen/pre-adult comedy, a formula which eventually started eroding and finally damaged the sequels.Strange as it seems, this movie works largely based on a serious dose of nostalgia. I was in my second year at college when the first movie came out, so seeing these characters (I'm the same age as some of them...oh boy...I'm getting old!!!!) brought back some good and not so good memories of the intervening years.The laughs are still there, albeit intermittently, the cast is largely intact, in spite of Chris Klein's, Tara Reid's (actually Reid looked better cleaned-up) and Natasha Lyonne's well documented public ""disasters"". Everybody puts in an appearance, even if literally for a few seconds. As weird as it might sound, the way the actors look and by extension the characters, is in sync with what you might have expected of them.""American Reunion"" is a so-so movie, sans the pie f **king, with some laughs and some moments of reminiscence sprinkled through. Luckily there is enough of those to prevent it from being an unnecessary wreck. I sincerely hope this is the ABSOLUTE LAST entry in this franchise!",American Reunion
77,Fields201,Stifler is my hero,8,14 April 2012,"It's been a while since I've been to the movies but I wasn't going to miss out on seeing American Reunion. Honestly, the first half hour was pretty bland but then it got hilarious after that.American Reunion is the fourth installment in the American Pie saga and no I am not counting those DVD spin-offs. Why they made those is anyone's guess. What's great about this one is that they got everyone back from the American Pie movies, regardless of how pointless they were in the script. Tara Reid, I'm looking at you.It's almost like revisiting old friends and seeing how they look after all these years. Mena Suvari still looks hot and Tara Reid looks as slutty as ever. Oz (Chris Klein) is back and I really don't know why he didn't reprise his role in the last installment. Of course, the movie wouldn't be complete without Stifler and he steals every scene.There was a lot of hilarious moments and it even follows the formula of the first film and puts a spin on it. There are some things in the script that is questionable: like how Michelle could forgive Jim so easily in one scene without any explanation. But hey, it's a fun movie and I laughed and that's all I came in for. It did its job.",American Reunion

The reunion itself plays a small role, as we spend the majority of the film seeing the old chaps getting reacquainted and touching base with the past.Unfortunately, this being ""American Pie,"" there is a bit too much schmalz and touchy feely vibes to it. I mean, heck, even the comedy itself is really your typical degenerate American style toilet humor. But Seann William Scott and Jason Biggs deliver as usual.Only for fans.",American Reunion
81,troy-manatunga,atmosphere of the first movie wrapping us viewers in an American PIE enchantment.,7,2 May 2012,"I have been a fan of the trilogy since the first movie back in 1999. American PIE is a trend setter for all high school comedy movies that discuss matters of adolescents in high school. For fans of the trilogy this is a massive comeback and is largely welcome after 9 years. The teaser campaign came as a surprise and now it is finally here. It is safe to say American REUNION lives up to the trilogy that wrapped up in 2003. Many installments have been named after the trilogy with most of them carrying on the Levenstine and Stiffler names into them. Hardcore fans of the trilogy will agree with me. This isn't the 9th or 10th installment of American PIE, this dear readers is the 4th! The wannabe attempts are greatly appreciated and some of them are actually quite funny. However if there is no Jim, Michelle, Finch, Stiffler, Oz and Kevin it truly can never be American PIE.Jason Biggs, Sean William Scott, Alyson Hannigan, Thomas Ian Nicholas, Eddie Kaye Thomas and Chris Klein (who missed out the wedding in 2003) are back. All grown up; so they think! High school reunions do something to us all! Would you not agree? It is like a day or two where you become the boy/girl who you once were, who used to aspire to be the person you are now. Taking a break from the rat race of life is always welcome. When this crew takes a break they attract trouble like a moth that finds the flame.Jim and Michelle have a son who is 2 years old, while Kevin too is married and is a stay at home husband who is also an architect. Oz has his own sports show and is considered a celebrity in certain circles. Stiffler is working for a big time firm and is working for the worst possible boss ever and Finch is MISSING! Everyone heads back to their old town to attend the high school reunion. The class of 99 does not carry the same rap as they used to back in the day. The present high school jocks do come across as a challenge but that will not stop the boys from having fun while breaking the law just like they used to back in the day.Biggs and Scott are the show as it has been all these years with Hannigan taking a considerable back seating for this one. It's amazing how connected they are to their characters though. Scott keeps the laughter rolling with everyone pitching in. The humor isn't all vulgar this time round; instead some of the humor is rather decent however the language has not cleaned up over the years. Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg scores a homerun with the direction of American REUNION, after the sinker they directed with HAROLD & KUMAR: ESCAPE FROM GUANTANAMOBAY. Directing this movie is certainly been a walk in the park for the duo since they co-wrote the script with Adam Herz. The screenplay is quite good. Especially with Herz on the team since he has been on board all the AP projects. Furthermore the cast basically has lived and breathed these characters into life for over a decade successfully. Finally I say this is a brilliant job by Hurwitz and Schlossberg especially for recreating the atmosphere of the first movie wrapping us viewers in an American PIE enchantment.TITILE: American REUNION DIRECTED BY: JON HURWITZ & HAYDEN SCHLOSSBERG STARRING: JASON BIGGS, ALYSON HANNIGAN, CHRIS KLEIN,THOMAS IAN NICHOLAS, TARA REID,EDDIE KAYE THOMAS,JENNIFER COOLIDGE, EUGNE LEVY & SEAN WILLIAM SCOTT RATED: R RATING: 07/10 113 MINUTES",American Reunion

84,jaxbubba,"Been there, Seen that!",6,14 April 2012,"Probably the best part of this film is that the director/producer was able to reassemble most of the cast from the ""original"" American Pie circa 1999. Jason Biggs (Jim), Alyson Hannigan (Michelle), Sean William Scott (Stifler), Thomas Ian Nicholas (Kevin), Eddie Kaye Thomas (Finch), and even Chris Klein (Oz) have all returned to reprise their roles after an eight-year hiatus. However, it's Sean William Scott (Stifler) who really makes this film. He steals every scene that he is in, and what laughs there are in this film, can be attributed to his Stifler alter ego high jinx (his scene with an igloo cooler was probably one of the most disgustingly hilariously scenes of the film). The classmates have all returned home to East Great Falls, Michigan to celebrate their 13-year high school reunion. Jim and Michelle have a baby boy, Evan; Oz has a successful TV career, and even Stifler has successfully transitioned to a working Stiff (pardon the pun). Most of the film is a series of events and happenings that occur during their reunion weekend, which places our gang into awkward and most times embarrassing situations. It's crude and adult humor which you have come to expect from this franchise; however, nothing too crude or that over-the-top. If you are a fan of the series, you'll probably enjoy this film as well. However, I would definitely wait for the DVD or watch it On Demand. It's definitely not worth the price of admission at the movie theater!!!

86,cadillac20,Still Funny After All These Years,7,23 March 2012,"I was 16 when the original American Pie came out. It was a film that spoke to me greatly. It was my generation's Ridgemont High, you might say. The sequels too, were enjoyable. But to say that the series didn't wear itself thin might be an understatement. And don't even get me started on the direct to DVD creations. However, American Reunion surprised me with a couple entertaining trailers, and nostalgia grabbed me by the balls. Having had the opportunity to see an early screening, I am happy to say that this is the series I remembered it being.There's nothing too outside the norm for an American Pie series film. We find the original cast living life over ten years after the original film. Jim and Michelle are having a few marital issues and raising a kid. Stiffler is working a job as a temp, dealing with an a-hole boss. Finch has become a mystery of sorts. Oz is a big shot sportscaster with a supermodel girlfriend. And Kevin is a stay at home husband, slash architect. The group returns for their high school reunion and reconnect with each other and their fellow classmates. But this is a film that is as much about the audience seeing it as it is about our favorite foursome. As stated, the film isn't remarkable in the plot sense. Unlike the previous films, there isn't a big endgame to cling to. There's no goal of losing virginity like the first film, finding true love like the second film, or having a successful wedding like the third film. Instead, these characters just deal with being back in their hometown and their own individual issues.If anything, the film is highly nostalgic. It's filled with characters and situations reminiscent of the previous films. It still manages to surprise with many of it's shenanigans, from the boys having to get out of some awkward tight spots, to Jim once again finding himself in extremely embarrassing situations. Heck we even get a few truly surprising moments that are also very laugh out loud. But for the audience that grew up on these films, it will be like a trip down memory lane. It's fun seeing all your favorite characters return, from the underused ones to all of the main cast. Even seeing characters like Oz or Vicky, whose real life counterparts haven't had much of a career since the American Pie film, are pleasant to see again. And they all do a great job of reprising these characters. Best of all, the film is hilarious, with plenty of laugh out loud moments.My biggest qualm with the film is it's lack of a strong central plot. Nostalgia only goes so far and there's really nothing to cling to here in terms of something these characters are working for. By comparison, there was the ever present goal of the guys losing their virginity. Here, their personal issues seem meager. Yes, Jim and Michelle are having issues, but you never really feel like it won't work out. Knowing these characters, you already know they love each other. The same goes for most of the others, whom you always feel will come out on top. This despite a few surprises. And with the whole movie revolving around the up coming reunion, an event which doesn't seem to have much affect on the direction these characters take, there's never a real sense of character growth. Instead, you're just hanging out with the boys again, watching them get into trouble.But this is okay. It's okay because the movie is funny. Much of what happens resembles the kind of humorous situations from the other films. There are some truly laugh out loud moments and the surprises will have you howling. Despite my nostalgic interest in the film, I found some genuinely fun and surprising moments. For fans, this should be a no brainer. The film is definitely worth the watch.",American Reunion

88,chaz-28,It's good to see some old friends again,7,14 April 2012,"What high school class puts together their big reunion on the 13th anniversary of their graduation? Well, if it needs to fit the plot because American Reunion was a few years late, then it's made to seem like it's the most normal event in the world rather than a plot device. All of the main characters we were first introduced to in 1999 are back and it feels comfortable and nostalgic. Also, for those of us who have passed the 30 mark, it is refreshing to see that other people have as well, even the American Pie kids.The characters are in various stages of success and home life and for whatever reason, some just get a lot more attention this time around while other are shuffled towards the back of the line. Jim (Jason Biggs) and Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) remain front and center and show up to reunion weekend with a two year kid and lack of steam in the bedroom. They stay with Jim's Dad (Eugene Levy) who is just going through the motions after losing his wife three years ago. The most successful of the group is Oz (Chris Klein). He lives in L.A. and is on TV as a sports anchor as well as carrying around his fame from a stint on a rip-off version of Dancing with the Stars. He also brings his girlfriend Mia (Katrina Bowden) who has to drink at every ""I never"" in the 'I never' game because she is soexperienced.For some reason, Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) is a bit of an afterthought here. He was right up front in the first two films in the series but now he has faded to make room for the more outlandish characters. He has a long-term girlfriend who has a bit of a DVR obsession but no real problems. Vicki (Tara Reid) shows up for the weekend so the audience gets to watch to see if they will or they won't. It doesn't really matter. Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) screams up on a motorcycle and appears to be the most interesting man in the world with tales of South America and Africa. Finally, there is Stifler (Seann William Scott). He never left town, still lives at home, and works a horrible office temp job. This reunion weekend is lined up to be the highlight of his decade.That was a lot of plot description and there are still plenty of characters not mentioned. This is what reunions are for, you see people you used to know and get the two minute ""what have you been up to the past 13 years?"" Even though all the kids are now grown up and have adult lives, they are still able to find themselves in those classic American Pie sexual mortifying episodes. Jim and Jim's dad still have those frequent and choppy sex conversations which are no longer amusing, there are misunderstandings when caught with half-naked teenagers, and Stifler still creates the most absurd yet hysterical comedic episodes.Instead of the usual American Pie crew, they brought in the Harold & Kumar team (John Hurwitz, Hayden Schlossberg) to breathe some fresh life into this iteration. They also brought back all of the original cast members. Just like at a real reunion, you start asking yourself where have some of these people been lately? Jason Biggs, Tara Reid, Thomas Ian Nicholas, Chris Klein, Mena Suvari, etc It's good to see you guys again but I know that after this reunion, you're just going to leave again and I probably will not see you for another few years.The pranks and shocking scenes live up to their predecessors' example and American Reunion has surprisingly made itself to be a quality get together. It was easy to upstage the lousy American Wedding and move past the mostly forgettable American Pie 2. Reunion does not reach the peak of the original film, but it is enjoyable and if you look past the ridiculous 13 year issue, you will laugh and enjoy the time with some old character friends of yours.",American Reunion
89,Treyroo,No Point,5,24 November 2012,"I normally begin these reviews with a question. My only question for this film, the fourth in the series, why?All our favorite sex-obsessed high-school students are now 13 years older and experiencing varied levels of disappointment with the current state of their lives. Jim Levenstein (played by Jason Biggs) is married to the same girl he's loved since high school and they have a two-year old son. They are completely out of sync romantically. Jim's (Biggs') sex life revolves around his laptop and Michelle, his wife, (played by Alyson Hannigan) is dependent on mechanical devices. Chris ""Oz"" Ostreicher (played by Chris Klein) is a TV sports anchor living with a supermodel. I said he was unhappy with his life, I didn't say I could explain why. Kevin (played by Thomas Ian Nicholas) is a married architect who works from home in addition to running the household. Lastly, Steven Stifler (played by Seann William Scott) is still carrying an attitude big enough to fill most rooms and some buildings despite working as a poorly-paid office temp and living at home with his mother. Even though they missed the ten-year mark by three years, Kevin, Oz, and Jim decide to plan a reunion and ""forget"" to invite Stifler. But, somehow, he shows up anyway.I didn't catch any of the spin-off films, e.g. American Pie presents The Naked Mile, Beta House, or The Book of Love. I did see Band Camp, and will regret it till the day I die. Having seen the original film and both the canonical sequels, I can say unequivocally that there's nothing new here. Embarrassment, obscenity, and nudity from people who really have no business being naked anywhere, let alone on screen.",American Reunion
90,garethvk,A Very Enjoyable Slice of American Pie,7,6 April 2012,"It has often been said that you cannot turn back the hands of time, but thankfully Hollywood is a place where magical things happen. In the case of the gang from American Pie and the creative talents of writer directors Jon Hurwitz Hayden Schlossberg, the gang is back, better than ever, for another slice if pie. Hurwitz and Schlossberg are the creative team behind the "" Harold and Kumar"" series and have been entrusted by Universal to carry on the American Pie series which had recently been relegated to four direct-to-DVD releases.The new film reunites the entire cast from the original three films and centers around the gang's 13 year high school reunion. Life has definitely taken them all in some unexpected directions. Jim (Jason Biggs) is married to Michelle (Alyson Hannigan), and are now parents to a little boy and enjoying a comfortable, if a tad uneventful, suburban lifestyle.Oz (Chris Klein), is a successful Los Angeles sportscaster as well as a recent contestant on a popular national dance show. He spends his time mixing with celebrities and indulging a girlfriend who loves to party just a bit too much. Meanwhile, Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas), is happily married but needs an escape from a domestic routine that includes watching reality shows with his wife.Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) fancies himself a nomadic spirit who wanders the globe from one esoteric adventure to another, still looking for his true love while Stiffler (Seann William Scott), works at a prestigious firm and remains the guy who never misses an opportunity to wisecrack or sexually harass any female who crosses his path.As reunion-type movies go, there are the expected moments of awkwardness and hilarity. And of course, it wouldn't be an American Pie movie without moments of ridiculously crude antics, mainly from Stifler. What separates the film from the bevy of raunchy comedies that flooded the market after the success of the initial film, is that there is some maturity amongst the mayhem.In between the outrageous antics, the various characters are forced to take deep examinations of their lives since graduation and in some cases grow up for the first time in their lives. Oz must comes to grips with his feelings for his former girlfriend Heather (Mena Suvari), as does Kevin when his former flame Vicky (Tara Reid), returns to town for the reunion. Jim and Michelle have to find a way to bring some sexual spark back into their lives while Finch needs to accept the mundane reality of his. And Stifler. Well, let's just say he needs to find his true calling.What really sold the film for me was not just the great chemistry between the cast but the way the script deftly moved the raunchy comedy along while combining character development and depth that is not normally found in films of this type. As I watched, I found that I had really missed this crew of unlikely friends, and really enjoyed catching up with them even when they were not extricating themselves from one over-the-top situation after another.While the film did drag a bit slightly there was always an outrageous moment right around the corner that had the theater errupting in laughter or shrieking in disbelief. This film is rated R for good reason. The cast worked really great together and it was especially nice to see Klein back in the mix, as he had been noticeably absent from the last film in no small part due to his offscreen issues.Eugene Levy and Jennifer Coolidge (Stifler's mom) have some absolutely hysterical moments in film especially when Mr. Levenstein, widowed now for three years, decides to cut loose at a party and we get to see has wild side. I would also encourage viewers to make sure to stay through the credits as there is more comedy from this pair that must not be missed.The supporting characters from the previous films were all given their moments to shine even if it is just in a small cameo. Shannon Elizabeth, Natasha Lyonne, John Cho, and of course, the Sherminator were all given a chance to bring back some memories, making this film is welcome and enjoyably nostalgic trip. It proves that there's still some life and good times left in the series, and if the creative talents can keep quality to this level I, for one, would certainly welcome another slice of pie in the future.3.5 stars out of 5",American Reunion
91,nlytnd_1,"If you liked the first movie, you'll like this one!",8,1 January 2013,"I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie. Of course the original is a classic, but the 2nd and 3rd American Pie really seemed unnatural and forced, so I had no expectations for this movie. This movie on the other hand had the natural feel as the first, I believed the characters. Stiffler's Character was so forced an unnatural in the 2nd and 3rd movie, but his character felt authentic in this and he enhances this movie. Another thing that really got old were the dudes always playing the chump in the other movies. With Rookie of the year always getting the shaft. Some how he didn't get laid in his Freshman college year? Finally, they get props in this movie. One thing really lame about this movie was the awkward scenarios the director for whatever reason felt the need to present. I can maybe understand 1 random awkward scenario, but it got really stupid. It's not funny, it's not clever, it's actually very uncomfortable to watch and it doesn't give the viewer complete closure. For example; Jim's next door neighbor's head in his lap, while the milf dude catches him in the act. You just new that he was going to bring it up to Michele at some point, which he did, which never got complete closure. Then Jim gets caught in an extremely awkward position with that same neighbor with little closure. Really stupid!!! Strikers girlfriend basically starts raping him, just as the gal who he's in love with (from the 1st movie) walks in and catches him in the act while they had a serious heart to heart the previous night. Awkward, not funny and not necessary. Also, the scene were the mom is dancing on Striker and the dad walks downstairs and it looks like he's bending her over. Not the biggest of deals, but how many times is the move going to play out someone getting caught in 1,000,000:1 position? You can play it out in a move once, maybe twice, but it got a little ridiculous! My favorite part of the movie was when Stiffler was hitting on the high- school chicks, pretending to be Jim's best friend. It felt genuine, it wasn't far fetched, and just hilarious! I did like how the movie evolved Stiffler. Prior to the movie I thought they should have presented a slightly more mature Stiffler, yet obnoxious, rather then the far fetched trying too hard character, but I liked how they did it. They had him evolve into the character that I originally wanted. One thing that is getting really old in sequels in recent years is, rather then create an original idea for a sequel they find a way to recreate the original. Usually in a different location. Next movie that recreates the original, I'm totally walking out. They do it in this movie a little bit, but I feel it's fitting in a high-school reunion scenario. Anywho, really entertaining. I think it would be hard to find someone who didn't like this movie.",American Reunion
92,DJRMewzique,A reunion I was so glad to attend!,8,4 April 2012,"There is really not much to say here except that the return of Stifler and his posse....and just about every single memorable character from the first three films...are welcomed back with open arms in ""American Reunion."" After three absolutely sensational, immature-but-awesome comedies about sex, masturbation and fart jokes (somewhat ignoring the somewhat mediocre offshoots ""Band Camp,"" ""The Naked Mile,"" ""Beta House"" and ""The Look of Love""), I really did not know if, over a decade later, with all the actors and characters older, they could recapture the crude magic that made the first three instalments such comedy classic.Guess what? They did.It is now thirteen years later and the crew converge upon their high school, all grown up now, for their, you guessed it, high school reunion. And yes, the film relies heavily on nostalgia and clichés about friends, sex and lost love, but the writing here is so great, it really doesn't matter. The film continues the series' reputation of being politically incorrect and walking the line of taste while still managing to present it all in a way that makes the audience laugh out loud despite themselves. All the main characters returned, played by all the original actors including Jason Biggs, Alyson Hannigan, Sean William Scott, Chris Klein, Thomas Ian Nicholas and Eddie Kaye Thomas. Jennifer Coolidge is still as much a MILF as Stifler's mom while Eugene Levy, the only one to appear in ever single incarnation of these films, continues his signature role of Jim's dad. Even Tara Reid and Mena Suvari are back in the mix.Loads of ridiculous situations, a disgusting hijink and fantastically hilarious comedy ensues as the gang gets back together, having aged stupendously (Klein's body has gotten even more porn-worthy) and making this long-awaited return well worth the time and effort. And if this film makes the box office it deserves, we may just get invited back to the party one more time. And I'll be there with bells on.",American Reunion
93,cyifly-2,Again? Really?,5,24 November 2012,"Anytime Hollywood execs make a decent amount of money off of one comedy, they pound it to death until there is nothing redeemable about the original and there is not another dime to squeeze out of it. Sadly, it's what they have done with many comedies, and they did it to American Pie too. The original was, well... original and hilarious. The second one wasn't as good, but it was at least OK. Now...(sigh) who even remembers how good the first one was when they have made people hate them with the followups? I rented this. The reason I didn't bother with the theatrical version is because after the first two, the rest have been dreadful and I never bothered with the straight-to-DVD disaster sequels. This was a little better than some of them, but not much. There were a few times I laughed out loud. But for the most part, it seemed like the concept was to see how much they could gross you out with toilet/sex humor. Stiffler should have been offed by some gruesome accident after the first one. THAT would have been funny. Why is he still here? For that matter, so should have the franchise. Please don't make another... If they do, please don't see it so it can finally die the gruesome, slow death Hollywood has drug out.",American Reunion
94,DarthPaul85,"Nice to have the full cast again, but is it too late?",6,11 April 2012,"I loved the first three American pie movies, so I had high expectations for this one...even though I thought the trailers made it look bad.This was not as funny as the first three (unless my memory of the first one is foggy). That is why I gave this movie a 6 out of 10. It's not a bad movie, but it's not as funny as the others. In the first three movies, the humor builds and builds each time- going to more absurd (yet believable) extremes. Here it feels like they went in a totally different direction. They still try to give us the jokes we had before, but the movie ""knows"" they've been done, and so doesn't try as hard to deliver them. And unfortunately, no new style of humor or level of jokes replaces them.The movie instead gambles that we are more interested in seeing the plot unravel- and to its credit, I was interested to see how the characters have changed and what they were doing now.Unfortunately, the movie doesn't really do anything that ""wedding"" didn't already do better- the jokes in ""wedding"" are zanier, fresher, and push the envelope further. It also has more energy, and the character arcs (for some) are more satisfying.On the other hand, this time we finally get all of our main (and secondary) characters back again, so this movie has much greater nostalgia value than ""wedding."" It's nice to see Oz and (American Beauty chick?) back in the mix, even though Stiffler and Jim are more entertaining. The show-stealer award goes to the ""asian guy."" His return was the highlight of the movie for me. The fact that virtually every memorable character from the series makes a notable return here is almost worth the price of admission. And it's always fun to play the 90's nostalgia card.So in the end, if you liked the characters from the other movies, or can relate to them on a personal level (like me, a young thirty-something coming to grips with the real world), this movie is worth your time. But if you're new to the American pie movies, then this one probably won't win you over.",American Reunion
95,tgooderson,No better than the originals but no worse.,7,3 May 2012,"Thirteen years after graduating high school, friends Jim (Jason Biggs), Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas), Oz (Chris Klein), Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) and Stifler (Seann William Scott) all end up back in their home town of East Great Falls for their High School Reunion. The plot centres around Jim and Michelle's (Alyson Hannigan) stuttering marriage and on Stifler's inability to grow up. Apart from that there are numerous side stories regarding every main character including Jim's Dad's (Eugene Levy) loneliness after the death of his wife and various old feelings returning.The whole cast of the original movie have returned and there are even cameos from the likes of The Sherminator and the Milf Guys. Most of the cameos are welcome and either bring closure to their story or a bit of humour but Shannon Elizabeth's Nadia made a brief and unremarkable appearance. I especially enjoyed the Milf Guys small subplot and their closing dialogue. The film has found a way to bring together all the pieces from the original trilogy and ties them off well. There are still some big surprises (""Milf! Milf!), some upsets and even a couple of new characters but the film is at its best when the guys are together being themselves and in particular one scene featuring Stifler and Jim's Dad. It was also nice to see Stifler's Mom (Jennifer Coolidge) and Jim's Dad get some screen time together as they have been so successful in the past in many of Christopher Guest's movies.At times the sentimentality and drama put a stop to the laughs and the series has always been at its best when Stifler is up to something disgusting or Jim is getting himself in an embarrassing situation. The more dramatic scenes bought a bit of depth to the story but I'd rather of just had another couple of scenes of Stifler calling someone a dick and pulling that face. Talking of sentimentality though, that is kind of how I feel about the films. Although I'm a couple of years younger than the characters, it feels as though I've been with them every step of the way. While they were trying to get laid back in American Pie, we were doing just the same. Now, 13 years later, the characters have grown up and just like my friends and I; some are successful, some are not, some are married and some have children. It's funny how our lives have echoed theirs. Although, they've seen way more hot chicks with their boobs out.And on that subject, there is plenty of that in the film. One of the best scenes in the film involves Jim trying to keep his cool and do the right thing while a hot neighbour is throwing herself at him. Add Stifler to the equation and some PVC sex gear and you've got a classic American Pie set up. Something that has improved throughout the series is the acting. The whole cast seem much more at ease than in the originals and apart from the odd one (Tara Reid) can act with some conviction now.This film is everything you'd expect and want from an American Pie movie. It's funny, irreverent and silly but with a sweet centre. And while there is nothing new and some of the jokes miss the mark, the majority still made me laugh and made me feel 15 again. The dramatic scenes are a bit of a drag and it's probably a three star movie but my affection for the series makes me want to give it a four. It's no better than the original two but no worse either.www.attheback.blogspot.com",American Reunion
96,GLanoue,Shallow but fun,6,16 July 2012,"I wanted to hate this film, with its sophomoric and forced sexual humour, but I didn't. Yes, it makes everyone look they're still in high school. Yes, there's a misogynist thread running through the film (girls are bimbos, aggressive skanks or sweet but not too bright). Yes, a lot of the plot was forced so they had someplace where they could graft the jokes. But, it works. Sometimes it happens. Formulaic writing sometimes urges actors to dial it in, but here even the sappy, ""but he's our Stifler"" moment, when the friends realise that the Stiffmeister is basically an a-hole but they still love him, friends-forever through thick and thin kind of thing, manages to work because the actors are mostly decent and manage to communicate some chemistry, as if they had some real fun making the movie. Stifler's Mom, Jennifer Coolidge one of the most underrated actors around, really scores some points with just a few phrases and expressions when she puts the Stiffmeister in his place (on the phone, even harder to do), and when she parties with everyone's favourite dad, Eugene Levy. Stifler's reaction to the gay couple moment is actually believable and funny (it only lasts 30 seconds or so). Rebecca De Mornay is a believable cougar (not a surprise, because she is even more attractive now than 3 decades ago). Vik Sahay as Stifler's douche boss is over the top, but that's bad writing, not bad acting. Despite these little grace notes, the story is, as I said, well, there's no other word for it, silly. Where in real life do relatively successful people on the career ladder invest so much in high school nostalgia? Didn't they go to college? The story tries to present them as adults, but ultimately it's not the idiotic hi-jinx that brand them as immature, it's the posing, the shallow addiction to feelings, the desperate need to connect in the most primordial way possible. It's as if these people can only relate to the world through their sex organs, but most of the gang are not getting any, so they're a little bit at sea. Even the so-called marital issues in Jim and Michelle's marriage can't be talked about in a mature way. On the other hand, there are genuinely funny moments between Jim and Kara, his ex neighbour he used to babysit who's all grown up and eager to lose her virginity. Funny, if you can believe that Ali Cobrin, who's got more healthy sex appeal (like a younger Cameron Diaz) in her little finger than most people do in their entire bodies, would have held out in the hedonistic atmosphere that dominates the high school, at least according to the movie. That being said, it's enjoyable on some basic level; not the best coming of age comedy, but not the worst.",American Reunion
97,jefflouvre-435-77367,"Lots of sex, but it's mainly talk; the boys realize it's time to grow up",6,13 August 2012,"American Reunion, of course, sees the five boys back in town for their high school reunion. Those who have followed the series from the first one know that despite the raunchy talk and abundant displays of breasts and penises, the theme of movies is rather sedate, and kinda sweet. In the first one, the boys, despite all five making a pact to lose their virginity by their prom, showed a different side to normally crass movie characters of their age.In this fourth installment, the boys still maintain their sweetness, and go through many obstacles to realize that they're no longer in high school and that it's time to grow up. Only Stifler gets to maintain his repulsive persona; he even gets to denigrate an Asian character, and his penis.As Biggs (Jim) and Scott(Stifler) are the executive producers of this flick, it's only natural that the movie devotes more time to these two. So we have Jim stuck in a rut after a few years of marriage and having a child. And then we have Stifler still chasing women and treating them as commodities.At the start of the flick, Jason can get it on only with pornography while his wife prefers the shower head. Their love life is absent and it's up to Jim's dad to set things straight by telling his son that the couple must be husband and wife to each other. Of course, they get to 'consummate' their relationship at the end of the flick, but not before they go through various stages of undress to get to their goal.Stifler remains true to himself, and even gets to fornicate with Finch's mum, a true case of revenge.Oz gets to break a few moves in a dance reality show, and he realizes that he must be true to his heart, that is, he must return to his sweetheart. In a truth or dare game, he can't understand his model girlfriend's sexual experiences, especially those that take place in public places and in orgies.Kevin realizes that he has feelings for his first love, and is man enough to admit that.Finch, surprisingly, doesn't hop into bed with Stifler's mother in this flick. He concocts a yarn about traveling across the world, all to impress his friends and a dark-skinned beauty, the flick's only concession to minorities. However, I found it hard to believe that they forgave him easily without even batting an eye.As readers can see, the whole movie is about sex, or the absence of it for some characters. But the movie deals with it in a sweet and humorous way and everything is settled by the end.",American Reunion
98,MarcusJ13,A fun film mostly for the fans,7,21 May 2012,"It's been a long time since the American Pie series hit screens but gladly it was at least not a complete rehash. The film is mostly a nostalgia trip for the characters and once again attempts an ensemble but focuses mostly on Jim and Michelle as they are the ones with the stale marriage at the moment. The film is quite brisk in length so it is more or less why it struggles to truly be an ensemble. Of course at some point we get the cameo reel of minor characters as seen in the previous films. Regardless if you are familiar with the series you will appreciate this. There are still the crass jokes that have become the staple and you know pretty much straight away how the jokes will probably progress but I found them funny. If you are not familiar with the films then it will look like a case a simply rinse and repeat. Some however will enjoy the delivery of the jokes. They appeal to a certain sense of humour and you are going to know whether you want to see this film or not straight away just by seeing some of the previews. Maybe it was expected but Jim's dad truly stole the show seeing him trying to fit in with parties and join the likes of Jim in their escapades. Stifler was very much a character enjoyed more in moderation than previous films. Thankfully he never got to annoying and always maintained his humour. Overall there isn't too much else to say about the film, it has a mixture of cringe and laugh out loud moments still making for a decent nostalgia ride.",American Reunion
99,bharath-karthikeyan,12 years after the first...American Reunion is a recollection of the good years,7,12 July 2012,"American pie had me at early teens when it first came out,it was hilarious,made us laugh,had the right proportion of R rated content and was a breeze to watch.I could easily say it was some movie any adult can relate to and enjoy. And now after so many years when a sequel for such a movie comes out,it makes me think American Pie series of movies has indeed come close to be called as a cult series with stifler and other memorable characters.An example in the department of teen comedies of course. American reunion takes us to many years down the lane after the first installment,12 years later perhaps :P and we see the main cast from the first three movies either settled or taken a different course from their college lives.Sean William Scott is back as stifler and he is someone who has kept the movie going.The movie did have its moments but also some dull parts. But overall if you have been faithfully following these series or if you want some movie to unwind and have a good laugh,American reunion is perfect for you!",American Reunion
100,facebook-124-955845,True friendships last a lifetime,7,30 March 2012,"In July of 1999 audiences were introduced to American Pie, a movie that showcased the sexual frustrations of Jim (Jason Biggs), Oz (Christopher Klein), Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas), and Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas); the four friends make a pact to lose their virginity by their Senior Prom. The breakout star of the film was Stifler, played by Sean William Scott, whose offensive and rude behavior was uproarious and solidified Stifler as one of the funniest characters in recent memory. The film went on to gross over $235 million dollars and was a surprise hit. In the two subsequent sequels (not including the direct to DVD films), the characters aged, but never matured; always finding themselves in precarious predicaments and as they grew up, we grew up right along with them. In the newest film, American Reunion, the whole gang returns home to East Great Falls, Michigan to celebrate their 10 year high school reunion, ""13 years later"". The writing team of Hayden Schlossberg and Jon Hurwitz, who'd done a more than admirable job on the Harold and Kumar films, were given writing and directing duties on American Reunion. I give both men credit for not trying to do too much and by sticking with the formula that made the prior movies so successful, because ""if it's not broke, don't fix it"". Schlossberg and Hurwitz do a perfect job of putting the characters into situations many of us are all too familiar with; some due to getting older and others due to our own stupidity. Unlike The Hangover 2, which recycled the same plot from The Hangover, American Reunion continues the process of advancing the characters further into life. Yes, some of the jokes are rehashed; but sometimes no matter how much someone ages, they never grow up. I'm pretty sure everyone has a friend like Jim, that did something when he was younger that was so ridiculous that he'd never live it down; ours goes by the name of Shmo and he's proud to be that guy. There's the friend that's a jock like Oz, that would do anything to impress a girl; the friend like Kevin, that's the pretty boy and thinks he's destined to be with that one girl; the friend that's the most mature of the bunch and acts a lot older than he actually is, much like Finch; and then there's Stifler, the one guy that all he does is bust balls endlessly and is easily accepted as part of the group. I'd be willing to be I just described a good number of guys that hung out together growing up. Some of us even had a cool dad like Jim's, played by Eugene Levy in every American Pie film including the direct to DVD movies. Although it took years for me to realize it, Eugene Levy is the moral compass of the franchise and gives a rock steady as well as laugh out loud performance each time out. Similar to the previous three films, the strength lies in the believability of what the guys go through; reminiscent of experiences most lifelong friends may have gone through in life. That's not to say that everything that happens in the films is plausible, but it is sure as hell funny watching it all unfold. American Reunion is vulgar, crude, filled with dirty jokes, nudity and all kinds of raunchy behaviorand I love every single last minute of it. Next year will be my 20th year high school reunion, of which I won't be going. I had a number of acquaintances while in high school, but no one that I'd call a true friend. The true friends I've had in life I'm happy to say are now life-long friends of mine. The time we spent together were great and over the years we've made a lot of memories; some low key ones such as sitting up all night playing video games or poker, and other outrageous drunken ones.okay, there were a lot of drunken ones, in which I was always the sober guys. In all the years that have passed, my core group of friends has always remained close and I'm thankful that we've all stayed in touch over the years. It's movies like this and the others in the franchise that stir up memories and conversations that throughout the years are worth remembering, enjoying and laughing about 13, 25, or even 50 years later.

Here's the truth: it's not. While the movie delivers some solid laughs, and a little bit of raunchy humor, it is far too focused on nostalgia. The little overtones and references to the original movie are humorous and well- placed, however they clearly tried too hard to make it reminiscent and it just came off as more of a feel-good, drama-comedy. The character development was good, and the plot was solid, but it was too mushy. Another big problem is that in an attempt at being reminiscent of the first, it repeated a lot of the original gags which really just came across as a little lazy. So, the movie is funny, at times hilarious, and at times sad. It's a fun watch, especially if you are an AP fan, but definitely not as strong as AP and AP 2. Beats American Wedding hands down though. It's fun, and a good look back at the movies so many people grew up watching and loving, but nothing all that special.",American Reunion
105,gstepup,Fourth American PIE film completes a solid quartet piece of Americana,7,16 May 2012,"(SPOILERS) American PIE: REUNION is directed by Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg, with all the major cast members, created by Adam Herz, back in fighting form. The main plot - a long-awaited reunion - is beaten to death as the five guys keep meeting up and reminiscing, with dashes of toilet humor too gross- out for review narration and sexual jokes too tired to contain any punch. Hurwitz and Schlossberg direct capably as a team, and many fine moments with charmingly endearing characters. Only the last third manages to pique your interest, as you wonder who among the exes will get back together. Rebecca De Mornay (perfect foil to Jennifer Coolidge) is an absolute delight as Finch's sultry mother, who hands Stifler a chance for revenge (on Finch) on a silver platter. The 5 male leads are all given equal backstories and highlights, but the ladies' participation is a but uneven (Alyson Hannigan as a frazzled housewife to Jason Biggs, their sexlife nonexistent; Mena Suvari still carrying the torch for Chris Klein, who mopes over the wrong decisions he's made; Tara Reid putting Thomas Ian Nicholas in a quandary of guilt feelings, etc.). As in the former films, Eugene Levy (as Jim's dad) and Coolidge (as Stifler's mom) steal the scenes from most everyone else. A teenage girl (Ali Kobrin) is added, as her adolescent overtures to Jim are feebly rebuffed, and her birthday party sets the scene for youngsters partying wildly while the 5 guys compare the 1990s lifestyles with modern day. The first three films had family values deeply entrenched in the plots, despite the plethora of sex jokes and toilet humor. American REUNION has an ambivalent tone this time, e.g., as where Jim eggs his widower dad to get back into the dating scene; Stifler's best buddies turn out to be a gay couple; Jim and Michelle miss out one their sex lives and are forced to have ""alone"" moments pleasuring themselves, etc. The most interesting character change is Stifler's (Seann William Scott), who improves himself from a sexually addicted, obnoxious prankster to a middle-aged guy who realizes times have really changed. Corollary to this, Scott has the best scenes, along with Levy, Coolidge, DeMornay and Rebecca Field (as a plump girl who manages to have Scott ""go down"" on her and afterwards refusing to reciprocate). Jason Biggs has an absolutely hilarious frontal nudity scene. 50 years from now, the American PIE films will have been a fairly remarkable series of Americana, much like Americans view the Andy Hardy (Mickey Rooney) films of yore.",American Reunion
106,mad_mandonna,"Not reinventing the comedy wheel, but still pretty darn funny.",6,11 May 2012,"OK so when Jim had sex with a pie in the original American Pie, it was the most cringe worthy, most funny moment I'd had with a teen comedy up to that point. Up till this point though the only teen comedies around were Clueless, Ferris Bueller and a few unworthy imitations. Since American Pie dazzled with its gross out and sexually charged humour, other teen films have come in to take up the mantle. Napoleon Dynamite, Mean Girls and Easy A have stolen American Pie's thunder in teen comedy and Bridesmaids and The Hangover have stolen it in gross out. But can American Pie reclaim its prior glory.Well firstly the leads are a little old to come under teen comedy, despite them harking back to the old days, the characters have moved on a bit. The moving on is superficial and to be honest only Jim and Stiflers story lines have any impact whatsoever, so no it won't be taking the crown back. The film was unbelievably predictable, you could see the ending right from the beginning, but the ride was still enjoyable. There were some very funny moments, the opening scenes have always been among the funniest in the series and this one really did make me giggle. Its all crude stuff and you know it's going to be, of course Stifler takes crude to a new level and always has, but that's what makes his character so lovable.American Pie Reunion doesn't quite have the ingenuity that Horrible Bosses has, nor the surprise that The Hangover has, nor the wit of Easy A or even the believable friendships that Bridesmaids has. What it does have is nostalgia, and it works by reminding the audience of what has gone before it. Yes it is funny, but with the characters ageing ten years the style of comedy could have been a little more inventive. But then again is this what the audience wants or is that just me?One thing that stood out to me as rather annoying, is making the gay people in the film the butt of the joke. In this day and age, with American's finally coming round to equality to homosexuality, it's so backwards to see gay people used in this way.In the end it all works out though. I like the American Pie series and my expectations were low, but you know what it actually exceeded my expectations. Yes there's no real storyline, little character development and predictable jokes, but the film intention was to make me laugh and it did just that.",American Reunion
107,amahlanand,1999 comes to 2012,9,8 May 2012,"This film pays homage to the original in 1999, where a bunch of then unknowns combined in an innocent teen comedy to create a legend. This instalment more than lives up to its intense hype and even rivals the original in its scripting, gags and also its humanely, real life touch. For American Pie followers, expect to see Eugene Levy go further than you've seen him go, expect to see Jason Biggs go 'the extra step' in a film and of course, expect the nudity and naughtiness that you would expect from an 'American Pie' movie. For non American Pie buffs, this will serve as a terrific introduction to the series and an epitome of Teen/Sex comedies in general. It will encourage you to delve back into the previous instalments, so long as raunchy comedy is your thing. Either way, you will definitely feel greatly nostalgic for your own past, not least of all if you were an innocent teen when 'American Pie' hit theatres in 1999. In essence, what you are watching is 'American Pie: All Grown Up'. The characters are mostly just the same sex crazy teens in older bodies and this consistency across 13 years is really the highlight. Both directors Hurwitz and Schlossberg have aimed to parallel much of the plot and humour with the style of the first flick in more ways than one, something you'll really appreciate if you've seen it. The biggest improvement though over its predecessor ('American Wedding') was the screen time given to just about all the characters, which was nothing less than fitting. We didn't see an overdose of the notorious Stifler (as in the previous instalment) nor too much of Jim's insecurities or any other such recurring theme of the series.It may have been 13 years since 'American Pie', but the chemistry between this set of actors hasn't so much faded as it has stayed constant if not flourished. It isn't all lewd and crude though, many of the characters, in the particular the Levenstein family, bring a sweet sense of reality, dealing with situations in their lives which can strike one as very relevant and plausible.If this is a reinvigorating of the franchise, it has done its job. If this serves as a conclusion after an underwhelming third instalment, we couldn't have asked for a better way to end the legend that 'American Pie' is.",American Reunion
108,bonzybino,nostalgic piece from the pie series,7,10 July 2012,"American Reunion banks hugely on the successful franchise of American Pie series, and comes as a fitting finale which makes you nostalgic at the same time keeping you entertained. Though it never comes close to any of its predecessors - in terms of tickling your ribs - its hard to turn down, felt more like the huge American Pie fan following getting a get-together after a long time.It was good to see Chris Klein back - he skipped American Wedding - with Mena Suvari, and almost all of them getting back for the reunion, Sean William Scott as Stifler looks hunky, yea with all his loud mouthings as usual! Well, the screenplay might not be the best thing to discuss, for its too loose and shabby - understandable though, with the tough ask of scripting something to bring back the whole team. The track ""laid"" is remixed in the end which was cool. My pick would be how Stiff Meister pays back Finchy big time!! :D If you are a fan of American Pie series, this ones too good to miss! hmm warn u though, to keep your artistic brains away.

109,rum2550,Legacy of our generation.,7,22 July 2012,"First of this is not exactly a review on the movie but rather an emotional statement of mine. After seeing this movie,I was overwhelmed by the nostalgia for the 90s which used to be our school days.Although I am from a different regional and cultural background, these characters represent our generation. That is why even now, when our classmates from school or batch-mates from the university meet up together, some funny scenes in American Pie are reminded with a laugh every now and then.That large,white desktop monitor with a web-cam on top of it in Jim's old room was enough to evoke a lot of memories of the decade. It is quite moving to see that Jim and his friends have become mature and more responsible and established in their careers and gotten kids in the same way the life has changed over the last 13 years for me and my friends. Along with ""Good old fashioned orgy"" and ""Young adult"" this was the 3rd movie I saw over past few months that were made about our generation with nostalgic elements of 90s high school life. I really miss those times.",American Reunion
110,FFman-847-460126,A Worthwhile Sequel,6,6 April 2012,"I went into American Reunion knowing that the series has been taken over by the Harold and Kumar duo—Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg. Whether or not that would be a positive aspect was still up in the air. As the movie started, it appeared to be a bad thing. The first 20-30 minutes of this movie are extremely slow and contain some very bad writing. I even cringed twice at some of the actors forced out horrible lines.It seems that the writers simply weren't sure how to start the movie. From the half hour mark on, American Reunion is everything is promises to be. The age gap between the characters now and the characters in high school is a constant highlight and source of humor. As a child of the 1980's myself, this humor got me every time. Having the music of my youth referred to as ""Classic Rock"" really is as crushing as it is hilarious.Each character brings a fascinating storyline to the table. From sex deprivation to sports newscaster to businessman to world traveler to housewife, the American Pie group has taken on an entirely new—and adult —edge. By bringing back all (and yes—I mean ALL) of the original characters, the movie gives the viewer a chance to reminisce while simultaneously enjoying a new and all too entertaining storyline.I must confess that the connections outside of the movie do have a strangely enjoyable effect on American Reunion. For one, Alyson Hannigan has become rather famous though How I Met Your Mother. When Neil Patrick Harris makes a guest appearance, I can't help but think, ""Suit Up."" On the other end of the spectrum, John Cho comes back to the cast after hitting it big with Harold and Kumar. Seeing him yelling ""MILF"" gave me an instant craving for White Castle.For those of you who enjoyed the original American Pie, American Reunion is worth you money. If you were not a fan of the original, then you certainly will not enjoy American Reunion. Even though the franchise is under new management, it still has the feel of the old movies. If you have not seen American Pie yet, it is not necessary (but I highly recommend it). Last of all, I must point out that it has become mainstream to leave every single movie open for a sequel. American Reunion is no different. Although this annoys me, I cannot hold it against them. American Reunion is worth seeing.reillyreviews.wordpress.com",American Reunion
111,dimarinc,A Must See Refresh of the American Pie Series,8,11 April 2012,"American Reunion was an excellent movie. It surpassed my expectations which is impressive because I was a definite fan of the originals. It does fans of all characters in the series justice and has more laughs than any movie I've seen in a while. It carries that old American Pie charm that is nostalgic of the comedies from the late 90s. The plot is a school reunion that provides all the characters a chance to return to their hometown. You get a glimpse into how their lives have changed and the comedy associated with it.This movie is a flat out success for a comedy. It takes advantage of the fact that you should know and love the characters and focuses on making you laugh. Some of the jokes and the set ups really surprised me, as you could tell a lot of development went into this script. Every character has their share of jokes and the world remembers why Stiffler was one of the funniest characters ever.I have nothing bad to say about this movie. It's hard for a movie that has such high expectations to be a 10, but for what it was tasked with, I think this movie executed extremely well.I would recommend this movie to everyone. Period.",American Reunion

113,devcybiko,A Collection of Every Reunion Cliché Ever Used In Cinema,4,8 April 2012,"WEEKLY MOVIE REVIEW: American REUNIONMINI-REVIEW: A Collection of Every Reunion Cliché Ever Used In CinemaRATING: Don't waste your time. (Rating System: ""See it in theaters,"" ""Wait for the instant download,"" ""Don't waste your time."")Jim Levenstein (Jason Biggs) and his bride Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) of 5 years have a two- year old son and the zip has gone out of their marriage. They vow to have some together time at an upcoming 13-year high-school reunion. When Jim arrives, he meets up with his buddies from high school: Kevin Myers (Tomas Ian Nicholas), Chris ""Oz"" Ostreicher (Chris Klein), and Paul Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas). They have all achieved some degree of success.The couple are staying with Jim's father, Noah (Eugene Levy) who offers unwarranted marital advice.The four buddies are enjoying a night out a few days before the reunion when an old, but unwanted friend appears: Steve Stifler (Seann Willam Scott). Stifler still lives life as though he were in high school and works as a temp at a major company. Later, Jim meets newly 18- year-old Kara (Ali Cobrin) who is hot for Jim, who was her babysitter all those years ago. Can Jim and Michelle rekindle their love life? Can Jim stave off the advances of young Kara? Will the other guys meet up with their old flames? Will Stifler cause more trouble with his high- school pranks?Yes.This is a wholly predictable and unimaginative retread of an American classic: ""American Pie,"" which first hit theaters 13 years ago. THAT movie was original and took a fresh look at the coming of age story. And if you haven't seen ""American Pie"" recently (or ever) I recommend you go back and see it again. Because you'll have to do your homework to keep up with the plot in this sequel.And be warned: there are plenty of boobs and penises to be seen in the film. Not that there is anything wrong with that. You should know that it is coming at you.Everything you expect to see is telescoped in the first 20 minutes of the film. Jim has an encounter with the young girl, Stifler makes juvenile pranks, old flames kiss, someone isn't who he says he is, the married couple survive, and everyone realizes that high school is now behind them and the best of times are right now. And Eugene Levy is still one of the funniest men alive.So for sophomoric comedy and a predictable plot line borrowed from Romy & Michelle's High School Reunion, Family Guy, and just about every sit com ever written, I recommend you don't waste your time.",American Reunion
114,FrostyChud,Has American sexuality really become this etiolated?,5,10 May 2012,"I entered the theater in a depressed mood after having some blood work done for a bothersome medical condition and left in an even worse mood. My sick body is constantly on my mind, and the spectacle of Life usually raises my spirits. Alas, there is very little life on the screen in ""American Reunion"". Although the movie is all above love and sex, there is nothing even slightly erotic here. Underneath the wiggling behinds and rounds of tequila shots...beats a puritan heart. On one hand, we have the dreadfully boring and pussified Jim with his dreadful and pussified wife. Their sex life is dead because they are wasting their lives. Next we have the dreadfully boring Oz. His situation is not so different. Stifler appears to offer a contrast, but it's a mirage. His fantasies are all shallow and boring and don't go any farther than rutting...which has nothing to do with true Eros as such. He's no less sterile than the others. The women are all prudes. Their pinched, Botoxed, suntanned faces express nothing but fear and conventionality. The bodies are beautiful, but they are the products of obsessive narcissistic upkeep that serves principally to flee the central dimension of sex, namely a real encounter with a real Other...like a guy who washes his car all the time but is afraid to drive it or park it too near other cars. The neighbor character has great breasts but there is nothing sexual about her...it's just a Girls Gone Wild masquerade that hides a boring and timid soul. They should have made her 15, not 18. The Tara Reid character with her BS tears because that guy thought she would stoop to sleeping with him, a married man, after a night of drinking...what a prude...what hypocrisy. Are there really people out there like this? Thank God I got the hell out of that depressing world years ago. The Mena Suvari character is a similar prude in the same mold. They're all prudes, my God. The only story with the slightest bit of real electricity is the story between Finch and the bartender babe. Why? Because there is an element of fantasy there...of creation, of construction...whereas all of the other couplings are just about the reproduction of the eternal same...i.e. ideology. This film is propaganda for an empty, puritan sexuality that presents itself as transgressive. It makes me sad that young people in other, less sexually hypocritical countries might swallow the bait. The colors...the houses...the bars...the parties...the clothes...there is nothing concrete here, nothing Historical in the Hegelian sense, no Geist, no spirit, no outside to speak of, no engagement with the background...just a bland nowhere populated by bland nobodies...total claustrophobia. Rather than venturing out into the world and interacting with real Others, the characters here all turn fearfully inwards, towards the protective security of sterile relationships conducted under the loving but stern gaze of habit and puritan sexual ideology. The message behind this movie is simple: sex is dirty, sex is bad, sex is scary, marry that boring girl or guy next door and wait to die.",American Reunion
115,DoctorRabbit,Another good slice of pie,7,8 April 2012,"While i've never been the biggest fan of the franchise, i've always enjoyed the American Pie films. They are all funny, sweet, and feel good movies that are pretty hard not to enjoy. When I heard they were making a fourth film with the entire original cast, I was really interested to see how it would turn out. While I don't think American Reunion is the best of the franchise, it's still very enjoyable and has some great moments. The opening scene is hysterical and easily one of the best moments of the entire franchise. The film plays off many of the same gags that the first 3 films did. While it doesn't really offer anything new, these gags are still pretty funny for the most part. The film did a really good job of capturing the humor and sweetness that the original films did. The film also managed to improve on one of the series biggest flaws which was not dragging jokes out for too long. The jokes here never dragged out too long and feel like they are given just the right amount of time on screen. I highly recommend though that you see the first three films though before this one since many of the jokes and moments reference events from the original films. Unfortunately, American Reunion does have a good amount of flaws to it. The films biggest flaw is that it doesn't remain constantly funny throughout. While there were some really funny moments, there were some pretty big gaps between them. These gaps would at worst be as long 10 minutes that would consist of no laughs or light chuckles. There was a party scene in the films first act that went on for a bit too long and I actually found myself starting to get bored. This also causes the film to feel uneven, especially during the second half when some more of the dramatic elements are added in. Even though the American Pie films have always had drama, this one at times felt like it had a bit more drama than it really needed. The film is also nearly two hours and feels a bit too long. They could've cut out about a good ten minutes of footage. This film would've been fine if it had a runtime of around 105 minutes which seems much more suited for this type of film. Overall, despite it's flaws, American Reunion is still another good addition to the American Pie franchise. Ranking among the others, this film is my second favorite in the series next to American Wedding. The film has some of the best moments of the franchise and will not disappoint the fans. Its unfortunate, that it's flaws keep it from being what could've been the best entry in the franchise yet. Die hard fans of the franchise will love it while those who haven't will still find it to be a decent comedy. At it's core, it really just is another American Pie film, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.",American Reunion
116,m1xer,"Great, now delete American Wedding from your Memory!",8,6 March 2013,"FINALLY a comedy sequel done right.The American Pie Franchise and the hilarious character of Steven Stifler have finally returned and been done right! (Unlike American Wedding the 3rd film in the franchise)They had more then enough opportunities to make the franchise come back in style and for the first time since the original. Forget the straight to DVD B rated sequels and American Wedding which was only good for a few laughs and some eyecandy from the strippers.This movie is a feel good comedy with tons of nostalgia, 90s music, explanations, a good feel good comedy that was done very well.The best of the series IMO which is a huge statement.I mean really, how often is the 4th in a series, the best.

117,pascaloetterli,Reunite with a cult movie,8,29 April 2012,"I have rarely seen such a massive crowd entering the local theater at this last Saturday midnight. Most of it were young people, teens or twens, not the ones which have made up the same audience ten years earlier. To my surprise, these people were very eager to watch this newest installment of American Pie. They are used to everything which made the original movie so entertaining, funny and yet so much more deep than it is often perceived. I have witnessed a fiesta, a party and I felt, that this Reunion called upon more than just one generation and that its influence is still strong. The cast has grown - but not grown beyond unrecognizing. There is a difference now, but it is subtle, not ruining the expectations. I find still a lot of deeper understanding of the society in the seemingly simple slice of pie, which have always been so surprising. You can't say anything bad about the actors either, as there is almost no way to introduce any new faces, with the exception of maybe Dania Ramirez.The fun is there too and now full of reminiscences although you won't find too much of new content. It seems a bit more ""correct"" than it was before but it influenced the way we now watch this kind of movies anyway. There is also enough time to develop the protagonists just enough not to make it boring, yet the plot was predictable - but it is since the first movie, isn't? The audience around me loved the Reunion and so did I. American Reunion is a must for everyone who liked the first two installments of American Pie.",American Reunion
118,theredraylives,American Reunion re-captures the magic of '99,8,8 April 2012,"In the summer of '99, this reviewer was fresh out of high school and facing the world ahead- facing the ""next step"" in my life. Along came a little movie called American Pie, a raucous and raunchy comedy about high school, virginity, and growing up. Of course it had all the staples of the raunchy teen comedy- drinking, swearing, more screen time for breasts than some characters, and absurd characters (looking at you, Sherminator), but at its core was a film about the friendship of four men, about learning how to grow up, about the broken road one leaves behind and the bumpy road ahead. As a nineteen-year-old still learning his way about the world, the film carried the all-too important thought that everybody's gotta grow up- the characters did, and so did I.The regular cast of the Pie flicks haven't been seen together in some time- they haven't all been together since 2001's American Pie 2. So the main question that must be asked is- especially after the atrocious Wedding and the throw-away direct-to-DVD sequels- can they re-capture the magic of the original two? The answer is a resounding yes. American Pie was never about one person, it was about the whole cast, their bond, their friendships, and their shared humiliations, failures, and victories. American Reunion succeeds on all of these levels, bringing back the laughter for one last hilarious slice.It's the thirteenth reunion at East Great Falls, but we join our characters in their adult lives to see where they are now. Jim and Michelle are still married, now with a kid, but seem to have hit a pothole in their marriage. Kevin is married and a freelance architect, but is mostly a house husband. Finch has disappeared off the radar, and Oz is a successful sports broadcaster and pseudo-celebrity dating the utterly vacuous Mia. All of them decide to head back into town for the reunion, though none of them decides to tell Stifler, who is still as immature as ever. Getting the four together takes a bit, as the writers take time to re-acquaint the audience with the characters, and this part of the film is admittedly its one downfall, as it is rather slow and isn't very funny (Mia and her gay interior decorator are eye-rolling at best).Eventually the four guys head back into town. Jim runs into a girl he used to babysit, the almost-eighteen Kara, who is overjoyed to see her old babysitter. Jim is tasked with spending time with the guys for the weekend, but also trying to find time to spend with Michelle, as both have realized the gap between them is growing larger. All four guys return and run into Stifler, and the five of them promise to make the weekend one they'll never forget.From here the film is, in every sense, a true successor to the original Pie. Kevin and Oz's lost loves return in Vicky and Heather, and old feelings come rushing back. In a welcome bit of character development, Finch doesn't spend the film pining over Stifler's Mom, but has instead met the geek-turned-gorgeous Selena. All of the old staples of the Pie series that made it such a winning hit return- Jim suffers more public humiliations, Stifler's antics are outrageous, Kevin is still boring, and Oz is still hung up on Heather. The guys get stuck in ridiculous situations that they try to squirm themselves out of.The great thing about Reunion is that, even though it is treading familiar territory, the film still feels fresh and funny, and isn't just a ripoff of the first two. Instead it is a great reflection on the fact that things for the characters have changed so much, but that they are undoubtedly still who they are and will never escape that. No matter how much they change, they're still the same people, and best of all the writers knew how to dial it down with the over-the-top nonsense. Stifler is not nearly as absurd and ridiculous as he is in American Wedding, which was one of the film's biggest issues- but he's still Stifler. That said, one of the worst (and best) parts of Reunion is the guys trying to avoid Stifler and still blaming him for being stuck in high school- but by the end they realize that he is one of them, and that without him they just wouldn't be whole. They're not necessarily wrong- Stifler, of all the characters, is still trying to hold onto a life that has long-since ended, and he is finally forced to take the ""next step"" that has been a running theme of this series- the whole series comes full-circle, and that's why it resonates so much.The film can be forgiven for being slow, and for some forced dialogue, and for throw-away cameos by the returning Jessica and Nadia. Particularly the former, whose screen time might be 45 seconds, and none of it is actually shared with Vicky. But for any negative it might have, it is outweighed a thousand times by the film's great moments. Now watching as a 31-year-old adult, removed from college and settled into the hum-drum grind of a daily commute and bills and responsibilities, the film reminds me that one is only as young as one feels- that memories are the most precious things of all- and that whatever life may bring, for all its boredom and drab situations, one's youth only endures as long as one remembers it. Boredom is okay, the daily grind is okay, as long as we remember who we are. Ultimately, we hold onto the past not that we may live in it, but that it may live through us, waiting for those times we get a chance to re-capture it. The past can bring reflection, but the past can also breed change.",American Reunion
119,KEmerton1992,Yet another Great Piece of Pie!,8,7 April 2012,"Okay, I have been waiting to see this film ever since I heard a rumor about it. That being said, I had this ""Phantom Menace"" fear that it was going to be awful. Luckily, I was wrong. This movie was amazing! I was twelve when I saw the original American Pie, and quickly watched the other two. I regretebly watched the ""spin offs"", but they just weren't the same. That's also why I was a bit skeptical of this one, but it picks up right where ""Wedding"" left off and, unlike ""Band Camp"" etc., it has the feeling of the very first movie. It was riotous, but it also had a lot of heart. If you are a fan of the original trilogy, you MUST see this movie! I guarantee you won't be disappointed.",American Reunion
120,FilmPulse,Better than expected,6,13 May 2012,"When I heard they were making a fourth American Pie, my instant reaction was ""Dear god, why does Hollywood have to keep revisiting characters and sacrificing originality with older ideas?"" OK, maybe those weren't my exact words and I just wrote that here in my review, but it was pretty damn close. American Reunion's trailer didn't make me too excited, I just thought most of the cast hadn't had the career that they wanted and figured they could use the extra cash. Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised (not surprised enough to grant it higher than a 6) at what was presented on screen.American Reunion starts off re-introducing us to characters that we haven't seen in 9 years and what their lives have turned into. Jim (Jason Biggs) and Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) are married and have a toddler, Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) is basically a housewife, Oz (Chris Klein) is a successful sports host with girlfriend problems, Stifler (Seann William Scott) is still a douche but in an office, and Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas), well, Finch is a supposed badass mofo which didn't surprise me at all.After the introductions and catch-ups the movie proceeds to the Reunion part of the title and everyone is brought back to their hometown to meet and greet and see who's up to what. There are some funny moments but it feels like a movie designed for the audiences who grew up with the American family. The plot didn't really matter, the problems didn't really matter, it was all just an enjoyable experience to see these actors and characters on the big screen portraying roles that jump started them back in the day.I was most surprised (I'm not sure why) that the jokes and gags that were brought to the table were of the same caliber as the first three American movies. It seems that the actors playing the parts had grown up but the writers who were in charge of the script had not. It felt like the crew had been the victim of real life arrested development (not the same as the show) and forgotten to grow up with their counterparts.While sitting in the theater, I realized that some movies are supposed to be fun and not require you to be an active moviegoer, but rather, sit back and enjoy the images that are whizzing by on the big screen. American Reunion is definitely one of those flicks that doesn't ask for too much of your attention and does not leave you asking for more because it is just the right amount of pie you're looking for.Chad FilmPulse.Net",American Reunion
121,didonatope,A Fine Successor & A Satisfying Last Slice,9,8 May 2012,"American Pie is by far one of the most cherished franchises among the young adult crowd. Ever since 1999, Finch, Jim, Chris, Michelle, Vicki, and Stifler have become household names, and so did band camp. With this newest film, fans will be dying to eat it up like the last slice.American Reunion follows Jim and Michelle (played by Jason Biggs and Alyson Hannigan), who feel like their sex lives have been reduced to zero after having a child. They both hoe that their high school reunion will ignite their love life again and bring old friends back together again.This fourth installment of the franchise has everything American Pie fans love: raunchiness, smart writing, and abundant laughs. American Reunion also provides plenty of nostalgia for those who grew up with the other American Pie films (The straight to DVD ones don't count though). From references to the infamous pie scene to a parody of the first film's opening, American Reunion never ceases to please fans of the franchise.But this film does not only rely on nostalgic value; it also comes up with its own memorable scenes, such as a hysterical prank scene involving jet-skis and a surprise cameo that the audience at my screening totally loved.I've heard a lot of people, especially critics, complain that this film doesn't offer a lot for newcomers to the franchise. While I do agree that those who have never watched the other films in the franchise will be confused at the inside jokes and references, I think that making the film geared towards newcomers would have been a bad idea. The film is called ""American Reunion"", and I felt that the inside jokes fit well into the ""reunion"" theme. Therefore, I strongly suggest watching at least the first two American Pie films before seeing American Reunion. American Pie 1, 2, and American Wedding are by far some of the best comedy films I've ever seen, and they are definitely worth your time.If you have seen the other films and loved them, I suggest you get down to the theater right away to see this excellent conclusion to a great franchise.",American Reunion

123,The_creator2010,"A brief reunion, A cheap laugh!",5,9 June 2012,"Jim, Stifler and the rest of the gang return for one last gag. A high school reunion.It has been 13 years since the release of what was surely one of the best teen comedies of the late 90s. American Pie was, and still is a classic piece of work. Unfortunately I can't say the same for the sequel nor the ""Wedding"". So what does the latest installment offer? A couple of years have rolled by since Jim accepted ditsy Michelle as his lawfully wedded wife. How times have changed for the virgin slash pie lover. Jim Can't seem to find the time and enjoyment he once experienced as his responsibilities include his very own infant. As we see in the trailer things are not going so well for the couple, both are lacking ambition to please each-others sexual needs.Just like Jim, the rest of the crew have moved on living life as a real adult. A brief reunion between Finch, Oz and Kevin lead to the idea and planning of a high school college reunion. But hey, just like the wedding, don't tell the funniest guy in the movie whats happening, Stifler.So quite obviously Stifler finds out and there you have your attempted comedy as Stifler is once again the genius behind the antics he so forcefully drags his buddies into.Some quite funny scenes involving the now grown men hanging out at beach parties with 16 year old girls etc. There are some nostalgic scenes and some same old material. As always Jim is the victim as he is found embarrassed in some oddly funny circumstances.I laughed my butt off of what clearly seems ridiculous now as I reminisce on its concept. Once again, Stifler is the joker and if anything probably the one tiny excuse the audience will to use to see the latest installment.Unfortunately the film lacks any relation to the word that follows American pie, Reunion? No, far from it. The movie is indeed the same slapstick as the ""wedding"" as it is at least 95 minutes before the audience get to see any of the previous characters.American Pie reunion was a laugh of course but I just wanted to see more of the nostalgic characters like the ""Sherminator"" etc. Instead we got the same old stuff in what seems to become terribly childish and boring. In relation to the previous movie, it is funnier than the wedding (just about) and maybe even Part 2 (its been a while). The chances of you laughing at the stupidity of Jim and Stifler are very high which is genuinely obvious but this reunion is worth one watch only as the future for American pie lies in the past as we will always choose to giggle at the 99"" classic that started it all.I can't help but think the reason behind the latest comedy is the lack of industry work for the cast of the saga. It seems quite obvious as we have really only seen Sean William Scott hit our movie screens with his wacky character ""The Goon"". Unfortunately for most of the cast, American Pie seems the only route available. Although, would you want to see them in anything else? I mean as brilliantly quirky Jason Biggs can be, he has never really warmth to a successful career.So all in all a good time in the cinema as we seem to always enjoy the hilarious consequences and filthy scenes involving a group of guys who some might say, have wanted to be one or two of these egos. I for one wanted to be Finch!Did you enjoy my review? check out my previous and up to date reviews at my blog - http://gerrysreviewsforthosecurious.blogspot.com/",American Reunion
124,antoniomagallon90,So fat the best one in the series,9,6 April 2012,"American Reunion takes place ten years after American Wedding. Jim (Jason Biggs) and Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) have been married for ten years. They have a two year old kid. Kevin Myers (Thomas Ian Nicholas) is also married and is an architect. Oz (Chris Klein) is a sportscaster for ESPN and was a contestant on a dancing reality show (it's another version of Dancing With the Stars). Paul (Eddie Kaye Tomas) is now a traveler and often goes to South America. Stifler (Seann William Scott) works in an office, but stills have attitude problems. Together these groups of friends are going to there high school reunion and are going to have some fun for one weekend, if nothing goes wrong that is. Usually sequels aren't as good as the original due to lack of presentation and rarely do they succeed. American Reunion is one of those rare sequels that work; in fact it is probably the best one in the entire series. For those who grew up watching the series, all of the old crew is back. Stifler is still the same man as before, while everybody else has grown up and that's the good way to introduce the characters that we love. My favorite part about the film is that it shows old school vs. new school generation. Why is that? Because we can relate to that in real life and sometimes, for lack of a better word, it's funny when you think about it. American Reunion is hilarious from the beginning to the end. The sex and drugs humor are back. One thing that is new is how much they try to make it serious than the previous installment and strangely enough it works. How unique is that? For those who never seen any of the American Pie Series (I don't recommend the spin-offs series) you may have a hard time trying to understand the characters personality and the style of the film. For instance there are lots of sex jokes, which the series is known for. Most of the fans will laugh at the jokes but I highly doubt that the newcomers will. So I were you, I would go and watch the whole series in order to understand the structure of the film. Fans of the series will not be disappointed.

126,yamaguchi-victor,Well-behaved American Pie movie,6,28 April 2012,"I don't know – maybe it was just me – but I felt after watching 'American Reunion' that this was the most 'well-behaved' film of the series. We still have a lot of sexual humor and even a scene with male frontal nudity – something that has been becoming quite common nowadays – but everything restricted to certain limits. However, apart from this aspect, it is probably the best film of the series.The studio achieved to reunite all the guys from the first films (Jason Biggs, Sean William Scott) and make a story where they are grown-ups in their thirties and decide to make a high school reunion. As expected, they changed - they aren't willing anymore to lose their virginity or hook-up with the sexy girl from school. Jason Biggs is the family guy who has a weak sexual life with his wife; Sean William Scott is not happy with his life and his career; Eddie Kaye Thomas still doesn't know what he wants from life and Chris Klein is unhappy with his girlfriend. Then, comes the best part of the film – what happen to us after high school? Obviously, the proposal here is not make the audience have a philosophical journey into their past, but treat the issue in a funny way. What we have is an unpretentious flick aimed for the teenage audience – and adults as well. The jokes are not brilliant, but it works – at least for me it did. I had an enjoyable time with 'American Reunion' and if you like this kind of comedies to go to the cinema with your girlfriend/boyfriend then it is the right movie for you.",American Reunion
127,KidDrehmann,Apple Pie Anyone?,10,13 April 2012,"The American Pie series has delivered some of the greatest laughs in recent memory. All starting out with four friends making a pact to lose their virginity and ending with the same four friends, plus one Stifler, rejoining for one last hoorah at their high school reunion. This movie marks the return of the special brand of comedy that we all know and love, and that only this series can provide. With the original cast members' return, American Reunion proves to be just as hilarious as the very first film. I literally almost got a cramp I was laughing so hard. From long awkward talks with dad to taking a dump in a cooler, you are likely to leave the theater in fits of crying laughter, and with everyone saying the same thing: I hope my high school reunion kicks as much ass as this one.",American Reunion
128,mister-green7,don't expect it to be a classic,5,23 May 2012,"I would describe the first three quarters of the film as 'flat'; I mean, we all wish Stifler was as 'crazy' like in the first 3 films, almost like he was 'under the influence' ahem. Here, he acts like he just came out of rehab (maybe he did in real life ahem), so therefore the spark is long gone. However, I really liked the last quarter of the film, and that saved the movie overall, IMHO. The latest American Pie franchise has lost its LOL factor, but was saved by a great ending. I guess I was expecting this to be like the Original Am Pie. Now that flick did packed a lot of PUNCH. I mean, have you seen a guy hump a pie on the big screen? Not me. Hilarious! Thats what missing here. Nonetheless, this is an overall okay flick, as its like a trip down memory lane, with reminders of how times have changed, with new technology (Youtube) and new liberal views (gay marriage).",American Reunion

131,Bmore1984,Weak-age,4,11 October 2012,"Seeing the crew back together was fun. The core characters are still likable, and the actors for the most part deliver. Stifler, like he's done throughout this franchise, nails some genuinely funny moments. The lack of an engaging story was the undoing here. The writers had so much to work with but, unlike the first film, create only a thud. The story lines concerning Oz-Heather and Kevin-Vicky are so much on the back-burner that they become nonexistent. More attention should have been devoted to them. Less on the tiresome plot of Jim and Michelle and their martial problems. Still can't understand why these characters were constantly commingling with high school students. Its was unnecessary and awkward. They're adults now, just like their fanbase, and no one will cry if they party with... ummm... adults.",American Reunion
132,Will_Malone,Back for one final slice of nostalgia,7,29 April 2012,"Once a franchise is onto its 4th film we are normally in trouble. We are either doomed to watch the final death throws of a once great film (both Jaws 4 and Superman IV spring horrifically to mind) or we are into reboot territory, which lets face it never normally ends well (Phantom Menace anyone....). Therefore I wasn't sure what to expect walking into American Reunion. My first slice of Pie was a good experience, however subsequent courses went considerably down hill. A fourth order seemed a little unwise. I needn't have worried though as right from the opening scene it is clear that the original Pie Maker is back. They may be a little older, a little wiser, but they're still just as tasty.The story picks up 13 years since the gang were all at High School, with Jim, Michelle, Oz, Kevin, Finch and Stifler all heading back to East Coast Falls, for their 13th year High School Reunion. Jim and Michelle are now well passed the honeymoon period with a two year old son, Oz is a big time sports presenter with an empty LA lifestyle, Kevin is a struggling architect and house husband, Finch aimlessly travels the world, whilst Stifler is still Stifler but now slightly stifled by working as a temp in the city. Once the boys are back in town the reminiscing begins leading to one last weekend of East Coast Falls escapism and nostalgia.And nostalgia is what we get and we get it in spades. The script feels warm and familiar with some typically amusing and cringe worthy Pie moments, which still feel mange to feel just the right side of fresh (the writers of The Hangover II please take note). The cast are are all on good form and uniformly reprise their roles well. Outside of the main five, all (and I mean all) previous case members are back for one more shot. Some have simply walk on roles, others more substantial, whilst the odd one feels slightly shoe-horned in. At one point there were so many of them showing up that I thought there is probably a good drinking game in the making here. Special mention needs to be made though of Eugene Levy (Jim's Dad) and Jennifer Coolidge (Stifler's Mum) who were both stand out excellent. In fact Levy has never been better, especially in the last act.The majority of the audience in the screening I attended were in their mid thirties, so would have been late teenagers when the first slice of Pie was served up. There is a lot here that the audience could relate to. We have all attended (or avoided) high school reunions, we have all stalked ex-partners on Facebook (admit it of course you have) and all ultimately been forced to face up to the reality and responsibilities of adult life. There was a strong sense of empathy in the air during certain scenes.I had fun with American Reunion, and if I am to be honest, more than I was expecting. It was by no means perfect and occasionally the script felt slightly forced and lacking in focus, but these were brief moments and forgivable considering the company we are in. Whilst it was nice to spend a couple of hours with these characters again, I did come away with a slight nagging concern. This franchise will be the high water mark for 90% of this cast and whilst Jason Biggs, Alison Hannigan and Sean William Scott are doing OK, you must wonder about the others. If no more Pie is to be served, then what will be their next course?",American Reunion
133,drewfp,The Best One Yet!,10,14 April 2012,I just got back from seeing this movie and i am so glad that i did. i am a huge American pie fan and fans will not be disappointed. this movie brings back everything you loved from the first movies and it is just soo awesome and it was worth the wait. all of your favorite characters are back and better than ever and the storyline is great along with some very clever and outrageously clever scenes. Another thing i loved about this movie was that not only was it true to the original in bringing it all back but it totally bashes this generation and kids today along with facebookers and current music. i strongly recommend that everyone goes to see it because you will wet yourself laughing and walk out of there with a big painful smile on your face.,American Reunion
134,julesrulesny,I nearly gave this movie a 10...,9,26 June 2012,"I often wonder why people don't like the same movies that I do - Is it me? Do I have a weird sense of humor? Just a different take on things? Do I just get too nostalgic and think every movie I see is good? Maybe a little of each b/c I do like many movies I see.. even bad ones, knowing they are bad but I still like them..Having said that - this is not a bad movie at all. In fact, I'm pleasantly surprised at how good it was!! Boy did it bring back so many good memories of that time period. See, I graduated High school and went to college in the late 90's, early 2000s. And these were by far the best days of my life. Tho I often reminisce with my friends about how much fun we had well into the 2000's, but it was this period from 1998-2002 which was surely the best. As after we all graduated college in 2000, most of us(except me) got married, had kids, etc.. and this was right when American Pie 1 and 2 were released during this ""fun stage"" in my life. Kind of like how ""Stifler"" is stuck in the past? Well, I guess so am I! Haha.So, I could be biased as many of the jokes were indeed the same but well done.. (The next sentence does contain spoilers so be forewarned..) Especially the very end when Stifler gets with Finch's Mom! Talking about Karma and everything coming full circle!! I thought it was terrific. Funny movie, even some moving sentiment as well..But the laughs were good and kept me entertained. And, I thought everyone looked great! Even Tara Reid as some have knocked her but she did look hot. As did Mena Suvari and these up and newcomers ""Ali Corbin"" who played the role of Kara and ""Katrina Bowden"" who played Mia. Always nice to see familiar and new faces in a movie..I didn't give it a 10 b/c 10 out of 10 should be held for the best of the best like Shawshank, Braveheart, Goodfella's, etc.. But a 9 for a comedy in the 4th installment is not only well deserved, it goes to show that sequel's can be well worth it and popular! Especially for people my age now getting close to middle age as some may call it..(yuk! phooey! spat! ugh!) LoL!",American Reunion
135,josh_youngbwfc,American Reunion Delights Old Fans,7,15 June 2012,"It's been nine years since we last saw Jim and the gang on the big screen, and to fill the pie shaped gap in their lives die hard fans of the series were forced to endure the awful awful sequels that were being made, although by the time Book of Love was made I'm not sure anyone was bothering to watch anymore. But now, in 2012 fans have what they want: a new sequel, the rightful continuation of the original trilogy however there is a problem; with new comedy hits like The Hangover and 21 Jump Street is there still room in the comedy genre for Jim, Finch, Kevin, Oz and Stifler?The basic premise of the film is pretty much said in the title. American Reunion is the story of the class of 99 from East Great Falls having a high school reunion back in their home towns and as it seems, this is the first time that the gang have got together properly since leaving school. But back in East Great Falls relationship are put to the test as romantic interests, both old and new, force a few characters to think about their adult lives.The main cast are all back for this: Jason Biggs, Alyson Hannigan, Chris Klein, Thomas Ian Nicholas, Sean William Scott, Eddie Kay Thomas and even John Cho, Chris Owen and Shannon Elizabeth return for the final slice of pie. Because of this the film takes a while to get going as the audience have to be re-introduced to the characters and their modern lives. Fortunately, the opening scene featuring Jim and Michelle's relationship is pretty funny and does well to set up the tone of the film.Fans of the original trilogy are bound to enjoy this new addition; there are plenty of old jokes referenced throughout the duration of American Reunion and there are, of course, plenty of new jokes and antics from Stifler that are sure to get the audience laughing. A few of the jokes do fall flat on their feet but most of the comedy elements shine and are divided well throughout the film.As well as the great comedy turns there are also some touching and really nice moments between the couples and this balance of light heartedness and relationship themes really helps the characters come alive and it's wonderful to see how these people's lives have changed while we haven't been watching. This is the first film featuring the original characters not to be written by Adam Herz (instead being written by Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg) but the new writers manage to capture the old essence of the characters really well.American Reunion probably wouldn't look that great as a stand alone film, but as a sequel to the already hilarious trilogy it works brilliantly, providing plenty of nostalgia and familiarity for audiences everywhere. Whilst it is likely that American Reunion may get another sequel providing it does well at the box office I feel like this should be the end. The end of the film seems like a natural conclusion for the gang and I don't think there is much else that we can follow the characters doing. This would be a perfect way to go out.",American Reunion
136,travsta_92,Couldn't have asked for a better reunion!,8,24 March 2013,"I would have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this film from beginning to end. Now, of course this is a bias opinion coming from an immense fan of the series. Although I just couldn't help but be impressed with how well the reunion turned out and here is exactly why I think this:It was a very great move to have professional writers that were already passionate fans of the series get on board for the reunion. It perfectly depicts the concept of growing up and the realization of where their lives have become at the age of 30. There are a lot of sequels these days that end up just trying to rehash what the original possessed but offering nothing further. Thus I was very pleased that American Reunion presented as a tremendous movie in it's own right whilst having everything that made the first 2 movies lovable and providing a lot of interesting story lines that make plenty of room for great jokes and heart felt moments.All in all I highly recommend anyone watch the movie. I understand that some people have different opinions and have certain boundaries when it comes to gross-out humor but I definitely think the heart felt moments certainly outweigh the rest while still being wildly hilarious and clever. It is a brilliant nostalgic throwback that provides everything that you would have wanted as a fan of the franchise.",American Reunion

138,rcwells86,"Good funny comedy, to much political correctness",6,29 June 2012,"I loved 80% of the movie, it had great scenes that made me laugh out loud which is something I rarely do in comedy's anymore. So that was a breath of fresh air, the acting was excellent with all the original actors from the first three movies returning. The storyline progressed very smoothly and ended well with Stifler getting a good much needed revenge at the end! That all said there was just way to much political correctness for my liking. There were at least three different gay couples in the film and the filmmakers went out of their way not to do any jokes at their expense. Even Stifler had to bite his tongue to be politically correct in a scene which he obviously would have still made a joke about. So they twisted his character to fit in with this scene(and one at the end).Overall though a great movie, I just wish Hollywood writers would stop trying to stuff their views down the movie lovers throats.",American Reunion
139,Mike_Fen,A funny trip to where it all began!,8,24 April 2012,"Throughout the year the American Pie franchise has dished out several sequels and spin offs. Most of these films were entertaining, but failed to compare with the original.After a while it became evident that the franchise was concerned with prolonging the inevitable fading of the original title. This is where American Reunion differed from all the rest. American Reunion serves as a stand alone film, worthy of its accolades. This film was able to bridge the gap back to the first film, while borrowing and indirectly implying to the events that occurred in the previous sequels; all while remaining its own film. One could have never seen any of the other films, including the original, to understand and appreciate the story, characters, and humor of the film. It was pleasing to see the original characters, as well as, other minor roles that made the films memorable. American Reunion is, as its title implies, a reunion with a lost art. The teen comedy at its finest. Overall, it was like reuniting with old friends and picking up where you last left off. It is worth watching, even if you haven't seen the original.",American Reunion
140,sa8713,alright,8,25 October 2012,"While I was not laughing till my guy hurt like I'm normally doing for these movies, it still had a lot of good parts. It was nice to see how everyone grew up and that most of them were still up to the same old nonsense. Part of me wished that Stifler would have grown up a little bit, because personally he always just bugged the heck out of me. Some parts were a little to predictable, like, of course the fact chick in high school lost a bunch of weight and looks incredible now, and it only would happen in the movies that the girl you used to babysit wants you to be her first and then you say nothing about the whole thing to your wife!! I recommend this movie to anyone who has seen the American pie movies, or at least one of them. Its still a good laugh.",American Reunion
141,jon-larsen,Great film!,9,12 April 2012,"I RARELY like teen films but the first American Pie film was excellent, the second one was OK and American Wedding was awful thanks to Stifler. I was worried how the characters would be and especially Stifler because he was overplaying in American Wedding, but he turned out to be one of the best character in the film! It is hard to say who the best character was because pretty much everyone were excellent!All the guys had balanced screen time which I liked and even Jim's Dad had a big role, and a good one too! I somehow felt like this film was a satire of the new generation, but a good and hilarious satire!Overall, this film was extremely hilarious throughout and an absolute delight! If you liked the first American Pie, you will definitely like this one too, but watch it in the cinema. It is worth it!I don't know if it was because of the nostalgia of seeing all the actors from the first film again or if it was because of the great scripted and fresh film, but I gave this film a 9/10. Could have been higher, but some parts were a bit disappointing, for example Jessica's and Nadia's cameos!",American Reunion
142,Nesvrstani,I did not expect this.,10,10 April 2012,"First of, let me say that, this review comes from a guy that has seen 30 minutes of the first and original American Pie like, 7-8 years ago, and the rewatched the whole movie a few days ago. So, basically, I knew the characters at a minimal amount before watching ''The Reunion''.I'll try and make this as short and as sweet as possible. I gave it a 10. Why? Because it's simply fantastic. I pretty much have a good opinion on the first original movie, so I expected something very similar to that, but I got more then I could've wanted. It's fresh, it's original, it's brutal in some points (in a good way), and all the original characters return, which is, after seeing those guys 13 years ago in the first part (that I watched a few days ago again) get together on the big screen after all that time, is really amazing and heart warming.Really, and honestly, go and see it. It's fantastic. Again, I'm not the biggest fan ever, and I have pretty high and specific taste in comedy (as it is my favorite genre) and am considered the Finch by my group of friends - even I gave this movie a 10/10. No flaws at all. Absolutely none.",American Reunion
143,thegoods7,They're back!,9,11 April 2012,This movie was definitely a good idea by the directors. if you haven't seen the first American pies I highly suggest you do before you watch this one. everyone you would remember from the first pie is back. the whole gang comes back for their class reunion and once again some things have changed but some have not. stifler is still stifler and everyone else has done something better with their life. this movie still has the humor that the first three had and still makes you laugh. even though it has the humor it still has the heart that the first three had. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone but it would be a good idea to watch the first three first to know the stories behind the characters.,American Reunion
144,destroyah25,a great addition to the series,8,9 April 2012,"Gotta say for starters that I was surprised at the quality of this film. I was 13 when the original came out, and just starting high school so it was kind of my generations teen sex comedy film. The second was also solid and then kind of faltered in the 3rd one. The film did an excellent job in reliving some of the classic moments of the series without rehashing the same ideas over again. It def brought back many memories watching the film. The plot was pretty standard and the comedy was great throughout the film. I really enjoyed the character development on how they had progressed the characters through the years. It also was awesome to see Stifler back to true form, and the scenes with Jim's dad and Stifler's mom were great. I also enjoyed how they brought back feelings from their old high school relationships. Another great thing was the small but nice roles of Nadia and Sherman. All in all this is probably tied with the original for best in the series and is a must watch for any who have seen the original trilogy 8/10",American Reunion
145,Oliver-S-K,Better than everything after part 1,7,25 April 2012,"Over a decade has passed, since the kids from East Great Falls graduated from high school. The old gang rarely got to see each other and their lives went on. Some are married, some are living their dream and everyone has their own problems. Jim (Jason Biggs) and Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) have a son now, who makes them happy, but on the downside, the bed is only used for sleeping. Oz (Chris Klein) is quite famous for being the host of a sports show and participating in a dance contest, Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) a loving husband, Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) is a globetrotter and of course, there's Steve Stifler (Seann William Scott) who hasn't changed a bit. Everyone is glad to be back together and they try to catch up, while also reliving their high school days.They're back. And yes, they really did get most of the cast back, even the side characters. Unfortunately they didn't really learn to act in all those years, but then again, no one is watching American Pie for the high-quality acting. The characters have developed, but haven't really matured. Some gags are good, some are not that good or a bit stupid, while others are tasteless. For example, I really didn't need to see Jason Biggs' dong, the joke would've even worked without it. And that's one of the things I never liked about the American Pie franchise. They have some quite good and funny parts, but blow it with grossy grade-school and/or fecal humour. But I have to admit, the movie isn't that bad. Well, at least it's way better than everything else that came after the first movie (which isn't that hard, because everyone was worse than the predecessor). And here's the controversy about the tightrope walk they had to do with this movie. They want to get back all the old fans of the movies, which should've grown out of this kind of movies, while also pleasing the new generation of movie goers, who want that kind of humour. So we have all the ""old"" characters/actors, who are familiar to the old fan base, while targeting the humour of today's teenagers. And I have to admit, they do this actually quite well. So yeah, if you're an old fan, you can get a bit nostalgic and won't be disappointed by American Reunion. And if you're young and new to the franchise, you can have a good time as well. But if haven't seen an American Pie movie before, you should at least watch the first movie, to get to know the characters, since they don't get much of an introduction. And if you don't like American Pie, this movie won't make you love it, since it's basically the same old stuff.",American Reunion

That's what i felt watching American Reunion.Having no attachments and emotions at all towards the series you could go ""oh well, that's stupid"" and rate it about a 5 or even 4 if you're expecting Shakespeare.But I'm 23 now, and grew up with the first 3 movies, and really every single character is given a funny moment as is being brought back to screen.

All the original cast returning was the most important part of the film. It's still fitting for our generation. It's also fitting for the newer generation. Stifler still had his gags and they were absolutely hilarious and I'm so glad Stifler still had it in him. No plot holes. The new characters were very well added in. Spoiler:Stifler, he's the man. Michelle, whoa she's all grown up. She's not nerdy anymore. Seeing her attitude being matured kinda a let down but seeing that it was a good thing for Jim's character, it had Jim making mistakes and seeing that was great! Sad to see that Jim's mom has passed. But seeing that Jim's Dad and Stilfer's mom hitting off was a surprise. Very well scripted. Finch's mom was another surprise. A MILF also. She was as horny as Stifler's mom which made it hilarious for Stilfer to get laid. Very well scripted too and good timing. Talk about bad karma for Finch. No plot holes. They mention Oz breaking up with Heather. Although they didn't mention how Jim's mom passed but they at least mention she passed so we can know why she's not in the movie besides her being in the video they were watching. Finches mom was a big surprise for me. Along side Jim's dad and Stifler's mom. Even though the trailer hinted that out.",American Reunion

I think they all played their role pretty good, although Finch was a bit off in some scenes where he kind of smiles where he shouldn't and so on. Overall good performance from all actors.But I must say, I was completely blown away by Stifmeisters performance in this movie. It was just phenomenal!! He reminds me of only one genius comedian that is the best in the world, Jim Carrey. He might not have been at his level, but not far from it! Just amazing! I laughed so many times at his little fake laughst to agree with people although his character didn't, and his facial gestures.A must see! Long live the Stifmeister! Hope to see him in many different comedys from now on, he made this film great instead of just watchable!On a side note, I will rename myself to Stifmeister no joke.

This is decent entertainment, not high art.What makes this franchise strong after three sequels is a 1)funny concepts; 2) likable characters (many of the people in the film are like people I associated with in high school and college); 3) good actors; and 4) decent scripts.Another sequel after this?

152,cooper-station,American Reunion- They did it!,9,27 February 2020,"American Pie felt like high school. American Pie 2 felt like college. American Wedding felt like all the fun was over, and American Reunion felt....... Awesome! Whats the point of a reunion? To see the boys again? To reminisce? To recapture those old feelings? American Reunion delivered! On all three levels. After the funny but ""the party is over"" feeling of American Wedding, I never would have imagined that the crew would reunite, much less deliver a good film. Well they delivered a great film. I didn't see the American Pie films until after high school, but I can only imagine that teens from the late 90's/early 00s heading to the theater to see American Reunion. While it would be a bit of a stretch to call this film as much of a classic as the first, hence the 9 of 10 rating, it completely recaptures the essence of the first film. The cast reunites like they never left the set. All of the chemistry is still there, the heart is still there, and the jokes and grossness are still as fresh and funny as ever. After American Wedding, one could rightfully argue that the franchise was over, other than the useless spinoffs. After this film, I wouldn't mind seeing the franchise head all the way to the retirement home. East Great Falls Class of 99 forever!",American Reunion

Its really nice to see the known characters of same ages are growing up, facing similar problems, finding love, making mistakes and making up for those in the way I have. The script is believable and not a lot of sugar coating has been made in order to make this movie watch-able.Since American wedding all of the American pie movies are jerk feasts while this one is a fresh breath in the air. The most lovable character yet is Stifler and the writers made his presence worthy. Jim is still getting the same kind of advice from his father.

Now about the movie;first of all i must say that KARA is f***ing hot.She provides as much the sensuality as was provided by NADIA in the first movie if not more and some nice piece of body she has. Anyways,moving on,STIFFLER,my favorite character is great as usual.SEAN WILLIAM SCOT has been good in all the American pie movies he has been and playing the character of a Dumbass and a D*** suits him best.As in JIM'S words ""YOU MIGHT BE A D*** BUT YOU ARE OUR D*** "" Jim as always gets himself into funny situations and you will get to see a lot more of him,ahem.... lots more.

155,manostheodosis,Back to basics.,10,8 September 2014,"The American Pie franchise accompanied generations of teens through their teenage years, and for a good portion of us, it was the first time we saw nudity. I still remember coming home from the video club, going straight up to my room and locking the door, just so my folks wouldn't freak out. American Pie was the movie that started the whole American/romance/comedy genre. And then it turned sour. Yeah, we were excited with American Pie, we loved American Pie 2. We sat through American Wedding. On Band Camp, well, that didn't lived up to our expectations. Naked Mile was kind of an improvement, but still. Then came the Beta House. That kinda reminded the first few, but it was still lacking something. And then it hit us. The Book of Love. Damn. If I could undo watching a movie, Book of Love would definitely be it. What a tremendous pile of garbage that movie was. Most of us thought that this was it, our beloved series would end like that.But, thankfully, someone felt the need to redeem themselves, and voilà, American Reunion was made. It's everything the first movies were, and even more! It sports the original cast, the original hilarious moments and has the same old ""feel"". I know I mentioned the cast, but it also has the original Stifler. A must watch for anyone who loved the first few movies and/or grew up in the nineties.",American Reunion
156,jroyce1-144-759442,Some slices missing from this Pie,7,10 April 2012,"Before I begin this review, I would like to introduce myself as a fellow generation Y alum who graduated around the same time as the Pie gang did.I would also like to state that I laughed almost continuously throughout the entire film. As a comedy, this film succeeds ,but as a complete movie, there are definitely some slices missing from this pie.American Reunion is a valuable entry into the American Pie series. It accurately nails down the plight of those in their late 20s and early thirties by giving every character something different to struggle with;loss of romantic attraction in marriage, children, unsavory-bosses, failing relationships, death, and most of all, nostalgia for simpler times.Every character handles this nostalgia differently, some in more adult fashion that others. The movie is in fact a series of intertwining vignettes that consist of the development of Jim, Kevin, Oz, Finch, and of course, Stiffler. Of all the stories, I thought that Jim and Finch had the most developed stories, while Kevin's fell flat, and Oz's was rather predictable. Although Stiffler was still his familiar over-the-top self, he shows a sad side, and struggles with growing up probably more-so than any other character. As far as performance goes, Eugene Levy as Jim's Dad steals the movie while performing some of the best drunk-acting I have seen in years.On the flip side, Chris Klein as Oz is predictably pitiful, and Alsyon Hannigan gives a very uncharacteristically bland and un-peppy performance. She looks and acts like she is in her early 40s rather than early 30s.The reunion aspect of the movie is rather forced on the audience, with bit characters like Jessica, Sherman being jammed in at the very end. I was disappointed that Nadia didn't make more of an appearance in the movie, and I believed the story line could have included her character much more. Overall, the story is incredibly basic, but the characters are believable and real, providing many laughs and plenty of nostalgia right down to the music and a note from Stiffler that ""Cell Phones didn't even exist when I last pulled this"". I believe the movie will hit home the most with those of us whose lives are at almost the same point as the Pie gang.Blink 182 once did a song called ""Dammit"" with the refrain, ""I guess this is growing up."" They should have a new song that goes ""I guess this is being a grown up."" If only the American Reunion gang could get together every 5-10 years to do hysterical takes on how life progresses; I think many people would be appreciative.",American Reunion
157,FilmPhreeks,The Boys Are Back In Town!,9,7 April 2012,"Alright. So, it's been 13 years since the first American Pie movie and in this movie, we see the characters from the original trilogy coming back together and having their high school reunion. Now, let me start by saying that I loved the first 3 American Pie movies when they had came out and I was only about 7 years old when the first one came out. When I watched them, I got it's appeal with the gross-out humor and the funny situations the characters get themselves in. To me, my favorite characters out of all those movies were Steve Stifler, played by Sean William Scott, and Jim's dad Noah, played by Eugene Levy. Every single time I would see them on screen, I would laugh out loud hard and really be into what's going on. Now granted, the 3rd movie went a little too overboard with Stifler, but, I still liked it for what it was. It's really surprising how they've made all those Direct-To-DVD spin-offs of American Pie, but they couldn't even get the original cast besides Jim's Dad. Now, back to American Reunion. I really liked this movie. It had a lot of nostalgic value going for it, the gross-out humor had some really great laughs going on and I was just really glad to see the original cast come back together and have a good time. Though, they pretty much retain the same personalities they did in the other movies, it's just always a delight seeing the situation they get themselves into and there's a part where Stifler takes a dump inside these jocks' beer cooler for payback after they insulted him and the other guys at this beach and it was hilarious. And another thing I really enjoyed was seeing how Jim's dad gets drunk and proceeds to get high with Stifler's mom and there's a scene at the very end of the movie, and I wont spoil what happens, but, it made me crack up so much at the theater I almost rolled over the ground laughing so hard. Final thoughts: I really enjoyed this movie. It had a lot of great moments, the characters are still fleshed out pretty well, including Jim, Oz, Finch, Kevin, Stifler, Jim's Dad, Michelle, Vicki, and Heather, and seeing them coming back after 13 years really left a smile on face and when I heard the music they were playing at the reunion party, it made me kind of miss being in the 90s too. So, I'd recommend the movie. It's a hell of a lot better than those Direct to DVD spinoffs that I don't even think is in the same continuity as the other movies. So, yeah, if you're drunk or at a party or just want a good time, this is the movie for you. I liked it.",American Reunion

Life change .. even if you want it to be like old times .. but it isn't , no matter how hard you try to bring back a nostalgia . were not the same person as we were back then , and these high school /college party will never be the same . You cant fully recapture that moment anymore . i think this is what i liked about this movie , the show us the truth of what life is when your older . i really feel what the characters felt in the movie . Now if you watch American pie when you were 8-9 and your now 20-21 , you might not fully get what the characters lived and understand how they feel ( no offense there ) , but if your about the same age as the characters in the movies ( in the beginning of your 30's ) , you'll understand how they feel. specially when they get at the beach with the 18 y.o crowd and feel like they don't fit in , i totally understand how they felted cause it happen to me more than once . It's a whole new generation . Like i said , there's a few humor parts that are nice, but overall , the human touch and hitting the point right about what you feel as an adult in early 30's . I'm class of 1998 . my 10 years reunion was 2 years ago . so its been 12 years since the first American pie so i really connected with the characters as i'm their age . great movie .. bring back nostalgia and i think hit the spot about how guys feel in their late 20's early 30's . its not for everyone that expect toilet humor ( although their is some but not much ) . but its a nice movie if you like the originals 1-2-3 .this end the series very well .",American Reunion

The film avoids any potential fertile ground for moving these characters along. The wedding instalment capped these characters off. Hence the ludicrous amount of shite that followed sporting the title. The central themes for each person haven't changed in the slightest. Its two hours of dick/fart jokes without a character to care about or root for. They haven't grown up at all. Its as if the writers have decided this film is set the following week of the previous events. Bizarre.The performances are middle of the road and you can almost see the pain in Sean William- Scotts eyes as he grits his way through. Most support cast do return in a ""oh look its me"" kinda way, great if you like that type of thing.Its sounds like I hated it, so why not a lower score? Because I actually enjoyed the series. I liked the characters and still have some love for them. I laughed a few times and to be fair Eugene levy's popcorn scene killed me. It just wasn't enough.

While American Reunion may hold some novelty for those that only saw the initial installment or none at all, bar the opening sequence, there's not a lot we haven't seen before. Jim gets himself into an awkward situation - check. Stifler is obnoxious but ultimately 'redeems' himself - check. We ponder whether Oz and Heather will end up together at the end of the movie - check. Ultimately somebody bangs somebody's mother - check. Its all there. It has it's moments but for the most part it feels flat and, at 1 hr 54 minutes it is the longest in the series. New characters are hastily introduced then things drag out a little as the guys reunite before rushing through the cameos, including one of the main characters from the first two films, towards the end. I enjoyed the film but, next to American Pie 2, to me it is the weakest In the series. The biggest surprise is none of the boys comment on Vicky's new knockers and, of course, with the core female cast getting on a bit the writer/directors found a way to work in the nubile young flesh of a girl who, we are led to believe, developed a crush on Jim when he was babysitting her when she was, what, 4?I also wondered if Facebook co-produced the movie as pretty much every major character name-dropped the social networking site at least once.I give the film an extra mark for Rebecca De Mornay's appearance as Finch's mom and her call back to the classic Risky Business",American Reunion

Watching this movie was so nostalgic, and actually my reunion was in this summer (unfotunately not as awesome as in the movie), so i can totally feel what they felt. One big party to remember to the old times. About the movie - usually i am very critical, but in the Reunion i cant really find any weak point. Maybe the only thing i can mention is the nudity, that was unnecessary. But the story was great, the humor was perfect. I could enjoy every moment of the movie, and it was great to see how the guys changed over the years. There is no stop, you cant even blink, because you could miss something great.

The first 3 were great. After them it was a destruction. Lame jokes, total change of cast, lame acting, lame story. I was very disappointed at American Pie, until the Reunion. Not only the crazy classic gang is back, but they're the same crazy freaks as in the first 3. I don't wanna talk about the plot, because let's face it, we don't watch American Pie for it's plot :P , but i think that the cast is brilliant, Sean William Scott is more awesome than ever and Alyson Hannigan proves that she can play better roles than Lily in How I met your mother !!!If you want to laugh until you cry, you have to watch this!!!",American Reunion
166,mickeypowell,Just What I've Been Waiting For! :),10,2 May 2012,"Finally, after so many years of putting up with so many of Stifler's cousin's, brother's, nephew's or whatever! I'd just like to say, kudos to those that have tried but there is and will only ever will be ONE Stifmeister! I was actually 9 when American Pie first came out. Couldn't believe it myself. So, at a pretty young age, I was coming out with all these explicit one liner's from the movies, and 13 years later they just haven't worn off. Still use them in conversation's. It's just pure comedy that will never die... The spin off's almost killed them, but I have never really included them as American Pie films. For me, it will always be Jim, Kev, Oz, Stifler and Finch. They are my heroes! After seeing the Reunion I have another hero! Noah Levenstein! What a dark horse. He has always been the awkward dad popping up in the most awful situations but wth, he has completely emerged out of his shell and became this awesomely funny character. I was pretty much wetting myself watching him come out with these amazing one liner's, and getting himself into some tricky predicaments. :) The relationship between the gang has not changed one bit from the first one over ten years ago which was absolutely brilliant to see. It was nice to see Chris Klein back in it. It has the same genius plots that were there in the first three movies. They get into trouble. There's still a lot of horniness in the film, even though most of them are married or in a relationship. The table's have turned for poor Ole' Stifler, he seems to be a bit of a loser in this movie, but it totally works. He is still perfect. His face expressions and little giggle's won me over throughout the whole thing. I have to say, as much as I love the American Pie film's, this one is without a doubt the best of the bunch. Please do not let the hundred spin-off's put you off because this is the real American Pie we all grew up with and fell in love with all those years ago. A big fat 10/10 from me.

169,thebrow88,Everything seems to have wrapped up in a neat little package,8,20 April 2012,"I must say, I thoroughly enjoyed this one. It was a nice recovery from the train wreck that was American Wedding.We begin with Jim the father, Oz the celebrity, Kevin the housewife, Finch the wild adventurer, and Stifler the office bitch. Everyone was about where we would expect them to be.Jim and Michelle are having some bedroom issues, and it's a nice callback to how they originally became close.Oz comes back to town with his wild, experimenting girlfriend, only to run into his old girlfriend, Heather. This story kind of bothered me, because the audience was never told how or when Oz and Heather broke up. In fact, I remember watching deleted scenes from American Pie 2, and the writers were almost going to break them up, but they decided not to, because they were the solid, loving couple. I think they made these two break up in between just so they could tell the story of them reuniting. But then again, why not use that story with Kevin and Vicky? Too predictable? Kevin comes back for the reunion as basically a house husband. He cooks, cleans and takes care of his wife, who we don't really get to know. I was hoping to get to know her a little bit more so that we could know who it was that wound up replacing Vicky. But watching a troubled Kevin wake up with no clothes next to Vicky was a great twist. And to see Kevin stand up for himself and his new relationship was pretty heartwarming.Finch came off as this deep, world-traveling, motorcycle riding badass, but I could smell lies from a mile away. Not once (that I remember anyway) did he mention how he got the money to do the things he did. Alas, I was right, and it turns out his stories were all fake. But in the end, he wound up with a heavyset-turned-gorgeous band geek, and finally got the love he deserved.Stifler...was still Stifler. I'd have to say this was one of my favorite Stifler performances. You could tell he was a lot more jumpy and energetic. It would make sense that all of his antics were building up over the time he spent working for the dickhead boss of his. The one thing that disappointed me was how well he told off his boss at the end. I was expecting a lot more than just insulting the size of his penis.Oh yeah, and I was a bit upset that they kinda recycled the idea of everyone turning on Stifler, and then he winds up coming through. Boring.Btw, brilliant performances by John Cho (Asian MILF guy) and Eugene Levy (Jim's dad). It was nice to see Nadia, Sherman and Jessica, but I feel like they were very last minute additions, and didn't add much fun to the reunion scenes.All in all, it was nice to see these actors together again. Tara Reid was finally hot again, and Mena Suvari became quite attractive. Alyson Hannigan has been losing some of her luster, but she's still got a bit of fire.",American Reunion
170,reversedthepolarity,"Reclaiming the glory of the previous good instalments, a great if touch flawed entry",8,23 May 2012,"American Pie is such a popular franchise, it stands out from most of the terrible sex gags and crude humour you see in most teen movies these days, what separates this from the rest of them is the underlying tone of innocence and likability. Out of all of the crude gags and sexual antics, there's something genuine and honest about it that catches the audience, this is down to the characters. Although not all of them are particularly good (Oz being the main example) they all work as cogs in a machine interacting with each other in a way that always makes the audience and fan base laugh. It's the definition of a fun movie about crude subjects done right. The first film was a classic and stands up by modern standards, it's even in a sense funnier now than before because of how dated it sometimes seems. The second is pretty much the same but different sequel, however unlike most sequels (The Hangover being one of them) it does what good sequels do, it expands on the characters and makes them products of the first film going into the second and actually develops them further (the Empire Strikes Back is another example of this). The third was unnecessary and weak (particularly the overuse of Stifler) but had a few laughs. The straight to DVD spin off's were all awful, turning the franchise into something that it used to separate itself from (that being the terrible crude teen movies referred to previously), Eugene Levy's talent was misused in most of them. The first and foremost decision that was made in this one was ignoring the spin off's like they never happened, already a step in the right direction, the second was toning down Stifler and making him the Greek chorus he was in the first two, while still providing the laughs. American Reunion's first and foremost achievement is getting the original characters SPOT ON, even improving on some of them, Jim is Jim, his Dad is his Dad, Kevin, Oz, Finch, Stifler, Michelle e.t.c are all their characters from the original and more, the new writer and director know these character and portray them with great success. Oz (who I previously stated I didn't like all that much) is given more to do character wise in this one, he satires the cheesiness of a lot of celebrity personalities in a way that was genuinely clever, it showed how much society has progressed and measures the differences between the original films and today, and Chris Klein is pretty good at portraying that aspect. The second achievement is the humour, this is the first time in a while that an understanding of what makes American Pie so great is explored to it's full potential, what makes American Pie funny isn't the sex gags or gross out humour, it's their characters and their interplay with the situation they are faced with, the awkwardness of Jim and his dad discussing sex is funny because it is both as much cringe worthy as it is touching. The gross out humour is minimised in this one, I believe this is a good decision as it shows the maturing nature of most of the characters.The negative aspects of the film are the new story and new characters, it doesn't feel like any new or memorable characters were added to this instalment, others in the Pie series gave us new characters that were memorable, in this one all the new editions seem very much like shoe horned plot devices to serve a quota, Oz's and Heather's other halves were written as bad apples from the start, so everyone knew they'd just get back together in the end, same goes to the love interest for Finch, although it was satisfying seeing Finch finally get into a proper relationship, the character portrayed wasn't that memorable. Same goes for the Kara (a girl Jim used to baby sit) sub plot and her boyfriend which seems to come across as generic opposition for the sake of it, the new characters feel more like people you'd see in the spin off's as main characters as oppose to the genuine characters of the original. However the plot and new characters isn't what the audience came to see, or the focal point of the film, which is why this can be forgiven. The film as a whole is great, it provides a great nostalgia factor for the fans and lovers of this kind of comedy, the original cast do a great job even if some are there as cameos (I'm just grateful they got all the main ones back) the funniest aspect of this film is the second act with Jim's dad, everything from the online dating montage to the Stifler's mum sequence is comedy gold thanks to Levy, not to mention some genuinely touching character moments when it comes to his wife and her passing away, it puts a different spin on the relationship with Jim and is packed full of heart. I recommend this film to anyone who likes the series or this kind of comedy. But I do warn people that it is made for the fans, so if you find yourself confused due to not watching the previous films, then you may not like it, at least watch the first 3 (or 2 as the 3rd is unnecessary to this one) before seeing this one, if you do you'll love it as much as I did.",American Reunion
171,laktu2,Terrible movie if you haven't seen the others.,4,6 April 2012,"Growing up, I was never interested in watching raunchy comedies and R rated movies. As I grew older however, they became more and more interesting to me. I am here to review this movie as nobody else can, seeing as how everyone I talked to has seen at least one other American Pie movie. This is a terribly done movie ONLY if you have not seen any of the others. Sitting through this I was bored to tears and hardly laughing at all. I am told that this is because I haven't seen the others and didn't understand the jokes since they all reference previous incidents. The first time the gang was together on screen, I thought that Stiffler was the antagonist, trying to tear everyone apart. In order for a movie to work, I think that you shouldn't have to see the other movies in a series in order to understand the current one. I think that they should all be original and introduce characters in their own way instead of relying on the audience to automatically understand them. That being said, everyone else I have talked to said it was just as good as the original, so if you have seen the other American Pies, go see this movie.

After American Pie;The Wedding, the following films were disappointing, so was glad to see the original cast was returning. I was a little worried they would not be able to match the first three films, but I couldn't have been more wrong. From the very beginning, the scene is set, ensuring hilarity and ""dirty"" jokes galore. The characters, even Stifmeister, are very likable and endearing. (With the exception of a smug boss and Heather's boyfriend). We learn that Jim's mother passed away and there is a fab subplot where Jim and Michelle are trying to cheer up Jim's dad, ending in a meeting with the infamous ""Stifler's Mon""! We also learn that Jim and Michelle are having marital difficulties and trying to rekindle their non existent sex life. Stifler has still not grown up, though the ending of the film for him was a stroke of genius in my eyes, and I did not see the resulting union coming at all. All the characters bar Jim's mother have a part, some larger than others, and all of them look fantastic, especially Chris Ostreicher! I only watched this movie yesterday and I already want to watch it again. There were many genuine laugh out loud moments, including a funny scene involving a see through pan lid.......... Give it a go, if you are a fan of the first installments, I am sure you will love this.

The movie had also introduced some old romances as one would except and a few surprises throughout the film. The ending was good and left me with a laugh and wanting to see another American Movie...Overall i recommend this film. It was really funny.",American Reunion
174,tuberjonas,If your story isn't the best... Put some half naked girls in it and no one will care.,7,15 May 2012,"Yep, 7/10... A movie with an easy concept: some old friends, acting like sexist teens, being drunk almost the whole movie (except when they're driving) and doing dumb things all the time. Sounds quite good to me :D I know people who just can't handle the dry humor and cheap story, but you know, let them watch saddle club or something... If you have a social life that sounds better than that and you have uncontrollable impulses of going to the cinema with them, consider watching American Reunion. Not a slow or complicated movie, just the crazyness and crappy jokes are prizing this movie. Interested? - Grab your favorite snack - Find yourself a really stupid friend - Go to the cinema - Take your bad sense of humor with you.Definitely not the best movie ever, but a regular good movie witch is an good example of comedy these days....",American Reunion
175,masamies99,Parallel universe,6,28 June 2012,"This film takes place in a parallel universe, where almost nobody is obese or even semi-obese, women are absolutely gorgeous regardless of their age, and they are more willing to have sex than men.This makes me sad and sorry... for the real world!!! Obviously this film is about reunion of the class '99. Pretty much all of the original characters appear in this film, although some of them only for a few seconds and quite artificially. Expected silliness occurs, and it felt like I had seen a dozen of films just like this before. So nothing really new or original, but still quite funny. But I'm feeling like I'm starting to be a bit too old for this (being about the same age as the main actors in this film).By the way, Jim's circumcised penis is shown in a closeup in the unrated version.",American Reunion

177,james_gant,It's a journey not a laugh marathon,9,8 May 2012,"Let's start by saying this, Reunion is a film that to get the most out of you ideally must see the original first 3 films. A lot of the negative reviews you see treat it like a standalone film out of its time and trying to recapture it's faded glory, I see it more like Clerks II and I am catching up with old friends.Back in 1999 when the first film came out I went to the cinema with some friends to see it and most of us being fresh faced 21 year olds we all laughed our nuts off but it came at a time when we all started getting into relationships and drifting apart. Fast forward 13 years and I am sitting with my wife watching American Pie: Reunion while my son sleeps at his Aunties and immediately both of us (as we discuss later) get hit by a wave of nostalgia. The film rolls on by and as it does you catch glimpses of old locations, music, characters and visual gags that start triggering memories and feelings dropped into the back of my brain and not unpacked for years. It's the way Jim talks to his dad, the facial expressions stifler forms they all make you smile even when they aren't jokes because they take you back in time.I am not going to say this films genius because it isn't and it is an old formula but that's why I love it. The film skits between scenes, Jim's car situation borders solely on an excuse to show boobies, some actors like Suvari, Reid and Klein haven't exactly perfected their craft but they recreate their characters fairly well and tell a story about growing up, drifting apart and the pitfalls of trying to turn back time. I found it was after the film ended when my wife and I sat there talking about old times, how we met and people we hadn't heard from in a while that started a cascade of nostalgia. I fired up you tube and started playing all the old music from the films and the era in general, we then vowed to dust off the DVD's and find Road trip to watch the next weekend and it is for this I thank the cast and crew of Reunion not so much for the film alone but for the reaction it has evoked.I hope it brings as much nostalgia and joy to other people.",American Reunion
178,bryanh2585,Best slice of pie for last,10,20 March 2012,"I saw an advance screening of American Reunion in Chicago tonight. Sean WIlliam Scott and Jason Biggs both attended and spoke with the audience before the movie and were very grateful and genuine about the movie. And were very funny too. This was the perfect way to end the series. And I hope they do end it here, because it was perfect. NOT that I wouldn't see American Old Folks Home, but let's not let it get to that. All the characters were just as great as they were in the first 2 films. Oz, Kevin, Finch, Jim, and of course the man who comes with most of the laughs Stifler are all back. As well as pretty much every single speaking roll from the original movie. I will say this is as good if not better than the original. The story is great and very realistic to what most of us are going through today. We hate our jobs, we're married or in some kind of middle aged rut. We still just want to be the kids we were in high school but it's hard because as much as we don't like to admit it we have all grown up. Never fear though with all the boring life stuff, the gang is all back and come with many many fun moments and get themselves into quite a few pickles. I'd say as many as the first 2 movies combined. But it doesn't feel forced or like they threw it in the movie just because they felt they had to. Everything flowed naturally and kept me and the entire audience laughing from beginning till the credits rolled. All of the characters end up in a great place at the end, and I can thoroughly say that this will be a classic. No doubt about it. Ton of laughs, it had heart, makes you feel like you can relate to these guys more than ever. I've grown up with these guys and we all have friends like this. I was sad it ended so soon, even though it was over 2 hours. It was still sad to see the guys go one last time. Overall American Reunion was on par if not better than the original. The original will always be a classic in our eyes, but this will be a close second.To the next step10/10",American Reunion
179,steviec1972,The boys are back in town,10,28 April 2012,"Anyone who loved the first 3 movies will simply adore this reunion. It's like meeting up with old friends after many years and wishing you'd done it sooner. The opening scene where it's implied that some bedroom action is taking place and the camera pans back to show Michelle bouncing the baby on her knee and downtrodden Jim looking tired and miserable sets the pace of the movie immediately. Thankfully Stiffler hasn't changed a bit and i think we can all learn a bit from this character's zest for life and refusal to mature or change to fit societies conventionalism. Lot's of gags, a catch up with all the old guys and gals, some tender and touching moments and once again Eugene Levy as Jim's dad stealing the show. Everything fans of the original 3 movies would want and more, lets hope they can do it all again in another 10 years. 10 out of 10 *****",American Reunion
180,Empty-tummy,For the Fans by the Fans,8,7 April 2012,"Having grown up on the American Pie trilogy (yes, I am not counting the Direct-to-{enter playable media for mass consumption here}), I have to say I am extremely satisfied watching this movie.Watching it reminded me of the reasons I fell in love with the characters in the first place. Empathy. I understood Jim's need to have Nadia and then falling in love with Michelle. I got Oz wanting something better for himself and yet trying to hold on to his own character. I felt Kevin's desire for Vicky and his love for his wife. I got Finch's attraction to an older woman and finally finding someone for himself. I idolized Stifler (Steven) - enough said!This movie has nostalgia all over it. There is no mistaking it. It didn't set out to make new fans as much as respect the ones who grew up with the original theatrical movies. And finally it brought up the issues which a lot of us are facing right now as we are done with school, and, trying to make it in the ""real"" world.With little knowledge, even lesser aspirations, when bills become important (Oh! The freaking credit score!), dreams seem delusional, and, getting stuck in dead- end jobs with obligations getting in the way of ""livin' the vida loca"", it's an appropriate story which speaks to a generation feeling the same discomfort and lack of hope which we are as now.And yet, it does it in a light hearted manner without making fun of it. The movies get us. And we, in return, get it. It's not about the pursuit of a dream as much as it is about the celebration of life, where we all have our friends, our family, and, our own selves to count on to get us through it all.As a result, this movie ties it up in a neat little package - that at the end of it all, it's not as bad (maybe bleak =P) as it looks. We still have each other. We have made new friends, new family, and, have found a new us. However, it's not at the expense of the old, but, in fact an evolution of it.Therefore, that is where the movie works. It's about the heart. Therefore, it is for the fans, by the fans - and if new ones comes along, then all the better for it. =)P.S.: I hope a new movie is not made as this serves as a wonderful swan song, but, if it is, it better be as good and as original, and, especially as innovative and exploratory of the evolution in our lives as we grow older. =D",American Reunion
181,jeppy3456,I don't get why,4,7 April 2012,"I am really having a hard time with the ratings that have been handed out recently for comedies. What makes a comedy good? Well, in my opinion, the best comedies of the decade have been films like Old School, Wedding Crashers, Anchorman, 40 year old virgin, etc. Those movies are filled with clever lines and new ideas; and American Reunion lacks both. I liked the first one a lot, and the next two were pretty good, but this one was a downright terrible script. Peoples sense of humor must have changed recently, because everyone only laughs at physical humor, which isn't that funny to me and is cheap laughs. For instance, in 21 jump street, when someone trips out and bangs into things people are going crazy but when there is a classic funny line people just smiled. I don't know what has happened in the last few years but I don't see how this movie could possibly get a 7.3. This isn't a classic comedy by any stretch, and only classic comedies receive ratings that high.",American Reunion
182,jsummers88,A Welcome Return,7,21 March 2012,"My school was handing out tickets for a special screening for American Reunion tonight, I just got back from the screening. I was never a die hard fan of the American Pie series, but I've always found them to be quite enjoyable. I still feel the same way when I was watching this film. I'll be honest, I thought this one wasn't going to be any good and I thought it would be toned down, I'm glad to be wrong this time around. I'm not going to go much into the plot except that it's simply a reunion as all the characters are here to return, which it what you'd expect coming into this. It's just as sweet and crude as the previous three. Just like the other films, Seann William Scott is still the best part of the film. The rest of the cast did just as good as they did with the previous films. If you're a fan of the previous films, you'll still find something to enjoy.

It slightly pulled on your heart-strings and a desire that all relationship problems would end this way.Stifler was the executive producer....enough said. he is the funniest character and should either remain doing what he does best or spend more time learning the dos and don't's of a producer.",American Reunion
184,kwon234ioud1,The best American Pie Movie,10,29 March 2012,"American Pie was great. The sequels weren't so good. They were juvenile and fell flat because the humor was too obvious and dumb. But American Reunion was awesome! It had great believable storyline, character development, and well-placed physical humor like the original American Pie. It brought back the nostalgia of the high school years of the '90s while commenting on current times.I brought a friend who has never seen the American Pie series, and she laughed throughout the entire movie. Seann William Scott aka ""Stifmeister"" carries American Reunion just as he did in the original American Pie.Sometimes you can tell a movie is going to bomb when you see the trailers. If the trailers are really funny, chances are the comedy is going to be a dud because all the funny moments are shown in the trailers.Trust me. The trailer does not do this movie a justice for a reason. You can not fit all funny moments in the trailer.***Movie contains graphic images*** Word of advice: wait until the credits end for a nice surprise",American Reunion

It has typical features that we're used to seeing in all the American Pie films and it is a must see for anyone who has enjoyed the previous films. The acting is actually very good and you can still find those awkward moments between Jim and his Dad in this film! As per usual, it had enough to make me laugh and enough to keep me interested - if you know what I mean. It's a fast paced film that will keep you entertained throughout. Definitely a must see. I would especially recommend it if you're trying to decide a film to watch with your friends - because this is the one.",American Reunion
186,Jedi_Critic_Master,One thing is for sure: American Reunion is more hip than American Pie 2 and American Wedding,7,29 May 2012,"I saw American Reunion the day it came out and as it turns out, it is better than I thought it would be. The schemes of Jim, Oz, Kevin, Steve, and Finch get themselves into trouble, but it becomes clever when they get out of it. Steve Stifler is at his best, most clever, and funniest actions, the dialogue is well-added to reunification of the characters and occasionally funny, and the revival of the minor characters is surprisingly wonderful; Especially the Shermanator, Nadia, and John Cho who plays Harold in Harold & Kumar. And you know what, even with recyclements from the first, it is better than American Pie 2 and The Wedding in almost every way. Compared to those two, I think it is worth seeing for American Pie fans even though it is not on the same measurements as the first slice of Pie. Besides, along the way, it's hilarious, it's moments of reunification are engaging, and there's a lot of wild Adult-Teen fun. It also succeeds at regaining the pleasantness of the first two and is less gross than American Wedding. However, I'll be honest: It's immature seeing Jim, Kevin, Finch, Oz, and Stifler doing immature things in their 30s but it reminds why we liked them for doing immature things in the first, they're still there for each other, and it's nice to see every character reunited. In fact, it's so worth seeing you get to see your favorite characters do funny things you never get to see them do in the first three that is surprisingly entertaining, especially Jason Stifler's Mom meeting Jim's Dad but I won't give out a lot of spoilers. American Reunion is a reunion worth going to... SEE... FOR LAUGHS. And one thing is for sure: American Reunion is more hip than American Pie 2 and American Wedding.",American Reunion

I know a lot of people may disagree with me but i thought this film could of been a hell of a lot better, they have a great cast of people and i'm sure the actors are talented enough but some of the interactions just seemed boring and forced, it felt like they were just doing this for the money and didn't really care about the characters or i could just be talking complete balls here, judge for yourselves but i certainly wouldn't choose to pay to see this movie again.",American Reunion
188,nindif,A well rounded conclusion consistent in sentimentality and humour,9,5 April 2012,"'Reunion' is a perfectly fitting ending to a series which has matured and developed into something far greater than your typical teen sex comedy. Now lets hope they can leave it as it is and not revisit the series with a fifth sequel.The fourth (series proper) installment of the American Pie series explores the evolution of our five main protagonists from the original three films and their journeys into the next stage of their lives. Within the near two-hour runtime, we see the characters we have come to know and love try to rekindle their high-school spirit and return to East Great Falls as the infamous class of '99 to party hard one more time, only to find themselves at a crossroads in their collective and individual lives.The first act of the film does an effective job of reintroducing us to each of the characters and informs the audience what they have been doing since the wedding of Jim and Michelle. Unfortunately many of the jokes and scenes from the these opening minutes form a large portion of the films trailer, which leaves many of the jokes falling flat.The character of Stifler has been appropriately reigned in by a solid performance from William Scott, whose depiction was manic in the wedding, we now see perhaps the biggest maturing arc in the film. This Stifler is the most at odds with his high school self, finding himself in a lowly assistant position at his work underneath a geeky and demanding boss, he longs for the days of crazy party's, drunk girls and insane adventures. Throughout the film, we see our group come to grips with the fact they are no longer the party generation they once were, and now have responsibilites which may not be as glamorous or exciting as they wished they were. However, the film moves them to appreciate the value in their lives, with each finding contentment - with a particluarly funny ending for Stiflers character.The film does well at paying equal attention to each of its protagonists, and each storyline receives adequate time to develop. Particularly well-done are the cameo appearances by some original characters including Sherman, Nadia and Jessica. Their places in the film are really well done for the small parts they each play, which provides a well-rounded ending to nearly all the characters from the films. The only missing player which perhaps deserved mention was Cadence from American Wedding, who seemed to develop a relationship with Stifler at the end of the 3rd film. We are left to wonder what may have happened between the two, however, a simple mention would have been a nice additio; much in the same way Oz makes mention to Jim about missing his wedding.Perhaps the strongest element to the film is the overarching analogy of Stifler and his boss to the characters and their lives. Stiflers boss is a small, geeky, demanding and power-obsessed character. A person who Stifler now finds himself working underneath. As the film comes its final stages, we see the final showdown between Stifler and his boss, where Stifler confronts him about his position, his stature and the sheer fact that his life is made of fake relationships and pretend power. At his most prophetic, Stifler shows that it is true friendship that truly matters in life, not status or power or reputation. After an entertaining house party for all the wrong reasons (hint; Jim's Dad at Stiflers party) it is very nice to see Jim, Oz, Kevin and Finch finally accept Stifler into their group as one. While the film is consitent in its humour, which never feels forced or rushed or out of place or taste, much of the film speaks to the generation for who it has evoloved with. The film is very sentimental and focuses much more on the characters finding happiness in their lives as they are, not as they were. People new to the series, or those who did not grow up with the Pie franchise may find the film slow or perhaps even tame by todays comedy standards. But for those who the film is intended, there is much to like and appreciate with this fitting ending. Heres to next time!",American Reunion

And you know what? It was amazing!Simply because they made it as good as the original and the second movie. (I liked the first two but I personally think that the third one drifted away from the original theme a bit) I also liked how they made Stifler return to his original state. Crazy as always, doing things the way he wants to do. The other thing that I found good was that they briefly showed what everyone does after high school and at what position they are at the moment.All in all, great film (what else could you expect from these guys), I'd say go see it, definitely worth your time!",American Reunion
191,prakian,The lowest form of cinematic expression.,1,18 May 2012,"Yeah. The title pretty much sums it.Cheesy dialogs, the same old awkward situations that eventually lead to dramatic stupid dialogs, and then things are suddenly better.I'm not saying the first ones were good for something, but this one gives a new meaning to the term generic movie. This is so bad that the actors seem to do it with a sour taste in their mouth.If you expect the same old basic aborted Hollywood script, that says nothing, then this movie is for you. Otherwise avoid it. It's not even funny when it should be funny. I come to think that the recent study that correlates being fat with being stupid (in US) has a direct and harmful consequence over many things people produce. The market will continue to make these kind of movies, because stupid folks are ready to pay money. Just because the ratings are good, doesn't mean this movie deserves more than one star!Avoid it. And yeah, this is not a subjective opinion, because American Reunion is garbage, fact!",American Reunion
192,BogdanZadorozhny,The Greatest Piece for Last,8,26 April 2012,"This film was a surprising, even miraculous end to a long journey. The American pie franchise was getting extremely stale, re-using old jokes, and creating B-movie sequel flops until the monstrosity that is the Book of Love was created. As such, there were no high expectations going into the film, nothing special was really expected, and a decent enough sequel was the peak of my hopes.However this film goes far, far above that. Remember how the first film was actually fresh, funny and with a legitimate message? Yeah, strangely enough this film is that too. The characters here are almost as we remember them, but something's off, something's new about the whole new escapade. It's that they're adults. And with the characters, the whole teen sex comedy series grows up with them. This film is still uproariously funny, bringing back many of the characters and tropes that fans know and love but somehow it goes beyond that. American Reunion is more than just a cash-in attempt that brings all the characters together; it's the end of a saga, it marks our own aging along with the characters.This movie was truly moving and touching. It moved beyond the nostalgia factor, it moved beyond the massive shadow of the series. I never thought I would say this about an American Pie movie, and especially the eighth sequel but this film was beautiful. It does more than simply make us laugh harder than any other film you've ever seen, does more than simply relive the glories of films past, it truly creates something original, towering above all other films in the series.Like the Stifmeister, we as the audience learn an important life lesson. It's that we can't keep reliving our high school days, our past, the best days of our lives. We must move on, and finally become adults.The best days of our lives our over; American Pie is over. And yet we have saved the best piece for last.",American Reunion
193,jaywalker920,The boys are back,10,7 April 2012,"Being an American Pie fan since the beginning, I was excited about American Reunion. The boys are back for another crazy, sexual, and over- the-top adventure.Since the last film in 2003, I thought they wouldn't be able to perform as well together. But from start to finish, they played their roles as if they never left. This movie will definitely keep you laughing, especially if you are a long time fan. Not to mention Jim's dad finally got the screen time he deserved. Now, I don't think it was as good as it could have been. The plot, as mentioned in other reviews, was plain. But all in all, It was an amazing sequel to the series. Better than the first? I don't think so. But as good as the first? YES!I do recommend watching the last three American Pie movies before going to see this. You will understand the movie much clearer, and not to mention the little surprise(s) will have you rolling on the floor laughing.Cons: It wasn't dirty enough. The jokes were hysterical, but I wanted more! I wanted more F bombs, sex jokes, and pie humping! But I guess that is what the previous Pie films were for ;)If you are a fan, you will enjoy this film. You will NOT be disappointed.10/10 stars",American Reunion
194,Zacharys_Movies,A Perfect Nostalgic reunion with old friends,10,25 April 2012,"After many long years of waiting has finally come, and with American Pie 4: The class reunion is now the third sequel to the cult comedy cinema.Caveat: The wait has been worth it! Just as everyone is at ease in front of his class reunion. The stars of the past, have lost nothing.We have seen the movie on 04/24/2012 at Herne in the sold-out preview.With this 4th Part of it is the creators Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg, Chris Weitz, Paul Weitz and for the first time as Executive Producers Jason Biggs and Seann William Scott worked perfectly all the characters, and that really all the characters back into their roles back to the screen to bring .When the film began and now sparkled even the first song with the Universal globe on the screen, it was clear we are back in the American Pie universe.American Pie 4 is completely on the nostalgia factor, and this is precisely the strength of the film. We are also explained in exactly the characters so we feel as if you never left. Stifler is, as always, has not achieved much, and still lives with his mum, Finch is the coolest type on earth, Oz is a sports presenter and famous celebrity dance-off (Here is also a cool cameo by Neil Patrick Harris), Jim and Michelle are married or have a young son but your relationship seems to problem, Vicky is single and looking forward to the reunion, Heather has a devious doctor as a friend, and Kevin is now home and looks far too much television.The good thing about this film is that he remains true to himself and relies on nostalgia, and not tailored to the hangover generation. Just dig at the Hangover, Justin Bieber and Twilight has me very much. I'm Twilight opponents and makes Stifler down Twilight, what more could you want ;) Right here comes the boys a high school reunion just right, but you quickly find that it is just not as used to. And here is another very Decisive thickness of the film, as falls or is hereby this film. When the guys come together, it really is with immediate effect as the past. You have lost nothing, wit, charm swipes everything is back to it without ever come to below the belt. Stifler's perpetual loggerheads with Finch (problem: Stifler's mom). This time also allowed Jim and Stifler's mom with dad at the party and just the two concerns for a lot of jokes. Overall, the whole film a gag fireworks. It is an absolute fan film. All the memories are just fun part 1-3. The stories about each character was lovingly and worked out in minute detail. Even the little cameos from Milf Guy 1 and 2, Nadia, Sherman and Jessica are just great.Spoiler! Personally, I love the fact that Finch evolved and no longer thinks only of Stifler's mom. Stifler Gets His Revenge (A certain mother shows up) Jim and Michelle, as always, is the final. Heather and Oz have for me personally, but the most beautiful part of the whole movie. At the end of the film for any fan or a reference to part 5 is provided. End spoiler! For me, the soundtrack is a very important point. Part 4 has a very good soundtrack, but he can not reach the other soundtracks of 1-3.The acting was just as benefits are very good in Parts 1-3 and even Tara Reid (Vicky Lathum) can sometimes points here ;). At the end remains to say who'd like to have long loud laugh in this film is just right. If you could start with the parts 1-3 can probably nothing will not do anything with this part. Although everyone has to try it yourself ;).Who was the trailer is already well surprised as the movie itself is still a lot better. The film holds more than it promises, and I was not disappointed as the Years of a fan but I think with such a high level to please even a 5th Part will follow. I could continue writing long hours but then I would make the film a synopsis ;) American Pie 1 9/10 American Pie 2 10/10 American Pie 3 9/10 American Pie 4 9/10 Be sure to sit up after the credits remain important ;) American Pie 4 gets me 9/10 but only in comparison to Part 1-3 smooth or he would get 10/10.

Brings back nice memories!!!,10,1 July 2012,"I cant say which of the four is the best (American pie,American Pie 2,The wedding and Reunion)I believe all of them are equal and each has something different to offer. On this one the gang reunites to prove that it still has what it takes to make us laugh and enjoy one hell of a film. The are older but still with the same level of craziness, its like they haven't got older not a singe day. This film reminds us more of the first one rather than the other two and brings a feeling of nostalgia. It has some nudity but nothing to shocking or offensive.I gave it a solid 10 because at the end of the film i was paining my cheekbones from all the laugh, and in addition brought back some very beautiful memories of the old time not just the gang but personal and like i said is not better than the others just different and i did put a solid 10 in all four of them. I hope there is a sequel on the way because at the end it kinda leaves you with the feeling that there will be one but also leaves you craving for one.

197,loliveronline,One of the best movies out of the better movies - you either love or hate it,9,3 June 2012,"Im 28 years old and watched the first one ofc at a younger age. I live in Sweden and one of my big ""issues"" today is the picture of my past, present and future.Did I do enough? should I do more? Its a depression that comes and goes from day to day.I didn't expect much of this movie tbh, late at night, I downloaded it as many others do today and started watching it.The other movies are all decent movies, fun to watch and brings a lot to the viewers while still being a unique youth film.This one tho has it all, and I'm ready to say its the best one in the series and one of the best movies so far beyond 2010.It touches on very sensitive subjects and this movie actually is a lot deeper than many might think it is. If I would start typing down the important parts of the movies I would have to spend my entire night here.There isn't rly much more to say about the movie tbh, you have to watch it for yourself, all-tho I think this movie is the kind of movie you either hate or love if you was growing up with American pie.A lot of people hate this movie and are shocked by the rating it has here on IMDbI think it should have a 8.5 at least.Hey I know it sounds stupid, I never ever believed that I would post something on IMDb about a American pie movie, but seriously, if your in same situation as me I think you will love this movie.It makes you both sad and happy at the same time.This is one of the best movies out of the ""better"" movies that has ever been made.certainly worth a spot in the top 250.",American Reunion
198,ironman2008,American Reunion Screening Review,10,23 March 2012,"I was lucky enough to catch an advance screening last night at the Mall of America in Minnesota. This movie will not disappoint anyone who is a fan of the original movies or the characters. It has all of the gross-out humor, sexual tension, and most importantly the heart. It doesn't break in any new ground, but gives great closure to all of the characters. The laughs also are spread out well from start until during the credits. In face, I think the first 3 minutes was the funniest I've ever seen in a movie. Even my wife who is just a casual fan laughed more at this movie than any other comedy I've taken her to. Stifler is back!!",American Reunion
199,killereagle09,Wasn't expecting this at all!,10,6 April 2012,"Wow like Wow. I really wasn't expecting to watch this movie at all until maybe it came out to DVD or something. Although my friend had an extra ticket to see the midnight showing.So of course i was down to go! Anyway with out further or do, i have to say this movie is packed with laughter for a whole 2 hours. I think they did an amazing job with this one imo. Nothing was forced, but the timing of everything was really good. A lot of perfect moments. I have to say now that this is probably one of my new favorite movies. And that's because i don't really like watching movies, more of a documentary guy ;) So for the people reading this, if you liked the previous American Pie movies, you're going to love this one! If you haven't watched a funny movie in a while taken upon on watching this one this weekend.",American Reunion
200,nicholas_j_rocks,I was very surprised with this film.. in a good way.,8,29 June 2012,"I just recently watched this film yesterday. I did have some scepticism before watching, thinking that it may have been an over-hyped sequel that may fall flat within the American Pie series. It seem as though, when it comes to these kinds of comedies, sequels are difficult to make as to succumb to success of the movies preceding it. However, I was pleasantly surprised with how entertaining this movie was. I had a great mix of comedy and heart in the film and it all worked very well. I found myself laughing out loud more frequently than I thought I would. The movie stars all the original characters that you come to know and love from the American Pie franchise (despite the less than perfect spin- offs). Even some of the iconic secondary characters make an appearance in the film, but I'll let you watch that for yourself. I thought the story was great. Having the class of 99' reunite with the announcement of their high school reunion. It was very interesting to see your favourite characters on the big screen again and seeing what they have been up to and the problems they are facing. The comedy is hilarious. I must say, lots of the hilarity comes from Jim's Dad played by Eugene Levi. However, I found that every actor brought all their energy and heart in to reprising their character. Jim (Jason Biggs) gets into more crazier situations then ever, Stiffler (Seann William Scott) is still stuck in the past and wants to keep the party rolling and getting all of his friends in trouble etc. You can expect all your favourite characters to be just as great as they were in the previous films. However, some more than others. Nostalgia surrounds the film entirely as you can't help but remember all the fun times of the 90's. The film does great job in making the comparison of how times have changed since then. Our characters are left confused with how much times have changed yet at the same time, all of them are still exactly the same as they always were. The film makes it clear that they all have not seen each other in quite sometime and are facing problems in their life whether they mention them or not. The cameos made by the some of the iconic secondary characters from the previous films are quite entertaining however are very short and seem a little forced and a bit unnecessary at times. All in all, it was great to see them though. I really enjoyed this film for how it stayed in touch with all the stuff we love about American Pie and I really enjoyed it. It was very funny and entertaining. I'd say one of the best things in the movie is the surprise you get near the end. I won't spoil anything, but it is some very entertaining ""pay back"" made by a certain character. This was a great film and lives up to American Pie franchise.",American Reunion
201,PhillipRiback,The glorious reunion - A great come back of American Pie,7,7 November 2012,"Glorious reunion of generation '99 graduates will find our heroes unprepared. Jim and Michelle are trying to raise two year old child. Oz is a successful sports commentator and unsuccessful participant ""Dancing with the Stars"" in relationship with a model and still in love with his first love Heather, Kevin is happily married to an architect, who with his old love Vicky stopped to talk ""a hundred years ago"", Finch is simply vanished from the face of the Earth, and Stifler works as an errand boy in a prestigious law firm. Returning to his home town and among the people with who they have (sexualy) growing up will bring nostalgia and occasional forgotten feelings so the weekend that follows will serve as an ideal opportunity to turn their lives with which they are not satisfied, once again back on the right track. However, there are some new Stifler and Jim's that could complicate things, Vulgar skits, usually in Stifler's performances, really amuse in its childlike stupidity and shocking. When Stifler avenges to arrogant freshmen in his own specific, self consistent way, it was really hard for me to hold back laughter. Such vulgarity and obscenities are there in a hundred other teen nonsense comedies, but here, behind every teat is hiding a solid back story that developed some very entertaining moments. Even more than the usual American Pie this one won me with humor based on age of the main characters, of their apparent not belonging to the setting of high school parties (and just a little sad) desire to return to the days when they did not have to think about shaky marriages, demanding children, work commitments, annoying bosses or Facebook statuses.Silly confusion characteristic of Jason Biggs has found the right partner in comedic talent of Seann William Scott, who, is in the same time the heart, the comedy, and symbolism of the entire film. Kid in a thirty-years old body, dissatisfied with ""adult"" life and responsibilities that it brings is not only the source of the huge amount of laughter (while often sufficient are his facial expressions or looks), in some way he represents all of us in the audience, who after ten years we for sure have forgotten the date written on our personal or driving license and let teenagers in us to be a carefree adult man.",American Reunion
202,bappybrmn,good,8,12 October 2013,"There can't be any American pie without Stifler. Stifler rocks.. Nice work Since they continue the American Pie Series (i.e., continuation of American Pie 1, 2 and 3). It brings the original Pie gang back at a time where the actors are well past their own younger years, and the world has grown up. Anyway its a good movie, watchable for several times. As always the end is awesome. My favorite character is Stifler. Wish Stifler's brother was there in the movie. Hope so they continue the series. For me the best scene was when Stifler shits on the beer. I don't want to say what happens inside this movie because it might spoil your mood.",American Reunion
203,umut3429,Great Film,10,14 November 2013,"The movie is very successful.I watch the film every month.Every scenes is very successful.There a couple new characters but none of them are annoying or take up too much of the story, all those parts are well cast. Jim's Dad and Stifler's Mom are hilarious on screen together. Jim's Dad is the funniest he has ever been- but again- not in an over the top way. All in all, it's a well- written, well-rounded film with some good plot twists. Tons of references too the old films. Literally, all of the obscure characters from the first two make an appearance at some point.10/10 Point :)",American Reunion
204,simonthm,Surprisingly Awesome Movie,9,9 March 2012,"Caught a preview screening of this movie tonight in NYC. I am 26 years old now, so I was in 8th grade when the original came out.Thought the first two were awesome but thought the third noticeably drifted away from what made the first two special.(A little too much Stifler).For American Pie 4, when I saw the preview I was excited to see them all back together, but I didn't know what to expect. I know Hollywood loves destroying sequels and I didn't know how they were going to create a story line out of characters that really haven't been together in forever.Fear not. I though this movie was almost as good as the original. Two hours of non-stop cracking-up, but none of it was forced. They brought back all the characters, but in a way that didn't seem thrown together or in-genuine. It was about 2 hours and 15 minutes long, but not once did I think this was dragging. They did a nice job explaining where everyone has been and it didn't really seem awkward.The best part of it is, the story is about all 5 of the original guys, and their relationship with women and sex at their current juncture (31 years old). Each have their own issues (too married, have kids, hate their jobs, hate their lifestyle, etc.) and the movie is kind of about them all resolving their that over the course of a reunion weekend. It's the American Pie which is most similar too the first one. All the old couples from high-school (Oz/Heather, Kevin/Vicky, Jim/Michelle) re-hash their past feelings.Another great thing about the film is that Stifler's character is written back in the style of American Pie 1 and 2, which I loved. His part is not over bearing like the Wedding. Kevin, Finch (and Oz) play much bigger roles than they did they did in the third.There a couple new characters but none of them are annoying or take up too much of the story, all those parts are well cast. Jim's Dad and Stifler's Mom are hilarious on screen together. Jim's Dad is the funniest he has ever been- but again- not in an over the top way. All in all, it's a well-written, well-rounded film with some good plot twists. Tons of references too the old films. Literally, all of the obscure characters from the first two make an appearance at some point.BOTTOM LINE: 9/10. If you are a fan of the American Pie films (especially 1 & 2) your going to LOVE this movie. Worth the $.",American Reunion
205,nitzjim-89999,Hommage to the fans and a very funny movie,9,16 September 2020,"It is clear that the saga American pie defined the generation born around 1985-1980. This movie isnt just a simple comedy with the american pie theme it is more like a hommage. It is certain that not everyone will like it but I feel like the movie was just made to make a big bang for the conclusion of the saga.The movie is in its majority fun and laughing. I felt enjoying the same humour as the first one. It's gross but damn fun.Thanks American Pie,you and Blink 182 were my inspiration for my teenaghood. Now in 2020,34 y o I see as this movie the end of an era.",American Reunion
