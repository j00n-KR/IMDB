0,Leofwine_draca,Film adaptation of a little-known Stephen King novella,6,25 October 2017,"1922 is the most recent of the many film adaptations of the writings of Stephen King. This one's based on a novella that I hadn't encountered before and is very simple material, slightly stretched out to fill the feature length running time. The story sees a disturbed Thomas Jane playing a farmer in the early 20th century who becomes irritated by his wife's behaviour and constant antagonism, an irritation which finally develops into a full-blown murderous rage.This low budget story goes for the psychological approach with plenty of depth and psychological intrigue. The cast is small and the performances carefully judged. Jane is unrecognisable as the lead character and probably gives the best performance of his career so far. The events depicted are unsurprisingly gruesome, albeit familiar; I didn't find them frightening in the slightest, although they are ghoulish and interesting.",1922
1,Prismark10,Getting ratty,6,21 October 2017,"Adapted from a Stephen King short story, 1922 is a slow burn psychological thriller of a conniving man who once made a wrong decision.Thomas Jane plays Wilfred James, a poor farmer in Nebraska. His wife named Arlette (Molly Parker) dislikes the farming life and just wants to sell her share of the farm and leave to the city with her son. Her husband can rot for all she cares.Their son Henry is sweet with the young girl in the neighbouring farm which makes it easy for Wilfred to manipulate his son to do a dastardly deed in killing Arlette.This despicable act unhinges Wilfred, plunges the family and even his neighbour into a spiral of darkness. Wilfred sees visions of his wife and his house is plagued with rats. His son runs off with his pregnant girlfriend and on to a life of crime.A fog of doom overhangs them all, Wilfred is slowly being driven insane. The film is well acted by Jane, there are some disturbing scenes with rats. It is essentially a gloomy ghost story.",1922

3,kosmasp,Guilt of our father,5,2 April 2018,"Sometimes taking on responsibility or rather acting upon what you think is right, might be the wrong thing. Especially if it is considered a sin (and a bad thing for that matter). If you've read the synopsis, you know what I'm talking about. If not I won't spoil one early on relatively shocking moment. Thomas Jane put a lot of effort in this, that is for sure.His accent may feel weird at the beginning, but you get used to it and you have to admire his passion for his job. He may or may not like the interaction with fans, but when it comes to his craft he really loves what he does and you can tell. Unfortunately there is not much he can play with here. Although I'm pretty sure the book is a good read (might have to check it out sometime) ...",1922
4,classicsoncall,"""And I believe there's another man inside of every man.""",8,21 October 2017,"Adapted from a Stephen King novella and presented as a Netflix original film, I think the movie stacks up favorably against some of the larger studio offerings like ""The Shining"" and ""Stand by Me"". In fact, when I enter the title into a list of Stephen King based movies I've reviewed, it comes in right behind the 2017 remake of ""It"", which seems to be quite a favorable placement among King adaptations, certainly a lot better than a picture like ""Riding the Bullet"", or ""Children of the Corn"". Speaking of which, one of the main thematic elements of this film corresponds to that latter picture, with acres and acres of lush, green corn fields set as a backdrop to the story of a farmer intent on adding his wife's inheritance to an already sizable farm.All of which made it a little difficult for this viewer to wrap my head around, as this was originally a one family farm of eighty acres and worked only by Wilfred James (Thomas Jane) and his fourteen year old son Henry (Dylan Schmid). When wife Arlette's (Molly Parker) father dies, she's left with a one hundred acre inheritance which 'Wilf' fully intends to add to his own acreage. Prior to large scale mechanization, I have no idea how Wilf was going to make a go of it, but for the sake of the story I guess one has to take it on faith.As it is though, Arlette sees her windfall as an opportunity to sell out to a large local combine and make a life for herself and her family in a city like Omaha or St. Louis. However her idea about opening a dress shop is met with stiff resistance by her husband, and quite coincidentally, her own son, who has a local sweetheart. When Wilf finally realizes that his wife is firm, he sets in motion a ghastly plan to murder her with his son as an accomplice.Though the film enters horror territory with the murder of Arlette, there appears to be a distinct departure from some of King's other works. In this one, it's not so much the return of Arlette's ghost that provides the scary elements, as the psychological trauma Wilfred experiences over the guilt of his crime. Not only does he experience the loss of his wife, but the son and eventual heir who he loves, runs off with his pregnant girlfriend, and turns to a life of crime to try and provide for them in a time and place devoid of employment opportunities. When news of their death reaches Wilf via his deceased wife's voice from the grave, he suffers an emotional breakdown heralded by the return of all three 'ghosts'.With Netflix, I find that they bring a real professionalism to the films made for their platform. Cinematography, effects and performers compare favorably to larger studios with bigger budgets, and for that they are to be commended. This latest entry serves as a good example, and for Stephen King fans, I think the project here is a good one for followers to get a sampling of.",1922
5,paul_haakonsen,"Now, this was somewhat of a nice surprise...",6,9 June 2018,"I didn't know what to expect from this movie, and I hadn't even heard about it prior to finding it on Netflix. I decided to sit down and watch it solely because of the fact that it had Thomas Jane in the lead role.The movie has a very nicely constructed storyline, especially since director Zak Hilditch was so adept at letting the story carry itself and build up momentum.There was some really good acting from an equally nice cast. I will say that Thomas Jane was expertly cast for this role, and he really lived up to the role in every sense. He was very believable and pulled it off quite nicely.The rats were a fantastic image of Wilfred's guilt gnawing at him and gradually breaking down his psyche. There was a very good atmosphere throughout the entire movie.The great costumes and make-up also helped the movie along quite nicely.If I have to put my finger on something here, then I would say that the storyline did suffer from being somewhat predictable though.",1922
6,CinemaSerf,"Too much film, not enough story...",6,28 June 2020,"This isn't so much a movie, as a stark - almost biblical - lesson on the reap and ye shall sow principle. Thomas Jane is unhappily married to Molly Parker. When she decides it is time to sell up their small ranch (complete with fields of tall corn!), he hits on the idea of disposing of her. He ropes in his 14 year old son Dylan Schmid and what follows is a rather beautifully shot story of retribution (divine or man-made) on the pair. This is more of a cross-thread of what happens to the two men dealing with the consequences, than a story with a narrative, and that is where the film really slows down to a rather ponderous grind. It was only ever a short-ish story from Stephen King so it was always going to be tough to properly string it out for 100 minutes and though atmospheric, it is really just a rather procedural plod of a film with little about the two men to engage sympathy. At times the imagery is graphic, but not in an especially potent way, and the dialogue seems to take for ever to make the point we have long guessed for ourselves much earlier. More of a moral message than a movie...",1922
7,grantss,Had potential but ultimately quite unengaging and dull,4,21 April 2019,"Nebraska, 1922. Wilfred and Arlette James and their teenage son Henry move to a farm after Arlette inherits it from her father. After a while Arlette decides to sell it and move to the city, as the farming life is not for her. However, Wilfred is determined to stay, and will kill to ensure that this is the outcome. This reaps a whole lot of unintended consequences.Based on a Stephen King novella, this movie had heaps of potential. The guilt, the unintended consequences, the paranoia - all these had the potential for a tight, engaging, profound drama. Yet it doesn't deliver, just feeling listless and unimaginative. There's no real engagement, as the main character doesn't really do anything to deserve our support and empathy.The Henry-Shannon sub-plot did provide some characters to follow but that received too little screen time.The ending does tie everything together and provides a point to it all, but that point is quite predictable and was already apparent.",1922
8,Wuchakk,There's always another way than murder,7,25 October 2018,"Two members of a corn-farming family in 1922 Nebraska commit a crime and get away with it, but do they really? Thomas Jane and Molly Parker play the parents while Dylan Schmid is on hand as the son, who's about 15.Released in 2017, ""1922"" is a haunting crime drama/period piece with elements of horror, unsurprisingly based on a Stephen King story of the same name. The confined farm location, tone and even genre are akin to films like ""The Messengers"" (2007), ""Husk"" (2011) and ""Signs"" (2002). There's also a nod to ""Bonnie and Clyde"" (1967).Thomas Jane should've gotten an award for his performance, as he literally disappears in the role and is unrecognizable. His farm hick accent is so thick I strongly recommend using the subtitles.The themes revolve around disloyalty, the danger of allowing hostility (hatred) to fester, the abuse of authority/manipulation and the power of conscience.The film runs 1 hour, 42 minutes and was shot, believe it or not, in Western Australia. Additional cast: Kaitlyn Bernard appears as the kid's neighbor girlfriend and Neal McDonough her father.GRADE: B",1922

10,deloudelouvain,Good performance from Thomas Jane,7,8 February 2018,"You could say 1922 is a slow movie but that doesn't mean it's a bad movie. On the contrary that is what makes the movie good. That slow-paced ambiance is perfect in this story, in the harsh environment of Nebraska, where time looks it stood still. I'm not a big fan of that thick awful accent they use for narrating. Well not in real life then, in the movie it's perfect. I'm just glad my wife, that is American, doesn't speak like that. Thomas Jane gave away a very good performance with his character. I don't think you could do better honestly. Certainly one of his better performances. The rest of the cast was also good. The movie is beautifully shot, clearly not done by some amateur. And the story is also worth watching, so I did enjoy this movie and I won't be the only one that do.",1922
11,Hellmant,"I haven't read '1922', but it seems like classic Stephen King to me.",8,3 November 2017,"'1922': Four Stars (Out of Five) A new horror flick based on the novella, of the same name, by Stephen King. It tells the story of a farmer, in 1922, who murders his wife, with the help of their 14-year-old son, in order to keep their farmland. The movie stars Thomas Jane, Dylan Schmid, Molly Parker and Kaitlyn Bernard. It's received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it was released on Netflix through their streaming site. I found it to be effectively creepy and disturbing.Wilfred James (Jane) lives on a farm in Hemingford Home, Nebraska (in 1922), with his wife Arlette (Parker) and their 14-year-old son Henry (Schmid). Wilfred and Arlette are unhappy in their marriage though, and when Arlette inherits 100 acres of land, she threatens to sell it and apply for a divorce. She wants to then move to the city, with Henry. Wilfred won't have it though, and Henry doesn't want to move either, because he thinks he's in love with a local girl (Bernard). So Wilfred convinces Henry to help him murder Arlette. The crime then continues to haunt the two, in extremely disturbing ways.The movie isn't especially scary, or even that suspenseful, it's just really creepy; in pretty disturbing ways too. This is something I think Stephen King books have always been really good at, and their film adaptations (at least the good ones). I haven't read '1922', but it seems like classic Stephen King to me. Thomas Jane gives a great leading man performance in the film, and it's pretty effectively directed too. I'm both glad and sad that I watched it.",1922
12,thesar-2,Rats. Why Did it Have to be Rats?,3,20 January 2018,"In baseball, hitting .334 is pretty good. In movies, that 33% approval isn't winning any new fans.Recently, Stephen King has come back big time. I've seen four new movies of his from 2017 and thanks to some of their successes, I'm sure much more are bound to pop up. But, is it time to take more time to adapt his books?""It,"" the 2017 retelling of his enormous book, was very good. I've read the book and hated the miniseries. Sure Tim Curry did a fine job, but the acting and soap operaish tone was annoying. So, thankfully, they got this new version way up to par. ""It"" was worth taking a stroll down King Blvd. But, 2017 also saw The Dark Tower, Gerald's Game and now, 1922. The Dark Tower was terrible and Gerald's Game was just okay. 1922...Eh.Well shot, definitely. Nicely acted and directed, sure. But, it's slow as hell and boring for the most part. This would've been best served as a 15 minute segment of an anthology series. In fact, just throw Gerald's Game in there, as well. Both would've been best seen for only a quarter of an hour each.(And just delete and reboot The Dark Tower altogether.)I digress. 1922 is the boring tale of a farmer who wants to remain a farmer, his wife who wants more out of the land she inherited and their son who is more on his Dad's side than his Mom's. Out of nowhere, the Dad schemes to murder the female third of the family so he can continue being a farmer and keep his son as his crew. The emotionless son eventually comes onboard with the murder after many scenes of Daddy convincing him to.This Stephen King story must have been written after he sobered up. All his best works were when he was high as kite and before his wife ruined the literary world by cleaning up her husband's act. I LOVE Stephen King books...that is, pre-sober King. The rest is way-too-long garbage that feels like one long rant. This 1922 story has zero substance. Has zero pops and has zero scares.Well, I guess they added in stuff to make it ""scary"" and appear as somewhat horror. But, mark my words, this isn't horror. This isn't scary. And this isn't even in the top 25 King adaptations. Save your time. You won't be any smarter or satisfied when this movie ends.***Final thoughts: If not for the hottie Dylan Schmid, this wouldn't be worth it at all. Oh, and don't get grossed out on me. He's 18. Yeah, still young, but still of age.",1922
13,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Nice atmosphere, but otherwise pretty tepid King adaptation",4,11 September 2018,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningIn 1922, Wilfred James (Thomas Jane) is a farmer, who hatches a plan with his son Henry (Dylan Schmid) to murder his wife Arlette (Molly Parker) for financial gain. However, in the aftermath, aside from trying to cover up the crime, they are haunted by recurring strange events.Oh no, once again I've seen a Stephen King adaptation where I haven't read the original source material. Mind you, now he's making novels titled with numbers rather than letters, I think I may have got this jumbled up with his novella 11.22.63, which was about something completely different altogether. And so, it's a film that's emerged as a surprise offering. It's not a waste of time (at least, not a complete one) but for what it gets right, it gets much more substantially wrong.It's a film that survives on its sense of atmosphere, a moody, lingering one, that succeeds in creating quite an uneasy tone but fails to give the film it's attached to much of a direction to go in. It's a meandering, dull plotline that fails to create much in the way of suspense, despite the potential the story had, with whether the characters would get away with it or not. In the lead role, Jane fits the skin of his character, and manages a quite convincing Southern drawl, but his presence is not enough to carry the film.With it being one of those times I haven't read the novel before I saw the film, I have nothing to compare it to, so I can't say how it failed where the book may have succeeded, but although this isn't the diabolical mess many King adaptations have been, you just have to imagine how much better the book is. **",1922
14,851222,Dark story,7,1 November 2018,"Greeting from Lithuania.""1922"" (2017) is a fine movie with a dark and twisted story. There is no hope at the end, no happy ending. Thomas Jane was excellent in a leading role, others were just OK. This is a dark movie, its story is not an uplifting one, but its not a straightforward horror movie, its more of a psychological thriller with some horror elements which you keep wondering if they are real of just an imagination of our main hero.Overall, ""1922"" is not a straightforward horror movie. Its a movie with a dark story, and it has good settings and great central performance. Not bad movie overall.",1922
15,Platypuschow,1922: An unexpected gem,7,25 March 2018,"Despite Stephen King being one of my favorite authors I have to admit I'd never even heard of 1922 let alone read it.I tend to enjoy Stephen King adaptations, they're not all flawless but many have been outstanding and therefore I do tend to seek them out.1922 is one of two Stephen King Adaptations released by Netflix in the same year beside the disapointing Geralds Game. It stars Thomas Jane & Neal McDonough set in *Drumroll* 1922. It tells the story of a farmer who with the aid of his 14yr old son decides to kill off his wife to maintain the life he is acustomed to and for financial security.The movie is dark, gritty and sombre as you would imagine and Jane may well be at a career best here.If you're expecting horror you will find very little, that simply isn't what 1922 is. If it had to be compared to anything I'd say Edgar Alan Poe's a Telltale Heart would be a good fit.It doesn't make for the easiest viewing and has elements from Of Mice & Men (That she tell you all you need to know) but regardless it is a powerful piece that managed to entertain even despite my initial concerns.The Good:Thomas Jane is excellentGreat narration Looks fantasticThe Bad:Not for animal loversDifficult viewingQuestionable pacingThings I Learnt From This Movie:Not that I thought about it at all but he made some weird choices in covering up the murder *Ahem* not that I in anyway put deep thought into getting away with murder",1922

17,paulclaassen,Very good drama thriller.,6,29 July 2019,"Thomas Jane is a great actor and he seldom disappoints. The rest of the cast were equally good in this very believable drama about a man who fell out of love with his wife. To complicate matters, the farm is in her name, and she wants to sell the farm and move to the city, dreaming of opening her own boutique. Wilfred (Thomas Jane) can't imagine giving up the farm life, though, and decides to get rid of her.The idea of killing your wife is disturbing alone, let alone convincing your son to help! Wow, I never expected the film to become so creepy. This was disturbing on a psychological level, as well.The film effectively illustrates how one decision can set in motion a roller coaster ride of events that would ultimately effect so many people. This was amazing!",1922
18,zkonedog,A Rather Bland & Predictable Adaptation,5,6 November 2017,"Whereas the recent ""Gerald's Game"" was a remarkable adaptation of a Stephen King story, ""1922""...wasn't. It isn't horrible, but it trends far too much towards predictable and plodding to be anything near good.For a basic plot summary, ""1922"" tells the story of a family of farmers. Wilfred James (Thomas Jane) and his son Henry (Dylan Schmid) are died-in-the-wool farmers. The problem? Wife/mother Arlette (Molly Parker) is not...and she's the one who just inherited a bunch of land (which = money in the 1920s). With Arlette threatening to move to the big city to open a dress shop (and take Henry with her), father and son concoct a plan to stop this from happening. But how far will they go to keep their simple farm life...and what consequences will it bring if they go too far?At its literary heart, ""1922"" is a tale of consequences and morality. The problem here, however, is that everything seems so telegraphed that nothing feels unpredictable or exciting. I had read the King story previously, but very long ago and thus I honestly remembered next to nothing. In this adaptation, though, I felt like I knew everything that was going to happen within the first 15- 20 minutes. There are no twists, turns, or surprises...just very straightforward.So, for an adaptation that seems ""right down the middle"", I'll give it an equally ""right down the middle"" grade of five stars out of ten. I could never say ""1922"" is out-and-out bad, but I'm not recommending it to others, either, due to the blandness and predictability.",1922

21,jtindahouse,Harmless but forgettable,6,23 October 2017,"Let me start by saying I have not read the novella of '1922' by Stephen King. I am reviewing this purely as a film. How do I feel about it? I'm middle of the road. I neither loved it nor hated it. I found it a pleasant viewing experience (in terms of quality I am of course talking) yet I doubt that it will hold much memory space for me. It's also not a film I would recommend to people. There are better films out there that need to be seen before this. That's not a slight on the film, it's simply a fact.It certainly feels like a King film. All the usual quirks are there. There have been an abundance of King based works being released lately and they all have that similar feel and atmosphere.Thomas Jane in the lead role was impressive. I've never really thought of him as an actor with a lot of depth, but he certainly proved me wrong in '1922'. The rest of the cast were also up to a high standard.There really isn't a lot to say about '1922'. I suspect it would have worked better as a book, with the insights of the characters minds likely being very interesting.

When Arlette refuses to change her mind, Wilfred and Henry kill her and dump her body at the bottom of a well. However, after killing Arlette the lives of both Wilfred and Henry eventually spiral out of control...I've seen a number of films based on Stephen King novels which are all of varied quality; Shawshank Redemption, Misery & The Green Mile are at the top of the pile with the likes of Pet Semetary, Christine and Cujo being at the lower end of the spectrum. 1922 is a film that slots somewhere in the middle (not fantastic, but not without merit either).One issue I had with the film was its general tone and feel; there are lots of quiet conversations at the start and the thick Southern accents employed by the main cast can be difficult to decipher (particularly for someone like me who is English). Thomas Jane is the worst offender and I really struggled understanding what he was saying quite a lot of the time. Before we get to the actual murder, the film does have a sort of lifeless feel to it; the dark cinematography employed doesn't help either as it can sometimes be difficult to see what is actually happening. The investigation aspect of the film surrounding Arlette's death also felt undercooked and I think factoring this more into the film would have given the film that much needed jolt of excitement.Thankfully the film does improve slightly in the second half when the rift between father and son has been established; without spoiling things you feel as though both parties become victim to the wrath of Karma. The Bonnie and Clyde kind of subplot involving Henry and his girlfriend was an interesting thread, but it felt underdeveloped to me and warranted a little more focus. The father's journey is quite good and the pain and suffering that he endures is quite brutal at times. Both journeys act as a mainframe for the subtext and main point that the film is trying to make which should become clear when you watch the film.As far as performances go then Thomas Jane does give the best performance; (despite the incomprehensibility of his accent at times). The supporting cast all put in good performances and overall from a technical stand point it is a fairly well-made film.Overall then 1922 is an interesting film and I did appreciate the subtext within the narrative. However, on the other hand it's a little lifeless and some areas are not as developed as well as they should have been. In other words, it works in fits and starts, but it's not entirely satisfactory as a whole.",1922

Not only that' it works as a blueprint for a cinematic tour-de-force that should have been. Filled with the appropriate amount of tension and horror you'd expect, but guilty of unfortunate dry spells an even hokey scares towards the end. It's lack of perfection is evident, but so is it's sections of brilliance. Thomas Jane gives an absolutely stirring unsung performance of 2017. Throughly engrossing as Wilfred. It's almost maddening how well he does here in a relatively unknown Netflix film. In terms of story structure, it flows easily and doesn't overstay it's welcome as it clocks in well under two hours. Cinematography is beautiful. The corn fields shine in vivid green and yellow. Add it to the queue and give it a try.",1922

I thought it was neat, I did not read the novella on which it 's based, but if you want to sort of watch it and feel almost all right with the almost happy arc over ending, even though happy in King's world is still not happy , just stop a dab short of the real spooky ending about a few seconds shy thereof, Dang! Why is everything in King's world so dang spooky all the goddamn time!?

Whereas the movie adaption of ""1408"" was heavier in the special effects department, this time around, the acting was more solid. Sorry, but John Cusack just doesn't cut the mustard as an actor anymore and was just non-believable in 1408.Still, the guy who played the lead in ""1922"" was a little hard to understand because he talked without parting his teeth ala Clint Eastwood. Visually, the movie looked good; the pacing, however, was a tad on the slow lane. Unfortunately, in ""1922"" you'll see scenes that were exhibited elsewhere. In other words, not too much originality from Brother King this time around. That's okay. He's rolling in the dough and I'm not, so I can't complain.",1922

35,Alexander_Blanchett,Leads you to dark places,7,2 November 2017,"Solid Stephen King adaptation. A simple story that asks a lot of moral questions. It a dark thriller that invites you to the darkest corners of your soul. The film works because it is very limited in space and character and thus you really get very close into the psyche of the characters. Thomas Jane is absolutely fabulous and was almost not recognizable in the role of the simple but proud farmer. Jane really puts out his acting weapon, loaded it and shot it over the whole film. Great work. Molly Parker was fine but her role was very one note. She did the best she could out of it. I really liked Dylan Schmid who was very convincing. The direction by Zak Hilditch was fine, although he lost it a bit in the second half when I felt they tried too hard to stretch the original short story. Still the film never lost its dark atmosphere and has a lot of shock moments, but not cheap thrills but really disturbing moments. I recommend this to any Stephen King fan or fan of a good old fashioned psychological horror thriller.",1922
36,phenomynouss,There will be blood,9,25 March 2018,"This here film was some sick stuff, and that is intended in a very positive way. The muted style of the film, along with the very subtle, unpleasant soundtrack made it fairly reminiscent to me of the 2007 movie ""There Will Be Blood"", and the subject matter at its core tends to be very much the same; the slow and subtle unraveling of a man.
Thomas Jane is utterly fascinating in his role as Wilfred James (and his accent is even more fascinating) a farmer in 1922 Nebraska who owns 80 acres of land, and is in a failing marriage with a woman Arlette who owns 100 acres of land, and who now wants to divorce, sell her land and move to Omaha with their 14 year old son Henry.
Wilfred provides narration of events using the framing story of him writing his confession later in life of having killed his wife, and provides occasional voiceover narration throughout. Rather than be redundant or providing a ""tell, don't show"" atmosphere, it gives us a very deep, subtle frame of reference for Wilfred James' mindset, one which at once is well aware of his own faults and failings, while also elucidating a personality dichotomy, essentially describing a ""different man"" inside of every man, without ever being explicit as to any attempt to cast blame off of himself onto a sort of ""evil subconscious self"". This ""other self"" isn't even indirectly hinted at as being in any way evil or selfish, but simply ""someone"" who sees things differently.
This ""other Wilfred"" inside of him is purely metaphorical, not at all supernatural or indicative of some mental illness, and it is in some way less of an ""overactive Id"" type persona than a clear functioning ""Superego"", as he makes the calculated decision via this ""other self"" to kill his wife so as to prevent him losing more than half his land and his son.The process by which he comes to this decision is utter brilliance that somehow manages not to be out of character for a 1920s rural farmer; he lures his son Henry into the plot by playing on his worries about his own life and being taken away from his girlfriend Shannon Cotterie. He pointedly says and does nothing when Henry gets into a fight with his mother over the issue, letting him piece together in his own mind that killing her is the only way to maintain his current way of life and stability.When the event comes about, Wilfred knows exactly what to do to cover his tracks, establishing a story that Arlette packed up and left them. He makes sure to dispose only enough of her clothing as can fit in a single suitcase. He makes sure it includes her favorite clothing, as well as some rough clothing like pants and boots meant for travelling. He has her leaving the farm on foot rather than taking the car, so as not to wake Wilfred up.He recognizes that her disappearance would draw attention, and likely an investigation by the Sheriff, and disposing of the body in an abandoned well on his property would arouse suspicion if he was suddenly seen filling it in after her disappearance. So he sacrifices a cow, leading it onto a fragile wooden cover of the well, where the cow's weight breaks it and the cow falls into the well, which he then euthanizes and proceeds to fill in the well, using the dead cow as cover.
From there, everything seems to go perfectly, with Wilfred maintaining a perfect calm and a perfect consistency to his story, while his son Henry constantly quakes and questions himself. The slow downfall of Wilfred James escalates substantially when Henry runs away with Shannon after he impregnates her and her father tries to send her off to a catholic seminary or something of the sort.
From there, Wilfred begins to be haunted by the persistent image of his dead wife, rats collecting around and inside of her body, and by the presence of rats seemingly everywhere in the house. He suffers a rat bite which gets horribly infected and causes him to suffer hallucinations. His dead wife's ghost appears to him, tormenting him by whispering to him the fate of his son and his girlfriend. The previously blossoming corn crops are no longer as copious, and thus he starts suffering serious financial difficulties that, as he's reminded of on at least one or two occasions, wouldn't have happened had he sold his land like Arlette wanted.
By the end, he's alone and destitute, his decision having dragged even his neighbor down with him. As he remarks later on to Wilf, they both started the year with wives and children, and ended the year with neither.
The slow, steady way in which everything unfolds, with Wilf silently enduring all the trauma on top of the ever-present guilty secret of his wife's murder, is utterly fascinating, and the constant pervasive presence of the rats, even squirming out of the walls in the hotel room where he writes his confession 8 years later, is a constant trauma that threatens to break him at every turn. It's a gorgeous film and keeps your attention all throughout.",1922
37,johannes2000-1,Absolutely great!!,10,6 September 2018,"I'm a bit surprised at the relatively low rating here on IMDb (6.3 at the moment I write this), because in my opinion this is really an outstanding and very strong movie. The story is quite simple, but blood-chilling (thanks to the original story by Stephen King of course) and the combination of the wonderful photography, the alienating musical score (Mike Patton) and the bleak dialogues gives it a very effective sinister atmosphere. And then there's the acting of especially father Thomas Jane, it's simply stunning: as a viewer I felt probably as the son did, you know he is totally wrong but you are sucked-in by his matter-of-course self-righteousness and his overbearing power of words and you feel yourself actually caring for him. Dylan Schmid as the son did a great job too, as did Molly Parker as the ill-fated wife/mother. All in all a very, very strong movie and greatly recommended.",1922

In terms of a neutral having not read the book I wouldn't watch at all. There's no real strong storyline to it and I found myself just wanting it to end.Like I said, I have not read this book I watched this as it was a recommended horror film for me on Netflix. It had no scary moments and the plot in itself just had no substance.The performance was great from the main actor, but that's the only real positive I can give from a typical film viewer.",1922
39,latinfineart,This could have been a good movie- it almost was,4,1 December 2017,"I will start by saying I am not a Stephen King fan. On any level. I have tried reading his books on many occasions, and rarely am able to get through one chapter. So, that qualifies my review for many of you. I generally find his writing too trite, too much Americana, and too focused on small details. In this case rats. More rats than you can shake a stick at. I think I would have enjoyed the film a lot more, if it were not for the hundreds of rats, that King makes into central characters in the movies, and in the nightmares.The other issue I had with the film was the moral preaching. Sure, it must be hard to kill someone. But people do it every day, and live happily ever after. The slow descent into hell, is a bit over the top, and very, very American. Of course you cannot get away with a crime like this! God is watching. I am a fan of Thomas Jane. He is an outstanding actor, that does not seem to get enough leading man roles. He deserves more. He was outstanding here. The accent, mannerisms, and movements were spot on. Molly Parker was good, as was the son, and the ever great Neal McDonough. The direction seemed decent, but the film just sort of descended into a hell that was nowhere near entertaining on any level. It could have been. It could have had some of the slow building tension that ""There will be blood"" had. But, it did not. It just got tiresome.",1922

The story was pretty good and, at times, scary, the message was there but the movie was told from the eyes of someone I hate. If it was not narrated and had been told as a horror-thriller-drama kind of movie, it could have been so much better.

46,evening1,The horror of the evil parent,4,11 October 2020,"Nebraska farmer Wilfred wants to hold onto the family's land -- that's the source of a man's self-esteem, he believes. But when his wife gets an inheritance and opts to sell the fields, get a divorce, and run off to Omaha with their 14-year-old son, Wilf draws Henry into a plot to murder her.The deed is accomplished in a most violent, traumatizing way, and Henry (Dylan Schmid) comes away from it hating his dad, who is played by Thomas Jane with a lot of weirdness and a drawl that's often incomprehensible.There are other flaws in this production. After the heinous act, Wilf's guilty torment prompts hallucinations of rats, snakes, and his dead wife. But after we see these two or three times, we get it. These images are forced upon us for the rest of the movie, with no added impact, as if we are dumb. (Just because the story derives from a Stephen King novel does not make this artistic laziness OK!)There is indeed some poignancy in the plight of young Henry. One pities the child of a narcissistic fiend. As a minor, Hank may have lacked the ego strength to go to the cops. Juvie jail, 20s style, likely wouldn't have been as bad as the way things worked out for the ""Sweetheart Robbers."" Their final scene together is indeed moving.",1922

49,tesswysko,"Total Rip-Off of Edgar Allan Poe, Just SLOWER",4,16 April 2019,"I am a huge fan of both Stephen King an Edgar Allan Poe, I know I've read everything by the latter, and I'm pretty sure I've read almost everything except the most contemporary of works by the former. And I know had I read this I surely would have remembered because this is a blatant rip off of The Tell-Tale Heart by Edgar Allan Poe! I cannot believe that I'm giving three stars to not only a Stephen King movie, but at Thomas Jane movie! I love the man! He's an amazing actor from The Punisher to Deep Blue Sea and Beyond! I didn't even recognize him in this movie, even his voice did not sound like him! So basically what I'm saying is this whole thing was one giant disappointment and it felt like taking the carbon paper out of the typewriter and putting it on a piece of paper and rubbing trying to get a copy of what Edgar Allan Poe had written and only getting a ghost and running with it. The actress who played the wife was horrible! From the way the father's character and the sun's character reacted to her, I don't think it was the intention for her to come off this way, but her acting the lines and her emoting, she came off as a very perverted, incestuous, horrible mother who I certainly didn't think even wanted her child around when the two of them started talking about divorce! The things that she would say to her son about his girlfriend we're disgusting enough but the way she was trying to kiss him and almost get up on top of him, it was horrifying! The actor who played the son was supposed to be 15 years old, but he looked a lot closer to 20. I can say that he seemed like maybe he was a pretty decent actor, but he really didn't have enough lines or screen time to really tell. He came off as shy, quiet, and quite honestly a little mentally slow. I was also not impressed At All by the sets they were using, the house was very nice in the inside, but from the outside it was all just clapboard wood completely devoid of decent paint, and that's not the way Farmers lived, they took pride in their house, and they would have been out there painting that in the very least. Much less putting some sort of insulation like I personally know Farmers that use hay and hay bales for insulation. Yes money is tight but paint is not that expensive to paint your house. Even back then.So basically to summarize, on the positive side, Thomas Jane is a good actor. If anything he was the one Saving Grace of the film I would have given it a one-star if it weren't for his acting. That's where the positive ends. On the negative end, they made Thomas Jane look like a hobo that just got off the train. He didn't look like a farmer at all, he was dirty and Scruffy and looks like he never took a bath. Farmers shave because when they get out there in the hot sun is beating down they don't want all that Scruff on their face trapping the sweat and itching. The script was deplorable. As I said, it was a complete rip-off of The Tell-Tale Heart. There's no way one can get around it, it's blatantly obvious that that's what was done the only clearer way to point that out would be if they literally walled her up in the basement! This storyline arc for the son was just tragic from the very beginning, the poor kid just never had a chance between those two parents, and finding happiness and love with his girlfriend next door at least brought him some Joy for a time, but it was so poorly written, they drag their feet with his story made him sound like he was this complete idiot, and then boom! They tried to make us believe that this 15 year old is all the sudden a man, making man like decisions, and his story line just started moving at a hundred miles a minute! It's like I had to force myself just sit through the first hour and 20 minutes and I kept literally watching and checking to see how much longer I had to sit through this movie it was that awful! I was like how much longer? 30 minutes? Oh God please hurry up! The visuals in this movie sucked, they were dreary colors everywhere, it showed that everyone in the movie I was in Misery all the time no one was ever happy I would have hated my life and wanted to die if I live there and then! They pretty much never left the farm other than a couple quick sequences, so that was pretty miserable! The motivation for the action in this movie was very far-fetched, the duplicitous nature of the father was explained to us through his monologue while he was sitting at the end of the movie writing it in a letter and a hotel room looking back to what we know as the movie. It just didn't work. The whole thing didn't mesh, the tires on this car just fell flat! Whoever did this movie should not do it again! All in all, it's a Netflix movie so you're not exactly paying to see it but you are wasting your time if you try to see it so don't waste your time it's not worth it!",1922
50,CountJonnie,The diversity of Thomas Jane,7,21 May 2018,"Those who know Stephen King, know that horror is only a small part of his writing. The most part is description of characters, relations and development. In this movie adaptation Thomas Jane is a father who convinces his son to help him murder his wife, to save their life and land. Only to discover that this takes a toll on their life, which will slowly crumble down and eat him from the inside.Thomas Jane works in his 3rd Stephen King adaptation and after a number of movies he turns out to be a very compelling and convincing actor. All the so called action, happens in the beginning, after which it is up to Jane to showcase his ability to perform despair, fear, loss of hope and regret. In such a way, that with only a hint of horror, the movie keeps you on the edge. The fact that you know how it ends, doesn't matter. This only gives more power to the sense of an inevitable downfall.A decent story, with good cinematography, great acting and a creepy atmosphere thanks to the brilliant music, makes this a must watch for all fans who can appreciate drama in thrillers.",1922

It's time to crack open a toffee apple cider, eat way too much chocolate and pick my first film.This October I'm kicking off with any films that are classed as horror in my watch list since my watch list is getting uncontrollable at 2,652 films. The first film I've chosen from it was Stephen King's 1922.The first thing I notice in this film is Thomas Jane's acting. Right from the get go, Jane's performance is demanding, it forces you to take view of him and I have to commend him. From the get go, his acting dragged me in, made me sit back and watch even in the opening seconds. He has a very dominant presence - and not in a bad way. He works really well in this role, as domineering of the viewer's eyes as Wilfred James himself.For the film itself... I think this is quite powerful in what it does. The film really goes to show how much a guilty conscience can affect you to the point normal things of a situation can make you paranoid, on edge, how it can twist into much worse in your brain. I think it's done this aspect absolutely perfectly. How Wilfred becomes more twisted, more unsure of himself, more terrified as time goes on is a brilliant display of how the mind can warp and transform as it becomes more desensitised but more on the brink.I do feel this film may have been slightly too long. There isn't too much I'd have said should have been cut out, but maybe just one or two of the more filler type scenes could have gone and I don't think it would have made the film rushed at all.With all that being said, I have to say, I feel let down and slightly disappointed. I can't put my finger on what has left me feeling underwhelmed. For some reason, I didn't feel like I had just watched a horror film or a thriller, I feel more like I just watched a murder mystery. With the horror only really coming into play in the last half an hour, it has a genuine growth into the genre but it just feels slightly lacking.Overall, not a bad film to start Spookathon with, and I feel pretty on edge and grossed out at the implication of the last scene. It definitely makes me want to get a copy of the book and check it out later on. A solid 3.5 out of 5 and I've gained a small interest in director Zak Hilditch. A strong start and for a first look at a director's filmography, a strong presence is already forming for Hilditch.",1922

His whole sanity is being drained by his evil persona, which he refers to as a conniving man.Some people might think that the movie is way too slow, but that's because this movie is based on storytelling.

I felt there just wasn't quite enough content to pull me through.But if you have a longer attention span than I, I think ""1922"" is atmospheric, has rich visuals, and has a very magnetic cast, especially the protagonist father character as played by Thomas Jane, who is utterly believable in his suntan, accent, and menace.I did think the character of the son (Dylan Schmid) was less believable. His role as accomplice and later criminal in his own right had a rationale, granted, but I just couldn't see it in the actor. The character of his girlfriend also felt less convincing to me, given what she later does.I did enjoy the ending message. I recommend this movie for what I did see.

Besides that the movie is beautifuly made and has amazing atmosphere to it, nevertheless slightly ruined by the sheer fact that you simply get bored watching it, it feels too drawn-out, since all the main action happens within the first 20 minutes of the movie.  With the main action being relegated to only the begining of this movie, the viewers get left with a boring, slow paced drama, where a crazy husband and son duo try to cope with the murder of their wife/mother. To be quite honest, there is not much action in this movie, you can clearly tell they are trying to introduce the whole psychological thriller type of vibe here, which does not quite work out that well. Sadly, we do not get to see much of the corn and what happens to it, in the begining i felt the corn will play a much large part in this film, since it was the main object of discussion at the start.  It is still worth seeing if you are into slow-paced, atmospheric movies with great scenery and not much dialogue.

58,Slarkshark,Slow and Steady Despair,7,19 September 2020,"Welcome to farm life in the year 1922. Thomas Jane delivers a mesmerizing and impactful performance as a simple Nebraskan farmer. I've always thought Jane to be a very good actor and this film proves it. You can sense the hate that turns to fear and regret just from his face alone. That drawl accent seemed to be on point, and had me convinced. This is for sure my favourite Stephen King adaptation Jane has been in, the others being Dreamcatcher and The Mist.The film starts off at a fairly decent pace and gets right to business with the main plot in the first act. It's the second and third act that seem to slow down and sends our main character into a downward spiral filled with despair. I may be in the minority here, but I actually preferred the second half. It gets more haunting and takes it's time in completely breaking down Jane's character, till he has nothing left neither tangible or in life.Classic tale of you reap what you sow.

There is a 10 mintue section in this film that is horrific but rest of the film never captured that horror. The sub plot is some what intresting but it feels down played.

Thomas Jane is kinda terrible in this, but not in a way that ruins the movie necessarily. He's a good enough actor, but his accent is not held in check, he chews every word of every sentence as if it's fried and corn fed and his dirt limned constantly makes him seem like a mud man - it constantly takes you out of the movie. This is a fairly straightforward story for the most part, but these stand out as egregious compared to the rest.The whole film could have used a touch more of the surreal, more psychology from the imagery and the presentation, but it still works and its minor flourishes are fine.

Standing in his way is his wife, played by Molly Parker, who has fallen out of love with Jane and wishes to sell her part of the farm and start a new life in a big city.The idea of losing all that he loves in this world keeps twisting in Jane's mind and gut until he becomes twisted enough to manipulate his son into helping him kill Parker. The murder is slow and violent, and Jane has crafted a story that may keep people from asking too many questions about his wife's disappearance. But sometimes, the dead don't stay dead.My most memorable, movie moment of ""1922"" is the scene when Parker's spirit - covered in blood and showing the wounds she suffered at the hands of her husband and son - first comes to Jane.""1922"" is a well-crafted ghost story, moving slowly and methodically, building up the suspense and horror.

Thomas Jane plays a farmer in 1922 trying to get the land willed to his wife. His wife wants no part of the farming lifestyle so he concocts a plan to kill her and take the land for himself.This movie is a slow burn with a very internalized character. There is bits of voiceover that helps put you more into his frame of mind. You feel every bit of sun. You feel every creak in the old farmhouse. You understand where this character is at even though he speaks in such a strong low tone accent. You might have to put the subtitles on in order to get the full gist of what he is saying. He has the vocal patterns of the character in Sling Blade. His world begins to turn upside down and everything he knew and loved is taken from him. This is a solid, creepy film.

Such an amazing performance and change in his appearance from other movies, that I wouldn't have recognized him, if I haven't looked it up on IMDb. The other actors are good too. But Thomas Jane, steals every scene he is in with other actors.The plot is that in 1922, the farmer Wilfreds wife Arlette, is miserable on the farm. She inherits some land and decides to sell it and the farm, move to Omaha and take their teenage son Henry with her. She offers Wilfred a divorce and half the money. Wilfred doesn't wanna lose the farm or Henry. Henry who has fallen in love with a girl from a neighbor farm, also wants to keep the farm and stay with his dad. Arlette wont budge and Wilfred see no other option but to kill Arlette to keep his farm and his son. He persuades his son and together they kill Arlette. After that it all goes to hell. I wont give away anymore of the plot. The time period is nailed right on with the cars, the clothes and the way of life back then. It's creepy as hell very entertaining. Best horror movie, I've seen in a very long time. Even though it's a Netflix original and not a a feature film ,its way better than crap like Annabelle Creation and the likes of it.This is not based on loud noises and cheap jump scares. This is psychological horror. All the people that got bored watching this, are idiots who expect and need cheap jump scares and gory deaths like in the awful Saw franchise, to be entertained. Like Wilfred says in this movie: the city is for fools. Well, Saw and The Conjuring are for fools too. People who have no patience for a real horror movie. Don't listen to their bullshit.

76,Ben-Hibburd,1922 review.,8,20 October 2017,"1922 is a slow, methodical look at guilt and the consequences of moral compromise. Adapted from Stephen King's novella, 1922 is a film that will divide certain audiences. After a summer of successful, suspenseful King adaptations (IT, Gerald's Game), this is almost an anti-king film, it's a film that basks in its atmosphere. It's also a film that's solely focused on its characters rather than plot. Thomas Jane stars as Wilfred James a dedicated ranch owner who conspires with his son Henry (Dylan Schmid) to murder his wife Arlette (Molly Parker) when she starts the process of selling the ranch.1922 is written and directed by Zak Hiditch. Hiditch and his cinematographer Ben Richardson do a wonderful job of nailing the time period. The film's setting is gorgeous to look at, and the homestead has an almost omnipresent feel to it. It becomes a character in and of itself as the corn fields glisten against the backdrop of beautiful sunsets, whilst hiding darker secrets in the cracks of its foundations. The technical aspects of the film are expertly crafted.Thomas Jane is fantastic is his role as a somewhat unhinged man filled with rage and regret. Every time he's on-screen he pulls you in with his mesmerising presence. As the film increasingly focuses on him it becomes more of a character study than a thriller/horror film. Whilst I feel this may be divisive, I enjoyed the direction it took. The films eerie, nihilistic tone makes up for the lack of urgency in the script.1922 is a film that's assured of itself, thankfully being on Netflix the creators don't have to worry about turning this film into a lowest common-denominator jump-fest. Instead it respects its audience and asks them to come along on a journey through the protagonists mind. The only downside with the film is with so much focus given to Jane, the rest of the cast aren't fully developed, and some of their plot threads felt under-developed. However the film does a fantastic job of developing Jane's character which makes up for the short-comings of others. The films attention to detail makes 1922 an effective psychological (horror) film.",1922
77,chris-j-chuba,What goes around comes around,1,8 September 2021,"What goes around comes around. We watch that unfold over 2hrs, as Thomas Jane delivers each sentence more slowly than I've ever heard anyone speak, in some kind of Oakie accent with a very odd look constantly plastered on his face. The look was a combination of 'I'm as earnest as I am unintelligent and thin'. I wonder what people from Oklahoma think of his performance. I can't wait for him to do a character from my state. Anyway, he murders his wife to prevent her from selling the farm and gets away with it, or does he?His son runs away because his dad is manipulative, self-centered, cheap, and comes a bad end.Unable to manage the farm by himself, Thomas Jane sells it for a fraction of what he could have gotten had he let his wife sell it at the start of the movie. She was the smart one but we knew that in the first few minutes of the movie because she had a normal look on her face and no accent (sorry Oklahomans, don't blame me, it's the writers) . He then drinks himself to death, and as he is about to die, he sees a ghoulish apparition of his deceased family. After all this IS a Stephan King movie.Throw in some rats, 1920's dust, cornfields, period buildings, clothes, and you have a masterpiece. The end.",1922

The film score was by Mike Patton and his talent really shows as the score swells and builds to suit what is going on. I loved Thomas Jane - his accent and the layers of dirt on his face & clothes. Molly Parker is also great in this - I loved her in Deadwood. Sure, it builds slow but it is very stark and effective without superfluous sentimental padding. Simple things like the changing look of the lighting as things get grimmer and grimmer for the leading man are tremendously effective. Recommended - but obviously its not an action flick.....",1922
81,JaikrishnaVS,"Slow, boring and not worth the time spend : 1922",5,22 October 2017,"Another weekend and another one of those Netflix originals. The second Stephen King adaptation from the Netflix stable did not live up to the 'above-average' show by its predecessor Gerald's Game. Although a big fan of Stephen King, this is one book/short story that I had not read and should have ideally kept me intrigued throughout as I didn't know the story.However, this crime/drama/horror movie ended up just being a below average crime/horror flick with an average drama quotient. The story-line surrounds ""A simple yet proud rancher in the year 1922 conspires to murder his wife for financial gain, convincing his teenage son to participate. (imdb)"". This is all I can tell about the movie without revealing the very little the movie has to offer. From the word go, the movie was slow, boring and pertaining to a lifestyle I probably cannot fathom 🙂 . The lead actor Thomas Jane was very good in his role, ably supported by Dylan Schmid & Molly Parker. – Nothing really wrong there. However, the script, CGI, direction and story were loose and unappealing. Let me keep things short by saying I have seen a lot better movies in all three genres and I would have skipped this one had I read a review before ! 2/5",1922
82,sanjidparvez,Thomas Jane's one of the finest performances!,8,22 October 2017,"Based on Stephen King's novella of the same name, 1922 is like Stephen King's own version of Allen Poe's timeless classic THE TELL-TALE HEART story that set around here Wilfred James, a Nebraska farmer with a bitter wife named Arlette and a loyal son named Henry. This hardworking but not-too-successful farmer finds himself under increasing pressure from his wife when she clearly started to express her frustrations living in the country and wants to sell her all of the 100 acres of land that she got inheritably and move to the big city. Through their disagreements, when Arlette threatens to divorce him, taking the son with her, Wilfred plots to murder her and methodically persuades his son to become his partner in crime. This is beautifully done, an effectively slow-burn horror-drama directed by Zak Hilditch and like the way Carla Gugino turned GERALD'S GAME into her own showcase of versatile acting talent, this time almost an unrecognizable Thomas Jane delivered one of his best performances in career, IMO. His deeply sincere & committed performance as an early 1920s manipulative, desperate farmer with a slowly rotten psychewas not only an absolute treat but surely this year's one the best so far that deserve some recognition in the coming award season.",1922

I was not impressed however, by some scenes where the lighting was so dim that it was a strain to identify what was happening. While Wilfred James' accent was grating and at times nearly indecipherable, it was not the major distraction or annoyance that some have pointed out.Well acted, produced and directed the film still does not leave any lasting impression on this viewer.

Time were definitely tough during those times and Wilfred's wife, played by Deadwood alumni Molly Parker, wanted to move in the city and sell the land in order to lead a better more joyous life. Alas, Wilfred rather wants to lead a simple pastoral life then working in the city, not allowing the transaction to happen and after committing the sin, he is haunted by visions, rat infestations and supernatural events, where Stephen King's class storytelling can be experienced.Thomas Jane does an exquisite job of portraying the main character, probably giving the strongest performance of his career.

Hundreds of acres of pristine farmland, a thriving crop, a proud father, and blue skies as far as one can see. The husband has plenty to love about life here, except for his ill-contented wife.

All the dark side of human being is exposed but in a year dated back to 1922 ..not in 2017.That makes the movie more impressive.The cinematography of the movie is also very attractive...A farm house full of crops around it like a western picture..Very very eye catching..Reminded me the movie 'The days of heaven"".Those green crops bounded by sands and muddy roads..Blue horizontal sky above..Brown hut shaped well furnished farm houses..With every inch of mindblowing graphics..One of the best aspect of the movie is though it is a horror movie it has less heart beating scenes compared to traditional one.Rather the horror scenes are more cause effective and purposeful..Some are still capable of producing electrical impulse in you..But mostly don't feature the accustomed horror movies i must guarantee it..Finally I haven't read the novel of Stephen King..But my request to those who have read it please don't compare it with the novel.Always writing is better tolerated than acting..And Novels are often far better than the movies.And those like me no comparison with novel freely go for a 1hour 41Minute turbulence of emotions..Darkness and ultimate surprise.",1922

At some points it appeared to be building up some momentum but never delivers. At several points during the movie II nearly turned it off but it seemed to hold my attention just enough that I was able to make it to the endI'm sure many will enjoy this film, it's very different and the Thomas Jane's acting and portrayal of the difficult role of Wilfred James was nothing short of exceptional.

110,albertusjohannesmaria,"1922, the year my father was born",10,9 September 2018,"1922 is a farm drama like I haven't seen for a long time. I grew up myself on a farm and I know, by experience, how farmers are attached to their own properties and especially their land. A farmer who gives up his land is regarded a loser first grade. 
1922 goes deep and dark into the preservation of the tradition that land must go from generation to the next generation within the family. Only the devil can end this. Thomas Jane is fantastic as the tortured farmer going to extreme lengths to keep his son on track. Many scenes are horrifying, yet at the same time black comical. One scene makes me almost vomit, the next I burst out laughing. 
My families farm is destined to end. My brother's sons will never be farmer, not fit to and not able. My brother was offered 1 million dollar by the government to quit his farm. He turned it down. There wont be another offer. How much he will get for selling his 25 acre land within 10 years, we dont know. He is one of the last farmers, which is so strange, because when we grew up all our neighbors had a farm. Nowadays land goes back to nature again, or homes are build on ever growing cities, or it goes to a megafarm with 20.000 animals.",1922

112,madsmartinussen,Dark drama with horror elements,7,5 May 2021,"This was a pretty decent supernatural drama film. I guess it falls under the umbrella of horror, but it's not very scary. It's a simple story of actions and consequences, and the 1922 setting makes it interesting, as does the narration from Thomas Jane. The acting is solid, Thomas Jane's proud farmer with his gritted teeth and southern accent is convincing, and Dylan Schmid does a fine job as the loyal and (only slightly) conflicted son. I guess I was hoping for things to turn out a bit more sinister than they did, but the film succeeds in the way it makes the horrible actions of it's characters seem like just the way things were, back in simpler times, a hundred years ago. These people contemplate their actions in the context of what divine punishment they might find down the road, but their complete lack of remorse doesn't surprise or confuse us, and they don't strike us as being evil or even very unsympathetic. They are just.. simple! And as such, their inevitable punishment turns out to be rather simple too, and ultimately that's what makes the film work.",1922

I'm glad I gave it a watch. It is a wonderful period piece horror set in the depression era farmlands of rural America. It is dark with very few and subtle supernatural horror elements.

116,theopinionatedindian,Worth A Watch,7,21 October 2017,"Stephen King is considered as one of the best novelists in the horror genre & not without reason. Post the stupendous success of IT, Netflix has delivered another movie based on a Stephen King novella of the same name. The movie stars Thomas Jane & Molly Parker of House of Cards fame who plays Arlette James. The movie set in 1922's rural America is about a family of 3 - Wilfred James(Thomas Jane), his wife Arlette & son Henry. The movie is narrated by Wilfred - a farmer who owns 80 acres of land. His wife Arlette has been bequeathed 100 acres of land by her father. While the wife wants to sell all the land & move to the city, her husband & madly in love teenager son have other plans. Wilfred manages to poison his son's mind & conspires with him to brutally murder his own wife. What happens next forms the crux of the story. The movie starts off a bit slowly but picks up pace soon. The movie gets scarier as story proceeds further. The plot is well scripted & will keep you entertained. The characters are well etched & the screenplay is commendable. It does give you a feel of how America was in the 1920's, when it was yet to become the economic & military superpower that it is today. It does provide you a glimpse of rural America & highlights certain aspects of American rural life, hitherto unseen in any other movie. Special mention needs to be given to Thomas Jane for his performance. The movie does fall short in the spooks department. While it does have its share of scary moments, you are likely to be disappointed with the thrills. But if you are a sucker for horror movies, this one is worth watch.",1922

You know you can have a midwestern country accent and still OPEN your mouth right? Keeping your jaw tightly clenched the entire movie, really? Was he trying to mimic Billy Bob Thornton in Sling Blade? I cant remember the last time someone failed so badly at an accent. The horrible casting of Henry, the son. Hes supposed to be 14 but looks and acts 20 y/o. And lets talk about the scene when the mother cries out to her son as he walks to school...""Come back here and kiss your mother!"". Even in 1922 women weren't kissing their 14 y/o sons. And the reason Arlette James wants to sell the land just inherited from her father and move to a big city.... ""She never took to farm life"". She GREW UP ON A FARM! How about .... ""She grew tired of the farm life"".Another overlooked detail. This is a farm family right. Its 1922. But oddly enough Henry so very often looks freshly showered, clean and wearing pressed clothing and supporting a fresh cut. In 1922 people took tub baths, usually once a week, same goes for washing their hair. Look back at photos from that era. Most people, esp 14 y/o boy had greasy hair, often over their ears. And they certainly didn't wear ironed button-down shirts to school. It was overalls.",1922

This movie is not about any random murder, but a terrible terrible one. Every murder is a bad action, but this movie's plot takes it further: a normal man who happened to make the wrong choice, the worst of his life, and the consequences are obvious, and not only to him. Many critics would say that many of the scenes are kind of predictable, and that might be true -that's why it's an 8 and not a 10-, but how the plot develops and the scenes in the 1920s are all perfect that makes the spectator to not care how ""predictable"" the ending will be, which indeed is not at all, at least for me.

123,FallonTimberlake2016,An incredible film with a great lead performance and emotional heft.,10,3 November 2017,"1922 is based off of Stephen King's novella of the same name and centers around a farmer who believes it would be of financial gain to murder his wife. He convinces his son to aid him in the act and the film turns into a story of guilt and secrecy.I did not expect this film to be as great as it was. This film blew me away with its message, with the direction that the story went, and with the lead performance from Thomas Jane. 1922 is typical Stephen King: it looks like a stereotypical thriller on the surface, but if you look a little harder you will find something much more deep and profound. The mental journey that this film takes you on will haunt you, and will definitely make you think about it long after the movie finishes. Thomas Jane delivers the performance of his career, diving so far into his character that no matter how hard you think about it, there is no actor to be found. Neal McDonough also gives a noteworthy performance as Jane's neighbor.The final third of this film had me riveted. For that entire period of time there was a terrible feeling in my stomach that wouldn't go away because of the terrible events that were occurring. By the end of the film, I cared a lot about these characters, despite the fact that they decided to murder their wife/mother. This is an incredible feat to pull off,and is propelled by Zak Hilditch's incredible direction and writing. The only slight flaw I have with this film is that it can be a bit slow, but this is so minor that it is really not noticeable at all. 1922 is one of the best films of the year and contains one of the best lead performances of the year. I very highly recommend seeking this one out. Netflix hit it out of the park with this one.I give 1922 an A.",1922

The story of this movie is bland and forgettable, the basic plot of killing someone and being consumed by visual representations of guilt is done to death (haha) and was not innovated upon much here. I did like the story of the son but the film would have been far more interesting if that plot were focused on more.

127,Vinicius8,"""The Devil grows inside the hearts of the selfish and wicked""",5,10 November 2018,"1922 was a long year, for the characters and for us watching this movie.I wouldn't call ""1922"" a horror movie. Even though some elements in it resemble the genre, I'd say ""1922"" is a drama. To put it simply: The greed of a man puts the lives of everyone around him in jeopardy. From the start we have the facts narrated to us through the voice of Wilfred James, for he recalls the consequences of his greed in the year of 1922.Far from groundbreaking, this movie only surprises in steering clear from common horror and thriller tropes, maintaining a steady pace in its chosen form: drama with psychological aspects. Even though ""1922"" doesn't fails its step into any paradoxal mistakes, there is one unforgivable movie sin we all hate that ""1922"" does commit: being boring.Do I have a problem with slow burning thrillers? Do I like stupid shoot out actions sequences with big explosions and little to no meaning to them at all? NO. I do not. I love, for example, Breaking Bad. And we know it can be a little boring to young fidgety minds. So how's ""1922"" any different? It doesn't deliver. It tells its tale. It ends. And that's about it. There isn't any hysterical emotional breakdowns. Filthy violent repercussions. It's not a pertinent movie.""1922"" drags out its slow burning premise, saved by close call by the narrations, which picks the movie up at just the right times. Even then, it still leaves something amiss. I'm not one to tell how movie is made, but surely it needs SOME kind of impact (surprising, shocking, thrilling, sad, happy) to leave a mark on its viewer. Even a scare would be fine. However, the horror elements are turned into more fuel for the drama - but the mechanism doesn't work, so the fuel is wasted and we are left with an emotional wasteland of boredom.I really wanted to like this movie, but it was just too tidy to be worth remembering.""So when the Devil wants to dance with you, you better say never

Since I automatically compare any King based movie on ""The Shining"", I happened to notice some story similarities. Father with wife and son, descends into murderous activities.

Besides the fact this was written by Stephen King, my writer crush (I'm a writer too), this film dives into so many things. The acting is superb, by everyone. The subject matter in this movie isn't for everyone. Killing your own wife, your mother? The consequences? Only bad things will come.

For the record, Netflix comes out with movies and series quicker than I can brush my teeth, and most are crap. But this, it is a perfect adaptation of King, and every single person in this movie just fits. The chemistry is haunting, as are the deeds, leaving you with a feeling of dread, and an overwhelming sadness for all characters involved. Matricide in and of itself is a horror, and this film will not leave you feeling happy, but you will feel like you didn't waste one moment of your time, it's just a sincere and open look into the mind of a killer, the mind of her husband.

Here. they just decide to stick with exactly what's in the book (I know, like most people, normally I don't personally like film-makers to mess with the original story too much) but there was a real chance to flesh out the Henry/Sharon story, it was like a mini Bonnie & Clyde.
Also, fantastic performance tho it was, I wish they'd just got Thomas Jane to tone down his accent a notch, although very true to the area, like most farmers accents it can be extremely difficult at times to take every word in.

The pacing of the film fails to build to any climactic moment and fails to develop any salient obstacle needing resolution.
The script was utilitarian at best, lacking any human spirit or emotion.
Flat, emotionless, simple.There were some decent metaphoric motifs threaded in the film to give it a literary feel.

152,william_morris,"The devil is in the details, as they say.",4,7 December 2017,"""1922"" is a story with a lot of cinematic potential. In the novella we spend a lot of time inside the characters' minds and that doesn't always translate well to film though the writers on this production do a fair job of picking the important bits so we, the watchers, can at least follow along. The movie takes its time, and that's not for everyone. The production design is where the whole falls apart, though. Leaving off the obvious anachronisms - a Model A car showing up years too early; modern-styled paper money - there are details that distract badly from the story. The sheriff's car (the aforementioned anachronistic Ford) is bright and shiny - as it would have been - but also perfectly spotless. So is the tractor shown not long after: in farmland, especially during harvest, nothing is shiny, and everything is covered in dust, inside and out. The tractor Wilford is shown working on is as shiny as a piece in a museum, not like a working vehicle at all. The two times we're taking to Hemingford City, mountains are visible in the background. If the geography described in the novella is our template (southeastern Nebraska), there are no mountains like that within three hundred miles. Thomas Jane's performance is, as always, fantastic, but his accent is very out of place, pure southern Appalachia; Nebraska was settled by Germans and Russians, and even today, Nebraska farmers don't drawl like that. A reasonable if uneven adaptation that suffered from a lack of attention to detail. It almost gets there, but not quite.",1922
153,jonathancg-12884,Incredible movie. Gotta read the book ASAP!,9,22 October 2017,I loved it from start to end. Thomas Jane gives another excellent performance! The plot is thrilling and makes you want to keep watching even if it's a slow-paced film. It reminded me a lot of old school horror/suspense films from the 80's. The ones that didn't depend on jump-scares or stupid demonic creatures to make the whole movie.Don't listen to those few people arguing the film was boring because it was slow. Maybe they're used to jump-scares and serial killers. This is a very simple but deep plot that is worth seeing.,1922
154,petrun-42039,Challenges moral fiber,7,28 October 2017,"I would have given a 6 1/2 on this movie if it was available. Very slow moving, sometimes very hard to get past the accent on Wilf, the main character. But the movie is a challenge on moral fiber and a lesson on trying to see/consider other options in life when one feels pushed into a corner with the selfish part screaming out. There are other ways. Set in 1922, it does show how decisions we make and their consequences will eventually find us and live with us in the end. The ending makes a lot of sense in this movie, but it takes a long time to get there. Enjoyable, but would not be at the top of my list if I knew more about it.",1922
155,JDreviews101,A sneaky but appealing plan that results in an expected tragedy.,7,1 January 2018,"An overall solid film by Zak Hilditch. I thoroughly enjoyed the way the story was told - the pacing is good, the characters are believable and the plot develops well. Directing, cinematography, editing and production design are all basically spotless. It becomes evident that Hilditch really knows how to properly adapt a good story by setting the right tone and using the adequate elements that always feel organic to the whole thing. The acting in general was just a bit above average, but it easily becomes my favorite Thomas Jane performance to date. For some reason I think it would've had a stronger female lead if Julianne Nicholson had been cast for the role of Arlette instead of Molly Parker. Nonetheless I think she did an acceptable job. If you're in the mood for a nice crime/thriller flick go ahead and give this one a chance. It should not let you down.",1922
156,isiscloud-1,Best of Stephen King Adaptations,8,3 November 2017,"So much of Stephen King's novels/short stories take place inside the heads of its characters so to translate that from book to screen so much can get lost. This one did not. The movie is very faithful to the book, which I listened to. It's in the story collection Full Dark, No Stars. Just watched this and have to say it's remarkable. Thomas Jane is unrecognizable as Wilf James, a farmer living on the Nebraskan country before the dust bowl. His wife wants to move to the city, but he doesn't. It's his wife's family's property, and will never be his, so he decides there's only one thing to do, and brings his son into being a grudging ally since leaving the country would mean leaving his girlfriend who lives in the country as well.This is a very nuanced performance from Jane and all involved in the production, even Neal McDonough, who usually chews through scenery like, um, a rat. This is not for someone expecting an all-out scarefest with a bunch of jump scares or ghoulish creatures. This is a psychological story and will draw you in before you know it. The ending is a little weak, which often happens with King's stories and novels, but the overall story is really worth it.",1922
157,PatrickPlantana,"A ""Roaring Twenties"" blend of drama, suspense, and horror.",8,16 September 2019,"A splash of depressing, a tad psychological, and a hint of crime thriller make up the cocktail that is ""1922"". I like the exploration the film takes into the couple's marriage starting off, especially during the 1920's time frame. We are introduced to an unhappy pair on the verge of a major financial quandary. Unsatisfied with her life, the wife wants to sell her father's land and move to the big city against the strong wishes of her husband whom, legally speaking, has no real say in the matter. It is clear that the marriage has been suffering for sometime by the chemistry (or lack thereof) of the couple as the wife is clearly resentful and the husband feels the lack of love from his partner, in turn becoming resentful himself while trying to preserve his own desires and values.From here, the film gets Biblical and brandishes a heavy psychological sword of manipulation. This phase of the film kicks off with the line ""I believe that there is another man inside of every man, a conniving man."" From here out, the darkness creeps in and doesn't let go. The husband concocts a plan to murder his wife and uses the aid of his teenage son to do it. I was most impressed and disturbed by how well he manipulates his only child to help murder his mother. The misuse of Biblical knowledge and damnation never ceases to amaze me at how well it can emit terrible guilt and actions from people in the name of ""good"" (an undertone of religion and hypocrisy I thoroughly enjoyed about this film). A manipulation that is showcased well as they briefly explore what becomes the son's life soon after the evil deed is done and sets in on his conscience. A select few scenes and blunt dialogue post mortem keep a realistic tone to the messy situation. The initial portrayal of the husband has you believe he is just a frightened, simple man. But as he is threatened by the notion of losing his livelihood and his son, we see the proof of the ""conniving man"" who orchestrates a murderous, evil plot filled with necessary twists and cover ups. Granted it was the 1920's so he had a slight advantage culturally and technologically speaking to get away with this, but as the movie continues we see he is far from being freed of consequence. The raw human take on such a grisly situation and the effect that can have on someone guides us into the second act of the film.The second half of the film takes on much deeper horror themes as we see the guilt and ruin that becomes this man's life. The movie delivers some powerful imagery that, at times, catches you off guard. I like this element as I feel it prevents things from dragging on during parts that could easily get boring as they fill in the little details of the story. A spiral into brief madness helps fuel these more harrowing scenes and jump scares even better, almost skewing the viewer's sense of reality. Perhaps, one of the scarier scenes I've witnessed in recent Netflix horror is where the man's dead wife comes back to visit him. Rats accompany her walking corpse as she stalks her husband through the house in the dead of winter. I love that this scene didn't drop momentum where you almost expect her to disappear as a figment of the husband's crazed imagination, thinking that the director is just trying to scare you. In actuality, this is one of the most pivotal scenes in the film as it lays out the man's punishment for his crimes. It offers a bitter taste as the ghostly woman whispers in her husband's ear telling of all the chaos and destruction he has brought into the lives of multiple innocent people because of his selfish actions. The realism of how things play out for every character is, truly, the most terrifying thing about the movie as a whole. The ending, though not the most original, is probably the most fitting for the dark feel and it offers a terrifying final shot to set the tone. Very well done and entertaining throughout. If you are looking for an original crime thriller with plenty of dark elements check out ""1922"".",1922

But between Thomas Janes oft cited weird mumbled accent, and the slow pace, I found myself tempted to take a snack break without even pausing the movie. I liked the overall story line, with all the real-life and psychological consequences of an act of selfish compulsion. Janes character Wilfred (Willard?) was an uncomfortable presence throughout, somewhere between decent man of the land, and menacing brooder. Maybe that was good acting, but it didn't feel like that. Molly Parker's performance, as also selfish wife Arlette, was much better (at least the alive part).

165,jailbirdtri,"1922 - A haunting story of murder, guilt and trauma.",7,28 October 2019,"Written and Directed by the Australian film maker Zak Hilditch, 1922 is the story of a Nebraskan rancher whose year turns into a nightmare after he conspires and commits the murder of his wife to keep his land with the aid of their only son. Based on the novella of the same name from none other than Stephen King, the movie is a harrowing tale of murder, guilt and trauma seen through the eyes of Wilfred James (Thomas Jane), the conniving man who killed his wife (Molly Parker) taking the help of his son Henry 'Hank' James (Dylan Schmid). The murder itself happens in the first act and the aftermath of their actions leading to the trauma and guilt forms the rest of the story. Thomas Jane delivers a sublime performance as the brooding rancher, talking through his clenched teeth. I loved him in his previous Stephen King adaptation 'The Mist'- a horror movie with an unusual ending. I am surprised of how much of an underrated actor he is. The rest of the cast do their jobs just right, Molly Parker playing the free spirited woman, unusual in those times, who according to Wilf was made by god in that way and Dylan Schmid the kid whose troubles lead him into a life of crime and death. The movie is in no way an easy watch. There are scenes which are bound to make you feel nauseous. But it effectively conveys how people are driven to extreme measures when the life they have known and believe in for their lifetime comes crashing down. But it also emphasizes the fact that there is always another way.",1922

169,hristi_vasilev,A decent take on King's short story of the same name.,7,25 May 2018,"The movie starts with an older version of Jane's character writing down his story in a hotel room seemingly afraid of someone (or something) coming for him. A year prior to this, Wilfred's wife was given 100 acres of land by her father. His wife (played by Molly Parker) wants to sell the land and move to St. Louis and use the money to open up a dress shop. Wilfred is displeased with this news and objects to the suggestion since he sees this land as the perfect place. With both of them on opposite sides on what to do, Wilfred's wife suggests that they should just sell the land and split the profit 50/50 and get a divorce on the condition however that she takes their son with her in the city. It is made clear that they do not enjoy being together anymore as the tension slowly rises from the current events.Wilfred sees that his wife Arlene will not let up on her dreams and selling the farm so he devises a plan. He notices that his son has a liking to the neighbor's daughter and that he loves the farm almost as much as Wilfred himself does so he uses him and devises a plan to murder his wife and keep the farm for themselves.Overall the main plot of the film revolves around guilt. We see Wilfred as he tries do cope with the consequences of his actions and the guilt of his deeds. It shows in a fantastic way how one bad decision can ruin not only your life, but the life of everyone around you. The best part about this movie is definitely the acting. Thomas Jane delivers arguably his best performance as Wilfred, a man who seems like a stereotypical ""dumb, clueless hillbilly"" but is in fact a very terrifying, conniving and cunning individual. He captures his descent into madness perfectly. The cinematography was decent with some very gorgeous shots.The movie is nothing special or groundbreaking but it is still a fantastic film with grizzly and unsettling visuals. It is adapted from King's short story which means that it can be a bit stretched out at times. It captures the source material well but since it is in a different format the pacing is a bit off. But even with the slow pacing the movie did a great job being very tense from beginning to end.",1922

First you have to have a taste for cinema and small details(why the hell is there an upside down chair shown hanging on the wall in many scenes;I think its a metaphor for ghosts and maybe even a metaphor for cinema, things that in real life you interact with and touch but like the upside down chair which is now only for show and not to be interacted with beyond looking at. Understanding this metaphor is key to understanding the film on a deeper level. Also you have to really love art house horror and enjoy more cerebral horror as well. It does have its ghost movie stuff in it it but not like something as boisterous as the conjuring which I liked as well. The sound is creepy as heck. The narration and subtle distortion in the narration is chilling. The way the story is told is creepy. Its just great cinema. And is beautiful to look at. I mean the cinematography is so intense in this. Especially when everything goes black and you just see the ghost. Like i said watch this if you love art house and especially art house horror.

The acting is well done, and the commitment to character is admirable, but I just couldn't handle too much of Wilfred's voice. I can't be the only one who felt this way watching it, right?Zak Hiditch does nice work directing this cast. The setting is beautiful and the homestead sprawling and large. It definitely felt like an isolated location and the Director of Photography Ben Richardson shot it gorgeously.This film is a decent watch, and King fans like me will find enjoyment in it.

176,VeraPopruga,A good novella,7,23 October 2017,"A whole movie about a man, who didn't listen to a woman, ending up dying horribly, destroying lives around him.Casting is spot on. Actors looked organic together. Acting is on point. Thomas Jane, being the star of the movie, respectfully carried his character. However, half the time I couldn't comprehend his words, but I'd say it's more of a 'me' issue. Molly Parker had twice less screen time to show us her character, but still did her job just right. Dylan Schmid is a discovery for me. Playing a supporting role at such a young age can be quite demanding, he killed it nonetheless, no pun intended. All the other supporting actors did their job well. I loved the atmosphere of the sets, yet I wasn't completely convinced about the time setting, looked vague to me. The story could be predictable to the letter, but fortunately, it wasn't. I can't say, if it's thanks to either the original novel or the screenplay, since I've not read the book. Still, the plot gradually progressed, a little surprise here and there, it's well done. The story as a whole gave me Dostoyevsky vibe, which I highly appreciate. I really used to enjoy reading his novels. Also, I like, that the most dreadful part comes from the whole concept of this man single-handedly destroying so many peoples' lives fatally, rather than those 'spooky' corpses. Soundtrack was satisfying, really nice. On contrary to all these advantages, though, the 'rats everywhere' idea wasn't interesting, to my taste. Corpses looked kinda goofy: they gave me more of a smile, than an uneasiness. The thing with adaptations often is, that film makers try to give every detail possible from the original writing, than try and create a finished product, so their works may have a lot of plot holes. This movie isn't the case. I can definitely say, that during watching the movie I haven't had a thought about something being missing in the narration. In conclusion, I think the story may seem ordinary, yet is performed so qualitatively, that I really can't say anything bad about it.",1922

217,jalapablo,"Boring, Predictable, Silly Rehash",2,5 April 2020,"The story is implausible: Farmer James lives with his wife and son on a vast, hundred-plus acre cornfield way out in the boonies of rural Nebraska. The wife wants out of this country-bumpkin lifestyle, and she gets the perfect opportunity to do so when a livestock company offers to buy her part of the land for a pretty penny. So far so good. She decides to take the offer and sell out and move to Omaha, against the protestations of her hard-working yokel husband and son. So, guess what dad and son decide to do? You guessed it -- slit her throat and dump her corpse down a well, of course. I know, I know: it's Stephen King. What did you really expect, right?The resulting theme is banal, boring, and much overused: Think of Creepshow's ""Father's Day"" and ""They're Creeping Up on You"", as well as ""Something to Tide You Over""; think of ""Graveyard Shift"". Also, think of Poe's ""The Tell-Tale Heart"", and H.P. Lovecraft's ""The Rats in the Walls"". Because, after all, what's a good story without rats--and I mean lots of rats--and especially when they accompany reanimated corpses. So, we have lots of rats and a living corpse. Not necessary. We also have a silly Bonnie and Clydesque bank heist subplot tossed in just for the hell of it. The story devices just seemed so, I don't know...forced. The tale is really a character study on guilt and atonement, needlessly seasoned with the aforementioned Gothic-horror elements. The movie drags. Farmer James' mumbling narration and dialogue are nearly indecipherable due to overkill in trying to reproduce an Appalachian hillbilly drawl (in Nebraska?). Despite the overall good acting and atmospheric beauty of the set, I failed to commiserate with any character in this story, and toward the final 30 minutes just found myself wishing the flick would hurry up and end. Before it did though, I dozed off several times, only to awaken here and there mildly annoyed my expectations were not met there, either. Avoid.",1922

This movie personally really messed with my emotions, all the guilt and regret that the characters felt when they killed their wife/mother, I don't know how to explain it other than I just felt terrible, talk about a psychological horror. What I didn't enjoy was the dead coming back to life later in the movie, I'm sure it was just a way to show the protagonist's dive into insanity, but I just think the movie could've done better without it.

That notion is also probably explaining why 1922 is so underrated. Now, not only shows the movie very well acting, its also painting in more or less subtle ways a picture of the mayor problems our societies face right now. 1922 is an allegory for 2017. The character of the farmer embodies very touching the alienation, colonialization, and lack of prospects huge parts of the society experiences with all its devastating consequences (broken solidarities and dreams). That means not only the from the urban culture disconnected rural areas, where making a living is quite hard and the young ones leaving for the city to find there luck there. But also the urban space is not a save place where you can make the American dream reality, rats are eventually everywhere. The bank has always the last word and wins by the misery... ""in the end they catch us all."" The makers of 1922 succeeded to create both a great sociological essay and a political statement at the same time. That alone makes the movie worth watching.",1922

Thomas jane performance was amazing 9/10
Molly parker performance was not complete ( as the focus on the protagonist) 6/10

All we know about characters' intentions is when they literally say them aloud in 1 line they have, zero character development for their motives. Despite its abrupt start, the film has an incredible slow pace after which lasts for the whole piece. You will hesitate whether to give it another 5 minutes before it gets interesting or just stop watching all together.If you do watch the whole thing, you'll have the poorly written narration almost ruin the story. Moreover, even though it pretends omniscience there are many parts where you will never understand why things happened the way they did. Why did he involve his own son in the actual murder? What was the point of having cover her face with a bag? Why didn't he just shoot her in her sleep instead of clumsily try to cut her throat? Why does his son change his mind afterwards? There's no character development of him on why he so easily accepted to murder his own mother and then regrets it. At least the 30-second fast forward story of him and his loved one as Bonnie and Clyde is more interesting than the rest of the film and almost makes up for it.It shows they put hard work on the setting but sometimes it's a little unbelievable. Characters' clothes are either way too brand new or way too dirty and raggedy. Same goes for furniture, cars or even windows. The photography leaves a lot to be desired with overly close shots that don't let you buy the setting at times. The farmwork they seem to do is also inconclusive and even when they finally harvest the maize field, it keeps appearing as background in some scenes.The plot is full of holes and how certain things happened are unclear or simply not shown at all.I regret seeing the ""based on the Stephen King novel"" and clicking play, I'll be careful to avoid that if I'm looking for a quality film.",1922

Trust me, Nebraskans do not have accents like those portrayed in the film. What you hear in the film is more like southern Missouri hill country or Northern Arkansas accents. Nebraskas are likely to sound more like southern Minnesotans than hill country folks.

254,abeastgirlgamer,Solid adaptation of a Stephen King novel,8,16 January 2019,"The movie 1922, directed and written by Zak Hilditch, is a psychological thriller adapted from Stephen King's novella of the same name. 1922 follows a rural farmer, Wilfred James, and his confession to conspiring to murder his wife for his own gain. This premise becomes more and more macabre as he eventually recruits the help of his son, and learns that what is dead and gone can still have unforeseen consequences. This chilling film is propelled by its deeply unsettling premise and strong purposeful acting, making it one of the best Stephen King adaptations in recent memory.
This film starts with a scruffy Wilfred James entering a hotel and beginning to pen a confession. He confesses that he murdered his wife, Arlette James, in 1922 with the help of his 14 year old son, Henry James. His narration of this tale acts as a solid backbone for the rest of the film, however questionable his perspective may be at times. Once his wife's father dies, Wilfred learns that his wife will inherit the 100 acre plot adjacent to his own 80 acre farm. Wilfred, wanting to have this land for his son to inherit, implores his wife to keep the farm. Arlette instead insists on selling the land she inherited, and even pushes Wilfred to sell their own land and move to the city. Wilfred is personally offended by this. As a simple farmer, farming is all he knows, all he wants to do, and he convinces his young son to think the same way. A seemingly plain and kind man, Wilfred manipulates his son into agreeing to help him murder his own wife for the land she inherited. Her husband and her son get Arlette drunk, and brutally and messily murder her in her own bed. Wilfred and Henry take her body and then dump her down a well. Although she's dead, Arlette and her influence still follow Wilfred and Henry around from beyond the grave, showing these conniving men that their actions have terrible and unforeseen consequences.
This creepy and jarring film has incredible momentum from the actors playing Wilfred and his son Henry. Wilfred (Thomas Jane) is electrically constructed as a tight-jawed, no nonsense typical farmer from the era, and his inner turmoil and fear throughout the film is completely captivating. Henry (Dylan Schmid) is portrayed perfectly as a naive boy who can easily be manipulated by a trusted older authority figure. These two actors carry most of the film as the main characters, and add a depth to the movie that is one of a kind. This film is one of the better Stephen King adaptations, having a good balance of film aspects to build upon the original story to bring it to life, all while still relying on the strong material behind the film itself.
Days after he murders his wife, Wilfred and his son are approached by the lawyer of the company which originally planned to buy Arlette's inherited land. This scene showcases how director Zak Hilditch can create something gripping and immersive. Full of slow, dramatic pans across a corn field, intense close up shots, and propelled by the simplicity of the scene, this portion of the film stands out wonderfully. When questioned about his wife's disappearance, Wilfred, even though it's apparent that he's baking in the hot summer sun, is cool as a cucumber, playing off this disappearance as a marital issue where Arlette ran away out of discontent. When questioned further, the camera zooms in even more onto both the lawyer and Wilfred, and the scene becomes tense and full of potential energy and sweat, waiting for someone to slip up. Instead, Wilfred smoothly brings his son into his own lie, defusing the situation, and eventually things calm down. With this, the camera zooms back out, and the overall feeling of the scene is one of relief, of gratitude that their lie worked. Hilditch works perfectly with these rapidly changing emotions throughout the scene with stealthy camera work and hostile and ever changing music. Many of the tense moments throughout the film are expertly executed, similarly to this sequence.
Many aspects of this film can easily go unnoticed, but purposely so. The clothing of the main characters are plain and utilitarian, and the scenery mostly focuses on a farmhouse and the acres and acres of corn surrounding it. These ordinary things line up with the setting like clockwork, making Wilfred seem like a typical harmless farmer in the middle of nowhere, not a man who could conspire to kill his own wife. The music blends into the background of each scene, purposely building and eliminating tension with something as simple as a key change, and these transition are practically unnoticeable as they blend in so easily into the film. The establishing shots of the scenery around the house are beautiful, but utterly unassuming and ordinary. The simplicity behind most of the film, the simple close up shots to establish tension, the simple tattered costumes, the lack of most special effects and makeup, just adds to the background of Wilfred as just a farmer who made a mistake, not a murderer.
Even during the lulls in the movie, it's still enthralling and pulls you in. Some portions of the film are slower, especially towards the ending, but if the viewer is properly captured by the film, these slower scenes just add to the creepiness and unsettling nature of the film as it follows the consequences Wilfred and Henry face. This movie is more full of psychologically uncomfortable moments compared to boring jump scares that some horror or thriller movies have. Newer directors like Ari Aster, the director of Hereditary, may instead rely on this cheap tactic to get hearts racing with the thrill, and not with the horror and fear that lies behind the film. In 1922, the overall premise is strong enough to not need any jump scares or tactics, and instead have the essence of the film shine through.
This first class psychological thriller will often have viewers on the edge of their seats to see what new horrors will plague the James family. 1922 will capture all viewers with the perfectly paired beauty and horror throughout the film.",1922
