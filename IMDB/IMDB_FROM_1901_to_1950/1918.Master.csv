0,SAMTHEBESTEST,"Master is out an out massy mania made only and only for entertainment, no matter how it comes.",5,16 March 2021,"Master (2021) :
Brief Review :Master is out an out massy mania made only and only for entertainment, no matter how it comes. Whatever bashing the film has recieved till date is simply unacceptable for two reasons. One, it is not a bad film at all, so just forget that Crap tag and two, who are those movie pandits who even kept high expectations from it? I mean when you see a trailer you realise what kind of movie it is going to be, right? Like when you watch Avengers trailer you know it is going to be a an entertaining film, not a content oriented stuff so of course you can't expect a film like The Dark Knight or Shawshank Redemption from it. Master clearly indicates a pure mass hysteria from trailer and that's what it delivers. An alcoholic professor aka Master is sent to a juvenile school, where he clashes with a gangster who uses the school children for criminal activities. At first even I was expecting a bad film but unexpectedly it started off so good and it kept me going steady with the attention for almost 90 minutes. It was such a pleasing mainstream filmmaking from Lokesh because many scenes in the first half were very high in Cinematic proportions for this genre. Then, somewhere towards the end it dragged and had me thinking that yes it has some flaws but still it's a fair enough deal overall. Such films aren't watched for acting and quality filmmaking so i don't know how fair it is to talk about those things here. Still, Vijay vs Vijay face off is impressive. Master has some terrific action scenes and massy statements that can be enjoyed by mass lovers. Although it has few things unsettled and scattered like Romance, backdrop and political reference, the overall gesture is certainly enjoyable. Don't believe the overhyped hatred, Master is above average and pretty much watchable for its genre.RATING - 5/10*By - #samthebestest",Master
1,arungeorge13,"A tale of two halves, with a more enjoyable first and a mostly generic second! [+54%]",5,30 January 2021,"Two aspects made me sit through the 3-hour long Master. One's the cracking background score by Anirudh and the other's the casually intimidating villain act from none other than Vijay Sethupathi (who plays juvenile-turned-dreaded-gangster Bhavani). The biggest question here, like in most cases when a director (Lokesh Kanagaraj, in this case) who's had a strong, crafty couple of outings decides to direct a star (Thalapathy Vijay) vehicle keeping all of its star-trappings intact, is the proportion of the director's and superstar's stamps. Lokesh (with his admiration for Scorsese and Tarantino) and Vijay (who's ridden the star wave by consistently saving people in his films) seem like a match made in heaven, on paper.Professor J.D is the kind of character we know little about, a change from the overly spoonfed Vijay characters of yesteryears. He's quite good at what he does during the day, but post 6 PM, he's drunk and dozing. Bhavani, on the other hand, gets a meatier build. He channels the wrongdoings done against him as a teenager to concoct a whole saga of crime (and criminals), in the process, ascending gangster ranks. He uses kids at the juvenile home to run his dirty errands, feeding them basic comforts and a whole lotta dope. When these two behemoths clash, it should feel like a battle of the Titans. Whether it does is another question altogether. That's the kind of film Master is. There's so much that works on paper, but not quite on screen.Master is a suave-looking film, with fabulous colour grading and overall visual style. Plus, we also get Anirudh's best work in a couple of years (since Kolamaavu Kokila), with the background score SO DARN integral to making several otherwise-generic shots play out better. The songs too, are wonderful. Lokesh places some of the songs (like 'Kutti Story') at appropriate junctures, while some (like 'Antha Kanna Paathaakaa') are just sort of there. Now, we all know Lokesh for his staging of set-pieces. In Master, however, it's a mixed bag. There's a set-piece breaking out literally every 15-20 minutes, be it concise or extensive, making you think that brawling it out is all that the film offers as a solution to most problems. Some of it is crafted sufficiently well, though I wouldn't say they have the same recall value of what I witnessed in Kaithi.And we're talking abuse against children here, once the film shifts from its jolly college setting to a shady juvenile home. To extract an extra dose of sympathy, Lokesh resorts to some imagery that further stigmatizes juvenile homes and how they operate. That all of this goes down in the film's second half (when it fully embraces its Vijay film tropes) doesn't help either. Bhavani's punchy antics are what keep the film mostly afloat, and it makes sense that Sethupathi gets the best lines. There are so many supporting characters that fleetingly appear and disappear without purpose, when the film turns 180 in the latter half. Arjun Das, with his baritone voice, manages to leave a bit of an impact, while the rest, including the film's apparent heroine (Malavika Mohanan), have little to do.I did enjoy the writing in Master in bits & pieces - the heroine-saving scene is nicely subverted. The scene where Bhavani and J.D encounter each other for the first time is also quite fun. By the time the film gets to the climactic showdown, as exciting as it is to watch the two Vijays fight it out, the emotional payoff is minimal. As a result, Master is a film that gives you a fleeting sense of exhilaration, not the satisfaction of a wholesome meal. A couple of good appetizers and a palatable dessert can't make up for a largely insipid main course!",Master
2,Prashast_Singh,A typical Vijay action movie. And a sign things are starting to get normal.,10,31 January 2021,"I have never missed any of Vijay's releases in the last few years, and that alone should confirm I'm a big fan. He has arrived this year with a new action entertainer called MASTER, and needless to say, it's his usual stuff, and that's a good thing, because his ""usual"" stuff in my opinion is really good value for money. You can spend three hours replete with his ""mass"" hero charisma, hair-raising elevation moments, crazy dance moves and above all, breathtaking action sequences, and won't regret it. Especially when life in the last few months has turned upside down for so many of us.In that case, seeing Vijay playing another action hero role where he fights, dances, delivers at least one intense speech and even makes you cry, is a sign that life is starting to come back to normal. I have to appreciate the makers for going ahead with the theatrical release and then not waiting to release it on OTT because that way, both them and us viewers are satisified. Director Lokesh Kanagaraj doesn't really give you another one-night story as he did in Kaithi, but adds his own touch to the typical Vijay film by toning down subplots, only hinting at romance instead of devoting a whole first half to it and focusing on adrenaline-fueled violent action that doesn't shy from being gory and crunchy, although only as per plot demands.The music here is equally praiseworthy as it keeps elevating the film to sky-high levels from time to time. Be it the emotional or the action-packed moments, Anirudh Ravichander deserves applause for his top-notch compositions. As for the performances, Vijay of course is in his usual mass avatar and lives up to the character. He's indeed one of the reasons to watch this film and his expressions continue to impress here. Vijay Sethupathi is truly menacing as the antagonist, and gets to have an intense screen presence at the same time. Arjun Das performs brilliantly and there are times you will hate his character. Malavika Mohanan's performance and characterization come across as a breathe of fresh air, both in terms of execution and delivery. Andrea Jeremiah surprisingly doesn't have much to do for the most part, but is impressive whenever she's on screen.On the downside, Master's climax (not the ending) is a bit of a letdown. I know that this is a just a popcorn action movie and not some investigative crime thriller that requires you to think, but some of the dialogue in the climax is pretty cliche and disappointing, especially when you've been treated to such a great characterization for the rest of the film. Nevertheless, that's just one flaw. The film was indeed long, but again, props to Kanagaraj for not needlessly stretching the film. It's long only because there's an actual story going on.Overall, MASTER is a full-on treat for action lovers all over the world. You get three hours of nonstop action without holding back, and a lot more only Vijay fans will better understand. Since it's on Prime now, I'd recommend watching it if you like the genre or any of the leading actors. Trust me, the way Kanagaraj has breathed life and freshness into a typical hero-villain story is a proof that ""mass"" action movies are here to stay, and perhaps just the need of the hour. If you are new to this kind of fun, give it a try. If you're used to it, you still won't regret spending close to three hours with another Vijay ""master""piece.",Master
3,nadkarnisumeet,Clash of two Vijays!!,8,2 February 2021,"Master (Tamil) review :The big ticket Pongal blockbuster which literally kick-started the ailing exhibition business down South (post Covid pandemic) premiered online on Amazon Prime last Friday just two weeks after its theatrical success. Whether in a cinema hall or your own home theatre, Master spearheaded by Thalapathy Vijay and Vijay Sethupathi is an out and out action packed entertainer worth your time and money. No doubt about that!!Yup, there are plenty of cheer-worthy moments here to satisfy both the Vijay's fans. Most importantly, the film's basic theme and screenplay is unique and thoroughly engaging even with its run time of close to three hours.Playing an alcoholic master assigned to reform a juvenile prison, Thalapathy (meaning Leader) Vijay is super cool whether telling a ""kutty"" story to his rowdy students or arousing their conscience in the penultimate scene. Top class!!Vijay Sethupathi, as the ex- juvenile convict turned gangster Bhavani, is a perfect foil to his namesake co-star and his characterization of a street smart toughie is simply awesome. The guy is totally rocking as a goon who can knock out anyone with just a single punch. In one scene, the film portrays him like a devil with horns - the way it is done will surely bring a smile on your face.The film's highlight includes some superbly executed action sequences specially the climax, Anirudh's aptly tuned score and last but not the least, the style and swag of the two warring Vijays. I loved their first meet and the interesting tyrst with a pen. Haha!!Dont miss Master - theatres or OTT. This one is a hit boss!!Regards,
Sumeet Nadkarni.",Master
4,saru2020,Not a Vijay film but a VS film,4,2 February 2021,"Either it should've been a Vijay film or Lokesh's film, mixing up both is like mixing beer & hot and if you know how the body reacts when both are mixed, then you already know the output of this film. VS scored well with his usual casual attitude & Anirudh's music was good but nothing else seemed to have worked out. Vijay, Andrea, Shantanu and everybody else were simply wasted out, maybe it because of the overload of the characters and that's why none of those characters made an impact.
Finally, this is more like a VS film than Vijay's film, wondering how Vijay let it to happen but it is definitely a welcoming one.
Just simply no characterisation at all to Vijay's role was the stupidest idea that the team has done here, the stupidest idea EVER.",Master
5,Azanspy,The usual.,4,13 January 2021,Lokesh Kanagaraj didn't bring anything new to the Vijay Cinematic Universe. Makkal Selvan>>>>Thalapathy in this.,Master
6,vjnambu,Vijay vs VJS,8,1 February 2021,"Master's biggest plus point is vijay sethupathi. If bhavani's character was played by a normal actor, he would have been clearly overshadowed by thalapathy vijay. But since its vjs, the character is well written and is shown equally powerful than hero. We can't call him villain instead an antihero.
Another plus point is anirudh's music and bgm which stood as the backbone of the film. Thalapathy vijay performed as usual for his fans.
Color tone was perfect.
But the film is very predictable and lacks logic for example an alcoholic person quits drinking without any proper treatment.
On the whole, master is a blasting entertainer mainly due to vjs act as the ruthless gangster which makes it for me a better vijay film after a long time. First half is mainly dominated by vjs but second half is thalapathy show all the way. Those who expected to watch it for director will be disappointed but i kept those expectations away and enjoyed the film throughout.",Master
7,aastikhimta,Great acting by Vijay again,7,30 January 2021,A good and different kind of plot with some new story. Yes there were some weak CGI scenes but atlast it's a good movie which you can watch with your family.,Master
8,sriramthestranger,Best of Vijay & VJS!!,9,18 January 2021,"This is the movie after Kaththi where Vijay has shown he can acted as a character rather than the conventional 'do-good-save-people action hero'. He has portrayed the nuances of alcoholic Professor even in short montages and dance steps. On the other hand, there were certain parts that looks unnecessary and added purely for entertaining fans. Hence, it looks odd at certain places. Overall, its a terrific entertainer from Lokesh and team!!",Master
9,shovonbhattachrjee,Superb story with superb acting,7,23 February 2021,The storyline of this movie is just amazing and acting is also superb. The Action of this movie is also mind blowing. Overall this is a very good movie.,Master
10,akhil027,A decent VIJAY movie,6,29 January 2021,"You know what to expect when you watch a Vijay movie. The only difference from the usual Vijay movies is the space given to Bhavani(Vijay Sethupathi).
I didn't have much expectations so the movie was not disappointing.
I felt like the script needed so much refinement.
First of all, they should stop treating Vijay as a superstar within the movie. He should play the character not Vijay. The choreography in dance numbers were really disappointing. I'm waiting(pun not intended) for a dance number like Ella Pugazhum. Andrea's character is an example of poor writing. They just placed the archery scene for the sake of that chase. It could've been executed better. And Gayathri should've been just another teacher who plays an important role in the plot. Making her fall in love with Vijay was really cringe. Songs were poorly placed. Especially Antha Kanna Pathakka. It interrupted the flow of the movie. I expected better action scenes too. Vijay is one of the best(and few) Indian actor who can easily handle action.
It's Vijay Sethupathi's Bhavani who steals the show. He's brilliant and terrifying villain who talks in a polite manner. The way he belittles the protagonist's emotions was really good. It's the long and nearly ridiculous scenes in the climax what kills the mood.",Master
11,dhavalpithwa,Master The Blaster,9,3 April 2021,Vijay And Vijay Show Awesome Movie With Aniruddh Background Score Just An Epic Lokesh Kangaraj Direction Super Full Too Action Movie....,Master
12,gk303007,Just another action flick,7,31 January 2021,"I watched this movie on OTT. It is a 2 hrs 57 mins long drama about a students' Professor and a Lorry Union crime lord. And a bit of morals, here and there. Let me jump to what i liked:1. Some good action sequences.
2. Some lighthearted comedy scenes. Quick ones.
3. Vijay's personality, as usual, reflects in the movie and he did his job well.
4. Vijay Sethupathi's bland acting. Really, sometimes you don't need to sprinkle your charisma and it comes out just fine. This guy was impressive.
5. Kid Undhiyal's acting. His dialogue delivery and comic verbs were amazing.Now, what as per me could have been better or I didn't like:1. Duration. Rather being a 2 hrs 57 mins long, it could have been wrapped within 2 hours something or another 10 minutes.
2. Story. Even if there were good moments, yet i felt neutral to it. I mean, i had already watched tons of such stuff before, and i wasn't surprised at all.
3. Action. Even if good, still a lot. And i don't feel it was really required.
4. Lack in thrill and mystery.Anyways, still a worth effort by creators. I will rate it 7 out of 10.",Master
13,rahul000994,MASTER : Vijay V/s Vijay Show !!!,10,1 February 2021,"The film is the story of JD (Thalapathy Vijay), a drunkard professor who gets transferred to a juvenile home. There he meets kids who are involved in drugs and alcohol by Bhavani (Vijay Sethupathi), a local king-pin. The story then showcases how the two forces collide and who wins the battle between the two.The film has great acting performances, terrific background music, fantastic action sequences. The total feel of the film is of a mass entertainer which is made for the audiences to watch in the theatres.Acting performance by both the Vijay's are the highlights of the film. Thalapathy Vijay plays to the gallery and enjoys his presence on screen. He is simply terrific and enjoyable to watch. Vijay Sethupathi is brilliant as the drug-lord of the area and he makes you love him with his performance. His scenes with Vijay (telephonic and fight sequence) are mind-blowing. Anirudh as the music director is the fantastic and the BACKGROUND MUSIC of the film will take your breathe away.Overall, MASTER is a complete entertainer and a mass-monster, which is enjoyable from the first scene itself. Both the VIJAY'S makes sure that you enjoy the film till the last minute and off course the remarkable performance of both of them.",Master
14,vinayshri,Good story but a bit slow paced!,8,25 March 2021,As a avid series and movie viewer I can this movie came up with a new concept and shows the reality of the world however the college election part was completely unnecessary. The film was slow paced which results losing grip of viewer toward story. The direction was good and cinematography was absolutely Fine. Everyone should watch it once. Thank you.,Master
15,Harshithnagraj,Good watch,8,14 January 2021,Not a best show from director but still I loved villan than hero in this film. Both Vijay rocks in this movie. And that music is really next level. Kanagraj didn't touch his potential but still a excellent movie.,Master
16,magadalwarmayur,Not bad not good,7,30 January 2021,It's somewhere in the middle and it could have been shorter.,Master
17,isaacsundaralingam,"Wait, why was the first hour even in the movie?",4,8 May 2021,"The first hour had absolutely nothing to do with the story and doesn't even contribute to the lore or the character developments in any meaningful way. I mean, it wasn't boring, but it makes no sense when you think about it.The only good thing I can say about this movie is that Vijay Sethupathy's character Bavani was crafted and developed pretty well. And his acting (as always) did fair justice to the character. Everything else was either sub-par or straight up cringe.The final act; especially the last half hour was laughably bad. Because right up to that point, Master while not ""good"", was at least not boring. And man, the three-hour runtime just feels stretched super thin by the time you're at the climax.Overall, I didn't hate it because it was to some extent enjoyable, but I found very little to actually like and come back to about this movie.",Master
18,zkzuber,Khan Review,2,16 August 2021,"What a hopeless movie, full of over acting. Doesn't deserve even two star. Any one enjoying such trash should be brave enough.",Master
19,TreeFiddy53,"Vijay fans would be happy. I am not one, but I didn't feel like I wasted 3 hours. Only...1.5 out of those 3 hours, though.",6,29 January 2021,"Pros - I'm glad that this movie wasn't the typical Vijay movie, glad there were no ""love songs"" for a change, glad Nayanthara wasn't brought in to do the female lead, if this movie had a female lead to begin with. I enjoyed the choice of music and the background score. Some sweeping shots in the movie were good. Vijay's character, for a change, was slightly closer to a real life person so I assume people could have related to him a tad more. Vijay Sethupathi (VS) was his usual self in the movie, same tone, same delivery, same nakkal here and there. But it was refreshing to have a thug villain who wasn't loud for a change.
A lot of people said VS carried the film on his shoulders when this was supposed to be a Vijay movie, did we even watch the same movie? I thought this was neither a typical Vijay movie, not a VS show. I'm fine with the balance the movie had.
Cons - It was too long. 3 hrs is way too much time for a movie that doesn't have six 5 min songs every now and then. That college part got done in about an hour, and THEN the actual story starts? WTH man! Almost all of the cast from the 1st hour felt only useful enough to give haircuts and clean up the school? Wut?
Nayanthara illa, why was Andrea there for 3 scenes? Might as well have had Charu fill those parts. I'd much rather see the fist-fight from this climax than a ""solti-solti-adichan"" fight, but dude, some parts of that fight were cringe, the kid almost got kidnapped, and now avan thattu la thaalam podran ah!? A death match is going on, and they stop mid-way to for comedic dialogues? Felt like DC trying to be Marvel. You only get a chuckle, a forced one.
Overall - Vijay fans would be happy. I am not one, but I didn't feel like I wasted 3 hours. Only...1.5 out of those 3 hours, though.
I'm glad I didn't have to spend $30 to watch this in the theater though. Indha padathuku ah da Coronavirus nadoola 100% theater attendance ku sandai poteenga? *smh*",Master
20,arjun-tkalathil,Cant tell average too!!!,5,29 January 2021,"Just enjoyed first 45 mins and Vijay sethupathi portions, without him Master is a waste of time! Nothing new to offer and to be entertained!",Master
21,aji4u4ever,This is not a Lokesh Movie,4,13 January 2021,"OKAY. OKAY..Much awaited Master is here.I've had huge expectations since the combo was deadly Vijay Sethupathi - Vijay - Lokesh Kanagaraj all in package.Story revolves around a juvenile correction center controlled by Bhavani and a drunk college lecturer is sent there to save all the inmates from the gangster. Well, the story itself is similar to many Malayalam / Tamil Movies, but all I cared about the director who brought us Kaithi & Maanadu and I had all hopes on himWriting was lame and too much addition of illogical scenes and crafting. Narration was also in bad shape and was not engaging. First half was average and was expecting a mass in the second half but ended up as below average. Comedy scenes were enjoyable and the action scenes were well choreographed and was a treat.Anirudh's music and background score was average and was okay-ish at some parts.Malavika Mohanan looked pretty but don't have enough screen space to perform.Vijay was okay with his performance but I felt his character was like half baked.I was expecting some real bad-ass performance from Arjun Das but he has nothing to do with the movie. Shantanu, Gowri, Andrea, etc. were totally wastedVijay Sethupathi stands tall with his massive villain performance. He was absolutely brilliant in his dialogues, attittude and the brutality.Long story an average to below average for me.4.5 on 10",Master

After kavalan & thuppaki, vijay in a different shade. Vijay was shown in a new mannerism,cool and swag. Vijaysethupathi Scored as a teraffic villain through his acting.
Lokesh Perfectly balanced the Script with what are all needed for a multi star film.
A pongal treat for everyone. Nly negative 2nd length, if few scenes trimmed means it would have been more better.",Master
24,ahamedmn,AWESOME🔥🔥🔥,9,13 January 2021,Good movie with Racy Sceeenplay and 1st half. Thalapathy and Vijay Sethupathy has played Hero and Villain superbly. A Mass Commercial entertainer with Lokesh's signature. Background score was tremendous. Some logic loophole in 2nd half. On the whole its a Perfect Action packed Movie with comedy elements and Superb Violence.,Master
25,kumarankulam,Master is a film that mainly depends on the brilliant performances of Vijay and Vijay Sethupathi which will keep you engaged till the end,7,31 January 2021,"After proving his mettle as a filmmaker in his previous outings Maanagaram and Kaithi, Lokesh Kanagaraj is uniting with Vijay and Vijay Sethupathi in Master for the first time which is touted to be his first big commercial film. Personally, I felt that Master was a good action thriller with some fan moments to cherish. First of all, Vijay is not the typical superhero that he uses to be. In most of his films, he is seen as a savior and as a righteous man who fights for justice and gives strong advice to people around him but in Master, he is slightly different. Vijay is playing a flawed hero. He is an alcoholic college professor who lacks seriousness in life and doesn't even listen to people around him. Well, it's actually refreshing to see Vijay being different on screen. His mannerism and his attitude in the first half would be a treat for the fans. Unfortunately, his transformation in the latter half loses the freshness and the uniqueness that the character had previously and people might feel missing that too. On the whole, Vijay's performance is definitely one of the best in his career so far. On the other side, we have the evil Bhavani played by Vijay Sethupathi. Honestly, Vijay Sethupathi's performance adds so much intensity to the film and it's interesting to watch him play it effortlessly. It has been a while that we have witnessed a menacing evil in a Vijay film that is able to pull the hero down with his evilness. JD has several moments where he loses to Bhavani which makes the overall narrative interesting. Believe it or not, Bhavani is easily one of the best villains in Tamil Cinema and Vijay Sethupathi's performance is simply brilliant. One of the disappointments that I had in Master, it's the lack of importance to the supporting actors. The much-expected actors that were thoughted to have strong roles are unfortunately left with minimal screen time and with less scope in the overall plot. Thankfully, we have Arjun Das, Poovaiyaar, and Master Mahendran who contributed a lot in surprising the audience with their brilliant performances. After his memorable role in Kaithi, Arjun Das is back as another antagonist in the film and he plays a huge part in bringing down Vijay in the latter half. Not to forget that Arjun Das's voice adds that much-needed evilness to his character. If we have Vijay as the main hero, we have Poovaiyar playing the second hero in the film. Yes, there's a particular scene where Poovaiyar shows his heroism while Vijay taking the back seat. It's definitely a delight to watch on screen. His mannerisms are unique and enjoyable. Just like Poovaiyar, we have Master Mahendran who plays a surprising and memorable role in the first 15 mins of the film which is phenomenal. Anirudh's background score and songs are a huge pillar for the film. They add so much color and power to the film. It even helps in lifting the mass screen presence of Vijay and Vijay Sethupathi. The festive mode creator ""Vaathi Coming"" & the motivational ""Kutti Story"" are placed very well in the film and they are visually pleasing. Special mention for the amazing remix of the Kabaddi song from Ghilli. The action sequences in Master are grounded and slightly realistic like Lokesh said in his promotional interviews. Especially, the interval fight, the Kabaddi fight, and the climax fight strictly fan moments. The stunt choreography in the metro fight was fresh and well done. The climax fight between Vijay and Vijay Sethupathi will be remembered forever for the equal importance on screen and their impressive mannerisms. I personally felt that Master had some issues with its run time. Watching a film for 3 hours is not that easy because there's a big chance to lose the patience that we had initially and that's the main problem in Master. There're some scenes that could have been cut down to make the film racy and engaging. I also felt that the emotional connectivity didn't work in this film. The scenes where Vijay cries for the first time in the jail is a great performance but left ineffective. Let's come to Lokesh Kanagaraj. In his previous interviews, he mentioned clearly that this film is a 50% Vijay film and a 50% Lokesh film. Well, after watching Master, I really feel that he is right. There are fan moments and iconic Vijay mannerisms that he added to satisfy the core Vijay fans like the Kabaddi fight which is a major throwback to Vijay's Ghilli. He also added his well-known director signature like the first 15 mins that he used to introduce the antagonist and to establish the main core plot of the film. As a director, Lokesh has delivered a film that would satisfy Vijay fans but I'm not sure if it would work for his fans who loved his previous works. In terms of writing, Master shines at very few places and has moments that are left unimpactful due to the fact that there's a lot of compromises that Lokesh has to make for Vijay. Overall, Master is a film that mainly depends on the brilliant performances of Vijay and Vijay Sethupathi which will keep you engaged till the end.",Master
26,grarunkumar1994,FINALLY..!! An enjoyable Vijay Film.!!,9,15 January 2021,"Vijay had been struggling with monotonous scripts, a formulaic set of mannerisms, dialogues and even song placements. One film that broke this curse and resurrected Vijay was ""Thuppakki"", in 2012. ""Master"" does just the same. After a series of irritating films like Bhairava, Mersal, Sarkaar, Bigil that portrays Vijay as a superhuman that dances in the middle of highways, punch umpteen goons and making them bounce on concrete floors, acting that fails to connect to audience nor story, and lack of the latter, Master not only provides a decent plot, interesting screenplay and good song placements, it even makes fun of previous films of the star.
Lokesh Kanagaraj, the writer director of this film needs no introduction. Managaram was good , but Kaithi was something that proved this is a man of talent.
Master is a mix of 2 basic plots - the quest & overcoming the monster. The quest is something that needs to be experienced on screen. The monster is portrayed very well by Sethupathi, an actor that is at par if not better than many ""stars"" of the industry. He portrays the antagonist, Bhavani- menacing, ruthless, focused yet calm and composed even at the most intense situations. Un antagonist perfectio.
Both the characters gets their own sweet screen time to establish their was, is, how, why and wheres, stories told in parellel, until they converge and meet.
Lokesh did an impeccable job in directing the film, keeping the interest of audience on the movie till the end.
Arjun Das, was a welcome addition from Kaithi crew.
Anirudh's songs may/may not be good, but his background scores did pushup the impact of certain films. He deserves an applause.
DOP is good. Stunt Silva did choreograph action scenes well, and with Lokesh's control, it was believable than previous films.
The film is not devoid of superstardom, but it is in a controlled form.
Vijay fans can be happy.
Sethupathi fans can rejoice.
Lokesh fans maybe a bit disappointed.
A film lover has a treat that entertains for 3 long hours. Not to miss from big screen.",Master
27,marvelshazamgadot,Worst movie of the decade,1,13 January 2021,Utter nonsense right from the start. Same old story. Makkal Selvan should not have accepted this role. First one hour is just nonsense,Master
28,maruthuk-21470,"Good movie, but too much violence.",7,31 January 2021,"Storyline of the movie and screenplay was good, but movie was little too long. Scenes with respect to drinking could have been avoided and violence was too high, screenplay for the second half was easily predictable and many scenes looked cinematic. Scenes when trying to explain his flashback were interesting and hilarious. Although there were too many characters, only 3 looked prominent, which were Vijay, Vijay Sethupathi & Arjun Das, in particular Vijay Sethupathi with his excellent dialogue delivery and mannerisms. When Vijay has many family fans, it could have been the one, which could be watched by the kids, which is not the case currently!",Master

He is lived as bhavani what an actor he is. Master JD Thalapathy vijay's career best performance for sure. We are all witnessed a never seen before Vijay in this movie. That swag mannerisms were outstanding to watch. Another big plus of this movie is anirudh's music. Anirudh killed it with his bg scores. Mahendran as kutty bhavani also steal the show with his acting. 2nd half is little long but don't take the negative reviews please do watch it as soon as possible. Don't miss this movie, highly recommended!",Master
30,sudheeshthulaseedharan,The battle between Dalapati and Makkal Selvan,6,13 April 2021,"The first film Dalapati Vijay and Makkal Selvan Vijay Sethupathi together, and it is directed by Lokesh Kanakaraj.The story is set in Nagercoil in 2002. The movie started with how 17-year-old Bhavani became a Mafia Monster at the height of his helplessness and despair.Then comes the movie Chennai in 2019. Vijay becomes JD's typical intro scene.JD is a professor at a college in Chennai. Despite being in the eyes of students, it is an eye-opener for college management and colleagues. Because of his depraved drinking habits and systemic actions.Point's deals are what make him look like a student at first glance.At a certain turning point in his life, Bhavani becomes an obstacle to Bhavani's activities and Bhavani becomes an obstacle to the activities of the JD.Both are intertwined. The film progresses in the context of a remedial school.Ultimately, the movie is about the battle between good and evil.The action scenes in Stunt Silva's choreography have been given good prominence.Throughout the film, there are mass scenes that will satisfy the fans of Vijay and Vijay Sethupathi. The highlight of the film is the dazzling presence and performance of Vijay and Vijay Sethupathi.While Vijay is able to keep his stardom one hundred percent with heroism, Sethupathi gets his hands dirty by making a brutal villain completely cool with his own informalities.",Master
31,msundari,Vj sethupathi mass,4,1 February 2021,Lokesh kanagaraj kaithi given more hope for Master and destroyed it completely. Vijay acting is always same over acting. Only person who acted well is vj sethupathi who is the pillar of the movie. Vijay character is such a worst in the movie who is always drinking and sleeping and not showing the reason for it.

52,sanjithkumar1995,The promised 50-50 movie from Lokesh,8,30 January 2021,"Being a huge fan of Director Lokesh and a Vijay fan in the past the announcement of this movie created tremendous hype which built up for a whole year. Contrary to the previous films of the director this is a pure commercial movie.
Vijay has improved a lot in script selection over the past decade and this movie would be a landmark in his career. Elevates every scene with his body language and hits hard in emotional scenes.
VjS lives as Bavani. He has a longer than usual screen-time a villain usually gets in such movies which helped build up the tension throughout the movie.
most of the side characters are limited to a couple of scenes despite the long runtime of the movie.
There could be no words to explain the wonders Anirudh did here. Cinematography is awesome. This is definitely not the best of Lokesh and expecting him to come back stronger with Vikram-movie but he definitely kept his promise and showed a different Thalapathy which is a rare feat.",Master

Both Vijay's and Sethupathi's characters were tremendous and were the main reason for us to hold on till the climax. Anirudh's bgm elevated the scenes to a whole new level.

Characters have making multiple Nagerkovil to Chennai trips in a 2 hour movieOne thing I liked is the famous tamil movie character are placed, no not the cringe worthy one vijay repeats throughout the movie. The characters like Thulukkanam the jailor from Mahanadhi movie by Shankar, Nammavar movie Selvam kamal reference by Naseer..Archer Andriah was told ""you drive the car"" by hero after couple of shots showing her skills. It could have been better if the director asked vijay to do both driving and archery. Can't even spare 10 minutes to other characters? Thankfully this is not another Petta for Sethupathy.

Great Entertainer!,7,19 January 2021,This movie starts off strong with an entirely new and fresh on screen vijay that audience havent seen before. vijay sethupathi is a strong villain and has a lot of screen time which is great. the ending is rushed and begins to follow the usual vijay template with messages and speeches but overall the movie is great and is the right direction for vijay. Vijay needs to continue making story based films and not relying on forced sentiment and speeches like atlee movies. lokesh kanagaraj did what he could and made a good movie for vijay fans and it will only continue to improve from here. Watch this movie for sure in theaters if you can.,Master

This movie presents the misuse of Juvenile boys and other contemporary aspects very well.
Thalapathy Mass performance, Sethupathi Class acting and It's a Lokesh's Masterpiece.
Andrea's climax segment is great.One small glitch I feel in the movie is that there are few scenes or sequences which seems to be either, other director has poked his nose in direction or Lokesh himself has tried few things which didn't workout.
Otherwise Overall the Movie is Great 👌🏻🎉🎊",Master
75,lakshmishaks88,Disappointed with Thalapathy,2,14 January 2021,"Master (2021) is a disappointment when compared to the rest of Thalapathy's movies. My main issue with the film is that Vijay's character John Durairaj (JD) is not the typical Thalapity character that we have come to be loved and admired. The character seems bit stepped back and not interested in the plot of the movie. We have brooding character which seems to lack seriousness and is interested in only giving moral lessons to audience. This movie would have been a better fit for Madhavan or Kamal Hassan of the old.What we want from Thalapathy movies is pure 100% Masala where the protagonist beats the hell out of Badies. The reason why Tamil and to a larger extent South Indian movies click with the audiences is that we want to see our Heros being invincible and the ability to smash through problems providing a contrast to our everyday lives. We dont want our Heros to be brooding, moral equivalents of ourselves. We can't bear to see this.Tell me would you watch if instead of Irfan Khan, Salman Khan was to be the protagonist of the movie ""Tiffin Box"". Would that make compelling watch?Hence my request to directors and film makes like Lokesh Kanagraj is to keep our Thalapathy the way he is supposed to be. Invincible uni-dimensional characters that can punch they way out of anything. We want Masala and only Masala and nothing else.",Master

77,smartcritic-97954,He is maturing as an actor. Well done,10,9 November 2021,"Its a well known fact that Vijay is a well known entertainer but the surprising thing is he is also maturing well as a performer and actor. Good to see his choice of movies. Vijay haters think and criticize that an actor should change his hair style which isn't the formula. An actor should gel with the role and he should make you feel a hands on and make the audience travel along with the film which he is doing it right now. Lorry fight sequence was unnecessary i think but its Lokesh's trademark touch i guess. I don't find any other negatives in the movie. It's well made.****NOTE****
one suggestion to the directors, please make Vijay fit in the role and speak punch dialogues only if the movie demands and where necessary. Its fine. You should first change your thought that fans always want a punch dialogue and a commercial element. Times have changed. So please do not make any changes to the story keeping Vijay in mind.",Master

The lorry fight scene Is the only unwanted scene in the entire movie.Watch this movie only for new Vijay (Only in first half) and the great negative character Bhavni(Vijay Sethupathi).You will definitely enjoy the first half.",Master
80,joshuarenealvarez,Master (2021),8,11 February 2021,"Master is an Indian Tamil-language film co-written
and directed by Lokesh Kanagarj, whom is best
known for his films such as Kaithi and Maanagaram.The plot revolves around a professor named John ""JD"" Durairaj (Vijay) who receives adoration and support from his students due to being an advocate for positive college reforms. His acclaim is ultimately overshadowed by his addiction to alcoholism which we witness him wrestle with throughout the film. I personally feel that if the reasons why he became an alcoholic would have been more explored, it would have resonated well with the audience and made for a very impactful character arc. JD is forced to take a three-month teaching job at a juvenile center where a nefarious gangster, Bhavari (Sethupathi) holds a tremendous amount of influence over the children. They are two sides of the same coin. It was a treat to watch these two clash in a power struggle as the actors who portrayed them handled their roles competently. I only would have preferred that they had more screen-time together. But the main issue that I have with this film is the pacing which is literally breakneck due to the editing. Scenes end abruptly and transition towards the next without allowing the audience to completely register what has happened. This made it difficult to follow at times and it's the reason why I was unable to become as emotionally invested in the film during pivotal moments, which was a shame because the writing was superb. If the pacing would have allowed us to marinate with the characters and the story then I'm sure that I would given this film a near-perfect score because it manages to check out all the other boxes with it's visually pleasing cinematography, over-the-top action sequences, wonderful musical score and dance choreography which motivates you to want to rise from your seat and join the cast members.This was my first Tamil-language film
and it was an unforgettable experience.Follow me on Instagram: @joshuarenealvarez

Like what the.. i know that he didnt lift the call and they got caught but isnt he like that before too , it would have better if he would have realized himself instead of her blaming him and movie has no twist and thrill whatsoever , was expecting so much since it's Lokesh and such a talented director got chance to do a big film and thought it would be a change but yet it was same old movie.Its a onetime watch at the end , and with corona i would recommend you to watch it on prime when it comes.",Master

88,mohammedihlas466,A Brilliant Cat & Mouse Action Entertainer 🔥!,10,13 January 2021,"Master - A Brilliant Example of a Perfect Cat & Mouse Action-Thriller! Director Lokesh gave us a promise that 'Master' will break the clichés that a 'Typical Thalapathy Movie' usually has & he kept his promise!Master is a clash between A Protagonist & An Antagonist, but it isn't your usual clash that you see in many other Tamil Movies. Here, the story is different. Lokesh has written the Character of the Antagonist 'Bhavani' with the same amount of Brilliance & Power that the Protagonist 'JD' has!Vijay Sethupathi has nailed his role as the Devilish Antagonist & whenever he appears on the screen, it's a blast! All the mannerisms, dialogue delivery & emotions he delivered through his character was spot-on!Last but not least, our very own 'Thalapathy' has once again proven his prowess as an Excellent Actor! The Fanboy inside me rejoiced when he broke his clichés. The dialogues, the fights, the expressions & the character of 'JD' in itself was unique & broke all the stereotypes! I adored every moment he lived as 'John Durairaj' on the screen!The technical crew of 'Master' deserves a standing ovation for the extraordinary work they've done! The Background Score of Master was one of the best compositions of Anirudh in his career! He was the second Protagonist in the movie! Sathyan Sooriyan's visuals were another Highlight! The cinematography was Top-notch & Unique!Special Praises to Stunt Master 'Silva' for giving us Classy & Realistic Action Sequences! The Action Scenes & stunts in Master were as Amazing as Thuppakki & that's a Big Statement!Overall, Master is a 50% Lokesh Film & 50% Thalapathy Vijay's Film! I don't think 'anyone' would hate this movie! It's the best blend of MASS & CLASS in a Movie!",Master
89,pugazholi,First half was good,6,16 January 2021,Second half is not flowing well. More than Vijay movie it's a sethupathi movie. Lokesh is not vetrimaran to give continuous good movie!,Master

The movie does have a fair share of flaws, but it is important to notice the promising direction that Vijay's character is seeming to head in. Looking forward to another Vijay-Lokesh combo.",Master

Because, for Thalapathy i can give 10/10. They could use another voice artist for thalapathy's voice.
Because, i watch movies in tamil and i am fan of thalapathy's voice. They could use voice artist who did work in theri. I think they will not forget next time.
Except this thing, i loved movie. Action scenes, Thalapathy's attitude, his new look, his style and mostly storyline. A True massage for society and govn. Thanks lokesh sir for this new year treat.",Master

102,prateekporwal305,Master the blaster,8,4 February 2021,"Coming from Lokesh K, this movie surely had high exceptations. With an Epic stardom of vijay and vijay S this should have been a blast, which it is upto a certain point. Second half is okish.Female leads are average too with Andreai being wasted for a cameo.
Highlight of movie is surely the guys: vijay,vijay s and arjun das
Music is great
One time watch",Master
103,susimaa,Not usual Lokesh movie !,5,15 January 2021,Only vijay fans can watch...Not regular lokesh movies... story and screen plan missing !,Master
104,arnabcal,Horrible movie,1,19 May 2021,"In one word it's the worst movie. No story only violence. Someone has money, actors has time, need to make a movie so they made it. Pathetic fighting sequences.",Master
105,elloydredding,Better than Vijay's other films but not as good as Lokesh's other films.,7,22 February 2021,Its better than many other recent Vijay films for sure but people expected it to be better than thuppaki and it surely wasn't. The actors did a good job especially Vijay Sethupathi who set the screen on fire.,Master
106,sebs-15532,Good action movie!,8,26 February 2021,"The villain is properly introduced with an interesting background story. But Thalapathys role is annoying and the movie is forcing with a very shocking incident an unimportant useless sad part. Which many of his movies have (Jilla, Mersal, Sarkar).But the action and fight scenes are superb but not as great as Kaithi.",Master
107,ashnasmam,The best version of Vijay and probably the worst of Lokesh,7,15 January 2021,(thala fan) this movie made me love Vijay sir. The best version of Vijay and probably the worst of Lokesh. Cringeless stylish pakka commercial film. First half is just fire second half little drag coz of the Length of a movie. Could have avoided some songs. Vjs the best villain ull see in a long time. Overall must watch cringeless best Vijay film up to date with very strong villain. Not the pure Lokesh kind still holds up.Ps: hope Vijay continues these kind of films instead of cringefest like bigil Sarkar mersal,Master
108,geddamsid,Massy with few gud moments,7,18 January 2021,"Positives: main leads , plot , songs n bgm , direction

111,krazzy_aldfo,A Trash with nothing to offer,1,13 January 2021,"Excitement all around as I entered the hall during these Covid times, hoping and only hoping this isn't a reversal to all the care and attention I have taken on so far to prevent infection.
Enter Vijay ! Whistles and howls all around by fans excited to see this man on a big screen after so long. 40 minutes or so of gripping scenes and then bam !! Waste the rest of your time watching uneventful fights and unwanted scenes of no relation to a story line that doesn't exist in the first place. Risk it ?? Nah ! Not worth the suffering !!
I'll be ignoring the massive vijay fans who want nothing but this great man's face on a big screen just for one reason, it's stupid to capitalise on a fan base by making garbage movies.
This is not a treat for anyone ! If I hurt any fans here, kindly learn to deal with it !!",Master
112,pradeepmangalore,Ok ok,6,30 January 2021,I'm giving 6 rating only for Vijay sethupathi the villian.,Master

116,southindianhindimovie-22833,Mind blowing,10,14 May 2021,Story is a something different but somewhat hyped as well and made in commercial way to appeal the fans. But should not miss it in theatres. I found it better than Vijay's previous movies like Bigil and Sarkar. You can find a Lokesh touch in the film may be not like Maanagaram or Kaithi but Still worth watching the movie for his story and direction and the performances of Vijay and VJS.,Master
117,sakthixlnz-73023,BLOCKBUSTER,9,13 January 2021,"Vijay And Vijay sethupathy have Nailed their roles ,With an Powerful screen play Lokesh han done an brilliant job and

And the screen play is really good. The 2hr 58min is like went we can't feel any spot as bored each and every scene makes us involve into the movie.",Master
119,rkvelayutham,Master The Blaster,10,13 June 2021,"I really liked this combo. This combo should join the film again. The film's director Lokesh Kanagaraj, composer Anirudh and actor Thalapathy Vijay have given the film a special touch. All the movies of Lokesh Kanagaraj will be great. The master is also included in Lokesh Kanagaraj's wonderful film. Lokesh Kanagaraj has to direct a lot of films. Anirudh would be great if he composed music normally. Anirudh composed the songs frantically in this film. I like all the songs and bgm in this film. But, I really like the Vaathi Coming song and Master The Blaster song. Thalapathy Vijay had a different performance in this film. Thalapathy Vijay's acting was superb. Thalapathy Vijay chooses to act in films with a lot of ideas. There is a good idea in this film too.",Master
120,danishali-31236,Vijay and vijay,10,15 July 2021,Awesome awesome awesome.mind blowing movie action drama simple message very good writter and director lokesh kanagraz.,Master
121,P-Rajayogan,"This is neither Vijay nor Lokesh film, it's a Vijay sethupathi film",2,14 January 2021,"I would have given it 6 stars if it was just a Vijay film, but with Lokesh expectations were sky high and it totally disappointed everyone. Only vijay fans might like it,for all others its a torture. First half you can tolerate but second dead slow.",Master
122,venkatesh-m89,Awesome again by Lokesh.,10,29 January 2021,"We could see Vijay in slightly different mannerism, There is no much dramatic stunts as compared to earlier vijay movie, lokesh has done the mass dialogues and stunts in less dramatic way, which the most +Ve point of this movie, The Gestures played by vijay in many scenes and fight reminds the extraordinary movie 'KATHI' , Vijay Sethupathi characterization is awesome. The conversation and sarcastic songs singing by vijay and vijay sethupathi is great. Lokesh has provided brilliant/Commercial script for vijay. After Thupaki and Kathi, This is another class movie for Vijay, and also Viay Sethupathi. The finger Knuckle braking by vijay Sethupathi, and color pull by vijay made a new style :) It popular now.",Master
123,kalyanapukaushik,Not as expected as the combination was huge.,5,13 January 2021,"The story was not much and it was dragged for 3 hours. Unnecessary and illogical expressions by Vijay and not so intimidating scenes are involved.However only Vijay Sethupathy's character's presence felt good even with his par acting as a usual villain.The best thing of the whole movie is only the music and the bgm.Not all characters have importance and hero doesn't have any kind of flashback but tells some movie stories as flashback which gets irritating at some point.In the climax, hero approaches the villain with all the kids and particularly one kid in his arms. That particular scene, Vijay's acting was foolish and direction at that point seemed disgusting... There are some scenes like this in the movie which seemed unnecessarily added.Anyways, I am a fan of Lokesh so I sincerely wish him all the best for his upcoming projects and wish to see the best plots and making like Khaidhi...",Master
124,hit-singh,Waste of time post Intermission,5,7 March 2021,Movie was very good till intermission and post that seems movie lost it track and unnecessary stretched movie. Average movieVijay was average. It Bhavani character awesome.,Master

Both Vijay's excelled in their roles, Anirudh has given excellent songs and bgm as always!!!
Finally, don't expect a new story, enjoy the performances🙂🔥⚡",Master

JD vs BHAVANI",Master
130,visaalmurali,JD vs BHAVANI,10,20 May 2021,The next blockbuster movie for Lokesh kanagaraj career and my one of my favourite directors. For the first time vijay as JD acts as alcoholic and giving space for vijay sethupathi's BHAVANI character to score his role. He acts with his natural behaviour and attracts the audience so much. And Lokesh team guys such as editor philomin Raj and cinematographer Sathyam sorryan and music director Anirudh are pillars of the movie.,Master
131,sharonmass007,Master,10,13 January 2021,Must watch film. Top notch performance from Vijay and Vijay sethupathi. Highly recommended for the fans.,Master
132,nikhilforever,"Same day, same price",5,30 January 2021,"What more to expect from Vijay movies? He will be the
1. Superhero
2. Lazy
3. Seeking personality
4. No negatives
5. Somebody supports him
6. Sad story
7. Alcoholic
8. Always right about his decisions
9. Gets severe criticism, emotions, revenge, ultimate win.The stupid fan base of Vijay, the hype they create.. rather this shall be a Sethupathi movie.Sethupathi showed Vijay exactly how it should be done.1. Simple
2. Not exaggeration
The way Joseph Vijay portrayed those emotional sequence, shaking his glasses seeing the body, the police station scenes.Atleast half of these hype or appreciation had gone to Suriya or Dhanush or Vijay Sethupathi himself, Tamil film industry would have been the number 1. No doubt.",Master

2nd half is little bit lagging without no story move.Except that VJ mannerism makes u crazy also VJS Terrorism ll haunt u.Worth Watching not like other Thalapathy Movies.
Vijay just given up his image & allowed everyone to mock him Its a sign of selfless actor.Climax & interval block was terrific.Dont listen to negative reviews.Its a pure commercial entertainment & decent watchable",Master
135,arunaroy-82147,MASTER (UA) An entertaining film. THALAPATHY ROCKS!!,10,15 January 2021,"Positives:=Performance of Thalapathy Vijay, his style,swag, attitude, dialogue delivery. He is even great at emotional scenes.=Vijay Sethupathi nailed it. He did a good job as the villain.=Anirudh Ravichander Music, I love the songs Vasthi Raid, Kitty Story and Quit Pannuda, other songs are also superb.=Good social message.=Well choreographed fight scenes.=Cinematography.Negatives:=Some scenes are too lengthy. Would have cut 20-25 minutes.=Editing could have been better.= Arjun Dass and Vijay Sethupathi should have got more screen space.Overall entertaining. Waiting for VIKRAM.",Master

138,karthiksrikanth,Inconsistent and has many plot holes,4,3 August 2021,"The plot is not satisfying at many places and the motives of characters in many scenes are underwhelming and at places don't make sense. This is due to the poor screenplay and under developed characters. Many characters shown in the film need not be added. They did not make any significant improvement to the storyline. Inconsistency is the biggest villain of the film and fails it big time
A different opinion- the acting was just okay from all the actors. Some of them failed to deliver a good performance (includes the lead)it all boils down to the screenplay at the end, and it fails to deliver.",Master

144,ananthwallace,Vijay has experimented a bit and boy oh boy it has work!!ed,9,13 January 2021,"First of all it was refreshing to see vijay try something different. The movie has mass eliments , emotions and little bit of over the top action. But there's a Very unique element to it all even Vijay looks a totally different person embodying the character. I didn't like any of the Atlee movies. Sure they were entertaining in patches but were not great at all.master on the other hand might not be celebrated as those movies but in time fans will appreciate it. The harsh realities it showcases about the lives of under age people in the crime, how they are exploited, the things and people who influence their lives are depicted well and are things to take note of . Overall it was a great watch many might not like it and it's not perfect but in time it'll get the recognition it deserves. And one more thing Vijay sethubathi was fantastic!!!",Master
145,laktej,VJS is good but as usual Vijay is worst,3,10 August 2021,1st half skip Vijay scenes watch only VJS scenes. Then watch 2nd half in 2x speed. No logic with any activities of Vijay. Watch it if you dont have anything to do. VJS as usual good acting but no fun/thrill in story line.,Master

Movie is too long and as usual in all vijay's movie he has to make fun of hinduism... its subliminal but thats what is happening in most of the tamil movies.... its like all christians ( Only off late conversions ) have taken upon themselves to do this",Master
147,sunnnydo,Good but could have been better,6,8 February 2021,More or less the same story type.. there is no change.. both the Vijay's were awesome...very little importance given to actresses ... movie wouldn't change in any way without the actresses (heroine)..,Master

1. Both the Vijays have done their roles perfectly.
2. Anirudh's songs and BGM in this movie was lit!!!

4. Arjun Das and other important characters did their roles perfectly.
5. There was a little bit comedy, which worked well.
6. Story and screenplay were goodNegatives:
1. Felt like the movie was a bit too lengthy.Overall, I would give this movie a 9.5/10 because of its length, but since 9.5 rounds about to 10, I would have to give it a 10. To the general audience, please do not miss this masterpiece, and ignore the negative and fake reviews.",Master

Lokesh unlike his previous films didn't do a great job. He disappointed me.
Screenplay was poor and there were unnecessary illogical scenes. And if you didn't like the first half of the film then you'll die in the second.
At last, Master is a film that'll bring the old theatre experience back but it's just one time watch. My Rating- 3.5/5

184,naveenvishnu,An Unique Vijay Vs Terrific VJS,10,15 June 2021,"After Kaithi I will say that Master is one of the technically strong movie in tamil cinema. Even in direction, songs, bgm, acting, characterisation, cinematography, 1st half screenplay, less importance of heroine role ,casual script ,These are the the positive aspects that i can feel. But i also feel some negatives The 2nd half is somewhat long and not moving to the next level in the story , the depth of writing and dialogues in the 1st half is lesser in 2nd half. Whatever...for cinema lovers Master is a visual treat to see. Don't except this movie as a usual vijay movie with mass and commercial aspects..There are more hidden details in the movie..But I want to say that acting and characterization of VJS overtakes Vijay in most of the scenes...This is one of the best positive aspect. Commonly in a movie.. Villain role should be more powerful than hero role..And so there will be a curiosity for us to search what will be next..Lokesh understood this concept and applied successfully.",Master

187,showry,Fools say Master is flop!,8,15 January 2021,I am a Telugu reviewer!! Master is good in many things and not good in its length....cut short to 2 and half hours its worth a watch more than once guys!! Lenght is the problem!!,Master
188,agngoutham,Draggy- Something Missing & not connecting well with audience.,4,2 February 2021,"Movie should be either cinematic or pure commercial entertainer. Lokesh failed to choose one and MASTER is neither a good commercial movie nor a cinematic drama.This movie is for 3 hours length with many illogical and unnecessary scenes. Why students celebrating professor JD , what he did to them they never told. Movies like NAMMAVAR & RAMANA beautifully showed why students admiring their Professor very much. But in MASTER , they simply overhyped without any logic. Ministers waiting in college function was stopped by students who protesting to allow drunkard professor looks comic. They placed so many mass scenes forcefully.Lokesh showed he is a master of screenplay with briliantly directed Maanagaram and Kaithi . Both films never bored at all.
But in Master you will feel the length , lag in screenplay and after watching for 3 hours , it will not give any impact . Don't beleive fans review. As a neutral fan , you will dislike it.This movie had ensemble cast and stars , but only both Vijay's got screen space . By watching this you can feel for wasting 3 hours . As a movie it doens't have any splendid performance or story or screenplay. Story and Screenplay hasn't connected anything even after 180 mins time . They just merged scenes here and there .
Wish they could have done it as mass masala entertainer atleast.MASTER - Draggy & Testing ..",Master
189,Affshar,Why Lokesh .. what happened to you..?,5,13 January 2021,"Average flick... !!As a neutral fan, u will feel that film was average and predictable story and it's a full on VJS mass show, compared to Vijay's mass presence..
nothing new was implemented.. 3 hours lengthier movie, need patience..
Movie completely focused on Vijay and Vjs fans expectations.
First half went good.. In second half so many places felt lagging..
Lokesh has designed the story for Vijay and VJS, so he has compromised his actual script it seems..Overall.. if u like commercial movies and love to watch mass scenes, this movie will satisfy.. if u are expecting a masterclass films like Kaithi and Maanagaram, this Master is not for you.",Master

192,ananddhruv-14378,Master,10,29 January 2021,"What I see in this movie is that there are 4 people, amongst whom, even if one of them wasn't present in the movie, it wouldn't have been a masterpiece. The 4 people are: ThalapaTHEE, THE Makkal Selvan, That Musical Beast, and that one of a kind director. If either of them weren't there in the movie, it would have flopped. It is one of a kind and one of THE best movies I've seen!!",Master
193,globalcitizen-46192,It's a drag,1,5 February 2021,"VJS performance is excellent as usual
But VJ looks funny trying hard to act.
Second half is complete drag without any story
Using Bow & Arrows to destroy a dozen trucks is laughable.
It's become a fashion to mock Hindu Gods and characters.. like Bhavani (VJS) is an antisocial in this movie. but a Christian John D (VJ) is the hero!! Infact JD directly mocks the names Bhavani & Bhanumati.
This needs to stop if you really care for your fans",Master

From there till climax it's really worth. Vijay sethupathi scores very easily especially when he challenges while taking bath... With horns... Wow. It is not stereotyped Vijay movie. It is different... It is also not the Lok,Kan.. movie too coz it has many logic flaws... Overall a movie worth watch for VJ n VJS. Special mention to the small boy in second half who is the hero of the juvenile portion. Go for it.",Master

His acting was really natural i wish vijay could have done something in same way instead of dummy fight scene and trying to show off. Overall movie was ok not as good as hype was created. After 2 great hit from director had huge expectations from him but he failed to deliver. He needs to bounce back and recover asap. Do not forget why people liked you do not let anything stop you from making movies like the way you want it to be.,Master

208,akshayrpillai-21845,Not a complete Lokesh film,9,13 May 2021,It's a 50-50 Lokesh & Vijay film. If you are expecting something like Maanagaram or Kaithi this may disappoint you. Otherwise its a perfect movie. Vijay & Vijay Sethupathi are the shiw steelers of this movie. Anirudh once again rocked with his terrific songs.The main reason why I gave 10/10 stars for this is because a Super Star like Vijay became ready to do such kind of movie where Villain ( Vijay Sethupathi) have lot of scope. Definitely Vijay Sethupathi is a greatest actor I have no doubt in it.,Master
209,sha-98576,SuparHit,9,3 February 2021,Story is a something different but somewhat hyped as well and made in commercial way to appeal the fans. But should not miss it in theatres. I found it better than Vijay's previous movies like Bigil and Sarkar. You can find a Lokesh touch in the film may be not like Maanagaram or Kaithi but Still worth watching the movie for his story and direction and the performances of Vijay and VJS.,Master

219,ssr-70578,"Is Master the ""Lokesh Kanagaraj"" movie that we all waited for?",8,18 January 2021,"One of the most awaited and anticipated movie of the past two years, Master hits the screen with its lead roles played by the protagonist 'Thalapathy Vijay' , and antagonist ' Makkal Selvan Vijay Sethupathi'. Although, this film is the clash between two Vijay 's , there are a lot of characters who acted their roles very well. Plot-wise, the First-half plays an important part in establishing all the characters and maintains the pace while keeping the audience entertained with Jhon Dhurairaj's (Vijay)quirky and funny character and Vijay's overall outstanding screen-presence. The second half speeds up while sticking to the plot while keeping all the humour bundled within the story. The elevation for the interval was a very good addition to the film.Anirudh is a gift to the industry. His background score elevates the scenes by giving the audience twice the amount of impact for each scene. Most of the songs in this film are used in the background. Speaking of which, the songs seems to lack better placement. This does induce a little lag to the film.Now, to the main question, Is this a Lokesh Kanagaraj film?.... Yes, but partially!
Even though the film has a lot of easter eggs and subtle dark humour, hints that foreshadow the upcoming events in the film, and anti-cliche elements which the director has successfully implemented... This movie seems to lack at logic at some places. Scenes have abrupt ending and audience aren't given enough time to take in the emotion in the second half,for which both the previous films of Lokesh Kanagaraj didn't have any issue.In conclusion, this movie is a very good entertainer with a lot of fun elements(direct references as well) to wait for and a good script, with a new dimension to Vijay. Vaathi has single handedly revived the pongal excitement!",Master

259,thesrilankanlad,A tale of 2 Halves,7,14 January 2021,"Before diving into this review, I want to congratulate the whole Master crew for pulling this off during this COVID period . Your patience has paid off in this thrilling movie.VIJAY: During this movie , I felt that I saw a different type of Vijay, someone who doesn't show the obvious massiness in him. I applaud his selfless attitude in giving other stars more screen time and blending in with their strengths. Contrary to other Vijay film , here , he plays an alcoholic professor who is the favourite among students and does what he could given his drunken and laid back character. I saw a more relaxed acting in him . He doesn't necessarily seem to act in a massy way but lets it naturally flow out of him . Also, his introduction was 15 mins in , which made it have a Lokesh touch in it . I personally liked how comfortable he got with this character by really trying to exude what he is about . Even though we know he is JD , I felt that a flashback could have helped develop his character as we don't get a lot of insight into who JD really is and how he got there . One major negative in this film is actually the runtime of 3 hours . I felt that if some scenes were made more crisp , there could definitely have been a flashback . But you do come to realise that maybe these little flaws occurred because Vijay sat back and allowed Lokesh to do what was needed. Also, I felt that the emotional scenes could've been more crisper but I loved the way Vijay went about being emotional himself. For me , I felt Vijay's presence more in the first half. But overall, a clean and unique performance by Vijay.VJS- Given the mass appeal of Vijay , I feel that VJS wanted to go that extra mile because he knew that character-wise , he had to be as bad of a villain and Vijay is as good as a hero . VJS' presence was felt throughout the movie and his character was more developed . Out of many Tamil movies I've watched and being a movie lover myself, VJS' character was probably the darkest character I've seen and he acted really well to it . His mannerisms and his tone made it that much more sinister and I feel that VJS was much better than Vijay in a character sense. One particular thing that I found interesting and loved about Lokesh's thinking was the element of religion . We see him wearing chains and praying to God but as a dark villain , it was ironic to see him looking up at God before giving his victims time to decide before death . The acting was superb and even when Vijay clashed into him , he kept to the villain tone .Malavika - This is my first time seeing Malavika on screen and frankly even though she played her role well, she didn't get the screen time to express herself and her character was also slightly undeveloped . In a typical mass movie , you would expect the hero to be present throughout the film and thus giving the heroine the role of tagging along and being in love which has been evolving with the likes of Nayanthara in Bigil. But here , there weren't many love scenes and so it took away that feeling of her being there .BGM : Anirudh is known for hitting the spot when it comes to a mass, slick Vijay film and he has done exactly that. In every scene , Anirudh brought his best in terms of BGM and special praise goes to bringing back that nostalgic Kabbadi theme from Ghilli, giving it that Vijay spice. The songs were placed seamlessly into the story and it felt like it was part of the script. He can match the music to the mood and he knows how to make it appeal to the younger audience .OVERALL: A UNIQUE VIJAY FILM WITH SUPERB ACTING FROM VJS BUT WAS A TALE OF 2 HALVES WHERE THE FIRST HALF WAS VIJAY AND SECOND HALF WAS VJS . ONE MINUS IS THE RUNTIME WHICH , IF MADE MORE SHORTER AND CRISPER , COULD HAVE ALLOWED MORE CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT .",Master

It's so much entertaining and Mass.
Anirudh BGM is the best and I feel it's Anirudh's best music for this film
JD & BHAVANI, both of the were the beast
Never seen Character of Thalapathy Vijay
Mass Vilanism by Vijay Sethupati
Both Equally mass
It was great to see a Angry and rage full Thalapathy Vijay on screen and a cool villain Vijay Sethupati. Their Character arc is the biggest plus for this movie. This movie is all about that Climax clash between JD & Bhavani.
Both their Characters was Magnificent",Master
287,slsniranjanan,Best Commercial movie in Indian Cinema,10,13 January 2021,"VIJAY AND VIJAY SETHUPATHI CHARACTER ARC was the story of this film.

Kudos to Big Star like VIJAY to accept on having another Upcoming Hero together in this film. Vijay's generosity towards Vijay Sethupati made him shine as Bhavani. Best Face off in Indian Cinema. Mark my words, this Hero Villain combo will be the best of Tamil cinema, and can't be replaced for years",Master
288,marofmehedi,A terrific entertainer from THE VIJAY DUO!,8,29 January 2021,"Action packed mass-entertainer is what we should call 'Master' as. But it's not just all-out action without any sense. There is a really good storyline that the movie carries throughout.I found a very strong well defined villain in Vijay Sethupathi. In some moment, I started to love the villan a lot more than the hero. That's how Vijay Sethupathi portrayed his role as always. On the other end, Vijay has acted an absolute class with a whole new shade of personality. In my opinion, this is the movie after Kaththi where Thalapathy has shown that he can act as a character rather than being the conventional 'do-good-save-people action hero'. I must say the songs & background music from Anirudh has been excellent.Everything were quite positive, though there were certain scene that looks unnecessary, added only for entertaining the audiences and lengthening the movie. Overall, it has been a terrific entertainer for me from THE VIJAY DUO being a bigtime fan of both.#Master2021 #VijayTheMaster #VijaySethupathi",Master

295,ganenthirantheivendran,Master Review,10,27 January 2021,"This is completely a new genre of film: mass drama. It is a mass film with an essence of drama. Thalapathy Vijay and Makkal Selvan Vijay Sethupathi have nailed their roles to perfection. Watch out for Vijay's intro, the interval block, the ostrich story, the scene where JD threatens Bhavani and at last, the climax. After a long time, there is a really memorable climax in a Thalapathy film. The characters of JD and Bhavani will remain iconic in Tamil Cinema. I know that this is not a 100% Lokesh film, but Lokesh himself told that this is going to be a 50% Lokesh-50%Vijay film. And I have to say he succeeded in that aspect. And Anirudh. His BGM was the backbone of the film. The songs were damn good as well. Everyone in the supporting cast, especially Master Mahendra and Poovaiyar, have acted really well There. There are rumors that thalapathy 66 will be a Vijay-Lokesh-Anirudh combo. Hopefully that happens as well.",Master

Overrated and boastful with no meaningful storyline.,2,15 May 2021,"This seems to be an overrated cliche action movie where the actor attempts to once again glorify themselves or their message and completely neglect a decent plot. The only scenes in the movie that are actually good would be the Bhavani's introduction and abusive struggle and the sequence of archery combat, but they're drowned out by a lengthy cliche cinematic. Bhavani also has a signature one punch fist attack wheres JD is seen fighting with a bangel which is quite stupid and makes no sense. Overall there is almost no emotional nor character development, points that are clarified in words instead of action, and comedic soundtrack for serious scenes. There seems to be no proper planning or effort to make an engaging storyline or form of sympathy for any of the characters. You'll go through the movie just wishing for three hours back.",Master

Vijay Sethupathi's Bhavani character problably one of the best villain characters of Kollywood. Vijay sethupathi scores on his every individual screen presence as a pure evil. Anirudh bgms and songs were the next supporting element to the Movie. Ani Rocked it.. The first half goes in a good flow and there's no lag and the intermission scene was power packed.

Vj and Vjs did a great job in this movie and thalapathy was full of swag. In the other end, vjs acting was marvellous and to be honest he overtaked thalapathy in the acting part (but not in dance..lol). Dont forget that rockstar anirudh has done a great job in this movie. Most of the songs was decent and the bgm was fantastic (the song placements wasn't that good in my point of view) but thalapathy's dance will make u forget that.

It's a commercial movie, yes, but the message delivered is good.
And this is coming from Thala's fan. Personally I liked the movie, but people have their own tastes and I would like to suggest y'all to see a movie as a movie alone and not as a competition for the actors.
And Lokesh can very well explore other genres, I don't understand why everyone's like ""this doesn't feel like lokesh's movie"". It was quite entertaining :)",Master

Watching the 2nd time, the 2nd half is really slow, but the Bahubali-like climax makes up for every extra minute in the 2nd half. Vijay himself has come out of his safe zone and VJS is a ruthless villain and next to Raghuvaran and Prakash Raj. Anirudh has added the songs so well that it flows with the movie.

386,angaline,Honest review on 1time view,8,20 January 2021,"This movie has both good and also bad aspects.
Good aspects:
The movie kept me engaging, though the core story is simple. There were places in the movie which didn't have cliches and hence the predictions of the views get wrong in a good way which brings in the surprises.Bad aspects:
Felt that there weren't enough space for the other character developments and felt like the development of the antagonist was more detailed more than the protagonist. (What i mention is not about the screen timing of the actors. Being a THALAPATHY fan i too enjoyed those fan moments but the depth of the character wasn't fully developed within the time limit).The location and timing
It was confusing and illogical when the story was jumping from Chennai to Nagercoil. Myself having my native as Devicode, Kanykumari who has been born and bought up in Chennai know how much it takes to travel from there to here frequently. Especially i felt it illogical in the 2nd half.Language and dialect
When people make movies with Madurai, coimbatore, Karaikudi, or any region as base, they use that region's dialect. But isn't there for Kanykumari? Najil Tamil wasn't there even for a bit except for the word ""makka"" and thirunelveli slang was used. Atleast would have used Malayalam and tamil words together. 😕😕😕😕😕.",Master

391,salesforcepractical,Vijay's Master Stroke!!,10,29 January 2021,This Movie is the must watchable even for an ordinary movie goer. Vijay looks so different and steals the show.

396,vishnuasari,My thoughts of master,10,20 March 2021,As a fan had fun watching the film there were flaws but that 50 percent lokesh's part was seriously good and it was success both jd and bhavani rocked. Thalapathy again proved all those puluthis (translate it if u don't know tamil) who say he cannot act. About music many people have described it more excitingly and in a solid way. Some people say other characters didn't have a proper role. I think if they wouldn't have announced the cast & showed us directly in the film we wouldn't have felt like that because of no expectations. I hope this is a new start for thalapathy in this decade as we can expect some solid films from him. Overall this movie was a great experience,Master

Lokesh Kanagaraj had created a plot which was no random and tried to tie it somehow.Vijay and Vijay Sethupathi have done their part to hold the movie somehow.The first 30minutes was unnecessary and had no relevance to the later part of the movie. It was like a pure political propoganda. Vijay Sethupathi character as a villian was built nice till the first half.The movie started only 20 mins before the interval. The director somehow managed to navigate with a unclear plot with loopholes.I still am not sure on the following1. Why was there a kabadi scene? what was the significance other than the reference to gilli?
2. Why was Vijay at Bhavanis place to threaten and then run away without doing anything?
3. How come Vijay reach the fleet of trucks that started couple of hours early? Why were the trucks giving space to Vijay to cross them and go rather than crushing the car? Why was bow and arrow used to stop trucks?
4. Why was Vijay Sethupathi trying to cross the border?I can go on and on.. I hope u get the point.. In short, the story was ...oh wait , there was no story to begin with.",Master

427,DhanuRated,Thalapathy's Great Experiment,8,3 February 2021,"Master, the spiritual sequel to the 1994 Kamal-starrer Nammavar is co-written and directed by Lokesh Kanagaraj and co-written by Rathna Kumar and Pon Parthiban. Following the success of ""Maanagaram"" and ""Kaithi"" Lokesh gained wide recognition for his work. He became a household name in the Tamil cinema industry and he quickly got opportunities to work with leading actors such as Thalapathy Vijay and Ulaga Nayagan Kamal Haasan. When it was announced that Lokesh will be working with Vijay everyone created a hype and the expectation level increased rapidly.Thalapathy Vijay is known for choosing over-the-top commercial films which follow the same template every other mass masala films do; songs and comedy scenes that seem to be distracting and take you out of the primary storyline, romance that has no value to the plot and unrealistic fight scenes. Master, however, is a different approach and it's truly refreshing to see Thalapathy Vijay in a different kind of role.I love it when actors go out of their comfort zones and experiment their acting abilities. We all are used to see Vijay in his macho and romantic roles, but I love it when Vijay stays in his characters. Examples are Vasanth in ""Priyamudan"", Kutty in ""Thulladha Manamum Thullum"", Gautham Prabhakar in ""Kannukkul Nilavu"", Jeevanandham in ""Kaththi"" and most recently ""Rayappan"" in Bigil. It is safe to say the character ""JD"" is another great new addition to this list. The characters Rayappan and Vettri Maaran have great arcs, and these characters alone are the best parts of Bigil and Mersal, but that doesn't make them flawless or great movies. The fact that Vijay had very few punch lines, no romantic scenes and realistic fight scenes (except the lorry chase scene) in Master was refreshing to watch. JD is vulnerable, tired, sleepy and weak, and that's why it is so refreshing to see Thalapathy Vijay in this role. The dynamic his character has makes JD hands down the best character Vijay has portrayed in a long time.Vijay Sethupathi on the other hand carried the film with his shoulder. His character was well established already in the beginning and VJS just knocked it out of the park. His charisma, funny lines and great character arc makes the character ""Bhavani"" a well written antagonist. It is also important to mention that Master Mahendran who portrayed the younger Bhavani deserves to be praised for his acting and for maintaining his and VJS's charisma and body language on the same level.Malavika Mohanan did her best, but I felt like her character and Andrea Jeremiah's character could have been put together as one character. They didn't have much to do in the film, but I felt like Malavika Mohanan had more to contribute to the story than Andrea Jeremiah had. Other characters that I think were phenomenal are ""Das"" and ""Undiyal"", both portrayed by Arjun Das and Poovaiyaar. Poovaiyaar was this comical relief that constantly gained claps from the audience. Arjun Das, on the other hand, was another character that had a dynamic impact in the story. I won't say what kind of dynamic impact his character has. You just have to watch the film to find out.The cinematography by Sathyan Sooryan was excellent, especially in the interval and climax fight scene, Vaathi Raid scene and the Vaathi Coming dance number. Anirudh Ravichandar's score and soundtrack were easily the film's backbone. Philomin Raj deserves also to be praised for his editing, especially in the cuts between Thalapathy and Makkal Selvan in the interval scene where thunder and rain play significant roles.My main issue with the film is its pacing. The college portions is the first half could have been cut out since the scenes and the characters who appeared in these portions didn't contribute much to the actual story. There is a pre-climax action scene that features lorries that I personally was not a fan of.Master is by no means a bad movie, but it's not a great film either, but it is absolutely an important film in Thalapathy Vijay's career because of the career choices Vijay made through this film; to go out of the regular commercial film template. Master carries a message about drug use and alcoholism that is relatively important to spread to children and teenagers of today's society. With this I hope Vijay will continue to work in films that don't contain the regular commercial film template. Thalapathy should continue his experiments.Highlights: Interval scene, combination scenes Thalapathy Vijay had with VJS, Arjun Das and Poovaiyaar, ""Vaathi Raid"" scene, ""Vaathi Coming"" dance number and climax fight scene.Lowlights: Lorry chase (pre-climax), college portionGrade: B - 8/10",Master

431,vigneshsathiavelu,MASTER - BEST COMMERCIAL ENTERTAINER FOR PONGAL,10,14 January 2021,"An unusual Vijay movie. VIJAY stands high with his mannerisms, characterisation, dance and with ground level realistic mass fight scenes. VIJAY SETHUPATHY scores with his attitude and powerful eyes. Conversation of VJS with his gang worked well. ANIRUTH marks his sign with Ghillli KABADDI remix, Vaathi Coming & Vaathi Raid. Also, BGM's elevated the scenes more. VJ and VJS FACEOFF scenes are the high points. Duration is quite lengthy. But, it's fine to enjoy a movie which we are all watching after so longtime. Definitely, after THUPPAKKI and KATHTHI, VIJAY gave a whole sum movie with VJS which is a sure shot Blockbuster. TREAT TO WATCH FOR PONGAL FESTIVAL.",Master

438,mrahul-75641,A well-executed action drama worth watching,9,30 January 2021,"This film is a wonderful watch for the B&C center audiences, with the main positives being the electrifying performances of Vijay and Sethupathi, the wonderful BGM, the perfect camera work and slick dance and stunt choreography. The fight scenes are more realistic than ever.While the story is a riveting and solid one, the writing may have gone a little too greasy leading to a pace issue. This does happen when you have more than one writer on board. The job, nevertheless, has been done well. I do not blame the editing either. No trimming can be done in the cuts unless the writing itself is properly curated. Hence, the editing was great.I did not observe any logical fallacies unlike in other commercial movies. Things are believable. Special mention to the lighting and colour. Absolutely eye-catching!Many A center audiences complained about the film not being a complete Lokesh Kanagaraj movie. I do not completely oppose them or side with them. I believe this is still a Lokesh Kanagaraj movie that contains more commercial elements, and hence cannot be compared to his previous ones. Kudos to him and the entire crew.The other characters have given their best in the limited time-frame given to them. I wouldn't complain about their screen time being overshadowed: the film has an ensemble cast, and of course, there are two powerful actors whom we just can't take our eyes off!To sum up, Master is a superbly made film. I am not going to crib about its relatively minor flaws. There are huge positives that I can be content with. Definitely worth the 3 hours, to be honest!",Master

Its fan feast for thalapathy and commercial fans . Sethupathy characterization is really took the film to another level . Both vijay and vjs nailed in acting. My rating will be 9.1/10,Master
455,ipsofficerak,V-V factor brought magic to this film✨,9,16 May 2021,"As promised Lokesh has delivered a grounded commercial venture. Both Vijay had done their job perfectly. Their presence gave a shine over the story. Apart from them,many characters came and gone,but failed to give a lasting impact. Some of those characters which did,were Young Bhavani,Two kids(who were plot of the movie),Undiyal and Arjun Dad. The 'Truck chase' scene could have been edited and made believable. Climax was not up to the expected level and was highly predictable. Overall the movie is indeed 'Enjoyable',hope Thalapathy will keep reducing commercial factor gradually with his upcoming films.",Master

464,pranaypillai,An Average commercial flick!,5,6 February 2021,"The most awaited film of 2020, Master, starring Joseph Vijay and Vijay Sethupathi has been theatrically released on 13th January 2021 worldwide. The film is directed by critically acclaimed director Lokesh Kanagraj who has given cinematic masterpieces like Managaram and Kaithi.Speaking about the storyline which is pretty weak and predictable, the film follows the life of an alcoholic professor who is sent to a juvenile home and thereon clashes with a ruthless gangster who uses the children of the Juvenile home for criminal activities. The script could have been more enhanced and crisper, like giving the heroine's character a little more significance.The overall cinematography was excellent, especially the pre-interval fight scene, which was shot very well with a good use of lights, and as well as the emotional scenes showing minimum gore. The music is composed by Anirudh Ravichander, marking his second collaboration with Vijay after Kaththi. The songs and the background score were terrific, making it probably one of the best background score of Anirudh's career after Petta and Kaththi. As usual, both the Vijays' performance were excellent. The fight scenes were realistic unlike a regular Vijay film which have unnecessary Mass elements. Sethupathi rocked the screens with his unbelievable performance as Bhavani, the main antagonist. Arjun Das deserves a special mention for his wonderful portrayal of Das, a supportive character. Malavika Mohanan could have done a better job as the heroine. The direction was satisfactory but not better than Lokesh's previous ventures probably because of the script's weakness. A big drawback of the film was its length; the film's total runtime is about 3 hours which is quite a long for a film's duration.Overall, this film is an average Lokesh Kanagraj film, an above average Vijay film which makes it worth to watch it one time. The film has collected more than INR 250 crores at the worldwide box office (the budget being INR 135 crores), becoming the highest grossing film of 2021. I would give this film a rating of 2.5/5.",Master

507,VijayIsMyLife,An out-and-out action-packed stylish entertainer,10,16 January 2021,"Master is an out-and-out stylish action entertainer powered by the robust performances from Thalapathy Vijay and Vijay Sethupathi. The fusion of Lokesh Kanagaraj's sublime classy filmmaking and Thalapathy's mass work superbly in Master. It's a unique and most grounded Thalapathy film in years.
Lokesh shows Vijay in a never-seen-before avatar as JD as he promised. Both looks-wise and performance-wise, Thalapathy Vijay fires on all cylinders. While underplaying, he still exudes an unbelievable aura in action scenes and pulls off emotional scenes with great conviction.
In Master, Thalapathy gives his most all-round performance in years. With the character mannerisms, antics, humor, dialogue delivery, emotions, fights, he is at the top of his game. The JD character will be remembered for Vijay's attitude and suaveness and how he is grounded and gives space to other actors to shine.
Lokesh has untapped Thalapathy's unexplored side to an extent.
Vijay Sethupathi is equally good and delivers one of his finest acting performances. I said before we lack an iconic villain since Siddharth Abhimanyu. Now Bhavani has fulfilled that vacuum. He is menacing and bloody ruthless. It's one of the best villain characters written in Tamil cinema. The duels between Thalapathy Vijay and Vijay Sethupathi live up to the hype.
Lokesh has handled the ensemble cast well - impressive Arjun Das and Poovaiyar stand out.
Shanthanu and Andrea Jeremiah make a mark. I would have loved to see more of Andrea Jeremiah. She's a brilliant actress. Directors should cast her as the female lead and make use of her potential. Malavika looked gorgeous on screen.
The music by Anirudh laps the movie up; he's delivered one of his best. Anirudh's background score intensifies the action scenes, which are well-choreographed and some of the best you will see in recent years. The English tracks are used well for JD. The
I liked how all songs are part of the story. When the album was out, some people were worried that these many songs would dent the pace. But this is not the case in Master. Also, the songs' placement is brilliant. The picturization of the already popular song, Vaathi Coming, is too good.
Lokesh made it clear in multiple interviews that we would see 50% Vijay film and 50% Lokesh film. Even though it's a Vijay film, there's Lokesh's stamp in it. He refreshingly packages a simple storyline loaded with riveting action scenes. That interval is a blast! The sheer intensity makes it one of the finest interval blocks for Vijay.
However, I would have loved tighter writing in the second half that could have helped us show more moments of brilliance from Lokesh. Master's best experience can only be felt by watching it on a big screen. The success of Master is important not just for the film industry's revival but also for Thalapathy Vijay to act in more unique and story-driven films where one of the brilliant actor's untapped potential will come out.",Master

515,bmtnmujc,Master,10,13 January 2021,Must watch movie. Acting has gone to next level. Vikay sethupathi has done a great job. Captain of the ship lokesh should be appreciated.,Master
516,akshayvinodav,A VIJAY MOVIE WITHOUT CLICHES.,6,13 January 2021,First time seeing a depth in villains character (which is not there in other commercial hero movies). Vijay sethupathi nailed his character and Vijay does what his fans wanted excellent dances and superb screen presence. But after an entertaining first half you will enter into a bit lengthy second half. Lokesh tried to add his class into a vijay movie which is why we could see certain problem with the movie. As he said it is a 50% Lokesh movie and 50% vijay movie. That change made us see a vijay movie without cliches but not a classy action movie of Lokesh. And at last Anirudh did a good job throughout the movie. Surely a watchable movie for general audience and a treat for vijay fans.,Master
517,sureshjr,Happy peeps,10,13 January 2021,One and a half years wait is worth for this film. Both Thalapathy and Makkal Selvan has equal character role. A much theatrical watch film.,Master
518,ekdhotheenchaarpaanch,Family entertainer after very long,10,13 January 2021,A big star like Vijay pulls crowd in. Was a tsunami where I watched.

566,krrishdil-99875,"Good plot, Good acting but colossal drag lacks script",6,30 September 2021,"Director builds characters of Vijay and Sethupathi to great heights. Its intriguing to see how Seethupathi's character gets stronger, darker and more powerful while Vijay's character's past is a mystery in the whole film. It seems even more hyped up while Sethupathi's feels real. Though Vijay is student friendly teacher but film never makes the case for his bizzare lifestyle, his past or even his craze among students. Still you can take this but script goes too dull in the second half.Build up for a colossal Good vs Evil fight gets dead rut. While you expect some great measures from Vijay to win over hearts of baddie juveniles, especially after the cruel murder of 2 kids, but it goes into typical masala entertainment mode. All of a sudden the great master minded villain behaves dumb and hero keep his swag.The build up in the 1st half needed better some script in the 2nd half which could have made it a real epic.Sethupathi is just brilliant in the movie. He brings real rowdy fear. Vijay is cool, witty and has a great swag. .",Master

641,aadhavanmersal,Master - A True Masterpiece,10,19 January 2021,"Master is well made action entertainer, after thuppaki this is a game changer for Thalapathy his acting is top notch specially in the pre interval jail sequence he is such an underrated performer and he just shattered the screen with his dance in vaathi coming song also we need to appreciate his fitness at the age of 46 expecting more movies like this from him.Bhavani Vjs has created a lot of haters due to avengers and his recent movies but from master he made all those into positives. Truly a terrific performance i can say Master is Vjs's ghilli.Lokesh screenplay is top notch, people can say its long and slow but each and every scene has some things for audience to cheer most of the people criticized the pre climax advising scene and the arrow fight but when i watch the movie with family audience they were enjoying those scenes most of the fans are celebrating it and lokesh cleverly managed both class and mass audience.Ani's bgm and songs were terrific specially the vaathi kabadi the entire theatre went crazy and the pre climax jail fight bgm fully goosebumps.Finally Lokesh he can easily do a complete lokesh movie like kaidhi but he didnt do that becuase vj has a huge fan base and if vj did a complete lokesh movie im sure most of the people wont accept it so what lokesh did is 50% lokesh movie and 50% vj movie now this is accepted by all type of audience and movie is a Industry hit. so next movie he can confidently do a complete lokesh show with vj.As true cinema fan when am watching the movie for the 1st time i thought this going to create a wave like thuppaki and now its happened.",Master

787,heim-53506,Master Piece,10,28 January 2021,"Master is an unique movie, despite the stars I liked the way they were shown. Especially JD is the jolly, lazy, drunken character while Bhavani is the mass villian with a tight punch.
Few of you didn't like the film or were disappointed, but don't say it isn't a loki film or it's a vijay film. The characterisation says alot. Thalapathy isn't shown as usual. Honestly I liked his look, he looks so young with swag.
Some of the scenes could have been trimmed or left out, but overall the film is extraordinary.
My rating is purely for VIJAY, VJS, Loki and ani, they killed it (THALAPATHY FAN).If you don't like the film then ignore it instead talking bad...you should consider it's not only the work of the actors/actresses also of the crew and technicians. This counts for every movie!!!",Master

805,chandufsl,JD and Bhavani,10,13 January 2021,"A modern commercial Masterpiece which will pave way to more grounded and story focused films with relevant themes. #vijay shines every scene with a absolute killer body lauguage. Intentionally Mellow screenplay which takes it time to settle but once it does there, is no stopping the momentum. Sethupathi is brilliant as usual, a sinister antongonist. Watch out for Andrea! Malvika does a magnificent job but the screen stealer has to be Arjun das, A career defining performance. Great Music which fits the story and brilliant..Cinematography. Overall a Brilliant vijay film and a masterstroke direction from lokesh. Must watch, totally worth the wait!

Back in the early 200s, Vijay had showcased a diversified genre of movies such as
Romance, Drama, Action but he is now Framed inside a scenario of so called Mass Image. Unless he breaks the ice breaker, his movies will have same outcome.

First half is very interesting,comedy, dialogue and story will run in a smooth way, but coming to second half it just put into a war between only vijay and vijay setupathi and just roam in the two persons only, so it is for some time get goosebumps but it will not end continues for 01hr:30min will get some bore
And coming to interval scene and climax scene definitely you can reach your expectations and vijay
Six pack in last scene will get goosebumps for girl's fans, And last an interesting message for collage student's , Vijay setupathi story was very nice
But it is a lengthy movie
For vijay and vijay setupathi fans it is
Super duper hit to Blockbuster range
For mass fans it became as
Super hit
For normal audience
Above average to hit
For classical and family audience
It just okay,They can recieve it
And overall it is in hit to super duper hit
Coming to my opinion
It is 3.5/5 stars when you can recieved it's story
And for me it is Blockbuster.",Master

870,aravynde,JD V BHAVANI,10,14 January 2021,"Is Vijay reinventing his own formula? Or are we witnessing a Vijay 2.0? Maybe it's too early to comment. But you could sense Vijay telling Lokesh: ""Listen, I've been there, done that. Let's see what you can do."" Which is why we get those imaginatively put together scenes with JD, where he cooks up a love failure story from Mouna Raagam, 7G Rainbow Colony, Punnagai Mannan, and Kadhal Mannan. What is more tempting is to watch Vijay associate himself more with the lesser of ""woke"" films that he has been part of, for quite some time. He is top-notch here. Personally, I would like to see him in the Fan zone.",Master

Vijay sethupathy's character creation is very very nice. After watching this film all the people Definitely would appreciate vijay sethupathy.Vijay's Charcter is not look like his style in this movie.. In this movie vijay acted in different style it completely different but people all love that character..In this movie vijay act casually, calmly after the his transformation against vijay sethupathy is top notch ...Anirudh musical did better and better now a days.. Anirudh and Vjiay first combo movie is Kaththi. I gave a rate for Kaththi is 7/10.. Their second combo movie Master I gave a rate 9/10... His music and scores are top notch.. He was the biggest backbone for master...Lokesh Kanagaraj 1st two films are historical hit. now his 3rd master is Master blaster hit🔥🔥🔥🔥. He did fantastically in the direction and screenplay side is awesome.. And we are all wait for the next film with Vijay...Negative:First half of the movie is excellent there is no lag and it runs smoothly and normally but second half of the film is little bit laggg.. B'coz some Unnecessary scenes are there we don't need that all that is biggest lag...
Secondly lot of character are acting in the film but they come short time only but it's okk ..Final Conclusion: The master movie was released for this Pongal. This movie is really taken to enjoy .. In second half, There are a lot of unnecessary scenes, it would be very good if it was avoided. if it was avoided this will be a great movie but this movie have been downgraded to good movie ...I gave a rate for this movie 9/10",Master

He delivered good acting in a plethora of good films in the late 99s and early 2000. His thirst for being the next superstar has salvaged his films and has somehow gotten lucky with the combination of Atlee and AR Murugadoss. Every other film has been disaster and mere word of mouth cannot help sustain his films. Good thing I watched on Prime and did not spend money in theaters . Vijay should make more money producing films.,Master

979,vjremy,A unique commercial film carried only by Vijay and Vijay Sethupathi,7,16 January 2021,"Firstly I'd like to say, I am a huge Vijay, Vijay Sethupathi and Lokesh Kanagaraj fan. So going into this film was a huge fanboy moment for me, although writing this critical movie review, I'm going to be unbiased and honest. An important thing I must say is, that this film is not one for Lokesh Kanagaraj fans. And that's what upsetted me the most.Matter of fact let me just get all these negatives of the movie out of the way before I talk about why this movie still is a watchable and entertaining movie that will still be remembered in the Tamil Industry. Unlike Managaaram and Kaithi, Lokesh fails to include his unique approach to cinema and add his elegant screenplay style to complement this highly anticipated movie. In reality, he has played it very safe, in accommodating Vijay's mass commercialism, similar to what Karthik Subaraj did with Rajinikanth in Petta. Both these filmmakers were appointed because of their youth and exuberance to modern day film, and their unique craftsmanship to making good cinema. But both of them buckled into serving for their respective main lead actors' fans, making a good strong commercial film, but not one that we expected. For Karthik it was him being a massive fan boy to Rajini, but for Lokesh I believe it was just him playing it safe knowing how much crores of budget money is in this film. That's the massive downside, because this makes for some pacing issues, much needed trimming of certain portions, one dimensional characters, poor song placements and lack of depth for the anticipated rivalry of Vijay and Vijay Sethupathi in the film. Pacing issues concern the slowness in the college portions, which in reality wasn't needed to be that long. The whole premise of that college portion was for him to get kicked out anyways, and then those college characters would just come and go later as well. So that could've been done with a huge trimming and been replaced by more depth with the Juvenile story and also JD and Bhavani rivalry . Because that is what the fans wanted the most. Vijay vs Vijay Sethupathi, hero vs villain, directed by Lokesh Kanagaraj. Although, unfortunately, JD and Bhavani's meeting came in a bit late, and into the second half was a bit rushed and untidy. Song placement is something Lokesh was also debuting in, which showed. This is because I believe ""Kutty Story"" was done at the wrong place, kind of subdued the terror of how bad this Juvenile centre is when on the first day of a drunk professor coming in, all these druggo kids are still just dancing and singing with him. ""Andha Kandha Pattaka"" was also unnecessary and could've been cut and replaced, just seemed to be there to comply with being a Vijay movie. Something that also really bugged me was the climax fight, and that was because the whole story built up to this. JD and Bhavani's first face to face meeting (not counting their accidental meeting before lol), and there is so much rage and vengeance both have against each other for their own respective reasons. This is what this whole anticipation of this film was about. But they messed it up because of one tiny little thing, unnecessary comedy really subdued what should've been an epic climax fight. How can two people, hero and villain be singing and dancing while beating each other up. It just limited how epic this battle between two Kollywood heavyweights should've been. It's how I felt about it though, I know many people who still liked it that way.Ok now we've got all that out of the way. Let me say something. Despite its flaws, this is easily one of Vijay's best films out of his recent years. It's not an overblown, massive budget commercial film, it's not a near 3 hour political snore fest and it's certainly not a Vijay glorification film. Lokesh has made it unique, not in the way we are familiar with, but in a very entertaining way. This is because we see Vijay with completely different mannerisms and attitude in a classy acting performance as JD. His whole first half performance was eye opening, he played it beautifully. Second half when he makes his reformation from alcoholism, he does slightly go back to the normal, massy Vijay, but it is still different and carries the film. Although, we do have someone who has outperformed Vijay in this movie. And that is, none other than Makkal Selvan, Vijay Sethupathi. What an actor, what a performance. So natural and casual in conveying a vile and Joker-like villain in Bhavani. Pure evil with his casualness, dry humour and sarcasm. Reminded me of Joker, and Muthupandi from Ghilli. Played his role terrifically like he always does, such a versatile and talented actor who now puts himself easily with the names of Kamal and Vikram.",Master

1090,prathu-80041,Worthwhile premise with spotty execution,6,30 January 2021,"The length of the film exposes very clear pacing issues that is felt throughout the film. The exposition takes far too long to play out and by the time the conflict is set, 1.5 hours have elapsed.The film repeats itself constantly. While watching Vijay bash some thugs is fun to watch the first time around, the effect is soon lost once these action scenes repeat over and over again. When the climax happens, all action feels dry and extremely overdone.The film introduces Bhavani as an antihero. While VJS has seen roles like this before, for the first time ever his antihero character very quickly dissolves into pure evil. The film portrays Bhavani as someone to sympathize with, then immediately does a 180 to remove all sympathy that was built over precious minutes of the film. Disturbing or intense moments are inappropriately broken up by random bursts of humor. Other than these aspects, acting by VJS absolutely shines as the audience is moved and sometimes disturbed by the wrath of the villain. Vijay's character has an excellent arc backed by good acting and great screenplay.All in all, Master is all over the place, from Kabbadi to Drug addiction. A great premise which takes way too long to expose itself is soon blurred by a mix of terrible pacing, constant side-tracking, and dry, repetitive action. While Master aims to tackle many social issues, this turns out to only be surface level as behind the scenes is a masala flick seen year after year from the Tamil film industry.",Master

1095,darshininelson,New & Exciting!,10,31 January 2021,"I will admit I am a huge Thalapathy fan and it sucks to be stuck in the UK and be forced to rely on OTT platforms to do a release and all the negative reviews about how it might take away from watching it in the cinema worried me. Although nothing could stop me from watching it twice in 24 hours, HA!Yes. My British husband and I thought it was fantastic. We loved everything about it including the the mining archery scene that we later found out the next day over a long post-Master viewing video call analysis with my family in Malaysia, that my father thought the scene was completely bonkers. My husband an archer, then preceded to correct him to state that, that particular bow and arrow featured in the film is actually capable of doing that!I think each of Director Kanaraj's films are incomparable and Master is in its own Cali bre thoroughly enjoyable. We found it well paced and the fight scenes were well thought out.The thought process behind every scene, every occurrence, down to the finest details. One instance I particularly resonated with me in the writing was, going from JD's world shattering around him to the scene where Bhavani's being scrubbed down by his goonies. The shift in emotions. I almost choked myself.Truly fantastic. My husband and I thought it was rather clever, thought provoking and a grand performance from both the Vijay sir's.Finally, Anirudh - my Spotify is on repeat!",Master

1115,krishmuthu-87468,No Complaints. Awesome Movie!!!,10,14 April 2021,"Before I get into this fairly simple review, I would like to point out two things.1. This is Lokesh Kanagaraj's first commercial mass-entertainer movie so you should give him some grace in how he directed it, wrote it, etc.2. Please understand that this movie is an entertaining movie, mainly centered on Vijay and Vjs. So, do not expect this movie to be like his (Lokesh) previous films: Kaithi and Maanagaram. I abhor the fact that people are saying things along the lines of ""this is not a Lokesh film"" or ""very disappointed in Lokesh, not his usual movie"". While some parts of the movie are of his taste, this movie won't completely be like his previous films. So to the people who are complaining about this, suck it up and move on. This is an insult to the director who has worked extremely ardently and tediously to create this movie.Now, to start the actual review... normally, I would go into explicit detail with the beautiful parts of the movie, as well as, the flaws that require some fine-tuning. However, this movie is, for the most part, logical and appealing to watch!!! To justify my rating, I need to compare this movie with previous Vijay films.Mersal: In Mersal, Vetrimaaran lifts a ferris wheel. Atlee probably adores Vijay too much to the point of making him a super-human. The magic scenes are also unrealistic in some parts. The villain (SJ Surya) is a pretty weak written character with little to no character development.Bigil: Bigil, similar to Mersal, has an extremely weak (weaker than Mersal) villain. Atlee mushed a variety of films together, making the movie progress at an uneven pace.This is why I love Master. Lokesh Kanagaraj, for being his first mass-type film, did an outstanding job. The story is simple and straightforward. The movie progresses at an even pace with some lag in the second half, but it's all for the Vijay mass appeal. In terms of acting, Vijay and Vjs did an outstanding performance. Many people love the movie because of its acting compared to the story. I also need to compliment Anirudh's songs and bgm. The movie would've been nothing without this awesome music to back it up.To conclude, the movie is an enjoyable mass entertainer, and I hope everyone will see it for just that.",Master

1131,srnithin,Master Review,10,22 May 2021,"Like any good filmmaker, Lokesh Kanagaraj knows that it takes a fearsome antagonist to turn a protagonist into a hero. This is why he begins Master by establishing the myth of his antagonist Bhavani (Vijay Sethupathi). A teenager who is sent to an observation home by the powerful men who had killed his family, Bhavani becomes the very thing that the system doesn't want juveniles to become - a ruthless monster. JD is a professor in a college in Chennai... the kind of professor who has a hip flask ready in his pocket, an advice ready on his lips and a kada ready in his arm for a punch! Naturally, the students adore him, and the management wants to get rid of him. And circumstances lead him to sign up for a teaching role at the observation home, where Bhavani runs the show. The scenes featuring the hero and the villain have distinct visual tones - cool blues for JD and fiery red for Bhavani. There are some cool shots, like an overhead shot that shows the correctional facility divided by sunlight and darkness, with JD in the sunlit area. In the end, it is the charismatic performances of Vijay and Vijay Sethupathi that keeps us rooting. Vijay dances like a dream, and puts his coolth to good effect in the college scenes. He also manages to sell the moments when he has to offer advice. With many heroes, these portions might have come across as preachy, but here, they just feel right. And Vijay Sethupathi manages to steal the show. His casual acting style only elevates Bhavani's cruelty - even though it is tonally removed from the fabulous intensity with which Mahendran plays the character's teenaged self. The final confrontation between the two actors has a couple of rousing moments, helping end the film on a high note.",Master

1151,xkamal-859-593346,"Master for the Masses, a clash between critics and masses'.",10,15 January 2021,"Lokesh as a director who
was earlier praised for his directorial
brilliance. People forget that the directors know their output better and what exactly the reviews will be for every scenes they sketch. This movie's screenplay was written for the masses and any flaws we think we identified are not actually flaws but part of the plan to script a hardcore commercial movie that will have a great run for money. This is one movie where all the department like music, dialogues, acting did their own jobs well. All the mixed reviews were already expected by the team but they are definitely successful in providing a hit movie with a different shade of Vijay too. This movie, as he mentioned in one interview will take lokesh to a new dimension - pan India, the rural and also international. Its a win for master team in all aspects.
*I saw the movie in a rural theatre this was the best movie me and my family enjoyed in theatres in a loong time. There wont be any trimming , cos all ppl enjoyed through the 3 hrs runtime.
At the end the clash between the critics and actual crowd will end up like both of them enjoying the movie equally.",Master

Due to well exploited lightings, cinematography and background score, Thalapathy's charm was so good on the screen.

1176,rooj75,A long awaited film that unfortunately did not live up to its hype.,3,23 March 2021,"This being a Lokesh film, I was expecting a tighter story with good pacing and editing. However, we got none of those. I also want to preface this review by saying, I was more disappointed because of the high expectations I had going into this film. I was let down big time.The Bad:
The story was all over the place and was generally a mess. It had great potential, however, it was ruined by the need for it to be a mass commercial entertainer befitting it's star lead.The film spent time developing a particular setting but then abandoned it for another so abruptly. We were then supposed to care for those characters from the first half later on but couldn't because they weren't developed enough for us to have any emotional attachment to them.Other parts of the film lacked logic and I could not get behind why they were doing what they were doing. This created a disconnect and I wasn't able to immerse or invest myself in the story.The film suffered from poor pacing and progression of story. Some parts seemed to drag out (ex. The archery car chase went on way longer than necessary) while others felt rushed and not fully fleshed out (ex. After all the build up, JD's real backstory was revealed in passing with a couple sentences by a minor supporting character...). There was also a lot of talking/explaining and not a lot of showing. Which is saying something considering this is a 3 hour film! They really could have used the time better.As much as I appreciated the social messages in the film, I found it highly unconvincing and frankly annoying that, on more than one occasion, the bad guys had a sudden change of heart and turned ""good"" after JD lectured at them. I'm not saying everything has to be solved with violence and bloodshed but they could have at least made those character developments a bit more believable.This was neither of the lead pairs best performance. Vijay's emotional scenes were lacking if not a bit cringeworthy. He did a lot better in the action/mass and comedic scenes and I think many of his fans would like that. However, I was more disappointed in Vijay Sethupathi's acting here. There was very little of his usual charisma and fun he brings to the screen (he felt almost monotone at times).Although there were some sentimental heartfelt scenes, they seemed a bit too heavy-handed and used more for the shock value so those missed the mark for me.I don't think this film is suitable for kids even though I know a lot of them who have seen and enjoyed it nonetheless (since censorship in Indian films are never taken seriously). Trigger warnings: drug abuse, physical violence, child abuse, child death, mourning parents.The Good:
The thing I was looking forward to the most with this film was seeing Vijay and Vijay Sethupathi share a screen and I thought the pair had great chemistry. The actors and their respective characters played off each other well in every scene they were in together and those were my favourites (ex. Their first meeting and the ending climax fight scene). Vijay Sethupathi has great chemistry with everyone he acts with so I wasn't really surprised.As mentioned before, I did appreciate the social messages that were conveyed throughout the film. Hopefully, having Vijay endorse these messages can help further the change in real life or at least enough for there to be a conscious awareness of them now in the general public.Vijay's comedic scenes/dialogues were fun to watch (especially when he used different movie plots as his ""backstory"").Anirudh did really well with the songs and bgm. ""Vaathi Raid"" sung by Arivu was my favourite, though it was only used as a background score in the actual film.Final Verdict: If you are a Vijay fan or are just looking for a mass commercial entertainer to pass the time then this is for you. But if you are looking for a well developed story, you will have to look elsewhere.",Master

A strong villain after Mersal arguably the best villain Vijay has had in his 28 year career so far the clash was very engaging despite lack of story the screenplay and the clash kept the movie very engaging so did Anirudhs background scores and fantastic songs. The characterization of JD and Bhavani was spot on very surprised to see Lokesh balance both the good and evil in just his third film that too w two big stars.
Only negatives about the movie is the Lorry chase and the placement of kutty story expected it to be along w the movie and story as did the other songs. And the second half characterization of JD as he transforms which Vijay did pull off really well but the drunkard JD will remain a career top performance and fan favorite. Hopefully many top stars choose commercial movies like this from now on and break the stereotypes in Tamil commercial cinema",Master

1250,shivank-92291,THALAPTHY-SETHUPATHI steal the show!,10,17 January 2021,"First big movie release of 2021. Absolutely loved the film. Thalapathy Vijay gives yet another mind blowing performance, but for me the surprise was seeing Vijay Sethupathi as Bhavani(this character will have a cult following), portraying yet another iconic villain after Vedha. Thalapathy's JD was a new kind of character with respect to his other characters... this portrayal showed us a more vulnerable side of him, and him doing action in a different way, which makes the movie worthwhile. Vaathi Coming and Kutti Story is a treat for Thalapathy fans. Watch this film if you're a Thalapathy-Sethupathi fan!",Master

1262,rowankasim,Vijay vs Vijay Sethupathi,10,15 January 2021,"The Vijay vs VJS - This Deadly Combo is worth enough to watch this movie. Everyone will definitely love the action sequences, attitude & dialogues of both Vijay & Vijay Sethupathi. It's perfectly balanced Vijay (50%) and VJS(50%) film. Anirudh's BGM plays the most important role in this film. Though this film has simple screenplay & story, Thalapathy Vijay has done something special which you didn't seen in any of his previous films & you will definitely enjoy it with full smile at your face. This film is new attempt of Mass Commercial Entertainer for Lokesh Kanagaraj. So don't compare with his previous experimental films like Kaithi & Maanagaram.",Master

1264,rascalrameshh,Top Notch,10,13 January 2021,"Smashing solid hit..Director Lokesh Kanagaraj not only impresses us with the making, but he serves a lot of unique 'Thalapathy' moments on a large platter.
The writing is pretty neat, with special mention to the way the characters are sketched. Though the premise is not new, Lokesh has managed to present the movie in a different way.
Seeing Vijay on big screen after more than a year is more than enough for his fans. The actor has made the character his own and has delivered a good performance.
He excels in the stunt scenes as well. The much hyped combo of Vijay and Vijay Sethupathi has lived up to the expectation. Vijay Sethupathi is menacing as the cold blooded killer.
The cat and mouse game between the two actors are top notch. The drawback is the slightly long second half, where the engagement takes a hit.
The fights are rooted to reality, at the same time, brimming with innovation, with the pre-climax fight in particular, conceived and executed brilliantly.
Anirudh Ravichander's songs are a huge hit already and the BGM elevates the mood of the movie. The lighting during a lot of portions remind us of Lokesh's previous film Kaithi and it captures Vijay's charm beautifully.
Overall, the movie lives up to the expectation and is a commercial-entertainer that will quench the cinema thirst of fans after the lockdown.

1269,bksk-26805,Total Disappointment and an Eye Sore,2,13 January 2021,"Another Dark movie to the list of Tamil Movies. Lots of action but not family friendly.
Usually Vijay's movies cater to wide audiences of all age groups such as kids. Director and Die hard fans should come out of Delusional disorder that their Heroes should be portrayed only in Mass Roles beating Goons.I hope his next movie with Nelson satisfies all age groups and sects of people. The BGM is way too noisy and pounds your heart. The Good old days of Vijay's Family Entertainment is gone and it's all now for his fans who can brag about new non existent Box Office records. Vijay should get back to making 'Feel Good' Movies.Plus

-Too Noisy,
-Vijay's repeated Mannerism
Too many characters",Master

No storyline, boring and one time watchable. He focused more on making a commercial film and left the storyline. Typical vinay movie. Only bgm and vijay sethupathi are good in this movie.",Master

A Good One.💯",Master
