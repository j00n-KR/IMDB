0,Leofwine_draca,Solid thriller with more realism than most,7,5 January 2013,"A solidly effective Tom Clancy thriller that sees reliable action-man Harrison Ford adopting the Jack Ryan mantle and going after a gang of IRA terrorists. PATRIOT GAMES might not have quite the verve and excitement of its sequel, CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER, but it still provides plenty of decent thrills along the way.Things get off to a great start with a fantastic opening set-piece (sadly, the rest of the film never quite equals this moment) which ably sets the plot in motion. What follows is fairly predictable, but nonetheless engaging, as Ford finds himself and his family on a hit list. Sean Bean is the chief bad guy, and not quite as effectively nasty as he would be later in his career; put it down to inexperience maybe.The rest of the film is populated by familiar face after familiar face. You get the then-new actors (Polly Walker, Samuel L. Jackson) and the reliable old-timers (James Earl Jones, James Fox), and they all run through their scenes efficiently and with gusto. It's also nice to find an American film in which the IRA aren't quite presented as the freedom fighters battling the dastardly Brits, as of course the real-life situation was a lot more complicated than that.",Patriot Games
1,SnoopyStyle,good but could have been more intense,7,8 November 2015,"Jack Ryan (Harrison Ford) has left the CIA and is in Britain speaking to their military. His wife Cathy (Anne Archer) and daughter Sally (Thora Birch) get caught up in an assassination attempt on Lord Holmes (James Fox) and his family in London. Ryan saves the day. Sean Miller (Sean Bean) is captured while his brother is killed. Kevin O'Donnell (Patrick Bergin) escapes. He leads a splinter group of Irish terrorists along with his girlfriend Annette (Polly Walker). They break out Miller and set off to take revenge on the Ryan family.This is a good but not great Jack Ryan movie. Harrison Ford does this type of role quite well. The film could have tighten the tension a bit more in the first half. The courtroom achieves little. Sean Bean screaming at Harrison Ford after the shootout would have been more intense. His escape could have been a great car chase but it's surprisingly static. Other than the cold blooded killings, there's nothing interesting there. Even Jack and Cathy's phone call before the crash could have been more intense. He has literally escaped death and yet he's so coy about the danger. I do like the section where he's looking for the terrorists in North Africa with the satellite. It's cerebral and probably the most memorable part of the movie. On the other hand, the terrorists seem to be everywhere which seems odd. First they take the slow boat to America, then escape to North America and then somehow return back to America.",Patriot Games
2,Hitchcoc,How About a Little Common Sense?,7,14 September 2001,"I really like Harrison Ford. His boyish smile and his pained workmanship approach to life in his movies is really enjoyable. I thought his character was fine in this movie except the writers had him doing ridiculous, almost comedic, things to get himself into trouble. We have this bunch of Irish terrorists, one of whom has gone off his hinges because of the loss of a brother, going bananas in his obsession with killing and punishing Ford's character. So, knowing this, what do we do. Oh, I know. Let's go to the most deserted, unprotected place. Let's take along the political figure the crazies are after, and leave them unprotected. It doesn't matter that the wife and daughter have nearly been killed. Let's stick them out there in as much harm's way as possible. There is a lot to recommend this movie as far as atmosphere and a presentation of the zealots that create the situation. But, what do you know, Hollywood has to once again make them superhuman, virtually impenetrable, with the tenacity of the shark in Jaws. This could have been a finely crafted thriller. The situation is set up wonderfully. The terror is there. Isn't it enough to be looking over the shoulder at every move. It ends up being another Indiana Jones conclusion, incredibly contrived, and totally unbelievable. I wanted to like this because I like Harrison Ford and Tom Clancy. It could have been so much more, if the script didn't fall back on every formula imaginable.",Patriot Games
3,kosmasp,It's not a game,7,20 March 2021,"The movie does use quite a few cliches - but when you have Harrison Ford in the lead Jack Ryan role ... I mean can you really be mad at the movie? Maybe you can, I reckon I can't. Still the movie has its flaws and its strength at times, the former especially evident towards the end, when our main bad guy throws rhyme and reason ... overboard (I guess pun intended).Up to this point we have to deal with an American tourist who is at the right place at the right time ... those Americans ey? Always the good doers ... well in US movies mostly at least! Good actors add to the gravitas of the movie and hold up the tension of it - and make you look the other way instead of cringe at certain moments ... again at least it was the case with me",Patriot Games
4,gavin6942,Action Spy Thriller,6,8 December 2015,"When CIA analyst Jack Ryan (Harrison Ford) interferes with an IRA assassination, a renegade faction targets him and his family for revenge.The actors who played Jack and Caroline Ryan in ""The Hunt for Red October"", Alec Baldwin and Gates McFadden, were unavailable. Baldwin had committed to perform in ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" on Broadway. In 2011, Baldwin says he did not appear because of ""sleazy Hollywood tools."" I just want to take this time to say that Harrison Ford is the definitive Jack Ryan. No offense to Baldwin, and no offense to Ben Affleck, who are both being excellent actors in their own right. But Ford just has the right look of an experienced agent, and someone you expect to get in combat with another spy.",Patriot Games
5,jboothmillard,Patriot Games,6,15 September 2005,"This is quite an interesting idea, basically someone ruins a plan and then he and his family are the new targets. When CIA cop Jack Ryan (Harrison Ford) ruins an assassination, maybe intentionally, I'm not sure) he then becomes the new target. These people want to get his family involved as well. These nasty people are lead by Sean Miller (Sean Bean), and there is a really good fight scene near the end between him and Ryan. There are some pretty good chase sequences in the film, but I think it is Ford and Bean that make the film really good. Also starring Samuel L. Jackson as Lt. Cmdr. Robby Jackson, James Earl Jones as Adm. James Greer, Richard Harris as Paddy O'Neil and Bob Gunton as Interviewer. Good!",Patriot Games
6,ccthemovieman-1,A Super Thriller,10,20 March 2006,"This is an outstanding thriller, a movie I have always enjoyed watching since it came out. Apparently a number of people also did since a few sequels followed featuring the main character ex-CIA analyst ""Jack Ryan,"" played by Harrison Ford.Sean Bean was excellent as the revenge-obsessed villain, a member of a ""splinter group,"" as its labeled not really an IRA extremist, but one too out-of- control for any group. Ford is the man best able to stop him and the film is very interesting start-to-finish and smart enough not to overdo the violence. Suspenseful is probably the best word to describe the movie as Bean goes after Ford's family. Anne Archer, as Ford's wife, along with the rest of the cast, actors such as Patrick Bergen, James Earl Jones, James Fox, Richard Harris and a young Thora Birch make this a well- acted movie.This is simply one of the best thrillers I've ever seen and almost every scene is interesting.",Patriot Games
7,rmax304823,Patriotic Gore.,7,15 May 2007,"Jack Ryan (Harrison Ford) is a CIA analyst who saves a royal Brit or two during an attempt by some Irish patriots on their lives. A captured IRA terrorist is Sean Bean, whose brother Harrison has just killed in self defense, and Bean will never give up his quest for revenge on Ryan and his family.It's always interesting to see what kind of heavy a movie gives us. The heavies are a chronicle of the times. In this instance it's unlikely that a story from Tom Clancy, a robustly nationalistic Irish-American novelist who plays with guns, is going to paint the Irish Revolutionary Army red, for reasons both sentimental and commercial. Nope. The gang that's after Harrison Ford and his kin are an OFFSHOOT of the IRA. It's a splinter group, see. Not the actual IRA. This splinter groups is so mean that they kill an IRA chief who tries to restrain them. And as if that weren't enough, Sean Bean turns out to be too evil even for the ""ultra-violent splinter group"" (as Ford describes them). Bean is an iconoclastic loony who shoots the members of his own splinter group when they try to dissuade him from killing Ford. Bean's group has one member, himself. I guess that should put enough distance between the evil Sean Bean, on the one hand, and the Auld Sod on the other.After the initial violent encounter, the movie turns into a game of cat and mouse, with Bean the cat and Ryan the mouse. Bean escapes from captivity, pursues Ryan to Annapolis, and tries to kill everyone in sight. The climactic fight is done by the number in typical action movie style. Two speedboats on rough seas in the middle of the night during a thunderstorm. Bean as the pursuer produces a submachine gun and kills has compadres, then takes off after Ford in HIS boat. Bean sprays the other boat with lead. Tears it to shreds and sets some convenient tanks of gasoline afire, but misses Ford. Pursuer leaps onto burning boat at top speed, which is unforgivable if only because it lends itself to such an appalling pun (""jumping bean""). In mano a mano combat, Ford (a CIA bookworm and schoolteacher) whips tough, highly trained Bean. Ford jumps off boat at last minute. Flaming boat with wounded Bean smashes into some rocks and explodes. Ford get medal, settles on couch back at home and hugs wife and daughter to him.The best scene in the movie shows us the CIA officials watching an infra-red live satellite feed of an attack on a terrorist training camp in Libya. The good little green dots sneak up on the sleeping bad little green dots. They make all the bad dots stop moving. Then a green helicopter comes in and the buildings in the camp blow up in big green flares. All we see are the satellite feeds and the tense faces of the viewers, including Ford's. Ford gulps as he watches the bad dots get murdered and blown to smithereens. Watching total strangers die seems to make him uncomfortable and, who knows, maybe a little guilty.What do we know about those terrorist camps anyway? Who teaches whom, and what do they teach? Do the ""Red Brigade"" and ""The Shining Path"" and the ""IRA"" and all these groups that are essentially irrelevant to one another, if not at odds, actually come together for a greater cause? What's the cause? What do they learn at a desert training camp that they couldn't learn more comfortably in a flat in the city? Target practice? Is that IT? Clancy had his fingers on the pulse of a nuclear submarine in ""The Hunt for Red October."" A techie manque reveled in the details.But all of this is more conventional stuff. It's a more personal story with a more generic villain. We don't learn much more than those trainees at the terrorist camps learn. In the end this is mostly recycled stuff from other action movies. In fact, this is the second time that I can remember Ann Archer getting into a car accident in an attempt to protect her daughter and coming up with nothing more than a becoming bruise on her eye. (The other scene is in ""Basic Instinct."") And Ford has a fist fight with a young terrorist, during which Ford is repeatedly punched in the face and body, and he emerges with a trickle of blood from one nostril and a similar trickle from the corner of his lips. Didn't ANYONE involved in this -- makeup or writers -- ever watch a fist fight in elementary school? A punch in the nose doesn't result in a trickle of blood from one nostril. It leads to a gusher that splashes down your shirtfront, and when you try to wipe it away it leaves your face smeared. (See ""Shane"" for a good example.) As an ordinary action film it's not bad. Harrison Ford plays Jack Ryan as quiet and modest, but flawless too. In ""The Hunt for Red October"" the character had a fear of flying and that made him human like the rest of us. No such blemish mars the hero of this entertaining but routine action movie.",Patriot Games
8,ma-cortes,"Jack Ryan witness a terrorist attack on a royal member , he intervenes and kills one of the attackers , but terrorists seek a lethal vengeance",7,31 January 2013,"Jack Ryan's entry with lots of noisy action , tension and thriller . The title of the film is a reference to an Irish Ballad called ""The Patriot Game"" which is popular song within the nationalist movement . This is a second installment of the Agent Jack Ryan with lots of gun-rattling action , suspense and intrigue . Ryan (Harrison Ford) is a high officer from CIA , married (Anne Archer) and with a daughter (Thora Birch). Now Jack Ryan is a history professor at the U.S. Naval Academy and former CIA agent on holiday in London . As ex-CIA Analyst Jack Ryan interferes with an IRA assassination, as he thwarts a terrorist attack , outside Buckingham Palace on Lord Holmes (James Fox who replaced his brother Edward Fox) , a member of the royal family . Then a renegade faction (Sean Bean , Polly Walker , Patrick Bergin) targets him and his family for revenge . Now Ryan goes back in action for the most vital assignment of his life : to save his wife and daughter . CIA staff (James Earl Jones, Samuel L. Jackson) sanctions a covert operation against terrorists by sending crack soldiers into Libya (the country in North Africa in which the IRA train is never named, although a map of the camps is shown, and they are clearly in Libya) under the command of SAS (however in the book, it is carried out by French special forces).This blockbuster is an excellent adaptation of the novel by Tom Clancy , companion to ¨The hunt for Red October¨ by John McTiernan with Ford taking over the role of Ryan from Alec Baldwin and third part ¨Clear and present danger¨ again with Harrison Ford , who's becoming the king of trilogies ; furthermore subsequent outing starred by Ben Affleck titled ¨The sum of all fears¨ by Phil Alden Robinson . Extraordinary nail-biting action scenes, specially when Ryan is trapped and spoils an assassination attempt on an important member of the Royal Family , and of course , the breathtaking final images . Good production design , in fact , the CIA scenes were filmed at the actual CIA headquarters ; this was the first time the CIA had ever done such a thing. Interesting screenplay plenty of twists and thrills by Donald Stewart . Sensitive as well as thrilling musical score fitting to action and suspense by James Horner . However , he borrows part of his score from Aliens in scoring this film , Horner like all composers, often re-uses his own material. The satellite attack-watching sequence features rather emotional, thinly scored music , but the soundtrack is, in fact, taken quite directly from the slow movement of Dmitri Shostakovich's 5th Symphony . Colorful and atmospheric cinematography by Donald McAlpine . The picture was well directed by Phillip Noyce, an action movies expert , but he directed ¨Blind fury¨, ¨The Saint¨ , ¨The Bone Collectors¨ and the following : ¨Clear and present danger¨ among others . Rating: Above average, the film will appeal to Harrison Ford fans and Jack Ryan novels followers .",Patriot Games
9,blanche-2,terrific,8,27 March 2016,"Harrison Ford stars in ""Patriot Games"" from 1992, an adaptation of the Tom Clancy novel. As the years went on, we were able to see Ben Affleck, Alec Baldwin, and Chris Pine play Clancy's hero, Jack Ryan, who appears in quite a few books.There was a time when there were films about Irish terrorists, but today, they have been replaced by another group. Former CIA analyst Jack Ryan is visiting England with his wife and daughter when he foils an abduction/murder of members of the Royal Family as they leave the Palace.The masked men were Irish revolutionaries, and Jack kills Paddy, the younger brother of one of the revolutionaries, Sean Miller (Sean Bean). He vows revenge, and he'll stop at nothing to get it. That includes escaping as he's being moved from one prison to the other and traveling to America.This is a very exciting film, with a long and detailed finale that is both scary and fantastic.Harrison Ford is the ultimate movie star, hearkening back to the classic stars of the '30s and '40s. Likable, versatile, and strong, he makes a great Jack Ryan,a man as determined to protect his wife and daughter as his nemesis is to destroy all of them. Anne Archer is lovely as his doctor wife. Sean Bean is hateful, as he should be. Lots of familiar faces -- Patrick Bergin, Thora Birch, James Fox, Samuel L. Jackson, James Earl Jones, Richard Harris, Alum Armstrong (""New Tricks), and Hugh Fraser (""Poirot""). Quite a cast.Truly excellent -- if you never saw it, see it now. Ford plays Ryan again in Clear and Present Danger.",Patriot Games
10,sunwarrior13,A Straightforward Spy Action Thriller,8,11 November 2014,"Patriot Games is a film adaptation of Tom Clancy's novel of the same title and it acts as a sequel to The Hunt For Red October.It features Harrison Ford as Jack Ryan together with a cast that includes James Earl Jones,Anne Archer,Sean Bean, Patrick Bergin,Samuel L. Jackson and Richard Harris.The story takes us to a mission of Jack Ryan's attempt to foil an assassination in which he succeeds that incurs the wrath of an Irish radical terrorist group that plots a revenge to take his life and that of his family. Philip Noyce is at helm for the film.Author Tom Clancy was mad about this film adaptation as it watered down the story in the original novel.Too bad that it was reflected in the screenplay as the global intrigue provided by terrorism becomes some sort of a cops-and-criminals action thriller.In effect,it became more of a straightforward spy action thriller with simplistic political themes that viewers do not need to dwell on.Also,the decisions made by Jack Ryan as a CIA agent makes him look more like an intelligent cop rather than a spy agent.But in spite of it,the acting was great.Harrison Ford did well as Jack Ryan after taking over Alec Baldwin proving the producers that he was a good choice.Great performances can be said for the cast.The technology in it can be absorbing despite the fact that it has been more than 20 years since this film was released.Finally,the action sequences provided lots of tension,entertainment and excitement although some of them could remind the viewers the action-adventure movies Indiana Jones especially with Ford involved in it for they are somewhat out of place for these type of political thriller especially the chase scenes.",Patriot Games

12,hitchcockthelegend,"Good guys are real good, and the bad guys are real bad.",7,4 March 2008,"Patriot Games is a more than serviceable thriller, perhaps a bit out of date when viewing it now, but still a very effective good against evil piece. The source material is so dense and intricate it was always going to be hard to condense that into a 2 hour movie but I feel the makers manage to keep it fleshy whilst making the respective characters interesting and watchable. The acting on show is more than adequate, Harrison Ford is great in the role of Jack Ryan, he manages to portray him as a sensitive family man who can step up to the plate when things get ugly, and Anne Archer is solid enough as the wife and mother caught up in the web of nastiness unfolding.The baddies are led by the brooding Sean Bean who is a little under written, whilst Richard Harris is sadly underused, but the action set pieces make their mark and thankfully we get a riveting final reel that cements the steady ride we have under taken. It is formulaic to a degree, but that is OK if the combined efforts of all involved are spot on, and here they are, 7/10.",Patriot Games
13,Theo Robertson,"Oh Good , A Film Where The IRA Are Bad Guys ....",5,21 November 2002,"...... Oh hold on they`re not the peace loving pacifists of the provisional IRA they`re a mad mental IRA splinter group that this film is at pains to point out have nothing to do with the "" nice terrorists "" who murdered over 1800 people in the 70s 80s and 90s . To be fair to the film adaption of PATRIOT GAMES the source novel suffers even worse from this objectionable point where the bad guys are not the IRA but a distinct breakaway organisation called the Ulster Liberation Army . But this is still a naive film . As far as I know the SAS don`t go around illegally wiping out terrorist training camps ( If only they did ) and once again we see an IRA terrorist played by an uberhunk . This happens with disturbing regularity in movies: Sean Bean , Pierce Brosnan , Richard Gere , Brad Pitt all have played Irish terrorists . Listen next time someone makes a film about the IRA ( Which I hope will be never ) can we see a short balding actor like Danny Devito or Joe Pesci take on the role ?Politics aside I still don`t think much of PATRIOT GAMES . It`s just one of those average generic revenge thrillers that doesn`t have to feature IRA terrorists , or terrorists of any ilk. If the hero was walking past a bank and stopped an armed robbery , or walked past a drugs bust and shot one of the drug dealers you could have a film with more or less the same plot and structure -  and a lot more credibility  Patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel. It`s also a poor excuse of an action film",Patriot Games
14,Hey_Sweden,"A solid follow-up to ""The Hunt for Red October"".",7,23 September 2018,"The second Tom Clancy adaptation to reach the big screen was this fairly intelligent, well-executed action thriller, which sees its hero, retired CIA analyst Jack Ryan (Harrison Ford, inheriting the role from Alec Baldwin), on vacation in England. Not content to stand by and do nothing, he intervenes when terrorists stage an attack on Lord Holmes (James Fox), a member of the British Royal Family. These bad guys represent some sort of faction of the IRA, and they resort to ruthless and very violent methods. As fate would have it, Ryan manages to kill one of the terrorists, and that chap is the younger brother of the volatile Sean Miller (Sean Bean). Miller, naturally, swears vengeance, even as a crony played by Patrick Bergin tries to keep him focused on their groups' activities.Aussie filmmaker Phillip Noyce does a fine job with the various action scenes, making this very slick and topical entertainment. Ryan is more of a traditional action hero than he was in ""Red October""; there, he was more overwhelmed and more suited for office jobs. The role allows Ford the opportunity for some intense and sometimes indignant acting, an aspect that has often been his stock in trade. The fact that his family (Anne Archer plays his doctor wife and Thora Birch his savvy (but thankfully, not overly precocious) daughter) gets targeted by the psychotic, vengeful Miller automatically has the three of them earn our sympathies.Only towards the end does this start to become increasingly conventional and less believable, but then, this being a Hollywood film, it seems that there are certain demands to be made regarding how things will be resolved. We have to see the hero rise up righteous and kick lots of bad guys' asses, even though up to then they're seen as very formidable.The cast is first-rate, although some of the actors don't get a lot of material with which to work. Bean is a great villain, to be sure, although his grief over the death of his baby brother is certainly understandable. Samuel L. Jackson, Polly Walker, J.E. Freeman, and James Earl Jones fill out the supporting roles nicely. It's especially fun to see Richard Harris, one of Irelands' finest, cast as an IRA spokesman. You can see familiar actors such as P.H. Moriarty, Ellen Geer, Ted Raimi, and Bob Gunton in small roles.James Horners' score itself is familiar - sounding at times like his music for ""Aliens"". The production design (by Joseph Nemec III), cinematography (by Donald McAlpine), and editing (by Neil Travis), are all excellent.Overall, a good thrill ride. It's hard not to think about plot holes while watching, but basically ""Patriot Games"" shows you a good time.Seven out of 10.",Patriot Games
15,LeonLouisRicci,Dry and Slow of Pace with Spurts of Suspense,7,3 January 2014,"There are some Deadly Serious Flourishes in this slightly above Average Spy Thriller. The Film, from the Novel by Tom Clancy, is another, the second, slightly dry account of James Bondish type stuff without the Intense High Tech Action. Clancy's, forte is behind the Scenes and is generally of the more Cerebral Stuff. Hero Jack Ryan is an Analyst, not a Secret Agent.But that doesn't stop Hollywood from putting Him, no longer on the Payroll but not for long, into the center of the ""Action"". In this one it is actually Ryan himself that triggers the ire of an IRA Fringe Group, by foiling an attempted Assassination of a British Royal.From then on its Cat and Mouse as our Hero begs back in among the Spooks to protect His Family. There is one Spooky Event in front of Computer Screens that makes Ryan feel a bit Queasy. This is a Powerful Scene but one wonders why all the Emotional Display, after all He's been in this situation before. Hasn't He?Anyway, this is a not bad Film with a good enough Cast and some Intriguing Set Pieces, but it does have a rather Slow Pace with Spurts of Family in Peril Tension.",Patriot Games

I was a big fan of the Tom Clancy novels at one time and loved seeing them turned into films. Harrison Ford is the best person I could imagine to play jack Ryan. he did a fantastic job.I love Anne Archer, too. She was just so damn desirable in this movie. A special shout out to Thora Birch, who played their daughter. She is just so cute!

17,Calicodreamin,Kind of boring,5,3 September 2019,"I tried to give this the benefit of the doubt for being from the 90s. But even still, it comes across kind of boring. The acting isn't bad, but Harrison Ford is almost aloof through the whole thing and doesn't give off action hero vibes. While there are some good action scenes, they are way too short. And the ending boat scene? You gotta be kidding me. The whole movie relied on ""filler"" scenes.",Patriot Games
18,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Not necessarily bad,7,22 August 2008,"I haven't read the novel, but apparently it wouldn't make much of a difference; Clancy wanted nothing to do with this after reading the first draft. This is perhaps not really a movie based on a book of his, rather more of a Ford one loosely based on an original piece of writing. That doesn't have to be a negative aspect. It's put together just fine. The plot is emotional and straightforward, especially(although not only) compared to The Hunt for Red October. The pacing is reasonable, it's not downright boring. The dialog is plain and unmemorable, if not poor. The acting is sufficient. The characters aren't particularly layered, and one or two could be cut with seemingly no impact on the overall thing. Has Sam Jackson ever seemed so insignificant, before or since? This tries harder to appeal to the masses, mainly by implying sex and being crass. The violence isn't that strong. The language, however, is harsher and in greater amount than its predecessor, with no justification. The action is relatively plentiful(albeit not enough for this to go entirely work as that, nor can it be called an all-out political thriller... they should have picked a direction and stuck with it, in my opinion) in this, and it's well-done and entertaining. I recommend this to those looking for lighter fare than the preceding entry in the series, and fans of Harrison. 7/10",Patriot Games
19,view_and_review,This was no game,6,6 September 2018,"An older retired Jack Ryan (Harrison Ford) is in England for a symposium of some nature. While there he witnesses an attempt on the life of a royal by some heavily armed terrorists. Jack goes into superspy mode, even at his advanced age, and takes out two terrorists while holding another at gunpoint.This action of his makes him a hero in England but he becomes enemy number one to Sean Miller (Sean Bean), an extremist IRA member whose brother was killed by Jack Ryan. Anyone familiar with Sean Bean's cinematic history can figure out what happened to him.I wasn't feeling this movie for two reasons and two reasons only:1.) The sheer improbability of an aged, unarmed Jack Ryan getting involved in a terrorist shootout on foreign soil. Especially when his reasoning was ""it just pissed me off."" It pissed you off? You're a trained C.I.A. agent and former Marine but you can still be motivated to put your life in danger because it pissed you off.2.) The sheer improbability of Sean Miller and friends being able to have the dearth of resources to commit a terrorist act in England and then safely get to America where they'd have the same resources to track down Jack Ryan and family. Is there no place they can't go?Outside of these two crater sized pock marks the movie was good. It was a mix of investigative acumen, military technology, and combat skill. The movie was suspenseful as each side tried to stay one move ahead of the other like a high stakes chess match. There was a lot of maneuvering but it definitely was no game.",Patriot Games

Ryan helps to thwart Holmes' assailants and becomes a local hero. But Ryan's courageous act marks him as a target in the sights of the terrorist whose brother he killed. Now Ryan must return to action for the most vital assignment of his life: to save his family......Oh yes, the film has flaws, the depiction of the Irish is as bad as 'Blown Away', everyone drinks Guiness, listens to Clannad and send Leprechauns as gifts, but this is Hollywood, so it can be forgiven.As for the rest of the movie, it's one of the most taut and intense thrillers of 1992, and furthermore, it's one of Fords last movies where his name guaranteed a hit (fugitive, CAPD, AFO after this), and it still proves he was a major draw.Why? Because Ryan is the Everyman, he's not superhuman, or an action hero, he's just a family man trying to protect his family.Bean is great as the villain, and this film bases it's main plot on family. Bean And Ford meet when Ford is trying to protect his, Ford kills his Brother, Bean goes after Fords, coming around in full circle.It's really well made, with some great support from a who's who of Hollywood.

22,Aaron1375,"Out of the Tom Clancy movie adaptations I have seen, this is my favorite.",9,10 January 2010,"Let me say that I have only seen this one, ""The Hunt for Red October"", and ""Clear and Present Danger"". I enjoyed this one and Red October a good bit. Was not really crazy for ""Clear and Present Danger"", I just for some reason found it rather boring compared to the other two movies. I do not know why this one is my favorite, but it just seemed to work for me in a way the next movie would not. Harrison Ford in the role trying to protect his wife and daughter from the revenge minded IRA terrorist had more of an emotional impact and really got you going whereas Present Danger just was missing that and basically banished Ryan's wife (the character Harrison Ford plays) to nothing more than a guest appearance or cameo. This one is about Jack Ryan who I think works for the CIA, he is over in England and spots in the nick of time a couple of IRA guys about to do some bad stuff. Well he basically thwarts them killing one of them and getting himself injured in the process. Well the other guy ends up going for revenge as the other guy killed was his brother. Some good action scenes and drama in this one and it has a really nice concluding scene. As an added bonus Richard Harris is also in it it in a fine supporting role and Sean Bean is great as the IRA terrorist. Of the three Clancy movies this one to me really hooks you in and has the best plot.",Patriot Games

When the vengeful brother of the slain terrorist (Sean Bean) escapes he zeroes-in on murdering Ryan's wife and daughter (Anne Archer and Thora Birch). Samuel L. Jackson, James Earl Jones and Richard Harris are also on hand, amongst other notables. This is a well-done drama/thriller with an excellent score, realistic tone, top-of-the-line cast, great locations and a ""Whoa Mama"" scene in the first reel featuring the stunning Polly Walker. While the first half promises more than the second half delivers, it's still worthwhile. Ford is at the top of his game as the protagonist.While the Ryan's homestead is on the east coast and many sequences in the movie were shot in Maryland and Virginia, their home scenes were interestingly shot at Morro Bay, Ca, and obviously so. It's more scenic, but it also provided the requisite cliff for the final act. The film runs 117 minutes and was shot in Virginia, Maryland, England and California.GRADE: B-",Patriot Games
24,The_Void,Tight and entertaining little thriller,7,17 March 2007,"Well, I have to say that I don't have much interest in Tom Clancy, as the only film I'd seen based on his work prior to seeing this one was the 2002 film 'The Sum of All Fears', and all I can remember about it was that I found it really boring. Patriot Games is, apparently, the follow up to the 1990 film 'The Hunt For Red October' - I haven't seen it, but to me this film stands up pretty well on it's own so I don't think that is a problem. Patriot Games is a pretty tight little thriller which holds up well despite some questionable plot points and some rather unbelievable goings on. The plot focuses on Clancy protagonist Jack Ryan, a former CIA man holidaying in Britain. He happens to be around when some IRA terrorists make an assassination attempt on some member of the royal family, and thwarts the attack by killing one terrorist and letting the other be apprehended by the police. The remaining man is Sean Miller, and he's not too happy about the death of the other terrorist as it happens to have been his brother. A personal vendetta is then sworn as the terrorist seeks revenge.The film benefits from a decent cast. Harrison Ford isn't the best actor of all time, and here he pretty much sleepwalks through the film (as usual), but somehow he has great screen presence, and since this thriller doesn't exactly demand high quality acting; he fits the role just fine. Sean Bean is his opposite number. Bean is an actor I've never really liked, but he does play villains well, and he manages to make the audience believe that he is hell-bent on revenge. The rest of the film is made up with good support turns from the likes of Samuel l. Jackson, Thora Birch, Anne Archer and James Earl Jones. Apparently, the film puts an untrue spin on terrorist groups; but my advice with regards to that is just ignore it and enjoy the action. There's a fair amount of action too, as the film features car chases, shootouts and various fistfights. It does take a while for Patriot Games to get going; about an hour in fact, but it's not boring at any point, and therefore makes for good entertainment throughout. Overall, Patriot Games is not 'brilliant' by any means; but it's a fun ride and my advice is; just relax and enjoy it!",Patriot Games
25,Mr-Fusion,Serviceable Ford action thriller,6,2 October 2013,"It should be noted that I haven't read any of Clancy's books, so I have no idea how close Ford's portrayal of Jack Ryan is to the source material. But ""Patriot Games"" felt more like a Harrison Ford vehicle than a literary character adaptation. For me, at least. And there's an emphasis in this movie on Ryan as man of domesticity that tends to detract from my enjoyment (I speak mostly of that contrived saccharine ending). That said, it's certainly not without its pluses. There's some nice direction, and Phillip Noyce ups the tension during the action scenes (particularly during the third act showdown and boat chase). The scene with the CIA watching the camp raid via satellite maintains a bitter sense of humor. And as a Harrison Ford flick, it's a bit of a thrill to see him pick back up with the CIA to hunt down the bastards who wronged his family. Plus, there are a couple instances of the dread Ford Angry Finger Point of Doom (thank you for that, Internet). And then at the end, there's that syrupy baby stuff and a contrived smash-cut to credits. Still have a bad taste from that one.6/10",Patriot Games
26,namashi_1,A Superb Watch!,7,28 June 2010,"Phillip Noyce's 'Patriot Games' is a superb film. Based on the novel of the same name by Tom Clancy, comes out a absorbing thriller that lives up-to it's mark in those 115 minutes. The adventures of Jack Ryan were widely appreciated.'Patriot Games' is about a Ryan and his family... and of course the baddies. The film has a powerful protagonist, which makes us 'The Viewers' secure and confident. It offers solid entertainment from start to end! Phillip Noyce's direction is flawless. He has a Superb job! Donald M. McAlpine's Cinematography is eye-catching. In the acting department, Harrison Ford as Jack Ryan is fantastic. Ford, a legend, delivers one of the best performances of his career. Anne Archer has done a good job. Sean Bean as the menace, is menacing and absolutely amazing. Richard Harris, well.. he stands out, as always.'Patriot Games' is a must watch.

27,JamesHitchcock,Tense and Fast-Moving Thriller,7,26 February 2008,"A faction of the IRA attempt to kidnap Lord William Holmes, a member of the British Royal Family who also happens to be a Government minister, but the crime is thwarted by the courageous actions of Jack Ryan, an American tourist in London with his family. During the ensuing scuffle, Ryan shoots dead one of the terrorists, Patrick Miller. Miller's elder brother Sean is jailed for his part in the attack, but is rescued by his comrades, and vows vengeance on Ryan, who is a former marine and CIA operative. When Ryan realises that Sean Miller is targeting his family he returns to work for the CIA to help with the fight against terrorism. There are a number of fairly obvious goofs and plot holes. No member of the British Royal Family could serve as a Government minister, as they are constitutionally obliged to remain politically neutral. If a foreign citizen were being made a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (one of the highest awards in the British honours system) he would be invited to a formal ceremony in Buckingham Palace to be knighted by the Queen in person. He would not be presented with the decoration in his own home by a junior member of the Royal Family. It seems unlikely that any Irish republican terror group would carry out an attack on American citizens on American soil, as to do so would risk losing the support their cause has long enjoyed among sections of the Irish-American community. As others have pointed out, it seems illogical for Ryan to take his family to their isolated summer home to get them away from Miller; doubtless the CIA could have found a safer location for them. The film lacks the political implications of ""Clear and Present Danger"", Philip Noyce's next attempt to film a Tom Clancy thriller which involved Watergate-type misconduct by the President and his closest aides. (That film also starred Harrison Ford as Ryan). Despite the involvement of the IRA, ""Patriot Games"" makes no attempt to analyse the complexities of the Northern Ireland situation. The film also lacks any detailed characterisation. The moral divisions are straightforward- Ryan, his wife Cathy and his CIA colleagues are good and Miller and his gang are bad.The film does, however, have a strong hero in Harrison Ford. Ford has always been good in the thriller genre, and gives another good performance here as Ryan, combining decency with a strong sense of intelligence. Anne Archer and Sean Bean are also good as Cathy and the villainous Miller. There is a good cameo from Polly Walker as Miller's glamorous but ruthless female associate Annette. Despite the occasional implausibilities of the plot, this is a tense and fast-moving thriller with some good action sequences. It is not Ford's best thriller (that must be either ""Witness"" or ""The Fugitive""), but it is nevertheless a good one. 7/10",Patriot Games

29,ElMaruecan82,"A political ""Fatal Attraction"" ...",7,13 November 2013,"Harrison Ford is Jack Ryan, a former CIA agent, coming to London for a conference in British Naval Academy, only to find himself in the middle of a terrorist ambush against a distant cousin of the Royal Family. Well, what do you know, he successfully disarms the terrorists, killing in the process the 17-year old brother of Sean Miller (Sean Bean), while the others manage to escape. Ryan instantly makes it to the top of Miller's enemy list and we understand it's only a matter of time before we get a hand-to-hand confrontation.The time is 100 minutes during which Philp Noyce's ""Patriot Games"" fulfills every premise of an action/thriller: the bad guy's escape, the cowardly attack on Ryan's wife and daughter, a failed (but alarming) one on Ryan, and a cat-and-mouse chase via such exciting tools as political surveillance, mug shots, satellites and glimpses of memory. And after having initially declined the offer, Ryan finally accepts to get back to the CIA (all it took was to measure up how serious the threat against his family was). These are predictable elements meaning to provide the perfect dosage of adrenalin and suspense but what makes them work is the 'intelligence' involved in Ryan's quest for Miller, making him more of a thinker than a typical physical hero. The script insists enough on Ryan's expertise as an analyst.And there is the whole political back-story, as if the so-called ""Patriot Games"" were not without rules, one of them being an understandable yet redundant bit of correctness. Basically, Noyce is extremely careful on depicting the villainous group as an independent and more fanatic branch of the Irish Republican Army lead by O'Donnell (Patrick Bergin) who was part of the initial attack. It's comprehensible for a film with international ambitions to play on the safe side not to lose the Irish audience, but we get the point more than needed. One of the IRA leaders is brutally killed in his bed, by O'Donnell's sexy girlfriend (Polly Walker) and the same O'Donnell kills a friend at short range, so the distance between the IRA and the bad guys is clearly and categorically established. Yet did these precautions matter? For all the political context the script provides, it all leads up to the 'personal' story between Miller and Ryan, Miller who didn't give a damn about fighting for Ireland as soon as his brother hit the ground. Did it also matter when the portrayal of Arabs was more careless? After all, just put your terrorists in any desert camp in 'North Africa' (no need to specify the exact location), throw a name like Gaddafi (Saddam works sometimes) and that's it. I was glad there wasn't any character wearing a red Saudi top hat and shouting some Arab gibberish, to provide the little touch of authenticity. As usual, it's a camp in Libya and like all the camps in Libya, the one that welcomed the bad guys had to be bombed (recent events proved that reality could go that far).Still, it was a nice touch to show the perplexed face of Harrison Ford, during the camp's bombing, looking from infrared screens, wounded 'terrorist' dragging their way out from fire. His reaction to one of the young upstarts uttering an enthusiastic ""Now, that's a kill"" while sipping coffee, says it all, the man has gotten soft, which means in our language, more 'human' and we understand how his 'family' lifestyle turned him into a thinker. And this is the sympathetic little twist ""Patriot Games"" gives us, a different Harrison Ford character, sweeter, gentler, only using force in case of necessary defense. In one of the film's boldest moves, he's prevented from a certain death by a Naval guard. This shows how vulnerable he truly is and how even his determination isn't enough to avoid the worst. Another effective moment consisted on a shot on his face while he stares at a thick cloud of smoke coming from the freeway, indicating that a car (not any car) had crashed. This is certainly one of the film's most haunting moments as you can read the desperation of a man who realizes that his loved ones are also part of these damn games (although you wonder why they planned to kill him since killing his family and letting him live with that would have been enough a revenge) ""Patriot Games"" doesn't bring much freshness to the genre but surprisingly offers a hero who's not your typical cynical macho guy, with marital troubles. Ryan has a beautiful and devoted wife. I could have said that Anne Archer seemed to reprise her role from ""Fatal Attraction"", but the whole film borrows elements from Adrian Lyne's classic, like the car-accident, the big isolated family house, becoming ominous under a stormy night and the mandatory daughter.Indeed, like for every family in trouble, it's a girl that accentuates the defenselessness when family comedies have young boys who wish their daddies would spend more time with them. But Thora Birch manages to appear like a smart but not precocious girl. The whole 'family' vibes feeling is clearly palpable all through the film, and it's pleasantly surprising how it is used even during the few exchanges with the intimidating James Earl Jones and Jack's buddy, played by a friendlier Samuel L. Jackson. Naturally, there is not much family feeling when the climax starts, especially when you got a fight in a speeding boat on fire about to hit rocks, a move that disappointed many Tom Clancy readers.Speaking for me, I've never read Clancy, never saw ""Hunt for Red October"" either (but I'm looking forward to seeing it) so all I had were reverse expectations, I thought I was going to see an action-packed movie starring a super-heroic Harrison Ford, and I was pleasantly surprised by how intelligent and family oriented he was. I guess I'm among the ones who see the half-full glass.",Patriot Games
30,dromasca,A Worse than Average Thriller,6,7 August 2002,"At least I have the excuse that I used a Blockbuster bonus, and rented this movie for free... ...but I am still sorry for the almost two hours in my life that I spent watching it! I am not a Clancy fan, and I am not a Harrison Ford fan. However, I expected a better entertainment from this picture. After all, Clancy had some other books adapted to the big screen with decent results, and Ford played in 'Frenzy' by the time this film was made. What we get is a broken pace thriller, full of stereotypes, with no sex-appeal or gadgets to balance the platitude of the characters and the banality of the action. The bad guys are that bad, that even when one of the Irish IRA fund-raiser tries to be good, he actually does it by betraying his fellows. Harrison Ford's act is that wooden-like that he seems to have suffered of stomach problems while the whole movie was shot. The setting is professional, but simply un-interesting.Getting a 6/10 only thanks to some supporting good acting.

After Ryan saves Holmes, he makes himself and his family targets to the Irish. Will Ryan be able to protect his family? The acting is very good. It's great they were able to get Harrison Ford.

33,inkblot11,"With the hope of peace at last in Northern Ireland, this film's premise may not longer be relevant but its mighty thrills are still present",8,17 May 2007,"Jack Ryan (Harrison Ford) is a retired CIA agent, teaching at the Naval Academy. On a working-vacation trip to London with his wife (Anne Archer) and precocious daughter, Sally (Thora Birch), Jack gives a lecture to members of the British intelligence. He is to join his wife and daughter later, meeting near Buckingham palace. As fate would have it, a violent faction of the IRA is lurking near the royal residence, too, hoping to kidnap a member of the monarchy. They nearly succeed but are thwarted when Jack, acting only as a concerned bystander, shoots one of the bad guys. The others flee, except for the brother of the slain terrorist. His name is Sean (Sean Bean) and he is arrested on the spot and, eventually, brought to trial, where Ryan must give testimony. Although Sean is given a long prison sentence, he vows to get even with Ryan for killing his baby brother. Should Jack be worried? Well, prison breaks do occur, don't they? This is an action film that delivers big thrills. First, the cast is great, as Ford is perfect as the thinking-man's undercover agent and Archer terrific as the supportive wife. Thora Birch, in one of her first big roles, is amazing as the very bright, very adorable young daughter. Then, too, Bean is downright frightening as the malevolent IRA terrorist, with Patrick Bergen and Polly Walker (what an aboutface from Enchanted April!) on hand to scare us as well. The sets, costumes, stunts, direction, and production are all very fine. In addition, the script, based on the Tom Clancy book, is a stunner. While the whole world is hoping that peace, thank God, is truly breaking out in Northern Island, this is a look at what the IRA was. But, in reality, it doesn't matter who the terrorists are in the realm of this motion picture. The film is a thrilling cat and mouse game, of good guys against the bad guys, with the outcome far from certain until the last few exciting minutes. Trust me. If you have never seen this action-packed film, you have been missing something very special, absolutely.",Patriot Games
34,callanvass,It's filled to the brim with excitement and it beats Red October by a country mile!,8,16 September 2013,"I was not a fan of The Hunt For Red October. It was very boring in my opinion. Alec Baldwin never really cut it as Jack Ryan for me, so needless to say. It's refreshing to say that an ideal hero like Harrison Ford took over. Harrison Ford is able to keep your eyes glued to the screen throughout the film, and I was fully involved in his plight. I wouldn't say this movie is action packed. It's more of a suspenseful thriller with cat and mouse stuff. It does the job extremely well as a thriller. It also helps that the Ryan family is a unit, and so likable. I cared about every one of them. This also has one of the most intense finales you'll ever see. It's not very often these days in which I am on the edge of my seat anymore, but the invasion scene at the end will get your pulse rising, but quickly. The boat chase sequence is especially memorable. Harrison Ford is fantastic as I explained. He's not superman, he bleeds, he gets wounded, and he's human. I felt Ford did a perfect job of conveying his emotions, and I was on his side the whole way. I'm not a fan of holier than thou heroes, but Ford isn't one of those people as Jack Ryan. I loved him. Anne Archer is excellent as the supportive wife who reluctantly goes along for the ride. I always felt she was underrated. Her chemistry with Ford was very good. Sean Bean makes for a chilling villain. His morose & psychotic performance gave me the creeps. Thora Birch was cute as a button, and played a very likable kid. Samuel L. Jackson & James Earl Jones both do well in their respective roles, and add class to the proceedingsFinal Thoughts: This is a tense thriller that will make almost two hours fly by with ease.

36,johnnyboyz,"Interesting, involving thriller which offers a little more than others of its ilk but cannot offer as much as its unworldly predecessor.",6,2 June 2013,"Credit where credit is due, Patriot Games gives things a fair old go. Alas, in following the masterstroke that was The Hunt for Red October, it isn't quite up to the task of providing us with a deft; subtle espionage thriller which keeps us on the edge of our seat's and has its runtime fly by. So gnawing, in fact, is the feeling in Patriot Games that it merely strikes us as a project constantly aware of it's bigger brother that it ends up being a project that's a little too eager to impress and unsure of how to spend all its evident energy. A measure of how inferior Phillip Noyce's effort is lies in a scene nearer the end, a scene set in the African desert where an ally of the Irish enemies, who worked undercover for them in London, finally meets up with them following a failure in his operations. Witness the way in which the Irish terrorists eliminate him now that he's outlived his usefulness; witness the obligatory air of generic familiarity about proceedings in this scene, as if we knew what was coming. Now recall how McTiernan's ""October"" ran its course without any such instance.Things have been bulked out in Patriot Games, as if the border-line lone, enclosed locale of the nuclear submarine from before has been identified as an issue and swept aside for somewhat of a globe-trotting escapade that hops from Ireland to Libya bay way of London and Virginia. Gone too is the Scotsman doing Russian, replaced by the Englishman doing Irish – he is Sean Bean and he plays the innocuously named Sean Miller, a member of an I.R.A. rebel cell whose attempts to kill an affluent friend of the British Royal family fails when a certain somebody intervenes thus saving the day although causing the death of Miller's younger brother.The certain somebody is Harrison Ford's Jack Ryan, a man in London on business with his wife and infant daughter charged with hosting some lectures for the C.I.A. when the chaos kicks off and he eliminates Miller's much adorned younger sibling. In spite of Miller's capture, he swears a revenge on Ryan's own family – a family with whom it's already established Ryan has a wonderful rapport; right down to the somewhat romanticised exchange of love between he and his wife set to champagne and candles whilst occupying an exquisite London hotel. Needless to say, Miller does eventually break free of his judicial shackles – his desire to wipe the Ryan family out in an act of revenge is not agreed upon by the rest of the faction but he harbours his grudge anyway. In spite of this, American authorities don't believe he'll come after Ryan.... so naturally, he does and terrorism crash lands on the streets of the United States at a time when, cinematically, this sort of content would have been much more affecting.What is pleasing, however, is that while this is the American thriller whereby the hero actually bleeds when he is caught in combat and needs to spend time in a hospital recovering, the film resists the urge to depict what is essentially a movie-going revenge fantasy. Ryan is both injured and shaken; his family are a target and a threat is at large out there in the wider world. There is a sense of helplessness, of vulnerability – we do not sense that we're anywhere near the likes of 1985's ""Commando"". In spite of its positive core values, it would be impossible for me to say that the film gripped me as much as The Hunt for Red October did, but equally difficult to say that the film was not gripping at all. The film is much more conventional, and it works as your more standardised thriller, but then this might be out of the fact the series' previous entry was of such a high calibre. The heroes and villains are cleaner cut in this edition. Ryan, the charismatic professional and family man to boot, is up against the rough and ready thug who was out to do some serious damage even before they become preoccupied with ruining Ryan's life. One's fondness for Connery's character in the last film not as a villain, but as a complicated personality doing what he was doing on top of the depiction of Ryan essentially as a middle-man hopping between the Americans and the Russians, is sorely missed.And yet there is little room for one to recommend this as a piece of dumb, fluffy entertainment. Its director, Noyce, carves something out of the core ideas that's watchable and feels somehow superior to most in its genre. There is a desire to follow in the footsteps of the previous effort in trying to construct this broad canvas upon which every-which side is depicted in this global struggle against the terrorist threat, but it just doesn't come off like it did before. The success ranges from that of the moderately engaging depiction of police officers back in Britain striving to find domestic IRA members to just plain pointless, as a member of the Royal Family tries to work his schedule around potential terror attacks. While in desperate need of a final act re-write and disappointing in its boiling down to a one-on-one Thunderball-esque boat chase, its biggest crime remains its inferiority to ""Hunt"". The film is not without a certain energy and we invest rather a lot into it, it just doesn't have the dynamism nor guile its predecessor had.",Patriot Games
37,filipemanuelneto,Just another forgettable action movie from the Nineties.,2,3 September 2019,"It all starts with a vacation in London. A quiet US citizen, who happens to be a former CIA agent, is in the right place at the right time, successfully preventing the assassination of a British Queen's cousin by agents of an ultra-radical faction of the IRA. Wonderful, isn't it? But one of the terrorists who died in the failed attack is the brother of another one, who has been arrested but is released by his fellows, embarking on a revengeful journey against the American he holds responsible for the death of his little brother. To defend himself, and to defend his own family, the former CIA agent decides to leave his retirement, knocking on his former organization's door and asking to return to work.Well, if this script summary sounds weird, that's because it is. And that is the biggest problem of this movie that even satisfies those who look for some action scenes. The film is not entirely bad but, in fact, screenwriters were not careful when writing and the details, when they're analyzed in detail, get to the point of absurdity. Since when can you, after ceasing to be a spy, simply ask to return and be immediately readmitted to service? Things are not that simple! And how could an US agent receive a decoration reserved for British citizens in an informal ceremony, in his own living room, from the hands of a sovereign's cousin? Absurd, a total protocol break! Then, there was a deliberate attempt to excuse the IRA and give a neutral, even sympathetic, picture of this organization that, in the past, was responsible for so many dead in real life.Harrison Ford is the man in the movie. He is there at the right time, brilliantly foresees the dangers, avoids death by a close call and still gives the bad guys a hard punch. Nothing special. It's always been the kind of character Ford has done well and there are dozens of movies where this actor is essentially doing this. The same goes for Sean Bean, who is the antagonist, the crazy terrorist who becomes a loose cannon on the deck of the IRA. Even so, this actor is good and deserved to have received better material to work with. Anne Archer is the permanent damsel in distress and Thora Birch tried to make her character a woman-at-arms, but could not shine with such a poorly developed character and almost no visibility in the plot. James Fox does not seem to know exactly what he is doing in this movie, Samuel L. Jackson remained almost invisible and James Earl Jones almost merely played himself.Technically, the movie is regular, with nothing to be said for the visual, sound or special effects used. It's within what we might expect in 1992. The soundtrack doesn't shine or stand out either. The focus was, entirely, on the action and fight scenes, shootings and the final sequence. The problem is that it's all so similar to other action movies that this movie, while entertaining and not disappointing who wants action, turns out to be totally forgettable, having virtually nothing to make it stand out in the amorphous immensity of action movies.",Patriot Games

The first time i just didn't buy the unbelievable safety of the royals ! the second time i just get bored by Ryan's recovery. The movie is thus the wise choice because it took only 2 hours and as it's a revenge and action story the visual is the accurate medium for that instead of endless pages In addition, you got wonderful British and Maryland location. For sure Harrison is the perfect choice because he has the humanity and the broad shoulders to be this superman ! For a Clancy novel, the international crisis is left away but it's his first dig about the stealth commando : in that field, we have again more unbelievable things as they easily follow the trail in Africa (compare it to another track !). Maybe it's was the first time that people was briefed about what can surveillance do and already nobody was asking the legitimacy about administrative offices ordering death abroad without judicial review.

At any rate, I have nothing to offer as far as how closely the movie follows the source material, although I really think this is incredibly important when adapting books to movies.I have read a lot of criticisms of Patriot Games (and even more of the sequel, Clear and Present Danger), and while I agree with mostly all of it, I still think Patriot Games is a good couple hours of good clean cinematic fun. But maybe that's just because I love Harrison Ford. Ebert makes the obvious complaint that Jack Ryan, when he finds himself in danger, sends his family to a remote cabin rather than a secure bunker at CIA headquarters, and it's true that this detracts from the movie, but you have to have a movie somehow, and that's a situation where making the smart, real life decision would cancel out the rest of the movie. If everyone in movies made the smart decision all the time, we wouldn't even have a horror genre, for example.Jack Ryan is described in Clancy's novels as having ""undistinguished features,"" which makes Harrison Ford seem to me like the perfect choice to play him, since I've always thought that, even though he's a brilliant and tremendously loved actor, he can't really act with his face very well. Consider one of my favorite examples of this, the close up shot of his face when he sends that kid into surgery in The Fugitive. You can literally see the effort he's putting into making his face do something moving, and it's just not happening. But the thing it, the shot still works. I don't get it, it's a mystery, as Philip Henslowe might say.Harrison Ford has played more complex characters (and less complex, of course), and Jack Ryan gets better than this, but Patriot Games is a fun introduction of Ford playing the role, and is especially a must see for Clancy fans.",Patriot Games
42,bsmith5552,The Return of Jack Ryan!,8,1 July 2007,"""Patriot Games"" was the second of author Tom Clancy's stories about CIA analyst Jack Ryan to be adapted for the screen. We last met Ryan in ""The Hunt For Red October"" two years earlier in the person of Alec Baldwin. Baldwin was offered the role in this film, but to his everlasting regret, turned it down and Harrison Ford as a more mature Ryan was cast in the role. This story focuses more on the perils of Ryan and his family rather than espionage.Jack Ryan (Ford), a college professor, his wife Sally (Anne Archer), who is also a doctor, and their daughter Sally (Thora Birch) are in Britain for Jack's speaking engagement. As they meet thereafter, they stumble upon a plot by a breakaway sect of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), to murder Lord William Holmes (James Fox) a member of the British Royal Family. The group is led by Kevin O'Donnell (Patrick Bergin) and includes his girl friend Annette (Polly Walker), Sean Miller (Sean Bean) and his brother Paddy (Karl Hayden).Ryan instinctively jumps into the action and foils the assassination plot killing young Paddy Miller and capturing his brother Sean. Sean Miller is distraught over his kid brother's death and vows revenge on Ryan and his family.The Ryans return to their home in Maryland and Jack returns to his job as a professor at the US Naval Academy, Annapolis. All is going well until Miller escapes from custody and is consumed with hatred for Ryan, the man who killed his brother.Admiral Greer (James Earl Jones) and Marty Cantor (J.E. Freeman) visit Ryan's home and inform him of Miller's escape and try to entice him back to the CIA. Ryan refuses. Miller, O'Donnell et al turn up in the US and try to kill Jack but fail. Miller attacks Cathy and Sally in their car causing a crash in which both are injured. This angers Jack who then decides that the best way to fight these people is with the resources of the CIA, so he returns to the organization.A senior IRA representative, Paddy O'Neal (Richard Harris), in the US on a fund raising effort, swears that the IRA was not responsible for the attacks on Lord Holmes and Ryan and his family. Ryan forces O'Neal to reveal the identity of the mysterious woman (annette) whom Ryan saw when the attempt was made on his life, in return for Ryan's not blackballing the IRA.Ryan analyzes the available data and tries to locate the group's training facilities by satellite. The British meanwhile, suspect that there is an insider on Lord Holmes' staff who provides the terrorists with information on his itinerary.As it happens, Lord Holmes will be in the US on a certain date and wants to present Ryan with an award for saving his life. Since Ryan is planning a party for the return home of his injured daughter, Lord Holmes is invited to attend. The terrorists get wind of this, attack the party, killing the guards and.....................................Ford makes an excellent Jack Ryan. He brings a maturity and vulnerability to the role that was lacking in Baldwin. Anne Archer is the perfect foil for him as his wife. Sean Bean almost steals the picture as the hate obsessed terrorist Sean Miller. Bergin and Walker as well, make scary villains as well. Samuel L. Jackson appears as Ryan's friend from Annapolis Lt. Cmmdr. Robby Jackson.Followed by ""A Clear and Present Danger"" (1994).",Patriot Games
43,generationofswine,An Honest Review,10,4 April 2021,"So we have Solo fighting on the same side as Darth Vader. And, no matter how much you love the Ryanverse.... that is always how a certain age group will look at this.But that doesn't mean that people my age can't move beyond it.It's not a bad movie, not at all. They build tension more than a few times that is completely visceral...... and it does a great job showing how the IRA are the terrorist trainers for the globe, even if it's not really the IRA, and it's hard to say for sure if you can even call them terrorists. I still don't know, I still can't tell, the verdict is still out there on that one.But it's not really the IRA, it's a splinter-group, an extremist splinter group that seems like it fits well into the alphabet soup that is going on in the 6 counties in the north. Which, again, makes it believable.And, the IRA member with the beard I think was supposed to be Gerry Adams, which, again, adds to the story.And then, Ford is always watchable and is a great replacement for Baldwin who in the 90s was 50/50 at best and is really more 80/20 now, and that 20 is more because of the directors than his acting.And you get Samuel L Jackson, who you always want to see yell, not yelling, and playing a more serious role than usual, so it's a win-win on every front.",Patriot Games
44,Polaris_DiB,It has it's moments,5,5 November 2005,"This movie has very few things that stand out from other movies of its type. In structure, it has nothing: a man is forced into defeating terrorists to save his family. The man is Harrison Ford playing the same role he does often, the unwilling hero who must negotiate evil to protect his family and ultimately the world. Being that it's a Tom Clancy story, it involves a lot of helicopters.It's worth watching though for maybe a few subtleties. For one thing, the quicker exposition of the plight of the family and how it isn't really overplayed or over-dramatized. In theory, this film could almost be a little more realistic than the usual snazzy explosion-thriller. Also it has one of those ""slam-bang"" endings that is actually pretty exciting. Thus, it has just enough stuff in it to keep it interesting and watchable, though it's extremely forgettable and rather uninteresting.For me the only thing that ended up piqueing my interest is seeing Thora Birch being her usual sarcastic self at such a young age. Whodathought that someone's personality would also go through their acting careers at completely different stages of life? --PolarisDiB",Patriot Games
45,MissSimonetta,The epitome of average,7,15 May 2019,"PATRIOT GAMES is perfectly fine. Aside from some minor plot glitches, there's really nothing wrong with it-- it's just not very exceptional as an action-thriller.The good guys are good without much in the way of inner conflict. The bad guys are bad without the addition of complexity, camp, or charm to make them distinctive. The chases are okay and the soundtrack is atmospheric. But aside from a notable home invasion scene that's genuinely creepy, I can't think of anything that sticks in the memory. It's like the movie was designed to be as inoffensive and safe as possible.But then again, you could do much worse than see this one. If you like Harrison Ford, it's worth seeing.",Patriot Games
46,lukem-52760,BRILLIANT THRILLER WITH AN EXCELLENT FORD,9,22 April 2020,"90's Thrillers are probably the best as for me growing up & loving the 90's pretty much all the great actors had their ""Glory Days"" or at their prime during that time & there was so many excellent Thrillers made back then & we had the greats leading suspenseful Thrillers all over the place like Morgan Freeman with Seven & Kiss the Girls & Michael Douglas with Basic Instinct, The Game, A Perfect Murder & Falling Down & Gene Hackman with Absolute Power & Enemy of the State & Tommy Lee Jones with The Fugitive (Also with Ford) & U.S Marshalls, Eastwood with Absolute Power, In the Line of Fire & The Rookie, Denzel Washington with The Bone Collector, Fallen & Ricochet, Bruce Willis with Die Hard with Avengeance, Striking Distance, Mercury Rising & The Last Boy Scout, Nicolas Cage with Snake Eyes, 8mm, Face Off, The Rock & Bringing out the Dead, among many, many other big stars & many more films from these big stars back in those glory days of the Awesome 90's & the Great Harrison Ford definitely falls into this category of greats who peaked best during the 90's.
Harrison Ford made lots of great Thriller flicks through the 90's with Patriot Games, Clear & Present Danger, The Fugitive, Air Force One & Presumed Innocent, Ford is a legend of Hollywood. Here Ford plays CIA Analyst Jack Ryan who stops an IRA Assassination attempt & ends up becoming the new target of a psychotic terrorist played by an intense Sean Bean & Jack Ryan as well as his family are targeted for death.
Ford as always, gives a great intense & natural performance & is great in this role.
This is a great Political type Thriller with that slick pure 90's Cinematography & look, the beautiful wintry-Autumn time is captured beautifully on screen. The action is fantastic & real with blasts of exciting violence & intense sequences. The music is great too by legendary James Horner & it's well directed by Philip Noyce who is obviously great as making Suspense Thrillers as he made The Bone Collector, The Saint, Patriot Games & it's equally excellent sequel Clear & Present Danger.
The supporting cast is excellent too with Anne Archer, Samuel L Jackson, Sean Bean, Polly Walker, James Earl Jones, Thora Birch, James Fox & Patrick Bergin. Now Sean Bean gives a fantastic & scary psychotic performance as the main cold blooded terrorist named Sean Miller & the legendary James Earl Jones gives a lovely performance as a real nice guy CIA Admiral Greer & close friend of Jack Ryan, also the legendary Samuel l Jackson stands out in another solid performance as another good friend of Jack Ryan's as Roddy.
Everything about this Thriller is top notch & well made for excitement & suspense filled set pieces such as the excellent ""Jack Ryan House Siege"" part & the incredibly intense sequence when Jack Ryan's Wife & young daughter are targeted while driving on a busy motorway, great well crafted scenes & not to mention the excellent first action scene when Jack Ryan stops the terrorist attack in London, a fantastic perfectly acted Thriller & one of the best from Harrison Ford's 90's back catalogue & simply one of the best Thriller's made during the 90's!!!",Patriot Games
47,gcd70,Jack Ryan Chapter II,7,15 October 2007,"The second in what looks like becoming the 'Jack Ryan' catalogue of films sees a change of director and leading star.

48,Agent10,Action packed and tightly executed,7,1 June 2002,"While Harrison Ford added some more star power to this film series, his presence completely changed everything. Jack Ryan's presence in The Hunt for the Red October was more subdued, this version proved to be a more proactive version of Tom Clancy's premier protagonist. While some feel this is the better of the original series, my contention is this film is a far second. It didn't have the star power or the dramatic tension which made Red October so successful. I will say this, it is quite interesting to see Sean Bean and Samuel L. Jackson in early incantations of their current personas. While this is better than most action-drama films, it still ranks below the Red October.",Patriot Games
49,valleyjohn,Not dated well,6,24 September 2020,"Patriot Games hasn't dated well . Not that I watched it back in 1992 - I didn't . It's strange how dated this looks considering the prequel to this , The Hunt For Red October still looks great .Harrison Ford plays CIA analyst Jack Ryan who stops an IRA assassination of a member of the royal family , and renegade faction targets him and his family for revenge.When the author of the book , Tom Clancy , read the script to Patriot Games , he disassociated himself from the film and you can see why .
This film just goes through the motions .
It is mildly entertaining , but sadly it's full of stereotyped characters and actors who can't do the accents .
Sean Bean is awful . I've never really rated him as an actor anyway but who decided he could play an Irishman?? His Yorkshire accent is so strong , he should only ever play a Yorkshireman.Harrison Ford is obviously just there to pick up the bucks and as Jack Ryan says at one stage , He's just winging it .Alec Baldwin will always be the better Jack Ryan .The whole IRA thing feels outdated too . It's been 25 years since the troubles stopped and it seem odd to see on the screen. Obviously that's not the fault of the film makers but that conflict is something else that hasn't aged well , even in an historical way.
Perhaps if they got Irish actors , it would have felt more genuine?",Patriot Games
50,Samiam3,"Fair game, but not great",6,19 June 2009,"I can't say that I know much about Tom Clancy's novels or the character of Jack Ryan. Whether this is a honorable adaptation of the book I cannot say either, but as a thriller, Patriot Games struck me as weak. There are good performances from a sensational cast, a fair level of emotion to the story, and a nice score from James Horner, but the most obvious problem with Patriot Games, is that nothing much happens here.While on holiday in England with his wife and daughter, Jack Ryan foils an IRA assassination attempt on one of the royal family. needless to say, Ryan becomes an automatic hero of Brittan, but shortly after returning home to Maryland, He is targeted by IRA terrorist Sean Miller for assassination, wanting revenge for the death of his brother. Can Ryan protect his family?Harrison Ford plays a great Jack Ryan, no doubt there, but the movie is not as strong as he is. The story doesn't penetrate you in the way that a good thriller should. It is neither dramatic nor clever and is only mildly exciting. To say it is a bad film would be a huge over statement, it just needs work.",Patriot Games

52,davidmvining,Weirdly structured,6,27 April 2020,"I don't really like comparing movies directly, since there's an implication that if one did X than the other should also do X in order to be good simply because the first movie did X. However, I do think that comparisons can be helpful in highlighting how one movie fails to engage as well as it could. Patriot Games is the sequel to The Hunt for Red October, and they both purport to be thrillers, but the second movie in the franchise doesn't work nearly as well as the first. It's not bad, but it just doesn't thrill as much as it could, and highlighting the differences in structure between the two could be illuminating.The Hunt for Red October is a steady build to an exciting conclusion, but Patriot Games meanders around a couple of different plots, with the action and tension pretty much coming to a dead end for a solid half hour, before rushing into a final climax. It's not that Patriot Games is structured differently from Red October, it's just highlighting how Red October works to ratchet up the thrills while Patriot Games moves in fits and starts. Anyway, enough about The Hunt for Red October.So, Jack Ryan has retired from the CIA and is giving a guest lecture in London at the Royal Naval College when he intervenes in an IRA attack on the royal family, killing a couple of the terrorists, and creating a desire for vengeance in one of the survivors, Sean Miller, whose younger brother Ryan killed. This takes up the first major chunk of the film, and it's quite well handled. You see, the problems with this movie aren't in the individual parts, but in how they're assembled because once Ryan has testified at Sean Miller's trial and gone back to America, the movie, instead of continuing to build tension around what Sean Miller is going to do to get vengeance, stops for a while as Ryan settles back into his life in Maryland, preparing for his classes as a history professor for the next semester. It takes some time for the IRA offshoot to free Sean from captivity.But even then, once Sean gets broken out of the transport van (in another well handled tense action sequence that works quite well on its own), the movie settles back in to Ryan receiving word of Sean's escape and then going on with his daily life, including receiving a jokey away from his friend Robby in class. The next time we see Sean, he's on a boat headed towards North Africa with the rest of his IRA offshoot buddies as his commander tells him to forget about Jack Ryan and focus on building themselves up as an army. But then, the very next scene we see Sean in, he's in Maryland with several others from the IRA targeting Jack Ryan and his family. We do get a one line explanation afterwards from his commander saying that he let Sean go to America after Ryan, but it still feels like there's something missing between Sean in the ship to North Africa and Sean in a car outside Jack's daughter's school in Maryland.And, again, the scene of the IRA encircling Jack and his family in two separate locations is really well done, tense, and exciting. I just don't see how it follows from what came before it. When Sean ends up actually showing up at the terrorist training camp in North Africa, having not heard that Jack's family survived his hit, he wants to leave again. And then the movie kind of comes to a stop again. Jack has to research and justify which camp the CIA knows about in North Africa to get a hit on it. Okay, I said I was done talking about The Hunt for Red October, but I guess I lied. This sequence where Jack figures out where to target is reminiscent of the scene with the Joint Chiefs and the National Security Advisor in the White House basement in Red October, but they're handled very differently. In the previous film, Jack figures everything out internally, giving small clues as he works through it, as an argument breaks out around him about how to kill someone, increasing the tension until he breaks it with his explanation. In Patriot Games, he wanders around the CIA offices, getting flashbacks to a couple of points in the film previously, without anything else to help ratchet up the tension. It feels surprisingly lifeless. And then we get the sequence where Jack watches the British SAS from satellite footage attack the camp, after finally justifying it to himself and Admiral Greer. That attack sequence is really good, but it just came after an extended period of surprising lifelessness from the film.The final big sequence is over the top, especially when Jack takes the boat on the water into a storm to drive the IRA away from his family and the visiting royal from his house, but it's handled well enough to work.I think part of the problem with the film is that it tries to encompass too much of the book, which I read once about 15 years ago and remember almost nothing of. However, the movie is rife with examples of an unwillingness to cut from the larger story to find the heart of it. I think they should have largely cut the IRA from the film, not completely, and turned Sean Miller into more of a one man vengeance machine against Ryan. The quest to justify the attack on a terrorist training camp as the movie should be ramping up instead of down really kills the momentum. The center of this story is really Sean Miller's search for vengeance, not a weird pseudo-view of the Troubles that doesn't really address any of the issues at hand. That can be more fully and effectively handled in a book of several hundred pages than a two-hour feature film. As a two-hour feature, it can't be about getting all the sequences you loved from the book, but about what makes the story in its shortened version work.So, the individual pieces are actually quite fun, but it's the connective tissue between them that leaves me scratching my head most of the time.",Patriot Games

It took me ten years to finally see this movie and was shocked to see it was filmed by a nutcase.  This guy edited the movie poorly, worked from a bad script... and relied on Harrison Ford for backup.  I assume they paid more attention to creating a thrilling movie that they forgot to pay attention to the script.This movie fails on all levels.  The two biggest errors was explaining what certain people were doing things and tying up loose ends.(Spoilers?)There's a scene in the used books store where we learn someone's been spying on the bookeeper.  I kept asking WHY???  Suddenly surprises me why are they there?  It never explains this.  And once this scene ends... we never see these strange spys again.  What happened to them?And then it builds up the two irish folks (not the true bad guy) up so they seem rather smart.  Why would they infuriate an obviously insane man? 
During the raid in Africa it never truely explained why they were there.  It never let us know how they seem to be fast flyers and in the end I can't believe I wasted $15 on this dvd.

56,vip_ebriega,"Not in league with the other films, but an excellent thriller.",9,2 October 2007,"My Take: Though loosely-based on Clancy's bestseller, it doesn't totally dumb it down to pure mindless affair. Ford is strong as usual. Don't ask me about Tom Clancy or if this movie adapts Clancy's novel firmly, for I haven't read any of Clancy's novels yet. But rating PATRIOT GAMES as a stand-alone flick, I have to say I enjoyed it a lot, a lot more than one might expect from someone who hasn't read its print source. PATRIOT GAMES manages to provide tight, gripping action sequences amidst its political theme. In other words, its both fun and dead serious on its plot at the same amount of screen time.Taking over for Alec Baldwin who played the role in the first film THE HUNT FOR RED October, Harrison Ford plays Jack Ryan, Clancy's brain child CIA agent, who is sent on vacation by the CIA. When meeting his wife (Anne Archer) and daughter (Thora Birch) in front of Buckingham Palace, he must thwart an assassination attempt on Lord Holmes (James Fox), a member of the Royal Family, by a band of Irish Terrorists. Thru this heroic act, Ryan becomes a public hero, but also the number one target of one of the terrorists (Sean Bean), who bears a grudge when Ryan kills his brother during his heroic attempt. Now, Ryan is back on the CIA and taking on one of the most dangerous mission in his life and career, to save his family.Much of the first things I give this film credit for is the excellent performances. Of course, there's Ford, in perhaps one of his best roles, Archer as a grief-stricken wife who delivers excellent drama in the face of danger. Bean, as well, makes a compelling villain. The supporting cast (including Patrick Bergin as one of the terrorists, Richard Harris as an IRA symphatizer and James Earl Jones as Admiral Greer) add great background characters don't aren't just decorations.One of the best things about the film is how it was shoot. The film is terrifically photographed by Donald McAlpine. This was mostly evident during the opening sequences, the shots of the vibrant desert sands, most especially the chase sequences. Mixed it with Philip Noyce tightly-knit direction and an intelligent script by W. Peter Iliff and Donald Stewart, it makes a film that both looks and feels good.Even considered by Clancy purists as the weakest Clancy adaptation, PATRIOT GAMES is still tight, seat-gripping entertainment that's both entertaining to watch and still doesn't fail to deliver its message.Rating: ****1/2 out of 5.",Patriot Games
57,CitizenCaine,Harrison Ford In Another Tom Clancy Adaptation,7,29 February 2004,"This was one of the big summer movies of 1992. Harrison Ford takes over the role of Jack Ryan from Alec Baldwin in this revenge thriller based on Tom Clancy's book. Ford plays the role perfectly as the ex-CIA agent that is forced to shield his family from increasingly unhinged terrorist Sean Bean. The film opens in terrific fashion as Ford saves British Royals from assassination by happening to be in the right place at the right time. The terrorist leader's sibling is killed in the ensuing battle and later comes for Ford's family. The film unnecessarily delves into IRA politics, etc., dragging the film down somewhat in the middle. The film picks up again with a freeway scene, with the terrorists chasing Ford's family played by Anne Archer and Thora Birch. James Earl Jones, Samuel L. Jackson, and Richard Harris have small supporting roles. The film moves at a brisk pace with the exception of the aforementioned political dealings. The ending is somewhat marred by uncharacteristic heroics in relation to Jack Ryan.

Thinking is not one of this film's strong suits as everything is straightforward.  I really think Clear And Present Danger was better--if not the best--in the series.

Harrison Ford has played heroic characters before, and it proves that he, too, can handle the role of the ""hunted"" instead of the ""hunter"". The suspense surrounding terrorism is really the main ingredient we're looking for, as the royal family of Jack Ryan falls victim to this horrifying ordeal. The acting performances are generally powerful and compelling in a big way that it makes this ultimately satisfying to resist. Only one scene should have been cut: a lady terrorist member in sexy attire killing her lover in bed, which was fairly senseless to the movie.

63,silverscreen888,Seminal and Visually Interesting; the Techno-Thriller pre-1994.,7,28 April 2007,"Perhap the most remarkable fact about this very influential techno-thriller ""Patriot Games"" 1992 is that it took so many decades before such a seminal special-effects thriller was 'realized'. Once all the difficult elements of such a film were brought together, as happened in the case of ""Ben Hur"" and ""Spartacus"" with their spectacular elements, other directors were quick to adopt and extend the techniques pioneered in the original work. This film from author and prolific thriller icon Tom Clancy, was more than a show of special effects, I suggest; it is unusually filled with interesting characters for an adventure of any sort; and director Philip Noyce, working from an honest treatment of the original novel achieved by W. Peter Ili and Donald Stewart was able to keep the clarity of the storyline, in my estimation, moving forward at all points. The feature's cinematography by Donald M. McAlpine and Stephen Smith with art direction by Joseph P. Lucky and production design by Joseph Nemec III) and music by James Horner, worked together quite seamlessly despite the complexity of its presenting a variety of settings, types of scenes, lighting levels and various-sized images. The final battle that decides the outcome of a lengthy duel between Jack Ryan and an Irish terrorist obsessed with his destruction has to be seen to be appreciated, on several levels. In the role of Ryan, Harrison Ford must be lover, father, PhD level professor, friend, ex-CIA analyst, ordinary citizen, and extraordinary hero; by my standards, he does very well with all of these challenges; what sets this film above for instance the comparable ""Da Vinci Code"" is that Ford played a professor successfully and the other film's lead did everything well except that classically-trained actor's challenge. Anne Archer as Ford's wife is mature, and adequate, no more. James Earl Jones is a fine presence as The Admiral in charge of secret operations; Richard Harris has a nice role as a high-ranking IRA leader; James Fox plays a high-ranking Brit powerfully; and the villains in the piece, IRA types, spies on both sides and medical personnel, etc. whether killing, saving, reporting, criticizing or being killed, are all above average or better in skill. The interiors are believable; the psychology of the characters convinced me as a writer at every point. The cross-training and tensions going on between international terrorist groups alone stamps this as a ground-breaking storyline, with its implications of a breakdown of general World order and the heralding of a new Age, only two years distant at that time. The special effects, stunts, visuals and international locations made the film seem to this viewer admirable thought out and realistic at every point.

64,virek213,"Jack Ryan, The IRA, Vengeance, And Family",9,26 January 2017,"The late Tom Clancy's novels that feature the character of Jack Ryan, senior analyst at the Central Intelligence Agency, have been the basis for a number of solidly crafted but also interesting action films. THE HUNT FOR RED October, released in early 1990, was the first of those films; and it had Alec Baldwin in the role of Ryan. When Baldwin declined to return to the role, however, the producers looked to another great actor, namely the many who had played Indiana Jones and Han Solo but had now become something of a thinking man's action hero: Harrison Ford. That gambit paid off big time, both commercially and artistically, when the second Jack Ryan film came out in 1992, in the form of PATRIOT GAMES.In PATRIOT GAMES, Ford is nearing the end of a vacation in London with his wife (Anne Archer) and daughter (Thora Birch) when he witnesses a violent attack on Lord Holmes (James Fox), a member of the Royal Family and a minister of state for British-ruled Northern Ireland. The attack is carried out by an ultra-violent faction of the notorious Irish Republican Army; and it's an attack that Ford manages to thwart by mere seconds, killing one of the terrorists (Karl Hayden) and wounding his brother (Sean Bean), while their cohorts (Patrick Bergin; Polly Walker) manage to escape. Bean is put on trial and convicted for his part in the attack, but he vows vengeance on Ford. That vengeance is meted out after Bergin and Walker effect Bean's violent escape when, just days after returning to the U.S., Ford is almost killed by one of Bergin's associates at the Naval Academy, and Bean almost kills Archer and Birch on a freeway near Annapolis. Ford now has to rejoin an organization, the CIA, that he had only recently stepped down from in order to do in Bean, Bergin, and Walker, while at the same time hosting Fox at his Maryland home. The whole saga comes to a climax there, where Ford, his family, Fox, and several of their associates come under attack from the IRA radicals during a violent storm.While there are obviously a number of differences between the book and the movie (too many, in fact, for Clancy to stomach, as he disassociated himself from the finished product), PATRIOT GAMES nevertheless works quite well just the same. The success of the film is owed in no small part to the presence of Ford in the role of Ryan. Although his performance in PATRIOT GAMES (and in the later CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER) is markedly different from Baldwin's in THE HUNT FOR RED October, the end result is still a high-level action film with psychological thriller elements, and a climactic siege at Ford's house that has elements of CAPE FEAR and STRAW DOGS, along with a harrowing speedboat chase to bring the film to a stunning close. The upping of the violence and sex, and a couple of 'F' bombs in the dialogue, meant, of course, that PATRIOT GAMES had to get an 'R' rating. However, none of these elements are gratuitously used in any way. Alongside Ford and Archer, James Earl Jones returns as CIA director Jim Greer; and the film has good turns from Samuel L. Jackson, and legendary Irish actor Richard Harris as the IRA's principal US ""bag man"" Paddy O'Neill, who only coughs up the whereabouts of Bergin and Bean after Ford issues a less-than-veiled threat against him in an Irish-American bar in Washington.Australian director Philip Noyce, who had directed the 1989 psychological thriller DEAD CALM, directs PATRIOT GAMES very impressively, keeping the emphasis on the back-and-forth between Ford and Bean, the latter of whom is an incredibly scary radical Irish heavy. The late James Horner, who had already done scores for films such as STAR TREK II, STAR TREK III, BRAINSTORM, AN American TAIL, and AN American TAIL: FIEVEL GOES WEST, provides an equally fine score here as well, utilizing various Irish musical motifs (with an assist from wind soloist Tony Hinnigan).The striking intelligence shown in THE HUNT FOR RED October (and again in CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER) is shown here in spades in PATRIOT GAMES, which is why I'm giving it a '9'.",Patriot Games

Harrison Ford is the best action star of his generation and this movie is a brillant example of how Hollywood can sometimes make a good action picture.

Even if it stars someone like Harrison Ford, the plot is simple and there is not much of impression throughout it. Not any cliffhanger or plot twist near the end. Ford is good as always but he doesn't save the film. Sean Bean as usual is the villain and what a surprise! He dies again... the problem I have with this film is not only the story but the title as well. The Irish characters are Patriots and every act they do is for North Iralend their country. But in the case of Jack Ryan (Ford) and Sean Miller (Bean). Their actions are personal so it doesn't fit the movie's title nor the intentions of the other characters. At least the movie provided a few action and intensive moments to light things up. Not that bad.",Patriot Games
68,richieandsam,Such a great 90s film...,7,6 June 2013,"PATRIOT GAMESWhat a great thriller...I remember this getting released back in the 90s... and I was never really interested. I can't remember why because this is a great movie.The movie is about an ex CIA agent who foils an assassination attempt on a member of the royal family. Because one of the terrorists got killed during the attempt, the IRA want revenge on him. They travel to the USA and try to kill him and his family.The story is brilliant. Great action and on the edge of your seat thrills. It has got some good twists that I never saw coming and the movie runs very smoothly. I didn't get bored at all and really enjoyed this from beginning to end.This has got a host of stars. Harrison Ford takes the lead and he plays it brilliantly. I like Harrison in a lot of movies, especially thrillers. My favourite thriller of his is What Lies Beneath. Patriot Games also stars Anne Archer, Patrick Bergin, Sean Bean, Thora Birch, Samuel L. Jackson & James Earl Jones. I think all of these actors are great. I also think this is the youngest I have seen Thora in a movie. I would say the only thing I wasn't very keen on was her character. The way she reacted just seemed very unrealistic to me. People were getting shot and attacked all around this little girl and she stayed calm and even smiled at one point. I am pretty sure any other little girl would be scared, crying or freaking out.The movie has a great 90s feel to it. I always think that the 90s released a lot of great thrillers. In fact most of my favourite thrillers are from the 90s. The Juror & Sleeping with the Enemy are 2 that stick out in my mind that were exceptionally brilliant.I will give this 7 out of 10.A great thriller with a great cast list...

70,Flagrant-Baronessa,Lacks oomph,6,17 July 2006,"This is one of many Harrison Ford action thrillers from the 1990s and it follows the standard formula for a film of such nature, so expect no cinematic miracles. Ford is former CIA agent Jack Ryan and he gets tangled up in so-called patriot games when he interferes in an IRA assassination attempt in England. Suddenly his whole family is in danger because the IRA guys want revenge and Ryan needs get back to his old CIA ways to be able to defend his wife and daughter. While Patriot Ganes is a well-made film, it lacks the oomph of most of Ford's other action films and I found myself truly unable to get into the plot at several points.Had it not been for Ford's imprinted 'good guy' status and emotive eyes, I would probably have pulled for the 'bad guys' in Patriot Games, because Sean Bean has never been sexier than in this film. What stuck with me besides rentable bad guy Sean Bean, was an interesting use of an Enya song during one murder in the beginning.Patriot Games is possibly heavier on the thriller part than the action because, frankly, not much happens during long segments of the film. This would be fine as a means to build up tension in the plot, but there are never any satisfying culminations to follow the slow, suspenseful pace until the very end--and these scenes can hardly be labeled as satisfying. Maybe satisfactory. I think the whole film is most accurately labeled satisfactory. 6/10",Patriot Games
71,manuel-pestalozzi,Perverse fascination,5,6 August 2008,"This movie makes part of my collection, and I watch it now and then. Probably for the wrong reason. Basically it is a modern Western. Good guy can't stand bad guys doing bad things and steps in to put things right. He has a family to protect and the family is threatened. This gives him extra inspiration for his violent defensive actions. Nothing entirely new under the sun.It is mainly the family aspect that makes me gape at Patriot Games again and again. Or more exactly: It's the house the family lives in. I have seldom seen a place that looks more uncomfortable, inside but particularly from the exterior. I am not sure if this was intentional but somehow it reflects the awkward, painfully strained TV-commercial domesticity of the Ryan family perfectly. Like the house, Mr Ryan unnecessarily and inelegantly exposes himself to the extended forces of nature which, in his case, come in the form of mad terrorists. No sign of daily domestic routine can be spotted anywhere in that house. One of the most grotesque scenes shows mother and little daughter both deeply wrapped in coats and shawls sitting on a swing never meant to swing people on a porch never meant for a sojourn longer than two minutes. They are strangely lost folks, the Ryans and I just wonder what that is supposed to mean (probably nothing at all, but once a film is let loose the fantasy of the viewer runs wild). As the lack of warmth is evident in this beautifully filmed movie (even the final fire on the boat seems to be greenish rather than red), I soon started to wonder if the Ryan's place was built explicitly for Patriot Games or if real people normally live in that place. Well, I certainly wouldn't envy them.",Patriot Games

The story is very simple even if the movie is one big (useless) plot. Ford is an ex-CIA who is tourist in London and wonder by wonder....just by coincidence, he saves the life of some royal member who were attacked by some splintergroup from the IRA, and the whole picture is too much based on so called Hollywoodtheories about those terrorists that you wonder if they just never happen to see the bloody news..... But good, it's time for vengeance and terrorist Sean Miller decided to chase Ford as he killed his younger brother during the action of Ford. Just guess how it ends....... Is it a bad movie? Not really, the acting is fine....Ford in his usual style, Sean Bean playing a perfect role from maniac and Samuel L. Jackson.

Well paced and developed. It's rather straightforward and doesn't really break the mold when it comes to this types of movies, but the cast is great and the plot is very well put. It's interesting when it needs to be, but doesn't beat you over the head with unwelcome explanations.

75,buckikris,Jack Ryan Gets Involved In An International Deadly Game,8,19 March 2019,"This is the second chapter of the Tom Clancy series. I am so glad Harrison Ford took over the role as Jack Ryan. Alec Baldwin did a great job in The Hunt For Red October; but Ford brings more to the role.Jack Ryan( Harrison Ford ) is a former Marine and CIA advisor. He is now an author and professor at the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. He is on vacation in London, England with his wife Kathrine (Anne Archer) and daughter Sally( Thora Birch). When he starts to meet up with his family outside Buckingham Palace; shots ring out. Ryan realizes he is caught up in a terrorist plot involving the I.R.A. ( Irish Republican Army) and The Royal Family. In order to save himself Ryan defends himself, and shoots a member of the IRA. It turns out that he shot the leaders younger brother. Sean Miller ( Sean Bean) is the leader, Ryan killed his brother he vows to get revenge on Ryan. Miller is then arrested and taken into custody by the British authorities.When the British Authorities transport him ( VIA patty wagon), Miller somehow escapes. He and his fellow soldiers eventually meet up. They have a plan to travel by cargo ship to America. Miller is hellbent on getting back at Ryan, and taking his pack with him. When Ryan is informed of what happened by Admiral Greer ( James Earl Jones ), he is concerned. Now Ryan and his family have to be extra alert at all times. Ryan is extra cautious looking over his shoulder and informing his closest advisors about any unusual activity. His house is under surveillance by DSS officers; and security upgrades are added to his home.When Miller arrives in Maryland he targets Ryan's wife and daughter on the highway. Kathrine and Sally are almost killed in a traffic accident, trying to escape Miller. When this happens Ryan tells Greer he wants back in the CIA.. As an advisor he is able to keep tabs on Miller and his members across the globe. He is also able to have access to the satellite images they get back from a particular IRA camp in northern Africa. The use of these satellite images help the military/British authorities keep track of their movements 24/7.One night the military carries out a top secret operation killing most of the IRA members in this North African camp. While this is in progress Ryan and other top CIA operatives watch it being carried out from a war room. When he believes Miller is one of the causalities; he believe he and his family are safe.At the Ryan's home it's been weeks since the accident. Sally is finally coming home and the Ryan's are throwing a welcome home party for her. It's a small party and the only ones in attendance are Ryan's closest advisors. The house is still under security watch by the DSS agents parked around the home, just in case. While they are celebrating Sally's return, a call comes in. Ryan gets word that 6 IRA members survived the attack and one of them is Sean Miller. They inform Ryan they are coming to his house and the DSS agents have been alerted. After the call things get intense, Ryan tries to call the DSS agents outside the house, no answer. He informs Admiral Greer and Robby ( Samuel L. Jackson) quietly whats going on. All of a sudden the power gets cut, now they need to watch their backs. Miller and his crew have infrared goggles and are prepared for a fight to the death. While the power is out Ryan makes sure his family is safe. He and Robbie then go and check the house, little do they know that a traitor is among them and later reveled. When Ryan does confront Miller, the battle continues in The Atlantic Ocean. It is up to Ryan to save his family, before they all become pawns in Miller's deadly game of revenge.This is a great action hit from the early 90's; but it doesn't seem dated at all. The only disappointment was the very ending. I wanted to do a REALLY! it just didn't add to the film at all. Patriot Games is a must because Harrison Ford is exceptional; and Sean Bean delivers in Patriot Games.",Patriot Games
76,ozthegreatat42330,Not quite up there with The Hunt For Red October.,8,26 March 2007,"This was not a bad film. I respect Harrison Ford as an actor, but he did not hold a candle to Alec Baldwin as Jack Ryan. Too, the problem with this film is that it was taken out of sequence from the Jack Ryan Books of Tom Clancy. It is still a good thriller and worth watching, but to me it fails to hold up to the earlier film, a much closer approximation of Clancy's novel. The one repeated and enduring role was James Earl Jones as Adm Greer. I would have suspected if Baldwin had kept to the part and better script writing had been involved this might have fared better. And what was the purpose of plugging Richard Harris into the film for the very few moments he was on film. It was an insult to his caliber as an actor. The same holds true and then some for ""Clear and Present Danger.""",Patriot Games
77,rollernerd,Doesnt live up to the first,6,26 April 2021,"Welcome back to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Today's movie review is the action thriller Patriot Games (1992) the sequel to the Ryanverse series. In this flick we are given a new lead actor on the same character, this time played by the coolest legend Harrison Ford, who as Ryan foils an IRA assassination plot on a royal family. Due to his heroic efforts, Ryan is now on the lifelong enemy list of IRA fanatic terrorist named Sean Miller played by the LOTR alum ""One does not simply"" guy Sean Bean. What happens next is a swift revenge played out by Miller while Ryan is trying to protect his family, choose whether or not he should join the CIA and trying to track Miller and his gang.The film feels more of a Cape Fear style thriller than a political thriller which I thought the Ryanverse was supposed to be all about. You have a storm-tossed speed boat mixed with psycho-mayhem. There are a few characters that I would have liked to see more screen time including Samuel L. Jackson as Robby - Ryan's navy mate. The performances from the cast are all great in particular Anne Archer who plays Ryan's wife. We see her during the car climax scene in the midpoint of the movie, the post trauma from that event including her kicking butt. Thora Birch who plays the daughter is great in particular with her scenes with Ford as father and daughter discussing what they should have for breakfast, which ends with toast or toast. Ford does well in his suits and portray Ryan as a sensitive family man however can switch the gear and turn on the cerebral military level when it is needed. I didn't mind the new actor lead - and to be honest, Ford plays a strong Ryan.However, the movie for me doesn't live up to the first - Hunt for Red October as Patriot Games feels more mainstream, as it lacks political implications and fails to analyse the complexities of the Northern Ireland situation. The director does well to give us the SAS raid viewed entirely through a spy satellite, however it would have been great if we knew more about those terrorist camps for example who is teaching who, what do they teach and what is their common cause? And again what really brings the movie down is the lack of political implications and rather illustrating how bad things are in Ireland, we have cartoon villains and the film's ending features a silly action scene on a boat. Overall 6.4/10.",Patriot Games

80,antagonist117,"The Jack Ryan we knew in ""Red October"" is replaced by a stereotype. The plot has flattened, too.",5,8 February 2014,"What makes Jack Ryan unique among action heroes? In ""The Hunt for Red October,"" his first appearance on screen, Alec Baldwin played him almost as an innocent, albeit a highly intelligent one. He was bright-eyed, often smiling, and joked privately to himself about the people he'd had to deal with. In the next two Ryan movies, Harrison Ford went in a different direction by giving the character Ford's own trademark scowl and seething brusqueness. Ford is entertaining enough in ""Patriot Games,"" and he can convey a lot with that scowl, or with a finger raised threateningly, but it must be admitted that a lot of action movies are helmed by characters much like his. And that's no surprise, because Ford himself played a lot of them. Compared to the strategic chess game of ""Red October,"" then, ""Patriot Games"" feels routine and even simple. Ryan's family, which includes his medical doctor wife (Anne Archer) and a daughter played by Thora Birch, a veritable acting prodigy for her young age, is targeted by a rogue IRA terrorist seeking vengeance for a perceived wrong. This personalized attack provokes Ryan to seek vengeance in return, and suddenly we have a vendetta movie that might as well star anyone other than CIA analyst Jack Ryan. The not-quite-IRA terrorists also hang around with some vaguely middle-eastern terrorists for no clear reason, which means that despite some over-the-top Irishness from the likes of Richard Harris the bad guys might as well be anybody, too. There may be something to the idea of using Ryan's family to illustrate the fact that terrorists in general, unlike Soviets or other more conventional enemies, intentionally and indiscriminately target civilians and families, but that's not really what's going on in ""Patriot Games."" Here it's specifically and exclusively Ryan's family members who are targets, and that's a far more lazy, manipulative way of generating stakes than the intricate plotting of ""Red October."" To be clear, ""Patriot Games"" is far from dislikable; it's an effective, even a good, mainstream thriller. It's just a bit disappointing to see Jack Ryan, our formerly wonky history teacher, turn into the kind of film character who goes around settling personal scores with his fists, his guns, and the occasional explosion.",Patriot Games
81,HelloTexas11,decent Clancy thriller,6,5 March 2008,"The second Tom Clancy novel made into a film ('The Hunt For Red October' being the first), 'Patriot Games' opts for a somewhat smaller scale. There's no chance World War III will result from anyone's actions here, but the CIA finds enough bad business coming from the Irish Republican Army to keep itself and those amazing spy satellites it employs busy. Harrison Ford is now Clancy's reliable hero, Jack Ryan, and Ford is a very good fit. In best Clancy fashion, Ryan is a very reluctant hero as well. He hates getting involved in other peoples' affairs and being forced to settle them, just as he hates being forced to kick ass, but what's an ex-Marine CIA agent to do? The villains this time are an ultraviolent faction of the IRA; Ryan gets on their bad side when he busts up an attempt by them to kill the British Home Secretary and his family. The rest of the movie is essentially a tit-for-tat series of confrontations between Ryan/CIA and these IRA murderers. The best scenes in 'Patriot Games' are the action ones, as well as the parts showing the CIA's supersecret and supersophisticated technology at work. Less successful are the scenes having to do with Ryan's home life, and his wife and daughter. There is an upper-class, peachy-keen smugness to them, exemplified by Anne Archer (Cathy Ryan) and her ""boy, this CIA stuff is a pain in the ass"" attitude. This type of material is not Clancy's strong suit (or the screenwriter's, apparently) and it shows. The trio of Irish baddies are all portrayed convincingly; Patrick Bergin, Polly Walker, and particularly Sean Bean in a menacing and venomous performance. 'Patriot Games' succeeds mainly because of Harrison Ford's tough, likable, and sometimes vulnerable presence. Several key plot points do not bear close scrutiny; it strikes one as unlikely the IRA and the CIA would take on one another over what is essentially a personal vendetta. But don't think too hard or too much and you'll find 'Patriot Games' a reasonably exciting thriller.",Patriot Games

83,dkncd,Lightweight thriller,6,16 August 2007,"""Patriot Games"" is the story of a terrorist seeking revenge for his brother's death based on the novel by Tom Clancy. Harrison Ford is Jack Ryan, the CIA analyst sought by terrorist Sean Miller, played by Sean Bean. Harrison Ford is the definitive Jack Ryan and brings more force to the role than Alec Baldwin or Ben Affleck. Sean Bean is also solid as Ryan's terrorist nemesis. The film had a notable supporting cast including James Earl Jones, Richard Harris, James Fox, Hugh Fraser and Samuel L. Jackson.The film is generally fast-paced and has some decent action sequences. It is interesting to see the technology used behind the scenes at the CIA. However, the film's primary weakness it its story. There is little story development beyond the ""terrorist seeking revenge"" premise and the characters are less interesting and developed than they could be. This makes ""Patriot Games"" is overall an average thriller, albeit with an outstanding cast. I'd recommend ""Clear and Present Danger"" (1994) instead of this for a Tom Clancy adaptation featuring Harrison Ford as Ryan because its story and characters are better developed.",Patriot Games

I am starting to actually enjoy the aesthetic; it's been so hard to get out that ingrained feeling that the 90s are 'lame' because i grew up in the 2000s, so everything from the decade previously was too recent to be vintage and all new fashion and aesthetic was a reaction against it. 80s and 70s were cool and retro, but it's been so hard for me to finally appreciate the 90s. I guess my favourite part about this movie was the fact that I was able to accomplish that moreso than anything about the movie but this is a good looking movie as well as being very engaging, an 'edge of your seat' type movie.

The Irish Republican Army are the bad guys who Harrison Fords character Jack Ryan thwarts in a terrorist attack. I am a non-violent person and do not like violence but there is a lot of it in the movie. As a CIA employee Admiral James Greer played by James Earl Jones is nearing retirement and about to say in American Intelligence parlance ""Old BOOS don't fade away they just sigh an aura."" I recently talked to a retired American Intelligence SPOOK who pointed out that America has more military bases than Canada and that I should feel free to visit American Military Bases. I saw quite a few American military bases while I was in the Canadian Forces during 10 years of service. I looked at the tennis court of my new American Intelligence friend and realized that American Intelligence Community employees are winners at the game of life. I wanted to be a winner too. Immediately after honourably retiring from the Canadian forces I began informing for the CIA. I joke that I am the Omega Wolf of the American Intelligence Community. Surprisingly you have more contact with Russian and Chinese people when they know that you are American Intelligence. I don't have to worry about accidentally giving away any Western Intelligence secrets because I don't know any. I have only been trained by the Canadian Forces to say Mousy Dung. In the 1950s the Chinese Communists thought the British were saying Mao Setung, only later did they realize that the British POWs had been saying an insult. I am always polite to them in case they choose to provide information or later decide to defect to the west. Yes the cold war ended in 1990 but as Author Michael Hamilton Morgan wrote there is a Twilight. My English friend Thompson was wounded by the IRA twice as an English soldier.

88,ary,efficient film,9,2 November 1998,"Patriot Games is an efficient film,that bets in the action scenes,all of them well- accomplished,and in the suspense.The story is involving,mostly because it touches in so genuine sentiments,like hate and revenge.Based on Tom Clancy's book,the film tells the story of Jack Ryan,an ex-CIA agent that,during his stay in the United Kingdom,witnesses an attempt against the royal family.Jack Ryan saves them,who would certainly be killed,but,in doing that,he kills the brother of one of the IRA's terrorists,Sean Miller(Sean Bean).Miller scapes,and begins to hunting Ryan's family,with the help of his two best friends,the characters of Patrick Bergin and Polly Walker.I certainlly think that this movie represents a good entertainment,without bigger compromises,that counts with a good script and an expensive production,directed with master-ship by Phillip Noyce,but I disagree with the choice of Harrison Ford for the leading character.He doesn't give,in my view,the image of a tough and implacable man,mostly when we see him in the first half - hour,over the bed,holding a bottle of champagne,talking to Anne Archer.Considering the hypothesis of re-casting the crew,if Laura Linney had done Polly Walker's role,things would be better.",Patriot Games

93,jillbeckinheim7,Love Clancy Films like this....,8,1 November 2021,"Love Clancy Films like this....the villain here is also nothing less than the President of the United States, a gutsy move, though by now this ""paternal villain"" cliché is getting old (""The Fugitive"", ""LA Confidential"", ""Monster's Inc"", ""Minority Report"" etc). Unusual for such films, ""Danger"" points out the immorality of affairs such as Irangate, doesn't salivate over the film's depiction of a secret war in South America (which Noyce links to Vietnam), considers (somewhat) the moral implications of violence, criticises snap emotive responses and deals with political betrayals and private agendas among both the President and his advisers. Where the film differs significantly from its 1970s predecessors, is it's total lack of impotency: the 90s spy-hero doesn't shy away from responsibility, and will go so far as to topple the Presidency to maintain the good of his countryWhat's funny, though, is that the film treats its central idea (the President mounting an illegal covert war in Panama) as a shockingly evil thing. In the real world, despite the fact that the American President is not allowed to deploy or instigate any military actions without Congress first declaring war, he routinely does so. Iraq, Vietnam, Korea etc, not to mention countless CIA instigated coups in places like Haiti, Iran, Chile and Ecuador, were all illegal by the Constitution of the United States. The fact is, Congress is always sidestepped, most recently in the ""bank bailout package"" fiasco.This being Tom Clancy, the main attraction is once again the gear on display: laser guided bombs, F18 hornets, sniper's hidden in the grass, an RPG attack on a convoy etc. From here, many computer game franchises would spawn, and from there, a banalization of military technology. People used to go to these thrillers and marvel at the hardware, gasping at the inside looks offered of the Oval Office and Pentagon, but now such things are routine, countless TV shows (West Wing, 24, The Unit, JAG) and video games (why be wowed by the sniper on screen, when you can BE him online) diluting the spectacle that made these films popular in the 90s.",Patriot Games
94,scorfield-51711,"""For service above and beyond the call of duty of a tourist, or even a Marine, we recognise Professor John Patrick Ryan, with the Order of the Purple Target.""",7,3 April 2021,"The second adaptation in the' Jack Ryan' franchise has received a critical backlash even from the original author himself. Indeed, Clancy disassociated himself from the project after reading the first script. Yet, Noyce and his screenwriters deserve credit for condensing the intricacies of the novel into, for the most part, such an engaging cinematic thriller.For this instalment, screenwriter Donald Stewart, who alone would work on all three Jack Ryan adaptations, was joined by W. Peter Iliff, who had penned the blockbuster action movie, 'Point Blank' the previous year. Clancy did not approve of the liberal changes made to his original content, especially the final action sequences. However, the combination of Noyce's direction and Donald MacAlpine's cinematography has produced a stylish mix of suspenseful espionage drama and well-choreographed action sequences.The movie also benefits greatly from the casting of Harrison Ford as Ryan, far more believable as a seasoned agent and reluctant hero than his predecessor. Baldwin probably overestimated the influence of his box office appeal to attempt to have the production of the movie fit around his other plans. Although, in an interview many years later, Baldwin gave an alternative explanation, stating that what had previously been circulated was the studio's fabrication, and that the truth behind the re-casting was that he was side-lined for the much more bankable star, whose other vehicle at the time had not been green-lit. Ironically, Ford had been approached and had turned down the role in Ryan's previous cinematic outing, feeling the character did not share enough of the limelight as that played by Sean Connery.The only actor to reprise their role from 'The Hunt for Red October' was James Earl Jones, and though both he and Ford are famously linked to the 'Star Wars' franchise, they had never appeared on screen together before, Jones adding Vader's voice in the editing suite.At the outset of this instalment, Ryan is on a mixture of business and family sightseeing in London - even their hotel room number, 713 , is a nod to our lead actor whose birthday is 7/13. The Ryan's' vacation is suddenly and violently interrupted when our protagonist valiantly intercedes to save the life of a member of the British royal family from the attack of an Irish extremist group. In doing so he shoots and kills the younger brother of this terrorist splinter group's firebrand, Sean Miller. The latter, played by Sean Bean, swears vengeance - though in an accent which slips more into a native of the Pennines than the Emerald Isle. In the source novel, Ryan rescues no less than Prince Charles and Lady Di, but here it is just the Queen Mother's fictional cousin, Lord William Holmes, the incumbent Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, played competently by James Fox, who replaced his brother Edward in the role. As an interesting historical footnote, the style of attack depicted bears striking similarity to the real attempt made to kidnap Princess Anne in March 1974 when her guard and driver were shot.Returning stateside, after attempts on both his life, and those of his wife and daughter, the whole machinery of US intelligence appears to be put at Ryan's dispensation to pay personal retribution on the extremist group. The film is gloriously scored by James Horner, who borrows liberally from his 'Aliens' soundtrack to add dramatic effect, to accompany the most memorable scene in the movie. This is the chilling real-time satellite feed of the liquidation of the terrorist camp in North Africa, the power of which to disquiet lies in the juxtaposition of the slaughter on the screen with the glib satisfaction of the CIA operative casually drinking coffee. Further mention should be made here of the clever use of Clannad's theme tune to 'Harry's Game' to add an appropriate haunting atmosphere to the attempted IRA hit on the head of this extremist splinter group of the republican cause, solidly played by Patrick Bergin.The talented supporting cast include the ever-reliable duo of James Earl Jones and Samuel Jackson, but, the stand-out performances are those of David Threlfall as the ill-fated Inspector Highland, and Richard Harris as the IRA spokesman determined to distance the organisation from the actions of Bergin's group. Threlfall's Inspector is in charge of both Miller's interrogation and transfer to prison, and when Miller's gang release him, is victim of a roadside execution, signing off with the memorable line: 'Get on with it and be on your way.' Harris' addition to the cast at the eleventh hour proves invaluable, and the name of his character, Paddy O'Neill, is taken from the name used by the IRA to sign all statements on their behalf: P. O'Neill. The film also marks the big breakthrough for Polly Walker, later more renowned for her role as Caesar's manipulative niece in the TV mini-series Rome. Here she portrays the unknown and merciless female assassin with red hair who becomes Ryan's central target in the search for the splinter terrorist group.In this instalment of the franchise, Ryan is presented as much more the family man, with Anne Archer replacing Gates McFadden as Ryan's wife, Dr Caroline 'Cathy' Ryan. McFadden had by the time of the shooting of this picture become a familiar face on TV screens, portraying Dr Beverly Crusher on 'Star Trek: The Next Generation'. In addition, there is the endearing appearance of the young Thora Birch as Ryan's daughter, who in the final scene of the movie, is asked if she has had enough, revealing an empty bowl of oatmeal, as a playful reference to the fact that the infant Birch used to appear in 'Quaker Oats' commercials.Within the film are the usual Hollywood 'short-cuts' with regards to portraying British and Irish relations accurately, although the film's willingness to broach the delicate issue of American fund-raising for Irish republican activities deserves to be applauded. Certainly, the film's depiction of the latter did not sit well with McTiernan, who had directed the first instalment, and led to his withdrawal from the project. With America having suffered so terribly at the hands of international terrorist organisations, it is interesting to note that the original trailers for this movie bore the tagline: 'There's never been a terrorist attack on American soil'. Wisely, this line was removed from the theatrical trailer release as it sounded too much like an invitation to anti-American terrorist groups.Avoiding lavish Bond-style set pieces aside, there are some convenient and slightly unrealistic, plot developments, but these do not detract from the entertainment value. The finale played out in Ryan's home is taut and exciting, with a 'nod' towards 'Silence of the Lambs' in heightening the tension for the audience by casting the action from the perspective of 'night-vision' as the terrorists seek out their targets in the pitch black. Perhaps, the finale should have been concluded here, rather than in the less enthralling speedboat sequence which follows. Not that Noyce should carry the blame for this, having to re-shoot the finale under pressure from the studio in response to lukewarm responses from preview audiences wishing for a more explosive ending. Whatever the reason, the aforementioned speedboat sequence led to Ford accidentally injuring Bean with a blow from a boat hook, the subsequent wound of which, enhanced by makeup, gave the Yorkshire actor his characteristic scar for portraying the Napoleonic hero, Sharpe.As for the director, Philip Noyce, he continued his trajectory of handling action movies with great aplomb, and together with the next instalment, would enjoy great box office success. As for Ford, this gave him another franchise character which would ensure his box-office longevity and consolidate his place in the hallowed halls of memorable action-heroes.",Patriot Games
95,Ryan_9,Decent movie but could've been better,6,22 May 2020,"""Patriot Games"" was a decent movie. It starred Harrison Ford, who played Jack Ryan, a former CIA agent, who stops an IRA terrorist attack and kills one of the men. Thus, Sean Miller (Sean Bean), the brother of the guy that died seeks revenge as he tracks down Jack's family and nearly kills them. These actions lead to Jack rejoining the CIA, so he can stop Miller and the rest of the IRA.The action and suspense were very good but the movie itself could've been better. The first half was boring and slow. It only started to pick up about 55 minutes in. Though, once it picked up things got interesting. I also would've liked to have seen more of Robby, played by Samuel L. Jackson, he was cool. I was relieved that Jack's family didn't die as that would've been very sad. I was glad that Jack got revenge by impaling Sean on an anchor, killing him.Overall, I'll give ""Patriot Games"" a 6/10. Not a bad movie, just very average.",Patriot Games
96,npdeo18,Turns out to be more of personal Action Thriller.,7,4 June 2021,"Patriot Games is based on the famous novel of the same name written by Tom Clancy & is the sequel to 1990 film, The Hunt for the Red October in which the character of Jack Ryan is the principal protagonist and was portrayed by Alec Baldwin. In this however, Alec Baldwin is replaced by Harrison Ford.The plot involves a PIRA terrorist's attempts to murder Ryan for killing his brother as well foiling the assassination of a influential member of Royal Family. The rest of the film showcases whether Ryan is able to thwart the assassination attempts on him & his family with help of CIA.Before analyzing i would like to mention that despite being on my wish list I have not read the novels of this series.When I saw Patriot Games & when I compare it with it's prequel, The Hunt for Red October, I felt this film to be more of a family action thriller (like Firewall or Air Force One), than being a conventional spy thriller like it's prequel. Despite all these drawbacks I found the film to be entertaining, akin to the action films of it's time with it's action scenes to the highlights of the film.In term of performance i would rate the performance of Harrison Ford, Sean Bean & Anne Archer as the highlight of the film. With Harrison Ford enacting his role in saving his family and members of Royal family very well (I don't think Ford would have portrayed the same role in it's prequel with such finesse as I thought Baldwin to be better in that role) , while Sean Bean was menacing and ruthless as a villain who is hell bent on destroying Ryan, in fact I would describe his performance better than Ford's. Anne Archer enacted her role well as a supporting wife of Ryan especially when she supports her husband to join CIA after her initial inhibition. But I was disappointed with James Earl Jones's role as Ryan's boss as when compared to it's prequel his presence in this film was pretty miniscule in nature.On the whole it's not on par with it's original, but for the lovers of action films this is an entertaining and is a good way to spend 120 minutes along with a bowl of popcorn.",Patriot Games
97,Progressive-Element,"Decent thriller, arguably better than the book",7,26 May 2013,"Tom Clancy's novel is actually set before The Hunt for Red October, showing how he came to be in the CIA. While it makes for entertaining reading, there are moments of unintentional hilarity that really spoil it when it comes to passages involving the Royal Family.This film, set after The Hunt for Red October - a necessity with the older Harrison Ford playing Jack Ryan - has it's moments of silliness. Some serious off-key location shooting for scenes in Britain provide amusement, particularly a scene clear showing the Transporter Bridge in Middlesbrough which I've seen up close and personal. Rather out of the way considering Sean Bean's character was being transported from London to the Isle of Wight... Then there are the usual national archetypes.While the film does cop out a bit by inventing a Royal Family member for the bad guys to target, and doing away with the black militants in the book who help out the bad guys, on it's own terms, it manages to be an effective thriller, with some standout moments that will have your heart in your throat. The best part of the film depicts an SAS raid, as seen by infrared satellite, and we see some of the CIA guys not even bat an eyelid, giving dry commentary while watching real people being killed on live transmission. The climactic boat chase maybe more appropriate for a Hollywood action film than a Tom Clancy thriller, it does get the blood pumping.",Patriot Games
98,neil_mc,"""The IRA's not stupid"" - a point seemingly disproved here",7,26 May 2003,"In the interests of political correctness, the makers of this film decide to have the 'bad guys' not as the IRA themselves but as a breakaway group led by the insane Sean Bean. This is surely just to keep the film from any controversy whilst we are repeatedly told the IRA is the innocent party and has nothing to do with any of the attacks. Some reviews on this page suggest that the Irish attitudes and depictions in this film are prejudiced and unfair. Yeah, good one.Getting off politics, I had rather hoped Samuel L Jackson would play a larger role. One of the reasons I watched the film was because of his presence but you could count his scenes on one hand. I suppose he wasn't as big in 1992 as he is now, still playing minor supporting roles such as Stacks in Goodfellas and not yet hitting Pulp Fiction fame. The action in the film was great and kept you on the edge of your seat. I was cheering on Harrison Ford as the American CIA hero as the Irish fell one by one via shoot outs and boat chases. The action sequences were well directed and the film highly enjoyable. 7/10",Patriot Games

Yeah right, a totally believable story line - NOT! The odds must be in the billions. A film like Die Hard can get away with this sort of nonsense because it is a ""semi tongue-in-cheek"" action movie; Patriot Games takes itself far too seriously for it to get away with such a ridiculous plot contrivance.

Ryan,"Good, but not as good as Hunt for Red October.",7,2 April 1999,"I've always seen Jack Ryan as a revisionist Bond, what Ian Fleming would have written had he been ... well ..  more American and less campy.Ryan is a patriot and family, and to that extent Harrison Ford does the character credit.  However, something felt lost in the transition. Obviously Paramount thought Ford would draw a larger box office, and Ford does have more screen presence than Baldwin.  However, while Jack Ryan was a little naive, eager, intelligent and sarcastic in Hunt for Red October, Ford just seems to be monotonously brooding throughout most of Patriot Games.Granted, Clancy's book needed some major rework before transitioning to film.  Donald Stewart adapted the novel wonderfully until the last 5 minutes.  Perhaps my expectations were a little too high, but a fist fight on a power boat in the middle of Chesapeake Bay is a little hackneyed.Overall, the film is still good, definitely outranking the calibre of traditional Hollywood explosion-thons.  Patriot Games will actually engage you in an engrossing story.  I just wish Baldwin and director John McTiernan had agreed to return.  Phillip Noyce just does not understand pacing or continuity.",Patriot Games
103,DomiMMHS,Just well done!,8,12 February 1999,"This one is no milestone movie, but it's very enjoyable. After having watched it twice, I taped it the third time. It's maybe the most enjoyable political thriller there is - not my favorite genre after all. Not an action fan after all, I guess I even like the action in this movie. It fits. It is not only action, you also have to think, some intelligence is required to understand the plot. But it's not too complicated or too realistic either. It's a good story managing to build up great suspense and to deserve the rating ""well-done, intelligent thriller""(8 out of 10).OK, there is something special about the movie - concerning the way Jack Ryan's (Harrison Ford) family is involved in the conflict. Commonly, when family matters and emotions are shown in movies they get so kitschy that it really hurts. Not so here. Instead this fake sentimental attitude towards family matters is made a subject in a few dialogues here. The Polly Walker character says something like ""The Americans hold their breath when a little girl sprains her ankles in P.E. lessons"" and Jack Ryan says (roughly)""Do you want me to give the media what they want? Let their camera teams into my daughter's hospital room?"". That's the truth. In ""Patriot Games"" these emotions are acted out very unobtrusively, yet with no doubt touching and believeable.It is not the main point of the movie, which IS an action thriller, but I think it's quite honorable.Harrison Ford, as the main character, is a very believeable actor. Cast him and a movie that can't be perfect will be as good as it can get. Sean Bean makes a great psycho - there seem to be actors who are born for roles like this, he may be one. And now I have to make references to other movies: Thora Birch, who plays Ryan's daughter is a brilliant talent - I recommend you the movie ""Paradise"" in order to convince yourself. Always good to see her in a bit part. And James Fox is good as a likeable royal snob here and in order to conclude what a great actor he is - consider that this is the same actor as the wonderful villain in 1996's ""Gulliver's Travels"".",Patriot Games
104,Twilight_Wraith,Very Intense and fascinating thriller,10,17 March 2003,"Of all the books that were made into movies from Tom Clancy novels, this is the best. Harrison Fords portrayal of Jack Ryan is absolutely excellent. Unlike the movies he has been in in the past 5 years, he actually emotes in this one. His acting is absolutely top notch. Anne Archer does a very good job playing Jack Ryan's wife, Cathy Ryan. Jack Ryan runs into trouble when saving some people from a terrorist attack, kills the brother of IRA terrorist Sean Miller, portrayed with frightening accuracy and intensity by Sean Bean.Unfortunately, Jack Ryan did not Realize that Sean Miller would come after him and his family for revenge. Thus ensues a very tense and emotional battle of wills and physical strenth. Sean Miller, whose motives are not those of the IRA. Throughout the movie Sean Miller takes his terrorist buddies out and tries to kill Jacks family with their aid. What we've got here is a fascinating and intense political thriller. Even better, the supporting actors do a great job of rounding off the cast of this terrific movie.

105,doug1717,What a Bad Film,2,9 March 2008,"Harrison Ford is dry and stiff as an actor in this film. Han Solo just can't cut it here. His over the top anger, his blank ""it's not my fault!"" emotion and even his raised finger to Richard Harris aren't enough to make him watchable or acceptable as Jack Ryan. Also Anne Archer comes off as a pompous snob. Thora Birch is cute as the daughter. The only good actors who do well here are James Earl Jones, and Alan Armstrong, and it was nice to see ""Shameless""'s Frank Gallagher (David Threfall). I don't know if Alec Baldwin and Gates McFadden would have been better, but I suspect so. Ford and Archer were purely names to help sell a film franchise. Sean Bean once again reprises his lunatic killer role and the film's plot makes about as much sense as his character does. Miller takes care of his compatriots just to take a shot at a fleeing Jack Ryan. A very poorly executed film that had a lot of potential and a ready following from the books.

106,ksundstrom,Entertaining CIA mythology,8,4 October 2005,"Harrison Ford, retired CIA active analyst of importance, is walking like any tourist to see Buckingham Palace. Innocently with wife and child. Suddenly, he's yanked back into the terrorist world of shots and explosions as IRA gunmen try to assassinate a royal personage who is responsible for Britain's political role in North Ireland. The Lord is driving out from his office block when all hell breaks loose and Ford throws himself forward into the action. A brother of a fanatical IRA assassin is killed, demanding blood vengeance. The action of vengeance never stops from then on. The IRA's skill in getting prisoners free, brutal execution of any who disagree within the IRA radicals, Libyia's active support to the IRA in the form of desert training camps, the IRA underground network, including upper-class moles and even timid bookworms in classy commercial malls all add spice. Bitter spice is also added in the form of CIA super technological superiority in the world of agents, satellites and counter terrorist offensives: bitter, as the CIA is always great on film but sadly falls short of solid and comprehensive results in the real world of significant undercover actions against foreign powers and international terrorism. Earl Jones as the CIA boss for counter terrorism superbly reflects, deadpan of course, the CIA's dilemma of having to chose masterful technological efficiency rather than demanding more skilled manpower on the ground. So it is left to the man on the ground to save himself and his family. Harrison Ford does this very convincingly with great entertainment value.",Patriot Games
107,Leonidos,good until the end,6,4 December 2000,I would probably have liked this better if I had never read the book.  I first got interested in Clancy after I saw the movie Clear and Present Danger.  Both Clear and Present and The Hunt for Red October are excellent adaptations and include as much as realistically possible considering the length of the books.Patriot Games was good and very loyal to the original story until the end. Since I had already read the book I absolutely HATED the ending.  It was fine as a stand alone but it was completely different from the book's ending.  I wouldn't have minded them changing the ending except the book's was MUCH better and could have been used as is just as easily.  Instead the filmmakers obviously didn't like how Jack Ryan handled the terrorists in the final confrontation and decided to monkey with things- badly.  Despite that still a fairly good thriller.,Patriot Games
108,saykeng,The Power of Observation & Juxtaposition...obviously requisite character traits of a CIA analyst!,8,12 August 2006,"I have never read any of Tom Clancy's works, but I have seen all the movies made from them. Patriot Games is one of them.The storyline is quite simple: Jack Ryan (Harrison Ford), former CIA analyst, is on vacation/lecture tour in England with his family. While on the way to meet them near Buckingham Palace, he & his family are caught in a cross-fire during an assassination attempt on a member of the Royal Family, Lord Holmes (Edward Fox), by a rogue faction of the IRA led by Sean Miller (Sean Bean). In the ensuing shoot-out, Jack killed one the terrorists, who happens to be Sean's younger brother. Jack gets drawn back into the CIA after the terrorists set out a vengeful attack against his family back in USA.In my view, the action sequences in this movie are not very exciting, when compared with any of the recent Bond &/or Bourne movies, although the entire movie is quite entertaining. I particularly enjoyed the sequence showing a real-time satellite-tracking session at CIA HQ, during which Jack & his counter-terrorism team are watching a crack SAS team conducting a black ops raid at the terrorists' hideout somewhere in Libya. The accompanying music score is realistically haunting! What excites me most about this movie is watching Jack exercising his astute power of observation & his uncanny ability to juxtapose images in a relentless attempt to track down the whereabout of the rogue faction of the IRA,...with the high-tech resources of CIA's counter-terrorism group, of course.Using vital information secured from Paddy O'Neil (Richard Harris), an IRA supporter in the USA, Jack narrows down the search through his observation/juxtaposition of CIA's satellite images (which includes an overhead snapshot of an apparently capped woman with a pony tail) with his own recalled images: - a back-view glimpse of the pony-tailed driver in the terrorists' getaway vehicle during the foiled assassination attempt in England; - a side-view glance of the pony-tailed driver in the terrorists' getaway vehicle during an unsuccessful assassination attempt on his life outside the US Naval Academy; All these associations have been triggered while taking a break & walking pass a pony-tailed woman employee on the way to answer the call of nature at CIA Headquarters.What a brilliant piece of detective work - observation plus juxtaposition - on the part of Jack! The Power of Observation & Juxtaposition are obviously requisite character traits of a CIA analyst.In summing up this review, I have enjoyed very much watching Patriot Games, experientially as well as educationally. This is another wonderful addition to my resource repertoire.",Patriot Games

I don't think this movie was intended to be innovative, to be great, to be memorable.  What it was intended to be was entertaining, and it lived up to this expectation.Harrison Ford is the master of remaining as low-key as possible.  He has had so many films where he can over-emphasize, over-dramatize, and simply over-act.  Ford has the maturity to keep this from happening, and he does so again in this film.  Ford is supported quite well with such actors/actresses as James Earl Jones (reprising his role as Greer from The Hunt for Red October), Samuel L. Jackson, and Anne Archer.  For an action flick, acting is much above average.It was also suspenseful...thrilling.  I thought the ending had a nice build-up and climax.  I realize this is different from the book's ending...but remember, these are two different visions...not the same one. This brings up a big point in movie-watching:  Comparing a movie to a book is the worst thing you can do.  They are two completely different genres. More importantly, as I said before, they are two different visions.I'm not a big action fan.  I used to be, but anymore most stories are the same.  To this end I would say Patriot Games is fairly mainstream. However, it was always fun to watch and sometimes thrilling to watch.  I'm also not a big Tom Clancy fan, but I've given the movies based off his books a shot because again they are different visions.  The result is (at least with Patriot Games) a good film to watch on a Saturday night with a bowl of popcorn.  Don't expect great things, but don't expect to be disappointed, either.Rating:  7/10",Patriot Games
113,mgm-2,Having a star actor detracts from the story,5,13 January 1999,"I enjoyed the first half of this film but if I hadn't read the book before watching this film I'd have been disappointed that the last half hour seems to consist of a bunch of people aimlessly banging about in a dark house. This was truly awful to watch.Having read the book, the fact that every scene seems to have been written around Harrison Ford is very irritating. Tasks accomplished by teams of people in both the book and in real life are solely done by Jack Ryan. An important character in the book but not the only one.Having said that, Harrison Ford does as good a job as anyone could have in portraying Jack Ryan. The actress playing his young daughter is wonderful but the wife character doesn't ring true somehow.",Patriot Games
114,clintcarter-28550,Weakest of the Early 90's Trilogy,5,25 February 2020,"Good action scenes, more focus on Jack, and Harrison Ford was an improvement over Alec Baldwin. But with it being so personal between Jack and Sean it lacked the political intrigue of most Tom Clancy works. Plus the entire plot hinges on Jack remembering seeing a woman in a car for a split second during intense action.",Patriot Games
115,GundersonRocks,Very Nice,9,6 November 2006,"I have both read the novel and seen the film, and though Tom Clancy fans will probably be after my blood, the film is probably better. Tom Clancy distanced himself from the film due to some plot twists, but I personally think that the movie flows very well. The acting is great! Harrison Ford has always been a favorite of mine, and Sean Bean was once again perfectly convincing as the villain. I think that the entire movie was worthwhile. Despite the ""R"" rating for the film, it is not very graphic. The rating is probably from a certain sexual scene and the intensity of the violence. My only real complaint is that the final action scene, although fun, was a bit unrealistic. All in all, a great film.My Rating:9 out of 10 stars",Patriot Games
116,sexy_fouchet,"""Patriot Games"" - Sean Bean = waste of time",2,9 November 2002,"this film was so boring that i can't even remember half(more than half) of it.i could barely follow the plot with sexy Sean Bean as an IRA terrorist,and so after he was killed i stopped watching.i am a great fan of Sam Jackson and James Earl Jones,but i don't like Ford and Walker,so there's the balance.without Sean this would be a complete waste of time!anyway,i gave this film 2/10,and only because of Sean,for being so sexy!",Patriot Games
117,imdbman-8,cheap,2,30 July 2007,"one of the cheapest propaganda films of Hollywood. simply rubbish. for the people who eats hamburger while watching such films and needless to say that not thinking, just looking without seeing. a small, cute girl with her pregnant mother, doctors, hospitals, terrorists in europa but immediately appearing somewhere ""asia"", and surely a CIA hero. in addition, ""fighting in the rain."" saves his country and family... sir CIA agent???

118,nedhall99,As an Annapolitan - and Clancy fan - well...,8,3 February 2010,"...this movie was great! Nothing much to add, but anytime I like the movie version of a good book, well that works for me. Harrison Ford just ""fits"" as Clancy's ever-recurring reluctant hero. Gotta say I liked Red October better, but that was cause of Sean Connery as well...but Ford would have made a good Ryan in that too - no knock at Baldwin. I like the way James Earl Jones plays Greer, with that slightly bemused smirk as he tries to filter through all the political BS (though not as much in this). Anyway a good movie - and one that a non-reader of the book can easily follow as well.Seeing those old clunky state-of-the-art at the time car cell phones (wired, no less) is a minus, but lots of movies from this period are the same. I hope this is not a spoiler...but this is not a typical Jack Ryan Clancy novel, that is with the U.S. embroiled in something close to what might be seen on today's 24, this movie is really about the Ryan family, I will leave it at that.",Patriot Games
119,tyler-bruce23,Great Film,10,31 January 2012,"OK, so it has some plot holes, and I generally spend a good amount of time detailing for my husband the deviations from the novel (which are many, since Hollywood doesn't make many five-hour movies). And it's predictable and artless and has plenty of clichés. I make it a point not to read IMDb reviews for a movie until after I've written my own, but even so I can guess that this one has been torn apart on these points probably at least a dozen times. Now that that's over with, I'm going to admit that I like this movie. It feels like a tight thriller, good for those nights when I want entertainment with some minor complexity. I like to ""go along for the ride"", so to speak, even though I know how it ends. And going back to the first time I saw this, before I'd read the book, I remember being on the edge of my seat quite a bit.Thora Birch does this film a lot of good. Her expressions and lines are quite well-acted, and she's cute without being syrupy. Harrison Ford is Harrison Ford; you either like him or you don't, and this movie isn't going to change your mind (I happen to like him).Don't go renting this one if you want an artsy movie, or a beautiful movie, or a movie with a perfectly tight script. But if you can enjoy a film for simple entertainment value, and you like Harrison Ford ;), this is a good one for after the kids are in bed.",Patriot Games
120,crystal1-317-832009,Loved Harrisoin in this,7,17 March 2012,"This is an outstanding thriller, a movie I have always enjoyed watching since it came out. Apparently a number of people also did since a few sequels followed featuring the main character ex-CIA analyst ""Jack Ryan,"" played by Harrison Ford.Sean Bean was excellent as the revenge-obsessed villain, a member of a ""splinter group,"" as its labeled not really an IRA extremist, but one too out-of- control for any group. Ford is the man best able to stop him and the film is very interesting start-to-finish and smart enough not to overdo the violence. Suspenseful is probably the best word to describe the movie as Bean goes after Ford's family.Anne Archer, as Ford's wife, along with the rest of the cast, actors such as Patrick Bergen, James Earl Jones, James Fox, Richard Harris and a young Thora Birch make this a well- acted movie.This is simply one of the best thrillers I've ever seen and almost every scene is interesting.",Patriot Games
121,lawstudent-3,Best Philip Noyce film,10,14 December 2006,"This brought action to a new level. Tremendous film. Great revenge thriller - loved the beginning sequence. Ann Archer is always great. Loved when Harrison sees his wife's car wreck. Perfect film to watch on a Friday night. I don't know why Clancy's movies came down after this. The last Clancy film was terrible. We need more spy thrillers today. Spy Game was horrible, but this rocked. Would definitely recommend this to anyone. See Patriot Games and see what great film-making is no longer about Kudos to Noyce! He should direct all the thrillers. Another great thriller is 'The Genius Club' which opened in Dallas last month. Great film, too.",Patriot Games
122,Alex P,Run of the mill,5,9 May 1999,"A fairly ordinary film. There's nothing much remarkable about it, except for the bizarre way the Irish and British are portrayed (almost amusing at times - for example how a member of the Royal family is also the Northern Ireland minister!!). There is a lot of action, and Ford has always been good at that stuff. However, the real stars are Sean Bean and Richard Harris, who rise above the poor script - also true for the ever-excellent James Earl Jones.",Patriot Games
123,Skeefers,Good movie.,9,7 April 2000,"Very good movie, well done.  The book is easier to read than the movie is to watch, but its still a good attention keeper.  It uses lots of good camera angles, my favorite being the spy camera under the door into the IRA occupied room, and the spy camera in the light in the bookstore.",Patriot Games

125,willfairfield-15632,Outstanding on 4k blu ray,10,17 February 2021,"Just watched the 4k new master looks like it was filmed yesterday.As a movie in isolation I dont think it is realistic in terms of historically accuracy, the IRA campaign was deadly widespread and extensive in Ireland / Britain but as far as I know did not spill over into the USA.What is realistic is the movie in context in as much as some movies are pro IRA propaganda, this is anti IRA propaganda portraying the IRA as crazy and that in itself has a certain realism of the propaganda war at the time this movie was made.I think the movie would've been more menacing if the IRA Sean Bean character was less crazy and equally ruthless, but as it is , the improbability of his character to some extent makes it more watchable, less heavy and more thrilling.Most of all, I've seen this movie before and not appreciated it until seeing the 4k release which looks outstanding.",Patriot Games
126,Ramzi_Nohra2020,ok for a mindless thriller,5,17 December 2020,"Mix of cartoon politics and one-dimensional characters. There are some good action sequences although actually he occludes some of the action which is found in the book around the rescue and the final assault on the house.
Re: the other reviewers highlighting the protagonists as being a rogue faction as somehow being a nod to Irish America - this was one of the few signs of realism on behalf of Clancy - he knew there was no way the mainstream IRA would have launched these attacks in America.

127,cgrantwilts,Did anyone else know,7,3 April 2006,"I found out the other day that the SF raid shown in this film by satellite seems to be based on an actual raid by Delta Force in the early 80's, apparently it was its first successful mission after the bodge up of Op Eagle Claw. Cant remember the book title, but it was all about elite forces etc, and was briefly mentioned in the bit on American SF. Anyone else heard about this? I personally loved this scene, i remember at first i was hoping for something a bit more action film like, but then, that is such a cliché! The cold hearted satisfaction of ""that is a...kill!"" as a throat os cut, and Fords horror as he realises what he is watching... Makes u think how often stuff like this happens...",Patriot Games
128,corporacavernosa,Very intense!,7,26 October 2006,"This movie is 14 years old yet holds its own by today's action standards. It's always a nice visit to go back to the movie making days before CG. While present day action films are nonstop, in-your- face while being heavy on effects and low on plot, you don't get that here. I like Alec Baldwin, but I'm glad he turned down the Jack Ryan role for a Broadway play. Harrison Ford is so convincing you share in his anguish and pain. Too bad he chose not to take up the role again for ""Sum of All Fears"". Ben Affleck as Jack Ryan? Give me a break! The lovely and talented Anne Archer is equally impressive. Great work from the Australian director Phillip Noyce. Can't wait to see ""Catch a Fire"". I would have given it an 8, but the Sean Miller character was written as being too over-the-top.",Patriot Games
129,pamtnman,Solid and intriguing entertainment,10,17 June 2019,"Patriot Games combines real life issues and places (of its time, back in the late 1980s) with Hollywood entertainment very well. It has lots of realistic action, wholesome family life, depictions of the US government actually working for The People, all good stuff. One modern edit intrigues me. In the original release, Ryan sees the female terrorista sitting on a chair in one of the satellite photos, and he said ""Jugs!"" Fast forward to what is being shown on Netflix today and in the same scene Ryan says ""T*ts!"" Why someone went through the trouble to make this edit is anyone's guess. It does not appreciably diminish the movie, but I wonder if it is a sign of the PC times",Patriot Games

Being a huge Tom Clancy fan, i've read the book several times over, and the only thing this movie has in common with the book is the names of the characters. Cathy Ryan is blonde, not a red head. along with other inconsistencies with the book. One day i'll figure out why author's let their works get butchered by the demons of Hollywood. A great novel destroyed. The only redeeming quality of this movie adaptation is that they found a good actor to play Jack Ryan.

Ford's portrayal as the brave, yet feeling Sir John Patrick Ryan is one that makes any reader of the books by Tom Clancy imagine that Ford really is Jack Ryan, and vice versa.The movie's plot, while not exactly following the book's plot is a testament to its writers.  Although Clancy's ending had more action, it would have been difficult to bring to climax on film. But don't fear, the movie is an excellent portrayal of what can happen when Terrorists tick-off people like Jack Ryan!",Patriot Games
133,aarrkk-2,Worst use of a Porsche in a Movie - but still a 7 out of 10 movie,7,21 June 2009,"Worst use of a Porsche in a Movie and maybe also worse use of a strong successful competent female character - as opposed to ""Le Mans"" (1971), which is the best use of a Porsche in a Movie Also ""LeMans"" has some strong performances for the women -- but don't expect there to be any ""Danica Patrick"" roles in that 1971 movie, just girlfriends and wives needed to apply. The Ann Archer's character in ""Patriot Games"" seems not to be dealing with a glass ceiling but a plate glass box, on the other hand. Although there could have been an exciting car stunt with the Porsche driven by Archer being hunted on the freeway by the IRA in a F-250 Econoline van - the Ford should not have been allowed to overtake the Porsche once the game was afoot. Road and Track has noted a 0-60 MPH time of 5.4 seconds for this the Targa Porsche Carrera 2. I don't think any van could do that, including Mr. T's - even though it could certainly vainly spin its tires for that long. The Ford van has at best the optional 200 HP 5.8L V8, but over 30 lbs to push with those few ponies whereas the Porcshe has 247 HP and at most 19 lbs. per horse power - these numbers are conservative on weight with the advantage given to the van (which if it was a rental should have had the standard 150 HP 4.8L).I think this whole scene was a missed opportunity for more drama and excitement.",Patriot Games

I feel that the incident in England, the way it happened in the book is much more exciting and entertaining than the movie and it carries over to the gathering at the Ryan's home later in the movie and the ending in the book is even more dramatic. But, after watching the movie a few more times and reading the book several more times I realized that because there is so much that happens in the book, there is no way to fit it in the movie. I have come to the conclusion that the story line in the movie has captured the basic tale involved showing the type of person Jack Ryan is and the principals that he stands for throughout all of Tom Clancy's books.",Patriot Games

140,kristynbrown,Harrison Ford at his best!,8,13 October 2005,"Whether you're Irish, English, American, or just a big fan of Harrison Ford or Sean Bean, this film is a must-see! Harrison was a perfect fit for this family man, reluctant hero role. He's no super-action hero or martyr, just a man in the wrong place at the wrong time trying to protect his family and prevent the slaughter of innocents. But when the terrorists seek revenge by targeting his family, Jack Ryan is forced to use any means necessary to keep his loved ones safe. Sean Bean plays a convincing villain as usual, donning a convincing Irish accent and his signature sinister expression. His performance was one of his best to date and kudos to Mr. Bean for creating a villain with whom we can sympathize. Anne Archer's character is weak however, typical damsel-in-distress wife and mother relying completely on her husband for protection and having no self-defense skills whatsoever. Thora Birch is adorable in her pre-pubescent innocence. Samuel Jackson as usual does little to step out of his smooth-talking, sarcastic typecast and again plays the same character he plays in every film to date. The film bounces between edge-of-your-seat thriller and slow-moving CIA analysis, but the scenes of action and the superb acting of Harrison Ford more than make up for any slow parts.",Patriot Games
