0,Leofwine_draca,Does for adultery what JAWS did for sharks,6,25 July 2011,"So here we have it, the granddaddy of the psycho-thriller genre and in all respects a more subtle and realistic film than you'd expect from a genre that later descended into cheesy madness and inanity. By the time these run of films had finished – and there are still some B-movies coming out, here and there – we'd had psychotic babysitters, mothers, fathers, children, nurses, co-workers, you name it. But FATAL ATTRACTION is the one that kicked them all off in a wave of popularity, even if there were precedents in the likes of Eastwood's PLAY MISTY FOR ME and the slasher genre. It's a simple story of the archetypal happy family and what happens when the father and husband has an affair with an unhinged woman.Michael Douglas is on top form as the slightly sleazy family guy who can't resist shacking up with loopy Glenn Close when his wife (Anne Archer) is away. Douglas later found a home in this type of film, menaced by more adulteresses (Sharon Stone) and even his own boss (Demi Moore). Here, though, he's fresher faced and more realistic, with the script making no bones of his adultery and the way he betrays both his wife and child by having an affair while they're away. Glenn Close is frightening in the role that made her name, but I have to say she doesn't cut it as an object of desire – with that hairstyle she looks like a maniac from the outset! The realism of the plot excludes the kind of murderous rampage sequences that later popularised the genre, and it's all the more chilling for it – the suicide attempt scene is far more disturbing than watching a madwoman running amok with a kitchen knife. Then, of course, there's that scene involving the favourite family pet that's rightly gone down in history as one of the most memorable of all time, and a now-familiar shock climax to polish things off. I did find the film somewhat subdued in places where it could have been more thrilling, but that's because it plays it as a character drama for the most part, more interested in getting to grips with Close's psychosis than bumping off a string of inconsequential types.",Fatal Attraction
1,SnoopyStyle,Boil Bunny Boil!!!,6,10 July 2015,"Dan Gallagher (Michael Douglas) is happily married to Beth (Anne Archer) with daughter Ellen. He's a NYC lawyer with a publisher client. He gets close to editor Alex Forrest (Glenn Close) and starts an affair with her while his family is away. He tries to distance himself and she attempts suicide. She won't let go and tells him that she's pregnant.Dan is a douche bag. On one hand, I'm glad that his affair isn't soft peddled. On the other hand, I'm not invested in his well being. I don't care whether Beth finds out or not. I don't care whether Alex is really pregnant or not. I don't care whether Dan lives or dies. I barely care about the kid. I would be perfectly happy if Dan and Beth get divorced. I actually wish his life falls apart completely.There is no doubt that the performances are great especially Glenn Close. The frenetic action scenes are exciting. The direction styles of Adrian Lyne looks beautiful. There is a quiet intensity about the movie. I just wish I care more about Dan. Honestly he's a real douche.",Fatal Attraction
2,Prismark10,Fatal Attraction,8,11 April 2021,"In 1987 Fatal Attraction was credited for making men in America to think twice before committing adultery.Men were scared in case their one night stand might end up being a bunny boiler like Alex Forrest (Glenn Close.)This erotic thriller is inspired by Clint Eastwood's directorial debut Play Misty For Me.Dan Gallagher (Michael Douglas) is a successful lawyer who has a publisher for a client for his law firm.Alex Forrest is one of the editors working for the publishing company. Dan first met Alex at a book party where she gave his colleague a deadly look.Later Dan and Alex have a drink after a business meeting. It quickly develops to a passionate encounter while Dan's wife and young daughter is away.To Dan this is just a harmless fling. Alex is upset that she is so casually discarded. She quickly sends Dan's life into turmoil by phoning him at the office and then his home. She later tells Dan that she is pregnant.Soon Alex starts to stalk Dan and his family, her actions becoming more disturbing.Some people felt sympathy for Alex Forrest as the woman left behind. To me it was obvious that she had some kind of mental disorder. It was something not discussed in the context of the movie.Director Adrian Lyne has made a fast moving thriller. At first he goes for steamy eroticism that soon develops into obsessive behaviour on Alex's part.Lyne hits the sweet spot with the bunny scene. The reshot ending owes a debt to Psycho and it also includes what soon became fashionable, the double killing of the baddie.The best performance is from Glenn Close. This was a risque role that she had not played up to now. An older sexy and dominant career woman but someone who was also unhinged.Fatal Attraction was a big success at the box office when released in 1987. To some it was seen as a parable for Aids. That there is no such thing as safe sex.",Fatal Attraction
3,mark.waltz,The saga of a scorned woman.,8,11 March 2017,"Whether it be ""Play Misty For Me"", ""Once You Kiss a Stranger"" or the dozens of other nightmares about the other woman, it's a fascinating warning to the errant husband or the horny bachelor. Happily married Michael Douglas lives a seemingly picture perfect existence with the practically perfect Anne Archer and their young child. But her sudden departure to visit family brings on temptation in the form of a business associate, the alluring Glenn Close who may not be a ravishing beauty, bit exudes sexuality in a way that is dangerous and predatory. After snubbing Douglas's colleague, she lightly flirts with Douglas, and soon lures his fly into her web. He finds himself like any classic film noir anti-hero paralyzed by her spider sting, one that leads to incredible passion, but has a slow acting poison that strikes much later, psychologically, threatening to destroy his entire world.There are two views of women here, from the perfect wife and mother to the vamp, the vixen, the femme fatale, and Glenn Close is every inch each of those that Stanwyck, Bennett, Greer and Savage were in the 1940's. She's sassy, class with trash (that perm alone gives her away), and will not take no for an answer. Threatened with being the perfect wife and mother in previous films, Glenn Close forever altered her image with this part. She outdid herself with ""Dangerous Liaisons"" and ""101 Dalmatians"", and I can see why she entered immortality through these parts, leading her to be cast as Norma Desmond in the original Broadway production of ""Sunset Boulevard"", recently revived with her perfecting the legendary part.Douglas gets sympathy for becoming her victim, reacting to her every scheme and manipulation with initial shock, and later horror, anger and revenge. This gives the good wife Anne Archer many different dimensions, and she is quite formidable when dealing with the attack on her family. Yes, there are elements of exploitation here, as well as a few camp elements, but the fun of the film is that you never know what will happen. I'm not entirely thrilled with the dramatic conclusion, but it's better than the original anti climactic conclusion added to home video versions. If this had any impact, it was a major step in forcing married men to keep their pants zipped when their wife was around, although I've heard several film historians refer to the character of Alex Forrest as a metaphor for AIDS in the sense of the warning of the dangers of promiscuity.",Fatal Attraction
4,gavin6942,Terrifying,7,28 September 2015,"A married man (Michael Douglas)'s one night stand comes back to haunt him when that lover (Glenn Close) begins to stalk him and his family.Apparently when this film came out it had some feminist backlash because it appears to show a career woman as psychotic, while the stay-at-home wife is good and subservient. That is one way to read it, but it would be putting meaning in there that probably was never intended.This is quite simply someone with mental issues going after another person. It has a bit of a morality tale in there, scaring men off of cheating. But there is not much in it about gender. It simple works better as a psychotic woman rather than a man, because a psychotic man with a knife is pretty mundane.",Fatal Attraction
5,lee_eisenberg,Attractive to ya?,10,13 July 2006,"There have been many stalker movies, but calling ""Fatal Attraction"" a stalker movie would be like calling ""The French Connection"" a cop flick. This movie haunts you like almost no other. Glenn Close gets into her psycho role so well that she makes your blood freeze. Apparently, when it came out, some people wondered whether it was looking at the danger of AIDS, while some people considered it anti-feminist. Both interpretations are legitimate, but they miss the point. The movie's purpose is to chill you. And let me tell you, if a certain scene involving a rabbit doesn't chill you, then you must already be dead! Anyway, you just gotta see this movie. It shows why Michael Douglas and Glenn Close are among the greatest stars of our era. And it just might save your life. Also starring Anne Archer and Fred Gwynne.So do YOU want to be ignored?",Fatal Attraction
6,jboothmillard,Fatal Attraction,9,14 July 2005,"An excellent thriller with a really screwed up love affair and an insane lover. Dan Gallagher (BAFTA nominated Michael Douglas) is the man troubled by the attractive Alex Forrest (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Glenn Close). He becomes attracted to Alex and they start an affair. But he soon refuses to see her, when his wife returns. When she keeps trying to tempt him, she starts to crack up and go mad. Dan starts to think she is dangerous, then he discovers she is more than dangerous. She is endangering his wife, Beth (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Anne Archer) and daughter Ellen (Ellen Hamilton Latzen). Dan is now determined to put Alex where she should be. Filled with excellent twists and turns, including the famous ""bunny boiler"" (now part of our socialisation) moment. Originally Alex was meant to slid her throat and Dan would get the blame, but luckily they changed it to have her first drowned, then be shot. This is what I like to refer to as the nut-case film, like Falling Down, One Hour Photo and Misery. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Director for Adrian Lyne (also nominated the Golden Globe), Best Film Editing, Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium and Best Picture, it won the BAFTA for Best Film Editing, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama. Alex Forrest was number 7 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, Michael Douglas was number 100 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, the film was number 15 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments, it was 65 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments, it was number 28 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills. Very, very good!",Fatal Attraction
7,ccthemovieman-1,One Of The Most Memorable Movies Of The '80s,9,28 January 2007,"You don't hear much about this film anymore, but in its day, this was the most-talked about movie of the year. It was a 'favorite topic of conversation about the office water cooler' for a number of weeks. At the time, it was a shocker. Nowaways.....who knows? As we become more and more desensitized to violence, sex and profanity, it takes a lot more to shock us.Still, this movie had memorable moments that have stayed with us who first saw it at the theater 20 years ago. Most of those memorable scenes, if not all of them, involve Glenn Close's character, ""Alex Forrest."" Man, this is a woman who would not be denied what she wanted: in this case, married man Michael Douglas.No sense going into all the details. Everyone knows them by now, anyway. Looking back, I think the film was a good lesson for men (or women) thinking about cheating on their spouses and assuming nothing bad will happen as a result. Men may commit more crimes, but that old adage about a ""woman scorned"" certainly is demonstrated here in spades! Douglas' character, ""Dan Gallagher,"" certainly can attest to that, but he is anything but a sympathetic character. Both actors do a superb job in here, but kudos also to the rest of the Gallagher family, played by Anne Archer (wife ""Beth"") and Ellen Hamilton Latzen (daughter ""Ellen."")Also, the cinematography shouldn't be overlooked. The widescreen DVD certainly brought out how nicely this film was shot and directed. This two-hour film keeps your attention all the way. The only thing I would change is the language, toning it down a bit. Otherwise, it's a classic thriller and one of the most famous films in the '80s.",Fatal Attraction
8,BA_Harrison,Adrian Lyne's bunny-boiling blockbuster.,8,2 March 2014,"New York lawyer Dan Gallagher (Michael Douglas) takes advantage of the fact that his wife Beth (Anne Archer) and daughter Ellen (Ellen Hamilton Latzen) are upstate for the weekend by bedding feisty blonde co-worker Alex Forrest (Glenn Close). When his family returns home, Dan would prefer to forget all about his extra-marital activities, but Alex isn't about to let him do soA taut, well directed, superbly acted cautionary Hollywood tale that warns of the potentially disastrous consequences of infidelity and casual sex (some say the film is a parable about AIDS), Fatal Attraction was a hugely popular phenomenon back in '87, spawning numerous imitators and even coining the now common phrase 'bunny boiler'. Although it shouldn't be all that easy to be sympathetic with Dan Gallagher, a selfish fool who risks ruining the lives of those he loves for a meaningless one-night-stand with a crazed psycho, director Lyne manipulates his audience's emotions so expertly that, by the end of the film, the viewer is firmly on his side, urging him on as he fights obsessive bitch Alex to the bitter end.",Fatal Attraction
9,moonspinner55,The kind of sexual hysteria that only seems to afflict women,6,4 November 2001,"Sex plus desertion equals madness--at least in the completely overwrought example offered here, wherein a one-night stand drives lonely businesswoman in N.Y.C. to stalk her weekend-affair, his wife and daughter. There's nothing remotely realistic about the scenario (neither Glenn Close's neighborhood--where fires burn on wet streets--nor Michael Douglas' job at the law firm are especially convincing), but the set-up is designed to get people talking, and on that level the movie succeeds. It's salacious controversy in a boiling pot! Too bad the filmmakers don't know how to wrap things up, resorting to camera-tricks and uneasy manipulation to heighten suspense. I'm sure there were women in 1987 who felt empowered by Close's portrayal of the 'victim', yet the way the film is engineered, she comes off as both the seducer and the scorned, and director Adrian Lyne relishes in making her a nutcase. That's OK for a thriller, but discussions about the way men treat women, the sexual politics of an extramarital affair, and man's fear of a possessive woman end right about the time Close boils the bunny. It's recycled ""Play Misty For Me"", though it does look good and has some strong acting. Ultimately it plays things too safely, and the ending is a mess. **1/2 from ****",Fatal Attraction
10,blanche-2,It won't be ignored,7,31 July 2005,"I guess the timing was right for ""Fatal Attraction."" It certainly had all the buzz in 1987 and spawned a lot of me-too movies. Actually, the plot reminded me of Clint Eastwood's ""Play Misty for Me"" so in its own way, ""Fatal Attraction"" was a me-too as well.Probably the strong performance of Glenn Close as the nutso Alex had a lot to do with the success and hype of this film, plus, of course, it was a great cautionary tale for men attempting to have affairs, so you can really see how women would love it.The original ending of the film would have made it much more interesting and novel, but apparently screening audiences didn't like it.All that out of the way, there are some major holes in the plot. I guess there's nothing new about having a psycho who has an enormous job, so I'll let that go. The big problem for me was Douglas cheating when he was married to gorgeous Anne Archer and had that darling little girl. If we were supposed to believe that he had an affair because Archer was too involved with the child, they needed to do more with the script, sorry. The reasons for his infidelity were not compelling - in fact, they weren't there. And while were at it, that bunny business was just a cheap cliché.I wonder if Close, with her wild hairdo, had not been the star of this, if it would have been such a big hit. She really took no prisoners in this role. Meryl Streep turned it down; she would have been equally effective. An actress of less talent - not sure. Whatever the reasons, Fatal Attraction got the cover of major magazines and was big box office. And except for that bunny stuff, it's a kick to watch.",Fatal Attraction
11,Quinoa1984,holds up over time... except...,7,23 September 2016,"It's amazing to think that dozens - maybe hundreds(?) - of movies, especially from the Lifetime channel, can trace their lineage to this film (and people like John Carpenter and Brian De Palma turned this down in part as they saw it as unoriginal, taking from Clint Eastwood's great debut, Play Misty for Me). I think that makes this hold up is the acting, pure and simple. Douglas and Close and also Anne Archer as the wife really make this material work as strong as it can - they sell every minute they can, and they have to. This is even in knowing that the movie doesn't really have a very firm moral leg to stand on; we should be on Michael Douglas' side, but he's the one that screwed up.Sure, Glenn Close is crazy, or a victim of abuse as well if one wants to dig a little deeper (who knows what happened with dear old dad before he died of that heart attack), but, and this is important, she's right (certainly initially) or at least has a point that should matter about how he's just tossing her to the wayside after a night or two of ""fun"". I like that Lyne and the writer have underlying implications that make it more harrowing and that it paints the two sides as neither right or wrong (though of course one is more wrong than the other, the wrongs don't make anything right) up to varying degrees. What makes it not stand up over time is the ending, or even the last act.From a writing perspective it should have ended how it was originally supposed to, with Alex killing herself and framing Dan as if it was murder. It calls back to the mention of Madame Butterfly, which is the set up and pay-off. But because the producers acquiesced it turns into the template for countless s***y movies where the character has one last hurrah to mess with the supposed heroes and blood is spilled and one more life is lost. In a sense my criticism is the same as Ebert's, that it kind of turns into a Friday the 13th movie. But at least for 85% of the running time, maybe 90%, it is a provocative, terrifying drama that has a simple moral message: don't cheat.",Fatal Attraction
12,michaelRokeefe,A sexy pschyco thriller!,7,9 June 2000,"A not so innocent fling backfires to haunt businessman Dan Gallagher, played by Michael Douglas. Gallagher, a happily married man, enters into a weekend dalliance with a winsome lover, Alex Forrest, played by Glenn Close. Gallagher doesn't realize that Miss Forrest took the tryst to heart and is determined to take him away from his wife and daughter.A thriller that takes you on a rollercoaster ride. The one short sex scene in the kitchen packs a hard and heavy punch. Your total attention is captured all the way to the powerful finale. The lovely Ann Archer is Gallagher's wife and there is nothing she won't do to keep her man.It sizzles, simmers and scorches. Too hot to not watch. Totally fulfilling, but leaves you wanting to watch it again.",Fatal Attraction
13,sunwarrior13,This Started Love Turned To Murderous Obsession Themes In Cinema,9,21 October 2011,"Adrian Lyne,the director of Flashdance,made Fatal Attraction as one of the most memorable films in the 1980's. It was a film that was against adultery committed by men.It became extremely popular because of the intense love scenes contained in the film and how it was well-directed by Lyne as evidenced by his Academy Award nomination for this film.The sexual politics also is what made this film unforgettable the year it was released until the present moment.Fatal Attraction is a thriller blended with horror.It stars Michael Douglas, Glenn Close and Anne Archer. The film was adapted by James Dearden and Nicholas Meyer from an earlier short film for British television,Diversion.The story of the movie centers which centers around a married man who has a weekend affair with a woman who refuses to allow it to end.Dan (Michael Douglas) is a family man whose one-night affair with Alex (Glenn Close) turns into a nightmare when she insists on continuing the relationship, claiming to be carrying his baby.Alex systematically terrorizes Dan, even temporarily kidnapping his daughter,in her attempts to win back his affection. Dan's besieged family man guiltily tries to preserve his marriage and family from the consequences of his own indiscretion.It was a memorable story that started the theme of love turned into murderous obsession in cinema as evidence by future movies like The Hand That Rocks the Cradle and Fear.The movie is strikingly well-acted.It received six Academy Award nomination including Best Actress for Glen Close whose performance as the love-struck psycho-siren,Alex who conveys the buried feminist message of the film in her challenge to Dan to take responsibility for his sexual behavior; as well as Anne Archer as Dan's wife.As stated earlier,the movie was well-directed as well by Lyne.The only negative thing I can say about this film is the horror element that was placed at the end of the film.It would have been better if the death of Alex was dealt in a dramatic fashion instead of a horrific way to end the film.But nevertheless,this remains as one of the most memorable films not only in the 1980's but in film history.",Fatal Attraction

15,hitchcockthelegend,I wont be ignored Dan !,9,17 April 2008,"Seemingly happily married man, Dan Gallagher, gives in to the seductive charm of Alex Forrest and partakes in a night of wild sexual passion with her. Trouble is, is that Alex is a tad unhinged and a woman scorned can be the ultimate nightmare.I have just revisited this monster smash hit from the 80s {highest grossing film of 1987}, and it still packs the same punch as it did back in the late 80s when it not only became a big hit, it also became a cultural phenomenon and one of the most talked about films of the decade. I'm saddened by the relatively average rating here because it's significance and bravery should always be highlighted instead of pointless allegations about it being only of its time. Just how many imitations did Fatal Attraction spawn i wonder ?, Fatal Attraction was a monster hit because it gave the audience something different, a monster flip flop of having the man stalked by an uncontrollable female loony. Much credit goes to screenwriter James Dearden for laying it out like a slowly tightening coil, because as the plot unfolds and Alex Forrest's Madame Butterfly fuelled revenge gathers pace, the audience starts to realise it has been doubly conflicted on the emotional character attachment front.Dan has done the dirty on his beautiful wife and child, the bastard deserves what is coming to him for sure?, Alex is right in that he's had his fun and now she can basically go and whistle at the moon, but the cheeky saver here from the makers is that Alex did the chasing knowing that Dan was happily married, she led the way fully armed with the facts. This makes for a wonderfully constructed thriller that ups the suspense quota to positively seal the deal with a heart stopping finale, i'm mightily relieved that American test audiences gave the thumbs down to the rather downbeat original ending that saw Alex committing suicide and thus framing Dan for her murder, the ending that stands may lose impact on repeat viewings, but boy it's still got a kick to it.Glenn Close is fantastic as Alex, playing against type she manages to convince as a disturbed individual, a perfect blend of sadness and soul destroying stupidness. Michael Douglas is also giving a performance of depth, firmly in the shadow of Glen Close's film stealing show, he none the less plays it perfectly and is believable in all aspects of the character, and i'm sure the ladies watching were pleased to see no sign of the saggy bottom that scared them in Basic Instinct 5 years later!. This film coupled with Wall Street in the same year would propel Douglas to major A list status, and he rightly deserved it in my opinion. Anne Archer is Beth Gallagher, the hurt wife of the piece, she looks stunning and sexy, but thoughts of her looks are quickly erased with a special two layered performance of note. Containing a great script and directed astutely by Adrian Lyne, Fatal Attraction remains one of the best thrillers of the 80s, it was talked about profusely back then, and here and now it should not be forgotten.9/10",Fatal Attraction
16,Theo Robertson,Done To Death,5,19 June 2003,"It`s impossible to imagine now but when this was released it was a fairly original film but reviewing it in 2003 I was dumbstruck at how this film kept half of Hollywood in a job for several years , this led to SINGLE WHITE FEMALE , PACIFIC HEIGHTS , THE CRUSH , UNLAWFUL ENTRY , THE CABLE GUY etc , films that had more or less the same plot of having someone fearing for their life , family or career by a stalker . On its own FATAL ATTRACTION is okay but it`s no masterpiece . As has been pointed out Dan Gallagher is married to Beth who`s a lot better looking than Alex Forrest . No offence to Glenn Close but Alex looks like a skull wearing a blond wig and Alex is equally bad on the domestic front where her rabbit pie cookery class leaves a lot to be desired . PLAY MISTY FOR ME has more or less the same plot and is a more enjoyable film",Fatal Attraction
17,Hey_Sweden,"""It's his bed. He's going to have to lie in it.""",7,13 March 2020,"This popular 1980s domestic thriller casts Michael Douglas in a particular kind of role that he would return to in subsequent years. Dan Gallagher is a lawyer for a publishing firm; although happily married, and father to an adorable little daughter, he decides to have a weekend fling with a new acquaintance. That acquaintance is an editor named Alex Forrest (Glenn Close, the most memorable asset that the film can boast). He later shrugs off the affair, but it definitely means a lot more to her. Revealing herself to be VERY disturbed, she first becomes a nuisance in his life, then she escalates into an out-and-out threat.""Fatal Attraction"" is an audience-pleaser, no doubt about that, building up to the kind of predictable finale that's guaranteed to get some viewers' bloodlust boiling. It's very slick, and tells a reasonably absorbing story (scripted by James Dearden, based on an earlier short subject he'd done). It quickly became a major bit of the pop culture of the time, with a particularly memorable line for Close in the form of ""I'm not gonna be IGNORED, Dan."". It also supposedly made married men second-guess having that extramarital affair.Now, it doesn't leave Dan blameless, despite his at-times sanctimonious attitude. But it also stacks its deck by making the Alex character such a lunatic. As buffs know, the film originally came with an ending that was a bit more subtle and interesting, but this ending was scrapped after an unsuccessful preview. There was obviously only one way that audiences wanted this to end.In any event, this is EXTREMELY well acted, especially by Close, and the under-rated, lovely Anne Archer, as the unknowing wife who deserved far better. Other familiar faces turn up (Fred Gwynne, Stuart Pankin, Ellen Foley, Jane Krakowski, Lois Smith, etc.), but most of them have little to do in the grand scheme of things.Don't go into this expecting any nuance, or restraint, but ""Fatal Attraction"" is fairly effective stuff, just the same. It DOES know how to push its viewers' buttons with a vengeance.That aforementioned original ending IS available on DVD and Blu-ray releases, in case people want to check it out.Seven out of 10.",Fatal Attraction
18,Doylenf,Chilling story of twisted obsession...,7,24 November 2006,"Thoroughly engrossing study of a woman obsessed by a man after a one night stand that he deeply regrets ever happened. When he tries to rid himself of her constant predatory approaches (including a number of unwanted phone calls), she snaps and resorts to all sorts of sordid tricks amounting to mental cruelty and physical harm as long as she gets her way.GLENN CLOSE, as Alex, is fascinating to watch, smiling slyly as she plays her dangerous cat-and-mouse game with the young lawyer (MICHAEL DOUGLAS). That gleam in her eye is a dangerous one and she has really nailed her character to the point where watching her gives one the chills. Douglas, too, is excellent in a very well written role that has him almost losing his life over a one night stand.ANNE ARCHER is fine as the wife who has no idea her husband is being stalked in such a dangerous manner. The final confrontation in the bathroom is the stuff of Grade-A horror.Highly recommended for the performances and the taut suspense that is almost unbearable by the time the resolution comes.",Fatal Attraction
19,preppy-3,So-so thriller elevated by acting and a knock-out ending,8,25 November 2017,"A happily married man (Michael Douglas) has a casual one night fling with sexy Alex Forest (Glenn Close). Unfortunately Alex is a psychopath and she assumes Douglas will leave his wife (Anne Archer) for her. When he turns her down he finds out she won't take ""no"" for an answer and she attacks.This was a huge hit at the box office in 1987. It was attacked by critics as being misogynistic and not always credible but the public loved it. I saw it opening night in Boston and I remember the audience screaming, yelling and jumping during the film. The ending especially had the audience (and me) on the edge of our seats. It is well-done with excellent acting by Douglas, Archer and Close...but it never really grabbed me emotionally. Sure I screamed and jumped like everybody else when Close lost it but it's hard not to because Close was so good in her role. Also the script was pretty familiar (remember ""Play Misty For Me""?) and rote but I do recommend it for the acting and ending.",Fatal Attraction
20,LeonLouisRicci,A Woman Scorned,7,11 March 2013,"Social commentary by way of Psycho Thriller is what this 1980's mega-hit is all about. It's message is so powerful and so resonant that it made quite an impact both artistically and commercially. But it is really an old story.It can't be called highly original as there are predecessors, it just seems that timing is everything and this was the time for this type of cultural expose. A well acted and directed movie it has style without being ultra-stylish (like the Director's Jacobs Ladder) and is delivered in a straightforward, tension filled manner.The Film holds up very well and can be at times quite suspenseful. It does nothing if not require or even force you to take a position on extra-marital affairs and the possible consequences. But after all it really is nothing more than ""Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned"". An ancient truth brought to you with modern titillation and terror.",Fatal Attraction
21,CinemaSerf,Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.,7,28 March 2021,"I recall during my studies in Aberdeen that this was one of the few films for which I ever witnessed a queue outside the cinema. Glenn Close and Michael Douglas were quite literally the talk of the town. The story sees Douglas (""Dan"") embark on an extra-marital affair with ""Alex"" (Close) whilst his wife Anne Archer (""Beth"") and their daughter are away. What starts off as a fairly raunchily portrayed relationship starts to turn a bit more frosty as he attempts to move on from his philandering and she, well she is determined to keep her new man. It transpires that ""Alex"" is quite an effective stalker, ingratiating herself into his family and ultimately creating a seriously perilous scenario for all concerned. Time hasn't been particularly kind to this, by 2021 standards it is all rather tame - but at the time it was a compelling drama with loads of sex, charisma and more than it's fair share of tension. Rated 18 then, I very much doubt it will still frighten or offend anyone nowadays - but Close is great as the gorgeous menace and Douglas positively reeks of eau de odium as the sleazy lawyer who reaps way more than he sows. No longer great, but still a good watch.",Fatal Attraction

Dan Gallagher (Michael Douglas) may have thought he was having a meaningless fling, but it was anything but meaningless to Alex. If she had to kill everybody, including herself, to have him in her life then that's exactly what she was going to do.This movie was so intense. Even the subtle shots of Alex picking at her clothes with the knife drew you in and had you on the edge of your seat. Glen Close stole the show. She made the movie what it was: excellent.",Fatal Attraction
24,evanston_dad,Too Bad It's the Ending You'll Remember,7,20 June 2008,"""Fatal Attraction"" is fatally flawed by an ending that goes too far, but the movie leading up to that schlocky mistake is much better than it has any right to be, and holds up quite well now (I saw part of it on T.V. not very long ago).Clearly, what sets this movie apart from the trash it could have been is the strength of the acting, notably Glenn Close, who delivers an absolutely terrifying and morbidly fascinating performance as the one-night stand from hell. And this film (along with ""Wall Street"" from the same year) was the first to suggest that Michael Douglas was turning into a much better actor than his father ever was. Poor Anne Archer gets stuck with a dreary role, that of the victimized wife, and it doesn't come close to taking advantage of her skills as an actress.Adrian Lyne's biggest claim to fame before this was ""Flashdance,"" and I can't think of a movie he's made since. Lyne apparently comes from a world where every single woman lives in a deserted warehouse hidden down some smoke-filled back alley.Grade: B+",Fatal Attraction
25,AlsExGal,"""It scared the living daylights out of every man in America!""...",9,21 May 2017,"... so says Tom Hanks in 1993's ""Sleepless in Seattle"" to his son in reference to this movie and comparing its outcome to a strange woman who has been writing the widower (Hanks) as a result of him appearing on a radio show. But that's another movie.The point is, its lesson was still easily recognizable in popular culture six years after it was made. What looks like an easy lay with a beautiful single woman can easily turn into an object lesson on Murphy's law. Dan Gallagher (Michael Douglas) is a successful NYC attorney, and on a weekend when his wife and daughter are away from home at his in-laws' house, he has a work meeting that includes Alex Forrest (Glenn Close), an editor for a publishing company. This leads to a drink at a bar, and that leads to a passionate one night stand that turns into a two night stand when Alex attempts suicide when Dan tries to leave.Dan thinks it's over. Alex has seemed to come to her senses. But then she tells him she is pregnant, and no she is having this baby because she is 36 and it may be her last chance. When Dan insists he is not leaving his wife for her, that he does not love her - well, let's just say that the opposite of love is not hate it's indifference, and Alex at first stalks Dan and gradually turns up the heat until his entire family is at risk. The suspense builds until the harrowing end.The thing is, Dan always loved his wife, subtly played by Ann Archer. She is beautiful, supportive, and he still has passion for her. They have a little girl and are a very happy family. But he just could not say no to what looked like a one night adventure that nobody need ever know about that turns into a nightmare.There is more to the film than the cautionary ""Don't cheat on your wife"" message. I think it's because Glenn Close does such a fantastic job playing Alex. There's something about her portrayal that, to me, paints Alex as ultimately powerful, not just outright insane. Until the end she mostly dominates what happens to Michael Douglas' character's life. I think this one has aged well and would still recommend it.",Fatal Attraction
26,AaronCapenBanner,Huge Hit About Affair Gone Very Wrong.,6,23 September 2013,"Michael Douglas plays successful lawyer Dan Gallagher, who has an affair with a colleague Alex Forrest(Glenn Close).

Harrowing film about the perils of having an affair is stylishly directed by Adrian Lyne, and very well acted, though almost goes wrong with too many ""false scares"" and ""false endings"".

27,FlashCallahan,I'll pity you because you're sick.......,8,19 March 2015,"Dan Gallagher is a successful New York lawyer with a beautiful wife, Beth, and a 6 year- old daughter,but spends an adulterous weekend with book editor, Alex Forrest. As far as Dan is concerned, it's a one time thing, but Alex has something more in mind, as she demonstrates even before the weekend is over. When he makes it clear that there is no future for them, Alex begins to seek him out, whether constantly calling him at home, or at work, and even visiting his apartment, and meeting Beth. Alex's obsession knows no bounds and she becomes increasingly violent, putting Dan's life, and his family's, in danger.......It's easily one of the most talked about films of all time, and at the time, very controversial, but its clear to see why, it's as terrifying as any horror movie because it could happen to any one of us, after all, lots of us have thought about, or even strayed off the path, and Alex is the forbidden fruit to Dan's Adam.But what's more frustrating is that, as a man, even though Dan does in some strange way deserve what is happening to him, you cannot help but feel sorry for the man. Yes, Alex should have gone straight to his wife and told her, in her mind she could have had Dan then, but the lengths she goes to, the scars she makes, makes her one of the most terrifying creations of modern cinema.Close is brilliant, absolutely brilliant as Alex, and the minute she is introduced to the film, you know, as an onlooker she is unhinged,the way she is dressed, it's almost succubus like, but for Dan, in the heat of the moment, is drawn in, becoming her incubus.It's a well made thriller, deftly filmed by Lyne, giving it lots of realism, rather than going down the exploitation route, like laters films that were spawned from this, did.The film did start its own sub-genre of its own, and for a long time after, even recently with The Boy Next Door, we were 'treated' to film where the main character becomes unhinged.See also....Pacific Heights Unlawful Entry Deceived Single White Female FearTo name but a few.This also proved that Douglas was, and still is one of the most powerful people in Hollywood, he's not afraid of subject matter, he doesn't hold back, and the scene where he states to Alex that he will help pay for the termination of her unborn child, you could almost hear the controversy alarm going off in his head.My only gripe is that they should have kept the original ending in, it's a serious movie, make the ending something spectacular. Even though the cinematic one is good, and for- filling, the intended one is perfect.An eye-opener, and of course marriage saver.....",Fatal Attraction
28,Wuchakk,Just 'Say No' to adultery!,8,12 March 2014,"""Fatal Attraction"" tells the story of a Manhattan attorney (Michael Douglas) who foolishly decides to have a weekend affair with a sharp blond (Glenn Close) while his wife (Anne Archer) & kid are away visiting the grandparents. The situation turns harrowing when the woman refuses to end the union.It's easy to compare ""Fatal Attraction"" with Clint Eastwood's ""Play Misty for Me"" (1971) since both films deal with a sexual affair gone bad and the clingy psycho woman, but other than these obvious similarities, the stories are totally different. In other words, just because you've seen one doesn't mean you shouldn't see the other. Both are very good, even great, and worth your time if you're in the mood for such a flick. That said, if I were to compare the two, I'd have to give the edge to ""Fatal,"" even though ""Misty"" has better locations (beautiful Carmel, California).Many question why Douglas would even consider cheating on a wife as beautiful as Archer, but the film shows that Douglas was starting to get sexually frustrated. For instance, there's a scene where Douglas is looking forward to sex but his daughter ends up sleeping on the bed with his wife while he gets stuck on the couch. It's also clear that Douglas didn't plan to commit adultery; the opportunity presented itself while his wife was away and it simply didn't take much for him to fall into the temptation. I'm not defending his unfaithfulness; in fact, I'm totally opposed to it, but at least his actions weren't premeditated.Others complain that Glenn Close isn't attractive in the film, but she looks pretty dang sharp to me. As the story progresses we see how truly disturbed she is it's only natural to view her as ugly; in fact, she becomes absolutely hideous. Regardless, beauty is in the eye of the beholder.The drama and acting are outstanding here. As Close becomes increasingly irritating and clingy you can see Douglas' progressive horror on his face, as if he's saying, ""What did I get myself into? I'm so stupid! How can I get rid of her? -- AaaaaAAAAHH!"" Some complain about Douglas breaking into Close's apartment and attacking her, but in light of her actions this is a realistic and understandable reaction.Then there's the debate about who's the real villain -- Close or Douglas -- and that Close deserves at least a little compassion, especially on the grounds that Douglas' character views their sexual union as a mere physical encounter and Close as a throwaway object in which he can satisfy his lust and pride (of course, you could argue the same vice versa). On the contrary, Close is a real person who apparently sees their union as something deeper. Something not just physical, but emotional and spiritual as well. Is it any wonder that she starts to increasingly lose it after Douglas breaks off the fling? Not that I'm justifying her actions. I'm just pointing out how ""Fatal Attraction"" effectively illustrates the possible consequences of treating people like throwaway sex objects. In the vast majority of cases, of course, the consequences aren't nearly as extreme, but there are always repercussions, even if it's just a broken or hardened heart. Try as we might, separating the physical from the spiritual is a lost cause.Nevertheless, the story makes it clear that Douglas ""made the bed he's sleeping in""; he certainly deserves to experience the consequences of his foolish actions, if for no other reason than to learn from his mistakes. But by the end of the film anyone who believes he (and his family) hasn't suffered enough is a sadist! As for compassion on Close's character: Yes, up to a point she deserves an ounce or two of human compassion (we all screw up and make wrong choices from time to time, don't we?), but only up to a point. After all, she walked into this fling fully knowing he was a married family man, not to mention she adamantly claimed to be discreet and insisted the same in him. Besides, it takes two to tango. Regardless, there is zero justification for her actions as the story progresses; she clearly earns the label of villain and Douglas the foolhardy victim.I do have a few cavils with the film: The phone plays too big of a role and gets bothersome after awhile. Plus, Douglas and his wife act too naively late in the story. The psycho woman is missing and has already broken into their house and kidnapped their kid from school. Shouldn't they be extremely on guard? Also, the 'kid' is actually a girl named Ellen, but throughout the film she looks like a boy named Allen. Go figure.Be sure to check out the original ending on the DVD. The original ending ***SPOILER ALERT*** has Close committing suicide and getting back at Douglas as his fingerprints are on the knife and he gets arrested. But Douglas' wife finds a cassette with Close admitting that she was going to kill herself so he gets off the hook. ***END SPOILER***. All the principle filmmakers, including Douglas, felt the original ending was ineffective and test audiences verified this; only Close and Archer defended it. Hence, eight months after completion they shot a different ending. Did they make the right choice? That's for you to decide, but I agree with the filmmakers that the deleted climax is rather flat whereas the newer ending is simply more entertaining. Less believable, perhaps, but more exciting and entertaining (but certainly not outside the realm of possibility, except for one horror cliché).Filmed on location in Manhattan and the New York countryside; the film runs 2 hours.GRADE: A-",Fatal Attraction
29,safenoe,"An explosive movie, and I do wonder what happened to...",9,9 September 2016,"It's hard to believe Fatal Attraction is almost 30 years old, and wow, what a groundbreaking movie it was at the time. I wonder how many male viewers were shocked into making chastity pledges to their better halves after walking out of the cinema.I think a modern day reboot is required, maybe with a same-sex relationship or something like that? One scene I remember in Fatal Attraction, when Alex (Glenn Close) blew off her date (off scene) to have dinner with Michael Douglas's character, which in turn led to their fateful (and eventually fatal) and passionate encounter at Alex's place, starting in the kitchen and then the bedroom. I think a criterion DVD release should feature cut scenes of who this mystery date (that Alex blew off) was, and how he coped with the news that Alex was obsessed with Gallagher (Michael Douglas), and how it was a close shave.One motif in Fatal Attraction is dancing and unsafe sex. Here the dancing happens after unsafe sex, and in Romancing the Stone and Basic Instinct, Michael Douglas's character danced with the characters played by Kathleen Turner and Sharon Stone, respectively, before embarking on unsafe sex.",Fatal Attraction

31,Mr-Fusion,"She won't be ignored, Dan!",7,7 April 2017,"""Fatal Attraction"" is one of those famous things that got people talking during every free moment – and also one that's sure to be spoiled if you're like me and wait 30 years to see it. Plot-wise, I know that to expect; but it still surprised me in some ways. Like the character of Alex Forrest. She doesn't have very much depth and it reduced to a stock schizo, but you wouldn't know it from Glenn Close's performance. Alex's (let's call them) antics have an unpredictability to them. Even when they're outlandish, they still work towards terrorizing Michael Douglas. She just keeps closing in, man. I don't think I'm really spoiling anything by saying Douglas eventually comes clean to his wife (Anne Archer) about the affair and that look of abject devastation on her face is horrible. If the writing ever fails you (and it gets iffy) the acting won't. This can be a real nail- biter at times, and that's because the performances elevate the trashy script. 7/10",Fatal Attraction
32,Smells_Like_Cheese,An unforgettable movie,9,13 February 2004,"One of the most talked about films of all time, Fatal Attraction, where married men learned a very valuable lesson: keep the pants zipped. I don't think there was a more talked about film in the 80's than Fatal Attraction, it made so many people think. It was a very intelligent thriller with great characters and a terrifying story. How many women get rejected by a man and haven't fantasized about just ruining their lives as revenge? Alex Forrest was the woman who didn't just fantasize, but lived it. How many men have a woman who won't let go of them no matter what they do? Even vice versa, but this was the movie that scared men right back into their wife's arms.Dan Gallagher is a successful, happily-married attorney living in Manhattan when he meets Alex Forrest. While his wife, Beth, and daughter are out of town for the weekend, he has a passionate affair with Alex. Though he thought it was understood to be a simple fling, she begins clinging to him. Dan explains that he must go home and Alex cuts her wrists in a suicide attempt. He thinks the affair is forgotten, but she shows up at various places to see him. She continues to call until he tells his secretary that he will no longer take her calls. She then phones his home at all hours, and then confronts him saying that she is pregnant and plans to keep the baby. Although he wants nothing to do with her, she argues that he must take responsibility. She will do anything at this point to make him be with her, even if it means destroying his family.Glenn Close who had only played the nice girl roles blew everyone's mind when she played Alex Forrest. What passion she put into the role and part of you couldn't really hate her. She brings up a great point to Dan ""Because I won't allow you to treat me like some slut you can just bang a couple of times and throw in the garbage?"". Your heart does break for her but at the same time you want to scream at her to let go of Dan and not hurt his family. Michael Douglas as Dan plays the role extremely well. He gives Dan a sense of realism, he's not a major jerk who just looks for random women, he makes a mistake and owns up to it. He's still very smart, but very frightened and rightfully so when he learns what Alex can do to him. You believe that he loves his family, he made a bad choice and don't we all? The consequences were a bit extreme this time. Ann Archer as Beth was not only beautiful, classy, but incredibly intelligent. She makes Beth so real and I loved her line that I found out was improvised when Dan tells her that he cheated ""What is the matter with you?!"", how many women or men have screamed that when getting hurt? Ellen Hamilton Latzen as Ellen, their daughter, is one of the best child actors you could imagine. She doesn't make her character annoying and when she sees her parents crying, she breaks down and you just want to hold her so badly. What talent at such a young age. Fatal Attraction was made so well and the reason why I think it holds up is because it is a very intelligent movie with great characters. You could relate in one way or another. Just a side note, I do wish they stuck with the original ending since it would have made more sense with Alex's character, I won't give it away, but it also would have been ironic with her and Dan's love for ""Madame Butterfly"". But people wanted to see Alex get what she had coming after her being named a ""bunny boiler"". But trust me when I say this is one of the best movies to come out of the 80's and I still love watching it.9/10",Fatal Attraction
33,MovieAddict2016,Not prescient anymore,5,20 August 2005,"""Fatal Attraction"" was a cultural phenomenon when it came out back in 1987 and spawned a whole sub-genre of films like ""Swimf@n"": mainly movies that dealt with psycho killers taking revenge on their loved ones who have dumped them.Glenn Close is the psycho in this film.

She decides to begin maniacally stalking him and his family - threatening to kidnap and kill his daughter and his wife.The movie's time has come and gone. It's outdated, not thrilling anymore.

34,lasttimeisaw,Fatal Attraction,6,29 May 2012,"I made a promise to watch more Oscar-nominated performances from Glenn Close after ALBERT NOBBS (2011), the first one is this notoriously famous thriller-drama from the genre hotshot Adrian Lyne. The narrative is straightforward and rather inevitable. First of all, the film never fail to keep the appearance engaging and captivating while bypassing a severe flaw in its avowed mantra, it always takes two persons to exert an immoral affair, but eventually the punishment usually always falls on the woman, even grants a pretext of psychopath, a tacky happy ending does fling an anticlimax and one might find himself stuck in a moot situation, who we should feel more sympathetic? So, the moral support is preferably unstable, the film fulfills an educational motive and emblematizes itself as an immaculate prototype of monogamic conformity and a wake-up call to warn all the horny married-man. However the real gem lies in the sterling cast, which has been against all odds to generate a great deal of fidelity to stimulate the flares of lust, possession and destruction (frilled with a somewhat pretentious family value). Close and Archer both received their Oscar nominations, Lyne's female fixation works out properly and both actresses manage to wrestle with their largely conventional roles and excel themselves in a better-than-expected anticipation. Close is on her best form in portraying the maniac other woman, with a menacing charisma until the breakdown. Douglas is typecast and stays put in his comfort zone. The set pieces are sturdily devised even though it seems to be a lowdown trick involving an ambiguous pregnancy, nevertheless the finale showdown is masterfully done, the bathroom confrontation has a thoroughgoing suspense and marks the genuine craftsmanship from director Adrian Lyne.So a 6/10 is a medium rating which is hampered by an outmoded moral criterion judging by the opinions of today, but still a pleasant piece of work worthy of more attention.",Fatal Attraction

It's a great cause & effect result that is, from Alex's psychological breakdown to Dan's suffering from his biggest regret.The acting was excellent and the plot's pacing was fast and to-the-point, one tension-filled scene after the other.

36,sddavis63,Excellent Performance by Glenn Close In A Rather Ordinary Movie,6,28 July 2003,"Had it not been for the performance of Glenn Close, this movie wouldn't really be worth the effort of watching. She shines in an excellent performance as Alex Forest, the spurned lover of Dan Gallagher (Michael Douglas), whose obsession with their relationship becomes progressively more violent. Close manages to play Forest as the successful business type, the emotionally wounded woman and the deranged psychopath, and she makes every aspect of Alex believable. Michael Douglas is always competent, and is no less here than anywhere else, but his portrayal of Gallagher to me seemed a bit shallow and unconvincing.The story itself (of the spurned woman seeking revenge) is hardly original, and even the twists and turns seem typical and predictable, and more than a few things in the story made little sense. First, given that Gallagher seemed to have a good relationship with his wife Beth (Ann Archer) and a happy family life as the father of Ellen (Ellen Hamilton Latzen) it seemed to me that he fell too quickly and too easily under the spell of Alex. Their relationship didn't come across as believable to me. Then, setting up the last confrontation of the movie, Gallagher is shown locking the doors to his house, with his body language suggesting that he had forgotten to lock them before. What? After everything he and his family have been through at Alex's hands, he didn't think to keep the doors locked at all times?! How did this guy get through law school? Finally, the ending was predictable, and for about the 914th time in the movies we see a villain who seems to be dead come back to life. There's no shock to this anymore, although I suppose when ""Fatal Attraction"" was actually released (in 1987) it was actually only the 674th time this had happened. In short, there really wasn't much imagination at the end.This movie is all right as a way to spend a lazy Sunday afternoon, but except for a few scenes (the thought of the boiling pot in the kitchen - and its contents - will remain in your mind after the movie's over) this is hardly edge of your seat stuff. Watch it for the excellent performance by Close, though.6/10",Fatal Attraction
37,thesar-2,"Play 'Fatal Attraction' for me, instead.",10,27 June 2009,"Recently, I saw 'Play Misty for Me' for the first time and though it thoroughly reminded me of one of my all-time favorite films, 'Fatal Attraction,' I knew it not only came first, but more than a decade earlier. Not, that the idea/story behind any ""fatal attraction"" plot is anything new, I think 'Attraction' enormously doubled the suspense, realism and believability than 'Misty' could even come close. Sad to say, but I've met people like Close's character Alex on more than one occasion, though not so murderous, but sick nonetheless. Alex is obsessed with honest family man and lawyer Dan (Douglas) after just one weekend fling. Dan's loyal to his wife and daughter, despite his one mistake in committing adultery. And he's paid back tenfold by his incredibly huge error in judgment by selecting Alex. She's a very ill individual. Some say psycho, I say sick. (Much as I agree with the same statement for Norman Bates.) Not being a psychologist, or doctor, I do feel someone acting psycho is making a choice, something they knew they were doing. This is why Close was so good in this role (unlike the unbelievable acting of Walter in 'Misty.') Close showed such depths of someone completely sick and in need of help and yet most people (including Dan) would just brush it off as obsessive behavior. In addition, every actor in 'Attraction' was suburb, including the young daughter. I believed everything in this movie could (and probably does) happen, even the chance encounters, opportunities and down to the emotions the characters felt. It never felt slow, it felt real and that's what scared me the most.Side Note: Other than Close's hair, the cord-phones and the shameless ""I (heart) NY"" ads, this could have very well been made today. I think that's one of the definitions of a classic. I can look past these three minor dated elements to cherish the role of Close's life and further my enjoyment of Douglas's wonderful works.",Fatal Attraction
38,sol-kay,I don't want to lose my family,8,28 October 2006,"(There are Spoilers) It seemed so innocent at first to copyright attorney Dan Gallagher, Michael Douglas, meeting associate editor Alex Forrest, Glenn Close, at a book signing ceremony and having a drink with her. That drink not only turned out to be a nightmare for Dan his wife Beth, Anne Archer, and six year old daughter Ellen, Ellen Hamilton Latzen, it turned out to be one for a very emotionally unstable Alex as well.Having a hot and wild one night affair with Alex Dan thought that it was all over when Beth and Ellen came back home but Alex had other ideas in mind for him. Not wanting to be treated like some hooker that Dan picked up at a party Alex started putting the screws on him and his family by suddenly blackmailing Dan and later going as far as almost driving him to the point of murdering her. Dan trying his best to reason with Alex and going so far as apologizing if he hurt her feelings, by not containing their relationship, didn't keep the obsessed and crazed woman from letting up her harassment and threats to him and Beth. On the phone and at his job, where Alex kept threatening Dan and Beth. Later she even totaled his car in the office garage. It was when Alex confronts Dan in the subway and told him that she was pregnant that he becomes a bit more understanding and sympathetic to her by offering to pay for her abortion which was the worst thing that he could have possibly said to her. Alex wanted his child in order to have a legal and moral right to him!Cutting her off from him by changing his phone number and planning to move out of New York Alex goes as far as posing as a buyer of Dan's co-op apartment! In order to find out, from Annne, his new place of residence as well as almost drive Dan to a nervous breakdown. Moving out of the city to Mount Kisco didn't help either. Alex gets so brazen in her turning Dan's life into a living hell by then kidnapping his daughter Ellen out of school, only to spend the afternoon with her at a local amusement park. This almost causing Beth to have a fatal car accident as she drives through the town frantically looking for Ellen. Alex goes so far in her attacks on Dan and his family to even kill little Ellen's cute and cuddly little pet rabbit ""Whitey""! She ended up leaving it stewing in a large pot on the stove in the Gallagher kitchen!Coming clean with Beth only made thing worse for Dan by having him thrown out of the house and ending up going back to the city to Alex's loft apartment and almost strangling her for the hell she caused him and his family. The end to this modern horror story couldn't have come soon enough with a vengeful and now totally insane Alex sowing up at the Gallagher home. Alex ends up confronting a terrified Beth, who just was released from the hospital, over who of the two women in the end will have Dan all to herself.Dan who seemed to have been involved with a number of other one-night stands, by the casual and experienced way he got involved with Alex, got a real education in how to be true to your wife by not trying to fool around behind her back with another woman. There's always that one woman, if one fools around long enough, who won't take no for an answer and Dan was to find that out the hard and sharp way!",Fatal Attraction
39,ElMaruecan82,What if it happened to you? ...,9,24 July 2011,"A married man cheating on his wife, isn't that one of the most unoriginal plot premises ever? But one film tackled this subject with some special ingredients to create a stronger impact on people's minds. I'm not sure anyone who participated to ""Fatal Attraction"" anticipated the public's reaction, but they surely knew that beyond the thrills, something in Adrian Lyme's film would keep people ""attracted"" to it.The key is the identification with the main characters, starting with Dan Gallagher, played by Michael Douglas. I shouldn't even say 'played' because the point of the part is not for the actor to dilute himself behind the character, but just 'to be natural', and create this everyman's feeling. Michael Douglas was the perfect choice because never all-through the film, do we see the movie star, but simply a man with a happy Family, a beautiful wife and a cute little girl, a man with a regular job, not too rich, not too poor, a man who'll be attracted to a single-worker, Alex Forrest, played by Glenn Close, in a career-defining role. Glenn Close proved her immense versatility by playing a woman, not sensual, but sexual. And this is an important aspect, because we must understand why Dan, who had everything to be happy, succumbed to the temptation. Alex Forrest exuded that temptation, there's something in the way she dresses, she makes up, that make her absolutely appealing. And the sex scene is not gratuitous as its intensity serves the purpose of the film, the passion on that kitchen sink is proportional to the ephemeral aspect of the relation, and seems so genuine and improvised, that we laugh as the sight of Dan unable to carry Alex to the bed, with his pants in legs.About Alex Forrest, we all know she's one of the most hated villains or female characters ever. But I think people are overreacting, she's no better, nor worse than other psychotic women like Evelyn Draper or Annie Wilkes. But I try, even as a man, to understand Alex Forrest. The way Glenn Close portrayed her, was like a tormented, not demented (yet) person, she's probably been abused in the past, or lived an experience that lowered her self-esteem, even though she tries to hide it during social occasions. The costume designer of the film did a great job in making Alex so immediately desirable. Alex literally gives herself to Dan as she genuinely loves him, and the way Dan handles this aftermath will cement the feeling of rejection, incarnated by the classic line ""I'm not gonna be ignored, Dan"". There is an emphasis in the word 'ignored' which illustrates the sensitive nerve touched in Alex's heart, she's not a woman to get and to throw, and Dan should have handled things more tactfully.Basically, there are two pivotal points in Alex's evolution into a villain : the bunny scene and the ending. Before the bunny scene, there was still something sympathetic in Alex's portrayal, thanks to Glenn Close's powerful performance. Take the scene where the Gallaghers are having a party and Alex is alone turning on and off the lights, never had the rejection and loneliness been so palpable, it was like the last shot of a woman about to kill herself, and maybe whatever she did after was the only way to pull herself together. Another aspect is Anne Archer's great supporting performance, as she embodies the total decency of Beth, a woman who's a good wife, a good mother, which contrasts with Dan's immoral behavior, and the harassment he endures from Alex seems like a kind of Justice, but after the bunny episode that set the audience off psychologically, Dan reveals his affair and Beth is not a victim anymore, threatening to kill Alex if she ever approaches her family again. As it's impossible not to root for Beth, and since its Dan's first step to redemption, Alex becomes the villain.The original ending had Alex killing herself à la Mrs. Butterfly with the knife Dan held in the previous fight scene, accusing him of homicide. Although that ending echoes some scenes before, I can understand why it didn't appeal to the viewers as it was impossible to perceive Alex like a victim after the bunny scene, and Beth's needed to get off her passive role, and become the housewife who protects her family. I understand the classic ending flirts with some archetypal thriller's situations, like Alex becoming a kind of one-dimensional knife-holding villain, or the classic last jump from the bathroom, yes, the climax is not without some flaws, but overall it makes the movie probably more accessible, the thriller even more efficient because Dan's redemption relied on the difficulty to get rid of Alex : it needed a fight scene, blood and pain. And the ending suggests of course that Dan can go back to his family, he's redeemed. And now, the viewers can ask themselves ""What if?"" The social commentary is the strength of the film, in the sense that it constantly questions what we would have done if we were in Dan's shoes? The movie is eye-opening on that level, and creates for infidelity, the same unsettling feeling of fear and apprehension than ""Jaws"" for swimming, a feeling foreshadowed at two moments before the affair started, where sex is mentioned as an act not without consequences. And to those who still cheat on their wives, they'll probably have the common courtesy not to abandon the girls they just slept with, whether they are the mistresses or simply one-stand nights, in order not to endure not even one tenth of Dan's nightmare. Maybe Alex would appear less as a villain in our days where loneliness and mental troubles are more banal, but ""Fatal Attraction"" doesn't feature villains or heroes, but mostly people victims of unpredictable, sometimes 'fatal' circumstances, as it happens in real life",Fatal Attraction
40,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Basic instinct.,7,2 October 2020,"Though the conversation surrounding Close's character is certainly different today than it was when the film was first released, 'Fatal Attraction (1987)' still holds up as an ever-escalating thriller which doesn't demonise its central stalker as much as you may expect it to. For much of the narrative, there's a palpable and often frustrating tension between its 'everyman' protagonist and the 'one-night stand' he just can't seem to ditch. The conflict comes from character, from a deep misunderstanding that never resolves itself no matter how plainly the main players state their intentions. This drama has a nice sense of escalation to it, starting out annoying and ending up life-threatening. It's rather compelling and very much feels like something that could really happen. Of course, the affair does take a lot - and I mean a lot - of inspiration from 'Play Misty For Me (1970)'. However, it doesn't seem like a shameless rip-off. It's an entertaining and well-acted experience. 7/10",Fatal Attraction
41,g-bodyl,Affairs Can Be Fatal!,9,29 December 2014,"Fatal Attraction is your prototypical 80's thriller that follow along the lines of Dressed to Kill and so on. In other words, it's a romantic thriller and even a borderline slasher film. I enjoyed this movie very much. I heard about the famous scenes, including one with a rabbit, which is what led me to the movie. The buildup is fantastic which leads to an effective ending, though somewhat unbelievable and unoriginal. The film works as a romance film as well as a thriller and at times it can be quite creepy.Adrian Lyne's film is about a lawyer named Dan Gallagher who is happily married to his loving wife, Beth. When Beth leaves town for the weekend, Dan strikes up an affair with an editor named Alex Forrest. However, Alex refuses to let the affair end and she preys on Dan and his loved ones until he comes to her terms.The acting is very good. Glenn Close delivers a terrific performance as the malicious Alex Forrest who uses unnecessary means to get her way. Her performance is haunting and the final ten minutes proves that statement. Michael Douglas does a good job, although this is one of his cliché roles. Anne Archer does a great job looking pretty for Dan, and I cannot see why there would be an affair in the first place! Overall, Fatal Attraction is an excellent thriller that morphs into a slasher film for the final fifteen minutes or so. Not like that is a bad thing. The film is really creepy and it's a wonder how they can get away with these kind of things, especially in the 1980's. The bunny scene is a very influential scene and one that no doubt created similar scenes in other movies. A very creepy, well-done romantic thriller. I rate this film 9/10.",Fatal Attraction
42,cricketbat,Breaking the seventh commandment has swift consequences,8,6 October 2021,"Breaking the seventh commandment has probably never had such swift consequences in film as it does in Fatal Attraction. I've always found Glenn Close to be kind of scary anyway and her portrayal of Alex Forrest, a woman who will NOT be ignored, is absolutely chilling. The reason why this movie is so scary is because it feels like it could really happen-which, I guess, is just one of the many reasons why you shouldn't commit adultery.",Fatal Attraction
43,lesleyharris30,"Exciting and Thrilling, albeit a Far Fetched Finale,",7,15 February 2016,"Fatal Attraction is a good movie with a well developed storyline and a terrific cast. It's an exciting two hours as we follow a man, played as natural as always by Michael Douglas, starting an affair with a woman, a stunning performance from Glenn Close, who develops an obsession with him, it's very intense as Close creates a psychopathic demeanor for her role that only worsens as the film progresses, the best moments are the two characters simply talking as Douglas tries to make sense of the whole situation. I love the first half of the movie, if it had remained as dramatic and realistic as it did for the second half I could have given this a nine, but it turns in to a straight up thriller after a while, it may be fun to watch, but I was thoroughly enjoying how plausible the whole situation was, so I was disappointed when the plot became far fetched, particularly the ending, which leaves a lot of loose ends. I felt Alex Forrest's character development could have been more natural, the obsession she develops for Gallagher is understandable, as well as how her mentality breaks down, but it could have been a more subtle transition, instead of simply turning this woman in to a horror character, we were able to feel for her and the love she had for him in the beginning, until we eventually could not sympathise for her in any way, it became confusing how the director wanted me to view Forrest. It has many imperfections, but Fatal Attraction is still an enjoyable film with top notch acting from its three leads, I would recommend it if you ever see it on television and are looking for a good drama, but don't go out of your way to see it. A fling turns in to a nightmare for a Manhattan lawyer when his lover refuses to end the affair. Best Performance: Michael Douglas",Fatal Attraction
44,The-Sarkologist,Affairs that End Badly,6,19 June 2020,"I was a teenager when this film was first released in the cinema, and I remember that it was being plugged pretty heavily. Then again, back in those days Michael Douglas was definitely one of the go to actors for this type for film, which is probably why Basic Instinct is also on my list of films to watch in the not too distant future. Anyway, I'd never got around to seeing this, and a part of me felt that maybe I'd give it a go, especially with all the hype that was surrounding it back in the day.Well, the film is about this guy, Dan Gallagher, who I would say is happily married, except that he has an affair with this woman that he meets at a party, and turns out to also be working for one of his firm's clients. Well, his wife goes away to the country and Dan and Alex decide to have lunch together, and you can probably guess where things go from there. In fact, as the title suggests, the fling doesn't turn out all that well, particularly since Alex ends up being obsessed with Dan, to the point that she is now out to ruin his relationship.I guess the thing that stood out is that these days I'm not sure if Alex's character would go down all that well with current social trends. The reason I say this is because it is generally portrayed that it is the guy that behaves the way Alex behaves as opposed to the way the film makes it out to be. Also, I sort of get the idea that men hitting women also doesn't go down too well, no matter how bad the woman happens to be. This probably why these days you tend to have women fighting women, and men fighting men.Anyway, the film sort of reminds me of what tends to be argued by the Men's Rights Movement, who in many cases tend to be conservative men who are upset that women tend to be believed over and above the men. However, no matter whether they are right or not (and there are certainly instances of domestic violence where the woman is the perpetrator as opposed to the man), it is generally the case that men tend to be the more violent and abusive in the relationships. Yet, it is also a pretty tricky topic in any case, and one that I certainly can't give a solution to.Another thing that stood out is, well, how affairs really don't tend to work out all that well. Okay, it could be dramatised somewhat more, but it does go to show how people can, well, become obsessed with other people. In a way I can see some realism in what actually happens here, namely because I have seen similar things being played out in my time here on Earth, whether it be at work, or whether it be at university. Mind you, I tend to try to keep my nose out of those things, but I guess once could say that things like these don't always end up having a happy ending.In a way, I did find that the film was somewhat slow in places, but I guess it does have a lot to do with building up the suspense. It is certainly challenging, and confronting, particularly since it isn't always all that easy to walk away from people, especially when one has had such an intimate relation with them. I guess that it is a reminder that we can't always keep skeletons in our closet for too long, because they tend to always come out and haunt us in the future.",Fatal Attraction
45,filipemanuelneto,A remarkable film that marked the career of Douglas and Close.,8,15 November 2020,"I recently saw this film and I confess that I don't feel disappointed in my expectations. It is commonly regarded as a milestone in the sexy-thriller genre, and the enviable record of six nominations - which did not go beyond that - for the Oscars (Best Film, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress, Best Director, Best Editing and Best Adapted Screenplay), associated with the huge commercial success that it achieved, it kind of consolidated that status and guaranteed it a place in the history of cinema.The film is about a man stuck in a monotonous but sincere marriage, who falls into the error of engaging sexually with an elegant and lonely woman he meets at work. Far from accepting that it was just a weekend affair, she decides to pursue him and take things to the last consequences. The story is very good and Adrian Lyne was able to develop it with coherence and logic, creating a dramatic tension that increases as the ending approaches and the characters' attitudes become more and more radical. The pace is perfect, there are no dead moments or scenes that seem out of place. There are some sex scenes, with some nudity, but it is nothing that shocked me, although it is normal that at the time they were considered quite bold. Everything seems perfect until we get close to the end, where the director truly loses his hand and makes a histrionic ending with some improbable ideas. I think that here, commercial logic and the bet on sensationalism prevailed.Much of the success of this film rests on the enormous performance of the two central actors in the plot, Michael Douglas and Glenn Close. Both were experiencing a magnificent moment in their careers: Douglas would win Oscar that same year with ""Wall Street"" and Close, despite being little known and a risky bet on the part of the production, he had enormous talent, evident in how your character worked, loaded with psychological nuances and sudden changes in mood and feelings. If the two actors were able to stand out in isolation, they were incomparable together, with the ideal chemistry and a remarkable likelihood. Both achieved, with this film, one of the most iconic works of their lives (particularly Close). The film also features the participation of Anne Archer, impeccable in the role of the betrayed wife.Being a film that bets so much on the story told and on the performance of the actors, I don't think it is surprising to be a film with such discrete production values. The film is good, but it does not stand out at this point: cinematography is the standard of the time it was made, and the sets and costumes, although they fit into the story, do not bring anything remarkable in themselves, apart from the relative monochromatic of Close's costume, almost always in white tones. The effects are almost nil and the Maurice Jarre soundtrack is definitely not the most interesting I've heard.",Fatal Attraction
46,BaronBl00d,Two Ships that Collide in the Night,8,19 July 2008,"Seminal classic about adultery, betrayal, stalking, vengeance, and psychotic behaviour when Michael Douglas has an affair with sexy Glenn Close, tries to break off said affair, and then has his life rearranged by a woman in desperate need for therapy and a prison cell. The chemistry between the two leads is highly evident as both seem so real and comfortable in their roles. Douglas is smarmy one moment, charming another, and caring - Close can be dominant, submissive, and then child-like. These ranges never seemed to me to be forced or strained. This is indeed your typical thriller though so much of what we see done today owe this film a lot. Director Adrian Lyne knows how to create tension, character depth, suspense, and climatic moments. Many, many scenes are very strong from the infamous ""rabbit"" one to the sultry sex scene, to the whole Ann Archer(Douglas's put upon wife)saving her life ending. It is also a product of its time and discusses relevant issues about adultery, matrimony, sex, and commitment. While it easy to lay(pun intended) blame - now I am going to get a bit philosophical and opinionated here - on Close's character for getting real creepy, excessive, and going way to far(no argument here), Douglas's character is also to blame as a married man having an extra-marital affair(though he never hides that fact from Close prior to their bodily combustion scenes). Douglas nevertheless has the affair while having a beautiful, loving, caring wife and lovely child at home with a good job and high prospects. In a sense Fatal Attraction is more a cautionary tale for men looking to truly have it all - the cost just might be everything you possess - tangible and figurative(self-respect, love, trust, etc...). I enjoyed this film for the roller-coaster of suspense it provides. It is quite a ride and as I said much of the film and its two primary performers will leave their indelible forms on your internal psyche. Archer does a very good job as the truly pitiable wife. Fred Gywnne is inexplicably wasted in a nonessential role. This is the standard to which all psychotics preying on their former illicit lovers films are evaluated.",Fatal Attraction

Audiences literally roared during viewings in the eighties, because this movie hits a sensitive nerve about the sacredness of family life, which gets brutalized viciously.Any bad? Yes, you know what's coming storywise miles away, no surprises there, but the brilliant way in which this story is performed just makes up for all the hollywood cliches. It is SO juicy and SO thrilling, that after decades rewatching it again and again, it still stands strong today. One of the biggest popular hits of the entire eighties.

50,videorama-759-859391,A fatally attractive thriller,8,29 April 2014,"Given it's simple premise, this movie is realistically told and driven, taken from a realistic standpoint, and this is what really makes it work, involving us for it's near two hours. Many other of these, psychological type thrillers, followed, where if you've seen too many, you quit, because you know the drill. That's what turned me off seeing 1994's The Crush. But getting back off off the beaten track, here is a movie, that may seriously make you think about infidelity, if having an affair, with a sexy, pleasant, and genuine, seemingly normal stranger (Glenn Close) a publisher who Douglas is introduced to at a party. She's all of those things, but underneath she bellies a real dark jealous self. A fervid affair erupts, where after a couple of hot interludes and steamy sex, Douglas does the right thing and breaks it off, only Close is not so understanding or forgiving. Like a dog with a bone, she obsessively keeps coming back at Douglas, trying to make him understand, what's it like to suddenly be dumped, first trying suicide tactics, to make Douglas has a guilt complex, which is a desperate attempt to sucker him back into her life. In the real world, it's nightmarish to think of a relationship like this, happening, because deep down, on the surface, it's not that far from the truth. Close was so fantastic, letting loose her real mad and wrecked self, driven by rejection and obsession, with a range of emotions, so realistically portrayed, especially ones involving her breaking down, parts of this were at times were jarring or unnerving. Douglas is average, while Archer is better as the betrayed wife who eventually supports Douglas through this nightmare, at one point, threatening to kill Close, if she comes near her family again. Although there was an alternate ending, where Douglas killed Close and was charged with her murder, I thought this opted ending could have been better, as in how she died. Warning scene, and one that sadly sticks out, one I hated was the burning family pet rabbit scene. An 88 hit, FA I really liked. It's good, but being a Academy Award nominee film, was something that escaped me. It's a lesson learning movie, about infidelity. Stick to the straight and narrow.",Fatal Attraction

So the other night I was channel-surfing for something good to watch, and there it was about to start on SHO. I decided to tune in.No point in introducing the film's plot, which everyone knows. So let me just add a couple of general observations. First, I was surprised how good the film actually was. I'm not sure where I had gotten the idea in my head that this probably wasn't going to be all that good, but it is an intense, very intense, stalker-drama. Second, the three lead performances are rock solid, led by a believable crazy-over-the-top Glenn Close. Her transformation from lover to stalker to hater is absolutely spine-tingling. Third, the movie of course feels a bit dated when you see not a single communication exchange on mobile devices. Instead, old landline phones actually ring out loud. No texting of course. Fourth, after watching this the other night, I read up a bit on the movie's history and legacy, and it was then that I learned that the movie's original ending was changed drastically into what we now know as the ending. The original ending sounds sounds more logical to me that what it eventually would become, although I can certainly see the shock value in the new ending.Bottom line, this movie was a pleasant surprise all around, and these 2 hours just flew by. Glad that I finally joined the rest of the cinema-loving crowd and now have seen ""Fatal Attraction"", 33 years after the facts. If you are one of those who like me hadn't seen this yet.

Michael Douglas did his best at playing a family man who has the gall to fool around in which he jeopardizes his family and work. Glenn Close who was stunning at playing Alex, the psycho who would take no for an answer! Affairs ruins lives whether you're single, married, divorced, or widowed. A fling has consequences; pregnancies, diseases, or even death. If ever anyone decided to fool around outside the marriage, that person knows, the nightmare will never end! The cost of that affair claimed the pet rabbit, and the harassment from Alex(Glenn Close) got really extreme. Now I heard that there are two endings to this movie, I really prefer Alex taking the bullet after the drowning failed. This movie could really pass off as a horror, since the rabbit was cooking in the pot, and the acid being spilled on the car. This movie could easily scare the adulterer, not encourage.

54,subxerogravity,Almost thirty years later and I still creep over that rabbit,7,28 August 2016,"Micheal Douglas (With the possible exception of his academy award winning turn as Gordon Gekko) tends to play nice guys who do some shady things. In this case he's Dan Gallagher, living the perfect 80s lifestyle with his wife and kid, they are about to leave the city and move to a suburb to raise a family, but at a party, he meets Alex, played by Glen Close. Adrian Lyne and his actors do a good job of showing us the instant attraction between the two without saying much. Nothing happens, but a second encounter puts all the cards on the table for what seems like a no strings attached bed room dance, and Dan is all like, ""why not, my wife and kid are out of the city looking at houses, I can do this. So he gives her the passion right on the kitchen counter"". So they had fun while his wife is away, no big deal, now we can go back to our regular lives right? Right? Unfortunately for Dan, this is not a Woody Allen movie, the consequences for stepping out on your wife don't end in a comedic folly. As they are having fun, he notices slowly what he just gotten into, with jokes about seeing her father die and her getting very upset when he leaves during their second encounter.Then she goes bonkers--real bonkers and just when he thought he had her under control, she just increases the level of Bonkers (An impressive feat might I add cause when you watch it, Alex gives a WTF moment, she only tops as the movie goes on).It's effecting his work (Lucky it did not effect his relationship with his boss Herman Munster from the Munsters, cause you know, wouldn't want him to do the Munster mash on you), and of course she's effecting his wife in kid. It's a hard lesson to learn.But it's hard not to still love Micheal Douglas in this movie. Like I said his movie star days seem to have him playing appealing men who get involved with some shading things, Douglas is charming and you can't help but to side with him despite this whole thing being his fault.Stranger for me is that Anne Archer, who plays his wife in the movie was a hot number here. Every time she smiled, I thought to myself ""Why would he cheat on her?"" I can tell you why. Glenn Close is really sexy in this picture. That's what she has going for her here, mad sex appeal. She was oozing it on the screen and as charismatic as Douglas is, Close fuels the fire. You really could not blame him for wanting to get a piece of that (Which in reality is why he should not have done it cause she made it all too easy for him. I mean way too easy, so easy you knew it was going to end badly).Fatal Attraction has an amazing story well done by the director and the actors that allows it to stand the test of time despite it being so engulfed in the decade it was filmed. Me personally, I remember this New York and all the places they filmed so I was in heaven. All the wide shots of the landscapes were done for dramatic feel (especially one scene were Alex followed Dan home), not knowing that one day looking back on this would take me to that time and place and make the movie even better after almost thirty years.And thirty years later, it's still one of those movies that people reference when they talk about how looney tunes your significant other can get. Not a bad legacy for it at all.http://cinemagardens.com",Fatal Attraction
55,jadavix,Only worth seeing for Glenn Close,7,20 July 2016,"""Fatal Attraction"" is a fairly humdrum thriller enlivened by Glenn Close's performance as the villain.Its plot is one we've all seen before: married man has an affair with the wrong woman who turns out to be a psycho. He can't ditch her immediately because she might tell his wife, see, so the movie grows out of this trite situation.It also really avoids any real tension. You've probably already heard of the famous ""bunny boiler"" moment. This is actually also pretty trite: animals are always harmed in thrillers as a way to show the villain's increasing capacity for violence. I guess it must have been a shocking moment back in '87, because everybody seems to remember it, but now it's tired.The movie lacks scares, which is either because the filmmaker wasn't capable of providing them, or because he knew that Close could do it through her performance alone.I'm not the first to ask this, but what was it with Michael Douglas and attracting dangerous hotties?

And, is this psycho-stalker movie really supposed to be a stern warning to all married men to not think with their dinks? And, speaking about psycho-stalkers (Hollywood-style), I'd certainly say that Glenn Close, as Alex Forest (aka. The Madame Butterfly of the wrist-slasher set), made for one of the most irritatingly deranged and unintentionally hilarious loony-tunes to ever appear in a big-budget, Tinseltown production that I've ever seen.I honestly can't imagine how Close could've taken her irksome, frizzy-haired character so dead-serious. And the solemn, straight-faced way she delivered her ludicrous lines was just too funny for words.And, speaking about slashing one's wrists - I honestly ask you - When it comes to those people who have ever tried this sort of thing and actually succeeded in gashing open, not one, but both wrists - How many of them do you seriously believe could possibly still remain standing on their own two feet while the blood gushes out of them and (get this!) have the stamina & motivation to go around showing others what they have done? Eh? How many?.... Like, how about none! And, when it finally came down to those noteworthy scenes in Fatal Attraction that totally killed me - I rate the final showdown that took place between dearest Dan & loveliest Alex to be pure slapstick comedy at one of its finest moments.And when darling Dan's battered, bruised & betrayed wife, Beth, got into the act and took perfect aim with the gun and sent that bullet sailing (bull's-eye) dead-center into Alex's heart, well, that was truly a stroke of pure comic genius. Yes. That it was! (Surely there was another bullet in that gun meant for that dick-head, Dan)All-in-all - I guess I got what I expected from Fatal Attraction. There were no surprises here. From it first 5 minutes I knew exactly where this one's story was going.And, with that in mind, do you suppose that the Gallaghers really did live happily ever after?... End of story?

Further, I kept asking myself, ""What are they actually arguing about?"" I also said to myself, ""Who cares?"" A married man and a single woman have sex, the woman gets pregnant and wants to the man to take responsibility and when he brushes her off she gets angry. So what? A man and a woman squabbling! Wow, what an original idea! (I'm trying to be sarcastic.) The producers of this movie use this shallow and unoriginal storyline as a pretext for showing scene after scene of gratuitous violence which is intended to shock and which after a short while becomes so tedious and predictable that it renders the movie almost laughable.

61,drownnnsoda,Deservedly Popular '80s Killer Thriller.,9,13 June 2007,"""Fatal Attraction"" focuses on Dan Gallagher (Michael Douglas), a wealthy New York city attorney with a beautiful wife (Ann Archer) and a wonderful young daughter. He has it all - but his life takes a dark turn after he has a lusty weekend fling with a beautiful client, Alex Forrest (Glenn Close). Dan sees it as nothing more than that, just a fling. But it meant much more to Alex... and soon Dan finds himself being stalked by Alex, and his resistance to continuing their relationship slowly drives her more and more insane, and her antics against Dan and his wife and daughter become increasingly violent... leading to a violent bloodbath (literally) of a finale.Very likely inspired by the 1971 Clint Eastwood thriller, ""Play Misty For Me"", ""Fatal Attraction"" turned out to be one of the most popular movies of the 1980s, and is still referenced and talked about to this day. The plot is fairly straightforward - scorned lover takes revenge on resistant husband. It's been done before, but I can't recall anywhere that it's been done better than it was in this film. The way this premise is presented is wonderfully done and the writing here was excellent. All the dialog was realistic and the characters were believably written. Director Adrian Lyne displays some excellent camera-work as well, creating plenty of hysteria and panic at appropriate times with his quick and jittery shots and angles, and the clever inter-cutting of certain scenes (example being Beth frantically searching for her daughter while Alex rides a roller-coaster with her).The acting here is top-notch, especially from Glenn Close, who gave probably the biggest performance of her career as the mentally unhinged, violent lover who wants sweet revenge (take note that she was nominated for an Oscar as well, and deservedly so). Michael Douglas plays his character well, although he can be hard to sympathize with. Then again, Close's performance makes a good dynamic so this is forgivable. Anne Archer is also very good as Douglas' unsuspecting wife. As for the finale, well what a finale it is! Great conclusion to the story, and a really good thrill to end the film with. A ""bloodbath"" it is, literally.All in all, ""Fatal Attraction"" is an '80s film classic that still holds up well. As been said before, it is likely one of the most talked-about films of all time, and definitely one of the most popular films of it's time. Excellent acting, nice script, and some great thrills. Recommended to anyone who would enjoy a very well-done psycho thriller with themes of lust, obsession, and revenge. 9/10.",Fatal Attraction
62,davispittman,Classic thriller!,10,19 March 2017,"When I think of classic thriller films this one comes to mind every time. ""I won't be ignored Dan"". Remember that chilling like delivered so well by Glenn close?? It's exactly that kind of acting that makes this movie work so well. Glenn close is a force to be reckoned with that's for damn sure, don't believe it? Watch this movie and then get back to me. Her entire performance is just so excellent, from being so welcoming and nice seeming at first to becoming completely obsessive, needy and ultimately completely insane. Michael Douglas is good too, at first you really don't like his character because of his blatant infidelity with Alex (Glenn Close). But then after a while you obviously feel sorry for his character because his family and entire life is being torn apart. I really did like Anne archer too, didn't really think she'd have a very substantial role as Douglas's wife, but her performance really shines and she has some pretty intense scenes that showcase just how good of an actress she is. The movie has excellent writing, especially for Alex, the dialogue shows just how progressively unhinged she becomes. And it also shows Michael Douglas and his progressive desperation and fear. Cooking the rabbit, kidnapping the daughter, and attacking Dan, everything Alex does shows the chill/creepy factor and the feeling the filmmakers are attempting to get across is definitely there. This film is a must see for thriller movie fans. 10/10!",Fatal Attraction
63,gcd70,Frightening and unnerving,7,23 October 2007,"Although it is derivative of Clint Eastwood's ""Play Misty for Me"", Adrian Lyne's ""Fatal Attraction"" is still a very entertaining thriller.The plot finds happily married Dan Gallagher in a very compromising situation after he has a weekend fling with one of his work colleagues. From here on director Lyne begins to create mounting tension which eventually culminates in a terrifying climax. His sense of purpose and control is very impressive.Michael Douglas and Glenn Close are both outstanding, and Anne Archer is also very competent as Mrs. Gallagher. The only disappointment is Maurice Jarre's under used score.Definitely not for the faint hearted, this movie remains frightening and unnerving time and time again. Splendid!Thursday, November 19, 1992 - Video""Fatal Attraction"" will best be remembered as the movie that scared millions of men back to their wives. A superb psychological thriller, this film owes its success to director Adrian Lyne (whose tempo and balance is spot on) and the three lead players.Michael Douglas and Anne Archer are excellent as the Gallaghers, a couple whose marriage is under extreme pressure after hubby's weekend fling. And as Alex, the vengeful mistress in this frightening love triangle, Glenn Close is truly amazing. Downright disturbing cinema.Tuesday, November 2, 1993 - Video",Fatal Attraction
64,MarieGabrielle,The Madame Butterfly reference...,9,13 November 2006,"yes, it is lost (sadly) on mainstream audiences. It is unfortunate the original ending was not utilized, in that it is so much more real, more possible; instead of the violent retribution comeuppance scene.That being said, Adrian Lyne does an excellent job entwining the audience in this madness. Dan (Michael Douglas) is believable, bored with his job as a NY attorney, engaging in (what he thinks) is a meaningless affair. Alex Forrest (Glenn Close) is appropriately neurotic, a single woman in the city who wants to find some connection.All is well at first. Douglas has an affair, then goes home to wife (Anne Archer) and daughter. Eventually they move out of the city to Westchester; a nice haven where nothing can happen. Lyne is excellent in portraying suburbs and the discontent that lies beneath (See also his more recent film, ""Unfaithful"").The Alex character slowly unravels. She is obsessive, and when she realizes she no longer can manipulate Dan (Douglas) she becomes more and more irrational. Supposedly this film was derived from among other themes, the Carolyn Warmus affair.Overall this is an excellent film which has now been re-made ad infinitum. If you like this, you will also enjoy Lyne's ""Unfaithful"" with Diane Lane and Richard Gere. A similar theme and excellent visuals.",Fatal Attraction
65,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Iconic Scenes but Pragmatic Film,7,21 November 2020,"This film I think I first watched in college when I got the movie challenges for free for a bit. It was one I always heard about and felt that I should give a viewing of. Since then, I believe I've seen it a second time with my family when I was visiting with a third viewing with Jaime. The synopsis here is a married man's one-night stand comes back to haunt him when that lover beings to stalk him and his family.We are following a family of three. The father is Dan Gallagher (Michael Douglas) and he's married to Beth (Anne Archer). They're getting ready for a party that night when the babysitter for their daughter Ellen (Ellen Latzen) shows up.They go to the party where they meet up with another married couple of Jimmy (Stuart Pankin) and Hildy (Ellen Foley). Dan is a lawyer for a firm that works with a book publisher. At the party Dan and Jimmy see a blonde woman. Jimmy makes a comment to her and she gives him a dirty look. Later in the Dan goes to the bar and ends up next to her. They hit it off, but she doesn't give him her name. We learn soon after it is Alex Forrest (Glenn Close).Beth and Ellen go out to the country to visit her parents as well as look at house. Beth really wants to move out of New York City. Dan isn't fully on board unless they could find the right place. While they gone, Dan at work runs into Alex. They are both at a meeting about a client and a book she wrote. It is raining outside as they go to leave. His umbrella doesn't open and she joins him on the sidewalk. They try to get a cab and when they can't, he suggests they get drink until it stops. This drink then becomes dinner.They flirt dinner and end up going home together. Despite him being married and her knowing it, they have a weekend affair. She is clearly more interested in him and he tries to break it off. She doesn't get the hint and tries to kill herself. Dan has to decide to keep it a secret and find a way to get her to leave him alone, or to tell his wife. The problem is though; will Alex allow him to leave her? How far will she go to be with him?The first time I watched this film as I said was when I was in college. After that second viewing, I have to say that it wasn't as good as I remember it being. Now with that third viewing, being older and in a different place in my life, I can see different things about it. Watching it with my significant other also makes it more interesting.I still liked this film though, but this what I took away from it. Since story and writing are my favorite things about a movie, I have to say this is good in that department. The concept of this film is something that we could see today. People are having affairs still and this most definitely could happen. The film does hold up in that respect. It is dated in some portions of it coming from 1987 and the technology they are using. That I won't hold against it.What is really driving this movie is the acting. I think the cast was great. Douglas is interesting in my opinion. He loves his wife and family. He is tempted by the forbidden fruit when he is given the opportunity. What makes him really interesting though is that the farther he is pushed we see that he will do whatever it takes to protect what he has. He is selfish like Alex calls him, wanting his cake and eats it too. What I've really come to terms with though is that he's a scumbag. I don't like him at all and I don't enjoy how things end for him.On the other side of this we have Close. She did a great job. I think the role she played was very tough. What I really found interesting about her was that she said in an interview that knowing what we do now, she would have played it differently. She cited the reason being that the character clearly has a mental illness and it could be hurtful to those that are really afflicted with them. I personally am glad that she portrayed the role how she did. It felt like she could really be that character. It is really scary that the more she is ignored, the worse she gets and the things she does get even more terrifying. It is an interesting duality to how put together and strong she seems at first.I did want to commend Archer and Latzen. Archer had a tough role too in that she is in the dark as to what is happening for most of the film. She is faced with a difficult decision of staying with her husband when she learns what he did or keeping the family together. She loses it with Alex after the things she does. I just don't necessarily like where she ends things. I do like what she does though to put an end to this nightmare. Latzen was good being that she is a child and that can be something hard to do to show the emotions she had to portray.The editing of the film was good to me as well. The tension builds as the film goes on, which is what you want from it. I really liked a sequence where Alex takes Ellen to an amusement park and takes her on a rollercoaster. This is paired with Beth trying to find her and the panic setting in. It was well done duality. If I did have an issue, I do think that it runs just a bit too long. There seems to be a bit that could have gotten this down to 100 minutes and it would have been tighter for me.I have added this film to the horror film research due to the fact of how psychotic Alex is and the dread that comes from it for Dan. She does have a mental illness, but she puts Dan's life through hell. He isn't innocent in this though and I felt I needed to point that out. The fear and tension continues to build throughout the film. She does some very horrible things, especially around the climax of this film.With that said, I would recommend giving this film a viewing. The story is one that is still relevant today. Parts of the film are outdated, being that this film came from 1987. The acting is good and they do well to build the tension of the film. I thought the editing was solid for the most part. We get parts where the tension is up, we then think that it is over and then Alex will do something else. The soundtrack outside of one scene didn't stand out, but it also didn't hurt the film. There are films that are more modern retelling of this film, but some of the iconic scenes in this film are worth giving a viewing. I would say to give this film a viewing if you get a chance.",Fatal Attraction

67,triple8,Ann Archer made the movie.,7,29 November 2003,"When I first watched this pic, I loved it. Through the years, I've seen it numerous times on TV and rather then growing on me, it's kind of bored me at times. Still, I think at the time it was a shocking movie, a real scare fest. I've heard that infidelity really did decrease after this came out, though that could just be a rumor. Still, this really isn't a movie without flaws , though the acting was topnotch and is probably the main reason to see the film. It could very easily have been a b movie but Close, Douglass, AND Anne Archer(Especially Archer-she was GREAT) elevate the picture very much.ENDING SPOILERS: The bunny scene I really could have lived without. Also the ending was a cop out(the rising from the tub) , VERY Cliché, stupid actually. I'd have liked them to go more into Alex's background-what made her the way she was? What was she like growing up? Had she done this to others before Douglass? THAT was the biggest disappointment-not knowing a thing about what made this person who she was.And what was with Douglas lying to his wife? When Beth says to him, ""are you in love with her?"" He answers that it was one night. LIE! It was almost 2(part of the next day)-Douglas' character definitely wasn't a TOTAL victim in all this but it WOULD have been nice to have a bit more dialog between the husband and wife though I AM glad it ended happy for Beth.And this movie has been copied shamelessly since it's release-usually unsuccessfully. And who knows, maybe it made at least 1 guy out there refrain from making similar mistakes. So the movie had its good and bad but was SLIGHTLY overrated-though I must admit for some reason I always seem to watch it when it's on. I'd give it a 7.5 maybe an 8.",Fatal Attraction
68,nycritic,Close Personifies A Woman Scorned.,8,23 April 2005,"The back story goes that Glenn Close couldn't do sexy to save her life. She, of course, being the great actress she is, set herself out to prove her detractors wrong, and has gone down in history for having single-handedly made ""love in an elevator"" a household name and something horny lovers would look forward to, especially in a semi-deserted building after hours. Never dressed in anything other than black or white (in a nod to Lana Turner's own femme fatale wardrobe in THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE), and with long, curly hair enhancing her cold, Connecticut looks, she lights up the screen in her hotly sensual, sympathetic introduction, and just as the black she wears later on as she turns into the psycho she really is, makes the audience completely hate her -- so of course, killing her off was in order to please the crowd who despite having the logics of plot thrown out the window demanded her death in a steamy bathtub at the hands of Anne Archer. That's the power of acting, people. She is the film down to its illogical but emotionally satisfying ending, and anything else is just a false 80s ""family values"" hogwash.

For Dan the romance is but a short-lived fling carrying little weight and no consequential remorse, but obsessively enchanted Alex sees more to their relationship. After incessant phone-calls Dan becomes increasingly guilt-ridden, but the situation quickly becomes aggravated when Alex proclaims to him that she is pregnant...""Fatal Atrraction"" had a significant commercial pull in the 1980s as a non-relenting psychological thriller with several severe scenes falling into memory and one even coining the phrase 'bunny-boiler'. From the erotic thriller factory of Adrian Lyne it deals out unforgiving reactions and believable build-up with tense scenes delivering a sense of dread, but simultaneously suggesting a comment on marital infidelity. An important element here is Dan's guilt, which isn't exactly resulting from moral quagmires, but from blow-back, feelings forced onto him by the discharged lover. As long as consequences are kept hidden Dan feels little remorse for his indiscretion, suggesting that such behaviour only causes afterthought when it threatens to be revealed. Even then the innocent threat of revelation is first met with negation and aggression, while the acceptance of responsibility ultimately comes only after Alex personally harms his family. On the other spectrum we have Alex, deeply emotional and essentially troubled, but requiring some sort of repercussions for Dan in order to settle the score.However Adrian Lyne's movie goes down south pretty tragically, apparently due to bad feedback from test audiences. The psychologically sound ending portraying Alex's self-inflicted downhill spiral ending in suicide, was since supplanted with a ridiculous horror movie cliché of a murderous woman out for blood. Collapsing the whole credibility of the movie in search for commercial appeal with its expectedly dire culmination ""Fatal Attractions"" still comes off strong through great portrayals by Close, Archer and Douglas, but ultimately underwhelming due to its cheated Hollywood finale. Douglas's character ends up not suffering any punishment for his part in the ordeal, simply being taken back into the loving arms of his deceived wife.",Fatal Attraction
70,PredragReviews,"""Use the bed, not the sink you dirty sod!""",9,21 January 2017,"A white-knuckled ""don't-let-this-happen-to-you"" thriller that vividly demonstrates what can happen to a guy when he lets other parts of his anatomy do his thinking for him. Manhattan lawyer Dan Callagher (Mike Douglas) has it all: successful career, attractive wife, nice dog, an d a loving daughter. So why not have an extramarital fling with a woman he met at a party while the family is out of town? Sure. Just a one-night stand. No harm, no harm done. But there's something very nasty about Dan's partner in crime, because blonde Alex Forrest (Glenn Close) may have all the right moves in the sack, but she also has an elevator that doesn't go all the way to the top. So when Dan wants to shake hands and part company, Alex will have none of it, and the table is set for a one-way ticket to Looney Land...The moral is very simple: human beings are fragile. Leading on a single female as Dan Gallagher does in this movie can result in drastic consequences. Human beings are controlled by emotions: laughter, sadness, etc... Therefore, someone in Dan Gallagher's position must realize that inviting a single young lady to a tête-à-tête in a restaurant harbors relief to her solitude and brings her into a fantasy-life. On the other hand, Alex Forrest is attractive, relatively young, cultured, and intelligent. She definitely will find someone, but I still understand her reluctance to let Dan go.

72,oneguyrambling,"If you boil water and give the psycho a rabbit, don't expect a good outcome for the rabbit.",5,7 November 2010,"Michael Douglas doesn't ever seem to get a lot of credit for his acting, it seems that he is simply ""there"" and has been ""there"" for the better part of 3 decades. Put more simply, there are many Pacino fans, many De Niro fans, I myself am a Bruce Willis and Jackie Chan fan, and I acknowledge the justification for Stallone, Schwarzenegger and even Van-Damme fans. It takes all types to make a world. Don't know too many who proclaim themselves die-hard Mickey D fans though.Well after watching Fatal Attraction for the very first time on the weekend I can say that Douglas was r-o-b-b-e-d of an Oscar for this performance, as acting like Glenn Close really got him fired up is one of the strongest acting jobs in history. Seriously Glenn Close in this film is pug-ugly, this film was released over 20 years ago and she looks more attractive now than she did wayyyy back then, more like ""Inexplicable Attraction"" zzzzzzinggggggg! Nowadays if they remade this film I discussed with my wife just who would play a credible version of Alex that might make a plausible enough threat to a happy hubby. We came up with a few 40 somethings, Aniston, Berry, Hayek and Bullock, and I came up with 100s of 20 somethings and several dozen 30 somethings before my wife told me to stop, more than once as I recall. Surely there must have been a few going around 20 years ago??? But seriously folks, there is a joke that might apply here: Q – ""What is the difference between a dog and a fox?"" A – ""8 beers."" Glenn Close as Alex is at least an 8 beers with a bottle of scotch chaser, and you'd still regret your poor judgment.I think I have made some sort of point there.Mickey is Dan, a lawyer married to Beth. They have a little girl about 6 called Ellen and a dog called Quincy. All is well in the house, Dan's career seems to be going gangbusters and they are contemplating a big move out of the city into the peace and quiet of the sticks. In Dan's working existence he comes across Alex a couple of times, and when the wife and kid go away from the weekend they share a drink, some frank discussion and afterwards some bodily fluids. Lots of bodily fluids if you're at all interested. (Too much if you ask me.) OK so Dan was drunk and stupid and made a heeeuge lapse in good judgment, (just massive, remember the ugliness?). But for some reason he sobers up and thinks ""yeah let's do that again."" So the next night is spent as nothing less than a date, dancing, drinking and more naked ridiculousness.Dan what were you thinking???...She looks like Courtney Love!...After a bender!!!...So Dan takes the morning walk of shame home, checks in with the wife and hopefully slits his wrists, wait no he doesn't Alex calls him, babbles like a baby when he tells her it was just a stupid, stupid, stupid mistake on his part, and get this: DAN GOES ON TO COMFORT ALEX! Dan you are married to a nice wife, have a young daughter and Alex is a psycho!! I know to make the movie work she needs to be a bit crackers but surely as the film goes on and she goes from a Level 1 Psycho, up through the levels (I ultimately had her around a 6, one more than the Astronaut with a nappy but one less than Jennifer Lopez on a good day) Dan doesn't have to get stupider? Dan starts as a nice guy and by going back to her he is no less than a Level 4 Idiot himself and is partially responsible for his own predicament.Moving on.The movie is an accurate ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" story, only if at the end of every section Dan takes the option that is obviously the most ludicrous.I am sure that there are many crazy women (and men) out there that might go to the bizarre lengths that Alex goes to, (and slitting their wrists in grief after the most brief encounter sounds bizarre to me) but for Dan to take the steps that he takes only aids her wacky crusade, and basically leads him into the situation that he finds himself in.I like a good drama, I like a good thriller, can't say that I am a massive fan of either genre, and not enough to put up with illogical over the top nonsense as this.My moral: If you boil the pot of water and give the psycho a rabbit, don't expect a good outcome for the rabbit.Final Rating – 5.5 / 10. Yes OK this kind of thing might happen. But anyone who actually falls for this preposterous, over-the-top nonsense is perhaps dumb enough that it might happen to them.

73,seymourblack-1,"Adultery, Jealousy & Revenge",8,9 October 2012,"This movie about adultery, jealousy and a spurned woman's relentless pursuit of revenge is genuinely unforgettable and compelling to watch. It's definitely a movie of its time which connected strongly with audiences when it was first released and also seemed to tap into certain attitudes that were starting to become more prevalent in society at that time. The values associated with the permissiveness of earlier years were gradually being left behind and this movie's depiction of the dangerous consequences of indulging in casual affairs seemed to be a strong endorsement of this change.The impact and influence of this great box office success has continued to be significantly stronger than would normally be expected as it has successfully maintained its popularity over the years and even been responsible for the term ""bunny boiler"" becoming a universally recognised part of the language. Amusingly, 25 years after the movie's release, when Aerosmith's Steven Tyler announced his decision to leave ""American Idol"" to return to his band (which was his ""first love""), he added ""I've decided it's time to for me to let go of my mistress before she boils my rabbit"".Dan Gallagher (Michael Douglas) is a successful, happily married Manhattan lawyer who meets book editor Alex Forrest (Glenn Close) when he does some work for her employers. One weekend, when his wife Beth (Anne Archer) and daughter Ellen (Ellen Hamilton Latzen) are out of town visiting his in-laws, he and Alex have a short but very passionate affair which he quickly decides to end but Alex is in no mood to agree.Alex initially reacts by slitting her wrists and later goes on to harass Dan by calling in at his office and later continuing to make telephone calls to him on his work number. When he tells his secretary that he's not prepared to take any more of these calls, Alex reacts by telephoning his home at all hours of the day and night and then even poses as a prospective buyer of his apartment to show her determination to make him take responsibility for his actions.Alex continues to terrorise Dan and his family by pouring acid on his car, kidnapping his daughter, boiling Ellen's pet rabbit and physically threatening Beth before the story eventually reaches its violent climax.Michael Douglas is very convincing as Dan who seems to have achieved his success so easily that he takes his comfortable lifestyle and happy marriage for granted. He's a man who, in a moment of weakness makes a bad decision and very soon after, regrets what he's done. His betrayal of his loyal wife and his inability to confess until he's forced to, are reprehensible and indirectly put his family in great danger.Glenn Close is genuinely scary in a very accomplished performance in which she shows the various facets of Alex's personality with such skill that she really makes her character's changeable and unhinged behaviour seem understandable. Anne Archer is also perfect in her part and the scene in which she learns of her husband's infidelity is extremely touching as she retains her dignity magnificently despite her obvious pain.""Fatal Attraction"" is an attention grabbing title which is reminiscent of the classic film noir titles which also frequently alluded to death, danger, fear or entrapment and just like those films, this movie features flawed characters, aberrant behaviour and plenty of suspense.",Fatal Attraction

75,TheUnknown837-1,a thriller that Hitchcock would have admired,10,20 July 2010,"""Fatal Attraction"" is the sort of thriller that Alfred Hitchcock would have admired, and probably would have made had the censors of his time allowed him to do so. It attacks its characters, and its audience, psychologically as well as viscerally, it makes you think about the people in it, it terrifies and haunts you, and it contends with the themes of lust and betrayal. It's a tremendously sweeping psychological thriller with some true tension and some marvelous performances that even still haunts me with its images and situations. And apparently I'm not the only one, for Glenn Close has stated many times that husbands had written her thank-you notes, claiming that her performance in the film saved their marriages. If you're interested in how, read further.The movie stars Michael Douglas in one of his finest performances as a married lawyer who one weekend, while his wife and daughter are visiting relatives in the country, commits a lusty sin by engaging in an extramarital affair with a sexy but sadistic woman played with astonishing conviction by the great Glenn Close. The one-night stand turns into a nightmare as Close becomes increasingly obsessive and compulsive with Douglas, even to the point of stalking him and his family. Douglas, fearing for his marriage and the lives of his family, scrambles to end his relationship with Close, which turns to the worse.""Fatal Attraction"" is a psychologically solid movie that treats its themes of adultery and lust with conviction and power. That's just one thing I admired. In many other movies, I have grown increasingly tired of seeing pointless sex scenes, preferring it when the filmmakers merely suggest an errotic moment and leave it up to the imaginations of the audience to fill in the void. But her, it's different. The sex scenes, which are visceral and concupiscent, do not turn on the audience, but instead appall them. We don't cheer or become errotic, but drop our jaws and immediately start fearing the worst.But that's just one tiny element I admired. It's what followed afterward that I really found effective. First of all, we have two very solid characters, developed into rounded-out human beings that we can come to associate ourselves with and, even in the case of the Glenn Close character, who is psychotic and a threat to others as well as herself, care about. At times, we identify more with her than we do with Michael Douglas, who is our protagonist. As we discover later in the movie, Close is as much a victim of this affair as Douglas is. She's not a monster; she's a human being with feelings, who is hurting and being torn apart by the aftereffects of this intended one-night stand.The aftereffects of the affair become increasingly suspenseful long before any lives are really in danger. As Hitchcock proved to us in his masterpieces, suspense can be achieved even without any lives placed in peril. A lot of tension develops as Douglas fights to keep the affair a secret from his wife and child, and from everybody else if he can manage, and he performs some very sane decisions instead of acting stupid like so many other people do in so many other thrillers. The tension also mounts as development is spawned by the performance of Anne Archer as Douglas's wife.""Fatal Attraction"" was directed by Adrian Lyne and it is a technically smooth movie as well as a brilliant one. The art-direction, the cinematography, the lighting, the misc en scene, everything is fabulous. The movie is great to look at as well as experience. Now some people have complained about the ending, which is considered a cop-out. And if Hitchcock had been allowed to make a movie like this, he probably would have avoided the ending that was the chosen one of two alternatives to end this story. However, though understanding the detractors, I think the end works. It works for me on the same grounds that the even more controversial ending of Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece ""Apocalypse Now"" did. The movie as a whole is brilliant, brutal, intense, and wonderfully acted. Michael Douglas should have been nominated for his role and Glenn Close and Anne Archer were well-deserving of their Academy Award nominations, as was everybody else who was mentioned on the rosters that night. It's an iconic thriller that will live on forever.",Fatal Attraction
76,film-critic,"You play fair with me, I'll play fair with you.",7,14 January 2005,"For 1987, this was a decent little thriller that definitely showcased the amazing talent of Glenn Close. If you were hesitant to see this film, I would suggest it to you for the sheer enjoyment of seeing Close out of her element and being as sultry as ever. Douglas plays the classic, not to creative, father/husband/lover that must battle a barrage of threats coming from a woman that deserves every bit of respect from him. The script is jagged, at times nearly laughable, but still an enjoyable two hours of some amazingly tense scenes handled well by Adrian Lyne, who continues to ""wow"" us with his beautiful vision and racy talent behind the camera with film favorites like Unfaithful and Jacob's Ladder (two completely different films that highlight his true talent). I also think that the premise to this story is something to tote about as well. It is one of those rare occurrences when you could see the honesty of the story. It is an everyday occurrence, husbands cheating on their wives, and the reality that one could just ""snap"" after a night of sheer pleasure connects with such a mass viewing audience. Fatal Attraction is one of those films that creates the tension from the reality of the crime or passion, which is scarier than any horror film out there.The greatest pull for this film has to be Glenn Close. I have seen several of her films and I must admit that this one sent shivers up my spine. She was superb as the strong-willed woman who knew what she wanted, went for it, then sought her revenge when the man wasn't able to reciprocate the feelings back to her. She really gave some depth to this film, transforming what could have been this simple psychotic character into one with many layers and depth. There are times that you somewhat feel sorry for her character because of the way that Douglas' character has treated her. While some will say that she forced him into it, Douglas knew what he was doing from the beginning, and should have been ready for any of the consequences. I will also say that I think Close's portrayal of Alex is a very feminist one. She could have easily decided to portray her as this weak and disturbed woman, but instead I really saw her as this independent woman who wasn't going to be walked away from after a weekend of love. Her heart was not going to be cut out and handed to her just because she was just as aggressive as most men. I was very impressed with Close in this film. All the while I thought Douglas was not coming out of his box. He brought nothing spectacular to his role and in fact I found myself laughing whenever he was to portray being flustered. It just didn't fit him. The same goes for Archer who played a cookie-cutter wife with no emotion. I feel that she was probably the worst character of the film. Apparently the writers gave her no information on her character and the only direction that Lyne gave her was to ""act pretty"". What a waste of talent. Finally, what was up with the boy-ish looking daughter they had? To me, that was one of the more frightening elements of this film.Outside of the characters, Lyne does a fantastic job of building suspense and tension between Douglas and Close. He consistent and powerful use of the phone to add that extra ""violin shrill"" was a blast. I jumped a little bit each time the phone rang in the film, which showed the power that Lyne had with this household devise. He also structured the story well, giving us just the right amount of space and time with each of our players. He didn't focus heavy on just Douglas, but jumped us back and forth with Close as well allowing us to see different perspectives and development. My only struggle with the structure of the film was the ""why"" for Douglas. Was it pure spontaneity to sleep with Close, or was there some tensions or troubles at home? I would have liked to understand a bit clearer as to why Douglas decided to destroy his seemingly perfect family.Overall, I was impressed with this film. While I do not think that it was exceptionally good, I do credit it for keeping my attention during the two hours that it ran. I literally could not keep my eyes off Close. She was amazing in this film, and if you see it for no other reason than her performance, you will not be disappointed. It was a classic ""every man"" story that included that Lyne atmosphere of tension and erotica. The script could have used some tweaking, but the intensity was there. I couldn't answer my phone for a week after I watched this. Fatal Attraction was not a bad little thriller for the feminist in all of us.Grade: *** out of *****",Fatal Attraction
77,mattymatt4ever,Tons of suspense! Tons of fun! Erotic thriller at its finest!,9,30 May 2002,"After seeing ""Unfaithful,"" I was curious about this movie, being that it was also directed by Adrian Lyne and received much acclaim from critics and audiences.  Well, all that hype was well-deserved.  I rented the Special Edition DVD and it was a delight!  I couldn't stop the disc, even to go to the bathroom, because I couldn't wait to see what would happen next.  Of course, the premise alone is intriguing.  The plot is full of interesting twists and turns.  But all in all, the actors make it work. 
Michael Douglas doesn't miss a beat in the role he was born to play.  I like how he's suave and likable, yet in his own way flawed.  I always love seeing Douglas on screen, he just has an intense screen presence, but this was his best performance.  Glenn Close couldn't have been a better choice as Alex. This was my first time seeing the movie, so when I heard that Glenn Close was playing a femme fetale my first impression was ""Huh?""  First of all, she's not the most attractive woman on earth.  She's an incredible actress, but has a long nose like Meryl Streep.  Yet she manages to be sexy and seductive in this role, and now that I've seen the film I can honestly say they couldn't have picked a better actress.  She manages to play a cold-blooded wench with great intensity, yet never going over-the-top.  You still feel a fair degree of sympathy for her, which is another great thing about this movie.  At most times you feel sympathy for Douglas, but at certain times you also feel sympathy for her.  For example, when he confronts her at the loft, she says, ""You think you can just use me, like a slut you can just bang and then throw away?""  At that moment, you think to yourself, ""OK, the crazy b*tch has a point.""  After all, he cheated on his beautiful wife.  He ain't no angel himself.  But then I thought back to the conversation the two of them had at the restaurant in the beginning, where they both agreed that they would be discreet.  And though you can't feel sympathy for a woman who terrorizes Douglas's loving family the way she did, you understand the thoughts behind her actions.  Anyway, back to Glenn Close, I felt her performance couldn't have been any better and she deserved an Oscar for Best Actress.  Her role could've been easily hammed up by a lesser actress.  Plus, I love when she screams at Douglas, ""I'm not gonna be ignored, Dan!""  That line should go down in history.  Adrian Lyne's direction is slick and stylish, the acting is brilliant and the story is one of the most suspenseful and intriguing of its kind.  As for the ending, I felt it was a little conventional, but it went along with the flow of the story.  The original ending was very well-written, but it would've worked better in a more mellow film.  While you're on the edge of your seat, you prefer a more exciting climax.  My score:  9 (out of 10)",Fatal Attraction
78,TOMASBBloodhound,Solid thriller overcomes a few ridiculous scenes.,7,2 January 2012,"As far as big box office hits from the late 1980s go, this one is not bad at all. Fatal Attraction is a stylish, suspenseful, and in many cases plausible thriller that was perhaps a wake-up call to cheating husbands of the time. Michael Douglas plays a young yuppie lawyer who seems happily married with a pretty wife and daughter. At a trendy 80s Japanese-themed sushi/cocktail party, he casually hits on an attractive (well, kinda attractive for that time) woman played by Glenn Close. She happens to work for a publisher that his firm represents. Shortly after, his wife and kids leave the city for the weekend. Douglas and Close end up hooking up after a Saturday office meeting. They pretty much have sex the entire weekend. Nobody did angry, aggressive sex scenes like Michael Douglas. His breathy couplings with Close probably won him the parts in Basic Instinct and Disclosure, too. Some of them are somewhat elaborate involving elevators, pots and pans, water... maybe these were outtakes from 9 1/2 weeks which had the same director. I guess for the 1980s they were hot. Now we don't even get sex scenes in most movies, so maybe we should treasure these. Anyway, Douglas knows he screwed up, and just wants to forget the whole thing. Close, on the other hand is possessive, clearly crazy, and has no intention of letting Douglas go on his merry way. She begins calling his home and office relentlessly, stalking him and his family, and even tracking them upstate to their new home in the country. The more he tries to get clear of her, the crazier she becomes.... and the more this screenplay jumps the rails. Oh, and she claims to be pregnant with his child, too.The film is just too well-crafted to turn away from. It is beautifully photographed, well-paced, and suspenseful when it needs to be. Director Lyne also knows how to handle smaller, and subtler moments. Notice the scenes where Douglas just watches his wife and child interact as mommy and child often do. Whether reading a story, or practicing for a school play these moments are enough to remind him what is at stake due to his fooling around. The conclusion, which was re-shot as the original one failed with test audiences, is generally satisfying. Even if it feels a little too violent and out of place with most of the rest of the film.The film loses points with some truly incredulous scenes that are just way too improbable and are more of a distraction. These would involve the boiling of a pet rabbit, and an inexplicable trip to an amusement park by Close and the little girl while her mother frantically drives around town looking for her. Some bright staff they must have at the girl's school! And I was also struck by a quick shot of a handgun in a desk drawer at the Douglas home. True, their lives are in danger, but a loaded handgun in a desk drawer where their child could easily find it? Gun owners like this make it hard for the rest of us who do it safely. The whole movie is worth about 7 of 10 stars. It was a major money-maker back in the day.The Hound.",Fatal Attraction
79,Hollywood_Yoda,Never Scorn a Crazy Woman,8,29 February 2016,"This film goes to prove you must never scorn a crazy woman, or better yet, don't have an affair with her! Glenn Close plays the part so well, as the villainous other woman. And Michael Douglas as the cheating husband rounds the cast out well. It's like he wasn't even playing the part.Adrian Lyne should have won an Oscar for his direction of this classic psychological thriller. Hard to believe that in six nominations, not a single win. Wow!!The only part of the film that was more disturbing than Alex cutting her wrists insanely was the rabbit sequence. Could have done without seeing that.Overall, a very under appreciated film. Great story.",Fatal Attraction
80,tbills2,Fatal Attraction Stars Fatally Attractive Stars Michael Douglas & Glenn Close!!,7,13 May 2018,"Fatal Attraction is one of the very best dual-performance driven movies of any decade, including the '80s, and one of the sexiest too, because of Michael and Glenn, Close and Douglas that is, just like Basic Instinct! This is maybe the best dual-performance acting ever by opposing sexes! (ESotSM with Jim and Kate?) They're both acting so exquisitely in it it lifts the caliber of the written content making the film. Glenn is drop dead gorgeous in it with her deadly figure and even more lethal look and Michael is fatally sexy too. I love Fatal Attraction; it basically attracts a basic resemblance to Basic Instinct because of the Michael Douglas factor and Close's alluring and lustful murderous co-lead. I love Anne Archer and she's seriously sexy too, dead seriously sexy.",Fatal Attraction
81,gab-14712,Glenn Close Delivers a Performance You'll Never Forget!,8,21 January 2021,"Adrian Lyne's erotic thriller Fatal Attraction is a fun, horrifying film about a predatory, neurotic woman bent on destroying one man's life. The first two-thirds of the movie is a fun insight of the psychology behind the damaged woman's advances. The final third, while still watchable and entertaining at times, turns into Friday the 13th. The ending has shock value, but perhaps not for the best reasons. Alex Forrest, one of the cinema's best villains, turned into a psychopathic murderer after some unforgivable actions such as boiling the pet bunny alive and kidnapping the six-year-old daughter and scaring her with a rollercoaster. While entertainment value is top notch for these scenes, the message is unclear. I wanted more of a psychological thriller of the first two-thirds. That said, the movie still rocks. This is one of the few erotic thrillers I did enjoy, so hats off to the team behind the feature. The performances, especially from Glenn Close, are excellent. The setup and the rising tension/dread is captured well and realistically by screenwriter James Dearden. Maurice Jarre composed the score, and I really liked his subtle, yet bone-chilling score.
Dearden had done a short film in 1980 with a very similar story, and he was charged with adapting the film to a bigger, longer Hollywood production. Nicholas Meyer was then hired to do rewrites including the ending, which made the film a huge box office success. Adrian Lyne, the man who knows how to direct films about erotic passion and sex, was then hired to direct. Originally, producers Stanley R. Jaffe and Sherry Lansing did not agree with Close as Alex Forrest. They felt like she was not sexual enough for the role. When she flew in to do a reading with Michael Douglas, she changed her looks to make her a bit unhinged. She thought she miserably failed the audition, and her career was ruined, but the producers realized they found exactly who they were looking for. I agree because Glenn Close absolutely nailed this role and created one of the most memorable villains in recent cinema history.
Dan Gallagher (Michael Douglas) seems to have the perfect, happy life. He works as a corporate lawyer for a publishing company. He is happily married to his wife, Beth (Anne Archer) and they have a six-year-old daughter. When his family leaves town for the weekend, Dan meets Alex Forrest (Glenn Close), an associate editor at one of Dan's client's agencies. Despite Dan's happiness, they seemingly decide to have a one-night stand and Dan makes it clear there are no strings attached because he is married. That does not sit well with Alex because she decided that she likes him and wants to be a part of his life. She will do anything to make it happen. She might have to be passive aggressive and if Dan does not comply, she might take necessary steps to keep him in his life.
Glenn Close is a fantastic actress and despite initial concerns that she would not be able to pull off this role, she really did. Her character is a psychology study all on its own. While her final scenes, despite being entertaining, go over-the-top, Close's acting merged with Dearden's screenplay to create something authentic. Watching Close transform into her character is terrifying. Regardless of what you think of the movie, Close's performance is the best part. She is leagues better than Michael Douglas who isn't so bad himself. His character and his intentions certainly made me angry. Anne Archer has some excellent scenes as Douglas's wife. She is the glue that holds the family together and she will take the necessary steps to ensure that.
Fatal Attraction is one of those films that begins as a slight slimmer but ends on an overdone boil. That is not necessarily a bad thing as Adrian Lyne keeps the film competent and entertaining throughout. The ending is memorable thanks to its Friday the 13th antics. I did not hate the ending but felt it could have been out of place. Still, the film manages to give you some frightening chills. If you ever think about cheating on your spouse, perhaps you need to think twice after giving this thrilling feature a watch. Who knows who can be a psychopath? Lyne gave himself a name with erotic thrillers and this is one of them to watch. Ending be darned, this is a good, entertaining popcorn stuffer.

84,Vivekmaru45,The Story Of Michael Douglas's Life I Expect...,6,21 January 2014,"This has got to be one of the most controversial film to be made. I read somewhere a review saying, ""They can't stop talking about this film"".The film deals with a married man Dan Gallagher (Michael Douglas), a successful New York attorney who has a weekend affair with Alexandra ""Alex"" Forrest (Glenn Close), an editor for a publishing company. After the affair is over, Alex refuses to forget him, first harasses and later stalks him. The title of the movie is Fatal Attraction. You can immediately put two and two together and know that something quite dangerous and dramatic will occur at a point in the film.I'm not one to preach, but the character portrayed by Douglas's character is a cad, through and through. This man uses a woman for sex gratification and then dumps her like eating banana and throwing the skin away. My sympathy rather was with Close's character which was of a woman starved for affection, who forms a bond with her man. However she refuses to be dumped and this leads to friction and tension between the two main characters of the film. The other actress in the film is Anne Archer who played memorable roles in films like: Green Ice (1981), Narrow Margin (1990), Patriot Games (1992) and Clear and Present Danger (1994). She plays Beth Gallagher, Dan's wife. Not to forget the excellent Fred Gwynne(The Munsters, Pet Cemetery) who plays a cameo role in the film. This film has an alternate ending which appeared on a special edition VHS and LaserDisc release by Paramount in 1992, and was included on the film's DVD release a decade later.Verdict: As a thriller the film fails(I think the background music effects and score are below par). As a controversial film this one is right there among the best of them. Try to rent this one out before you think about buying it and also remember to rent the DVD with the alternate ending. Similar themed films: Out Of Africa (1985), American Beauty (1999), Eyes Wide Shut (1999), The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008).",Fatal Attraction
85,Maziun,"Flawed , but quite nice drama/thriller",6,16 November 2013,"*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERSThe idea of one person stalking the other and slowly destroying someone's life was made before in ""Possessed"" (1947) and ""Play Misty for me"" (1971) , but ""Fatal attraction"" is the movie most known for general audience. It was quite a box office success and it's quite a classic even now after all those years.It's often been called an erotic thriller , but I think it's more of a thriller/drama . It's certainly deeper than ""Basic instinct"". By the way it's the first movie in Michael Douglas ""victim of evil woman"" trilogy (the other are ""Basic instinct"" and ""Disclosure"") . Glenn Close, Sharon Stone and Demi Moore – Douglas is one lucky guy. The fact thatDouglas betrays Archer with Close (who isn't really that attractive) is a stretch , but stranger things happen in real life.Glenn Close gives the performance of lifetime as Alex Forrest - outwardly gorgeous woman who is emotionally unstable and switches from hysteria to aggression. She's fantastic and it's a shame that she didn't won the Oscar. In her shadow is lovely Anne Archer great as the loving mother and wife. She deserved Oscar nominee. Last , but not least there is Michael Douglas with his effective performance , beautifully conveying increasing angst and guilt.""Fatal attraction"" is well directed by Adrian Lyne (""Flashdance"") . The erotic scenes are steamy , the dramatic scenes are poignant and the scenes of violence are actually disturbing. I really admire Lyne for his solid direction that carries the movie despite it's flaws.The screenplay is actually quite predictable and isn't afraid to use some cliché scary tactics (the mirror scene , the rabbit scene) . There is also problem with ending . It is exciting for sure, but kinda stupid too. How did Close got into the house ? The doors and windows were closed and it's hard to imagine that neither Douglas , Archer or the dog haven't noticed her. Also was she some metahuman since she survived Douglas strangling her under water ? The alternate ending would fit the movie much better – read about it on the internet.Thankfully the idea on which the movie is based feels very real . Something like could happen in real life to anyone . The screenplay gives a surprising and subtle clues which explain why she acts like a psycho.Unlike most thrillers this one has something to say and spawned many discussions. It's a story about American dream , monogamy , motherhood, lifestyle of single woman . Alex character could be a metaphor for AIDS and a castration of ""safe affair"" dream. After all those years ""Fatal attraction"" is still a thriller worth watching . I give it 6/10.",Fatal Attraction
86,RonellSowes,Not Quite A Classic But A Solid Thriller,6,12 July 2021,"Probably the one of, if not the, primary reasons this film worked is because Glenn Close is such a compelling villain, and that's why she got the role. However, as good as she might be at the fatal part, I don't think anyone was actually taking the 'attraction' into account.But even with those shortcomings she's still a great fit for the part in many other ways, and once it comes to the suspense and conflict she keeps the movie rolling.By no means does the picture always make the most logical choice, but it does stay moving and keeps the problems for Douglas' character consistent and increasing. In some ways, you can say Michael Douglas gives a better performance than Close, because he manages to retain the audience's sympathies on his side despite acting immoral and stupid(though it also might have to do with the fact that he's a recognizable movie star).Fatal Attraction is a film that upon release succeeded in almost every way possible. It was one of the top grossing films of the year, nominated for six Academy Awards-including Best Picture-and had a less measurable cultural impact as well. Since then its definetly declined in status, but while it isn't too much of a 'classic', it's still remains a solid thriller and superior to many of the imitations it launched.",Fatal Attraction

89,Christian_Dimartino,"A forest to stay out of, if you catch my drift.",9,24 June 2013,"I don't know about you, but I love a good, psychotic, sexual thriller. I mean, I am a huge admirer of the ""so bad it's good"" film, Wild Things. That is a guilty pleasure, and i'm not even guilty about it. That movie is the king daddy of sexual thrillers. But, in second place, a movie that is probably better, is Adrian Lynne's intoxicating 1987 Best Picture nominee, Fatal Attraction. Sure, the movie is insane and over-the-top. But that's just what makes it so good.The film revolves around a hard working family man named Dan (Michael Douglas, who won an Oscar the same year for Wall Street). One weekend, while his wife (Anne Archer in an Oscar nominated role) and kids are out of town, he has sex with a mysterious temp named Alex Forest (Glenn Close in an Oscar nominated role). As he tries to move on with his life, she desperately tries to get him back. And she will really stop at nothing to see him again.If you haven't seen this movie and it sounds familiar, that is probably because you saw 2009's Obsessed. But this movie is a lot better than that one. This one is a lot sexier, crazier, and more dangerous. Also, the acting isn't as irritating. Now, don't get me wrong, you certainly want to murder Alex. But that's what makes Close's performance work so well.Close is amazing. Here, she gives one of her best performances. Now, I have never exactly found Glenn Close sexy, but it is obvious just why she was chosen. It's because she's amazing in this movie. She is mysterious, she is bonkers, and you really can't take your eyes off of her. I loved Cher's performance in Moonstruck, but I still have to say that the Oscar should have gone to Close.Fatal Attraction isn't a great movie. I think that whoever wrote it (and, basically, any other movie where an obsessive woman goes insane) is slightly sexist. But it doesn't matter. Fatal Attraction is extremely entertaining. It is definitely a wild ride, and it may not have worked without Close. She beat out plenty of incredibly sexy actresses for the role. Just watch it, and you'll see why.A-",Fatal Attraction
90,Isaac5855,"For my money, the Best Picture of 1987....",9,15 February 2007,"FATAL ATTRACTION was the surprise smash hit of 1987 that filled theaters and terrified men all over the country contemplating adultery. This instant classic starred Michael Douglas as Dan Gallagher, a lawyer with a great job, a beautiful wife (Anne Archer), and an adorable daughter who risks it all by having a weekend fling with one Alex Forrest (Glenn Close), an associate from work, while his wife and daughter have gone away for the weekend. When Monday morning rolls around, Dan wants to resume his normal life but Alex is having none of that and is soon revealed to be a dangerous psychopath who refuses to let Dan just walk out of her life. Probably the most talked about movie of 1987, this film tells a compelling story and teaches a lesson without being preachy, basically that actions have consequences and some must just be endured because they have been brought upon ourselves. Despite a somewhat cliché-ridden screenplay, this movie works thanks to vivid direction by Adrian Lyne and first-rate performances. Close is bone-chilling as Alex Forrester and despite the fact that he is an adulterer, Michael Douglas manages to infuse some semblance of sympathy into Dan. Dan made his bed, so to speak, but Douglas still manages to make us care about and fear for Dan. Anne Archer delivers the best performance of her career as Dan's wife, Beth, the real victim in this whole mess. Close and Archer were both nominated for Oscars, but lost to Cher and Olympia Dukakis for MOONSTRUCK. Close definitely should have won. The film was also nominated for Best Director, Adrian Lyne and Best Picture. Twenty years later, this film remains riveting from start to finish and it amazes me how different this film turned out to be from the producers' original vision. Alex was originally going to played by a sexy young starlet and many actresses were offered the role prior to Close and now I can't imagine anyone as Alex but Close...the performance is perfection. Brian DePalma was originally slated to direct but bowed out because he felt Michael Douglas was wrong for the role of Dan and would not evoke sympathy from the audience. C0-producer Sherry Lansing said those fears were quashed during the first audience preview of the film during the scene when Dan comes home and messes up his bed to make it look like he had slept in it. Apparently, this scene produced cheers from the crowd and the audience loved Dan from there on.

91,sashank_kini-1,One of the time-capsule movies that should've been discarded by the 90s,2,26 February 2012,"Alfred Hitchcock created Psycho in the 60s and it has achieved legendary status. People expecting a scream-fest will be disappointed at first as it is replete with extended dialogs between the characters. It is more a thriller than a horror, but because the much talked-about 'Shower Scene' that has been ranked in many ""Scariest Scenes in History"" lists, those who haven't seen the movie presume that it is a horror movie. The movie ultimately will make you sweat with fear but won't make you scream as if bitten by a Sumatran rat-monkey, and some don't realize this but the filmmaker has succeeded in his attempt to invoke fear in your mind. On my first viewing, even I was quite disillusioned by the movie; it only improved on my subsequent viewings. Curse the ""Scariest Scenes in History"" list for creating that presumption. In fact, Oscar Awards create a different presumption about films – we expect a certain class and when the films, especially those nominated for the Best Picture award, don't stand up to the expectations, we are all the more disappointed. The case here: Fatal Attraction.I was quite intrigued by the cover and the plot of the film. Not just that, the 'Oscar' mention raised expectations. A lot could have been explored about this subject, especially about Glenn Close's Alex Forest, because I was astonished to read the cases about Jodie Foster's and David Letterman's stalker and it also put me in wonder about what really happens to these people that they get so deviant. Alex Forest is a minx who can devour a man whom she falls in love with. We get that, yes, but we get just that, almost nothing else expect 80s pure camp. The film, about Alex's erotomaniac relation with Dan, written poorly, acted weakly by Michael Douglas drips with lasciviousness, since the three leads, which includes Dan's goody-two-shoes turned don't-mess-with-my-family wife, Beth, played by Anne Archer. We see heavy kissing, not much clothes, then no clothes, lots of kissing, boobies, kissing then some flimsy schmaltzy drama.The script and direction are executed without much regard for depth, similar to many horror films of the 80s, and I don't want tolerate shallowness. The dialogs are banal and cheesy – please do not search for 'interpretations', it's silly to construe any. The worst ones are between Douglas and Stuart Pankin at the party scene, or rather all the dialogs between them. It feels like the writer wanted to cut to the chase and therefore paid almost nil attention to provide any characterization for them. When things get messy for Dan, the film's treatment improves momentarily only to reach absurdity towards the end. There is awful scene shifting in 'Ellen is missing' scene and the 'rabbit scene' – yes, I said it, the rabbit scene was goddamn hilarious with Beth's screams in one shot and then Ellen's screams in the immediate next. Hideously gaudy camera work. The worst is saved for the last – I feel sorry for Close who tries her best, especially in the end, but is treated so badly and reductively by the director, Adrian Lyne.This is one of the time-capsule movies that should've been discarded by the 90s; it falls in the period somewhere in the 80s where the mystery, suspense, noir, thriller faded and gave way to less interesting jump scene horror like Fatal Attraction. My Rating: I had decided to give it a three but whenever I think of any of the above mentioned scenes from the film, I feel lousier. 2 out of 10",Fatal Attraction
92,moviesleuth2,Shocker is the word...,8,15 April 2010,"More than anything, ""Fatal Attraction"" teaches us that our actions have consequences. Sure, all stories involve decisions and what happens because of them, but what makes ""Fatal Attraction"" so unsettling is that every moment in this film is completely credible. What we do has an impact on other people, whether we like it or not.Dan Gallagher (Michael Douglas) is living the good life; he's a successful lawyer, has a beautiful loving wife and daughter, and is about to move into the country from the city. One weekend while his wife, Beth (Anne Archer) and daughter Ellen (Ellen Hamilton Latzen) are out of town, he has a fling with a beautiful woman, Alex Forrest (Glenn Close). He thinks it's just a weekend thing and then it's over, but she has other ideas. And she's not going to go away.The acting is solid, but the lion's share of the credit has to go to writer James Dearden and Glenn Close. Together, they've created a character who is so believable that the film becomes a terrifying thriller. Alex Forrest is no ordinary villain. She is psychologically plausible, and that's what makes this film so scary. At first, she seems to be just like any woman we would meet on the street, or in a café, or anywhere. But she's not, and Dan doesn't find that out until it's too late. Close and Dearden were robbed of Oscars on that night in 1988.Michael Douglas is solid as the everyman role, and while he's an effective protagonist, it's not much different than his other protagonistic roles (and there's nothing like a good Michael Dogulas villain, but that's for another 80's movie). Anne Archer got a Best Supporting Actress nomination, and I find that a little surprising since she's a little flat.The main problem with ""Fatal Attraction"" is that while Adrian Lyne's direction is effective, it lacks style. The look of the film is rather plain, and it's up to the actors to keep us interested (which they do).As infamous as it is effective, ""Fatal Attraction"" will make you think twice about doing something you shouldn't.",Fatal Attraction
93,maccas-56367,Terrifying Glenn Close,8,23 November 2019,"The ultimate ""don't stick your d**k in crazy"" movie that surprisingly still holds up to this day, despite some questionable 80s fashion choices.This will probably be timeless largely due to the terrifying (and phenomenal) performance by Glenn Close as Alex Forrest. It's truly the stuff of nightmares and Close solidifies her place among Kathy Bates (Misery) and Louise Fletcher (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest) as one of the scariest female villains of all-time.The most famous scene wasn't as bad as I had imagined, but there were still so many disturbing moments throughout. Once things get rolling and the craziness ramps up, it's really hard to look away. I was never bored and found myself engaged throughout.Perhaps the scariest element, was my ability to see certain behaviours in one or two past women I dated. This added sense of realism made Fatal Attraction creepier than many horror movies coming out these days.If this doesn't discourage infidelity, then I don't know what will.",Fatal Attraction

NO WAY...she's hideous...and out of all the women that he met at that social event that day, to meet this woman and immediately fall under her spell, he had to be nuts as she was.She wasn't sexy, she wasn't charming, she wasn't funny or insightful...she was nasty looking with a body of a skeleton and the charm of a lump of coal...what could he possibly see in her?

95,Beejerman,STANDING OVATION! - (10 stars out of 10),10,31 March 2019,"The stage curtains open ...When it comes to psychological thrillers, there are none better. ""Fatal Attraction"", starring Michael Douglas, Glenn Close, and Anne Archer, was the film by which the bar has been set - the recipe for success that other films aspire to have. Simply said, this one is the best - and it still holds up well even today.When family man, Dan Gallagher (Douglas) has a weekend affair with a co-worker, Alex Forrest (Close), she becomes obsessed with him to the point of being a danger to herself and everyone around her. Despite all of his efforts to distance himself from her and protect his family, she finds a way. Even after the Gallagher's leave the city for a home in the country - she stills finds a way to disrupt their lives, eventually forcing them into a life or death confrontation that people are still talking about today.Everyone involved with this film was perfectly placed, from the director Adrian Lyne on down to the casting choices. Very few actors can play the everyday man as effectively as Michael Douglas, and he sells it well here. Glenn Close really shows her acting chops in one of her finest roles to date as the dangerously obsessed psycho - one who is so desperate to get what she wants, no matter the cost. Even the little girl, Ellen, their daughter, was strong in her performance.Every once in a great while, a very special movie will come along where everything falls into place perfectly. Music, acting, cinematography, characters, direction, editing, special effects, memorable scenes (boiled bunny anyone?) ... everything. It resonates well, it captures and enthralls you, it sucks you in and never lets you go. This is that movie. If you have yet to see ""Fatal Attraction"" and you love a good thriller, stop reading about it and start watching it. You won't regret it.",Fatal Attraction
96,Nightman85,It pays to keep your pants on!,10,15 January 2006,"Big-hit of a thriller that left quite an impression on the audiences of 1987!Married man has a weekend-fling with an attractive woman, only to find out that she has become insanely obsessed with him!While Fatal Attraction owes a lot to the classic Clint Eastwood thriller Play Misty for Me (1971), it is a good thriller that manages to stand on its own. Its a film that well explores the themes of lust, obsession, and paying for mistakes! Fatal Attraction starts off innocently enough, but builds into a compelling drama and ultimately an intense thriller. It has its share of sex and violence to go with it. Director Adrian Lyne does a fine job of showcasing the startling turns that the film takes. It eventually reaches a knock-out of a finale.Michael Douglas is good as the not-so-sympathetic leading man. Glenn Close does perhaps the performance of her career as a forceful madwoman. Also good is Anne Archer as the understandably troubled wife of Douglas.Fatal Attraction is a film that requires some patience, but for those who can get behind this thriller, it pays off well.*** 1/2 out of ****",Fatal Attraction

He explains how bad this movie is then moves slowly towards the summary of his director's cut in which Michael Douglas has been edited out in favor of explicit girl-girl scenes.Bill Hicks might have exaggerated a bit, which he was famous for, yet some of his thoughts are valid. The main reason to see the movie was the scene in which Sharon Stone crosses and uncrosses her legs exposing the private parts.

102,DavidSim240183,Up Close & Personal,8,15 February 2009,"Fatal Attraction was one of the runaway hits of 1987. It also caused quite a stir among many minorities. Especially feminists who criticised its sexist, misogynist politics. When viewed today, and divorced from all the hype surrounding it, Fatal Attraction is a competent, compulsive thriller. But one that perhaps falls short of the enormous publicity it engendered.Even a casual fan will know the plot of Fatal Attraction. It wasn't even the first film to address the pitfalls of one-night stands. That was done before by Clint Eastwood when he directed Play Misty For Me. And that was way back in 1971. Its always seemed unusual to me that Fatal Attraction was the far more successful film, even though it were rehashing an idea already done.But still, there's no denying that Fatal Attraction is a rather involving film. Adrian Lyne's direction draws you right into the lives of the characters before you even know it yourself. Even when we see Michael Douglas eyeing up Glenn Close for a one-night stand, while Anne Archer is away for the weekend, we find it hard to pull ourselves away from the act of betrayal Dan is about to commit.Equally compelling is the consequences of the act. Watching it snowball into a growing mountain of problems Dan has brought on himself. But for all that, I always feel a nagging sense of disappointment once I've finished watching Fatal Attraction. In spite of the attention the film received, there is something a bit naive about it. Glenn Close's character, Alex exists as nothing more then an attack on Dan's traditional values.And the film becomes rather hypocritical in its second half. Dan's family seems to be the apex of all that is good and pure in this world. Something further reinforced by Adrian Lyne's lush, nostalgic direction. And yet when Alex tries to destroy that, are we just expected to ignore that Dan has all but done that himself? When he actually physically attacks Alex, I think we're expected to cheer him on. When in fact he set the whole event in motion.Fatal Attraction is a much better film in its first half. Because at least at that point, we don't know exactly how far this film will go. Fatal Attraction was the first of several questionable roles Michael Douglas would choose to play. And he does quite well as Dan. Watching him bend under the pressure Alex keeps piling on him is never less than engaging.And the role of Alex is the one that brought Glenn Close into the public eye. And the one that typecast her in the role of domineering, controlling women. Glenn Close certainly plays Alex to the hilt, becoming more and more deranged as the film goes on. But she is let down somewhat by the screenplay. James Dearden spends next to no time at all on Alex's background. We never even see her at her job. She just spends all her time hovering over Dan every step of the way. Aside from mood swings and paranoid obsession, Alex is a total blank.I've always thought Anne Archer is a greatly underrated actress. She always projects a forthright attitude coupled with an incredibly warm personality. And she's quite sexy too! And I loved her as Beth. She quite lights up the screen whenever she's around. Why Dan would want to cheat on her with Alex is a mystery to me!Adrian Lyne has brushed up a bit on his Hitchcock. And he does give us a few good shocks here and there. The bunny boiling has become the film's most famous scene. And its one that Lyne pulls off with aplomb. Beth walks up to the cooking pot, while her daughter does the same with her rabbit hutch. As soon as we find that the rabbit's gone, Beth takes the lid off the pot. Its a great bit of foreboding that works on two levels. And really packs a punch.Nothing else in Fatal Attraction quite matches up to that scene. Even when Alex slits her wrists as a manipulation tactic, that's something Lyne has stolen from Play Misty For Me. But its when it moves towards its climax that the film's flaws sadly begin to overtake it. As you watch the film, you sense some misogyny aimed at Alex's character. And that's what winds up shaping the film's finale.Lyne aims for a restoration of the status quo. Of conservative values winning out over Alex's vindictive behaviour. Quite a few scenes in the last 30 minutes are rather clumsily handled by Lyne. Like Alex kidnapping their daughter by taking her to a theme park. And then returning her. Why that is I have no idea? And then there's the grand finale. When Dan kills Alex in the harshest possible way. This ending was chosen over a far more low-key one when test audiences reacted badly to it. That only shows how willing Lyne was to cater to the demands of an audience. Even if it bent the film right out of shape.At the end of the day, I do feel Fatal Attraction is rather overrated. It does manage to keep you involved. But it comes saddled with too many flaws to make it a proper classic. It seems much too afraid of its own implications that it opts for a cop-out ending. Anything to wrap things up in a neat little package. When a film has this many double-standards, it becomes hard to swallow what we're seeing.",Fatal Attraction

This one isn't bad, it starts out a little too slow, which takes up the first half of the movie, but about halfway through the suspense starts, and when it starts its great. Glenn Close played a pretty good psycho(although she can't hold a candle to Robert DeNiro in ""Cape Fear""), Douglas plays his usual victim, the same character he has played in ""The Game"", ""Basic Instinct"", ""Disclosure"", etc. Overall not a bad thriller, definitely scary in some parts.

The movie is directed by Adrian Lyne who is known for his movies involving sexually charged characters, and he was nominated for an Academy Award for this movie, he also was involved in the 2002 movie also on infidelity Unfaithful.Glenn Close brought out a magical performance with Douglas standing out throughout the whole movie as the male dominant character.The movie follows the story of Dan Gallagher (Michael Douglas) a married man who had a weekend affair with a woman Alex Forrest (Glenn Close) when the Mrs was away.What was a nice weekend turned into a nightmare as Alex refuses to allow it to end, she starts using emotional blackmail and stalking to try and get Dan back.Dan confronted her and tried everything to stop her but all to no avail as Alex grew from blackmail and stalking to violence.The movie's weak spot is the lighting and the Cinematography, some areas in the movie was too muddled up to see and some camera shots were from strange angles. Adrian's choice of using smoke during some scenes didn't play out well for me. The scripts depiction of an obsessed woman is something that requires commendation as the fear of sexual adventure creeps into my heart anytime I hear or see this movie.Also another thing worth noticing is the lack of perfection in continuity, there were areas that you will notice continuity lapse.Other than that, Fatal Attraction is a nice film, showing infidelity for what it is a risky game that not only one party pays the price.",Fatal Attraction

A perceptive inclination to gander at a short skirt, a hint of cleavage, a heart-pounding hip wiggle. I ran smack dab into a door the last time I gawked, but consider myself darn lucky compared to Michael Douglas' character in FATAL ATTRACTION--a white-knuckled ""don't-let-this-happen-to-you"" thriller that vividly demonstrates what can happen to a guy when he lets other parts of his anatomy do his thinking for him. Manhattan lawyer Dan Gallagher (Douglas) has it all: successful career, attractive wife, loving daughter. So why not have an extramarital fling with a woman he met at a party while the family is out of town? Sure. Just a one-night stand. No harm, no foul. But there's something very ""foul"" about Dan's partner in crime, because blonde Alex Forrest (Glenn Close) may have all the right moves in the sack, but she also has an elevator that doesn't go all the way to the top. So when Dan wants to shake hands and part company, Alex will have none of it, and the table is set for a one-way ticket to Looney Land.Let the stalking. . .the suspense. . .the thrills and chills. . .begin. The bathroom scene, in which Dan's frazzled wife Beth (Anne Archer) wipes the steam off the mirror, is worth the price of purchase of this video alone.Director Adrian Lyne (as usual) delivers a gripping, antacid-popping story.

112,flicklover,"Very effective, well acted drama-thriller",9,18 April 2020,"Fatal Attraction is one of those films that had people talking long after it ended. It is certainly a cautionary tale about the effects of adultery and the recklessness that we as people are willing to take for momentary self gratification. It is a film that touched a nerve.The film stars Michael Douglas as Dan, a New York lawyer with a beautiful wife Beth played by Anne Archer and 5 year old girl. He goes to a party with his wife but meets a very attractive woman named Alex played by Glenn Close at a party for a publisher that she works for. Beth goes away with her daughter a Dan stays behind to attend a work meeting at Alex's office to discuss legal issues on a book. After their meeting they decide to go have as cup of coffee to avoid the rain. They have an instant chemistry. Dan is happily married but he is attracted to Alex and because his wife is out of town he sees a chance for a quick fling. The scenes between Douglas and Close are very sexy and playful. They of course have a very hot night where they have sex in every way possible. Director Adrian Lyne is a master a very polished, titillating sex scenes. After all, he us the director of 9 1/2 Weeks!!! For Dan, it is over, but Alex convinces him to see her again. The great thing about the relationship is that both characters at least in the beginning know that this is a fleeting moment. Alex knows he's married and accepts the situation, at least in the beginning. Dan is perfectly ok with cheating on his wife but says to Alex that there is no chance for anything more. All of this begins to bother Alex, and she begins to talk Dan. With his wife back, Dan wants to hidevtge affair. Alex keeps insisting and then reveals that she is pregnant. At first, Alex is presented as a troubled, lonely woman who does not let Dan just throw her away. But as the film goes we see that Alex is deeply obsessed and is capable of violence. Alm of this is the stuff of soap opera but the actors are so good that I was fully invested. On the one hand, Michael Douglas plays Dan as a generally good guy that thought he could have a little adventure without thinking of the consequences. He's not completely sympathetic, but we don't hate him. Glenn Close as Alex is very sexy, relatable but then the script does turn her into a dangerous quasi psychopath. She demands respect from Dan and he just won't give it. She begins punishing him by not leaving him alone and even showing up at his home. For the first hour the film is very much a drama, but the remaining time it goes full on thriller. Even though I still looked the film as a whole the change from very realistic psychological drama to sort of a slasher film is jarring. The performances are so good that the film keeps interest.It is certainly a film that has had men and women talking about infidelity since 1987 when it came out.Grade: A-",Fatal Attraction

117,fimimix,sure attracted me..,10,1 September 2006,"I was so engrossed in this movie, I noticed no goofs - weren't even looking for them ! - nor plot-holes. I had heard the title of ""Fatal Attraction"", but had no idea what it was about. I'm not even certain why I got the VHS, maybe because of the cast. Before I became totally involved in my work, I saw just about every major film when it was released. Then, many years of seeing only the TOP films; so, when my work was over, I was able to go to the theater, but decided it was not wise to pay such high entrance-fees, when I could buy a copy and watch it whenever I wanted to. Therefore, I usually bought what I had enjoyed so much in the past, or movies which I had missed, but knew something about. I watched ""Fatal Attraction"" without the least notion of what to expect, although the title does have a sinister sound to it.So, I wasn't surprised that ""Alex"" (Glenn Close) and ""Dan"" (Michael Douglas) went from dinner to bed, because that is not so unusual today. Those who wrote with a sniff of disapproval about what a cad ""Dan"" was, they aren't letting-on how really promiscuous MOST people are today, nor admitting how hot a good romp in an elevator would be. I was happy they had some good humps, all that panting and stuff; but, it wasn't a ""one-night stand"", guys: a weekend ? No one mentioned that ""Dan"" was trying to get-away several times, nor how ""Alex"" kept dragging him back. It would be my guess that those men who put ""Dan"" down for cheating on his wife are hoping a ""quickie"" like that comes their way. AND, some ladies, too......So, when I saw all the blood from ""Alex's"" wrists, I knew it was going to be a scare. ""Fatal"" screamed at me, just as I wanted to scream why ""Dan"" wasn't busy getting an ambulance. No doubt he was in shock, but my opinion is that he should have known right then he was in deep poop......how he didn't realize ""Alex"" was a psychic wreck is a mystery to me. After all, ""are you discreet?"" - she made the first move which, in my mind, put her on the prowl. ""Dan"" may have made the wrong decision, but he didn't deserve the licking he got. The period of time between the ""tryst"" and ""I'm pregnant"" was not developed enough to let us know so much time had gone by, and I didn't believe her. She was just hot for the dude's rough sex SHE led. I empathized with her from time-to-time, but there's no doubt she planned to get her point across. As some ""users"" wrote, ""Dan"" should have known better than to get involved with someone who was in his area of work. If you've never been harassed or stalked, thank your lucky stars and really be ""discreet"".I am also surprised to read that some folk couldn't see Glenn Close in that role. She's an accomplished actress - doesn't mean she is going to stay in the neat little category people put her in; in fact, it means she'd do a variety of roles to keep working. I'm not familiar with Anne Archer, but thought she was terrific - face it, guys: true love never follows a given course. Who is usually doing the stalking, even in real-life? MEN !! Close was totally brilliant in her role - she researched it fully, if you read the ""trivia"". Douglas played so many ""lawyer""-roles, he was just his pretty self in this one. ""The War of the Roses"" was from a different angle.""Fatal Attraction"" is a frightening movie, because it can happen so easily, without having any suspicion. In my many years as a night-club performer, I've seen it all - sometimes up-close. Anne Archer was so sweet in her role, makes one wonder if that couple had mixed-it-up with a little game-playing in their love-life, ""Dan"" wouldn't have gone through all that stress, ""Beth"" wouldn't have been nearly murdered and left to do the clean-up job in the bathroom, and ""Dan"" could have all those goodies at home.I'm sorry, I like the movie just as it is - I don't even need to see the intended ending. I think ""Madama Butterfly"" could be a tidy reason and highly emotional motivation for ""Alex"" to commit suicide, but I lost about tens years when she jumped-up in the bathtub. Thank heavens I have a shower ! Don't even mention ""Psycho"".......If ""Fatal Attraction"" isn't worthy of a ten-vote from almost anyone, I'm wondering just what it takes. Adrian Lyne did a great job on THIS movie - don't care how his others were - and James Dearden has my vote for a great script. This movie is a fabulous example of how just plain-ole dialog and acting doesn't need a lot of explosions and CGIs to make it wonderful - it surely gets MY 10.....",Fatal Attraction
118,antagonist117,"A rumination on the risks of indiscretion, but with dalliances of its own",8,15 January 2015,"""Fatal Attraction"" is a horror movie with a moral, a cautionary tale that confirms the blessings of family and fidelity. It is a smart movie that knows what it is doing—every conversation, every plot point is on theme. In a scene near the beginning, a legal team is discussing a book, a woman's fictionalization of her affair with a senator. The senator is threatening to sue for libel, but everyone in the room knows it's true. Next, a woman from the publishing firm (Glenn Close) and a married man from the law firm (Michael Douglas) extend their acquaintance over lunch. Their conversation, of course, quickly turns to indiscretions. This is effective set-dressing from screenwriter James Dearden, if you don't mind being peppered with an idea while it slowly comes to fruition. The movie takes its time to get to the junctures that we know must come, and which it so cleverly telegraphs. The titular attraction, with near fatality, play out in a steamy lost weekend that ends in a suicide attempt. The rest of the film is a tense period of escalation while we wait for the other shoe to drop. This stretch, too, is effective, as the film moves steadily out of the realm of family drama and into the horror genre. Maurice Jarre's score turns eerie and urgent as Douglas's character realizes that his actions have consequences, and that he has ransomed his perfect family to a woman bent on having him at any cost. But it remains rather obvious where things are headed, and if this isn't your first movie, it is possible to become impatient. A high point is the famous rabbit-boiling scene, as clinically executed as everything in the film. The rabbit was a pretty pet, kept only for a day or two, then slashed and drowned. The harrowing climax neatly mirrors this, but not before using a literal mirror in one of those stock horror moments where the killer suddenly appears in the glass. The trick is too old to work, as is the obligatory one-last-ending trope, the unkillable-killer trope. It's perfectly done, but it's too hackneyed. The script's original ending, which was filmed but rejected, is more original and fits just as neatly with all that has come before.Like almost all horror films, the villain here is the most interesting figure. That's unfortunate, because the real power of the movie is its message about family. It is a ringing injunction against the kind of vain, powerful men who cheat, men who gamble all that they have for no other reason than that they can. Douglas's character is asked twice why he strayed, and the fact that he cannot give an answer is one of Dearden's smartest observations. Nobody could leave this movie wanting to have an affair... unless, of course, they miss the point by focusing on Close's character. And that is easy to do. When the movie it ended, I went over it in my mind searching for clues about her life and her behavior. Why did she lie about her father? Did her miscarriage, if that story was true, trigger her mental instability, or was it a preexisting condition? Can someone so afflicted hold down a stressful publishing job, or was that some kind of ruse? Was she, in fact, none other than the woman who wrote a book about an affair with a senator? Perhaps she used a nom de plume, and that is why she was so certain that the woman was telling the truth. The questions and theories are endless. This is a tribute to Close's acting, but it is also a distraction from the real meaning of the film: that it is wrong to cheat, not because you might cheat with an insane person, but because in cheating you yourself become the danger that jeopardizes the stability of your life and home. ""Fatal Attraction"" very effectively externalizes that danger, and Close makes the most of the opportunity to bring to life one of cinema's most indelible and tragic villains, but I cannot shake the feeling that Douglas's character gets off the hook a little too cleanly. All he loses, in the end, is a rabbit he never wanted.",Fatal Attraction
119,wnterstar,Yick!,3,7 January 2005,"I absolutely hated this movie! I thought it was mean spirited and nasty. It's not to say that the acting was bad. Glenn Close shows that she can play any part she is given, be it a plain Jane, a courtesan, or a psychopath. Michael Douglas and Anne Archer both gave solid performances.My problem was with the movie, itself. Specifically, the ending. The person ultimately responsible for the chaos, pain and sadness is Dan Gallagher (Douglas). I know Alex was the nut and she was the one who's actions were directly responsible, but if Gallagher had been faithful, none of it would have happened!In the end, Alex pays the ultimate price for her actions, but what happens to Gallagher? It looks like his wife forgives him everything and there is no REAL come-uppance for Gallagher. (I know, I know...he had to endure everything that Alex put him through, but then again, the one innocent person (Beth) went through it too!)If I had been Beth, I think I would have blown Gallagher away right after Alex.All in all, this film left me with a bad taste in my mouth!",Fatal Attraction

Perhaps Michael Douglas' character had to be as stupid as possible. Did I mention that I think Anne Archer is so much sexier?",Fatal Attraction

Not a bad way to do so.  Movies have been made throughout time to stop people from doing one thing or another. Reefer Madness is a good example.

This glossy thriller plumbs the psyche of a neurotic woman who has issues and demons in her past that drive her to get even with and destroy a stranger with whom she just met after a wild weekend's sexual binge while his wife and daughter were out of town. Glenn Close is chilling as the predatory female who stalks her erstwhile lover, harassing him at every turn, destroying his property and engaging in emotional blackmail of the basest kind. Michael Douglas, as the spurned woman's target and victim, is desperate to keep his indiscretion hidden from his attractive wife, the classy Anne Archer. The cinematography is rich with excellent color and texture, especially the twilight scenes, and the music is spare with subtle shadings. The entire cast is top-notch, especially Close who eyes Douglas the way a python looks at a mouse.",Fatal Attraction

130,twanurit,Close Call For Douglas,10,21 February 2006,"I've re-watched it on DVD and it's still an amazing, unforgettable nightmare film, spawning countless imitators and a multitude of discussion. Glenn Close will forever be identified as the unhinged colleague of married with child Michael Douglas who have a brief fling that Douglas lives to regret. Close should have won the Academy Award for her electrifying portrayal of an attractive, seemingly ground woman who eventually lashes out in acid-spewing, bunny-boiling, knife-wielding hysteria. Douglas is equally effective, beautifully conveying increasing angst and guilt (later he looks sick when he finds his wife chatting with Close). The subject was done before in at least ""Possessed"" (1947) and ""Play Misty For Me"" (1971), but not quite as effective and engrossing as this well-directed thriller. I definitely prefer the panic-stricken theatrical ending to the overly low-key and unexciting original cut. See it with a significant other!",Fatal Attraction
131,ihrtfilms,Still brilliant after 20 years.,9,2 October 2010,"This is one those brilliant 80's films that paved the way for all those other copy cat films we are treated to. But this is a brilliant piece of film making unlike most of those that followed.Performances from both Michael Douglas and Glenn Close are great, but Close is the real stand out, just remarkable as the seductress/jilted lover turned psychopath. She steals most of the scenes she is in. The film contains some standout scenes, that have remained part of film history. Many of the set pieces are superbly choreographed and edited and give the film a strong sense of tension. Scenes such as the on the roller-coaster or the fight in the kitchen or even the end one in the bathroom are directed so well and surprisingly with minimal music to create atmosphere. Even sex scenes are done well, the first, in the sink is actually sexy, unlike most sex scenes in films which are often just gross.Of course one scene has remained to the day the films most famous and in fact still stands out as one of the most memorable in film history. That of course is the bunny boiling scene. It is superbly done, with the slow reveal and then the frantic editing between the two discoveries, the wife finding the bunny in the bubbling saucepan and the daughter finding her rabbit missing. Brilliant stuff.The film today may seem full of clichés, but only because we've seen it all before time and time again.

Even better is the directing, by Adrian Lyne, who keeps everything moving along in a very fluid and exciting way.  I also enjoyed what I interpret as the subtle symbolism Lyne works into the scenes. For example, during the beginning of the movie where Close and Douglass are together in bed, a slow turning ceiling fan and a pot of coffee burning on the stove both hint towards the dangerous consequences being set into motion.If you haven't seen this movie yet, do so.  If you have and it's been a while, see it again and I think you'll find it as good the second time around as I did.",Fatal Attraction
136,Willie-12,May Possibly Be The Greatest Erotic Triller Ever Made,8,21 May 2020,"**MAJOR SPOILERS**It's interesting. Adrian Lyne is responsible for two of the best erotic thrillers ever made. Fatal Attraction came first (the second is Unfaithful). What I like about Lyne, is he knows how to balance the erotic scenes with heavy drama. He is also a master at providing a false security in his films. In other words, when wathcing Attraction, the film is front loaded with the erotic scenes. For almost the first half hour of Attraction, one becomes so involved with the relationship between Dan Gallagher (Michael Douglas) and Alex Forrest (Glenn Close), and the initial chemistry that begins to evolve between the two, that it's easy to forget where this story is ultimately headed. Don't get me wrong. In that first half hour, there are definitely signs that Alex may not be the most stable individual in the world as she exhibits signs indicative of chemical imbalance. She will not take ""no"" for an answer when she tries to convince Dan to spend a second night with her. She responds to a prank in a strange way...a prank that Dan plays on her when he pretends to collapse while playing with the Gallagher family dog in Manhattan's Cental Park. She believes it's real at first, and begins to panic. After a few seconds, Dan opens his eyes, sits up, and starts laughing. Alex is initially pissed, claiming that her father died of a heart attack when she was young, right in front of her eyes. Dan apologizes, and then Alex begins to laugh while telling Dan that her father isn't dead, but living well in Phoenix. Dan appears to be a little bit perplexed by this as he lets out a little nervous laughter while saying, ""Well...I guess you got me."" Why this scene is so disturbing isn't fully realized until later in the film when Dan finds out that Alex's dad really did die of a heart attack when Alex was a kid. We don't find out whether or not it happened in Alex's presence, but it's subtely implied that it probably did. Alex, after their second day together, and following what becomes their last sexual liason starts to show much more intense psycholigical issues as she gets extremely angry when Dan attempts to leave. Ultimately, she then slits her wrists in an effort to keep Dan at her apartment to take care of her. The wounds are actually pretty superficial, but Dan does stay to make sure she is alright. It's after this scene that one is quickly reminded that this film is really about a literal ""fatal attraction,"" and Alex comprehensively begins to make Dan's life a living hell. And that's what I appreciate about Lyne's film and his skills as a director. Make no mistake about it, this is not a film that celebrates infidelity. On the contrary, it illustrates just how damaging infidelity can be. Dan obviously deeply regrets his decision to have the affair, and becomes terrified when he realizes that Alex is a very disturbed sociopath who will stop at nothing to either win his allegiance through black male and bribery, or ensure that, if he refuses to be a part of her life, he will rue the day he ever crossed paths with Alex Forrest. Lyne lays bare the myth that having an affair can be fun and intriguing and the false notion that, as long as one is being careful, then they can live and act as if everything is perfectly normal. Lyne also obliterates the notion that one can cheat on their spouse with little regret and guilt (It's important to note that Dan actually starts to show signs of regret and guilt well before Alex goes on her ballistic rampage), and he effectively delivers his message to the audience that, not only are affairs dangerous, they can also be catestrophic family destroyers. One last observation: Fatal Attraction has multiple scenes that portray a suspense and ominous feeling. But one of the most effective scenes of suspense comes in the form of the camera focusing on a ringing telephone. Yes...a ringing telephone. It's so simple and yet it's also filled with much fear and tension. A scene like that illustrates the genius of Lyne. If you have never seen Fatal Attraction, I strongly recommend it. I also strongly recommend another Adrian Lyne film about the destructiveness of infidelity...the film I briefly mentioned at the beginning of this review...the 2002 movie Unfaithful (starring Richard Gere and Diane Lane). There's a role reversal in Unfaithful in that it's the wife who has the affair, and there are some similarities between Fatal Attraction and Unfaithful. However, overall they are two very different films (Attraction is the better of the two, but Unfaithful is quite good too). And yet both effectively portray the destructiveness of infidelity.",Fatal Attraction

I just watched this movie because I am myself a fan of Glenn Close and the last thing I wanted was to be disappointed but I definitely wasn't. This is probably Glenn Close's best role (or just the best one I have seen her in). The movie follows a lawyer (Michael Douglas) whose wife and young daughter are off for a weekend and by chance runs into Alex Forest. After having one hell of a weekend together, the lawyer passes it off as a mistake but Alex won't take this abrupt end as an answer and so her thrilling and terrifying game begins! Although Michael Douglas comes up in the credits as the person with the main role and Close is second on the list I can't help but feel the Close took the spotlight.

From what I understand Cher won the award for Moonstruck. I never saw that film but I bet Glenn Close beat her out. Her performance is nothing short of convincing as a complete psychotic who burns a rabbit alive, dumps acid on Michael's car and kidnaps his daughter. I should point out that some of what happened to Michael he had coming to him. I mean after all he treated her like some sex toy for a one night stand and expected her to be OK with it. If I had a wife as pretty as Ann Archer I don't think I would cheat on her. In any case the problem I have with this film is the predictable ending.

The IMDb Trivia page says the movie originally had a different ending in which Glenn Close's character commits suicide and Michael Douglas' character is arrested for her murder. Ebert and most serious film lovers would likely have preferred that ending. But making profitable movies sometimes means making them unpalatable for highbrow students of film.Nevertheless, the ""flawed"" film resonated with women. I have vague memories of female friends and acquaintances in the late '80s seeing ""Fatal Attraction"" as an example of what SHOULD happen to any man who cheats on his wife. The movie found a place in our culture for a while, and the title was a euphemism for similar happenings in real life.One wonders how much this movie had to do with the near universal creation of ""stalker laws"" in the 1990s.",Fatal Attraction

Douglas' married Dan Gallagher and Close's Alex Forrest have a steamy affair while his wife is away. Except that Alex decides that it's not over.  Her Alex is a maniacal nutcase who isn't above anything to keep Dan for herself, including terrorizing his family and kidnapping his daughter.  Anne Archer plays Dan's wife; it's a role that many actresses can play in their sleep. She does a fine job, but it's similar to her roles in Patriot Games and Clear and Present Danger.There is a larger issue here, though, and one that was discussed when the film was released: Aside from the moral problems of adultery, doesn't Alex have a point ?  Isn't she entitled to something besides simply being used for a night or two ? The tension in this film is constant, although a lot of it seems too easily foreshadowed.

""It's all men's fault ... men pray on women, who are eternal defenseless, shrinking violets ..."" and on and on and on.SERIOUSLY?!This was at the end of the 20th century, for crying out loud.

The first is the bunny boiler scene, while the other is the final moment of the climax. I won't spoil that part, because it's too good for me to spoil.What keeps this film from getting a perfect score is the fact that Dan was portrayed in such a positive light when he was just as much to blame, if not more, than Alex's character was. He shouldn't have made out with her in the first place. But, honestly, that's really a minor complaint. The rest of the film is just superb acting and terror. Michael Douglas is a great actor, while Glen Close scared the crap out of me when she played Cruella De Vill in 1996 and the sequel.

Daniel does not suffer from a sudden attack of passion. He sees a woman he finds attractive, and makes use of the next opportunity he has to take her out to eat. Luckily, he thinks to himself, his wife is gone and he quickly proceeds to engage in propositions of a clearly sexual nature. If these hours of meditation do not reveal his extremely conscious infidelity, the fact that they are committed on back-to-back days surely does. Even more selfishly, Daniel waits until the moment when he has no choice to confide in his wife. No remorse is shown by Daniel, he simply wants to save his own hide. With Alex, the director explicitly attempts to dehumanize her into a crazy psychotic. Nothing of her past is shown to possibly explain her extreme dependence; we're reassured by this and can think, ""She's JUST crazy."" But the fact remains, it was Daniel who is the transgressor here. Breaking the bonds of marriage is incomparable to Alex's playful, single, copulations.
In the end, Daniel emerges the victor and his family is at last whole again. Is it really? Alex's original question of ""why"" still remains unanswered. Daniel's infidelities were the result of an underlying disunity with his family. Only a heathenistic liberal of a director could believe that these problems could be solved with an abortion or murder. A just and wholesome ending would have Daniel be murdered. He was the original cause of the discord and Alex was merely infected by him. By destroying the consequent and edifying the cause, an unacceptable message of anti-family-values and anti the-sanctity-of-marriage is proclaimed. This movie, along with Daniel, must be burned.",Fatal Attraction
147,stroggos,Decent movie that hasn't aged too well,6,24 August 2017,"FATAL ATTRACTION is a psychological thriller about the perfect family gone wrong, about one simple affair capable of destroying lives. Glenn Close does well as the psychopathic love affair. She and the entire cast deliver solid performances. The story keeps you going and the ending is truly suspenseful.However, FATAL ATTRACTION is a long haul away from being a masterpiece. The cinematography is quite generic. Dialogues are shot in long shot / re-shot sequences. Everything is set in rather dull environments: office rooms and bleak city apartments. However, it is the movie's pacing that is its biggest downfall. While FATAL ATTRACTION does pick up speed towards the end, the first half felt like a drag. I'm a fan of slow movies, but here the pace just wasn't justified. For such a pace, you need more than just generic archetypes such as ""the perfect wife"" and ""the loving husband"". The characters don't go much beyond what we've (since then) seen in many many movies.How has FATAL ATTRACTION aged? Yes, there's violence and sex that at the time must have been shocking... but audiences today are accustomed to more extreme stuff and may be bored by this late 80's flick. I'm not saying they should've turned this into a gory slasher movie ... but the movie ain't all that deep to really justify the ""psycho"" in ""psychothriller"".The other thing that hasn't aged so well is the 80's synth tunes... which just feel cheesy to modern audiences! ;-)",Fatal Attraction
148,kira02bit,A slick uninteresting perfume ad boosted by clever PR,2,12 October 2015,"I remember standing in line forever in the autumn of 1987 to see what the press was trumpeting as an edge-of-your-seat thriller that would scare you to death and being dumbfounded by the result.Michael Douglas portrays a wealthy, privileged guy married to stay-at-home glamour-puss mom Anne Archer. His marriage is seemingly great, but for some unknown reason he steps out for an extra-marital affair with frizzy-haired Glenn Close - a business acquaintance. Close then starts to go bonkers when she realizes that Douglas is not interested in continuing the affair and keeps injecting herself into his life in more sinister ways.To start with the obvious, the film is far from original and is a barely veiled reworking of Clint Eastwood's much better Play Misty for Me (a glaring similarity that no one in the press seemed to bring up). Some clever studio PR person came up with the idiot notion that the Close character was a metaphor for AIDS/STDs and that this was a cautionary tale of unprotected sex that the more provincially minded ate up since it made them think they were seeing something with deeper meaning. Alas, the film is as deep as a puddle and about exciting as watching paint dry.Director Lyne gives everything that obnoxious glossy look that proliferated in perfume ads in the 1980s. Both Douglas and Close are photographed in such an unflattering way that they should sue and their sexual trysts are of the grunt-groan wrestling kind that leave viewers laughing hysterically rather than titillated. Certainly not the ""torrid"" affair that the breathless ads postulate. Worse, the film is paced like a 50-mile tortoise race, with Lyne telegraphing every ""shock"" well ahead of time to defeat its purpose. There literally is not any scene where he does not tip his hand by moving the camera in an awkward position to indicate someone will pop up behind another character in a moment.The dialogue is almost painfully banal among the characters. Douglas seems to be suffering from fatal lockjaw in the lead role. He gives us no reason to understand why he is stepping out on his wife with the unappealing woman played by Close here and no reason as to why his character is such a total douche to Close in subsequent scenes. He is almost pathologically unsympathetic. Poor Close spends the majority of the film desperately trying to find pathos in a character that the film just wants to cast as a bogeyman. We get no reason why this seemingly well-adjusted career woman would go immediately unhinged after one night of sex with Douglas (although given the unintentional hilarity of their sex scenes I might reconsider that one). Anne Archer fares best as Douglas's wife, but the film cheats her in the big scene where Douglas reveals his infidelity by cutting her reaction short and she is stuck looking like a panic-stricken ninny in a completely pointless sequence where Close nabs her child resulting in a hysterical Archer crashing her car rather than contacting the authorities. The film ends on a predictable note, but no more so than anything that preceded it. Unless you have never watched a film before, there is nothing present here that was not previously done much better elsewhere. The delirious reception and notoriety for the film seem more due to the breathlessly misleading public relations than anything on screen, because in all honesty I have met more people that dislike it or have issues with it than those who unequivocally like it. After all the build-up, one is left with a predictable, painfully dull, superficial piece of nonsense. Quite frankly the only people I can see being terrified or in a constant state of suspense from this tedium are affluent married men either in an extramarital affair or contemplating one. And having to endure this overrated rubbish more than once would be a suitable punishment for many crimes.",Fatal Attraction
149,MuggySphere,"dramatic, suspenseful, glued to my seat.",8,25 April 2003,"First off the casting of the film was in my opinion perfect. Michael Douglas was perfect for the role of the husband and Anne Archer was and is I think the ideal movie wife. She's dramatic, beautiful, and sexy all rolled into one. Plus she's dependable. When she tells the jilted woman in this movie ""If you come near my family I'll killyou"" you know she means it.  They also have a daughter in this film Ellen, played by child actor Ellen Hamilton Latzen. You don't see her much in the movie but when she does get screen time she's just so damn wonderful.The film is also quite topical too. I mean how would you react in the same situation if your partner or even you had that one night of passion, and then found that the other person didn't want it to end, or understand that it was a fling and that you knew what you were getting into but shouldn't have done it. I was stuck to my seat the whole film right to the ending....Overall I loved it...",Fatal Attraction
150,eytand94,Fatal Attraction: Still Attracting And Frightening Us 24 Years Later,10,8 October 2011,"""I'm not gonna be ignored, Dan!""-Alex ForrestDan Gallagher is a happily married attorney with a beautiful wife, Beth, and a cute young daughter, Ellen. His life is steady and calm. Until he meets Alex Forrest at a book-release party. When Beth and Ellen go away for the weekend, Dan and Alex have a one night stand that Dan will soon learn to regret, and not just in his marriage. The weekend tryst may be over between Dan and Alex, but she refuses to let the relationship go ignored. Soon enough, Alex's attraction turns Dan's life into a waking nightmare that not only threatens him, but also the lives of Beth and their daughter.Although Clint Eastwood's ""Play Misty For Me"" was a nifty romantic thriller, ""Fatal Attraction,"" released in 1987, pushed all the right buttons and kept a lot of pants on (not off) men. Once the film found its audience, no man ever wanted to get involved in a one night stand, especially with somebody like blond seductress Alex Forrest.The cultural resonance and heart-stopping suspense of the film still works today, but stuns even more when viewing it from the perspective of an 80's generation moviegoer. AIDS had just been discovered, and women and men alike viewed Adrian Lyne's film as an answer to the disease. Once Dan and Alex have sex, she becomes an infection in Dan that won't go away and nearly kills him.James Dearden's characters are complex and well thought out. His script allows us to view the perspectives of Dan, Alex, and Beth, and they all provide a healthy dose of empathy, especially and surprisingly for Alex. A woman that would come off nowadays as a simple psychopath, we can understand where Alex is coming from. For the first two acts of the movie, Alex, and maybe the female viewer, feel that Dan dragged HIMSELF into this attraction, and he can't just act like it never happened. Then the third act comes around, and a sympathetic, lovesick human being turns into a dangerous femme fatale that we the audience demand to see taken down.Then there's Dan's point of view. With such a happy marriage, there was really no reason to succumb to infidelity. But he knows it was a mistake, and we later sympathize with him more than Alex.And poor Beth. Such a beautiful woman with a faithful marriage and a close relationship with her daughter. Like I said before, why on earth did Dan have to have a one night stand? When she finds out, the scene is heartbreaking and her anger towards her husband is definitely jarring. But knowing of Dan's mistake, she gets the idea that Alex won't leave her family alone, and she's ready to take a stand. With a restrained rage and intense bravery, she picks up the phone, and says to Alex: ""This is Beth Gallagher...If you ever come near my family again, I'll kill you!"" The audience stands up and cheers.Adrian Lyne squeezes some fantastic performances from his cast. Michael Douglas does a perfect job of playing the normal and sympathetic husband that everyone can relate to. The lovely Anne Archer gives a great performance, as well. But I think, after twenty-four years of popularity, it's pretty obvious that people watch the movie for Glenn Close's terrifying portrayal of Alex. Known for such good-natured films as 1983's ""The Big Chill,"" nobody expected Close to play a role like this, which makes her performance all the more memorable. She makes Alex the subtly frightening and sexy predator that she is. With just a tiny wink of an eye, or a stare into the camera, or a twitching smile, Close pulls out all of the stops and makes for one of the most iconic villains in film history. This performance guarantees some major shivers.After multiple viewings, my feelings toward ""Fatal Attraction"" stay the same. It is a flawless erotic thriller with genuine suspense, some truly shocking moments(you know what scenes specifically I'm talking about), Oscar-worthy performances from Douglas and Close(why didn't she get it?!), and some extremely steamy sex scenes. Movies like ""Obsessed"" (an exact replica of Lyne's film with not even a particle of originality) or ""The Crush"" fail to measure up, and no movie will ever be able to do what ""Fatal Attraction"" did. Brace yourselves, folks. This classic is a ride unlike any other!",Fatal Attraction
151,ranblackman,"Sleek, creepy thriller.",8,10 May 2019,"This film from the opening is a pact with genuine suspense, genuine drama, and a slow burn to play it all out steadily. Micheal Douglas turns in a great performance as every man, every man who made a terrible mistake when he decided to break out of the confine of massive. He sleeps with someone, the worst sort of someone, whom, after hearing if his regrets begin to stalk him.The main suspense in this movie comes from that, wondering where Glenn Close will pop up, where she will close in. Where the family decaying state will take it all. There is some quality drama, some quality tension. When it all plays out the way to does, the sleek build, the huge climax feels earned. Its a good warning against cheating and commentary on stalkers. All of which is delivered well tuned and punctual.",Fatal Attraction

You never know what your lovers can do... It's thriller from the beginning until the last minute (or second...). Some scenes became cliches today but it's not fault of this movie.

153,paul_johnr,Know a good psychiatrist?,7,16 May 2007,"When 'Fatal Attraction' first appeared in 1987, it mixed elements that were destined to become a hot item. The film had a superb lead cast of Michael Douglas, Glenn Close, and Anne Archer. Add to this rundown the leadership of '9 ½ Weeks' director Adrian Lyne and a screenplay not only brimming with tension but also willing to pluck a sexual nerve in the AIDS-ridden landscape of 1980s America. Over $400 million in box office and video sales later, this film easily ranks as one of the most influential of its time and has spawned many clones in the erotic thriller genre.'Fatal Attraction,' which was nominated for six Oscars, does just about everything right to create a thriller that stays in the mind long after being watched. James Dearden's screenplay (expanded from a BBC film short) is a concentrated effort on the lives of four people: attorney Dan Gallagher (Douglas), his wife Beth (Archer), his daughter Ellen (Ellen Hamilton Latzen), and publishing adviser Alex Forrest (Close), who meets Dan at a party and joins him for a weekend fling. Minor characters brush with the storyline, but Dearden limits key happenings to this quartet and shows how the briefest infidelity can lead to disaster. In 'Fatal Attraction,' Alex Forrest is every cheating husband's worst nightmare, a psychotic woman who will terrorize an entire family to get what she wants.Adrian Lyne's thriller is very much of its time, dealing with a middle class family whose husband earns his pay in a changing workforce. Alex Forrest, played superbly by Close, is akin to the many (sane) women who enjoyed career advancement during the 1980s, when reactions built up against feminism of the previous decade. Beth Gallagher represents the traditional housewife, who shuns career to provide at home. These points are understated, however, and 'Fatal Attraction' is driven mostly by its character development, the absolute must for a successful thriller. As Alex wobbles out of control and Dan grows in desperation to stop her, 'Fatal Attraction' reaches unexpected levels of tension that rival any other such film in history. And it's unafraid to be repugnant and brutal, making use of attempted suicide, kidnapping, and a cooked rabbit.I have not lately seen a film that produced so many conflicting emotions as 'Fatal Attraction.' In the opening 80 minutes, it has the gloss of a feminist tale; Alex is (supposedly) left pregnant by Dan, who considers his extramarital dealings over with and retreats into family life. But just as Alex gains your sympathy, she intrudes upon Dan's wife and daughter, making the film take on a completely different attitude. And here rests one of the movie's biggest flaws, in that James Dearden's screenplay doesn't reach its absolute potential; it stops short of an irreversible punishment for Dan's affair and heads toward a more conventional ending, albeit a very effective one. There are also considerable plot gaps (how does Alex take Ellen to an amusement park directly from school, without parents or teachers questioning?), but these problems are smoothed over by the fine performances, which come to embody outright good and evil.'Fatal Attraction' was originally filmed with a quiet ending that went belly-up at preview screenings. A more approachable (and violent) finale was shot months after production had wrapped. Both endings are included on Paramount Pictures' 2002 DVD release, which bears a 'special collector's edition' label. The disc (a volume of Paramount's 'widescreen collection') is worth every nickel, containing a pristine feature and several extras. Helped by its newness, 'Fatal' is in excellent visual condition with a choice of 5.1 surround sound or Dolby surround. Also supplied are French 'dubbing' and English subtitles. A commentary track with Adrian Lyne makes up one of the special features, along with three featurettes on production of the film: 'Forever Fatal: Remembering Fatal Attraction,' 'Social Attraction,' and 'Visual Attraction.' Topping it off are VHS rehearsal clips of Douglas, Close, and Anne Archer before 'Fatal' entered production, the original (and in my opinion weaker) ending, and the theatrical trailer.Adrian Lyne's commentary is both pleasant and informative, relating to the goings-on in his quiet, casual manner. The three featurettes shed new light on this film, allowing cast members and crew to reflect on its artistic and social impact over the last twenty years. 'Visual Attraction' is most interesting, giving due credit to the people whose attire (costume designer Ellen Mirojnick), facial work (makeup artist Richard Dean), photography (cinematographer Howard Atherton), and sets (production designer Mel Bourne) are easily forgotten in a movie without huge special effects or epic scenes. Always hard-hitting and almost guaranteed to keep married men in line (*wink*), 'Fatal' remains a diamond in the rough and a standard of 1980s film-making.*** out of 4",Fatal Attraction

Glenn's charcter Alex Forrest gives off a convincing shock of sexual tension and scarriness. This was a bit of change for Close and she is terrifying!!!!! Anyhow, the plot is very simple it is about a family man who cheats on his loving wife while she and the cute daughter are visiting her relatives and househunting; He and Glenn Close begin by having sex then salsa dancing. The next day they hang out together because she insisted, and go into the park where Michael Douglas fakes a heart attack. They then come back to her apartment and discuss his family and then they are in her bed and he says he has to go home so she gets mad and then cuts her wrists. He stays with her until morning and they meet again 2 days later saying that she has 2 tickets to see Madam Butterfly but he says no, so the next day she goes to his apartment under the pretext that she was touring the apartment to buy it, he gets mad so he goes to her apartment where she says the infamous line ""I will not be ignored!"" She threatens to confess to his wife he says he'll kill her. The next day she sends a package to his office(it is a tape with her on it) he then goes to his car with the ""rabbit for his daughter and finds that she threw acid on his car. He then rents a car and listens to the tape not knowing that Glenn is following him to his new house. Then, the next day the family leaves to see the relatives again taking the dog but leaving the rabbit. Then about 4 hours later they return and Anne Archer discovers ""rabbit stew"" Then after that Michael confesses about his weekend fling. She throws him out. The next day Anne picks up the daughter but finds out that someone has already picked her up and it is Glenn with the daughter at a amusement park. Then while they are at the park Anne gets in an accident and is horrified. After Michael visits her in the hospitial he goes to Glenn's apartment and attacks her but she tries to stab him with a 10 inch butcher knife but he redeems her. But he didn't see the last of her!!!! She then comes over to kill Archer and is in s hot steamy bathroom it isn't until Douglas hears Archers screaming that he goes up and strangles Close under the water she stays under for about 60 seconds until she _????????????________________________________________Highly Recommend!!!!!

And not only him but the rest of the crew as well.To me, the best part of this movie is actually the very believable plot. This is a situation that could happen to anyone, and to a different extent has happened to people I know. Furthermore, both the script and all the actors make the movie all the more believable. It is true that the movie deflates itself towards the end, but overall it is a great movie, and even a warning movie for the ones attempting to do what is done there.The movie gets 8 points on my list because of the less-believable ending, and also because Glenn Close, while doing a perfect part in the acting, should take the part of the wife, and the wife (Anne Archer) should take the part of Glenn Close. This said, even as it is the movie should not be unbelievable. I have seen worse, and you will know what I mean when you actually watch the movie yourself.One thing that cracked me up were the negative comments on this website. It seems that they were mostly written by women with chip in their shoulders. They do not criticize the movie, but the ""fatal attraction"". They criticize the fact that men would do this or that, or that a man would prefer X over Y...basically making quite clear that something touched them at a personal level and they did not like it. I guess truth hurts.If you haven't watch this movie, do it. It is well written, incredibly well acted, and as much as you will have to forgive the last 5 minutes, it is overall a great movie.",Fatal Attraction

It is amazingly true to life. I know since I had a girlfriend turn psycho on me when I was twenty-one, and some of the disturbing scenes in the film -- although not the most disturbing -- seem to have been lifted directly from that very dark period in my life.After watching this movie again, I came away with the certainty that it is one which loses more than most in its translation to the small screen. It is still a classic in my view, though, since it is not only terrifying in its portrayal of both mental illness and violation of privacy, but also a great illustration of how sexual indiscretion can, and often does, backfire. I recommend it for adults, especially those with a wandering eye.",Fatal Attraction

It only has 16,000 votes on here and only has a score of 6.7, come on people! This movie is much better than that! It's freaking excellent, and Glenn Close never got the recognition she deserved, and she fits into the role as Alex Forrest perfectly. She manages to make us feel pity for her because she's sad, lonely and doesn't have anyone by her side, and that's why she's so obsessed with making Dan (Michael Douglas) her own. And you would also hate her because she becomes a knife-wielding, bunny-boiling, and child-kidnapping maniac.Michael Douglas is in one of his seminal roles in his entire career, and since this released in the same year as ""Wall Street"", a movie which he won an Oscar for, this was one of the reasons why 1987 was the year of Michael Douglas. He plays the guy who is happily married with a gorgeous wife and daughter (which some of you may mistake for a boy). And he just makes a common mistake by sleeping with a woman he bumped into at a party (Glenn Close). However, it turns out she's a total psycho and starts stalking Dan and his family.Even though ""Fatal Attraction"" has been dead to the public eye, it is still a guaranteed classic that is worth your time, and to all the married women, you should try to force your husbands to watch this so they can understand what you get just for having an affair.

The performances were great, and the characters were developed enough so the audience could feel something for them. It also has perfectly placed suspense, and it's a moral tale. Everyone here knows the plot - a happily married lawyer played by Douglas spends a steamy weekend with Close's character, Alex, who becomes obsessed with him and won't let him go. Although Alex takes things to the extreme with this obsession, she does make a valid point - if Dan was so happy with his wife and child, what was he doing with her? If he didn't want to lose his family, maybe he should've thought of them before sleeping with her in the first place. Dan also makes the valid point that Alex knew he was married and he made no promises to her. But saying that before sex is one thing, and afterward is another. Yes, Alex was just as much a part of the affair as Dan, but he had a lot more to lose: his family.",Fatal Attraction
170,groatski,Good movie. Bad message.,7,28 October 2005,"My apologies, but this isn't as much of a movie review as it is a personal rant. I thought this movie to be an excellent thriller when I first saw it, and although I still think so, after reading some of the more negative reviews I'm starting to see it in a different light.Glen Close's mental instability aside, if Douglas hadn't been a philandering swine none of this would have taken place. I've heard from more than a couple of guys that it is their belief that all married men fool around; it's instinctive and unavoidable, and it's the job of the wives to just understand and accept it. As a married man I can attest that this is pure bullsh*t, and just hearing it torques me off. These men are selfish, immature, deceitful and arrogant SOBs that give the entire male gender a bad name (and no, I'm not some meek, whipped little man who's wife is currently standing over his shoulder). Douglas is more than partially responsible for everything that is happening to him and his family, yet he accepts no blame. I've heard that feminist organizations just frothed at the mouth over this movie, and for the first (and hopefully last) time I'm in agreement.The ending is particularly unsatisfying, not to mention overly drawn out. Basically it ends with a dead Glen Close, and a still unrepentant Douglas in the arms of his wife. No consequences, all is forgiven, and dollars to dough-nuts he'll be playing hide-the-salami with some other woman before the year is out.BTW  Chronic infidelity is NOT an exclusively male characteristic.",Fatal Attraction

173,shermanlazzar,Actually not too bad,6,17 October 2009,"For a movie now going on 22 years, Fatal Attraction is a still a worthwhile thriller.Glenn Close gives a great performance. I felt like I had seen the movie already due to the numerous references to it in pop-culture throughout the years. As such I was probably not as shocked as I otherwise would have been. Nonetheless there are still some genuinely disturbing moments in this. One thing I have always wondered is why Glenn Close is the temptress in this, as good an actress as she is, I can't find her the least bit attractive. Although, in this she is actually done up to look quite pretty and I think another actress could've pulled off the psychopath woman-scorned act quite like she did.Speaking of which, how many hot sex scenes has Michael Douglas been involved in? Sharon Stone and Demi Moore if you don't mind. Lucky bastard! Anyway, he was good in this too. Overall, not a bad flick.",Fatal Attraction

I see lots of comments about how Anne Archer is so much more attractive than Glenn Close, and therefore, it's puzzling why Dan would have an affair with Glenn Close. Fact is...neither one of them is attractive. I fine Anne Archer's face to be very unattractive. Everyone already knows that Glenn Close is homely as sin. While I am at it, Michael Douglas is not attractive either. How did he become a leading man? Oh yeah...he had family connections.",Fatal Attraction

176,sean73267326,A flawed classic.,8,15 July 2015,"""Fatal Attraction"" is one of those rare movies that has managed to penetrate the public consciousness so much that we almost forget just where its most famous moments come from. Take the term ""bunny boiler"" for example - how many times has it been said by someone who hasn't the faintest idea that it originated in this movie? It's an impressive feat, but the film itself has been held up to serious scrutiny over the years due to it's (supposed) underlying message.More on that later, though. It's more important to enjoy a movie than analyze it, and Fatal Attraction is a great thriller. It feels like the kind of film Hitchcock might have made had he been born 30 or 40 years later - that is to say it's a total suspense movie, with more violence and sex than he would have been allowed (or allowed himself) to show. The director Adrian Lyne (who would go on to forge a career based on this kind of subject) injects the screenplay with a kind of creepy, sexually charged drama that gives the film its famous bite. Impressively, he never shows much to the camera - violence is rare, nasty, but left to our imagination.On equally impressive footing is Glenn Close in her signature role. It begs belief that she actually managed to make a character like Alex, who seems like a nasty piece of work on paper, seem sympathetic and genuinely mentally ill on screen. For every histrionic fit, there's a genuine sadness and depression in her eyes. Her performance sets it apart from slasher-lite territory - she doesn't portray a superhuman, jealous monster, she portrays a woman with needs, affections and senses. It's a breath of fresh air, further enhanced by equally strong supporting work from Anne Archer.And now, back to why it's ever so slightly problematic. Here be spoilers; you have been warned.Her performance, unfortunately, is one that the film doesn't know what to do with. In portraying Alex so well, Ms. Close managed to show up some major problems with the film, mostly to do with the ending. For the first 110 minutes or so, the film manages to function as both a commentary on infidelity and marriage, and a balls-to-the-wall thriller. For the final 10 minutes, it shifts gear and kicks it into full on thriller. A violent struggle ensues, our villain has been killed, and our protagonist has managed to die another day. Yay! But this is the kind of ending that only works when we don't feel a sympathy for the villain - Glenn Close does such a good job as Alex that we realize she WAS a human, a mentally ill one. Michael Douglas'character doesn't go to the police until it's too late because he doesn't want to own up. So, in the end, the mentally ill woman is killed, and the cheating husband gets off comparatively light. This small flaw puts the rest of the film in a slightly bad light - for a film that straddles the line between a thriller and classy commentary so expertly, it manages to nosedive fairly drastically here. It's a pity, because it's not the ending that the film deserves - in an ideal world, both characters should have been killed - and it's most definitely not the ending that Close's performance deserved. Having said all that, the film works well for 100% of it's running time on a purely thriller level (including the ending), and that's good enough for me once manage to ignore my problems with it. It's a film that thoroughly deserves its pop- culture status, and will be discussed and debated for years to come.",Fatal Attraction
177,t.mcparland-2,Fatal Detraction,10,16 October 2000,"The fact that a competent reviewer gave Fatal Attraction a no-no, proves the adage that art, like beauty, is in the eye of the ticket holder. Bow-legged and deliberately-portrayed ominous, Glen Close- and Michael Douglas are bound by adultery. Douglas, professionally and in this movie, a nasty piece of work, is ensnared by his own lust, Close, by her paranoiac self-reflection as an irresistible lover. The title, one would like to believe was ironic. But knowing Hollywood's tortoise-like following of social mores, the movie's kernel belongs to pre-aids days. The word attraction' is a misnomer; there is- nor ever was- anything attractive about adultery- or betrayal. So what makes this movie, with its ludicrous ending, great? Our involvement with the spiritual poverty of its central protagonists? The divergent wholesomeness of Ann Archer and Ellen Hamilton Latzen as the sinned-against middle-class American family? If I knew that, I would be making movies. But in those who have contemplated the memory and what-if?' repercussions of wrongdoing, this movie will strike a profound conscience pang.",Fatal Attraction
178,1981,Very little substance and ostensibly obstreperous.,4,1 August 2001,"This was an obstreperous film, it took almost no responsibility for itself and was extremely predictable and transparent. The plot is formulaic: Douglas and Archer (his wife) are at a party, he accidentally meets an attractive and icy young professional (Close) and there is instant chemistry. Why is there this chemistry? Quite simply, the two find something about one another physically irresistible. Douglas simply thinks with his organ, nothing else appears to enter his mind. He appears to love his wife very much and one would think they have been enjoying a good marriage. He has a daughter, a good career he appears to enjoy, he is attractive and healthy. So what went wrong? Apparently nothing other than an arrogant chauvinism on his part. He made a mistake, a simple mistake in his mind, then things get ugly.Close is a loose canon and deeply disturbed. Why? Well, in a rather flaky moment this film attempts to address this question by showing Douglas breaking into her apartment and discovering the death of her father in a newspaper clipping. He died fairly young of a heart ailment, a fact alluded to (if allusion is even proper considering how obvious it was as a technique) earlier in the film when Douglas and Close are in Central Park with his dog. She is carrying some type of emotional baggage. OK. But to become a murderous, unscrupulous kidnapper, stalker, hell-bent, obsessive, suicidal manipulator? Did I miss something? And furthermore, what happened to that flourishing career of hers we briefly, ever so briefly, get a glimpse of at the beginning of the film? Does she simply forsake her entire successful career, a career that must have taken years to build and mould in order to flourish, (as it apparently has been doing), in order to stalk Douglas? That is almost nonsensical. Why would a woman, whose apartment they meticulously filled with books and manuscripts, become so vapid and wounded and prepared to ignore all of her intelligence and spiritual/emotional reserves, which ostensibly enabled her to rise to success, in order to do such damage? How could she have come so far with this type of vapidity and singular weakness? And one should also ask, why does she find Douglas so important? Has she never experienced rejection before? If so, then why is she single and wary of men at 36? Obviously she has some experience with loss, mistakes and disappointment. If not, then she is a spoiled executive and success who always succeeds. But then, why would she forsake her career so easily? Do you see how many holes this story possesses?
And by the way, how is it that a magnificent controversy did not erupt over this film considering that Anne Archer and Douglas manage to kill the ""pregnant"" Close? Can you even imagine trying to get by with that today, with all of the arguing over abortion, stem-cell research and litmus tests for Supreme Court nominees? I am puzzled, if the ""Last Temptation of Christ"" could literally be crucified for its questions over the divinity of Jesus, how could killing an unborn child so cavalierly escape scrutiny? And what is worse is that the film simply ends there! The police come, everything is okay, Archer and Douglas have their arms around one another, there is no spiritual guilt, everything is discrete and tidy. Well, congratulations! How much more obstreperous and fantastic can we get? This script is unintelligent and cliche. Every action taken is predictable but what is worse is that it is predictably illogical. There is no character development in this film. None whatsoever. In fact, these characters are about as unidimensional as one could imagine. I don't understand all of the hype, the film did not even offer any surprises. It not only doesn't work as a story, but as a suspense film it lacks any suspense. We know immediately that Close is psychotic. We don't know why, the nuances of her personage don't exist, but that doesn't matter. She is simply psychotic and somehow that is all the explanation we need.Don't waste your time. The best film Adriane Lyne ever made was ""Jacob's Ladder."" Don't miss it! Forget this film, it is not worth consideration.",Fatal Attraction
179,Cinesnatch,"Glenn Close, A Woman Scorned (An Understatement)",9,20 May 2003,"Glenn Close plays against type as an overtly sexual professional weaving family man Michael Douglas into her dens of psychosis. Her incomparable intensity initially seduces, but eventually repels the husband and father. The tension gradually increases as the fabric of this man's family slowly begins to unravel. As he repeatedly escorts the woman to the exit, all Hell breaks loose. Douglas' first unofficial submission in a series of persecuted white male films, he begins playing flawed, yet misunderstood men targeted by villainesses misguiding him with their sexuality. One could chastise this film for its social overtones. Read a little too closely, and you could detect a dated assertion that a woman's place is in the home. If you want to find a disgruntled female, look no further than any woman who placed career before marriage/motherhood. Times have changed, but thankfully we have this film that liberally played with such themes. The reshot ending has bombast, but lacks the integrity of the original shown to the disapproval of test audiences at the time. But, from a marketing perspective, it was a pretty shrewd move. This was the first film to show two people having sex in a kitchen sink, a blowjob conducted in an elevator and a boiling bunny and go on to multiple Oscar nominations (including Best Picture).",Fatal Attraction
180,jeannel2003-618-511281,A Classic,10,1 August 2010,"This is the movie that set the pace for the ""other woman"" genre. It broke the mold for stories of love triangles involving married men. The subject matter is daring for any era or generation, and is delivered expertly by Michael Douglas, Glenn Close and Ann Archer, who give electrifying performances.The movie puts into sharp relief the all-too-familiar theme of the cheating husband of the long-suffering and faithful wife with the glamorous and exciting single career woman. But instead of the other woman clinging to the doomed affair by living on the periphery of the man's life, Glenn Close's character, Alex, inserts herself into the life of her new married lover, Dan, with a vengeance - literally - wreaking havoc at a level that is terrifying and thrilling. Suspense builds as Dan realizes that he has opened a Pandora's Box and tries to hide his indiscretion from his wife, Beth, whom he loves, and struggles to defend himself against the fury of the woman he has scorned. The unfolding of the story is breathtaking, and the denouement is shocking.The movie reminds me of ""Rosemary's Baby"" in the way the writer and director weave everyday, normal activities with the doom that is building for Dan and his family. And, as in ""Rosemary's Baby,"" an unstoppable chain of events has been launched, in Dan's case by his ""fatal attraction"" to a beautiful but unstable woman who is determined to possess him or destroy his family.Because of its nearly flawless execution and impact, Fatal Attraction is a not-to-be-missed classic.

181,bgh48,Highly manipulative and with 2 great dogs - Close & the family pet,6,17 October 2006,"The ""brilliance"" of the film, I suppose, is that Glenn Close is such an unattractive woman (great actress, but a real dog with virtually no sex appeal) and the wife, Anne Archer, is so warmly beautiful. This is the point: a man will irrationally have a fling, not based on the looks of the lover. (although we are given subtle hints that his wife treats him like a little boy, and it seems the ""honeymoon"" portion of their marriage was over when they had the child. The director gives us a lot of symbolism, especially the use of the family dog, to represent domestic stability, and it's a great dog, with the best tail-wagging ever. Closes' name, ""Forrest"" represents the tangled, hidden depths of her sick personality. The movie is slick and cunning; every camera angle telegraphs it's unsubtle subtlety. It's ripe for parody as it has been. Douglas has never been sexier (even when he coos at the doggie for doing ""good business"") and Close is a revelation, truly frightening.",Fatal Attraction

183,vorazqux,See It for Glenn Close,9,28 August 2007,"I think everyone knows the story here: A man fools around with a woman suffering from borderline personality disorder, which sparks a downward tailspin in his personal life, to say the least. Everyone in this film gives a great performance, but it's Glenn Close who was robbed of the Academy Award. I don't know why she hasn't won an Oscar yet because she has given one superb performance after another. I don't even think Alex Forest was one of her best performances. She has demonstrated such versatility and emotion, often in a single, unedited scene, and yet is Oscarless. Go figure...Glenn Close may not have seemed like an obvious choice for this role, but that's a credit to her acting talents and how she can manipulate any role she tackles. The scene in the restaurant where Close entices Douglas into having a one–night stand is priceless. That scene alone was worth the Academy Award as Close proved she could play sexy, and then some. If they give Judi Dench an Oscar for eight minutes of screen time involving less emotional sustenance in a role (Shakespeare in Love), then politics are running too rampant. But, in general, this is a very entertaining film with a message to convey. I actually felt sorry for Alex Forest when she was killed. Dan (Michael Douglas) should have been killed if anyone was to be shot. It's typically Hollywood – all that happy ending crap. Real life isn't that easy.",Fatal Attraction

Michael Douglas is perfect as Dan Gallagher, the philandering husband. And Anne Archer the flawless, loving, gorgeous, cheated upon wife, Beth. Glenn Close is impeccable as Alex Forest, the deranged other woman.One failing of the movie is that there is never any worldly understanding of why Dan would ever stray from what is clearly a loving and fulfilling marriage. Why would Dan take such a foolish risk with his marriage and wonderful life? Even had Alex not turned into the most monstrous version possible of the other woman -- he was always putting his whole world at risk. And for what reason is never made clear.But the story is ever engrossing. And Fatal Attraction is a not to be missed classic.",Fatal Attraction
185,The_Stuff_of_Dreams,A simple yet complex psychological thriller,10,24 July 2009,"This film is not as simple as it sounds. ""A guy has an affair and the woman is a total psycho"" is not apt in describing it. Michael Douglas had the affair because of a burst of uncontrollable hormones. Anne Archer, his wife, was adequate emotionally and sexually, so she did not drive him away. Their marriage was a happy one, and it made it all the more tragic as Glenn Close, the obsessive, psychopathic woman who Michael Douglas had an affair with, assaulted it. But that is only one complex detail added to the mix. As the movie progresses, and Glenn Close loses her sexy exterior, she is either emotionally vulnerable or monstrously violent, but always insane. In between, she plays sinister mind games, and they sometimes turn deadly or destructive. These games of hers are the beauty of the thrills of this film: they build up unbearable suspense, and it all unravels explosively in the satisfying climax and haunting denouement. Her psychosis is explained vaguely, making her all the more mysterious and all the more unpredictable. She falls in love with Michael Douglas after only one weekend together for reasons we can understand and for reasons we can never understand, grounding her in reality while, at the same time, she wallows in her dark, confused thoughts. And as she does this, she takes the film to sometimes disturbing, always thrilling levels, and the film itself is an exciting ""what if"" tale in which a family is put through a test no other can speak of. All because of a mistake no man can deny of considering to make. All because she won't be ignored...",Fatal Attraction
186,donbren-1,The Forbidden Fruit Ripens Only in Your Juices of Regret,10,15 October 2005,"After finally getting around to seeing this blockbuster hit, I bought the DVD and watched in utter fascination as the incredible crew who put this all together told of the what, hows and whys that each character and scene -- and ending -- was selected. The original ending had been adjudged 'not quite there' and/or 'too predictable' and not nearly as captivating as they seemed to sense the final selection would be. Those closing scenes finally decided upon riveted us all to our seats, as they step-by-step, blow-by-blow sucked us deeper and deeper into the hearts and minds of the characters of our own identification.SUPERB! Only this one-word description even comes close to expressing how the audience rated and appreciated the tension we felt after surviving the suspense and passion of those emotions experienced by characters and audience alike. There was also some relief of possible closure, as each of our characters came to realize just what had transpired, and just how they were effected. Only then could they even hope for a future just slightly resembling that dream their relationship originally had been based on.I rate it ""MUST SEE"" for every person ever tempted toward any type of indiscretion in one's relationship; the catharsis available is as healing as was the previously felt guilt utterly damning.",Fatal Attraction

190,battle-3,a movie that betrays itself,4,30 June 1999,"The movie, of course, was based on a British TV movie and was also significantly altered after test showing audiences didn't like the ending. The intent of the original TV show (which incidently has no violence and an ending that resolves nothing) was to show that both parties were at fault. Yes the male character was unlucky enough to get involved with a mentally fragile young woman but what the hell was he doing getting involved with anyone with his wife and child away for the weekend?  The implication of the TV movie was that the result was going to be the breakup of his marriage.The US movie stuck reasonably close to the TV show.  When test screenings were not favorable, many scenes were recut or reshot including the ending.  In doing so, it betrayed the original intent of the story.  Glenn Close has commented on how disappointed she was in the changes.The result is what was a thought-provoking look at a situation which is relevant to all of us became just another tired psycho on the loose riff.

He was a lawyer who had another affair with an attractive woman. By which the relationship brought him a lot of troubles.Even make his life over.I have to say that Michael had just given his basic performance, nothing special, and nothing would light his career at that moment. Meanwhile, Glen Close did a great job in the movie. We could touch her weird feeling, and her extreme mental troubles. You might even understand what she had done to Michael's family.

192,CWessonSpeaks,NO SPOILERS,7,19 May 2002,"Married, yuppie lawyer Dan Gallagher (Michael Douglas) meets attractive, single book editor Alex Forrest (Glenn Close) and the two have a brief affair while Dan's dewy housewife (Ann Archer) is out of town.    This passionate weekend fling has no rhyme or reason but leaves seriously unpleasant complications in its wake.  Dan, callously assumes it's okay for him to slink back home after the dalliance and has no intention of leaving his wife.  We are not even sure why he's committed adultery as Beth is so supportive and loving.    Far from a shrinking violet, Alex however, now forced into the role of the other woman' refuses to be ignored and takes offense that she's been treated ""like some slut (he) can just bang a few times and throw away"" particularly since he's left her in quite a state'. Even after the Gallagher's move to the suburbs with their small daughter Ellen,  Beth notices an increased  tension in her husband and frequent, anonymous late night phone calls.  Furious at being ignored, Alex demands attention from Dan even if she has to go through his wife and daughter to get it.    A much ballyhooed (and sometimes maligned) nightmare scenario ensues as Alex's frustration and loneliness begins to erode her sense of sanity.   Dan, trapped, ashamed and eventually terrified, watches his family fall apart because of his adultery.In spite of its potboiler narrative and the fact that this will never be everyone's idea of entertainment, Fatal Attraction has a lot going for it. Director Adrian Lyne (known unfairly and glibly as merely a director of kinky garbage like Flashdance) has a surprisingly firm handle on things here as he orchestrates details well and expertly turns the screws of the narrative's many consequences.  Lyne's take no prisoners choice to shoot and edit the film more like a monster movie than a standard domestic drama hurls the provocative narrative right into the viewers lap.  There's a unique, palpable sense of tension and dread here that's unusual for this type of film and is not easily dismissed.   The bleak, late winter skyline of Manhattan and the surrounding affluent burbs are  the perfect backdrop for this threat to the nuclear family myth of the 1980's.  Lyne shoots things low and hazy.  Void of bright colors so that urban scenes turn to a slate texture and the countryside seems a dull grey, the sleek cinematography - sexy at first,  perfectly moves toward casting an increasingly ominous eye. Also, Maurice Jarre's discreet and industrial-like musical score is eerie and menacing.  It's soft and understated throughout and extremely effective.It's important to note the well played performances that flesh out the suspense yarn.  Glenn Close makes Alex so likable at first that we sympathize with her loneliness and understand her frustration.    It's a different sort of turn for this somewhat mannered and Patrician actress who uses those qualities and plays them to the hilt here.  She's vampy and comically slutty when she and Douglas pant through their sex scenes and she's fragile and pitiful as lonely woman desperate to have a relationship. It's when she beings to loose her grip and unravel that Close under plays carefully moving into a sleep walk, stone trance that's very memorable. Archer is suitably sweet and sympathetic as the true victim here and she manages to also pull out all the stops as the narrative calls for it.  She has a genuine warmth that adds credibility to the difficult role of the perfect wife.    Douglas, the quintessential yuppie of the 1980s is perfectly cast and in spite of Dan's selfish arrogance he makes him real and credible.    When he looks at Alex when they first meet there's a hint of the violence and pandemonium that might ensue and he laughs it off.  It's a great moment and his early work here with Close is great to watch.   ""Are you"" she says.   ""What"" he croons.  ""Discreet"" she invites.  ""Oh.. Yes, yes of course"" he smiles with a winning grin.  The script is strongest in these moments of seduction and the later moments of pursuit that find the largely black clad Alex skulking about in Edward Goreyesque postures lurking in Dan's life.    And yes, while much of the film is grim and designed to create tension, there's also a clever sense of humor at work.   The frequent jabs at the house in the country' yuppie bliss are amusing - particularly when Alex, overwhelmed by one family in front of the fireside moment can only VOMIT in her rage and disgust.Upon its release the film was a box office smash that terrified audiences (I still cannot believe the number of adults screaming in the audience during the film's outrageous climax).    For whatever the reason, Fatal Attraction touched a nerve with the public.    Its critical reviews were mixed and the film fell prey to certain feminist critics who felt that the character of Alex was a thinly masked example of the career woman's threat to the working man.    It became clear that some women really disliked the film and felt it undermined the notion of the working woman and that she was lashing out needlessly at the nuclear family myth of the 1980's.    The point of contention still remains in the film and it's a largely personal reaction. Is Alex Forest the moniker of all working, unmarried women?   Is it fair to label the film and the character as wrong and make it the definitive reading? I think not but again, to each his own opinion and the feminist argument is certainly a strong one here.Lastly, the much publicized Madame Butterfly original ending frustrated the test audiences at repeated screenings.  It seemed that the narrative had created such a volatile conflict and the performers had played everything so far to the hilt that the films final moments were extremely disappointing to the viewers.  Begrudgingly, Lyne and company shot an extended, violent and circus like finale that generated screams and applause and clearly added to the film's popularity.   In retrospect the more downbeat and sinister finale seems preferable but one can't deny the box office receipts!    If you are lucky enough to see the Laserdisc or new DVD presentation of the film, it includes the original ending.Again, Not for all tastes but unfairly maligned by too many camps, Fatal Attraction is more than just a trashy, lurid, suspense film - it's a prototype of trashy, lurid, suspense films and it succeeds at being effective.   Even if you find the narrative silly or cliched it remains a film to be reckoned with.  Its big, loud and provocative conflicts touched a large number of people.   While I do have my problems with the film I end up back at the same point and will now credit Janet Maslin in her 1987 NYTimes review of the film that says it all for me - Love it or hate it ""Mr. Lyne has created a soap opera of exceptional power"".   She's right. It's an unsettling mix of lurid melodrama that's bound to involve and absorb most filmgoer's.  If it's been awhile check it out - it's still not a great film but it's smarter than you remember as well as being exceptionally well made and if you've never seen it - it's certainly worth your time if you enjoy thrillers.",Fatal Attraction

Michael Douglas plays the Everyman father extremely tight knight, with a sense of compassion and nativity. Anne archer is really well placed as his wife, and plays it to make us wish she was our wife. But the show stealer is none other than Glenn Close.her character is the centerpiece it is thriller, and her actions display the many outcomes and trials of the film. She doesn't over do the psychotic characterizations, but instead let's it build. Each time we see her, she is even more crazy, and eventually by the end, she is cutting her leg while trying to kill the woman who stands in the way of the man she is crazy for. Her efficient timing allows her to deliver her lines In a cold way that's ends shivers down your spine. But the one question I must ask is why cheat on Glenn close over Anne archer? No offense, but Glenn close is very masculine looking. Just saying. But I could not see anyone but Close playing the part. The directions discreet and well thought with varying angles that give a sense of dizziness, and the script is flawless. All in all, this is a well made thriller that needs to be watched, because every aspect of it is top notch.",Fatal Attraction
196,anthony-d-mills,A real thriller,8,14 September 2021,"The film constantly ups the ante! As Close's character continues to escalate things, it's hard to see what is going to come next.

197,OnlineObserver,A bad decision could cost you your life!,10,16 December 2017,"The film ""Fatal Attraction"" is not only a film, but it's also a warning to all viewers that if you decide to play with fire because your life is getting boring, predictable and tiresome, then don't be shocked if you get burned!A normal househusband has a life that many would say was pretty perfect. He has a beautiful and thoughtful wife. He has a well behaved and intelligent little girl. He has a tidy and well furnished apartment and a well paying job, however, in his opinion, his life situation has become restricted because of his obligations and responsibilities. His perception of his life and his life situation has made him think that he is stuck or tied down and so when he meets another attractive woman who shows interest in him, they begin flirting, establish that he is already married and the flirting continues, they both eventually give into temptation and have a sexual encounter. After the sexual encounter, the difference in perception on each other and on the intimate interaction between them begins to show. He thought of it as a bit of fun, and she begins to develop feelings for him. As the film continues, he starts to see her as a threat to his life as she starts to harass him, play mind games with him and she even resorts to emotional blackmail to stop a man, she is beginning to fall in love with, from leaving her on her own. Her character is clearly emotionally vulnerable and he, not knowing, exploited it because he didn't know her that well. His guilt and regret begins to take over him causing him to lose his temper, threaten her and even become violent. The two characters hurt each other throughout the film and eventually, it begins to hurt everyone else who is involved in his life. The moral of this story, I think, is that every decision we make has a positive and negative impact on our lives. Every decision we make can be short term, however, some can be long term, or even go away and come back to haunt us in the future. Being blind to how good you've got it and not appreciating what you have can persuade people to do selfish things and these selfish acts can effect those we love. We all have obligations and responsibilities in our lives, however, we must not let our inner resentment towards those life factors take over and be the reason for our bad and frivolous decisions. I guess what i'm saying is, everyone should take a step back and really look at what they've got sometimes. Remember, there is always someone worse off than you and being greedy and wanting something you shouldn't have, will cost you and in Dan Gallagher's life, he almost lost everything because of a fling and Alex Forrest lost her life!",Fatal Attraction
198,darktrainfilms,An interesting film....but RELAX!,10,13 April 2007,"Okay folks.I happen to enjoy this film a lot. I would like to just throw out a few things.Number one, this is a movie made for entertainment. I think it is truly amazing how people get worked up over a movie that is this old. RELAX! The plot is not any more unbelievable than a daytime soap opera. There is more infidelity in the air and it is played out in our culture in song and films and plays, etc.I am proud to be an American, but many of my fellow Americans seem to enjoy making sex such a big deal in our entertainment industry.It seems to puzzle other cultures that are more comfortable with it. (By the way, it was a British director remaking a short film.)However, this was a film, and certain things were jazzed up to make the people in the audience react a certain way. You were played, and manipulated. Think of the hero and villains. Well, this has no clear cut good and evil until the rabbit begins a bubbling. Until then, it stays pretty realistic.Number two, trying to read into the film any kind of intellectual or social statement is absurd. That is is like trying to justify a tabloid article as a reliable source of information. It was realistic to a point and then it took off like a roller coaster. But it was the late eighties and today's audiences settle for similar plots with much lesser talent all the time. But I like the film a lot. I don't really care about the character's motivations, they seemed to be well played. I don't mean to go on a rant, but it just feels like some people are opinionated to a silly degree. And some start pulling facts (and quotes)from the film and arguing why this character is so and so and blah blah blah.....Just watch it and like it for what is was. I had more things to point out, but I think you can get the idea. It is silly to get into arguments over old 80's films. However, it truth, that is EXACTLY why the film still is popular today. And to be fair, most people in the movie industry, make a project and then forget about it and move on to the next. They don't set out to make a cult film. It is the audiences, and their collective response to film, that make movies linger on.",Fatal Attraction
199,gsjjones,Never gets old,9,7 October 2020,"33 years ago I was a full time, broke college student working a lousy job in a grocery store. My manager came to work, pale and bug eyed; ""You all have GOT to see this movie!!"" My boyfriend and I did. I crawled under the seat at the ""bunny"" scene and cried all the way home. Suspense out the you know what; rising, boiling tension (water is a central theme in this movie); perfect casting right down to the child, the disinterested cop, and the jovial, yet shocked best friends. It deserves a 10 but gets a point deducted for some obvious continuity goofs; the most glaring of which was the amusement park scene. There are NO rides open north of the Mason Dixon Line in December; certainly not N.Y. My late mother with cognitive/dementia issues watched it for the first time a few years ago. She was riveted and followed the intensity of this cinematic treasure.",Fatal Attraction
200,TheGoforth,"Alex Forrest, as an allegory for AIDS",7,6 February 2016,"It's interesting to me how feminists, specifically single career women, were the ones who were outraged over Alex, when really the character seemed more like a fearful commentary on gay subculture in New York. Alex's queerness is defined in four phases: 1) Her rapacious sexual appetite and the ongoing mystery of her sexual history.2) The framing of her inhabiting desolate, hellish spaces outside of 'healthy, homely' human civilisation (her meatpacking district apartment etc). There's a shot of her spying on Dan and Beth's house in the countryside, where she sees the married couple sat next to a roaring fireplace with their child and bunny rabbit: a Republican approved commercial of the 'all American family'. Alex's face contorts and she recoils from this to vomit: denied a place in heaven, she is condemned to the wilderness. 3) Her drag queen chic (Medusa hair, claw-like red nails and flashy outfits).and finally...4) The idea of her being insidious and diseased - seemingly in the mind, but on closer examination, being presented like a disease unto others. The narrative dictates that Alex is damned as a bringer of pestilence and as such has no recourse but to destroy Dan and Beth's heavenly existence.However unconsciously, I come to the conclusion that the movie resonated because Alex embodied the spectre of AIDS upon an aspirational society.",Fatal Attraction
201,halfridge,Terrifying Horror Thriller!,6,14 September 2021,"Pros: The environments, costume designs, and sets are realistic and believable. Acting is excellent across the board. Pacing is well planned and executed i.e. The movie keeps your attention throughout.Cons: The director is over the top egotistical, which shows in many ways throughout the physical production and release of the movie. Movie packaging is complete with the director's signature in multiple places. There are several cheesy glamor shots of the director on the back of the movie packaging, where one would expect to learn of the movie and plot summary. Worst of all, the director inserted an unskippable ~20 minute boastful advertisement of Fatal Attraction, with spoilers, before the movie began. Much of this introduction is another chance for the director to inflate his ego and deliberately boost his resume, when, in the real world, the viewer just wants to watch the movie. Spoilers reveal critical plot elements before they occur, thus there are fewer surprises, as the viewer already knows what's going to happen. Spoilers ruin movies.",Fatal Attraction
202,aNdzelOt,Scary /w plot holes.,7,25 July 2020,"The conversations and acting in this movie are top notch. My mainly problem with it is Glenn Close character, no overall background on her (just a dark joke on her fathers death).. i thought she inherited some mental illness from her parents, otherwise i can't explain her behavior unless some trauma happened, but if she done it for the first time with this guy (that crazy obsessive mania) it's not believable at all.. also couldn't connect her profession... i thought for a second that she was the lady they spoke about at their job meeting (?!...) sleeping with other man in powerful positions which will add to her slutty mannerism. Further in the film it looks like she doesn't go to work anymore (beside that one time when Michael's character breaks in her apartment..) and they never meet at work too.. is the case closed..? Well in the end i think this movie is made mostly for the vibe of psycho scary at moments.. but lacks plot, more personality and only drifts on marriage and faithfulness as universal theme.",Fatal Attraction

Personally, I have always enjoyed this movie, most of all because of Close's and Archer's actings -not so for Douglas, although I think I doesn't play bad at all-. All I dislike has got to do with Lyne's conception of cinema -videoclip tone mostly, and cheap sensationalism supposed to generate discussion-, but I think it works as diversion. I'm not spoiling, but... Can whoever has seen it believe the final? I have not seen the original, second one but, having read about it, I think it's more coherent and less effective. About the feminist reading, I don't know for sure if Dearden's conception of the question indeed does betrail a male-phalocentrist vission of independent woman. But, remember, if you have seen Jacob's ladder, An indecent proposal or Lolita's remake that Lyne is a director -a very good one indeed, I think, despite what I have said before-, who enjoys treating and filming stories that generate ambiguity, although sometimes the discussion makes no sense. Worth seeing, after all.",Fatal Attraction

207,TerpStudent,A Horror Film and a Tragedy,10,1 January 2013,"You will be horrified by Glenn Close's realistically demented performance of an outwardly gorgeous woman with severe emotional instabilities. The most frightening aspect is that she isn't a monster; she isn't Michael Myers. You have to admit she's a real vulnerable person who has a damaged history with men which obliterated her trust in them, so her longing for their affection drives her into obsessive or destructive relationships, and for this you feel sorry for her. But paradoxically her inability to deal with her dysfunction drives her to lash out at the men who try to love her or care for her.The premise of this film is of an all American family man living the dream who goes astray, falling victim to his lust for another woman and incidentally falling victim to her wrath when he leaves.That's why I consider this both a horror film and a tragedy because of the ending. Alex didn't deserve the fate she got. She was mentally ill and therefore not responsible for her actions. She instead deserved institutionalization in a mental hospital where she could be cared for and treated until she could resume a normal life. I'm so sick of ""villains"" in movies, who are actually just victims of their own mental illness, getting killed in the end when it isn't fair or really necessary.",Fatal Attraction

While watching the movie I actually figured she would kill herself after he had left, and he would get the blame. On recommendation of other reviewers I looked up the original ending. I was pleasantly surprised to find the ending I was expecting. Although, that ending is more logical, it it less thrilling than the one we ended up with in the movie.

Maybe it's too entertaining and not overly thought out for you bores? And it's the entertaining factor which is constant from the moment Michael makes eye contact with Glenn Close, to the haunting music in the end credits.This was a big movie in 1987. Everyone I knew in 1987 loved it. The acting from Glenn Close was Oscar worthy! She had that crazy psychopath persona down to a tee. Douglas is my favourite actor and he has that voice that is instantly recognisable and a charm which you rarely see today. His chemistry with Close is electric! Anne Archer is very natural and the little girl was adorable. The tension and on the edge of your seat feeling Close and Douglas create with this looney tune who turns from screw buddy to worst enemy keeps you glued to the screen, and that's what great acting does. The music in the end credits is also very haunting and beautiful, and adds to the movie's excellence.If anyone rates this movie lower than a 8 then you seriously need to learn to live a little! It's a classic thriller and I love it!",Fatal Attraction

213,PermanentRevolutionary,Doesn't Add Up,4,1 October 2012,"A few days before I watched this film, I had viewed Clint Eastwood's ""Play Misty for Me,"" which is a terribly amateurish first directorial effort from the actor-turned-director. The plot for these two films is pretty much the same--man has affair with crazy woman, man assumes it's just a quick fling, crazy woman assumes it's love, and when she fails to convince man to see it the same way, crazy woman goes crazy. ""Fatal Attraction,"" which was a giant hit when released in 1987, is the superior film of the two mainly because Adrian Lyne is a superior filmmaker who is better at constructing a drama (Eastwood has improved somewhat since 1971 when ""Misty"" came out).Having said that, this film is fairly atrocious. We are expected to believe that a man (Michael Douglas) with a beautiful, adoring wife and daughter is willing to risk his 9-year marriage and family life by having an affair with a woman he just meets while his wife and kid are away visiting her parents. And, it must be said, the woman is not anywhere near as attractive as his own wife (it's Glenn Close circa 1987). If you're going to cheat on your wife, wouldn't you want to cheat up? Furthermore, once the affair concludes, Douglas seems not the slightest bit guilty or uncomfortable around his wife (if anything, he seems to love her more, showing so much affection that his wife suggests she should go away more often).And I don't know about you, but I don't find much appealing in films with female protagonists who are inexplicably crazy and evil and who lure men in with the promise of sex and then become murderous when the guy inevitably decides not to stick around. There is a definite whiff of misogyny in the air about such films.""Fatal Attraction"" falls into the ""horror/thriller"" category. Close does a good job of behaving deranged, but still I wouldn't say the movie is so much scary as it is just off-putting. Douglas gives his usual smarmy, pleased-wth-himself performance, and actress Anne Archer, Douglas's wife here, is a treat who elicits genuine sympathy from the viewer.4/10.",Fatal Attraction

Michael Douglas, Glenn Close, and Anne Archer are all to be commended for making this film realistic and believable.From the outset, the film runs at a good pace and is compelling viewing. I still find it quite eerie during both the bunny boiling scene and also when Alex has cut her wrists whilst Madam Butterfly is playing in the background.The scene where Dan and Alex have sex in the sink (although it looks more to me like on the worktop/counter) makes the film both believable and shows the passion and excitement that makes their affair more realistic to the viewer.Overall still an excellent film and definitely one to watch.",Fatal Attraction

The movie suffers terribly from this! Huge mistake! None the less still excellent! Glenn Close should have won an Academy Award for this ! I can not help but think that because the ending was changed. That prevented her from the receiving the award! No other movie had ever tackled infidelity in a marriage quite like this one did, and no movie since has surpassed it in those regards, since! My biggest problem with the film is that they changed the original ending and the ending always seemed fabricated to me! The reason being is that it should not have been changed!

Her portrayal of the mentally unstable Alex Forrest is hauntingly believable, and it is clear that she did her research and has genuine acting talent. Although Michael Douglas plays a good Dan Gallagher, I think there was potential for some more character where he was concerned. When Dan finally admits to his wife that he has had an affair, I thought there needed to me more to the scene- a bigger connecting of the dots for Anne Archer, and more difficulty in relaying his infidelity by Michael Douglas.Also, I was certain- CERTAIN that it would be revealed in the end that Alex Forrest was, in fact, not pregnant!

It it was fiction, would have been just fine, but the story has roots in our society and I do not agree with whats shown in the movie and I believe everyone in their heart feels the same. Its just sick to see every one on one side and one helpless pregnant woman who said the right thing, that men can not go and have what they want from women and then just forget about it.

She meets Dan Gallagher and is instantly attracted to him and latches onto him and isolates herself from everyone except Dan. Suddenly Alex puts a plan into effect to get him to fall in love with her and leave his wife so they can be together by any means necessary. I think this movie was thrilling and predictable.

224,garrison-ball,Great sound and believable story combine for a chilling effect!,8,28 April 2011,"***Warning: I have tried to keep spoilers in this review to a minimum, but you may want to skip this one if you want the film to be a surprise.***This film will certainly make any married man think twice before cheating! The excellent use of editing, sound, and music drive this thriller home. Even the title of the movie is a succinct preview of the greater theme present throughout the film; foreboding and mysterious. Obviously, at least one of the main characters will die because of the affair. The question that haunts you throughout the storyline is: which one? The film begins by showing Dan Gallagher as a kind, but sexually frustrated family man. With his wife gone for the weekend, his fling with the seemingly innocent Alex appears to be harmless fun. But his indiscretion begins to catch up with him soon. Alex's sociopathic tendencies begin to become apparent as she begins to harass Dan at work, calling and visiting him regularly. What seemed like a one night stand becomes a haunting and difficult ordeal. The violence, emotion, and unpredictability throughout the show will make it impossible to look away. Fatal Attraction is a must-see thriller and a pioneer in its genre. This film will suck you in and make you empathize with Dan and his loving wife Beth. The amount of detail and emotion director Adrian Lyne and his team included in the film makes it impossible to watch with detachment. If you have ever known or dated a sociopath, you will certainly see the accuracy with which Alex's behavior was portrayed. My favorite scene exposing her personality and bipolar state is when she listens to Madame Butterfly, staring blankly into space and flicking the lamp on and off. Her obsession, and the lengths she will go to in order to get what she wants, is oddly familiar and simultaneously eerie. A key component of this film is the dead-on use of sound editing and music. These allow us to share Dan's attraction and sense of connection with Alex, and later his sense of dread as she ruthlessly attacks everything he loves. From the whisper of their adolescent, flirting banter in the beginning to the scream of the teakettle near the end, the choice of sound is appropriate and fitting for this storyline. If you liked other thrillers such as Cape Fear, Fatal Attraction will be right up your alley. Marital infidelity will never seem the same.",Fatal Attraction

The way she stomped around, it seems that only a man could pull that off. ""Hey buddy! Have you ever done it in an elevata?"" When they had to show a female face, they shot Glenn Close's face as the woman. Either that or Glenn Close is really a male. All the screaming seemed guttural like a male voice. Ditto for the ""girl"" child Ellen. Who cast this movie? A transsexual? Other than that, it was quite entertaining.

227,adashen,In our society?,8,9 January 2006,"What a common material but a classical performance it is! The closing scenes that Alex was shoot by the Dan's wife for protecting family from her crazy activities was occurred in my favorite movie ""Bridget Jones's Diary"". I was wondering why it was putted there. Just got it after watched the movie today. It was mention that an over of the special relationship between the man who looking for only excited night and the 'silly' girl. Now I am wondering the end of the story that the girl who was going to destroy the other's family was killed and how about the man who attracted her into this game? The man returned to the happy family at the end, is it the common consequence of this kind of relationship? Here is another news that I heard today, a killed case that haven't been solved for 5 years long in Hongkong because it involved some politician. That was a case about a model was found that killed in her room for 4 year long. Probably the politician knew something since they had some special relationship for almost 10 years and she died in the apartment which rented by him. Now a day, rich or successful business men are such attractive to girls and those top men aware that compare to looking for prostitute, to have a girl who would like to hid and stay only for him is usually safer and cheaper. But the girl has to be quiet and never trouble anything otherwise the above cases would just happened one more time. How selfish they are! And, How fascinated they are! To the girls! So whose fault is here? We could not say anyone's. This is what our society has been and we don't know how long this will be? A result of modernization, people said. Sadly there are 10 more items on the list of problems of modernization but 3 items on the list as the solutions. A Christian friend said, we should remind the people to aware, to follow the words of God. It is right!

I own the video, and I do not own many videos; this was the perfect see-it-over-and-over film. Even now, at age 50+, there are scenes that are the best I have ever witnessed in a movie. Douglas portrayed many men who finds his lover pregnant, though perhaps a bit more understanding in his initial attempt to support the woman. Close portrayed the unexpressed emotions of many women who have been in this situation, anger personified and vengeance motivated. The fact that her mental makeup was destroyed prior to her affair makes no difference in the expression of emotions, until, of course, she takes her emotions out on the family. Men, take notice! This could happen to you if you choose to have an affair. :)",Fatal Attraction
229,legend_today,one of life's little lessons,10,20 April 2006,"one thing about this movie that has always bothered me is the view so many people have regarding who is the victim and who is the perpetrator. most people i've spoken with seem happy to point the finger at glenn close as the bad guy. it's an easy decision to come to, she brandishes a knife with too great of ease, she likes her jambalaya real fresh, and she believes it's important to maintain open lines of communication with everyone. what i want to know is why everyone is so quick to let michael douglas off the hook? yeah, he's more adept at keeping surface appearances buffed and polished, but isn't he the one who really is to blame for all this? isn't he the one who committed adultery the second his wife turned her back on him? isn't he the one who thought he could just bang glenn close's alex forrest and then push her aside once wife-y and child return from the country and it is time to resume the act of domestic bliss? sure, alex is one crazy little cookie, but ultimately had he thought, had he taken the time to get to know this women before he banged her, all of this could have been avoided.",Fatal Attraction
