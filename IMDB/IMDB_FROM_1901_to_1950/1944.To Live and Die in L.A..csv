0,Leofwine_draca,Style to spare,8,7 May 2021,"A decent cop thriller from William Friedkin. Maybe by this stage it's not as good as the classic THE FRENCH CONNECTION but it still packs a punch and is an effective slice of sun-drenched noir with a very slick, stylish and visual MIAMI VICE feel to it. William Petersen is a good choice for volatile lead - even better in MANHUNTER - and Willem Dafoe is of course exemplary as the villain of the piece. There are good twists and turns and character darkness along the way, alongside a car chase that stands out (although isn't personally one of the best for me). A fine little film overall.",To Live and Die in L.A.
1,SnoopyStyle,slick 80s thriller,8,23 January 2016,Secret service agents Jimmy Hart and Richard Chance (William Petersen) thwart an Islamic terrorist during a Presidential visit. Hart has a few days left before retirement. He tries to investigate and gets killed by counterfeiter Eric Masters (Willem Dafoe). Chance vows to take him down. He gets John Vukovich (John Pankow) as his new partner. They catch Masters' delivery boy Carl Cody (John Turturro). Masters' lawyer Bob Grimes (Dean Stockwell) says Cody has to do 3 years. Chance's C.I. Ruth Lanier (Darlanne Fluegel) directs them to lawyer Max Waxman. Waxman was Cody's last stop and Masters suspects he set them up. Masters and his girlfriend Bianca Torres (Debra Feuer) go to demand repayment and ends up killing him. Chance steals Waxman's black book as he becomes more morally corrupt in order to take down Masters.William Friedkin delivers a slick thriller of amoral cops and immoral everyone else. I love Dafoe's montage of counterfeiting. Friedkin delivers so many great action scenes. The wrong way car chase is the highlight and probably the height of his action work. It is so slick and so stylized that I accept the avant-garde artsy stuff. It fits into the movie. It also has an early bungee jump on film. This is one of the most fun 80s action thriller filled with relatively unknown actors at the time. I can't help but think of Michael Mann who was showrunning Miami Vice TV show at the time.,To Live and Die in L.A.
2,claudio_carvalho,Excellent Non-Stop Action And Politically Incorrect Police Story,8,4 June 2005,"In Los Angeles, the secret agent Richard Chance (William L. Petersen) loses his partner and friend Jim Hart (Michael Greene) in an investigation of counterfeit, two days before the retirement of Jim. The agent John Vukovich (John Pankow) is assigned to work with Chance, who is obsessed to capture Eric 'Rick' Masters (Willem Dafoe), the criminal responsible for the death of Jim. Chance risks his partner and his own career, trying to arrest Rick.""To Live and Die in L.A"" is an excellent non-stop action movie, having an excellent pacing and being a politically incorrect police story. All the characters are amoral, dirty and sordid, and it is impossible to feel sympathy for any of them. There are excellent scenes, such as the car chase in the streets of Los Angeles, or the surprising lethal shooting in the end of the story. The DVD shows a commercial alternative ending of the story, fortunately not accepted by the director William Friedkin. The unpredictable and credible end as it is makes the great difference of this outstanding movie. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Viver e Morrer em Los Angeles"" (""To Live and Die in Los Angeles"")",To Live and Die in L.A.
3,gavin6942,An Over-the-Top Action Film,8,14 November 2016,"A fearless Secret Service agent (William Petersen) will stop at nothing to bring down the counterfeiter (Willem Dafoe) who killed his partner (Michael Greene).As with many movies, this one began as a novel by a former Secret Service agent. Director William Friedkin read the book and loved it, attracted to what he saw as a ""surreal"" aspect of the Service: the balance of one day living the high life with the president and the next chasing counterfeiters through the slums of America. How much of the novel was based on fact is open to debate (clearly some parts of the film are not realistic). For the parts that are factual, you have to admire Friedkin's attention to detail. The scenes of twenty dollar bills being counterfeited were overseen by a man who had actually served time for counterfeiting (unfortunately left unnamed). What we see is not just Hollywood, but an actual demonstration of how the process was really done. (The bills made on screen were so real, in fact, that the Treasury Department hounded Friedkin and prop master Barry Bedig for months.)Friedkin also puts his actors in some unusual positions, creating amazing results. If he and Petersen are to be believed, the script was very fluid and often scenes that should have been shorter (if the script was followed) kept going as long as the actors would stay in character. For example, much of the ""bagman scene"" is allegedly unscripted -- the briefcase busting open, the physical confrontation. Other scenes were filmed when actors thought it was only a rehearsal, meaning much of the film is done in one take. For all of this to play out so perfectly through sheer improvisation is just incredible and creates some of the most memorable scenes.There is a great deal to admire about this film. The acting is great, and even better in retrospect given that these are the early roles of some big names. The soundtrack is thumping, and makes Wang Chung seem better than they are often perceived. The action is over the top and at times unbelievable, but this only adds to the appeal. And the cinematography is great -- there are a few mirror shots, for example, which are expertly lined up and crafted. And the methods needed to follow such an intricate chase scene? Wow. Just wow.The car chase runs a bit long, but this is excusable because it adds to that surreal quality the film was going for. What bothered me was the character played by John Turturro. He has a steady subplot throughout the picture, but seems to just magically disappear at one point. It seems like his story is built up but never finished. Is there a cut scene, or did something go over my head?The Blu-ray from Shout! Factory is ridiculously impressive. From a previous release, they ported over the audio commentary with director William Friedkin and kept the featurette ""Counterfeit World: The Making Of To Live And Die In L.A."". But that was only the beginning, because they brought us a 4K scan of the negative supervised and approved by Friedkin, so you know the movie has never looked better. And there are plenty of new interviews: 20 minutes with star William Petersen (whose career took off following this film) who explains how Gary Sinise got him the part, stunt coordinator Buddy Joe Hooker, Wang Chung (Jack Hues And Nick Feldman), actress Debra Feuer and actor Dwier Brown.",To Live and Die in L.A.
4,rmax304823,Competent crime thriller.,7,4 May 2006,"It's a genre movie but the director, William Friedkin, knows how to put them together effectively.We have two Secret Service agents. One (Peterson) is a reckless rule-defying loose cannon; his partner (Pankow) is more principled, or uptight, if you like. Peterson bungee jumps from high bridges. During a chase, when Peterson is laughing, Pankow is grimacing with anxiety.Their prey is a master counterfeiter (DaFoe). DaFoe is like neither of the cops. He's extremely organized. He tells the truth and fulfills his promises. He's an artist, not only with engraved plates but with a paint brush. A man of his word. He really only has one kink -- he's a remorseless cold-blooded killer when it's in his interests to be one. And when he gets burned up, he REALLY gets burned up. DaFoe loses in the end, but then everyone loses, one way or another.The best-known scene (justifiably) is the car chase that takes place in the wrong direction, against traffic, on the Long Beach Freeway. It is gripping, precisely choreographed, and must have been dangerous to shoot. These are not computer-generated images either. That eighteen wheeler we see jackknifing among dozens of whirling cars is a real eighteen wheeler jackknifing among dozens of whirling cars. No exciting music during the pursuit, only the sound of engines in overdrive and vehicle horns shrieking alarms in the key of F. The high-speed pursuit by this time, though, was not an original idea. It was original with ""Bullitt"" (1968), and that's still the best example. After ""Bullitt"" this car chase -- ALL car chases -- were variations on a theme of director Peter Yates, a former racing car driver himself, and Philip D'Antonio.Friedkin has directed with a maximum of speed and action scenes, none of them gratuitous. Lots of shots of people running full tilt along city streets. Plenty of violence, although it isn't wallowed in. It's not a Bruce Willis action/comedy. There are few dull moments to bore the kids. Really, this is one of the better efforts of Friedkin and his editor. For instance, there is a shot between DaFoe's burning the funny money and Peterson's meeting with the judge. It's simply a high-angle shot of a dozen pedestrians walking through the plaza in front of a government building. But Friedkin frames it so that, from this distance, the equidistant palm trees loom over the people and throw lengthy shadows across the tiles of the pavement. The composition is impressive. If the performances don't shoot out the lights, they get the job done in a most professional manner. Peterson is physically nimble and obviously does most of his own stunts. He played football at school, and it shows. And the parts are complex too. The bad guys don't fit easily into any stereotypes, except one ham-handed heavy who spits on his victims after blowing their heads off. The good guys are hardly saintly. Peterson's character has a snitch working for him, Darlanne Fluegel, a tall thin sexy blond. He's keeping her out of jail, and in return she feeds him information and certain other perquisites. When she turns to him for comfort or understanding, he is off on some other planet, frantically chattering on about basketball while she weeps. ""What would you do if I STOPPED giving you information?"", she asks Peterson at one point. ""I'd revoke your parole and send you back to the joint,"" he answers tonelessly. ""Would you do that? Would you REALLY do that?"" He turns and walks out the door without a word. He's really a mean guy. Mean to everyone, including his new partner, Pankow.Three particularly enjoyable features of the film. The location shooting and photography by Robby Muller is great. He manages to make smoggy San Pedro look almost artistic with its oil refineries and its multitude of distant floodlights providing patterns of globular glow. ""The stars are God's eyes,"" says Fluegel to Peterson, who disagrees with her. One advantage of living in San Pedro is access to Papadakis Tavern. Great Greek food. Tell Nick I sent you.Wang Chung's theme music is simple but it zaps you with its percussion and its simple, pounding succession of four electronic notes. Carl Orff with syncopation. A distant train rushing through a flat landscape is introduced by a passage for what sounds like Peruvian nose flutes or shakuhachis.Then there is the performance of Dean Stockwell as an expensive and expert criminal defense lawyer. He underplays the part, but he's just fine. Our two heroes have just stolen fifty thousand dollars from the FBI and Pankow explains the situation to Stockwell, who gives him a few words of advice and adds, ""Of course I can't be directly involved in this."" ""How much would it cost for you to be indirectly involved?"" asks Pankow. Stockwell looks up at him, puffs a cigar, and answers smoothly, ""Fifty thousand dollars."" Nobody laughs. Friedkin knows how to lay out a funny line.",To Live and Die in L.A.
5,Quinoa1984,no-holds-barred and excellent example in unsympathetic cops and criminals story,9,24 August 2009,"To Live and Die in L.A. sounds like the title of a film-noir, and it suits that the film is one of those super-harsh neo-noirs with an anti-hero secret service agent and his partner, a (somewhat?) deranged counterfeit artist, and a femme fatale or two thrown in. It's also so hard-hitting it'll put off some. It only skirts the conventions: investigation of a counterfeiter (Willem Dafoe), undercover tactics, attempts to get informants, etc. But it's also the kind of thriller where you really don't know what will happen next. Informant will play ball? Yeah right. Richard Chance's partner John will do whatever he wants? Perhaps, but not on the same level of agreement (certainly not during an insane car chase across LA). And what about the striking blonde woman in Richard Chance's life? Well, that's a whole other story that can only get so much time, if you know what I mean.It's definitely comparable to the French Connection, and I'm sure William Friedkin would be fine with the comparisons. And, really, his film here has the a similar level of intensity to the performances - there's not one here that doesn't co Especially from Peterson, who is out to just get his adrenaline completely off the charts in some scenes, but in others he can sit calmly- scarily even- with a look or other that just suggests his character's drive to get a charge, much like the bungee jumps. Of course Dafoe here makes his breakthrough performance, right on the cusp of Platoon and Last Temptation of Christ, a skeevy and wicked but alluring turn as Masters, who when he smiles looks as though he doesn't have human teeth - which in this case is a really big help(!) But really, try and take your eyes off of Dafoe (not just here but in any performance) and you'll miss an actor who is alive and kicking even when he's just sitting back in a sauna or, on the other extreme, close to being burnt to pieces.Also good to note are Debra Feuer, John Pankow and of course John Tuturro in supporting roles, since they all stand out as well. Friedkin, along with his actors, sets up reality as much as possible, another tie to French Connection and his work in general. When the fake money is printed its printed as it would be back in 1985. Things feel and look authentic, and shot in the most dangerous parts and areas of greater Los Angeles, including the bit of that car chase in the concrete valley where one might expect actual gangs to pop out on camera as opposed to the characters with guns. And Friedkin's got an excellent, albeit unlikely cinematographer with Robby Mueller (to my slight disappointment he didn't shoot the car chase, though he didn't know how from a background of Wim Wenders). The film has realistic set-pieces, but also some surreal ones too with that theater group or just the noir-look in general, red and green lights come out on characters, warm contrasts, and the slightest (or darkest) of shadows. You want a gritty but artistic look, you got it here.Oh, the film is dated, don't get me wrong, reader. This is *very* 1980's when it comes to the music and some of the cars (well, with Dafoe's car anyway) and the hair and some of the clothes. Actually, the music more than anything threw me off - picture if suddenly in French Connection they threw in hippie music. Doesn't quite fit, does it? But if you can look past this, then the rest of the picture, with its uncompromised ending and gut-churning violence, it delivers the goods. Especially, I should note, the big car chase. It's almost as if Friedkin realized, 'hey, I've done this before already, I knocked it out of the park then, won an Oscar, now what do I do?' And the answer, naturally, was to make a bat-s*** crazy car chase. I'm not saying it's one of the all-time greats, but it's certainly in a top-tier of the craziest, like Blues Brothers style only meant to be taken seriously. And I loved every second of it.",To Live and Die in L.A.
6,edwagreen,Double Cross in L.A. -Live & Die in L.A. **1/2,6,17 February 2013,"The car chase scenes are great, especially when the agents car is going the wrong way along a highway.The picture really gets going when an agent's informer gal double crosses him and lets him think that the guy he is after is into counterfeiting when in reality, the latter is an agent as well. When that agent is killed, our guy shall refuse to turn state's evidence against his partner. Wait until you see the ending of this film, it shows that there is no absolute honor among agents as well, especially in death.Dean Stockwell co-stars as a shady attorney and Willem De Foe is that very nasty counterfeiter who shall stop at nothing to obtain his objectives, even if it means murder.This often gritty tale has plenty of action and filled with violence within the context of the story.",To Live and Die in L.A.
7,wes-connors,"William, William, Willem & John",8,6 July 2011,"After his veteran partner is shot dead in the line of duty, ""Federal agent Richard Chance (William L. Petersen) has a score to settle, and he's through playing by the rules. Whether that means blackmailing a beautiful parolee, disobeying direct orders or hurtling the wrong way down a crowded freeway, he vows to take down a murderous counterfeiter (Willem Dafoe) by any means necessary. But as the stakes grow higher, will Chance's obsession with vengeance ultimately destroy him?"" descriptively asks the MGM Home Video team. Director William Friedkin, who thrilled filmgoers in the 1970s, showed he can still pack a punch, with one of the best action thrillers of the 1980s. ""To Live and Die in L.A."" features the usual lot of sinfully sleazy Los Angeles characters, showing off how they can be more full frontal in the movies. The film took a chance by introducing Mr. Peterson as a star; in a noticeably ballsy performance, he was an instant anti-hero. His screen partners are fine, too. The film is paced exceptionally well, with an arresting car chase. Better run for it. ******** To Live and Die in L.A.

9,hitchcockthelegend,"That doesn't mean I'm gonna roll over and play informer. If you're looking for a pigeon, go to the park.",8,14 November 2012,"To Live and Die in L.A. is directed by William Friedkin who co-adapts the screenplay with Gerald Petievich from Petievich's own novel. It stars William Petersen, Wiiliam Dafoe, John Pankow, Debra Feuer, John Turturo, Darlanne Fluegel and Dean Stockwell. Music is by Wang Chung and cinematography by Robby Muller.Secret Service agent Richard Chance (Petersen) swears to bring down those responsible for the death of his partner...Critics of the time were very divided on the quality of Friedkin's movie, with some being way off the mark by trying to put it in the same ball park as TV show Miami Vice! On reflection you like to think that many of those critics view it now and see just how damn down and gritty it actually is. A common misconception is that the film wasn't supported by the paying public, with some quarters suggesting it flopped, not so since it cleared $10 million in profit in North America alone.The story is set over 41 days in December and January, but forget any notion that this has any hint of the Christmas holidays, for there is no joy here. This trawls the unglamourous side of Los Angeles, crime and corruption dwells here in a world of strip joints and working class graft locales. There are no heroes either, all characters are either flawed or trapped by their situation, alienation figures prominently, as does fatal obsession, and Robby Muller's photography dovetails with the character's mental health by way of colour and composition. In short, this is classic neo-noir.As an action film it also scores high, with the brutal violence handled with kinetic assurance by Friedkin, while the ""famous"" car chase that precedes the finale is worthy of all the praise thrown its way over the years. Taking six weeks to shoot, and with Friedkin challenging himself to trump the car chase in The French Connection, it's a dizzying array of accelerated thrusts, spins and nail biting breathlessness, one of the finest car chases in cinematic history for sure. That finale that follows also proves to be a throat grabber, no cop-outs here as Friedkin sneakily put in the ending that the studio didn't want. The script stings with snide asides and moody exchanges and a splendid cast are led by Petersen and Dafoe turning in classical noir protagonist/antagonist portrayals.It's very 80s, Wang Chung's electro synth musical score ensures that is the case, as do the garish reds and greens that adorn the opening credits, but this is a good thing, for it's not a film of god awful mullets and spangle dressage. A moody and miserable film it is, and thankfully so. 8/10",To Live and Die in L.A.
10,Theo Robertson,MAIMI VICE Meets Fatboy Slim,5,19 February 2004,TO LIVE AND DIE IN LA is a fair enough thriller but there is a bit of a problem watching it in 2004 and is that it`s very dated . Check out the fashions of having cops wearing their padded shoulder jackets with their sleeves rolled up . Very 1980s . Also check out the directing style of orange sunlight casting its glow on interiors as an intrusive pop track plays . It`s impossible to watch this movie without being reminded of MAIMI VICE Something else I noticed was a scene straight after a car chase ( You won`t need reminding of what I`m talking about . If you`ve seen this movie you`ll know what car chase I`m talking about ) when the two cops are sitting on a car in a rundown part of town . If you look closely you can see a trio of funky black geezers walking past holding radios to their ears . They`re almost dancing through the scene which instantly reminded me of the video of the Fatboy Slim video ROCKERFALLAH SKANK Check it now . Funk show brother Right about now .

11,Scarecrow-88,To Live and Die in LA,9,19 May 2007,"Secret Service Agent Richard Chance(William Peterson, who is brooding with intensity)wants counterfeiter Eric Masters(Willem Dafoe, wonderfully slimy with an underlying menace)really bad for the murder of his partner Jim(Michael Greene), who was two days to retirement. They had been working hard on a case against Eric and Jim had found the location where he was creating the ""funny money"". Unfortunately Jim goes there alone and Eric was hidden along with his ""iceman"" Jack(Jack Hoar)plug him. Assigned a new partner, John Vukovich(John Pankow, an actor I think has always been underrated)whose father and grandfather were cops, Richard will do whatever it takes to bring Eric to justice. But, Richard's blinded need for revenge causes many goofs and problems as he doesn't operate through proper channels(especially when Richard steals money from an FBI agent he believes is just a hood). Richard has an informant, Ruth(the sexy Darlanne Fluegel who has a steamy sexual encounter with Peterson as both appear in the throes of quiet lustful abandon)he keeps out on parole who often feeds him bits to work from especially concerning specific targets he presently goes after. She, however, may've set up Richard with a bogus hood who is supposedly carrying hard cash for a diamond trade-off which leads to his and John's foiling a FBI sting. In a humdinger of a car-chase through the streets and freeways of LA, Richard and John try to elude an army of FBI agents out to catch them. That money they attained from the FBI agent Richard and John thought was a hood, is what they plan to use to pay an up-front cost to Eric for funny money so that he will be caught in the act. The meeting is arranged and everything seems to be in order, but this isn't a typical by-the-numbers cop drama and ends in tragedy.John Turturro has a memorable role as a bag man for Eric who gets caught carrying the funny money, but after being sprung by Richard to show him where the new counterfeit factory is located, escapes by duping the agent(..using a supposed sick daughter in the hospital as a means to trick Richard). Debra Feuer has the role of Bianca, a lover of Eric's who also assists him in various duties regarding his counterfeiting practices. Dean Stockwell has a role as Eric's dirty lawyer. Steve James has a role as a street worker for Eric who supplies his people with the funny money turning quite a profit for them both until one tries to betray the other.Of note is Robby Müller's fantastic photography of LA really bringing a color and grit to the look of the city at this time in the mid-80's. Müller, who also lensed Wim Wenders' Paris, Texas a year prior to this film, really has a way of showing the lights from a distance and steam from the city allowing us to feel the energy and atmosphere of LA. Also, Wang Chung's electronic score provides a thumping beat that matches the intensity and energy of the film's pace and style.",To Live and Die in L.A.
12,Hey_Sweden,"Not on the level of ""The French Connection"", but still pretty damn good.",8,2 July 2012,"Director William Friedkins' crime thriller ""To Live and Die in L.A."" is highly enjoyable for the way it takes a gritty, sleazy, unglamourous look at various cops and criminals. William Petersen of 'C.S.I.' fame, in his first starring role, plays Richard Chance, a Secret Service agent on the trail of a murderous counterfeiter, Eric Masters (Willem Dafoe), who'd killed Chances' partner Jim Hart (Michael Greene). Chance is newly partnered with a Federal agent named John Vukovich (John Pankow) as he then proceeds to break as many rules as he can, and do whatever it takes, to take down the bad guy.Now, we've all seen maverick protagonists in movies before, guys who gleefully toss protocol aside, and protagonists who had their flaws, but the difference here is Chance is not only corrupt but not terribly bright. He does make some serious mistakes. Now, by this movies' very nature it will be hard for some viewers to truly enjoy it (they'll wonder who it is they should be rooting for), but this makes ""To Live and Die in L.A."" compelling in its own sordid way. It tells a grim story, and shows a fair bit of brevity in the way it resolves itself. The characters aren't about to redeem themselves if they can help it.Friedkin and company, including renowned cinematographer Robby Muller, capture on film a nicely seedy vision of Los Angeles, and the gorgeous shots are accompanied by the songs and score of pop group Wang Chung, whose career shone brightly if briefly in the 1980s.The cast is all great, with Pankow going through the biggest character arc. In support are the always cool Steve James, lovely ladies Darlanne Fluegel and Debra Feuer, John Turturro, Dean Stockwell, filmmaker Robert Downey (""Putney Swope""), Christopher Allport, and Valentin de Vargas, with a small, non-speaking bit for future 'Frasier' and 'Hot in Cleveland' actress Jane Leeves and an uncredited one for Gary Cole.This is slick, stylish, violent stuff; not for all tastes, naturally, but it's got good action (one extended chase sequence is especially riveting) and great atmosphere.

What prevents the film from having a greater impact is the characters - they are hollow. Willem Dafoe is impressive in one of his first important roles, but William Petersen is bland in his film debut, and so is John Pankow.

Chance risks both his partners and his own career, trying to arrest Rick....As with every decade since the seventies, Friedkin does something so blindingly brilliant, it's easy to see why he is one of the best auteur's going.This shouldn't be much, it's the typical eighties cop,movie where the main guy loses his partner, gets another one assigned to him, and then goes for the bad guy, but then in Friedkins hands, it will always be something different to the average.Peterson is great as Chance, an agent who doesn't play by the rules and loses friends and other things because of this.And then there is Dafoe, who is the epitome of the eighties. His house is cool, he burns painting, and he launders money to Wang Chung. It's all very Miami Vice, the style it's shot and the way the characters are dressed, but include one of the best car chases of the eighties, and a third act shocker that made the studio very uncomfortable, and you have a movie that stands out from all the other cop dramas from this era.It's well acted, well produced, and the editing is wonderful.It's a genuine definition of a lost classic.",To Live and Die in L.A.
19,zetes,Petersen and Pankow are the worst possible actors to build a movie around,5,6 March 2011,"I'd heard some good things about this one, but it didn't do anything for me. It felt almost like a stumbling Friedkin trying to remind his audience that he once made The French Connection, and that it was awesome. Well, if you love The French Connection, To Live and Die in L.A. might work for you. I thought it was just okay, so this one feels like a cheap imitation. Friedkin ups the ante by making the law enforcement protagonists (secret service agents played by William Petersen and John Pankow) even more corrupt and gritty than the leads of The French Connection. I kind of missed the point that we weren't supposed to entirely approve of the characters there. I thought Friedkin approved of their corruption. These guys are far more obviously evil, nearly as bad as the villains of the picture. Unfortunately, they're both not only unlikeable, but boring. Hell, I could hardly remember that they were supposed to be the main characters much of the time, figuring they were just extras who wandered too close to the camera. Seriously, Petersen and Pankow have no screen presence whatsoever. Perhaps the movie might even work if they had had better leads. The bad guys are far more interesting. Willem Dafoe is the main bad guy, a murderous and crazy counterfeiter. He might as well be the hero of the picture, since pretty much only when he was on screen could I be bothered to pay attention. John Turturro and Dean Stockwell also appear as Dafoe's associates. They don't have a lot to do, but at least they have some screen presence.",To Live and Die in L.A.
20,mm-39,Strong film,8,19 December 2000,"This story is very 80's, and is heavily influenced by the TV show Miami Vice.  The style, clothes, music, and characters reflect that time period exactly.  The direction of this film gives a slick feel; where its action, style, and seedy underside all blend in well.   The story could be very predictable, but with its plots twists, and the theme that follows the saying be careful when you go hunting for monster not to become one yourself gives it originality.  It has some mind blowing stunts that create tension, and if you watch the film Ronin you see where they got the car chase idea from. In all this film gives a feeling of being involved in events that go too fast, too dangerous, and too twisted.  Its shows what happens to the heart when the individual becomes obsessed with what he seeks.  Watch this one and love it.",To Live and Die in L.A.
21,Mr-Fusion,Sinful law and order,10,8 August 2013,"""To Live and Die in L.A."" is a familiar cat-and-mouse story packaged as a high-strung action movie. And under a lesser director, it'd probably just be a passable '80s flick. But William Friedkin's L.A. is an utterly counterfeit world, running the gamut from working class train yards to Santa Monica wealth. Everyone's playing everyone else, moral centers are unheard of, and you never know who has your back and who's getting ready to stab it. Hell, even the hero cop operates like the rules don't apply. That sense of tempting fate goes a long way to making a great movie despite it feeling so very 1985 (which, don't get me wrong, I love). And that's not even acknowledging the score (Wang Chung, who knew?) and a car chase that effectively tops Gene Hackman's driving in ""The French Connection"". This is essential homework for anyone who's ever played Grand Theft Auto, but it's unfair to just compare it to a video game. This is a classic cop movie, sleazy to its core and boasting a killer '80s vibe throughout. Amazing movie.10/10",To Live and Die in L.A.
22,christopher-underwood,great sense of excitement is established in the first half hour,7,14 May 2018,"This begins so well. Even the titles are eye-catching in that day-glow red and green. Actions is immediately confusing but dazzling with wonderful photography. A great sense of excitement is established in the first half hour but it is slightly concerning that with so many interested parties and police it is never absolutely clear what is going on. Then all becomes clear but the stunning visuals disappear and the action becomes almost laughable. It is then that I began to notice the inconsistent acting, due presumably to an element of improvisation encouraged by Friedkin. Matters are satisfactorily resolved in the end but that feeling of disengagement was never made good and it would discourage me from a second viewing despite all that fantastic early footage.",To Live and Die in L.A.
23,=G=,Dead and buried in Hollywood,6,2 March 2004,"""To Live and Die in L.A."" tells of a T-Man who will stop at nothing  to settle a score with a counterfeiter (Dafoe) who murdered his partner. A moody and very Hollywoodish action/drama, this film does little to distinguish itself, save one very good car chase, and plays out like just another cop vs bad guy movie. Petersen is too generic and vanilla and acts like a hyperactive Secret Service agent on meth. Funny money freak Dafoe is too stereotypical and acts like he's trying to be the personification of evil on ludes. The story is flawed with plot holes aplenty and obvious histrionics and the principal protag Petersen is too bad to be good, leaving the audience with no one to root for. Nonetheless, this flick received excellent reviews from critics with Ebert giving it a top four stars. Personally I couldn't remember anything about the film after 20 years, though I have vivid recollections of Friedkin's earlier ""French Connection"". ""Live & Die..."" is fodder for TV action junkies but too old to be state-of-the-art and not good enough to be a classic. Watchable but passable. (B-)",To Live and Die in L.A.

In an effort to get Masters to pay for what he did Heart's partner government agent and good friend Richard Chance, William Petersen, in determined to bring Masters to justice even if he ends up breaking the law, that he's sworn to enforce, to do it; even at the cost of fellow government Agents and innocent bystanders lives!Very probably the epitome of the bad cops or government agents movie genre of the 1970's & 80's ""To Live & Die in L.A"" has the utterly crazed and manic Agent Chanche act so out of character as a member of law enforcement that he makes Clint Eastwood's ""Dirty Harry"" Calahan look like the kind and lovable Officer Joe Bolton of 1950's TV ""Little Rascals"" fame. What surprised me more then anything about Agent Chance is just how he keeps getting away with what he does all throughout the movie with his superiors seeming to look the other way! It's as if they were giving him just enough rope in order to hang himself without having to do their jobs in discipline him on their own!Given a new partner Agent John Vukovich,John Pankow, to work with Chance waste no time at all in trying to corrupt the straight laced lawman in getting him involved in his obsession in getting Masters. Masters for his part despite all the evidence that both Chance & Vukovich are undercover government agents trying to get the goods him goes along with their sham as crooked businessmen needing ready cash, one million dollars in funny money, to keep their shady business ventures, probably drug and gun trafficking, afloat.***SPOILERS**** Totally taken in by the two G Men Masters later gets all that's coming to him in the end but the real criminal in all this Agent Chance, who makes Masters look like an alter boy, isn't around to see it. As for Chance's partner Agent Vukovich who's by then up on charges, that include the kidnapping and murder of a fellow government agent, he finally saw the light and stepped into Chance's shoes as the movie finally ended.Thre's lots of graphic violence as well as double and triple crossing, but surprisingly very little sex, that gives the film to zip that it needs to keep the audience interested. But it's the incredible ""French Connection"" like chase scene on the L.A freeway that makes it more then worth watching. What was so amazing about it is that with hundreds of cars and trucks damaged and smashed to pieces not only did both Agent's Chance & Vulcovich, who instigated the violence, walk away almost totally unscathed but the perusing L.A Police and US Governemts Agents had absolutely no idea, even though with all the evidence they should have had, that they were involved in it!",To Live and Die in L.A.
26,lost-in-limbo,Living on the edge.,10,20 July 2006,"In Los Angeles, we follow the turmoil and obsession that swallows secret service agent Richard Chance, when his long-time partner and good buddy, Michael Greene, is killed by counterfeiter Eric 'Rick' Masters. Now it's personal and the hotheaded, Chance is doing anything possible to nail down Masters. In doing so, Chance is putting his and new partner's, John Pankow, career on the line, by stretching the law to suit his own agenda.Now this incredible flick doesn't hold back on its searing material and it lays it down thick and fast! William Friedkin's ""To Live and Die in L.A."" is a sophisticatedly, hard-boiled crime thriller (adapted from the novel of Gerald Petievich, a former Secret Service agent) that has a plethora of unexpected turns and a very trance like appeal within its powerful makeup. For me, I don't care what anybody thinks, but this is one my favourite flicks and IMO, wait wait Friedkin's best. It might start off like a generic crime flick, but the symbolic themes running throughout the feature smacks you hard and are very important to the story's success in building an authentically grimy and hysterical edge amongst the highly flashy direction. There's such a strong realistic tone belted out, because of the way director Friedkin captures the explosively gritty, terribly relentless and deceitful cloud that puts you right into this hazy situation, on who's really batting for the good side. Where the fine line between cop and criminal merges into one in this artificial (counterfeit) world.There are a lot of fine theatrical touches and the main striking one, really goes for the extraordinary, hurtling car chase that's purely dynamite and excitingly executed because of its risky set-up. Precise handling and considerable skill makes this outing visually appealing and plenty staples of beautiful photography shots gives it an hypnotic pull and a sweeping motion that carries you along for one really pressure filled ride. Definitely screaming at you is a very 80s feel, thanks largely to Wang Chong's energy packed score that always on the move with it's biting flair. Sure, people are going to complain about it, but I didn't mind it, actually.The film's intense levels and sincerity is raised above the bar, because of picture-perfect acting from a well-ensemble cast. William Dafoe kicks in with an impressive performance as the sly weasel, Eric 'Rick' Masters. Making their big debuts are, William Peterson and John Pankow. Peterson puts the boot in to give an excellently raw and hard-edge performance as secret service agent Richard Chance and Pankow equally so, as the very alert new partner John Vukovich. Brilliant support roles in the shape of John Turturro as the slimy Carl Cody, one of Master's runners. Dean Stockwell plays the sneaky lawyer Bob Grimes, Darlanne Fluegel as the naturally stunning parolee Bianca Torres being used by Chance and Debra Feuer is manipulative, piercing as Master's flame, Ruth Lanier.What's makes this pounding flick inventively, wicked and far from contrived, is the way the film's material goes about its character's relationships with devious twists and deceptions making way for a great showstopper of an ending.A well-crafted and quite established crime thriller with explosive bursts interwoven into its glitzy, but also roughly cold embrace.",To Live and Die in L.A.
27,tabuno,A Solid Crime Drama Script That Gets Deflated,6,17 January 2019,"28 July 2012. This movie is a good example where an excellent and powerful crime story gets lost in directing, editing, and special action shots. Unlike Bullitt (1968), there are over the top car chases that don't really conform to the consistent human drama that is attempting to be portrayed on the screen. There are editing issues which make the movie difficult to understand and jumps in logical connections. What could have been a classic hard-hitting, moral, humanizing crime drama becomes more a of series of collective scenes that are sewn together. The secret service agents don't seem to be very good at their job and are offered scripts that seem to make them into one-dimensional television caricatures at times. William Petersen, the lead actor, one year later will have an amazing performance in Manhunter (1985) that is so polished and tightly directed that the contrast is a role model of what this movie might have been able to accomplish if not more.",To Live and Die in L.A.

Friedkin tries to recapture the magic of ""The French Connection"" by staging another spectacular car chase. While the car chase is exciting, it is not enough to save this film, which is all style and no substance. The plot is contrived and clichéd, the dialog is amateurish, and the cheesy score by Wang Chung is right in line with the MTV-like look of this film, which is not a good thing. The day and time is sporadically displayed on the screen for no apparent reason except a lame attempt to lend an urgency to the plot.

John Turturro, Dean Stockwell, and Willem Dafoe deliver solid performances. Unfortunately, the main character, William Peterson, pales by comparison. His portrayal as a Federal Agent is not convincing.

32,jzappa,A Somewhat Overdone but Often Irresistible Actioner from One of Hollywood's Most Fascinating Craftsmen,8,5 May 2011,"Aggressive, unsettling and cruel, To Live and Die in L.A. shoves the thriller genus past noir into a cynical ballet of vice, revenge and fatality. Friedkin forces us to the rim of a place where dark is glow, cop is crook and abnormality is, well, normal. He has imagined a society not in anarchy but flourishing owing to anarchy. Paradoxically, the two main characters, Chance the agent and Masters the counterfeiter, epitomize their names. Friedkin lets their exploits tell us precisely who they are. For Chance, the sole essential act is challenging mortality. He jumps off a bridge. It's the danger, the definitive chance. During the car chase, Friedkin cuts from Chance back to his bridge dive. His ecstasy then equals that of evading his chasers now. His reaction to enduring both is a cackling blast of delight and enthusiasm at hovering on the threshold. Chance's first partner, Hart cautions him that he's ""pushing too hard."" Chance dismisses it.In Masters, Friedkin taps an artiste. The pictures he paints have a revolting but lingering characteristic. The twenty-dollar bills he embosses are prepared with the same arduous meticulousness. An acknowledgment to his slyness and skill is that he's never been caught, and his reproductions are deemed unsurpassed. However Friedkin brings the idea of forgery outside Masters' lair. When Chance jumps, it seems like suicide till we clearly see the lifeline straggling out from his leg. When Masters joins his performer girlfriend Bianca in the ultramodern theater dressing room, it seems it's a man he's kissing fervently until Friedkin changes angles. She removes a wig, exposing plentiful red locks. Chance and his new partner, Vukovich, impersonate crooked bankers to capture Masters in a candid purchase of his reproductions. We watch Masters and Bianca shag and then Friedkin shows Masters and Bianca watching a video of themselves shagging. Friedkin's images imply that neither love nor money are authentic.And what may be the strangest instances of nothing being what it seems instigates the car chase. Chance and Vukovich need backing to run their scam on Masters that their department won't allot. Chance's seeming girlfriend, indeed his mole, tells him about a bagman for crooked diamond dealers who she knows is coming into town hauling $50,000. Chance induces an unwilling Vukovich to help him ""take this guy down"" who's ""breaking the law anyway."" The bagman, played by Michael Chong, is found to be an undercover fed, inadvertently shot by one of his own agents. A dozen cars struggle to chase down Chance and Vukovich as they veer and zigzag through river basins, loading docks, and the wrong way on the expressway. They don't know who was pursuing them until the next day in a briefing. The FBI's statement of the incident says the undercover agent's hijackers killed him. Really, Secret Service stole from FBI, who then chased Secret Service. Both sides think they're fighting bad guys.Friedkin lets eccentricity bleed into the consistency of his imagery, too. Corrosion was the NYC of French Connection. In Cruising, it had an inhospitable monochrome. In this very '80s action thriller, Friedkin sees LA as traumatized, disjointed. Friedkin cuts harshly from Masters' sprawling white art deco house to the ugly mechanized harbor of steel girders, cranes, tanks. There are Masters' paintings and Hart rendered a gory paste by a point-blank shotgun blast. Ruth's bungalow seems provided by Goodwill, while lawyer's offices are plush woods and coatings. Masters driving a menacing black Ferrari, Chance revs a Dodge Ram. To Friedkin, an auto necropolis is as charming and evocative an image of L.A. chic as white-bricked courthouse malls with lines of palm trees equably spaced.Friedkin takes the sinister gangland that has so enthralled him and opened it up to the elements---blistering and vivid---with this film. For instance, the Pasadena office of a lawyer who passes Masters' bad currency, is a mixture of green and red. Allowing the color scheme into the film, Friedkin uses it as counterpoint. What seems like blood dribbles down onto a silver printing plate in Masters' lab, but we swiftly recognize it's just red ink.Unluckily, the film begins with the foreword showing Chance and Hart as part of Reagan's bodyguard lineup. That night on the hotel roof, Chance finds a dead cop and an Islamic suicide bomber. Chance wants to talk him down and then sees Hart intervene before the extremist sets it off. The ensuing explosion is oddly muffled, bearing in mind the copious sticks of dynamite concerned. Also peculiar, the hotel is unperturbed, and Hart is unhurt considering the explosion was immediate and he was, it seems, next to the falling bomber. It's an untoward preface because it seems Friedkin's on his guard. In numerous of his previous films he pulls us into the story with a shocker of an opening, the assassination in French Connection, the demon in The Exorcist, or the mutilated arm in Cruising.But this was not Friedkin's single apparent woolgathering of nuance. It's valid that thrillers are implausible on occasion, which may be intrinsic in their allure, but in these instances, Friedkin stretches suspension of disbelief's practicalities a little thin. Though these moments preclude this movie from being near the same level with Friedkin's 1970s work, this West Coast overtooling of his gritty blueprint is still a visceral film of aberrations and obsessions: a Friedkin film.",To Live and Die in L.A.

34,dee.reid,Whoever would have thought that Living And Dying In L.A. could be so thrilling?,9,28 December 2020,"William Friedkin's 1985 action-thriller ""To Live in Die in L.A."" ranks as one of the director's finest cinematic achievements. Friedkin has directed some of the most thrilling action films of the last five decades - ""The French Connection"" (1971), ""Sorcerer"" (1977), ""Cruising"" (1980), ""The Hunted"" (2003) and of course his supernatural-horror masterpiece, ""The Exorcist"" (1973) - many of which are highlighted by some sort of ""chase"" element that has, over time, become the director's trademark.What has made Friedkin's films so exceptional, as far as action-thrillers go, is their stark realism and thorough (some would say, obsessive) knowledge of their subject matter. His films also earn their designation as ""thrillers,"" as his films are exciting and thrilling in ways that these sorts of films just aren't anymore; I know I was on the edge of my seat more than twice watching this film. This is no less truer than with ""To Live and Die in L.A.,"" an action-crime caper about a master counterfeiter and the extreme lengths a pair of dogged United States Secret Service agents will go to stop him.The counterfeiter in question is Rick Masters (Willem Dafoe, in another top-form villain performance), a sleazy, wealthy professional artist who has eluded the authorities for years and who flaunts his success. Richard Chance (William L. Petersen, of later ""Manhunter"" and ""CSI"" fame) and John Vukovich (John Pankow) are the pair of determined Los Angeles-based Secret Service agents hot on his trail. The plot gets moving when Masters brutally murders Chance's retiring partner during a botched stakeout, and, consumed with vengeance, vows to capture Masters by any means necessary - and brings the inexperienced Vukovich, his reluctant new partner, along with him, which leads to a number of encounters with shady characters high & low, and a thrilling car chase down the L.A. freeway (and such deftly choreographed chases are indicative of Friedkin's best and most exciting work).As stated earlier, the key to the success of ""To Live and Die in L.A."" is its realism and attention to the technical demands of the subject matter. The film is primarily about the inner-workings of both the U.S. Secret Service and the criminal underworld of counterfeiting. To help make the film even more authentic, Friedkin consulted Gerald Petievich, who wrote the novel that the film is based on and who also co-wrote the script with Friedkin, a former Secret Service agent himself and the film is presumably based (at least partially) on his experiences; real-life counterfeiters were also brought on to the production to help with the film's much-talked-about counterfeiting sequences where real (albeit deliberately erroneous and unusable) counterfeit dollar bills were printed and co-star Willem Dafoe reportedly learned how to make real money. (Also as could be expected, some of those bills made it into circulation, anyway, and subsequent investigations traced them back to the film.)The performers are all top-notch. Former Chicago stage veteran William L. Petersen carries the film as the reckless and irresponsible, ethically compromised Richard Chance, who is not above bending (if not outright breaking) the law in his pursuit of Rick Masters. It's a dogged intensity that threatens to consume him and obviously rubs his uncertain, less-experienced partner Vukovich the wrong way as the two are dragged deeper and deeper down a legal quagmire from which there may be no easy way out of. And Willem Dafoe, best known for his long list of villainous characters, turns in yet another winning performance as a truly crafty, vile, and murderous antagonist.As some have noted, there is an air of intentional cynicism that covers much of ""To Live and Die in L.A."" that some have seen may prevent some viewers from truly identifying with any of the characters. This is certainly true for its gritty portrayal of federal agents who are not above breaking the law and endangering the lives of innocent civilians to achieve results in bringing dangerous criminals to justice. Incredibly enough, ""Dirty Harry"" (1971) was one of the earliest action films to really address this sort of thing. I myself noted the law-bending/-breaking tactics used by the main characters in trying to track down Rick Masters, and saw that they were soon becoming the very things that they were trying to catch, and got them deeper and deeper into a legal predicament that would do little to further their cause. In other words, another brilliant aspect of the film's realism is that the pursuit of justice for Chance and Vukovich - and their ""by any means necessary"" approach - is not without serious consequences for either of them in the end.This stark realism and, dare I say, amorality, shows that this is no ordinary cops & robbers show.""To Live and Die in L.A."" is a great, classic action picture from William Friedkin. Its action sequences and technical skill help to elevate it above the plethora of similar-minded but less skilled action features that dominated the '80s action scene.9/10P.S.: The soundtrack by London-based rock duo Wang Chung is simply phenomenal. I'm listening to it right now as I write this review, and have ""City Of The Angels"" (featured during the opening credits and also during Rick Masters's counterfeiting montage) on repeat.",To Live and Die in L.A.

Shortly before his retirement, the team partner gets killed by a vicious criminal. The cop takes this very badly and loses his way, growing ever more obsessed with bringing down the criminal. Meanwhile he gets a new partner, a rookie...Take this premise and insert it into a classical buddy movie : as a viewer you'll be able to predict the general story. (To wit : after a series of conflicts and mishaps the new team learns to get along. The cop who lost his partner regains his mental equilibrium, while the rookie learns valuable lessons about enterprise and courage. In the end, both partners best the criminal and bring him to justice.) However, ""To Live and Die"" is far from a classical buddy movie : it gathers a number of tropes, twists them like pretzel dough, bakes them and then walks all over them, on Dutch clogs. As a result the plot moves into an unpredictable direction or rather, a wild variety of unpredictable directions.(The protagonists are secret agents rather than cops, but I've used ""cop"" as a shorthand.)""To Live and Die"" is also a seriously violent movie, with a mean streak a mile long. The characters are either morally evil or morally ambiguous and most, if not all of them, believe in the twin arts of revenge and betrayal : one double-cross or one triple-cross invites another. As a result the viewer is well-advised to pay close attention to what happens on the screen.The urban background has been chosen and filmed with a great deal of artistic imagination. The result is an immersion in a busy, teeming, many-faceted city which combines extremes of decadent wealth with extremes of blasted poverty.Finally it should be noted that ""To Live and Die"" contains the Tyrannosaurus Rex of car chases.",To Live and Die in L.A.

Not that it's a bad film per se, but it also isn't as great as some are making it out to be. The plot is pretty standard fare: Secret Service Agent William Petersen's partner is blown away by scumbag counterfeiter Willem Dafoe; Petersen vows revenge with the aid of '80s character actor John Pankow (""Talk Radio,"" ""Monkey Shines""). Dean Stockwell shows up for a few scenes as a mob lawyer, and a young John Turturro plays Dafoe's fall guy. The cast is quite excellent and invests a fair amount of intensity in their respective roles; Pankow, especially, brings much life to the clichéd ""straight-arrow partner."" Yet while director William Friedkin, clearly looking for a worthy follow-up to ""The French Connection,"" stages some extraordinary foot-chases, car chases, and action scenes, the story in between is handled poorly--the dialog scenes are slow, confusing, and unimaginatively shot by comparison. The story itself is also too convoluted to be enjoyed. William Petersen (""Manhunter,"" ""CSI"") is a particularly unsympathetic protagonist, a corrupt cop who's ultimately as bad as the scum he's blowing away; Gene Hackman's portrayal of Popeye Doyle in ""Connection"" struck a balance in the hero/antihero dynamic, and was far more endearing. That being said, this is a thrilling film, and the last half hour became so alive with tension that it almost redeemed the entire project. If you have a stomach for violence, ""To Live and Die in L.A."" isn't bad--just put your brain on the shelf for maximum enjoyment.5.5 out of 10",To Live and Die in L.A.
38,ShootingShark,Ultra-Stylish Super-Eighties Crime Thriller With Tremendous Cast And Direction,7,21 August 2005,"Richard Chance, a gung-ho risk-taking secret-service agent, is out to avenge the death of his partner at the hands of an expert counterfeiter, but his reckless actions lead him into a chaotic and ultimately self-destructive spiral, with tragic consequences.This eye-popping cop thriller, from a novel by Gerald Petievich, is somehow both gritty and glamorous, arty and trashy, enjoyable and deplorable. It's extremely rare in an American thriller to have an antihero who is so resolutely obsessive and distasteful, and who pays the ultimate price for it in the end. Petersen is blisteringly unforgettable in the role, despite having no prior movie experience; all body-popping fireworks and crackling on-screen energy. The rest of the cast are all brilliant as an eclectic series of lowlifes, especially Dafoe as the thoroughly deranged funny-moneymaker. What really pumps this movie into a higher gear though is the supercool direction by Friedkin - his camera zooms all over the place, never pausing for breath, rushing through the action, lovingly painting its canvas of eighties Los Angeles as a cradle of sin. The orange-and-brown photography by Robby Muller, superloud snare-drum music of art-rock band Wang Chung and razor-fast editing by Bud Smith are all first-rate. There is an incredible chase sequence (supervised by Buddy Joe Hooker) when Chance drives the wrong way down a freeway, which is one of the most impressive ever committed to film. The clever twist at the end puts the icing on a brilliantly conceived, top-notch crime thriller. This is a film which puts a detestable sociopath in the hero role and subverts all the standard genre clichés. Never trust a copper.",To Live and Die in L.A.
39,Samiam3,Enjoyable cop thriller,7,29 October 2010,"With To Live and Die in L.A. William Friedkin is able to capture the spirit of his crime masterwork the French Connection, but there's a bit more brawns than brains with this one. That won't be a problem for some, but I found it to be a slight handicap.Both this and The French Connection are great cop thrillers, this one is slightly inferior for two obvious reason. Firstly the overall performance quality is mediocre, and secondly, the movie's finale lacks a climactic sense of bang, and a narrative closure. To Live and die is L.A. opens the doors for a sequel, which seems quite unnecessary The movie begins with one person's point of view and concludes from a different person's (who judging by the actor's performance may not make such a good lead had there been a sequel)I would say otherwise the film is competent. What I like best about it is how it is able to work around a genre cliché (cop seeks revenge for dead partner) and provide a scenario that is more involving and fiery than it is tiring and generic. The action portion of the film (despite a muddled and striped down sound mix) is authentic, due to an emphasis on brutality, which is reflected better than anything in an extensive car through a net work of back alleys, across a reservoir, and down a free way, in the wrong direction. You don't see movies quite like To Live and Die in L.A. made today. Everything has to be visually specular and story-wise simple. This motion picture, while not necessarily smart, is smart enough, and certainly down to earth making it recommendable for intelligent viewers in search of a cop thriller, or as a recommendation to those who want more French Connection-ism",To Live and Die in L.A.

42,Easygoer10,Brilliant,9,11 December 2018,"This is 1 of my favorite William Friedkin & Willem Dafoe films. Dafoe absolutely owns you with his screen presence. Friedkin did a superb job casting & directing it. The plot is terrific, with many very good action scenes, IE: the car chase. It is (imo) surpassed by those from only 2 films: ""Bullitt (1968) & ""Ronin"" (1995). Having William Peterson as the protagonist set against Dafoe as the antagonist is formidable. Debra Feuer is so good, cast as Dafoe's girlfriend. She has not made many films; carefully selecting roles. The soundtrack is perfectly suited; all of it done by the band Wang Chung; just for this film. It has many twists and turns; a true thriller. I dont know why so many critics panned it, but they were dead wrong. Next to ""The Exorcist"" (1973) & ""The French Connection"" (1971), which won a multitude of Academy Awards, it is my 3rd favorite film by 1 of America's top directors. Friedkin has made many excellent films. ""The Exorcist"" migjt have dominated the Academy Awards (although it did win several) if not for being released the same year as ""The Godfather"". It is still the most terrifying film I have ever seen; only ""Alien"" (1979) & ""The Shining"" (1980) are in that territory (I am the ultimate Stanley Kubrick fan!).",To Live and Die in L.A.

There is a heated debate on the film's IMDb message board about this. I found myself warming to the score as the film progressed. But I guess there were better cheesy 80's songs that you could have used. Some of the songs were simply awful.It is a film of place - as the name suggests. There are some beautiful long shots but some of the action takes place in really ugly warehouses and wastelands. It is not a very pretty film to watch on a normal DVD.It has great action scenes - while nowhere as good as the ones in The Sorcerer and The French Connection, the car chase in To Live and Die in LA was quite thrilling.It is peppered with eccentric characters - especially the two protagonists who share a woman and nothing is certain about their sexuality.It has some great performances - by William Petersen, John Turturro and Willem Dafoe.Despite all this, it is not in the same league as some of your 70s films.

46,seymourblack-1,Breaking The Rules,8,11 January 2013,"This glossy action thriller about revenge, counterfeit money and two adversaries whose behaviours make them hostages to fortune, contains various chases, stunts and shoot-outs which are delivered with such pace and panache that the excitement never lets up for long. Thanks to some excellent location shots, Robby Muller's beautifully photographed vistas and the score by Wang Chung, ""To Live And Die In L.A."" also has a tremendously strong sense of time and place.Richard Chance (William L Petersen) and Jimmy Hart (Michael Greene) are U.S. Secret Service agents who are involved in an investigation into a counterfeiting operation and after Hart is murdered whilst following a lead on his own, Chance swears to hunt down his partner's killer. Rick Masters (Willem Dafoe). Masters is a ruthless ex-con who's such a skilled operator that he's been able to continue his criminal activities for many years without being brought to justice.Chance and his new partner John Vukovich (John Pankow) pose as a couple of bankers from Palm Springs in an undercover operation to purchase counterfeit money from Masters. When the ""front money"" that Masters demands is much greater than the funds that their office can make available to them, Chance persuades Vukovich to help him steal $50,000 from a criminal courier that he's been tipped off about.After kidnapping and robbing the courier, things go dreadfully wrong as it transpires that their victim is actually an undercover FBI agent and his back-up team then pursue Chance and Vukovich in a frantic chase through the streets and freeways of L.A. After making their getaway, the two agents also find that things go wrong when they eventually meet up with Masters to exchange their stolen money for $1.000,000 of counterfeit bills.William L Petersen gives a solid performance as the amoral Chance who's a reckless risk-taker and someone who has no qualms about operating outside the law in order to get Masters. He also shows little concern about the fate of the FBI agent and considers it perfectly acceptable to use blackmail as a means to get a regular supply of tip-offs and other benefits from Ruth Lanier (Darlanne Fluegal) who's a parolee who knows that Chance has the power to have her parole revoked at any time.John Vukovich is a far more conventional agent than Chance and is very reluctant to be involved in stealing money from the courier. John Pankow does a great job of conveying how anxious his character is and also how uncomfortable he is doing the kind of work that Chance thrives on. The most impressive performance, however, comes from Willem Dafoe who consistently dominates the scenes that he's in as the villain of the piece. Masters is intelligent and talented as an artist but also a vicious psychopath who enjoys using fire to dispose of his work.Two sequences in this movie really stand out. The exciting car chase on the crowded L.A. freeway is brilliantly choreographed and the montage which shows Masters' skill in producing counterfeit money is fascinating and looks very realistic.""To Live And Die In L.A."" is a visceral and violent movie which contains one major surprise and an ending that's particularly chilling as Vukovich shows how deeply he's been corrupted.",To Live and Die in L.A.
47,mossgrymk,to live and die in LA,9,1 August 2021,"This mid 80s neo noir is a pretty good subversion of the genre which is, when you come to think about it, exactly what a neo type film should be. William Petersen, who is usually on the bland side (thus the truncated career), is quite good as arguably the most sociopathic character in the film, a Secret Service Agent who uses his designation as a Good Guy to continually cross the line into Bad Guy territory where he literally wallows in its warm, amoral mud. And when was the last time you've seen a T Man as anything but a paragon of law and order righteousness? Try never. So, obviously, we have left the land of Dennis O'Keefe and even Clint in ""Line Of Fire"" far, far behind us and congrats to director William Friedkin for fully embracing this perversity and providing us with a shocking, but well earned, climax involving Petersen's depraved fed. To mention nothing of a car chase that seems to take off where ""Bullitt"" stops. Also congrats to cinematographer Robby Muller for pulling against the tired ethos of my hometown as soulless and ugly with shots that bring out its tawdry beauty (thinking about that twilight over the Vincent Thomas Bridge shot with the sky a pink purple and the oil drums lit up like white Christmas lights). And kudos as well to Willem Defoe for a properly creepy, skin prickling adversary. So, even though the dialogue (by Friedkin and the novelist upon whose work the film is based) tends toward the flat and one dimensional and, as evidence of this rather clunky writing, John Pankow's character change comes out of not only left but center and right fields, as well, and the music majorly sucks, this is a film that I think I'll be wanting to see again.

48,Terrell-4,"Even with the toe kneading, we have a movie that is exciting, irritating, nasty around the edges and a pleasure to watch",8,16 July 2008,"To Live and Die in L. A., in my opinion, is a first-class movie, just as a scoop of jamocha almond fudge is a great cone. But it's unnerving when after three or four satisfying licks of jamocha all of a sudden you're handling the taste of tutti-frutti. What the...but then you're back quickly to the jamocha...wait a minute, now I've got a taste of raspberry-pumpkin to deal with. William Friedkin's movie about a murderous counterfeiter and an obsessed, out-of-control Secret Service agent who is determined to kill or capture him has many pleasures. Among them is Willem Dafoe as Rick Masters, a first-rate counterfeiter, a second-rate artist, a clever man with a big, cunning ego and a dangerous lack of humanitarian standards. Masters is a killer, and Dafoe, with his bony face, full lips and watchful eyes -- and outstanding acting talent -- makes the most of the part. There's a terrific, white-knuckle car chase through a truck-crowded produce market and then the wrong way on a crowded freeway. And Friedkin makes the most of the story, from telling us all we would ever want to know about how to counterfeit $20 bills, and doing so in fascinating detail, to building a gallery of sleazy criminals, used women and all-too-flawed cops. The drive to bring down Rick Masters is built up of set piece after set piece, each a building block which is put in place with a great deal of assurance. I enjoyed myself no end. But in a disconcerting way, while I could see the superb talents of the director who gave us The French Connection (a great film), The Night They Raided Minsky's (a bit of burlesque nostalgia put together with skill) and The Exorcist (a huge crowd pleaser), there also were enough ""why did he include this?"" moments that brought to mind the whole string of movies he's made that just didn't work well. Friedkin throws in everything from a toe-kneading lesbian subtext, unnecessary full frontal (for a second or two) male nudity, an easily ironic ""whose the tough guy now"" closing and a climax reminiscent of the Frankenstein monster staggering around in flames. Friedkin even mars that nerve-wracking, over-the-top car chase, which is as technically exciting as The French Connection's chase, by throwing in the silly illogic of all those guys in black cars and with semi-automatics popping up along the route. Distracting? Yes. Intentional? I'm afraid so. Among the elements that made The French Connection so powerful and entertaining were two great actors, Gene Hackman and Fernando Rey. To Live and Die in L. A. has some fine actors, but none come close to the defining work of Hackman and Rey. Dafoe stands out of the crowd, but, in my opinion, that's it. As William Chance, the obsessed Secret Service agent, we have William Peterson, a baby-faced actor playing a baby-faced hotshot tough guy. He's saddled with such corny tough guy dialogue as, ""Let me tell you something, amigo. I'm going to bag Masters and I don't give a ---- how I do it!"" or (with a snarl) ""You mean you won't carry your weight if something goes down?"" While Masters becomes more ruthless as the story unfolds and, in a perverse way, becomes more dominant because of his sense of humor and weird charm, Chance simply becomes more self-involved, more predictable and more unlikable. However, there is a surprise 104 minutes into the movie that solves part of the problem. To Live and Die in L. A. has so many excellent elements that I ended up wishing Friedkin had employed more self-discipline in his choice of the elements he used to embroider the story. It would be sad indeed to see a director like William Friedkin tagged as the man who had two big hits, and then everything after for 35 years was either flawed, a failure or dull. To Live and Die in L. A. runs nearly two hours. If Friedkin had been forced to edit it down by, say 15 minutes, I think he might have had something approaching The French Connection's powerful tension. As it is, we have a movie that is exciting, irritating, nasty around the edges and a pleasure to watch.",To Live and Die in L.A.

Most of the professional critics trashed this film when it came out. Personally, I find this film sophisticated, exciting, and visually superior to most films of the genre.Most of criticism was due to the fact that ""all of the characters are evil and manipulative"" and what not. Well, such is life. The ""good guys"" are not always angelic. They have real emotions and can be driven by less than idealistic motives, same as the villains. Agent Chance isn't perfect, but masters is as bad as they come.This film is slickly made, and intelligently written. The cast is superb. The soundtrack is sure to make you long for the days of techno-pop in the mid 1980s. I never really heard much from Wang Chung except the music from this movie. It rocks!If it's been a while since you've seen this, by all means try to find it. The film is dated, but in a positive way.

50,Maziun,"Underrated brilliant movie – French Connection"" of the 80's",9,20 September 2014,"On the surface it's just an ordinary action crime thriller . However director William Friedkin (""French connection"") takes a cliché story and creates one of the most dark , realistic and surprising movies I have ever seen. This is ART. It was obviously way ahead of it's time in the 80's and sadly even today it doesn't gets the recognition it deserves. I guess it's too intelligent for some critics and viewers. It's much more complex than the surface description of the plot suggests.The screenplay is loosely based on Gerald Petievich (a former Secret Service agent) book under the same title. The line between good and evil is very thin in this movie. Every character makes mistakes . It's hard to identify with the characters , because nobody is completely good or evil. The characters are well written, three dimensional and you forget that this is only a movie. I loved it . The story is very thrilling and unpredictable. The film has a very amoral feel to it , it's like a journey to Hell.The two main characters are mirrors of each other because both are obsessive with what they want to do. Both are living on the edge . Both are antiheroes. One is a cop who is breaking law , while other is a criminal that works within the law. One isn't loyal to his friends , the other respects loyalty. The main theme of the movie is counterfeit – in the money , but also in the people too with the characters motivations , emotions and relationships. It's a realistic and bitter movie that breaks standard Hollywood clichés . There's no hope for justice, good will and redemption . Every character is selfish and even self destructive.The movie is quite unique and important part of the movie , giving it a definite 80s feel. 1980s band Wang Chung provided much of the soundtrack for this movie . Their sound perfectly melts with the cinematography. Great and unforgettable songs – "" To live and die in LA"" , ""Wait"" and ""Dance hall days "".The electronic score provides a thumping beat that matches the intensity and energy of the film's pace and style. Fantastic photography by Robby Muller. Los Angeles looks both beautiful and dirty . The movie has a very 80's feel to it (clothes , haircuts , Reagan etc) and wonderfully captures the feel of that decade , ""The decade of greed"". The action scenes are great , raw and brutal . Who could forget the AWESOME car chase or the shocking finale ?! Solid performances from all the people in the cast . There is no Oscar worthy performances here , but the overall quality of acting is high. William Petersen (""Manhunter"") , Willem Defoe (""Platoon"") , John Pankow ("" The secret of my success , Darlene Fluogel (""Running scared"") , John Tuturro (""Barton Fink"") Dean Stockwell (""Blue velvet"") and Steve James (""Delta force"") make one of the best acting teams I have ever seen.This is a proof that if you have a vision and talent you don't need big budget (it cost only 6 million dollars !) to make a great movie. I really recommend this movie. It's very ""anti-Miami vice"" and ""anti-Lethal weapon"" type of movie. Not everybody will appreciate the nihilistic mood of the movie. It's a movie for adults . I give it 9/10.",To Live and Die in L.A.
51,Son_of_Mansfield,To Whine and Moan in L.A.,6,6 April 2007,"William Peterson and Willem Dafoe play almost interchangeable characters in this one dimensional tale. Much has been made of the fact that the morally bankrupt characters are part of the story, the thought. It's true, but they are so flat that they don't even feel like characters. There isn't much more than bad acts to go on and a lot of tough talk. If that fits into your world view, you will love this movie. But even the cruelest individuals have their moments, their pathos, that allows a glimmer, no matter how fleeting, of humanity. If the same movie had been made with a lesser director and actors who not as capable, this wouldn't even be remembered, because the movie has as little character as people it displays.P.S. L.A.

52,RJBurke1942,"Mirror, mirror on the wall  who is the dirtiest of them all?",9,21 November 2007,"There are three things going for this crime thriller: it's a great  in the sense, believable and well-constructed  story; for the time, it has an ordinary  in the sense, not top box-office stars  cast that produce star quality performances; and, of course, it's directed by William Friedkin, a director well known for constructing cinema designed to shock.The narrative  which I understand only barely resembles the story line of the novel  is a piece of nasty work in the form of the moral ambiguity that constantly arises when 'good' guys exceed their authority to do whatever it takes to bag the 'bad' guys. Friedkin had already explored that in The French Connection (1971) but, at that time, he used a big star draw card with Gene Hackman, who, as Popeye Doyle, trod on a lot of toes and faces to do the job  and still managed to garner sympathy from this viewer, and many others, despite his excesses.That is not the case for Richard Chance (William Petersen), the T-man who'll do anything to get Rick Masters (Willem Dafoe) for murdering another T-man, Jim Hart (Michael Greene), Chance's partner in crime, so to speak. You see (literally and visually) the trouble with Chance, is that he always wants to take a chance on bridging the gap between doing what's right and proper, and doing what he wants to get the job done; ethically, he's a true pragmatist  totally vacuous when it comes to core principles. And that's in direct contrast to Rick Masters, who's loyal to all those around him, until they double-cross him; only then do those real 'bad' guys pay the price for their double trouble.From the narrative perspective, Chance and Masters are mirror images, of course, and each shares the same first name (although, for Masters, Rick is a nick-name), thus providing a duality of principle and purpose in the totally corrupt society as presented by Freidkin; and all of which is summed up with Bob Grimes' (an urbane and consummate Dean Stockwell) pithy rebuttal to Bianca (Debra Feuer) when she asked him why he was lawyer for Masters: ""It's just business"". Note the great grimy name for Stockwell's totally debased character...So, the great irony for this story is that Chance works within the law as a T-man, but operates as much as he can outside of it to further his personal interests; while Masters works outside of the law as an anti-T-man (he counterfeits money), while operating within it as much as he can  using corrupt lawyers and the legal system  to further his own interests. So, who is the real bad guy? Who deserves more sympathy from society? The ending is fitting, as it should be: out with the old, in with the new. Society continues to function, in all its grime and glory, such as it is; but it is also Friedkin's Disconnection on a grand scale for telling the truth about how it all works. Little wonder: most people can't handle the truth, as somebody said, because there's a little bit of Chance and Masters in all of us. And, we all know what happened to Friedkin's career as a director after this one was released.There are, however, few thrillers, in the last twenty-five years, better than this one for irony, suspense and action. Add to that the sexually pulsating sound track from Wang Chung and the on-site location shooting around Los Angeles  and you have a very believable story in a city where angels always fear to tread.Is it just co-incidental that many of the actors went on to greater recognition? For William Petersen, this was his second movie; for Willem Dafoe, it was his sixth; for John Pankow, his third; Turturro, his fifth and so on. Granted, they all have to start somewhere, but after this one, their status grew rapidly. We can all thank Friedkin for that.See it for sure, if you haven't already; see it again for what you missed first time round. Highly recommended for adults only.",To Live and Die in L.A.
53,PeterMitchell-506-564364,"A 100 percent stylish L.A throughout, a masterpiece of coolness",8,25 March 2013,"How I yearned to be such a cool cat as William L. Petersen's Richard Chance in To Live And Die In L.A. Like nearly everyone else in this movie, he is a baddie, but more so, a secret service agent on a personal mission of vengeance after his partner is taken out, by master counterfeiter, Rick Masters (Dafoe) who creates a memorable, slightly psychotic bad guy, who isn't afraid to kill anyone who gets to close to his operation. I was questioning myself at the time I first saw this flick back in 86, who is this cool actor, William L. Petersen, and what else has he been in, and will I ever see him in anything else, where at the time I discovered he had done F all. I hired the movie again in 87, and copied it, I loved it that much. This movie is so cool, as in the hip music accompaniment, that plays against some cool scenes. Other assets is the proud use of numerous L.A locations, and the cool opening establishing shot, against Wang Chung's Title score. Plus, we have that grand, almost ten minute car chase, that ends with one car going against a sea of oncoming traffic on an L.A freeway. Earlier in the chase, our hot shot agent baddies, were pursued by a number of other legitimate agents, after a snatch and grab plan, to rob this Asian, carrying a suitcase of diamonds, backfires. Petersen and Pankow were oblivious to the fact, he was an actual agent, where Petersen was told some bologne prior. To imagine this crazy freeway scene happening in reality, I don't think we'd come out as lucky as Petersen and Pankow, who provides a menacing twist at the end, after all has been said, and bullets have flown, Dafoe going up in a ball of flames. One thing I never saw coming, was Petersen's fate. He just got unlucky I guess. It was so cool watching Dafoe print his cash, in detail, up against a pumping music score, that plays in other parts of the movie. But you audience don't get any ideas. Even the violence has style, some of it heavy and brutal, plus a good assemblage of performances, some of them from up and coming actors. The end credit music shot against another Wang Chung hit, ends it beautifully. This is one of the coolest movies of the eighties, or more correctly, 86, a movie driven by style, and when you have so much other stuff going for it, you know you have a winner. A great night in front of the tube awaits. Just put the tape in and play. Robert Downey, (yes Robert Downey Jnr's dad) plays Petersen's and Pankow's boss.",To Live and Die in L.A.

So rather than reiterating massive plot details, I'll simply give my overall impressions. Also, not watching CSI, I wasn't familiar at all with William Peterson.This film has more mayhem than the ""Dirty Harry"" and ""French Connection"" films, combined. And Chance, the lead cop makes more wrong turns and experiences more consequences of his misguided actions and wrong decisions/judgment than Dabney Coleman in ""Short Time,"" or Clouseau in all his films. (And Dabney, as a cop near retirement, with mistaken/mixed-up medical test inaccurately saying he was dying, wanted to get whacked in the line of duty so his son could benefit from the major proceeds for his college fund; so his goofy actions were intentional.)As I noted in one comment here, there certainly are no sympathetic characters on either side of the law here (or in Dean Stockwell's lawyer, who pretty much straddles these). Willem Dafoe is the main ""bad guy,"" playing it with a sort of laconic menace, no stretch for him.Peterson's ""Chance's"" total obsession in pursuing Dafoe seems over-the-top to a large degree, and it costs others a great deal along the way, including - in the big car chase - probably more auto accidents on the freeway than even L. A. would normally encounter in several months.But I nonetheless found it engrossing, and viewed now gives a view of the 1980's movie techniques and music, which would be different today. And with the deaths and injuries occurring, at least the lack of sympathetic attributes on the part of the characters provides less disturbance than one might sustain normally.",To Live and Die in L.A.

You want bread, f*ck a baker."" - Richard Chance",7,29 September 2005,"The incredibly out-dated but still thrilling 'To Live and Die in L.A.' is something I'd recommend you seeing if you like realistic gritty crime dramas. It really doesn't get much grittier then this, this dark-spirited crime caper based on a true story follows U.S. Secret Service Agent/Badass Richard Chance (William Petersen) and his bloody and consistent pursuit to catch the counterfeiter (Willem Dafoe) who murdered his soon-to-be retired partner. The film is jam-packed with action, but it is just so out-dated. 'To Live and Die in L.A.' is like spending two hours in an 1980s nightmare, but hey, for the time is was pretty good. William Friedkin (The French Connection, The Exorcist) does a superb job directing this, but the screenplay drags a lot during the non-action sequences. William Petersen gives one of if not his finest performance as the macho agent on a mission, while Willem Dafoe plays the creepy role he usually plays (not to say he isn't great). I'd recommend you seeing this if you want some good action scenes and don't mind some rather brutal violence. It's a good film, but it has some serious faults, so don't be expecting something on par with Friedkin's masterful 'French Connection'. Grade: B",To Live and Die in L.A.

It's the 80's all over and I absolutely love it for it. I love how cutting edge it is that it has been source of many of the cliches of Buddy cop movies flowing well in to the 90's comedy cop revival.It's typical Bill Friedkin, it's part realism and finger on the pulse, and part enigmatic and esoteric digging in to men's souls. It's what he does best and this film takes a left turn from the usual money laundering cop chase thriller to something about fakery and regret, about empathy and probably a few other things.

He blew everyone away with The FrenchConnection and in To Live and Die in LA, he ups the ante.  Toescape a bunch of guys with guns, William Peterson floors it upan exit ramp and into oncoming traffic.  The rest of thesequence needs to be seen, but it is exciting.  The rest of themovie is a bit uneven.  Peterson is trying to nail Willem Dafoefor the murder of Peterson's partner.  And he's willing to doanything to get him.  We see how determined Peterson is and wesee how crafty Dafoe is.  Along the way there are some subplotsthat don't really have the chance to get fleshed out.  There'senergy in this film, but the energy seems to get diverted attimes and the film starts to drag a little.  Friedkin is a gooddirector who knows how to grab an audience and hold them untilthe very end.

The chase scene was fantastic, I can easily say it was much better than the one in ""The French Connection""(1971), and went on much longer.  The plot turns are often confusing, at least for me, but I still enjoyed the film, and thought it was a lot better than ""The French Connection"", which I hated, so that's not saying much.

59,Cinemaniac1984,An underrated gem.,9,31 July 2016,"To Live and Die in L.A. is one of those underrated gems that could easily get lost but then resurface every once in a while. Based on a novel by former Secret Service Agent Gerald Petievich, this action packed crime caper moves at a frenetic pace thanks to director William Friedkin (The French Connection) and it is also notable for featuring a cast of almost unknowns who later find stardom.Los Angeles Secret Service Agent Richard Chance (William L. Petersen, CSI: Crime Scene Investigation) is a reckless daredevil who vows to take down the brilliant but murderous counterfeiter Rick Masters (Willem Dafoe, Platoon) following the brutal murder of Chance's partner Jimmy Hart (Michael Greene) who was due to retire in less than three days. Chance makes it very clear to his new partner John Vukovich (John Pankow, Mad About You) that he will break the law and throw all the rules and ethics out the window to catch Masters no matter the cost. Chance also relies on his informant Ruth (Darlanne Fluegel, Lock Up) to provide him relevant tips with whom he is also having a sexual relationship with as well. Vukovich also contacts Master's lawyer Bob Grimes (Dean Stockwell, Blue Velvet) to try and get close to Masters. Chance and Vukovich continue to tear up the streets of Los Angeles hot on the heels of Masters, but for everyone the price may come at high cost.William L. Petersen, who made his big break here, turns in an excellent performance as the thrill seeking daredevil Secret Service Agent Richard Chance who is breaking every rule in the book no matter the cost to avenge the death of his partner. Willem Dafoe shows that he is always reliable no matter what role he plays and as the murderous counterfeiter Rick Masters, Dafoe is almost flawless. John Pankow who is later well known for comedic roles does a fine job as straight laced John Vukovich who finds himself in a moral dilemma taking down Masters with his partner Chance.The soundtrack by pop band Wang Chun gives the film a neo-noir feeling reminiscent to Miami Vice although the same mood is transferred to Los Angeles. Everything about To Live and Die in L.A. is unashamedly 80's.What makes To Live and Die in L.A. enjoyable is that the movie is not just the same clichéd crime caper. The good guys might have their strengths but their flaws prove to be their downfall. Richard Chance is definitely more of an anti-hero who sees things as the end justifies the means. The bad guys are also three dimensional. While they are criminals, they are also human without sympathizing with them or glamorising their lifestyle. Rick Masters might be brilliant with his methodical attention to detail with counterfeiting dollar bills, but he is also ruthless and is not afraid to commit murder should anyone cross him. His personal life also shows his eccentric behaviour.To Live and Die in L.A. is also made even more memorable featuring one of the most thrilling car chases in cinematic history.Keep an eye out for John Turturro (The Big Lebowski), Robert Downey Sr. (Robert Downey Jr's father) and Steve James (American Ninja) in small roles.Over 30 years later, To Live and Die in L.A. is still an underrated gem that is still enjoyable and well worth checking out. It's also fantastic to see a majority of the cast including William L. Petersen and Willem Dafoe move onto bigger and better things with their career.9/10.",To Live and Die in L.A.
60,hokeybutt,Best Dang Car Chase Sequence Ever!,8,29 July 2004,"TO LIVE AND DIE IN LA (4 outta 5 stars)It's been a long time since I had seen this movie... when I first saw it the actors were all basically unknown to me... now they are all fairly well-known (William L Peterson, Willem Dafoe, John Pankow)... but, wow, this is was a great movie then and it's a great movie now. A great follow-up/companion film to director William Friedkin's ""The French Connection""... but taking place on the other side of the US. Terrific story about the US Secret Service and the counterfeiting racket... don't want to give away too many details because the best part of the movie is its unpredictability. Suffice to say that the movie has one of the greatest, jaw-droppingly exciting chase scenes ever filmed... I'd say it even tops the one in ""French Connection""! The movie has a large cast of characters... all of them memorable and believable and all integrated well into the basic storyline. Some of the '80s music sounds a little cheesy (Wang Chung did the soundtrack) but some of it actually works pretty well. Don't miss this one!",To Live and Die in L.A.
61,avik-basu1889,Morality story set in L.A.,4,21 October 2014,"It's always been hit or miss for me with William Freidkin. I love The Exorcist and The French Connection. I also like Cruising which most people don't. But there a lot of his films that I am not at all fond of. Unfortunately ""To Live and Die in L.A."" falls in the latter category. Let's get the positives out of the way first. The cinematography is good. The opening credit sequence with the damaged cars and the seedy roadside low-lives perfectly sets the mood by throwing light on the dark side of the city. There are a number of interesting themes that are explored here like how far an individual can go to do the thing he thinks is right, can the supposedly moral always uphold his morality, questionable actions can reverse the tale and the hunter can become the hunted, how individuals are influenced by the filth that surrounds them in their own city, how everyone is playing a specific role to survive in the city,etc. Lastly the car chase is absolutely riveting as you would expect from a Freidkin film. Now let's talk about the flaws. The style of storytelling and the screenplay is very poor. With the interesting themes that are explored, this could have been a much better film with a better screenplay. But unfortunately this isn't the case. The cheesy 80s pop music trivialises everything that happens. The dialogues are very contrived and forced and the script involves too may unrealistic conveniences. Then there is the acting which is amateurish. I generally like Willlem Dafoe, but even he can't make up for the lack of acting from the rest of the cast and with dubbed over lines, the situation just gets worse. The film's themes had potential but unfortunately it fizzled out in the end.",To Live and Die in L.A.
62,rooee,Predator and prey stalk 80s L.A.,9,6 November 2016,"""I'm getting too old for this s**t,"" one character utters early on in this stylish 1985 thriller from the formidable William Friedkin. The veteran director doesn't bring much of his recent black humour to this hard-boiled cop thriller, but the brutal cynicism is present and correct. After the questionable Cruising and the forgotten comedy Deal of the Century, this was Friedkin back on Sorcerer form. William Peterson, who would smoulder even more intensely the following year in Michael Mann's Manhunter, plays Secret Service agent Richard Chance. And boy does he take chances. A thrill-seeker who spends his spare time bungee-jumping off bridges, when his soon- to-retire partner is gunned down he goes after the culprit with reckless abandon. His prey is Rick Masters (Willem Dafoe), a completely amoral counterfeiter who slaughters with a smile. Chance is paired with a by-the-book agent named Vukovich (John Pankow), who's dragged deeper into this violent mess thanks to a ruthless code of honour. What ensues is an action thriller somewhere between the rawness of Friedkin's own The French Connection and the glossy buddy thrillers that were soon to become a Hollywood staple. There are shoot outs, intricate car chases, fist fights, and a conspicuous amount of ball-kicking. You can forgive some of the film's flaws for their pay-off. Sure, Chance might blunder into situations with face-palming recklessness, but that's consistent with his character. Similarly, even when the storytelling is stripped down to the point of being nonsensical (characters leap about locations in the space of a jump cut), you accept it for the thrilling briskness and the efficiency of storytelling.You won't be surprised that Peterson excels at glowering and Dafoe revels in his menace. Chance isn't a complex character but he does take us on a journey, from sympathy to something like repulsion. He exploits others and ignores the rule of law to get the job done – so, is he so different from the villain he's preying upon?Par for the genre, women are sidelined as strippers or victims, although in Friedkin's defence the ample nudity is generous to both genders. Plus, in a thematic sense, one could see the film as one big critique of the single-minded alpha male. If there are winners in the end, it's not who you'd expect. On the whole, however, expectations are satisfied more than they are defied. Cliché follows cliché, but it's all done with great energy and style. L.A. is perennially clad in orange sunset, and the saucy 80s rock soundtrack (from British new-wavers Wang Chung) locks the film in time. Mann would remake his own 80s effort with Heat in 1995, providing the final word on the L.A. neo-noir genre. But in To Live and Die we see its overture: a relocated Miami Vice writ large. It's nasty, dated, and fun.",To Live and Die in L.A.
63,SMK-4,Shamefully misunderstood by the critics,10,29 April 1999,"One of the very best films of the 1980s this was shamefully neglected and misunderstood by the critics.  The problem is: on the surface it's just like an ordinary action crime thriller (and thus won't appeal to the arthouse crowd), except that it makes it difficult to identify yourself with any of the characters.  In other words: it violates its genre rules.  But this very fact makes it so unpredictable and thrilling, and a proper movie as opposed to a mere genre clone.The good guys are flawed.  This isn't really new, since the mid 1960s there were plenty of flawed heroes in Westerns or police thrillers.  The difference is that not only their characters are flawed, they are vulnerable, destructible, they make mistakes.  And they pay for their mistakes.  Similarly the villains: yes, they are formidable and glamorous, but they are not in the league of the Blofelds or Sentenzas of moviedom. They make mistakes too.  And they pay too.A surprising asset is the film music by Wang Chung, a one-hit-wonder pop obscurity of the era.

64,XxEthanHuntxX,Brottsplats Los Angeles - Änglarnas stad - 80,8,15 June 2020,"After a series of flops, it was time to show the outside world that William Friedkin was still a director to count on. With ""To Live and Die in L. A."", a very underrated (and forgotten) 80s movie that has a high tempo, Friedkin managed to make a new brilliant riveting police thriller with (at that time) more unknown actors. In terms of action, its surprisingly brutal and, in addition, contains both a fantastically directed car chase and a snazzy 80's synth soundtrack banging in the background. But also contains a rather strange plothole in the introduction.The viewer is offered an classic honest hard-boiled police experience, with an film which seems to know a lot about counterfeiting and also about the interior policies of the Secret Service. The film isn't just about cops and robbers, but about two systems of doing business, and how one of the systems finds a way to change itself in order to defeat the other.",To Live and Die in L.A.
65,jcbutthead86,One of the best Action-Thrillers ever made. One of Friedkin's best..,10,24 August 2012,"To Live and Die in L.A is one of my favorite movies of all time and one of the best Action-Thrillers ever made. Dark,unforgettable, and uncompromising, To Live and Die in L.A is an underrated classic and one William Friedkin's best films.To Live and Die in L.A tells the story of a secret service agent named Richard Chance(William Petersen) who is apart of a secret service unit that takes down counterfeit money and counterfeiters in Los Angeles. When Chance's retired partner Jim Hart(Michael Greene) decides to investigate a master counterfeiter named Rick Masters(Willem Dafoe),but Masters kills Jim Hart in the process. Now looking for revenge, Richard Chance will do anything to get Rick Masters even if it means breaking the law.To Live and Die in L.A is an amazing film from beginning to end that was so dark and uncompromising in the 80's it's not a surprise the film wasn't a hit in 1985. Action films at the time were dominated(to a great deal) by Arnold Schwarzenegger and Slyvester Stallone where the characters in Arnold and Sly's films were likable,invincible and heroic. But in To Live and Die in L.A the characters in this film are unlikeable and unheroic and that is one of the things I love about the film. TLADLA while a Action-Thriller,the characters,especially the two main characters are rooted in the attitudes and spirit of Film-Noir where the characters and their attitudes are pessimistic and dark. The city of L.A. while still showing palm trees and sunlight is told with a dark light,giving viewers an L.A That wasn't seen at the time during the 1980s. L.A at that time and now often associated with Hollywood and glamour,but this film shows the other side L.A as a ugly,dirty and dark place. TLADA is an Action-Thriller that pulls no punches and gives viewers a film that is unpredictable and done with a nihilistic mean streak where you never know what's going to happen or when and you as a viewer are put in a since of uneasiness and dread. What I also love about TLADLA is the way it takes the genre of the Cop film and turns the genre on it's head giving viewers a Cop film that takes the conventions and trademarks of Cop movies and goes the opposite direction because you think is going to go one way but goes another way making TLADLA a surprising film that has a lot of twists you won't see coming. The two main characters Richard Chance and Rick Masters,while on opposite sides of the law,are mirrors of each other because both are obsessive with what they want to do whether it's Chance taking risks with his life in the secret service trying to catch Rick Masters or Masters making counterfeit money or Masters being a painter. Both are living on the edge doing what they do and you have the feeling that their lifestyles are going catch up with them. TLADLA is I think one of the few films to show what counterfeiting money is and how it works,especially how Rick Masters makes the money and how people in the film except counterfeit money as real money and the secret service wants to bust people carry the fake money. Friedkin also shows not only the counterfeit world in the money,but in the people too with the secret service,characters emotions and their motivations. The Action scenes are so great,raw and brutal that you feel that no character in the film is safe and they're not done with a joke or a pun like in the Schwarzenegger or Stallone films,but with danger and surprise. The car chase scene is in the film is one of the greatest Action and car chase sequences in movie history. Well directed and fast-paced,the car chase is one of the all-time great Action scenes and a classic scene that's up there with The French Connection. The ending is one of the most shocking and surprising endings in film history and literally made my jaw drop. I think the reason the ending is so shocking is because it was something you rarely saw in 80s films or in most Action-Thrillers then and now where everything works out in the end. The ending fits in with the dark and gritty tone of the film and is one of the reasons TLADLA is a classic.The cast is great. William Petersen is excellent as Richard Chance bringing an intensity and toughness to the role as the agent who wants to bring Rick Masters down. Willem Dafoe is brilliant as counterfeiter Rick Masters who in my opinion is one of the best villains in movie history. Dafoe is frightening and totally believable. John Pankow is wonderful as John Vukovich,Chance's new partner who's torn between his loyalty to the secret service and Chance. Debra Feuer is fantastic and sexy as BiancaMasters' girlfriend. John Turturro does a great job as Carl, Masters' associate. Darlanne Fluegal is great and beautiful as Ruth Chance's informant and sex partner. Dean Stockwell does a great job as Bob Grimes Masters' lawyer. Steve James(Jeff) and Robert Downey SR(Thomas Bateman),Michael Greene(Jim Hart),Christopher Allport(Max Waxman),Jack Hoar(Jack) and Val DeVargas(Judge Filo Cedilo)also do good jobs in their roles.William Friedkin's direction is excellent,gritty,dark and stylish showing the city of Los Angeles that wasn't seen at the time in the 80s from the freeways,dirty streets,corners,vibrant colors and palm trees. Great movie-making from Friedkin.The score and soundtrack by Wang Chung is excellent and fits with the film perfectly with the title theme song To Live and Die in L.A being my favorite. The only film that i think that can match the soundtrack in To Live and Die in L.A is Manhunter(Another great underrated classic thriller).In final word, if you love Action-Thrillers or films in general I suggest you check out To Live and Die in L.A one of the best Action Thrillers ever made and a excellent underrated classic. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",To Live and Die in L.A.
66,jldmp1,Cycles Of Counterfeiting,10,4 May 2009,"This movie has been at the top of my list of favorites since its release. It was the perfect movie for the mid-80s moment -- the ultimate expression of Friedkin as style triumphalist. Though the jarring techo soundtrack dates it quite a bit now, and the MTV-patterned rapid-fire film cutting was a product of its time, the core of Friedkin's work still holds up.This is, of course, film noir, most evidently in the way the characters are at the mercy of a capricious fate - the 'invisible vise' alluded to in the theme song. But there's another level that sets this apart. The entire movie is about counterfeit relationships (as he further explains in the DVD extras), and this extends to our relationship to what we think we're seeing. Friedkin continually twists and contorts the act of -our- watching, momentarily holds us there, then snaps us back into shape. The effect is unsettling. The prime example is when Dafoe's character is approached by a dancer whose shoulders and arms (seen from behind) are too muscular to be a woman's. They kiss, then in the next shot, the dancer is revealed to be his main squeeze, Feuer. Their sex scenes also have some very, shall we say, unlikely positions for woman to be in relation to a man. These and many other examples add up to make the point: the viewer's relationship to the movie is a counterfeit one as well, and the effect of Friedkin's manipulation of this is what endures long after the tendentious qualities wear off.And that car chase. It still is the finest one ever committed to film, as far as I'm concerned. Obviously, Friedkin's goal was to top himself on his ""French Connection"" car chase, but it goes well beyond that. Essentially, it is the chase sequence in ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"", right down to the ""Who are these guys?"" banter, reimagined with cars. The point-of-view flashback to the BASE jump is part of this too. It's only there for a fraction of a second, but it speaks volumes about Friedkin's trust in us to understand the perspective he had in mind. Brilliant.Also brilliant is the ending, which isn't one. Friedkin had the good sense to ditch the happy ""Beverly Hills Cop"" ending. He simply looped the visual narrative right back to where we started, with Pankow as Petersen reincarnated, and the cycle spins on...without end.Other interesting bits...it's remarkable how multicultural LA was at the street level back then, what with all the bodega signs and beer ads in Spanish - you would not see this in a studio production at the time.Also, the opening assassination attempt on Ronald Reagan (who made public appearances in real life with writer/ex-agent Petievich) is shockingly to the point. The would-be bomber is Islamic and loudly announces 'death to the Zionist villains', in so many words. Try to imagine that, today...CAIR and other grievance/agitator groups would be all over the studio for 'failure to show cultural sensitivity' and 'negative depictions of stereotypes'.

Chance is very sure that Masters is responsible for the murder of Chance's soon-to-be retired partner. Masters is portrayed by Willem Dafoe, who is great here and shows that his character shouldn't be trifled with. The film's highlights are a couple of chase scenes (the exciting car chase tops the foot chase for sure) and the final showdown between Vukovich and Masters in a room that's filled with counterfeit equipment on fire. I have to admit here that I see the Vukovich as the film's hero because of one simple reason - he survives and Chance doesn't. Peterson, Dafoe, and Pankow are backed by a reliable supporting cast that includes John Turturro, Steve James, and Dean Stockwell.

On one hand, there is a great cat and mouse battle between the secret service and a counterfeitor.  The performances are very good in this film.  The biggest gripe I have about the film is that it has an unpleasant tone. Though the performances are good, the character of William Petersen is unlikable that his fate comes as no surprise to the audience.  This is something that didn't happen to Gene Hackman in The French Connection. Whatever you think of Popeye Doyle, you did root for him.  Not in this movie.  But since William Dafoe's character isn't much better, you end up with two bad guys in the end.  Overall, stylishly made but somewhat offputting.  7/10",To Live and Die in L.A.

73,Aly200,An Underrated Crime Thriller,8,20 January 2017,"William Friedkin of ""The Exorcist"" fame went back to his crime film roots with this well executed action thriller based on a former LAPD agent's book of the same name. The story is relatively simple at the start as the film has two officers (William Petersen and John Pankow) of the U.S. Secret Service out to catch a notorious counterfeiter (Willem Dafoe) who killed the partner of one of the agents. The narrative takes several twists and turns as the agents race to take down their target, but keep learning along the way that it won't be an easy task to catch a smart criminal mastermind without prices being paid for their dedication.As the heroes (or in Petersen's character's case, an anti-hero), Petersen and Pankow display a unique chemistry that keeps their characters on opposite sides of the same case; Petersen's Chance will go beyond the law to catch their counterfeiter prey while Pankow's Vukovich is the by-the-books agent who soon learns he must go outside the rules to get the man they are after. The show primarily belongs to William Petersen's Chance as he is the driving force for the action since he is the one whose partner is killed early in the film. Petersen oozes a brash personality that counters the more reserved and just Vukovich that John Pankow plays.Playing the film's villain in one of his earliest starring roles is the ever charismatic and talented Willem Dafoe as the calculating and brutal Rick Masters. He is the counterfeiting mastermind Chance and Vukovich are desperately chasing, but Masters is always a step ahead. From brutally executing Chance's first partner, Jim Hart, to his masterful counterfeiting operation to even more crueler slayings for anyone who double-crosses him, Dafoe keeps a sinister charm to his portrayal of Masters and conveys his quiet intelligence with his trademark soft-spoken voice. Friedkin helped write the film's screenplay with some assistance from source writer, Gerald Petevich, and Petevich's brother. The director quite easily has control of their script which is clear from what is shown on-screen. However this does not dumb down the tension of the film as the clock ticks down the days and time of the action. If you want a pot-boiling action film that will have on the edge of your seat, I recommend this film.",To Live and Die in L.A.
74,buzznzipp1995,Blistering account of the counterfeit underworld...,10,13 July 2006,"Totally drawn into the dialog and the activities surrounding counterfeiting, when I watched this for the first time in 1990 on video. I was with friends and we sort of got into it, but anytime you have friends over to watch a movie, unless they understand getting completely into a story, (shutting-up and watching/listening) forget it. I missed little bits and parts of it. So later, when I saw it and remembered, I talked the rental manager into selling it to me (that copy wasn't for sale) and I didn't own a laser disc player yet back then. I knew that I wanted it however. I bought the movie on laser disc. The last discontinued disc for $45.00 out of a small 'Wherehouse Music and video' in Santa Barbara, California.When I bought a laser player (finally) watching it alone this time, I was set back at what I had missed. The music was this Erie undeniable character all it's own. The various depths of emotional darkness and mixing colors of the city scape. The grittiest parts of 'industrial' Los Angeles. The differing tones and moods, the build up of sudden frantic flight of action and then...the calm silence. The underworld players and polarization between the ranks,of the players from great to medium-level to small timers and yet blending. It was strangeness, however I couldn't break away. There was also a man in the film, Rick Master's (the counterfeiter) right arm man, the muscle, named Jack (Played by Jack Hoar) now this man I had never seen before, but I knew this guy was too good to be nothing, or just some actor with a character to play named 'Jack'. No offense to actors, but this guy seemed totally real. He was big and imposing, solid in mass, huge hands. When Jack pushed Peterson's character 'Richard' up against the wall by his throat, I almost peed my pants!! I got scared. I knew in real life that guy is too big to just push out of the way. Hell he's as big as a wall. Probably as solid too!!! I found out he was in fact not a career actor, but now, in 2006 he is a retired officer,(L.A.) with quite an impressive credited resume. Special weapons, explosives, on the Anti-Gang Unit, etc, etc. This man was the perfect choice for an underworld character's 'Enforcement Department'. He played in a couple other things a few years later, but not much since. You know this man's 'rolls' are not going to be the 18 year old love sick kid 'parts'. He is more like a Big Bad-Ass John Wayne, than anything else. Hey and that's cool, he doesn't even have to act to pull it off. Because it's real for him. Enjoy the Film and the special features on the Special Edition D.V.D. And to jack I say ""Be safe. Keep on trucking!!!""",To Live and Die in L.A.
75,gilligan1965,Great movie depicting how law enforcement 'should' act!,9,7 June 2015,"I've loved this movie ever since I saw it shortly after its release; and, I still love it now.This US Secret Service agent, Chance (William L. Peterson), is the kind of devoted 'cop' whom. if every cop was like, there would be 90% less crime; as well as much less money spent on courtroom bs for criminals; and, more attention placed upon jailing crooked high-society lawyers who defend known criminals.Sure, he 'bends' the law, but, he gets answers and results, to the dismay of his ""pencil-neck"" pencil-pushing boss, which almost every 'cop' movie has.I would think that the worse thing for a cop is when a case becomes personal, as in this movie; but, it's probably the best thing for society when this happens because the cop is 'sure' to do his job to the fullest.However...with the exception of the real 'Serpico,' this is all a pipe-dream. The only people in crime/drama movies who are true-to-life are the criminals, because they're the only ones who put their 'all' into their jobs.Despite all of this, this is a great action-packed movie on a realistic level; it stars great actors; and, it has a great and believable story.I really love this movie, and, I recommend it to all those who love crime/dramas.",To Live and Die in L.A.

The story examines at what price a federal agent is willing to go in order to get his guy. The villain might be a bad individual, but the steps that the agents take to get him, just might rival him. Peterson is terrific and Willam DeFoe is just outstanding. The look is very art deco and makes you think you are watching a Michael Mann film. Moreover, the car chase scene rivals any in movie history. Well developed characters, smart plots and supreme performances make this one of the best films of the 1980's. **** out of ****.",To Live and Die in L.A.

The cast in 1985 was pretty much unknown, save for Willem Dafoe. William Petersen showed his chops as an actor in this film as did John Pankow, an under-appreciated, gifted actor. The film has brilliant cinematography of L.A. by Robby Muller and state of the art editing by M. Scott Smith. Director William Friedkin (The French Connection) shows us his deftness as an action-adventure director extraordinaire as if we needed any more proof. This film has one of the top 3 chase scenes ever. It made me sweat. It was an unbelievably nerve-wracking part of a really tense, but enjoyable film. There are one or two shocking scenes that I won't go into, but if and when you see this terrific film you'll know exactly of what I'm speaking.

80,blazesnakes9,Another 80's action flick.,8,14 May 2011,"To Live and Die in L.A. is a urban action movie that takes in the realistic jungle of Los Angeles itself. In To Live and Die in L.A., William Peterson plays an Secret Service agent who is tracking down a counterfeiter. The bad guy is played by Wilem Dafoe and he is a good choice for the villain because his character is a smart villain, but sometimes menacing. Peterson's character is a daredevil of the city. There is one scene in the movie where a chase occurs. The chase begins under a bridge, then it transfer to the canal of the city. And then the suspense builds in. The chase goes right into the wrong lane on the highway. While watching this chase, I was appalled by the action sequences and the great direction of William Friedkin, who also directed, The French Connection. In that movie, he made a great and famous car chase. To Live and Die in L.A. has only one car chase in the film and it is terrific.

81,Hawkensian,"No matter how hard I try, I just cannot like this film in its entirety.",5,9 August 2012,"'To Live and Die in L.A.' is ultimately something of a snorefest; watch this with even a grain of lethargy and you'll be lost. And that's a shame, because there is much artistic merit to be found in the film. The killer Wang Chung soundtrack compliments stylish sequences throughout, and is especially effective when capturing the Los Angeles landscape. The opening montage is very striking both visually and aurally; the sequence showing Master's counterfeiting procedure is also a pleasure to watch. Sadly though, the first twenty minutes and the closing credits of the film are the most interesting and engaging. And even its stylistic flair becomes tired, Wang Chung being overused and placed in sequences that just don't require it. 'To Live and Die in L.A.' could've been far tauter; it rouses you from your catatonic state only a few times with its surprising gore and of course that famous lengthy car chase. The premise is simply Richard Chance's (William L. Peterson) relentless pursuit of a murderous counterfeiter named Eric Masters (Willem Dafoe) who has killed Chance's partner and 'best friend for seven years'. Chance, whose safety is hindered in the haze of his own hubris, is prepared to do whatever it takes to put an end to Masters, even if it means breaking the law he enforces. Peterson's anti-hero clearly isn't without his clichés. I noticed that when presented with new partner John Vukovich (John Pankow), the film delivers the common 'You know I work alone' trope. In its entirety, 'To Live and Die in L.A.' is a superficial, viewer-unfriendly production that just doesn't engage its audience. The characters are unsubstantial, the plot is tediously bloated and hard to follow and its aesthetic redeeming features soon become tired over its 1hr 56 minutes. Not even director William Friedkin could save it; it wouldn't be until his collaboration with writer Tracy Letts 20 years later that he would return to the form of 'The Exorcist' and 'The French Connection'. www.hawkensian.com",To Live and Die in L.A.
82,frankwhat,Good Enough,7,5 November 2004,"I rented this because Willem Defoe is one of my favorites! He usually picks bad movies to be in though but this was actually a good turn for him. Granted it wasn't ""Platoon"" but I liked it...and he did a great job acting-wise. However the lead cop wasn't that good of an actor, it seemed like he just memorized his lines, chewed them up, and spit them out. He came off like a jerk okay but probably because he's only one in real life. This is by no means an uplifting film and anyone that wants a happy one should look elsewhere since the ending is very grim and dismal. Despite it being a decent enough flick overall I thought it hosted one of the corniest car chase sequences I have ever seen as it looked so fake. The shoot outs during the chase were okay but the cars speeding along in fast motion was horrid and it just looked heinous. I mean it is 80's style though so that explains at least some of it. What really saved the story was just how corrupt everyone was and you never knew who was going to wind up on top or how it'd end. As far out as it seems I'm willing to bet that situations like this actually occur in real-life more often than not.Final Rating:Movies: Not now because some parts are outdated.DVD Purchase: I liked it but if I want to see it, I'd rather just rent it again.Rental: A good one for you crime/action lovers out there!",To Live and Die in L.A.

Acting is on the highest level as usual with Friedkin's films before the 90's.The death of the main protagonist in the end was little expected and adds to this movie's realistic nature.I liked both Petersen's and Pankow's performance,and Dafoe was interesting as well.The music choice was also interesting,although at times not so suitable.All in all,this is a very enjoyable thriller and another thrilling experience from Bill Friedkin,which occasionally brings back the flashes of the brilliance of ""French Connection"",although the two films can hardly be compared since they are made in two different epochs and both distinctively carry the essence of their time.Sadly,Friedkin's thriller of the 90's failed to follow in the footsteps of its predecessors.I think this film deserves a 9.",To Live and Die in L.A.

86,vandelour,Crippled by actors,4,19 April 2015,"So much potential, such bad casting. I'm giving this film a 3..no, on second thought make that a 4 only because I generally like Friedkins view on the world (Sorcerer, Fr Connection) and he always gets good camera-work out of his stuff. But this film my god, the acting of Petersen and Pankow is beyond ridiculous. Everything about those two is ridiculous, dialog, behavior, the way they dress it absolutely cripples the movie. Turrturo was excellent as was Dafoe. The rest of the cast was fine but when you have two disco-zombies like Petersen and Pankow prancing around in their tight levis, flashing skin, Petersen stumbling along in his high-heel cowboy boots, both of 'em doing some heavy male 'bonding' and then the final scene involving Pankow - - which is so utterly ridiculous (I know I'm using this word a lot here but dammit it fits) that I laughed out loud, well, even a Friedkin fan has to choke on his popcorn.Good chase scene though. And given the latest revelations regarding the 'professionalism' of the Secret Cervix, maybe its not that far off.",To Live and Die in L.A.
87,sc8031,"Losers, all!",7,18 July 2008,"Despite a confusing (or irrelevant?) opening segment, To Live and Die in L.A. is an authentic and somewhat disturbing crime film. In fact, some of the film is so harrowing and caustic it evokes almost horror-like inspiration. As you might have heard by now, it involves one of the finest car chase scenes ever put to film.The film follows a couple of Secret Service agents for the National Treasury as they try to track down a counterfeiter. As the movie rolls on, it becomes clear that these agents are pretty shady in the way they gleam information and that the ties between crime and justice are actually quite close. I know, it sounds like an obvious plot, but the editing, pacing, characters and twists are all pretty unexpected or original. It is not nearly as cliché as it sounds.The downsides to the movie could be some of the aesthetic choices: the neon colors are sweet (I think) but some of the soundtrack is just too grating. You REALLY feel like you're hopped up on speed after hearing the main theme for too long. It's done by Wang Chung, but I think Tangerine Dream would've created something much more provocative. Oh well. Also, I felt like one or two characters' stories were not really concluded properly. There was a minor hang-nail or two left at the end. But all in all, this is a solid film. Very inspired, very dark, simultaneously exciting and depressing. Seriously, this movie is way more intensely real than anything Tarantino has tried to do. It may not actually be more violent per say, but the violence itself it much more effective and the social ties are far more believable. This junk is scary.",To Live and Die in L.A.
88,wilsonstuart-32346,Blood Drenched and Neon Lit Crime Thriller...,9,23 September 2018,"..set where elee but in L.A, City of Fallen Angels (to quote James Ellroy), freeways, superficiality, corruption, racism and violence. Quite a backdrop for a stylish 1980s crime thriller where everyone chases money that isn't real, produced by an artisically inclined killer who doesn't actually want or need it.Like all good cult films, William Friedkin's thriller was modestly successfully, with some mixed reviews, on initial release. It's much more appreciated now, and personally I love it. Packed with Friedkin's signatures - sleazy undertones, amoral anti-heroes, brutal violence, street level viewpoints and questionable motives - the battle between William Petersen's adrenaline fuelled, macho and appalling reckless Secret Service agent (with a dubious, out of his depth John Pankow in tow) and Wilhelm Dafoe's dangerously charismatic and ruthless counterfeiter, takes on almost supernatural dimensions.The film has a very distinctive 1980s feel, but is curiously timeless. Although contemporary audiences preferred Lethal Weapon, To Live...formed the template for the high tempo, grey area police procedurals we're so familiar with today...only this one does not hesitate to show the ugly consequences of ill-thought out decisions and corner cutting gone wrong.",To Live and Die in L.A.

90,raymond_chandler,A Thrilling Look at the Mission of the US Secret Service,9,24 October 2003,"I have watched ""To Live and Die in LA"" dozens of times, and I never tire of it. Willem Dafoe creates one of the most fascinating characters in all of cinema. Masters is extremely intelligent, sophisticated, fearless, and 100% deadly. He treats crime like an extreme sport, has a strong code of honor, and is a bracing change from the standard psychos and one-dimensional thugs in most crime thrillers. As Chance, William L. Peterson is fiercely dedicated to his job, but is blinded by his own loyalty, rage, and single-mindedness. His unrelenting pursuit of Masters turns LA upside down, leaving carnage in his wake. The use of locations is unparalleled, showing us a vast, sun-baked riot of a city, so gritty you can almost taste the dust in your throat and feel the acrid haze of smog stinging your eyes. The music and clothes are dead-on, as the opening sequence sets us down right in the middle of the Reagan 80s, literally. John Turturro and Dean Stockwell are superb.What really elevates this movie is the plot and script. It takes numerous twists and turns, always at 90 mph. It shows us things that no other movie about law enforcement dares to, simultaneously breaking numerous rules of screen writing. The characters are three-dimensional, with believable motivations and dialogue that reveals their personalities, instead of just advancing the plot. As many others have noted, the line between good and bad gets very blurry in this world. The heightened, exaggerated reality presented here is exactly why I go to movies. This one is a true classic.Did I mention Dean Stockwell is FANTASTIC? Oh, and there's a car chase, too (heh).",To Live and Die in L.A.
91,mgtbltp,Smog Noir in the City of Angels,9,6 March 2016,"Beautifully bleak and highly stylistic. This film actually makes a lethally smoggy industrial West Coast/LA sunrise jaw dropingly gorgeous, perverting the normal aesthetic. Palm trees compete with power poles and high tension lines that diffuse into a yellowish soup. Rail yards and wrecking yards are bathed in golden light. All this segues into a montage of a series of varied illegal counterfeit $20 bill transactions. The tale is about three US Secret Service Agents who are headquartered in L.A. When not providing security for a visiting POTUS (President of the United States) they do field investigation work for the US Treasury, targeting counterfeiters. Richard Chance (Petersen) and Jim Hart (Greene) are top notch agents. Chance the cock of the walk, is a bit reckless, a bit overconfident, a bit of a jock, a bit shady, he even shacks up in a ""safe house"" with a stripper Ruth Lanier (Darlanne Fluegel) that he uses as a ""stoolie with benefits"". He holds her probation and the ability to see her daughter as leverage. Agent Hart is the veteran, steadfast, partner who is almost a father figure to Chance. A day after Hart's retirement party at the Dog Run Bar, and with only a few days left on the clock, Hart heads off on one last surveillance assignment. He drives out into the desert to check on a warehouse suspected of housing counterfeiting equipment. With binoculars he checks out the site belonging to counterfeiter Rick Masters (Dafoe). Hart, thinking the site is deserted approaches and jumps the fence. He starts to poke around and finds a trash bag full of cropped currency paper in a dumpster. Masters and Jack, his bodyguard, surprise and kill Hart. Leading a team of agents to Masters desert warehouse Chance discovers a pool of blood soaking into the dirt from Hart's body lying in the dumpster. Chance gets assigned a stuffy new partner John Vukovich (Pankow), a no nonsense by the book professional. Chance tells John that he is making taking down Masters a personal vendetta. The film has a 80's techno Wang Chung pounding beat. The cast at that time (save for Dean Stockwell) where pretty much all unknowns. The mayhem ratchets up nicely and unpredictably throughout the film. It's an anti buddy cop film. Gritty, flamboyant, caustic, beautifully bleak 9/10",To Live and Die in L.A.
92,joker-scar,To love and thrill in L.A.,8,17 September 2018,"I remember seeing this film when it was originally released in 85' and loved it. Even as I was watching it, it seemed to capture the vibe of that time, the culture and Miami Vice fashion-esque pastel feel, which is usually rare when you are in the middle of living it, that comes after the time has passed. As I recall it did not do well at the box office, which is a shame. It is a taunt suspense thriller, one of Friedkin's best. Yes, the car chase was compared with Friedkin's own watershed car chase in The French Connection, but it stands on its own and fits great into the plot. When you are a great filmmaker there are always those who will continually compare past and current works, that is the pitfall of fame and as a film buff its best to ignore that stuff and just watch the film and judge for yourself. It's a wild and unpredictable ride worth adding to your disc collection.",To Live and Die in L.A.
93,jpozenel,A truly terrible movie,1,20 February 2010,"I believe that three things make this a truly terrible movie. First would be the writing. The dialog in this movie is some of the worst that I have ever heard. William Friedkin wrote the screenplay for the movie.Second and third would be the directing and the acting. William Friedkin is the director. The overall poor acting seems to be more the result of poor direction rather than several actors all putting in terrible performances.I must say that I have never seen anything that William Peterson has been involved in that I liked. I think that he is one of the worst actors I have ever watched and believe that in his case, poor directing or good directing would have made no difference. He's just a very poor actor. His on screen swagger is especially laughable.The portrayal of secret service agents in Los Angeles as ""Mod Squad"" types, was absurd. The mechanics of the chase scene were quite good, but much of it just didn't make any sense. At one point the car being chased is stopped and completely surrounded by FBI men with fully automatic weapons, and the driver (William Peterson) decides to make a run for it. This happens after one of the FBI agents was mistakenly killed. I have no doubt that in a real situation, their car would have riddled with bullets by the FBI.The camera work was good and you get the see the seedier side of L.A., but that can't possible make up for an otherwise terrible movie. I can't believe how high the rating for this movie is on IMDb. I assume there are a lot of C.S.I. fans out there that are giving this stinker high marks. Even Willem Dafoe couldn't make me like this movie any more than I do. I found the movie to be a complete joke, and a bad one, on me.",To Live and Die in L.A.

95,Nigel St. Buggering,Has not aged well,6,25 March 2005,"This film amply illustrates the danger of making a film too up-to-the-minute stylish: 20 years later, it's a dinosaur. The fashions, the lighting, the advent of bungee-jumping. It all dates the film so badly that it's distracting.To be fair, there are some pluses to the film. It has an extremely exciting chase sequence, and some unexpected plot twists (once the extremely predictable first act is out of the way). And any film with John Turturro receives an extra rating point in my book. Unfortunately, the legion of minuses overwhelm these features.The penultimate sin is the hero himself. He is, for all intents and purposes, a non-character. He has no background, no characteristics, and no motivation beyond ""you killed my partner you scumbag"". He is a boring cipher who displays personality only occasionally, and then just to be a complete jerk. The villain is a relic from when Willem Dafoe was relegated to playing two-dimensional psychos, before ""Platoon"" rescued him.But if one element hangs this film by the neck and leaves it twisting in the wind, it's the unbelievably awful score. Whoever came up with the brainstorm of hiring Wang Chung to score this film really needed to rethink his choice of career. Far from showing concern for the tempo or mood of any given scene, the music is determined to draw attention to itself. It belongs to that most specialized of musical genres, the crummy 80's new wave film score, as pioneered by Tangerine Dream. It has two modes; annoying synth-drum and irritating electronic droning. Neither serves to establish mood, and sinks every scene in which it appears. It doesn't help that any scene in which a radio is on is playing a Wang Chung song; apparently, LA had a 24-hour all-Wang Chung station in 1985.I remember this film making quite a splash at the time, and it is said to have been the inspiration for ""Miami Vice"". The extreme levels of sex and violence certainly would have been a shock for audiences at the time, and perhaps the sense of style gave it a very cutting-edge feel. Now, sadly, it's just dated and silly.",To Live and Die in L.A.

But the utter balls this movie has is awesome and it's an insanely understated piece of filmmaking from the 80's that I honestly think would be a pretty great companion piece to Scarface. Friedkin does another insanely amazing car chase that is about double the length of his most famous one from The French Connection. While not better than that film, this movie carries it's own weight and rarely buckled under it. It is a solid ride from start to finish with 2 excellent unhinged leads in William Petersen and Willem Dafoe + a surprise John Turturro appearance along with a couple other great supporting performances.

Being the early proponent of the MTV generation, fearless, fast, thoughtless and with short attention span and no idea why thinking ahead and planning should provide anything in the early movie vs being the center of wisdom and seniority in CSI is probably the sharpest contrast you can think about. But maybe same happened to me (hopefully should i say) being in similar age brackets.

The two guys need money to pay Masters up-front, so that they can bust him, but it is more money than the Secret Service can authorize.

Leonard Maltin didn't like the film, but that doesn't mean that other critics didn't like it.  I suggest that the authors of those comments check out this site's external reviews section, Roger Ebert's review especially (he gave it 4 stars out of 4).  Willem Dafoe and John Pankow both act well in this film, Willem Dafoe is well-cast, however John Pankow looks a little out of place.  My main complaint is with William L. Petersen, though, who is not a good actor in this film, and is mis-cast.  He is supposed to be a mean, ruthless guy (some say even worse than the bad guys, which I disagree with), but he definitely does not look like it, he looks more like a nice guy.  The car chase in this film is great, but I liked Ronin's more (although it was copied a lot from this film).

99,paulnewman2001,Friedkin's last stand?,8,6 October 2004,"Following his meteoric rise among the über-brats of the New Hollywood with The French Connection and The Exorcist, megalomaniac director William Friedkin spun out of control on The Sorcerer in 1977 and struggled back in 1985 to make what in retrospect looks like being the last significant movie of his career.Sadly, he was afterwards left churning out virtually anonymous garbage for TV punctuated by occasional movies such as 1990's risible killer tree horror The Guardian and 1997's superfluous TV remake of 12 Angry Men.Influenced by the slick stylings of the Miami Vice series, To Live And Die In L.A. nevertheless occupies a far more brutal and amoral world as it pits rogue Secret Service agent Richard Chance (William Petersen) and reluctant partner John Vukovich (John Pankow) against psychotic counterfeiter Eric Masters (a reptilian Willem Dafoe).Always a step behind, the agents feel they have no choice but to mount an audacious (and inevitably bungled) robbery of their own in order to bankroll themselves sufficiently to pass for potential clients and lure Masters into a trap.It take a while to acclimatise to the neon hues, designer jackets, splashy sunsets and Wang Chung's often jarring yet oddly apposite soundtrack but it's well worth the effort because at its gritty core this hectic, sweaty movie has adrenalin to burn, fine performances from the leads and supports such as John Turturro and Dean Stockwell.And don't forget to strap in for a bone-crunching car chase on LA's freeways as the hapless agents attempt to escape fellow lawmen.

I have expected some good thriller/crime in the vein of magnificent The French Connection but i was totally wrong, these movie is totally cheesy from start to finish. The plot is nothing special, the movie just goes but nothing happens at all till the end. Than we go to the main reason i didn't like these one, it is the acting. Except phenomenal Williem Defoe other cast is just disastrous. Williem Petersen and John Pankow are the pair of your dreams ha-ha i am kidding, they are so out of charisma, unoticable, boring and cheesy, especially the acting of Williem Petersen it is on the level of B-movies actors. Other supportive cast is also not worth mentioning. And on all of that just add the soundtrack of British band Wang Chung, i really like 80s music and soundtracks, but these soundtrack is not going well with the movie and even gives more b-movie atmosphere. I just give this movie 5 from 10 because of great charismatic acting by Williem Defoe, and phenomenal car chase near the end of the movie, but my advice is to skip this one, you will not regret, and you will save your precious time.",To Live and Die in L.A.
101,loogenhausen,Grissom Goes Rogue...,8,8 November 2011,"William Friedkin returned to the crime thriller genre he mastered so well with ""The French Connection"" and tuned it in to the 80's with TLADILA. It's a gritty, violent, bleak look at good guys and bad guys in the city of angels and the fine line separating the two that often gets crossed. There's lots of action, intrigue and a few surprises thrown in for good measure. After losing his best friend and partner, treasury agent Richard Chance goes on a personal manhunt for the suspect, a devious counterfeiting murderer who happens to be quite the artist. The bad guy in question, Rick Masters (Willem Dafoe) is a paranoid sociopath trying to circulate his funny money in the most effective way possible whilst trying to shake the cops and greedy associates at the same time. Meanwhile, Chance is partnered with agent John Vukovich (John Pankow) who is eager to nail the bad guys but soon realizes that Chance is one step from careening over the edge with every loose cannon stunt he pulls. TLADILA is probably most known for doing the reverse traffic car chase that's now aped more and more in movies today (Ronin, The Matrix Reloaded). But that gimmick is only one part of an exciting and elaborate set piece where Chance and Vukovich try to grab some front money for a sting against Masters and end up getting into some very hot water. Besides that chase, the film moves at a comfortable pace, never getting boring or racing to the climax without enough explanation in the story. A negative is that a few of the characters didn't get a chance to be fleshed out enough and while Dafoe's performance is good enough as the maniacal Masters, he could of and should of taken it further and to greater effect. Besides that, there's an ending that will leave you stunned and haunted; it's definitely a smart choice as far as story and overall impact. Did I mention the many songs by 80's staple group Wang Chung? That only helps to enhance the feel of cops and robbers in the ""Me Decade"".",To Live and Die in L.A.
102,TYLERdurden74,Cult Movies 25,8,26 November 1998,"25. TO LIVE AND DIE IN LA (action, 1985) Federal agent Chance (William L. Peterson) is on the trail of criminal Masters (Willem DaFoe) His mission to catch him becomes personal when Masters kills his partner. He learns of Master's attempts to sell counterfeit money. With unrelenting pursuit, and disregard for his own code of rules and laws he goes after him. But criminal Masters proves to be more than his equal.Critique: Director William Friedkin mixes aspects of his Oscar-winning 'The French Connection' with a touch of 1980s art-deco-'Miami Vice'-flash. Bringing a new depth into the 'cops and robbers' movie myth. The griminess and realism that was shown in his earlier films proved to be popular at the time. But coming into the 1980s the formula was becoming a little stale. The film concentrates more on the fine line between cops and robbers. Proving that they're not that different and thus could have interchangeable roles. Plus, the added violence, sex (of the kinky-punk type), and the art house feel was brought in. Also watch out for the highly praised chase scene on a freeway going the wrong way. Cool score by 'Wang Chung'.",To Live and Die in L.A.
103,eti55,Brilliant 80s Film Noir,9,8 February 2014,"William Friedkin gives film noir a decidedly 80s sensibility in this grim, violent, and at times disturbing story of how far seemingly ""good"" people will compromise their ethics in chasing criminals..even to the point when their actions result in people getting killed.William (CSI) Peterson plays Richard Chance, a secret service agent who already plays fast and loose with the rules. His partner is on the trail of a counterfeiter named Masters (Willem Dafoe), and while investigating the building in the middle of nowhere where Masters is cranking out his funny money, he gets killed (two days before he's supposed to retire) by Masters and his goon.Chance vows to get Masters for murdering his partner, and to do ""whatever it takes"" to accomplish this. His new younger partner, John Vukovich (John Pankow) doesn't like what he sees when he realizes just how far Chance is willing to go to avenge the death of his former partner..literally becoming just as bad as the man he is pursuing..and in the process forcing Vukovich to compromise his own morals. Vukovich, who ultimately becomes the central character, is stuck in a no-win situation: He can either rat out his partner or end up just as dirty as he is (at this point he's already well on his way).The performances are good all around. Peterson plays his role as a secret service agent who ultimately becomes unhinged with credibility (he's not wooden at all, despite what some other reviewers seem to think). Dafoe is spot on as his psychotic adversary. He's evil, to be sure, but he never becomes a cartoon character..none of the players here do. Pankow sis convincing as the conflicted agent looking for a way out of his dilemma. John Turturo makes the most of his screen time as Carl, a confederate of Masters who gets screwed over and sent to jail..and is pressuring Masters to get him out. Darlanne Fluegel and Debra Freuer play Ruth and Bianca, the women in the lives of Chance and Masters. Their relationships are complicated to say the least. Both men have a hold over them, forcing them to not only act as their lovers but to help them in their schemes.This movie is not for everyone. It's very violent and bloody in some scenes, even by today's standards. But it's a very well crafted thriller, highlighting the all-too-human failings of the characters involved. Another reviewer pointed out..correctly in my opinion..that in this movie, when people sworn to uphold the law go rogue and compromise their beliefs, bad things happen to them. This contrasts with action movies like Die Hard and Lethal Weapon, where the good guys are celebrated and there are no real repercussions..regardless how far they go out of police policy and how many innocent people are endangered (of course, in those movies, nothing that the heroes do ever gets innocent people killed..then again, in To Live and Die in LA there are no real innocents). There's also a car chase sequence which in my opinion not only out-does the legendary car-el train chase in Friedkin's The French Connection, but is second only to the one in Bullitt as the greatest of them all; it ends up on a crowded freeway..AGAINST traffic (talk about an amazing piece of stunt choreography).Only negative is a couple of scenes that didn't need to be dragged out as long as they were..especially one sequence showing Masters' process of counterfeiting bills. But in general To Live and Die in LA is taut from start to finish.",To Live and Die in L.A.

105,nutsy,"Not Bad, but Not Good Either",1,28 April 2004,"""You want bread? Then go f*ck a baker.""How's this for a setup? - William Friedkin, John Turturro, and Willem Dafoe, all together for one movie. What could go wrong? It stars William L. Petersen and has music by Wang Chung. This movie is the kind of mistake that could only happen in the 80s.This is a movie almost bereft of dialogue and none of the characters get close-ups. Our hero is a secret service agent named Chance (how lame is that?) and he's played by a wooden William L. Petersen. He's a wild kinda guy. He likes to bungee jump off bridges and shoot Arab bombers. When his partner is killed (with only three days left until retirement) investigating a counterfeiter, Chance becomes obsessed with revenge. That plot has got to be one of the most overused in film history. According to Friedkin that's alright, because this film is based on a book by a former secret service agent and it accounts some of his real experiences. It does not, however, go an inch for making this movie interesting.Some of the characters and their dilemmas could have been very intriguing if they'd actually been developed. The trouble is that, while there are other things going on, the only dialogue is that which refers to the plot, and that plot is a boring one. The great Willem Dafoe is Masters, the complicated artist who burns his paintings and provides the Los Angeles underworld with counterfeit money. He's ruthless, connected, attractive, but sadly underused. Debra Feuer is a woman who gets information for Chance in exchange for staying out of prison. They sleep together, he treats her like dirt, she wants out. She is, however, given little to say or do, and is tied down to one location for most of the film. Dafoe's girlfriend is also a character of some kind; it's hinted that she's playing him and has a lesbian relationship with a partner, but she almost never speaks and the audience never really gets to know her, so she might as well be an extra. Turturro's part is depressingly short: he's a baddie who Chance arrests, Dafoe puts an unsuccessful hit on, and pretends to turn stool pigeon in order to escape. This is all somehow connected, but with the way it's presented, you won't care.Later in the film come shifting loyalties, the dilemma of Chance's new partner (Pankow), one genuinely cool twist (I'll let you be surprised), and, what you all came to see, the car chase! The thing is a welcomed breath of fresh air. The film finally gets on the move, the bullets start to fly freely, and, best of all, we get a break from the monotonous Wang Chung score. Friedkin compared the scene to Kafka, but I think of it more as a way to keep the audience awake. It's not like this chase rivals the famous one Friedkin already had to his name, but it is fun to watch.If only that one fun car chase could make up for all that came before: a tacked on prologue, a slow, if informative lesson in counterfeiting, a bad score, and a complete lack of depth. It's sad to see these mistakes coming from a veteran director who made the only horror movie with a strong dramatic core. I went into this movie open minded and came out of it hating Friedkin. He tried to pick up on some of the grit of his Oscar Winner, not realizing that Petersen is no Gene Hackman and that 80s LA doesn't have half the character of 70s New York. If he'd changed cities his luck would have been a little better, but the real problem is the shallow script and the uninteresting direction.Don't bother with this one, folks. If you want a good cop movie, there's THE FRENCH CONNECTION, for a good car chase there's that and THE BLUES BROTHERS. Even if you wanted a better Petersen movie, there's MANHUNTER (and that's it). This movie is an uneven, poorly assembled screw up that you shouldn't seek for entertainment.",To Live and Die in L.A.
106,contronatura,The ultimate nihilistic thriller,10,27 June 2000,"When people talk about action films from the '80s, the inevitably seem to always mention two films: Die Hard and Lethal Weapon. Those are good films, undoubtedly. But let's face it: they're about as challenging and surprising as a game of checkers. This film, on the other hand, is so surprising, it goes against so many action film conventions, that it must be regarded as the best action film of the '80s. Just my humble opinion. The performances are terrific. The violence is exceptionally startling. There are no good guys, only guys who have different degrees of evil. And there are at least two moments in this film that will shock the hell out of you if you don't see them coming (which you probably won't). Check this out, you won't regret it.",To Live and Die in L.A.
107,contronatura,One of the most unpredictable and masterful action films,10,15 December 2000,"CAREFUL, SPOILERS AHEADI suppose I just had to post after reading another comment that called this film ""bloated and pretentious"", not to mention FAR inferior to Ronin(!). The only reason the two films can be compared is because they both have ""wrong way down the freeway"" car chases, so that tells you a little something about the depth of that reviewer's viewing.Anyway, To Live and Die In L.A. is simply a great, great film. I personally think it's Friedkin's finest work, a completely unpredictable, brutal, and remarkably acted masterpiece. Friedkin is crafty here. He starts it off in a most mundane fashion: a cop hunting down the bad guy who offed his partner. And, well, that is basically the whole story. But what happens in this story is just beautiful. The twists in the plot come at you out of nowhere, and the way Friedkin toys with audience expectations is terrific. William L. Peterson's Secret Service agent is presented as a risk-taking hotshot at first, the kind we see in dozens of formula films. But we soon realize his hotshot behavior is a symptom of his psychosis. He's willing to risk the lives of his partner and innocent people in order to get his revenge.
The ending of this film is particularly great, and it ends with a nice punch as Friedkin kind of lets us know who he thinks the real villain is. The final image at the end of the credits provides the answer to that I think. Also, Friedkin's insistence on making L.A. look like the hell he believes it to be is a nice touch. And, as one character finds out, there's no escape from this hell. Major love to this flick.",To Live and Die in L.A.
108,dreamingescapist,"We lucked out, Johnny, we lucked out.",9,3 September 2019,"'To Live and Die in L.A.' is often compared with William Friedkin's better known (but not much superior) 'The French Connection'. Compared often by those of course who have ever even heard of TLADILA. And compared they are mostly because both movies contain awesome car chase sequences (the majority prefer the on in 'The Frenc Connection') and morally grey protagonists. Although, I have to say that Gene Hackman's Popeye Doyle is a real Boy Scout compared with William Petersen's agent Chance (I'm not comparing the performances, but the characters).'To Live and Die inL.A.' is stylish and intense to its core. Beautiful cinematography that turns the city of Los Angeles one of the main characters of the movie accompanied by an awesome soundtrack by Wang Chung. William Petersen acts his soul out to greate adrenaline junky, work-obsessed Secret Service agent on the hunt of the infamous counterfeiter. To be exact - that one particular criminal is agent Chance's obsession, who he needs to capture at any costs. And the costs are getting pretty high. The counterfeiter, Rick Masters, is portrayed by ever great Willem Dafoe with an equal amount of intensity and intelligence. The psychological tension when these two play cat and mouse with each other makes the screen sizzle even more than all those hot and colorful explosions we so often see nowadays.Criminally unknown and underrated movie. Easely Top10 action thrillers of the 1980s.",To Live and Die in L.A.
109,daniel-kyle,"Twenty years later, still a great movie.",10,23 February 2004,"I am a huge fan of good (action) movies, and have a large collection.  The recent DVD release of ""T.L.&D.in L.A."" finally brings back a classic that has been unavailable due to the owner of the film, and original issuer of the VHS video, going out of business.  In my opinion, there are very few films of this type from the past twenty years, and not many directors who make them.  I can think of only two:  Michael Mann, with my all-time favorite ""Heat"", and the director of this movie, William Friedkin, who will probably always be known for delivering (most of) the best car scenes ever done in films. Though a few reviewers have called this 'dated', I think it shows a time when movies really delivered the goods.  Comparably, American television had shows like ""A-Team"", ""Airwolf"", and ""Hardcastle & McCormick"".  To anyone looking for that type of colorful bravado, this movie will not disappoint. Also, the soundtrack is from Wang Chung, and not 80's pop hits, so it holds up well over the years, much like Tangerine Dream does in other old movies. Enjoy!",To Live and Die in L.A.

111,praveen77,Vintage 80's cop drama,7,7 November 2009,"Somehow, I just love the feel and styles of the '80's. The music, the fashion statements, the hair styles and the movies. Maybe it's just because I was a kid in the Eighties, and the days of your childhood are mostly what you have a longing for.So, the other day, when I started to watch 'To Live and Die in LA', I knew there was a very small chance that I would dislike the movie. And I liked it. From the opening sequence soundtrack to the style and swagger of the lead character, to the ladies. The movie is about a daredevil cop, Chance, who likes a bit of BASE jumping along with his job. His partner is about to retire from duty in a few days, but gets killed while trying to track down a lead on counterfeit money being produced in LA. The counterfeiter, Rick Masters (William Dafoe in a wonderfully wild and wicked role) shoots him down and leaves him to the dead. Chance decides he wants to track down the killer no matter what the methods used. He gets assigned with the seemingly by the book, nervous Vukovich. However, as Vukovich starts to work with Chance and trusts him, he slowly begins to come around to his way of thinking. The rest of the movie deals with how Chance and Vukovich, with the help of Chance's ultra sexy informer, tracks down Masters. The climax is something worth waiting for, as it hits the viewer unexpectedly and suddenly.The acting is good enough, though not great. The look and feel of the movie reminded me a bit of Michael Mann's Miami Vice TV series in the eighties. Though William Peterson was good as Chance, I did wonder how it would have been if the more suave and sophisticated Don Johnson had played the lead. Oh, and there a pretty explicit sex scene between Chance and his informer as well.All in all, a pretty good watch for anyone who likes cop movies, and a must watch for the fans of the eighties.",To Live and Die in L.A.
112,wall17,It's a fascinating flick...,9,17 June 2001,"Missed this the first time around, but I've watched it in whole or part a dozen times or more on video and cable since, and it's amazing how rewarding the re-watch is. I would recommend getting it on video, though, since the TV cuts significantly mush out the impact of some scenes (the parts cut out are the usual language, sex, and violence, but I think the kinky sex in particular -- there's not a lot but it's an establishing part of the movie's tension -- is an integral part about the comment on the ""normalcy"" of all the characters. So -- get it on video if you can if you've never seen it before, resist the temptation to catch it on basic cable.)I'm not sure what contemporary critics thought of this movie, but it's much more complex than the surface description of the plot suggests. At the same time, it's a classic action flick. The ""LA"" is a far cry from most glitzy LA crime capers, and the cinematography is really cool in suggesting this sense of alternative reality: the palettes are neon but oddly muted. Other than the truly frenetic highway chase scene in the middle (better, imho, than the one in French Connection!)-- in which the ""good"" guys are being chased by other ""good"" guys -- it's an eerily empty LA.And as others have noted, the plotting is genuinely tangential to the usual conventions -- the ""hero"" / point of view shifts at least twice during the movie, minor characters turn out to be major and vice versa, strange little diversions away from the hero and villain happen all the time. Yet the plot is really easy to follow -- in fact the movie opens in the middle of the ""caper"", with much unspoken but understood -- and ends as if it's just part of a continuous story, cut off at a stopping point but not really at the end.The whole thing may be symbolic of something, and I think the very last scene in the movie is key to understanding all that came before it, such as one can. My take (just a personal thing) is that the title is meant to be taken literally -- 'To Live and Die in LA"" is a description of what it's like to live life, and die (literally or spritiually)  in the basin, the California netherworld of desert and poverty mixed up with style and money, disguised in a crime film.",To Live and Die in L.A.
113,Pinback-4,Underrated action movie from a great director,9,19 December 1999,"This is one of the most underrated films of the 80s.  A lot of critics hated it and audiences pretty much stayed away from it, and about the only thing it's remembered for is the catchy soundtrack by Wang Chung and the awesome car chase.  This is a film that I hope, along with Michael Cimino's YEAR OF THE DRAGON, a similar film that came out the same year, will be reevaluated in the years to come.  Similar to THE FRENCH CONNECTION, TO LIVE AND DIE IN L.A. is not a ripoff or imitation, but a new film made in a different style. William Petersen plays a Secret Service agent out to get a slick counterfeiter played by Willem Dafoe.  They are very good at their professions, and they have interesting hobbies when they're not working; Petersen bungee-jumps off bridges, Dafoe is an artist who burns his paintings after he completes them.  They each also have a girlfriend who are both informants.  The movie has an interesting way of presenting Los Angeles; it is seen a decadent wasteland, full of sleazy lowlifes who are out to make a fast buck at any cost.  What is noteworthy is that there are no good or decent characters in the film, except for Petersen's partner who is ambushed early in the film.  Subsequently, the line between good and bad disappears during the film, as in the scene where Petersen and his new partner played by John Pankow kidnap a man who might be a jewel smuggler. Petersen's superiors are seen as burned-out bureaucrats who couldn't care less.  In fact, Dafoe's corrupt lawyer played by Dean Stockwell shows more compassion.  The cinematography by Robby Muller and Wang Chung's music really enhance the film, especially during the opening credits and a sequence which shows Dafoe making counterfeit bills.  There is also a most unexpected development near the end of the film that would never happen in a more mainstream action thriller.  The film also features some good performances is small parts from actors like John Turturro and Steve James. All in all, this is well worth watching.",To Live and Die in L.A.
114,varsania,They don't make them like this anymore.,10,15 January 2003,"I have seen this film over 25 times and each time I notice another subtlety the brilliant Friedkin has put into this film. The film itself is the finest ever produced, in terms of directorship, casting, acting, plot, characterisation, soundtrack, and setting. You will never find a film again with the quality of actors in this film. Turturro, Dafoe, Pederson, Pankow, Stockwell. Even Chance's boss is highly complex, and he has only a small part. The way he does everything buy the book, its hilarious.
Sure there are a few flaws in this film, but these can be brushed aside because of the genius of the movie. In particular just before Chance goes into the wrong side of the freeway, I find it pretty inplausible that with all those FBI's cornering Chance and Vukovic, they just let him accelerate away. I also do not understand why Masters agreed to do business with Chance even though he knew he was US Secret Service. But this film is far to classy to worry about those minor details. THis film has some great moments, and superb lines. Watch it yourself and you will see what I mean. But I recommend you watch it at least 2 times to fully appreciate the quality of this film. It's superb.",To Live and Die in L.A.
115,shortround8391,Classic about the LA cops in the 1980's.....,10,15 February 2009,"People these days and during much of the 90's thought the LA cops as being corrupt 'cause of the Rodney King LA Riots or whatever....but this came out and is set before all that horrible riot stuff happened.This movie is VERY based on the 1980's culture, and much of the New Wave music and the clothes reflect that. and that's a good thing 'cause it gives teenagers these days an opportunity to see what the world was like before.After making the groundbreaking ""The French Connection"" in '71, William Friedkin had yet to make another slick cop movie....and he finally did that in '85....14 years later. and he distanced himself from TFC, and avoided making the same movie twice and made something totally different and more unique.This one isn't about a cop facing a drug smuggler, bank robber, terrorist or a killer or whatever.....but a counterfeiter, a psychopathic, murderous counterfeiter who would kill his own men and anyone else who gets in his way, without any remorse whatsoever. And that's Willem DaFoe in the year before he delivered that sensational performance in ""Platoon"", is perfect as Rick Masters. and dafoe even has the look of a heartless madman, and even looks like a freaking mannequin at some points in this movie.William Petersen, before his CSI days, shines as Richard Chance, the secret service agent who goes after Masters 'cause he killed his partner who was only 2 days away from retirement. Chance then becomes so enraged and he doesn't care what he has to do to arrest Masters, if that includes arguing with his boss, or taking advantage of a sexy parolee who is giving him info about Masters. He's pretty devious for a law enforcement agent and an anti-hero who you might not sympathize with.The action and the thrills are top notch, especially the historical car chase that exceeds the ones in Bullitt and Friedkin's own; ""The French Connection"". It features Chance and his new partner, Vulkovich, being chased by a couple bad guys and has cross the tracks before an incoming train and go on the wrong side of the freeway that'll keep you on the edge of your seat.There's some violence and some nudity in here, so it might not be suitable for kids, also, one more thing, the ending is gonna surprise you and this warning isn't going to be enough to save you, cause you will freak out by what happens.So, because of the LA Riots, LA cops have been forever branded as dirty and corrupt, *sigh* pretty sad, right? but LA cops are still heroes cause of all that bad crap going on over in LA today....and the 80's were even worse....I highly recommend this, I have it on Special Edition and im gonna keep this movie among my collection forever! hehe",To Live and Die in L.A.
116,Latheman-9,Uneven but good,7,24 February 2005,"In ""To Live and Die in L.A."" (TLDLA), director William Friedkin picks up his exploration of the 'cop-as-antihero' theme 14 years after Gene Hackman portrayed Popeye Doyle in Friedkin's ""The French Connection"" (1971). Notably, Clint Eastwood's performance of a similarly rule-bending cop in ""Dirty Harry"" (1971) came out that same year. But unlike in these earlier films, the protagonist here, treasury agent Richard Chance, has no redeeming virtues to speak of. TLDLA is a wonderful example of early (pre-1990s) neo-noir. All the characters are morally or ethically compromised, which is suitable for a film based on currency counterfeiting. Everything here is phony, not just the money. Motives, relationships, loyalties, goals, etc. are all fluid and unenduring with the exception of Chance's single-minded obsession to collar counterfeiting expert Eric Masters after he kills Chance's partner. Chance sets the modern leitmotif for the law enforcement officer who believes his badge makes him invulnerable, both literally and morally. More recent examples are Harvey Keitel's character in Abel Ferrara's ""Bad Lieutenant"" (1992) and Denzel Washington's in Antoine Fuqua's ""Training Day"" (2001).I saw this movie when it first came out and again on cable TV a couple of years later, but only recently has it finally been released on DVD. The scene that stuck in my mind all these years and so defines the film for me is not the ballyhooed car chase but the beautifully photographed sequence depicting the science, art, and craft of making funny money, done without dialogue. Cinematographer Robby Muller does a great job throughout the film (albeit he didn't photograph the car chase sequence) which is a significant accomplishment given that there wasn't a single studio set used in the production. The actors' performances often have an awkwardly realistic, almost 'cinema verite', quality because Friedkin wouldn't always end a shot when expected but would continue shooting, letting the actors continue the scene by improvisation. One can put this film under a microscope and pick it to death if one wanted but that misses the point of the work. It is intentionally expressionistic and realism is often sacrificed to maintain atmosphere. For example, Chance is driving a car with an automatic transmission but the rapid changes in the engine sounds used in the chase sequence are clearly those of a vehicle with a manual transmission because those fit the mood of the sequence better. The 'driving-against-traffic-on-the-freeway' portion of the chase also has a peculiarity (described as a ""goof"" by IMDb) that was actually done intentionally to add to the sense of confusion Friedkin wanted to convey. And yes, I am among those who believe Wang Chung's musical score was exactly right for this film.Shot in some of the seedier areas of Los Angeles, TLDLA will provide a lot of fun for those Angelenos who want to play the 'name-that-location' game while watching it. A fairly comprehensive list is given in the ""trivia"" IMDb page attached to this film entry. And on a final note, many of the previous comments perpetrate a seriously incorrect credit. To set the record straight, Chance's love interest was Ruth Lanier (played by Darlanne Fluegel), not Bianca Torres (played by Debra Feuer). Torres was Eric Masters's girlfriend.

117,youaresquishy,"Boring, dumb, and bad",2,8 September 2007,"This film is a good example of really bad cinema.William Peterson is the star of the film, but he is a really bad actor, and his performance here was particularly poor. One of his co-stars, John Pankow, who plays his partner in the film, is also not very good. Neither of them are in any way interesting. Both are completely wooden throughout. So, the casting alone would've prevented this film from getting any better than a rating of 4 or so.The plot was very convoluted and boring and dumb. The car chase scene was long and boring. None of the fight scenes were real-looking. Every time a punch is thrown in this film, it looks completely fake. Every time someone is shot, it looks completely fake--like fake blood is being splattered. It's almost like a bad film school project.The whole film is long and boring and makes no sense. It's as if the movie's makers wanted to make a movie with a long car chase, some fighting, some guns, and some nudity, and didn't really care about how stupid and senseless the story was or which second-rate actors played the lead roles.I don't give it a 1 because Willem Dafoe is pretty good, as usual, but there wouldn't have been anything anyone could do to save this stinker with a cast and a screenplay and directing like this. Terrible. There are hundreds of much more interesting action films to see before resorting to sitting through something like this. This is pretty much on the level of a really bad TV show.",To Live and Die in L.A.
118,criscrossin,Gritty dangerous and hard hitting cop genre,9,21 June 2019,"I was stunned by this one. From the first scene , the pulsating music burst upon me and I was hooked. It's about a hardboiled cop trying to catch the super-villain who paints and burns, but also counterfeits. Personal angle is because of the cop-partner having died. Cop loves living dangerously with bungy jumping and all adrenaline rush things. A superb car chase, opposite the flow gives you high. The interaction of the cop who utilises each and every means, unethical, immoral- with the under-parol informer, he sleeps with her but doesn't care about her, defines him. He is just at one side of the law. Which happens to be policing. He could have been just as well on the other side. He manipulates and goes for the kill. And when things go completely haywire, he is totally clueless and runs amok , just like any other random headstrong guy would do. Only the law makes the difference. When he goes off we don't really feel any empathy. We just saw his swagger. A tragedy which doesn't improve us. The titular character does his tough guy act very well. His revenge act for his partner is the only emotion he has. This film could be the template of many buddy cop films for the future.
The villain Willem dafoe is now almost legendary in acting various characters throughout for almost 4 decades. He is very young here but just as menacing.
His character is shown in broad strokes. Genius at variance with the laws of the land.
The music is always pumping up the rhythm of the grim movie. The locales also shows the underbelly and unglorified sides of the seedy town and tough neighbourhoods.
There is no feel good factor. It's not for the tame hearted. No believer in the ultimate goodness of humanity. Very realistic.
A real ride through tough times, hard times. But you don't really carry any feeling- good or bad, along with you, after it has ended.
I loved it.",To Live and Die in L.A.
119,theojhyman,Nostalgic look back at a time of innocence and corruption,9,30 September 2004,"Always heard many things about this film, but never saw it until this year - 2004. So, almost 20 years on from when it was made, it was great to see a gritty, hard-hitting thriller from a year when most Hollywood films were innocent, fantasy-comedies, sci-fi blockbusters, teen slasher pics and adventure movies.It kicks off with a very typical 80's beat, but that really got me in the mood for the film - love the music - yes, everything about the film is dated, but to me - that's great - it's very nostalgic to look back at a dark film from the 80's - a thriller that is ultra-violent, talking about crooked cops, corruption and drugs. And at the same time, the clothing and music in the film is so EIGHTIES - but that's what has given the film its place in history.Petersen is amazing in this movie. A great actor and a great performance. I love the editing, the cinematography, the lighting and use of music. Quite a shocker and disturbing, especially if you view it from an 80's perspective, where this type of movie was still quite rare and ambitious thing to do.Get the DVD - finally out! Loved the film the first time - get your friends round and surprise them with a film they may never have seen - you'll all end up enjoying this one - especially, since it has that essence of the Miami VICE look about it.",To Live and Die in L.A.
120,choatelodge,Still hard hitting,9,2 June 2004,"I must get this one off my chest, having just read the reviews posted to date. Why do so many want to slag this film so badly, even those who admit having liked, nay loved it? Is it a wish not to seem shallow in fawning over every work by a given great director? Could it be real disappointment? How so? The movie just rocks, still. Does the Wang Chung music so upset you? As has been pointed out, musical score is GOING to become dated in ANY movie. It's only today for one day fellows, get used to it.
  As you'll have divined already, I liked the movie. No point describing the plot lines again, it's been well covered by the contributers below. Dafoe conjures up a suitably believable self motivated and brilliant but heartless villain figure. Peterson is a believable good cop driven to near madness in his goal of avenging his partner. The action sequences, the violence, graphic rather than gratuitous, and the unpredictability with which characters, ANY characters at any given time, may come up against some grim or at least painful event. There is no guessing or predicting the flow of events and the action is most gratifying. What else do you want from a picture show? It to cook you dinner? I enjoyed 'To Live and Die in L.A.' heartily and I may have to write myself a note to see it again and then undergo hypnosis so I can forget how it goes. Yes it's that good.",To Live and Die in L.A.
121,edwardjamessmith,One of the greatest films of the 1980's,10,30 December 2007,"""To Live & Die in L.A.""(1985) is a fascinating motion picture. It's got everything you need to please: style (an influence from Miami Vice), grit, characters, an electrifying soundtrack and a very good acting. It's very 1980's which I love about it and what I don't understand is that it's not very well known. I remember noticing the title of the film in a TV guide on the channel Film 4 and it caught my eye but unfortunately I didn't get the chance to see it. But luckily i've finally succeeded! What I find great about 80's films is that you can recognize actors from where they started their careers (for example William Petersen who went on to do ""Manhunter"" (1986) and ""CSI"") The way its filmed is just brilliant (I really do wanna make a film like this one when I do start making films in Hollywood or elsewhere) and it's quite graphic for the time it came out back in 1985. Honestly, if you see this film anywhere buy it now and you won't regret it!

Lines like ""i like the rain."" ""oh yeah? Groovy."" Within 3 minutes of the movie starting, the senior partner goes ""I am too old for this."" Of course, he is days away from retiring, and within the next 2 minutes (after his partner warned that he should come with him to this place, he gets killed. there is no character development whatsoever. the only reason we are given that the bad guy's lawyer turns him in is that ""he was beginning to order me around like i was one of his mules"". are you kidding me? no f@#king lawyer would ever ruin his future (practice or life) and so casually decide to do it while having breakfast with an secret service person.this movie is so unrealistic and so stupid. we have no idea how any of these guys get there tips, how they end up meeting people. how did they end up at a quadraplegic artist's loft who happens to tell him that the bad guy's studio is somewhere downtown near a garage with a Chinese sign on it. Cut to agent walking up to garage sign with Chinese character on it. LA is enormous!!!!! how the hell did he find it? especially since we track the agent walking up to it and you can see that it would be IMPOSSIBLE to casually see it.how come the bad guy knows when one of his contacts is being watched by the two agents, but yet doesn't even know who they are when they go into business with him. how come the head agent happens to be sleeping with the stripper/prostitute who is the only person in town who magically always gets the information? oh gawd i am getting an ulcer from the utter mediocrity that this movie is.argh, it only gets worse. the direction is so bad. what the hell happened to friedkin? was he really a two trick pony? he throws in scenes that are completely unnecessary. why does dafoe need to be naked (gonads protected by a grocery paper bag) throwing money into a fire with a strategically placed naked lady in the background? Why does the guy talk non stop about BASE jumping (especially when it doesn't fit into his character whatsoever). Was it new and friedkin wanted to be hip? how the hell did the guys know to stop on the bridge and find the guys below? Best direction point: Why would the prison murder attempt be done in broad daylight and so obviously that the mark escapes? I mean shoot, Turturro is able to get away from FOUR big black dudes. Couldn't freidkin be more inventive in shooting the scene? he view of the attempt is two guys with enormous 'fros walking menacingly, scowling straight at him. they they jump on top of him, and still cant stab him. a high school kid could think of a better way to come up with an attempt. and, 90% of the way in, all of a sudden there are titles on the bottom of the screen, declaring the day and time. how odd is that? there hasn't been ANY in the ENTIRE movie. So why now?Look, every movie can have holes shot through it, but these aren't holes, they just don't make sense and are the result of horrible, horrible writing and directing. this movie isn't a sci fi movie, it isn't asking you to suspend disbelief. It just makes no sense that a guy gets killed even though his place is under surveillance and then a cop car comes up to his house, turns off his headlights while still up the block, pulls into the driveway, and then RUNS into the house and discovers the dead body. Why? it is 4am so the guy's secretary didn't find him dead (shoot, the agents watching him are still asleep CUZ it's dark outside) and the guys used a silencer to kill him. Who called it in? why the the cop show up? turn off his lights before he pulled up to the house? Why did he run in?In fact, what the hell does this have to do LA?

127,Holden_Pike,see under pessimism in Websters...,8,19 October 1998,"Really great, really nasty, really mean movie (but why should a movie about criminals and naked obsession be anything but mean and nasty?).  This is my favorite ""the cup is half empty"" type of movie (actually, according to this movie the cup is completely empty, and if you want a taste you better kick your way to the front of the line and shoot the water bearer in the back of the head).  The bad guys are bad and the good guys are even worse.  William Peterson is just dead-on here as a charming psychopath who happens to be a Treasury agent.  Willem Dafoe is equally good as the creepy artistic psychopath who happens to be a counterfitter.  John Pankow (years before he was wacky cousin Ira on ""Mad About You"") is also very good as the innocent partner who learns from the wrong guy how to be a cop (but learns very well).  And John Turturro gets to have fun in a small role that was a precursor to his Bernie Bernbuam in ""Miller's Crossing"".Friedkin puts these characters in the middle of a very freaky, very stylized Los Angeles.  And, because he's William Friedkin and he basically invented the modern car chase in ""The French Connection"", he goes and out-does himself with an AMAZING chase on the highway. To fully appreciate how amazing it is, watch an old ""CHiPs"" re-run - see how there are only three cars on the whole interstate and they're all going 15mph - then watch as a car is hurdled head-on through six lanes of bumper to bumper speeding traffic, mostly done in long shots so you always see sixty vehiles at a time!

I still feel this was one of his best roles. Convincing, methodical, ruthless---the classic 'anti-hero' performance has you rooting for him. The Feds? Who cares? As murderous as he, by accident or chance--exploiter of bimbos. I would have been more satisfied if he had escaped.

This last gasp of the old talent is muffled by bad dialogue and a noisy synth soundtrack from 80s beep-maker Wang Chung. Friedkin still has the eye--roving over urban decay as it once did poetically more than a decade earlier--and a few sequences wheeze up some of the old gift. But the pacing is lethargic, the story predictable, the characters banal, and the score risible. The casting stand-outs are Dafoe and Turturro, but their material is desperately thin. The lead, Petersen, is a one-noter without range or nuance. In the 70s, Friedkin, Coppola and a few others briefly restored to the Hollywood film a language of social realism and critical honesty which they used to explore the corrupt heart of American institutions; that was not going to last, obviously, and it could not survive transplant to an MTV-style aesthetic.

Petersen and John Pankow) pitted against a truly evil and cunning counterfeiter named Eric Matsers (Willem Dafoe), they must also battle the FBI and LAPD in their misguided mission. The Secret Service has always considered themselves the ""elite"" of law enforcement, and this movie, based on former Secret Service agent Gerry Petievich's novel, clearly implies that agents Chance and Vukovich are able to bend and break some of the rules, and not have to worry (much) about the LAPD or FBI catching them. As a side note, the assassination attempt against President Reagan by the Arab terrorist in the beginning of the movie, is very realistic.

About the only real false note was the part where Chance shoots the padlock off the door of the desert warehouse where Masters has been printing his counterfeit money. That is just not ordinarily a good way to breach a door. I doubt one pistol bullet could normally be depended upon to burst a sturdy padlock, and trying it would at the least temporarily deafen the shooter (if blown back metal fragments didn't actually permanently *blind* him). Use bolt cutters, or a ram, or a sledge hammer or something for things like that. Or at least have some eye and ear protection, if you're going to go shooting at locks. The actual fights, though, were pretty well done. I loved the soundtrack, and the car chase was just as great as everybody else already said it was.

Chance will stop at nothing to get Masters - he bends the rules,steals evidence and after his request to raise money to buy Masters forged notes decides to take matters into his own hands. He is also having a sexual relationship with Ruth(Darlene Fluogel)who feeds him information - in this case about a drug dealer who is carrying 50 Grand in cash and arrives the next day - Chance persuades Vucovich to rob the guy and use the cash to set Masters up - unfortunately the whole thing is a an FBI sting operation and both agents are soon way out of their depth. Chance decides to carry on with the operation but Vucovich's doubts grow and the fact that their actions led to the death of a Federal agent only makes his guilt even more intense.Its an absolutely cracking movie - excellent played characters - Peterson plays Chance as someone beyond caring for anything apart from nailing Masters and Dafoe is at his reptilian best as the forger - his grin gets more and more sinister as the film unfolds.Fine support from Dean Stockwell as a slimy lawyer and the ever excellent John Tuturro as one of Masters bagmen whom gets caught and is forced to turn stoolie. The film also has a very amoral feel to it - Chance will use anyone he can to achieve his ends - he morally blackmails Vucovich to going along and his relationship with Ruth is even more dodgy - she asks him what he would do if she stopped supplying him with information(and presumably sex) - ""I'll have your parole revoked and have you sent back to the joint""..... Fantastic photography by the great Robby Muller and a car chase through L.A. that ends up going down the wrong way of an 8 lane freeway adds to the films pleasures as does the use of locations around the city that you don't normally see - rail tracks,sidings,industrial landscapes and the L.A. river basin are all uses to terrific effect.It has a very '80's soundtrack by Wang Chung that fits the mood and location perfectly and its has a very bleak ending that Hollywood would have real issues with today.

With ""The Exorcist's"" William Friedkin directing- it is no small wonder why he can always instill a sense of dark foreboding, in this classic tale of vengeance, deception, and greed. Set in seedy Los Angeles, I must admit the well-choreographed car chase scenes are one of the most riveting I have ever seen.Seminal eighties' English pop group, Wang Chung's haunting, atmospheric, musical score is without doubt- far better than their mainstream radio efforts, and their finest work to date. Even by today's standards, it's just an excellent all-around soundtrack to be driving a fast car with.

""To Live and Die in LA"" is clearly awful, but at the time, we somehow missed how clunky, and terribly written it was. So many good actors are in it, and Billy Friedkin had a rep, but now this film looks more dated than a bad silent film. The faux style, and hyper-thin cast, speaks of that decade where sex, drugs, and rock and roll died. It is no wonder that Michael Mann sued, as the film has that ""Manhunter"" / ""Miami Vice"" high-art sweaty sheen to it, when we were too slick (or too high) to know we were lame. The dialog is laughable, but so too are the actors leaping, shooting, and doing stunts that seem as everyone might have been addled. Trust me, this is a terrible film, and the one great scene should be fast forwarded to, as you will wince at how ham-handed EVERY part of this work is. As I read the positive reviews here, I am reminded why the Internet is popular. Without taste or an aesthetic criteria, everybody has their say. I would argue that if you are not shocked by how horrible this film is, that you should not be trusted to review anything beyond fast-food. As a testament to the worst decade in art within my 50 years, ""To Live and Die in LA"" is wonderfly AWFUL.

138,ReggieSantori,Everybody Wang Chung Tonight!,1,28 April 2004,"Yes, that is Wang Chung on the soundtrack, and not just for the songs, but for the entire score! Why? William Friedkin, who once made us all respect him with THE FRENCH CONNECTION and THE EXORCIST must have thought it was time for a change and made this 80s monstrosity. He's thoroughly responsible for it, too. On his DVD commentary, he admits to writing much of the script, selecting William L. Petersen for the lead, and hiring Wang Chung, telling them ""not to do a piece with a beginning or an end"". The result is dreadful and uneven. The best thing about this movie is its car chase, and that can't hold a candle to the brilliant piece of work in THE FRENCH CONNECTION.	The movie starts off with an assassination attempt on the president, which is thwarted by secret service agent Petersen and his aging partner. His partner is retiring in a few days, but must go out on one last case. He goes after counterfeiter Masters (Willem Dafoe) and is promptly blown away by him, giving Petersen a revenge motive to take down Dafoe at any cost. That's the main plot. The details are that both the hero and the villain sleep with girls who don't like them, the hero has a new partner who's afraid of breaking the rules, and the villain has a lawyer who isn't too particular about them. For some reason, any mention of Petersen's connection to the secret service stops after the opening scene, and he seems to be an ordinary cop. John Turturro shows up somewhere in the mix as a man working for Masters, and is ultimately a forgettable side note. It's a funny thing that in a movie for which money was actually counterfeited under supervision of an ex-con, the funny money itself spends almost as little time in the movie as does the secret service. In Friedkin's own THE FRENCH CONNECTION, the heroine was also real, and an ever-present part of the story (who could forget the quality test scene?). I guess there's only one way to say it: Friedkin lost it.For some reason this movie has multiple scene including male nudity and people getting kicked in the crotch. This movie is a bit like a porno: you see every character naked but you never get to know who they really are. Likewise, TO LIVE AND DIE IN L.A., as a movie, is all surface. On top of that, the surface isn't very pleasing. The canned Wang Chung score, the lifeless photography, and the poor transitions add up to a movie that is as ugly as it is empty.A strange set of circumstances and the movie's only good twist send Petersen and his new partner, Pankow on a doomed mission to abduct a man carrying a vast sum of money, bringing gunmen down on them and resulting in the now famous car chase (Wang Chung fans beware, it's un-scored!). Here we finally get some interesting photography and the action the move had been sorely lacking. From there, the plot steers for tragedy and a conclusion that feel somewhat inevitable. This, however, is mishandled, giving the viewer yet another disappointment to remember it by. I won't spoil it, because it really isn't worth spoiling.This movie is nothing special. At best it's a flawed cop drama, at worst a stain on several careers. You can get what you're looking for better stronger, faster, and just plain not screwed up. See Friedkin's big movies from the 70s instead. TO LIVE AND DIE IN L.A. is a sad reminder that we can no longer count on him to deliver quality cinema.",To Live and Die in L.A.

There have been many a good ones produced over the years and some great ones. Director William Friedkin has a close bond to the genre, having made the legendary 'The French Connection"" back in 1971. In 1985 he returned to the genre with a bang!This is a great film and a very entertaining ride into to the more shady places of L. A. and its criminal underworld. I actually find this masterpiece a tad more entertaining and intriguing than 'TFC' (which I love). Partially due to the fact that I know more of the dark side of mankind that is drug dealing and its effect on people and communities than I know of the world of counterfit money.I remember seeing this upon the initial release back in 1985, and I was blown away with it. Just watching the title sequence with its beautiful use of color, innovative camera technique, the powerful soundtrack and the way the credits hit the screen made me think; wow! I knew from the start that I was in for a treat...Friedkin co-wrote this with Gerald Petievich. It´s a tight and solid script where there is no black or white. The good guys cross the line between right and wrong and behaves very shady and the bad guys shows the occasional glimpse of moral standpoint, albeit somewhat skewed.Friedkin´s direction is spot on and the cinematography is stunning. L. A. Has never looked more bright and sunny than in this film. The use of orange as THE city color, is an interesting one. Action sequences are exceptional - especially the car chase - and there is a stunning twist at the end.The music and score by ´80's band Wang Chung is an interesting take on a film score and fits very well in the film and narrative. And no, it hasn't aged. The acting is great/good/solid and every character seems perfectly cast. Look out for Willem Dafoe and John Turturro in early big parts. William Peterson I have always liked as an actor and here he truly shines. John Pankow is great as is Stockwell, Fluegel, Feuer and each and everybody else. Great casting!I cannot praise this one enough. A must see and a must own (look for the ARROW or MGM release on Blu-Ray). Great film and highly recommended (8/10)!Sorry, almost forgot... The film has got THAT ending...",To Live and Die in L.A.
141,blktoptrvl,Not what I thought it would be,5,3 January 2004,"This movie was long, but it had the extra advantage of being boring too.When ""To Live and Die in L.A."" first was released twenty years ago, it came with a lot of hype. It was supposed to be THE cop movie. It would change everyone's perception of what a cop drama should be.I wonder if I would have liked it more if I had seen it when it was originally released - in the context of the times - but watching it today, I couldn't accept it as anything more that a TV drama with a lot of swearing and nudity.The only burst excitement in the film comes in the chase scene which again I admit - might have been fresh 20 years ago - but has since be eclipsed by movies like ""Ronin"" and just about any other modern chase that goes against traffic.Willam Defoe did well with his character - he gave a good performance; but the character was one dimensional with no explanation for why he did anything he did.  I never understood why he was into the crimes he was. I never understood his girlfriend, or his lawyer's motivations were. If fact the only really interesting character was the partner played very well by John Pankow.All in all I have to say that this movies just doesn't stand up to time and is not worth the time.",To Live and Die in L.A.
142,jodyshealy,Purely fantastic,9,9 March 2020,"I don't think I can be critical of this movie, it's just pure 80s crime gold. Wonderful super loud synth track and wonderful acting. 80s noir? Maybe. Watch it.",To Live and Die in L.A.
143,Get_your_azz_to_Mars,"""You want bread, *beep* a baker.""",9,21 May 2014,"William Friedkin's 'To Live & Die in LA' is hands down one of the best cop movies ever made. It's as raw and hard-boiled as any gritty cop drama, including Friedkin's earlier 'The French Connection', and isn't bogged down with buddy-cop clichés that later burned out the genre by the early 1990s. William Petersen plays a secret service agent living on the edge, quite literally at times, as he takes extreme risks nearly every day on the job. When his partner is killed he tells his new partner, played by John Pankow, that he's going to get the murderer no matter what it takes. The killer is a counterfeiter named Masters (played by Willem Dafoe in a fine performance) who is also an artist. It's a curious twist that the killer commits crime in order to fund his art, which he routinely burns because he is perfectionist. He feels the same way about his other 'art': counterfeiting money.What I found most intriguing about Friedkin's film is its consistent avoidance of clichés. First off, Los Angeles looks ugly, industrial, and very inhospitable in this film. None of the conventional shots of fancy, upscale downtown or beautiful Long Beach. We also aren't given sentimental sob stories for Petersen's semi-suicidal behavior, nor are we given many 'buddy-buddy' moments between him and his new partner. The characters are revealed more by their actions than their words, which I think is more interesting. The two secret service agents are both professionals doing a job and oftentimes bending the rules (or outright breaking them) to get Masters. We aren't even treated to a true romance in the picture. Both Petersen and Masters have women they have sex with on the side, but neither of them seem to particularly love them and both use them for what they want (and likewise the women use them). The climax too, goes against convention in the handling of Petersen's character that many people still find rather shocking for a mainstream film. I, for one, found it both refreshing and daring to end it in such a manner.Finally, the score might be a tad dated by today's standards yet I enjoyed it and felt it added to the feeling of the film. Friedkin is famous for finding the right composers and music for his films (think Tangerine Dream for 'Sorcerer') and 'To Live & Die in LA' is no exception.For any out there who enjoys cop movies 'To Live & Die in LA' is a must see. Moreover, it truly belongs up there with Friedkin's other masterpieces like 'The Exorcist' and 'The French Connection'. It's a shame the film was a box office dud or we may have seen further Friedkin explorations of the down and dirty world of police work like we did in 'The French Connection' and 'To Live & Die in LA'.",To Live and Die in L.A.
144,ThingyBlahBlah3,a litmus test - possible spoilers,9,23 August 2004,"David Mamet once explained the difference between art and entertainment. Entertainment, he said, reinforces what you already know, and tells you that you're right. Art, on the other hand, suggests that what you know is wrong, and that your beliefs might not be correct.In ""To Live and Die in L.A."", director William Friedkin inverts, twists, and eventually demolishes the standard ""Cop seeks vengeance for his partner's murder (with 3 days til retirement!)"" formula. The viewer learns that 1) not every law enforcement agent always has the public good in mind, 2) real people generally aren't either 'good' or 'evil' all the time, 3) if a cop (or in this case, Secret Service agent) takes the law into his own hands, he WILL pay for it one way or another, and 4) whether you're a cop or a criminal, things usually don't go according to plan.This information is directly opposed to what we've learned from countless action movies of the 1980s. Watching the ""Lethal Weapon"" movies, or anything with Schwarznegger, Stallone or Seagal, suggests that it's fun and entertaining when cops take the law into their own hands. Notice that no matter how much damage Riggs & Murtaugh cause, they can laugh about it with the captain later, and the world is always a better place for it. And no matter how many people's civil rights are trampled, and no matter how illegal the cops' activities are, everything always works out in the end, and the only people who get hurt are the ""bad"" people.""To Live and Die in L.A."" shows what would happen if Riggs & Murtaugh tried their antics in the real world. While Martin Riggs' arrogant recklessness is heroic and hilarious, Richard Chance's arrogant recklessness ruins a lot of lives, not least his own. When it's over, justice has hardly been served, and even though the bad guys are dead, there's no hint that L.A. is a better place for it.With all these ""Lethal Weapon"" comparisons, I should make it clear that ""To Live and Die in L.A."" came out in 1985, two years before the first LW movie.All that stuff aside, this is one rock-solid movie. Willem Dafoe uses his character's eccentricities to create (for my money) one of the best villains in cinematic history, even if the movie doesn't see Rick Masters quite that way. William Peterson is incredible and brings a lot of depth to his performance; I'm not one to critique someone else's opinion, but I don't understand the users who complained that he's ""wooden."" Chance is an egomaniacal, scheming nutjob with a death wish; he really believes that he's above life and death, and it never crosses his mind that he might be wrong. Peterson brings this all out.Dean Stockwell is in his element, playing a scumbag who knows everything about everyone. John Pankow was a wonderful surprise, bringing all sorts of conflicting and confused ideas to Vukovich, which is perfectly appropriate. When things really go wrong, he goes to pieces. Again, some users complained that he was overacting, but ask yourself how YOU'D behave. Nobody ever gives Darlanne Fleugel much credit, but she's terrific here. There's a whole lot going on in Ruth's head, and in many ways, she's the central character to this whole play. Pay attention. And I'd be remiss in my duties if I didn't point out Steve James and Jack Hoar as two of Masters' criminal associates. They're both tough, intimidating, and surprisingly multi-dimensional.And I haven't even mentioned 1) the car chase to end all car chases, 2) the copious amount of nudity, 3) the perfect fit of Wang Chung's soundtrack with the day-glo L.A. look, even as all hell breaks loose and men confront the dark depths of their souls (huh?), and 4) a climactic shock that WILL knock you for a loop.",To Live and Die in L.A.
145,la_follette,Brutal and unforgettable,9,6 August 2017,"Although now 32 years old, this film still packs a wallop. The violence is raw, and very brutal -- even by today's standards. Everyone seems to be getting shot in the face, or in the testicles, and director Friedkin always makes sure to show the gore in full, red detail. The story concerns a corrupt Secret Service agent named Chance out to avenge his partner's killing. He runs into a vicious artist-counterfeiter named Masters who seems to know all of Chance's moves before anyone else. Someone is feeding Masters information, and the film suggests it could be a sleazy lawyer, appropriately named Grimes, or the sleazy woman who Chance is sleeping with. We really don't know though.Mirroring the violence is an equally ugly depiction of Los Angeles. Forget about palm trees, beaches and glamorous people. Friedkin's Los Angeles consists of smog, railroad yards, electrical towers, claustrophobic industrial streets and seedy bars. There's literally nothing redeeming about the place.There are some apparent plot holes. Why don't they just arrest Masters? They know where he is, as he frequents a local health club (""I'm an easy man to find"" he boasts). Masters had rented out an industrial warehouse where Chance's partner was killed. Masters drove his sports car and walked all over that property. Was he so careful that he scrubbed every piece of evidence? I would imagine something was left behind -- a tire track, a footprint, something. Either from Masters or his burly co- conspirator. Stupidly, when the Secret Service shows up at the warehouse, they put their fingerprints on every door and dumpster handle in sight.Instead of arresting him, they try a sting operation. It doesn't go well.The dialogue is cynical, dark and very true to life. Certain lines stick with you. ""Makin it like very other swinging dick in here."" ""Enjoy your work Mr. Jessup?"" ""He doesn't have it. What a guy."" ""Your taste is in your ass.""Nine out of 10.",To Live and Die in L.A.

147,Arthur_Desmond,A festivity of moral decay,9,6 October 2006,"This is a flawed movie, but with an appeal transcending the obvious quality of its actors and the proficiency shown in most of its scenes; actually, its true flaws, namely its dated soundtrack and its 80s ""cool"" macho dialogs and mannerisms, may even play in its favor looking at the whole in perspective. And, as happens with violence or sex in movies by Takashi Miike, for instance, this surface probably serves as a screen protecting the viewer from a far darker underbelly.Specifically, the quality that sets this film beyond all others of its kind (and by the way makes Michael Mann's suit so inadequate) and makes it so admirable, is its total lack of hope in the existence of a moral grounding. Beyond the obvious, on-your-face nihilism present in the ending, there is also a subtle undercurrent of deep cynicism all through the movie, as if Friedkin had to make it clear to us, both at a conscious and at a subconscious level, that he simply has no hope neither for the characters he describes nor for the very archetypes they represent. This is no hipster cynicism à la Tarantino we're speaking about; this is something very genuine and very fundamental, as if the filmmakers responsible for this had lost all possible hope in justice, good will and redemption. Every single human being depicted in some detail in this movie is selfish, unbalanced, ruthless and at times (as is the case of Chance) even self-destructive. Every action performed here is led by self-interest, greed and even psychotic pulsions and, most interestingly, the latter are not only present in the villain: they are also present in the hero. Indeed, Petersen and Friedkin have managed to coin a new form of antihero, endowing him with a total lack of regard of ethical AND moral values and actually making him no better than the villain he pursues. He blackmails a girl on parole in exchange for information and occasional sexual relief, irresponsibly throws his own partner into the same near-suicidal car-chase he is in, shows no other feelings for the FBI agent killed much to his own fault than the fear of being caught, and makes it clear from the beginning that he is not intending to arrest Masters, no matter how many ethical and even legal barriers he has to trespass. And yet, surprisingly, there is something special in him or in the whole ambiance that makes us still wish for his success, even if we probably have more objective reasons to sympathize with Masters than we have to root for him. The central car chase and the feelings it arouses on the viewer exemplify this in a diaphanous manner. And, keeping with the bleak tone of the whole film, Chance's untimely death is anything but epic; in an unusual display of realism, Friedkin disposes of his hero in a brutal and at the same time casual manner, like an animal run over by a car in the highway-- there is no climactic prelude to his death and there is no token moral epilogue to his uglily ordinary death: he was simply slower than the shooter, as may happen in real life.An intelligent movie, indeed. No wonder why it has become a cult classic over the years... and no wonder why it was not a box-office hit when it first came out.",To Live and Die in L.A.

(3) Any better info on the exact locations of filming ? One of my personal Top 10 without a doubt - just such a completely different take on the cop film.

I just picked up and watched 'To Live And Die In L.A.' on DVD and had my socks knocked off for the umpteenth time!... Those expecting a standard, cookie cutter 'Cops & Robbers' film should go elsewhere. Friedken pulled out all the stops on this one! Taking a small budget and a clutch of then No-Name actors. Planting them in the sections of L.A. no one ever sees. And allowed them free rein to improvise, romp and play. And then, create some of their best work!.. William Petersen plays Secret Service Agent Rick Chance. Who hunts Artists/Conterfeiter/Con, Eric Masters. Played with clever, evil glee by Willem Dafoe, with a passion just short of Psychosis... The segments showing Dafoe making 'Funny Money' are as detailed and astounding as the scenes of him violently tidying up loose ends!... Toss in great location shots. A few startling chases. And a 'conscience' for Petersen, played by John Pankow as John Vukovich. A three-piece, by-the-book agent.

The good guys have serious flaws and insecurities; the bad guys do too (if there are good and bad guys, the line is so blurred it's hardly there). Given the situation, it's all entirely appropriate -hence the quote:""Why are you chasin' me ?""""Why you running ?""""Because you're chasin' me, man!""Apart from that, this film also contains one of the best car-chases since ""Bullit"" - it really emphasises the out-of-control nature of the whole film.",To Live and Die in L.A.

I have to say, it's among the worst movies I've ever seen, and I've seen a huge number of movies in my long life.

The film, making masterful use of gritty LA backdrops and Wang Chung soundtrack, drips with the atmosphere of cheesy 80s LA in a way that no other film quite matches.To Live and Die in LA is one of the very few films in my experience that transcends its source book, as the characters really come alive vs. the book.

Several critics have noted the complete lack of sympathetic characters (and I take that to mean in the broadest sense of the word, ""sympathetic""), but I wouldn't see this as a crippling flaw in the film so much as is the pedestrian directing, shooting, and editing (again, compared to Friedkin's best). The film's plot is also quite overheated, almost to the point of parody, especially as the ends of Chance's ""plan"" begin to quickly unravel.Overall, quite a letdown.

Thta's not a bad thing because back then every second action thriller starred Stallion, Schwartzenposer, Van Dammed, Segull, etc (sic)...Instead we get real actors for this one.Second difference is that this is not a flag waving good guys vs bad guys, good guys win plot.  No in this one there is a pretty fine line between good and bad with plenty of crossover.  And you start to get that unusual feeling (that you don't often get with US films) of uncertainty as to who will come out on top.Third difference is that the characters are flawed.  They make mistakes. Serious ones.  Pretty much every character in the film screws up in some way.  Think 52 pickup or ransome, only with most of the mistakes perpretated by the good guys.  It's not because they are clumsy, just that they are human.  This makes the viewer empathise with them.Fourth difference, the good guys do one very big no-no.  You'll see what I mean.Fifth difference, this comes about 15mins from the end.  You'll know it when you see it.  You'll think - no, surely that was the other guy.  It's fast and sudden, and you are in disbelief for most of the rest of the film... ...that sixth difference goes on another 10 mins after you think it should have ended.If you like Arnie films then you won't like this.  That's probably why it din't do so wll back then.  It's doing a lot better now.
I rate it the finest cop type thriller of it's day.  It has more in common with James Ellroy that Jerry Brickhammer (sic).Oh - and the directionis excellent.  I give it a 10, and that's on effort alone!

159,Flash19,misunderstood underrated cult classic MAJOR SPOILERS,10,23 October 2003,"You must take into account that this film was released in 1985, the same era as Miami Vice, but pre Lethal Weapon.  This makes it all the more remarkable and far sighted.First off at the time the film was made none of the actors were well known stars.The Chance character fanices himself.  In the foot chase scene he falls over, doesn't quite pull it off.  In one fight scene the bad guy beats him up.  This isn't supposed to happen!  Exactly.  He's meant to look like a poseur.  He's selfish, loves himself, and has little concept of reality.Chance lays it on the line to a judge that he must have a prisoner released into his custody.  The judge doesn't agree with him so Chance throws a spoiled brat tantrum.  The judge relents, and Chances manages to screw up when his prisoner beats him up and absconds...  Chance is not just fallible but downright clumsy and despite all this very very arrogant.When Chance breaks the rules Vulkovich objects but is too weak willed to put his foot down.  The rule breaking always blows up in their faces.  Chance never considers the impact on Vulkovich, he's almost sociopathic in his attitude to other people.  Vulkovich follows Chance around like a little lost dog.Chance needs $30K to strike an undercover deal with Masters who killed his partner.  The Secret Service has a rule that it will only front $10K.  So what does Chance do?  Break the rules and steal it from another crook.  So he talks Vulcovich into kidnapping a diamond smuggler thats carrying cash for a diamond buy.SPOILER ALERTThe diamond smuggler gets shot accidentally, and the Secret Service guys find themselves being chased in their car.  They can't stop the car and say ""Hey we're the Secret Service you can't chase us"" because they just stole $50K for someone and now he's dead.  Vulkovich is virtually crying he's so scared.Next day they find out the dead guy was an undercover FBI agent working a sting operation...   Oops.But this doesn't phase the ever selfish Chance (after all it wasn't him that shot the FBI guy and how was he to know), so he goes ahead and makes the deal.The criminals view the Secret Service guys as low calibre.  Their attempts at undercover work are hurried and excuted in a hamfisted manner.
MAJOR SPOILER ALERTJust when you thought things were heading waaay leftwards the bigget shock comes along.  Chance isn't content with just apprehending the villan, no he wants to do it personally (just like on Miami Vice), so he screw things up by insisting that he personally cuff Masters, Vulkovich of course being as streetwise as a blind rabbit takes time out to spectate.  Out of nowhere with no warning or build up, Chance gets his head blown off with a good 20mins left to run.So this is essentially the story of a guy who wants to be in Miami Vice but finds out that those tactics don't work in the real world, gets killed, and the world goes on without batting an eyelid.  Surprise!Brilliant.Meanwhile Vulkovich doesn't get any of this and decides to remodel himself as the new Chance, even resplendant in cheaper leather jacket with - you guessed it - the sleeves rolled up.If you are sick off glossy cop thrillers with poseur infallible heroes and not only want reality but also come uppance, whilst enjoying a very thrilling and well made film then this is definately for you.

If you like 80s cheese there's plenty of it. The credits are in florescent greens and four plus Wang Chung tracks are mixed VERY LOUD. We all knew Wang Chung sucked even in the 80s and I even like that genre. It's Miami Vice in L.A. and Chance even breaks out his best Crockett duds to meet with Masters. I also found the chase scene boring. What I liked: 1. Chance getting his head blown off. THANK YOU 2. Some uncommon L.A. ugliness is captured. Not the typical shots. 3.

I don't see why this is so beloved by film fans.I see labels like ""groundbreaking"", ""cliche free"", ""gritty"", ""a different take on ___"". It's NONE of those things! It's full of some of the biggest cop clichés of all time - and I know for a fact they didn't stem from this film. For example, 10 minutes in, one of the cops says ""I'm too old for this s**t"" - then he gets shot TWO DAYS FROM RETIREMENT! I almost fell out of my chair laughing at how ludicrous it was. It was like a parody of a cop film.Then there's the whole ""the brooding cop doesn't want a new partner, but is forced to get along with him anyway"". The lead isn't an anti-hero cop, he's just incompetent. He and his partner fall asleep at a stake out! He lets the guy he has in custody go see a ""daughter"" in hospital, not even checking with the hospital if she's related and knows the guy. Then he lets the criminal get away by taking his cuffs off in a hospital lift, and then getting the crap kicked out of him. RIDICULOUS!I know this film is from the '80s, but this is beyond your average '80s campy cheese factor. Numerous posing with one leg on a chair, with crotch in full view - tight jeans begging for mercy. Naked/half naked guys everywhere. It's not a big deal, it was just kind of laughable when all these guys are being macho with each other... then they're naked in a dressing room together, going about their business. The terrible soundtrack doesn't help. The main guy tries to act tough, but just comes off looking like a tool. Who wears a leather jacket without a shirt underneath? Plus, the main character is called Dick Chance. Yeah.The directing is hit and miss. Sometimes there's interesting shots, or techniques - I particularly liked the POV shot when the main guy is chasing after a criminal. The majority of the time though, the film has abrupt cuts which are jarring, but it not in an artistic, or meaningful way. It's just annoying, and feels like an amateur is behind the camera.It took three days for me to watch all of it. It was painfully bad. The only saving grace was the great acting from Dafoe and Turturro, but even they couldn't save this mess. Sorry for the long-winded post, but I felt passionate about this and want to make sure if anyone is on the fence about this - please, AVOID! If you want to watch a decent anti-hero cop film, I'd suggest watching Bad Lieutenant [1992], which is what I watched after this to cleanse myself after watching the prior trash. Bad Lieutenant does everything that this film wanted to do, but did it right - and went balls to the wall with it.",To Live and Die in L.A.

I remember being shocked when William Peterson's character is killed toward the end. That car chase? Boy, hot stuff! Peterson's character Chance, edgy dude! DaFoe's Master's; cool villain! The lesbian undertones really got my pulse racing...I really used to think that this was a good film, but I'm all better now. Where to begin with what is wrong with this movie? OK, hackneyed plot device: Chance's partner has three days left before retirement, will he pick up his pension? Hey, what about that name: Chance, 'cause he takes risks! Sooo existential. Hmmm...The crooks chasing Chance and Vukovich after they kidnap (unwittingly) the FBI man just happen to pull up at the point on the bridge above exactly where they are, good guess guys! That ******* score!! One of the worst scores ever? Cast your vote now! It often has no relevance to what it is underscoring, like an uninvited guest. There are myriad other things wrong, but I wanted to say something a little positive. Robby Muller's cinematography captures an L.A. that could have equalled the almost noirish city presence that Michael Mann achieves in Heat. Yet William Friedkin manages to squander his talents. Is this the same man who used Owen Roizman to show us the seedy underbelly of New York and the horror behind the bourgeois facade of Georgetown? (Not to mention the unforgettable opening Iraq sequence in The Exorcist, shot by Billy Williams, one of the greatest opening acts in film, I would argue.) If, like myself you liked this film when you first saw it, I would recommend that you never view it again and hold to those fond and distant memories. It must be said, however, that it wasn't a completely unenjoyable experience. My wife and I had a fine time pulling it to bits and laughing at the inept dialogue. Unfortunately, she still thinks that my taste in movies sucks.",To Live and Die in L.A.
163,gilnerjohn40,Not what most might expect,9,18 March 2014,"By the end of the film, I thought it was a cheesy clichéd 80s crime thriller. But then I realized all of the films that I was comparing it to, copied off of this film. This film set the bar for the 80s crime thriller, and the crime thriller in general. Of course, it is undeniably 80s. Wang Chung provided the soundtrack. However, Friedken does not disappoint with his chase scenes. Chase scenes that some films today can't even hold a candle to. What adrenaline, there are not many films that can get your heart beating as fast as this one can. William Peterson gives a truly dynamite performance. But, personally, I believe Willem Dafoe stole the show. Nobody does the criminal like he does. Jesus Christ, he was so evil! This is a film that would not let me look away. I really was mesmerized by it. Friedken, thanks to the French Connection and this Film, is officially the king of the chase. What a wild ride, definitely worth a view.",To Live and Die in L.A.
164,DannyNoonan68,Everybody Wang Chung Tonight! ...Or not.,8,12 June 2014,"A lot of people (the great Roger Ebert included) would have you believe that To Live and Die in L.A. is a stunning, suspenseful thriller beautifully shot and directed by William Friedkin. I know that the eighties were a lean time for quality cinema, but the pumping Wang Chung soundtrack and William Peterson's appalling acting annihilates any tension that may have been attempted in pretty much any given scene.Oh. And when I say ""Wang Chung soundtrack"" I don't mean a handful of tastefully or cleverly placed songs, like say, The Graduate, Harold and Maude or Magnolia. I mean SOUNDTRACK. Not just the appalling songs distastefully and carelessly strewn in the background, but weird techno-synth monstrosities attempting to build the tension of action scenes or underscore quiet moments.When someone says that this film is a ""lost treasure""... and a lot of people do... It only makes sense if they are referring to it as one of the great lost comedies of the eighties. I still regularly, randomly will laugh out load thinking about one particularly Wang Chung heavy chase sequence in that movie and a couple of ludicrously overwrought faces that William Peterson makes with his ""acting"".Five Stars.......Out of Ten",To Live and Die in L.A.
165,faffaflunkie,Plain Busted,2,24 August 2018,"I see the same reviews over and over again- that damn ""To Live and Die in LA"" (sic) as an ""80's Movie"".Well is ""The French Connection""- which is set in 1963- a ""60's Movie""? Was Friedkin's ""Cruising"" which show gays popping poppers in a pre-AIDS world a ""70's movie""?For that matter if you order french-fries does the make you ""French""? If you order a Polish sausage does that somehow turn you into a Polak? Well it might if you order one in a Laundro-mat.That's about how I feel about this movie.Meet special agent Richard Chance (William Petersen) who apparently joined ""The Service"" for the same reason that Euro trash are joining ISIS- for the rush.Now like all of William Friedkin's movies there are multitudes of interesting shots- from the endless refineries of the Harbor Gateway to tough-looking street agents in their cluttered vestibules and walking, guns bulging from underneath leather jackets, through labyrinths of tunnels under the Federal Building- something the public just doesn't get to see.As you get from the other reviews the lynchpin- and the major selling point- of ""To Live and Die in LA"" is an apocryphal car chase through the streets of Los Angeles that causes a major traffic tie-up.But before the big chase it really should be apparent that Agent Chance (Petersen) has gone from mad-man on a mission to looney psychopath when he is told that he can't take down a ""Chinaman"" (remember that this is still the '80's) who will be carrying $50,000 dollars- it's the '80's you know and that was a lot of money then. Agent Chance, a lawman trusted to protect the president- then tells his informant that he can do anything he wants.But like flipping a light switch- almost like the director had watched too many Eddie Murphy movies- the characters turn not just likeable- but downright cute.Not to get too graphic but the movie shows gunshot wounds that look like they are out of a medical textbook. You can Google "".357 magnum suicide"" and pretty much get the drift of the end of the movie.But wait! Google ""Alternate Ending"" of this movie- and you will see that ""To Live and Die in LA"" really could have been an ""80's"" film- Ferris Bueller's day off with a green eye shade- as a counterfeiter?",To Live and Die in L.A.
166,aroid,Paint ball by the numbers,5,7 November 2006,"It doesn't bother me that none of the cops are good guys, what do you think? This is LA, land of endless police corruption investigations, even tho they are feds and are supposed to know better. What bothered me most about this was the paint ball special effects in all the killings. Immediately people get their faces, chests, covered with great, overly red blobs of gooey red paint. It doesn't even look like blood, and it is released instantly upon being shot. This has to have the worst blood of any movie ever made. The undercover girl seemed way to glamorous and passive, at the same time the whole plot of her somehow remaining above suspicion while hanging out with the brilliant Dafoe character didn't make any sense.I just don't buy the argument, ""We're Europeans, we love offtrack stars, diffuse, relativistic story lines."" This is a borderline B movie, let's face it. And move on to some other movies without red paint ball special effects. And another thing, The Exorcist was not a very good movie. It was of a similar nearly B movie grade effort as this one. Rosemary's Baby, now that is an A movie of a not dissimilar genre and sits way above anything Friedkin has ever done. No one is mentioning his remake of Wages of Sin, which is also not very good, and has a similar disconnected quality to his other movies.",To Live and Die in L.A.

Great performances also by the rest of the cast (John Pankow as a Fed agent trying to stay straight, and his partner, Wm Peterson as John Vukovitch who tries to corrupt him in a vengeance-fuelled drive to get Masters, a cop-killer whose killings have infuriated Vukovitch.

168,DC Flim,Great action thriller is too underrated,9,1 April 1999,"I can't believe that this film is not in print anymore, as is the novel it was based on. (The soundtrack was easy to find, ironically; I got it exactly a week before I saw the movie).The story is pretty simple: Cop tries to avenge partners death, yada, yada, yada. But Richard Chance (William Petersen) is no ordinary cop, and his nemisis Rick Masters (Willem DeFoe) is no common crook.With ""French Connection"" director William Friedkin at the helm, LA has never looked better on film, and the car chase is (almost) equal to the NYC El Train sequence in that movie. The acting is above par, with Petersen showing more depth in one movie then most ""action heroes"" show in five. And wrap it all up in Bud Smith's editing and Wang Chungs music, and you've got yourself one of the best action films ever made.",To Live and Die in L.A.

Bad good-guys and even badder bad-guys this movie keeps you wondering how it's going to end. William Peterson and Willem Dafoe give great performances. My only complaint?

170,ally-23,Outstanding!,9,22 January 2002,"What an underrated movie!  William Friedkin does it again with this gritty cop drama............this one is right up there with the Exorcist, the French Connection, and the French Connection II.  No offense to the great car chase sequences in the French Connection and Bullit, but the car chase shot in this movie is truly unbelievable.  I don't have any idea how Friedkin shot or choreographed that wonderful sequence.  For fans of the two French Connections; a must see.  William Petersen is great as the leading man, but his wonderful performance is even overshadowed by the great performance by Willem Dafoe as the bad guy counterfeiter.  The movie also has fine performances by John turturro and John Pankow.  A truly great movie........great soundtrack.  Highly recommended.",To Live and Die in L.A.
171,gortry,Kudos and a Caveat,8,7 June 2009,"A fine film, exuding artistry at all levels and in all departments, but especially in Friedkin's own. The liberal review establishment didn't find the usual counterfeit uplift in the usual places (love, service and family) and so they turned on Friedkin like the proverbial swine amid the pearls. Well, the pearl has kept its lustre but the swine have been turned to tripe. Uplift is irrelevant next to transcendence. My one caveat is with the storyline. It concerns the question of Master's knowledge of the undercover agents' identities. In the final colloquy between Masters and Vukovich, it is made clear that Masters knows (by way of his lawyer) that Vukovich is an agent who wouldn't ""roll over"" on his partner Chance. The inference seems to be that Masters went ahead with the illicit deal with this knowledge, something that staggers belief! All indications prior to this scene lead us to believe that Masters suspects the two buyers are not who they say they are but are nonetheless trustworthy customers, i.e., people with a shared criminal intent. Masters' comment to Vukovich seems inexplicable and could have been omitted without any loss to the narrative. Friedkin, it appears, was hoping to twist his plot for the sake of noiresque complexity, while overlooking the violence he was doing to its credibility.",To Live and Die in L.A.
172,htech,Great chase... but not the only reason to see this film,7,4 February 1999,"Everyone comments on the chase, and of course, it is a technically and artistically thrilling sequence, probably the second best on film after the scene in Bullitt.The best part of this film, however, is the character study of the Secret Service agent played by William L. Peterson.  He's right on track as the macho, Chicago-accented agent who has an unhealthy single-minded obsession with bringing down master counterfeiter Willem Dafoe.  Peterson's determination only intensifies after his partner is murdered.You get to see John Pankow as the straight-laced agent who becomes Peterson's new partner and watch as he struggles with the moral and legal dilemmas inherent in law enforcement.  He is repulsed by Peterson's vigilante tactics, but is reluctantly drawn in to the chaos.Some relegate this film to late-night, B-movie status.  After all, it was scored by Wang Chung!!!   But, the movie is more than it seems.  It's solidly acted, well paced and very interesting to look at.Some notables:  The behind the scenes look at counterfeiting is fascinating! Imagine what could be done today with the advances in computer and printer technology.  Also, look for Jane Leeves (TV Frasier's Daphne) in a non-speaking role as the girl-toy for Willem Dafoe and his girlfriend.",To Live and Die in L.A.

It is beautifully shot (for its time) and indeed the story has enough twists and turns to make it somewhat interesting. But, hoo-boy, the acting and dialogue are laughable. Maybe it's because audiences today are more sophisticated and (former) upstarts like Tarantino breathed new life into gritty crime dramas, but this movie just doesn't hold up as far as dialogue realism goes. And I was going to buy some of this movie's scenery at the set-dec sale, but it was covered in bite-marks.Also, note to aspiring actors: wearing cowboy boots makes you walk and run funny.

174,mardri,Throroughly enjoyable and still current!,10,11 December 2005,"Although I'm neither a fan nor an expert regarding the genre of thrillers and chase movies -- and although I have never even seen ""The French Connection"" (!) -- I have seen ""To Live and Die in L.A."" five times since I bought the DVD a few weeks ago. I AM a fan of TV's CSI, and I allowed an actor friend to interest me in the early films of William L. Petersen. I was very intrigued by two completely disparate portrayals from the same actor: flying, exuberant, profane youth and quirky, nerdy, introspective middle age. Both characters are exasperating, driven, secretive, single-minded and completely like-able in their unlike-ability. That is, I don't WANT to like either one but am somehow forced to anyway and they both keep me riveted. Also, this 1985 film is still up-to-date and, though it is dated in some details such as the styles of the cars, the design of the 20-dollar bills and some of the slang expressions in the dialogue, the music, the quality of the directing and numerous scenes and situations are still current and even push the edge. May I mention there is even a suicide bomber?Could the ""R"" rating have kept this movie from being a big hit in its time? I hope that, now that William Petersen, Willem Dafoe and John Turturro are much better known, this jewel will become a cult classic, if it isn't already. William Friedkin deserves a lot of belated recognition for his work here.",To Live and Die in L.A.
175,TheMechanic11,My favorite movie!,10,27 May 2008,"I've seen my DVD about 9 or 10 times already, and I've never gotten tried of it--it's THAT great! At first, I thought ""To Live and Die in L.A."" was just the name of a Tupac Shakur song--I had no idea it was the name of an actual movie. But besides having a sick car chase (I LOVE car chases!) and Willem Dafoe (who I'd see in anything), my main motivation for buying the movie on Amazon back in April, was my all-time favorite TV show, ""Miami Vice"". In fact, the show's executive producer, Michael Mann, sued William Friedkin for plagiarism (Mann lost, but they're good friends now). The similarities are there, but the movie is far grittier and darker than the series could have ever been. As far as morals go, there are literally no good characters in this movie. Everyone's either an antagonist or an anti-hero. The ending was genius--in fact, it probably could have set the stage for a sequel, but looking back, it was a wise decision not to (I should also note that on the DVD, there's an alternate ending which was also wisely jettisoned, because it was horrible). The score by Wang Chung (yeah, THAT Wang Chung) is amazing, and so is the always fun Willem Dafoe, setting the stage for the villainous typecasting he'd have for much of his career. But the biggest surprise I got out of TLADILA, was the new-found respect I have for William Peterson. It never dawned on me on how cool he was. In fact, it's kind of painful to see him go from a character like Richard Chance--a reckless a-hole with nothing really to live for, but is so ultra-cool, you gotta love him--to doing....C.S.I. He really should have been a box-office star! ""To Live and Die in L.A."" is a remarkably intense and stylish thriller, from a decade I wish I was a part of (technically, I was, because I was born in 82', but I was a kid--too young to even remember how cool the 80's were). That's why it's my favorite movie!",To Live and Die in L.A.
176,jansundstedt,Classic Friedkin!,8,2 November 2021,"Police thrillers and action flicks are two of the most common and used genres in the movie industry. There have been many a good ones produced over the years and some great ones. Director William Friedkin has a close bond to the genre, having made the legendary 'The French Connection"" back in 1971. In 1985 he returned to the genre with a bang!This is a great film and a very entertaining ride into to the more shady places of L. A. and its criminal underworld. I actually find this masterpiece a tad more entertaining and intriguing than 'TFC' (which I love). Partially due to the fact that I know more of the dark side of mankind that is drug dealing and its effect on people and communities than I know of the world of counterfit money.I remember seeing this upon the initial release back in 1985, and I was blown away with it. Just watching the title sequence with its beautiful use of color, innovative camera technique, the powerful soundtrack and the way the credits hit the screen made me think; wow! I knew from the start that I was in for a treat...Friedkin co-wrote this with Gerald Petievich. It´s a tight and solid script where there is no black or white. The good guys cross the line between right and wrong and behaves very shady and the bad guys shows the occasional glimpse of moral standpoint, albeit somewhat skewed.Friedkin´s direction is spot on and the cinematography is stunning. L. A. Has never looked more bright and sunny than in this film. The use of orange as THE city color, is an interesting one. Action sequences are exceptional - especially the car chase - and there is a stunning twist at the end.The music and score by ´80's band Wang Chung is an interesting take on a film score and fits very well in the film and narrative. And no, it hasn't aged. The acting is great/good/solid and every character seems perfectly cast. Look out for Willem Dafoe and John Turturro in early big parts. William Peterson I have always liked as an actor and here he truly shines. John Pankow is great as is Stockwell, Fluegel, Feuer and each and everybody else. Great casting!I cannot praise this one enough. A must see and a must own (look for the ARROW or MGM release on Blu-Ray). Great film and highly recommended (8/10)!Sorry, almost forgot... The film has got THAT ending...",To Live and Die in L.A.
177,thelivingguano,Altered states,5,30 March 2006,"I have only seen this film once, during a period of my life beset by heavy use of various hallucinogens. As a result I was very into David Lynch, Donald Cammel etc and watched a lot of their films at the time while in some kind of ""enhanced"" state. I am still undecided if this made the experience better, since repeat viewings of ""Fire Walk with Me"" while sober have not been any less weird/wired.""To live and die"" however, I saw whilst having a clean-out and therefore in a state of complete sobriety. And that's the damnedest thing of it. It made absolutely no sense to me at all. None.The characters seemed to be almost Artaudian, with no fixed character traits; Chance ricocheted between ""hard cop"" and shrieking maniac. Plot threads appeared from nowhere only to disappear and never be seen again. And the final shot of the truck driving into the fence? Where did that truck come from? I didn't remember seeing it at all. The only thing which really stood out to me was during the silhouetted ""sex scene"" near the end, where the gentleman's flaccid manhood was clearly visible.I have since been informed by reliable and very cultured friends and acquaintances that this is a very high-calibre film and makes complete sense, and in fact the truck at the end had been seen before.

The grittiness of New York City vs. the romanticism of Los Angeles. Whereas French Connection was grounded in a realistic cop setting, To Live and Die in L.A. took a more different approach, akin to that of Dirty Harry. And it sure paid off.Both movies dealt with familiar themes but I feel Friedkin made something really memorable when it came to ""To Live and Die in L.A."". The colours, atmosphere, music and above all the acting encapsulated what a cop movie could be. Willem Dafoe, John Pankow, William Petersen did a great job in realising their characters; while Wang Chung's music plastered throughout is a top soundtrack.It is this reason you should watch it, and not miss the counterfeit world of L.A. - money, relationships and the city.",To Live and Die in L.A.
179,Toro-4,Outstanding,10,1 November 1998,"This is my favourite movie; when it was originally released I went to see it twice. Gerald Petievich wrote the book, and it has a Hemingway feel to it, gritty and to the point. Friedkin has done the same, and the result is a very powerful movie. Both Petersen and Dafoe play strong leading characters, and both are completely committed to their respective trades. Unlike some other crime movies I found Petersen believable as a tough guy not to be messed with. The supporting cast are also very strong; Pankow as the unsure partner, Stockwell as the oily lawyer. Feuer oozes natural  sexuality as the informant. The cinematography has a kind of choppy feel to it, with very few long takes, and also has a gritty feel, as Friedkin exposes the underbelly of LA. Even in the establishing shots you can imagine the heat and dirt. There is a lot of action in this movie and the plot keeps you wondering right up until the end.

The direction and cinematography were great (of course, it's William Friedkin, after all), especially in the film's opening sequence.

182,benvarkentine,I wonder why we waste our lives here...When we could run away to paradise,7,7 September 2007,"So I'm thinking about To Live And Die In LA.A couple IMDb users describe it as having been ""shamefully misunderstood"" by critics of the time. I dunno, maybe it was (I was paying more attention to Back To The Future and Cocoon that year). I know Roger Ebert liked it a lot, though.What did I think? I think this is a film with no heroes, just a protagonist. My rule of thumb has always been that whoever ends up changed the most by the events of a story is its protagonist.The biggest twist in this movie is that the person who you think that is for the first 106 minutes or so turns out not to be, and that's all I'll say for those of you who haven't seen it, which you probably should.In bare bones, this is about a cop (William L. Petersen) whose partner is killed and who decides that the son-of-a-bitch responsible (Willem Dafoe) must pay.The film has more mean twists to it than this suggests, unfortunately, it also has some big, stupid logic holes.But anyway, those bare bones aren't really what the piece is about. What it's ""really"" about, first of all, is a man who lowers himself into hell and finds that he likes it there.Visually it's a beautifully composed and shot film (directed by William Friedkin, photography by Robby Muller) with a great sense of place and time; almost worth seeing for those elements alone.Some of the dialog, unfortunately, is brutal: ""I'm gonna bag Masters, and I don't give a @%&% how I do it."" Which is why more than any movie except Legend and Star Wars: Episode I, this one might be just as well enjoyed if the DVD had a music-only audio track.Even though none of the film music is as good as the title song. I'm always up for a little Wang Chung tonight, but this is the most dated part of the film.That title song remains perfect, however.Especially when you realize that the lyrics make the most sense if thought of not from the point of view of one of the ""stars,"" as you might think, but someone who appears sixth in the credits. I'll get back to that in a moment.You see, what I think this movie is about, secondarily, is not just the hatred of women, but the rejection of any ""womanly"" qualities (like vulnerability).Dafoe's character, ostensibly the ""bad guy"" of the piece, has many ""effeminate"" characteristics. And although he is shown as having a girlfriend, played by the very shapely Debra Feuer, that character is a male impersonator; revealed to be either lesbian or bisexual.It's suggested that she is making sport of him all along.(Her girlfriend, just as an aside, is played by a young Jane Leeves, later known for Frasier and before that Murphy Brown.) Even a scene cut from the original release but available on the DVD supports this reading of the film as being about men needing never to let their guards down, lest a soft side show.It features Petersen's partner, played by John Pankow (who probably never topped this in movies, but was good, and funny, on Mad About You on television).He tries to reconnect with his ex-wife when his world is falling apart, and is violently rejected.The character who I think most suits the lyrics of the title song is played by Darlanne Fluegel. She's a parolee who trades information, and her body, to keep on Petersen's good side lest he throw her back in jail.It's suggested she may want to form a truer bond with him, but he blocks her every attempt. It's Fluegel who wonders why she's wasting her life; feels trapped and dreams of running away.But the character either goes unrewarded, or, depending on how you want to put some things together from the clues the movie gives you, was a traitor all along.In which case she gets exactly what she deserves, the movie darkly seems to be saying. Still, she's the only one in the movie who longs to fit her life with another person (or at least with a man-see above).Everyone else, whether a ""good"" guy or bad, thinks only of themselves.",To Live and Die in L.A.

Actually, I came away from this movie unable to find a single character who was likable.This was simply a miserable movie to sit through, and I did manage to keep the rental on the VCR throughout the entire thing, in the hope it would actually get better as it went along. Well it did, as I mentioned above, but that's a small consolation for having to sit through nearly two hours before getting any satisfaction from this movie.One other note, the car chase is okay, but if you really want to see the modern standard for those, check out ""Ronin"". As others have suggested, ""The French Connection"" is a much better choice than this stinker.",To Live and Die in L.A.
186,rickboylan,A correction for mm-39,10,1 July 2005,"In your review of this movie, to Live and Die in L.A., you stated that the car chase scene was taken from the movie Ronin. This is impossible since Ronin was released in 1998 and To Live and Die in L.A. was released in 1985.This movie is a great cop vengeance film. It shows how badly things can turn out if you sell your soul for revenge. The film does follow some others in style and substance, but it turns away from conventional plot twists and becomes its own twisted lesson on obsession. All the players are people who have some major flaws and who are not very likable by most standards. But they are solid people who you would or could meet any day of the week. Their flaws make them more realistic in my opinion.I would highly recommend this film to anyone who likes edgy cop dramas that make you think, and surprise you at every turn. This one does exactly that.",To Live and Die in L.A.
187,evipr,One of the best car chases ever.,10,29 February 2000,"Friedkin really tops himself in this L.A. crime story.  He directs a thrilling car chase that rivals the ones in ""Bullit"" and ""The French Connection.""Friedkin is one of the few directors that really understand Los Angeles. He films it as the desert/factory town that it really is.",To Live and Die in L.A.
188,mmasv,Excellent pacing and effective marriage of action and music,8,5 February 2005,"Worthy of the director of ""French Connection,"" the pace of this set- in-LA action thriller immediately draws the view in and never lets up. A car chase in the best traditions of ""Bullitt"" and of Friedkin's own ""French Connection"" is centers the action, but the motivation of a rogue agent obsessed with the death of his partner, and clearly with his own death, are well- and credibly- drawn. The most sympathetic character in the story is not one of the principals. It is a female informer. An ex-con at the mercy of those on both sides of the law, she is callously exploited by all. Her feelings for Agent Chance are more implied than explicit, but they are believable as is his indifference to her as a person. This riveting film never lets your attention wander. Thanks to Friedkin, we are told, we are given a credible ending to this taut, tightly- wound thriller. An under-exposed, under-appreciated work; excellent for the genre.",To Live and Die in L.A.

190,Cjae,"Contrite, Forced, Phoney, and Chaotic Storyline...laughable",1,1 April 2006,"The storyline of this movie had holes big enough to swallow....LA.What did Peterson's jumping off a bridge have anything to do with the movie? Why did Dafoe's character get into counterfeit money? HE'S AN ARTIST! Who was the person in the wheelchair Pankow's character was talking to? Where did they come from? Just some person to relay exposition at a convenient moment in a very uninteresting way? How did Peterson's character get the little black book from Waxman's house? Again, more convenient and mundane situations for the characters to relay information. The list goes on and on and on and on and on. There was so much of this movie that didn't make any sense that it was hard to watch. The characters actions were not true throughout the entire film. It seemed things happened to the characters when it was convenient for them without them actually having to do anything. The characters didn't seem like they had to work for a goal. Yeah they argued and spit and spat but in the end they got what they wanted and not in a original way. No, no, the person on the other end of the argument just gave up. UNORIGINAL!! It seemed like Friedkin tried to create conflict between characters where there was none. The characters would start arguing and give us contrite dialogue that was trying way too hard to be clever. Whichleads me to this:The only time the actors spoke was when they needed to convey information to the audience or wanted to say something clever (or what the writers think is clever). SHOW US DON'T TELL US. Scene after scene overloaded with exposition that could have easily been SHOWN. It happened throughout the whole movie, right from the start with Peterson and his mentor in the first few scenes talking about how they were such good friends and blah, blah, blah. I can't understand how an experienced director and a writer could write a script so poorly. I have to say my absolute favorite was when Waxmanhit Masters over the head and then Waxman digs through his books on the shelf and Masters girlfriend yells out: ""HE'S LOOKING FOR SOMETHING."" Are you kidding me. No way, really?!!!! Could we be hit over the head any harder. The idea that this is a good movie is absolutely ludicrous. Nothing about it is good, not even the acting, because these actors, who are normally great actors, had nothing to work with. It's hard to act when all your dialogue is based on exposition. The storyline was chaotic, actors came and went when it was convenient, the characters were not true to who they were, the dialogue was pretentious and shallow, and if in the end this movie had something to say I missed it because of how poorly the story was put together. It's safe to say that this is no FRENCH CONNECTION, and thank you William Friedkin for not contributing as a writer on that project.",To Live and Die in L.A.

192,tengri_gim,Ghost directed,10,21 December 2007,"I heard from an insider in Hollywood in the 90s that this movies was actually ghost directed by Micheal Mann of Miami vice fame and Thief and Heat. Big clues here besides the obvious matching of music and action is the actors. Peterson had a small scene in Thief and I think the strip club is the same bar in Thief. I don't know what man did but it seemed he was blacklisted in LA. Then as soon as things cleared up for him, probably contractual, he did Collateral. Notice he did mostly east coast projects. He lost his lawsuit probably due to both parties not telling the full story. This is Mann all the way to the lighting of sets, to the interplay of irresistible force and immovable object. But who cares, adds to the mystery doesn't it. Maybe I should see the DVD and extras and comments by the director and figure out why he would want to rip off a great director.",To Live and Die in L.A.
193,thejoeman,A masterpiece? I think not.,2,27 January 2007,"I love William Petersen and Willem Dafoe. I even like most of Friedkin's films, but this was a travesty. I kept hearing about how gritty and realistic this ""masterpiece"" was, and I would love to see the movie these people are describing, because it was definitely not what I put in the DVD player last night.To say the editing was bad would be an insult to many bad editors out there. At first I thought I had accidentally gone to the deleted scenes reel instead of the film, because the scene's made no narrative sense. The dialog was so bad that it completely took me out of the movie whenever I was trying my hardest to be interested, and the music was just atrocious. I'm not a fan of pop music being used as the score to a film, but sometimes I can let it slide (maybe Batman). I don't if it was Friedkin or Wang Chung's fault, but each music cue seemed to be the perfect opposite of what the action was on screen.Gay subtext in film can be wonderful in films (Little Children comes to mind). Sadly, this was not one of those films. The Rick Masters character was overtly gay, yet this was never explored. When we first meet his girlfriend, the viewer can't tell immediately what sex she is because of her costume and face paint. This could have been a great launching point for the film if it had explored Masters' sexuality as a source of artistic genius and social misconduct, but instead it goes nowhere. Is he gay and ashamed of it? Is he just an extreme narcissist, who likes to watch tapes of himself having sex? The evidence it there, but these questions aren't even brought up, much less dealt with.Chance was a conglomeration of overused cop movie clichés. Avenging dead partner? Check. Obsessive cop who blurs the line between cop and criminal? Check. Disregards superiors' advise and orders to get the bad guy? Check. Helps high-strung rookie get tough and do some dirty work to be a real cop? Check. And just for good measure, let's make him a misogynistic pig that makes so many horrible choices the audience has no reason to feel any sympathy for him... that sounds like a winner. Then there's the action. The not-so-explosive beginning was a disappointment and it continued like that for the rest of the film. The much-hyped car chase featured the hero's car going the wrong way on the freeway. This should be exciting, but Friedkin decided to put the cars on the wrong side of the highway to heighten the tension. Instead, it just took me right back out of the action. I should have been worried about Chance and Vukovich getting plastered by and eighteen-wheeler, but instead I had to wonder why everyone in L.A. got up that morning and decided to go British-style on the highway for the hell of it.I could go on and on, but I'll leave it at this: To Live and Die in L.A. was a terrible movie who's music, action, and dialog were dated by 1986.",To Live and Die in L.A.
194,modestmike,You lived a sheltered life if you haven't seen this one!!!,9,2 September 2002,"One of the greatest action films ever and probably the most misunderstood because its so ""anti-MiamiVice"".  None of the characters are the most photogenic and they are portrayed as the way they are not the way they're supposed to be.  The protagonist-Richard Chance has both good and bad qualities and the villain-Rick Masters has too much depth to be the personification of evil. Everything Miami Vice stood for in the eighties this movie ""To live and die in L.A."" went against the formula due to its graphic violence, unpredictability, gritty characters and realism. Nowadays action movies have to be too cute or they're borderline comedies to make it palatable for the masses.

William Friedkin was back on top of his game with this picture. Interesting and stylish film to finish with characters that are morally questionable on both sides. And, the violence is hard here with multiple people getting shot in the face throughout the film. This is a gritty film about the even more scummy side of L.A. It's interesting how the film delves into depth about the making of counterfeit bills and their distribution. William Peterson pulls off the cocky, get his man secret service agent brilliantly. And Willem Dafoe plays Rick Masters, who is quite the douche bag counterfeiter/murderer. The car chase in this film is right up there with Friedkin's early 70's film The French Connection.

If not for a glimpse of a decent performance by Dafoe this film would be rated 0/10.Looking at the film as a whole, it was needlessly long and overdrawn but somehow managed to have both an excess of superfluous scenes and a lack of scenes that would have aided the development of the plot and the characters. The film contains nearly no meaningful dialogue that aids character development, and was both boring and convoluted. The plot was driven by weak catalytic events and had glaring holes as large as my desire to die in L. A after watching this film.Petersen's performance was incredibly shallow and choices made were closer to a portrayal of a washed out alcoholic that reliably bored me. Much more could be written I won't waste my time writing more for the same reason I wouldn't write an essay on why a pile of shit stinks.Anyone with any idea of what a half way decent film should look and feel like should avoid this film like this film avoided any idea of being good.",To Live and Die in L.A.

199,Topazgirl,"Super ""the edge on your seat"" movie",9,24 February 2005,"Despite what other critics have said about movie, even though some of them were positive. I absolutely loved it. I first saw it when it started coming on cable, that was back in 1986 or 1987. I was 15 or 16 years of age. That's when I first saw CSI's William Petersen. At that time I had a super major crush on him, mind you he was in his early thirties when the movie was filmed. Up to this day he still is very much ""eye candy"", not to be vulgar. All the credit should been given to William Friedkin. He did a phenomenal job directing the movie. William Petersen's and Willem DaFoe's performances were fantastic, even though critics had their differences. William Defoe's performance was one of the best in my opinion. Wang Chung's hit ""To Live and Die in L.A."" still rocks to this day. Even though this movie was filmed in the 80's, die hard fans of the movie will oversee that. I cannot wait to watch it again on DVD with friends over.",To Live and Die in L.A.
200,lcl44,"To Live and Die in L.A. 20 years later, still fresh and authentic.",9,28 May 2005,"I saw To Live and Die in L.A. during its original theatrical release in the summer of 1985. I thought then it had the potential to eventually become regarded as one of the best cop films ever. Recently I watched it again on DVD. It absolutely holds up in every respect to its original verity and impact, and it undeniably should be regarded as one of the top ten movies of its genre, and in my opinion, one of the top two or three. What is so remarkable about William Friedkin's film is the uniformly excellent level of the performances of his cast. There is not a single portrayal on screen that is not, from first scene to last, dead on target. William Petersen as Richard Chance, an ambitious adrenaline-charged treasury agent who becomes totally obsessed with avenging his partner's murder and Willem Dafoe as Rick Masters, a fabulously wealthy yet sleazy and violent counterfeiter form the nucleus around which the film unfolds. Both actors are superb in their roles, but no less impressive is John Pankow as the new partner who approaches emotional meltdown as he gets drawn deeper and deeper into a web of illegality and violence stemming from Chance's single-minded pursuit of Masters. Also Dean Stockwell as a cynical mob lawyer in his glass tower office and John Turturro as a lowlife ex-con, each in their own way a lackey to Masters, deliver taut finely-etched portrayals that linger in the mind with their subtle impact, all the more remarkable for the relatively brief time they appear on screen. And the same can be said about Debra Feuer and Steve James in even briefer roles, Feuer as Masters' longtime girlfriend and James as a ghetto crime lord totally dependent on a constant supply of counterfeit twenty dollar bills from Masters. The richly detailed location shots within which the film's action flows, from Masters' BelAir mansion to the barrios of East Los Angeles, from Hollywood Boulevard performance art theaters to federal prison exercise yards is unflinchingly authentic, but never intrusive. And as a bonus to all this is a car chase that at least equals if not surpasses the one Friedkin directed in 1971's Best Picture Oscar winner, The French Connection.",To Live and Die in L.A.

203,athenaonharris,To Live and Die in LA or Miami Vice: L.A. Vacation?,10,3 February 2019,"To Live and Die in LA or Miami Vice: L.A. Vacation? (If you asked Michael Mann for title ideas at least). The feature film before the 2006.. feature film. No, i'm not here to talk about that. But you can't allude to the great Miami Vice (referring to the original series now - this is getting confusing) without mentioning the incredible and distinctive music. Every time I watch To Live and Die in LA i'm hit with that same feeling. Wang Chung did just as sterling a service to this film as Jan Hammer did in Miami Vice.I've watched To Live and Die in LA too many times. My 'too young to watch this stuff' son loves it too. He calls it 'car movie' on account of the very long, fast paced and thrilling car chase scene towards the end of the film.The year was 1985. It was a good year for action movies. Rambo Part II; A View to a Kill; Commando and Rocky IV to name a few. I discovered all of these gratefully some years later. At this point in time I was too young even for the Goonies or National Lampoon's European Vacation, further '85 classics. While we're in this year, how great of a western is Pale Rider? Preacher, played by Clint Eastwood, mysteriously arrives in a dusty, prospecting town and sorts out a greedy mining company owner terrorising the local, less fortunate residents. I'll save the rest for a future review.To Live and Die in LA. Enter Reckless U.S. Secret Service agent Richard Chance, played exceptionally by William Petersen. He follows the rules until the rules don't work anymore, then he.. no strictly speaking that's Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry. Its the same kind of deal though and equally as effective here. Trying to get the bad guy, black Ferrari driving, money forging extraordinaire Rick Masters becomes an unhealthy obsession for Chance. This is not without reason. Masters was responsible for his first partner, Jimmy Hart's death. A death made all the more tragic because in true Hollywood fashion the guy was like three days from retirement, man.Strait-laced, John Vukovich ventures Into The Abyss created with Hart's passing. Vukovich believes in following orders and doing things by the book. The end of the film has you asking if this is how Chance started out. But the job changed him. It made him hard. The stage is set.You may be thinking this sounds like Lethal Weapon. It's not. This is no comedy. The mismatched, buddy cop theme is present but feels original, such is the dark tone throughout. Don't be fooled by the colourful opening titles and synthesised music.Whenever I see Willem Dafoe in a film, I immediately think of Rick Masters demanding ""I want my paper"", then annoy the people around me by saying it too frequently. The hero is only as good as his or her villainous counterpart. Mr Dafoe was perfect in this role, his character, a complicated mix of usually opposing traits. Articulate, professional and exacting, but in equal measure a fickle, temperamental and reckless artist. His criminal activities allow a privileged existence including a mansion in BelAir and bisexual companion Bianca, herself a performance artist.He routinely burns his paintings - paintings actually created for the film by german artist Rainer Fetting. No reason is given but we see him derive some pleasure from it. This is at odds with the long montage during the opening credits, casting light on the complicated process of counterfeiting money, an operation that Masters is clearly adept.Chance plays a high risk game and takes Vukovich reluctantly along for the ride, doing anything to get closer to Masters and his operation. Ultimately Chance pays an unexpected and anti-climatic - but so realistic, #authentic?- price. After a moment of disbelief, Vukovich sheds his earlier vulnerabilities, chiefly his blind adherence to the rules and becomes a reflection of Chance's - ends justify the means - character. Enter his best line ""You're working for me now."" Cue music.If you're familiar with Hugh Holland's photography of skateboarders in the seventies you'll appreciate the warm colours the smog creates when the sun's low in this film. The colour palette is outstanding. The hazy exterior shots contrast beautifully with the moody and so eighties ambience of internal scenes. Strong greens and reds dominate in nightclub scenes and pervading cool blue light takes over in the common apartment setting.William Friedkin directs. Popular opinion specifies 1971's The French Connection as his most notable work. But I prefer what he does here.""I want my paper!""",To Live and Die in L.A.
204,magjim29,80's Cult Classic,8,19 January 2006,"If you love the 1980's you will love this movie. With music by Wang Chung to back him up Friedkin does almost a music video but with good overall performances by an eclectic mix of actors he pulls off a decent cop movie. The over all colors and textures of this movie can be compared to Vice and Red Dragon so it is very much a product of its time it even has a Presidential voice cameo in the opening (a great touch) plus one of the best car chase sequences ever filmed.

I enjoyed the performances especially the top 3 billing actor William Petersen, Willem Dafoe and John Pankow.

206,bones_weep_tedium,Interesting and challenging,8,11 November 2006,"Although this film has dated quite a lot (dodgy music, haircuts and fashions), the story is very engaging and rewards re-watching.Most action films are excuses to string together elaborate fights and explosions. They are judged on how smoothly they can segue from one to the other, and the story is just a nodding concession to narrative.As the years have gone by, this trend has developed into the point where we now have action films with more and more outrageous stunts and action, with more and more ludicrously thin excuses for stories. This film goes the other way. It is on the other end of the spectrum from Transporter, in that the action scenes are secondary to the characters performing them. In many ways when I was watching this film, I was reminded of Sergio Leone's Dollars Trilogy.The story is deceptively straight forward cop-movie fodder, though it does have some thrilling twists. What makes this movie challenging to watch is the way the characters behave. Its not even the case that the 'baddies' are more sympathetic than the 'goodies'. The truth is that they are both as dirty and depraved as each other, and the people around them either get sucked in or chewed up by their actions.I will definitely watch this film again. Visually its very neo-noir, using colour and tone to make exciting, stark images. Whilst some of the action scenes and special effects are a little awkward by today's standards, the car chase sequence is very exciting.",To Live and Die in L.A.
