This first in the series, City Of Bones has a strong resemblance to the quest for the Holy Grail in modern times.Young Lily Collins when her mother disappears she discovers that she's a belongs to a group of demon hunters and these demons seem to be everywhere. Among the great unwashed of Mundanes which is what these kids call the vast rest of us here on earth.These demon hunters led by the leather clad Jamie Campbell Bower search in and among us Mundanes for demons. Lily makes their acquaintance when after going to a Goth type club she sees a murder no one else sees. It's Bower and he's done in a demon. After that mom disappears and Lily joins Bower and his crew searching for the Cup of Immortality which mom very skillfully hid.I see already another film is in the works for this series. City Of Bones was nicely done with an attractive cast. But it will have to go some to reach the popularity of Harry Potter or Twilight.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
1,Leofwine_draca,"Below par, but better than some",4,25 March 2016,"THE MORTAL INSTRUMENTS: CITY OF BONES is yet another young adult fantasy adaptation of a popular novel. This one clearly ploughs HARRY POTTER and TWILIGHT territory, detailing a story that's extraordinarily similar to the famous tales regarding the boy wizard, except swapping genders and adding demons to the mix.Truth be told, it's not all bad, and it's hard to see why this was such a flop on release. I for one enjoyed it more than various instalments from the HUNGER GAMES or DIVERGENT franchises; it has a faster pace and more action, for a start. It's hardly a great film, but as a kiddie version of a type of BLADE storyline it's not the worst.The biggest problems here are the attempts to shoehorn in a typical twee and cheesy teen romance courtesy of the foppish Jamie Campbell Bower, which leads to some excruciating scenes. Plus, Lily Collins (MIRROR, MIRROR) is hardly what you would call a great actress - her eyebrows do most of the work. Robert Sheehan is another embarrassment. The older cast members are much better - Jonathan Rhys Meyers has a ball as the villain, and the likes of Lena Headey, CCH Pounder, and Jared Harris put in solid support. The demonic special effects (CGI, of course) aren't too shabby, and I enjoyed seeing the various beasties the film has to offer, even if some of them are heavily derived from the likes of WRATH OF THE TITANS. Bear in mind this isn't good enough to merit another watch, though; it's too much derived from what's come previously.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
2,SnoopyStyle,Complicated random world,5,23 May 2014,"Clary Fray (Lily Collins) is a normal teen living in NYC who starts to see hidden symbols and strange things going on in the world. Her best friend Simon Lewis (Robert Sheehan) is a Mundane and doesn't see anything. Her mother Jocelyn (Lena Headey) is keeping the secret world from her. That is until the secret world of demons comes looking for her. She is rescued by Jace Wayland (Jamie Campbell Bower) a Shadowhunter just like her mother. Her mother goes missing and she joins a group of other Shadowhunters who battle demons in a world filled with warlocks, vampires, werewolves and other dark creatures.If you haven't read the books like me, the movie feels like one long quiz. Like so many of these kinds of movies, there are long explanations, complicated history, whole new vocabulary, and lots of expositions. Honestly I have no good solution for this other than to plow through. Even then, the craziness keeps piling on.There is a randomness to everything. Just when I think I have a handle on this world, the movie have a slew of other things. They break out the hooker wear, the glowing whips, intra-dimensional teleportation and even anti-demon music. Somebody should tell the novelist to just cool it. There is a workable movie here. It's just surrounded by a history test. I could also do without the 80s music interlude. The teen love triangle melodrama is enough, but I don't know why they put in the cheesy song. There is so much in this movie that it might be useful to split this into smaller pieces. The fact is director Harald Zwart, who hasn't proved his flimmaking abilities yet, didn't tame this unwieldy novel.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
3,claudio_carvalho,Something Is Missing to be a Great Movie,6,13 October 2013,"In New York, the teenager Clary Fray (Lily Collins) goes to a night-club with her best friend Simon Lewis (Robert Sheehan) after seeing a strange symbol on the billboard that only she can see. She is also the only person capable to witness the murder of a man by a stranger in the club. Her mother Jocelyn (Lena Headley) and her boyfriend Luke Garroway (Aidan Turner) are worried when Clary tells about her weird ability. On the next morning, Clary finds that she has drawn lots of symbols in her room and she meets Simon to tell him what she did. Meanwhile Jocelyn is abducted by two men but she warns Clary that Valentine will chase her. Clary returns to her apartment that is completely destroyed and is attacked by a demon. However the stranger Jace Wayland (Jamie Campbell Bower) rescues Clary and brings her with Simon to a fortress called The Institute. Soon they learn that Jace and Jocelyn are Shadowhunters, warriors that fight against evil in an alternate world to save mankind. Jocelyn has stolen the Mortal Cup, one powerful Mortal Instrument, to avoid that the traitor Valentine Morgenstern (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) becomes powerful and dominates Shadowhunters and demons. Clary is also a powerful Shadowhunter and she has the location of the Mortal Cup hidden in her mind by her mother. Further, Clary and Jace fall in love with each other and together with Simon and the Shadowhunters Alec Lightwood (Kevin Zegers) and Isabelle Lightwood (Jemima West), they try to discover where the Mortal Cup is hidden in a dangerous journey. ""The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones"" is a movie with good cast and top-notch special effects. However something Is missing to be a great movie. There are lots of information to be disclosed and many characters are not well developed like, for example, Valentine. But the worst is the lack of emotions, like the incestuous relationship between Clary and Jace that is not well resolved. Clary is also a rebel teenager that shows no affection to Jocelyn and when her mother is kidnapped, she changes her behavior. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Os Instrumentos Mortais: Cidade dos Ossos"" (""The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones"")",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
4,nogodnomasters,DON'T YOU SEE IT?,6,31 July 2018,"This film is for those who grew up missing Buffy, Twilight, and Star Wars. For you older guys out there, make sure you take a bag with you as I discovered my theater doesn't take kindly to hurling chunks. Like Twilight, the film is designed for the female tween audience. Clary (Lily Collins) rhymes with Carrie (Fisher) and reminds us of clairvoyance, is the main teen character. She can see things her friend Simon (Robert Sheehan) can not, especially that symbol that looks like the head of a deranged bunny.One day Clary comes home to find mom (Lena Headey) left a mess and a demonic attack dog. Her life now consists of hanging out with a goth half angelic being (Jamie Campbell Bower), trying to find out who she is, rediscovering her powers, killing the beings Kristen Stewart would rather procreate with, and something about a cup. There is no Bella in this film, just an Isabelle. Could we please get off the Bella Donna word play.The film is a culmination of pop culture designed to appeal to young female fans. All others beware of nausea. Keep an eye on Clary's hair part as it magically changes aka Deb in ""Napoleon Dynamite.""On a side note: Both Lily Collins (Mirror, Mirror) and Kristen Stewart (Snow White and the Huntsman) both played the role of Snow White. Lily was clearly the superior actress by being able to read a line and use facial expressions.Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Awkward blend of religion and occult.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
5,kosmasp,Another one,3,23 May 2014,"Making movies that are targeted at young girls, teenagers and it looks that way. Now that is not necessarily a bad thing. It does drag and take the movie with it to the gutter (almost), when the quality does not live up to any standard. And I'm not talking about technical standards (whatever your take on the CG used in here is), but about a general story and character standard.Good actors are sidelined and get to do almost nothing (Lena Headey to name but one), but young actors are thrown into the mix, having to pump the volume on many things (from fear, to love to almost every other feeling) ... something that goes wrong most of the time. It's a shame, because good quality science fiction movies are more than rare. Especially when they try to copy the ""Twilight"" formula. The movie obviously was successful enough that we get a sequel. For better or (more likely) worse",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
6,Quinoa1984,"a lot of bad fantasy/romance movie ideas, and one monumentally horrible performance sink this",2,22 August 2016,"I could go on and on about how pedestrian so many of the generic components of this movie are, and that the hack tinkerer-borrower-thieves (please don't call them authors, even though one of them wrote a book series this is based on), or how laughable the CGI and effects are (this may be the movie's one saving grace... in spurts, like when a big Rottweiler turns into a, uh, dog-squid thing, it's hilarious), or that Lily Collins' eyebrows steal the show from most of the cast. Or that Jared Harris has the look of desperation (and maybe mild-to-severe drunkenness) that his father had in various roles over the years when slumming it is the polite term for what he's doing here. Or that Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, of all people, seems to be the only guy here trying to get SOMETHING out of this material and hams it up to a degree I kind of respect.But I'd rather go on about Jamie Campbell Bower. I can't remember the last time that a lead male acting performance in a major motion picture - and for how cheap some of this (or a lot of this) looks and feels as a picture made for YA Hot Topic girls (and the poor boyfriends dragged along), it's a 60 million dollar movie that's meant to launch a franchise (which it didn't) - sunk something else so low with him. I don't know if another actor could have exactly *saved* this movie, since so many things with the over-convoluted plot make it so tedious and dumb and boring, though maybe it isn't since so much revolves around a magic cup that can be reached by Collins through her magic as a uh Shadow-walker or whatever it is.But I can imagine that another actor, maybe who could get some decent chemistry or have some charisma or personality or ANYTHING REMOTELY WORTHY FOR HUMANITY AS A SPECIES could at least make this watchable. I'd rather sit through ten hours strapped in an Alex DeLarge D-Box seat of the Twilight movies with Robert Pattinson's smoldering and awkward tension than see this waste of air again. This is a person who got cast because of his cheekbones and blonde hair; how can it be for his acting? Ironically he also appeared in those Twilight movies, so perhaps there was a correlation. But none of his lines register, and he has a good deal of exposition to deliver so it does matter (I think I missed a few points here and there through his monotony), and he emotes like a dry sponge. The model-actresses in The Neon Demon had more screen presence, only there that was part of the POINT that they seemed so out of it and detached. Why do casting directors, or whoever was involved in the decision to put this man in this movie, think this is okay to throw wasteful, palid, skinny-white-as-f*** boy meat to presumably starving pubescent girls? As far as miscasting, Bruce Willis in Bonfire of the Vanities suddenly seems like a good idea! It may sound like I'm picking on him, and maybe I am. I simply can't stress enough for you how much of a vacuum he served; physically I can see it only in the most basic sense of (spoiler) who he is supposed to be familiarly connected with in the story. But at any rate he is part of the package of what this movie is delivering anyway: a tepid romantic love triangle, and hodge-podge of tropes from so many, many of these kind of movies, whether it's Underworld (vampires and werewolves and, yes, those did it friggin better!), or Twilight, or even god damn Star Wars(!), and a few decent actors like Harris and Headley are caught up in the miasma.A few parts are funny in a fun-bad-OMG movie kind of way, usually pertaining to some of the CGI creations or, at one point, blooming flowers and a sudden shower of indoor rain when the main couple finally first kisses. This aside, this is a complete piece of modern day movie garbage, packaged in the most cynical manner and appealing to the worst tastes (i.e. this poor excuse for smoldering - I mean, come on man, Spike from Buffy called and he asked his nephew to step AWAY from the cameras please!) Stay away.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
7,CinemaSerf,City of Groans....,5,28 May 2020,"My, but this is all over the place.... A feisty teenager - ""Clary Fray"" (Lily Collins) discovers that she is a member of a society of ""Shadowhunters"" who have been tasked down the ages with protecting the world from demons. When her mother (Lena Headey) disappears suddenly, she is forced to join with some fellow hunters and a battle royal begins with ""Valentine"" (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) and his evil gang of devils. It's got a surprisingly decent cast - Aidan Turner, Jared Harris and Kevin Zegers trying to keep it on track, but Collins and Jamie Campbell Bower as posh-boy Goth ""Jace"" just haven't the wherewithal to make this anything other than a really poor ""Twilight"" rip off; and JRM still puzzles me as to why he ever gets cast as anything - goodie or baddie - he is just so very, very wooden! The effects are great, however, and Robert Sheehan as ""Simon"" does try to inject some sort of personality to his character, but sorry - this suffers from a shocking lack of engagement that made me indifferent to who does what to whom way too early in the, rather lengthy, proceedings!",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
8,utgard14,Avoid this crap,4,9 November 2013,"Predictable, boring, and full of clichés. This is the first of what is supposed to be a series of films based on a series of books. It's all very trite. If you've seen the Underworld films or the Twilight films or a dozen other similar films and TV shows you've already seen this movie's elements, only done better.The movie's major flaw, aside from its unoriginality, is that its characters suck. The cliché female lead is one of the most unlikeable protagonists I've seen in a movie in a very long time. Clary is played by the lifeless Lily Collins, an actress I've seen in a couple of movies now and am completely unimpressed with. Clary is a self-centered inconsiderate brat. One of the movie's more amazing blunders is how they allow their heroine to treat the only likable character in the movie, her best friend Simon (Robert Sheehan) like dog doo. Did they think the audience would like her? I'm baffled by this. For what it's worth Sheehan is the only credible performance in the film. The rest are either weak rookies or vets that are phoning it in. It's not a good movie, folks.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
9,view_and_review,I was looking for Bleach,4,31 May 2015,"So I decided to watch this movie because the trailer reminded me of an animation by the name of Bleach. I didn't expect it to be Bleach, but I thought it would be cool to see a feature film with the same concept.Well... there was Bleach in there as well as Twilight, Four, R.I.P.D., Supernatural and even an ode to Star Wars!! Put it this way, this movie was lacking in originality in a major way.The synopsis is simple yet it was made complicated. A girl is able to see beings/creatures that others can't see. She is a part of a special race that can do that and that race is also charged with dispatching these demons. That's the simple part. It got complicated with a cup of life (or something like that), who's my daddy, the love triangle (or even quadrangle), markings and other stuff.The acting left a lot to be desired as well as the script. Some parts were so formulaic and spelled out almost like the actors said, ""let me explain it to the audience really quick."" And of course with teenagers you're going to get your WTH moments. Teenagers are always good for petulance, rebelling and being naive.The movie was very busy, there was actually too much going on. After it was all said and done I had more questions than answers. I'm sure some answers were given but I still had a blank look like, ""Hunh?"" It's just a head scratcher or a movie for a younger crowd.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
10,neil-476,"Very enjoyable, greatly preferable to Twiglet",7,20 September 2013,"Young Clary gets a few surprises when she learns of her supernatural heritage and finds herself caught up in an ancient magical conflict.Lily Collins is Clary in this adaptation of the first in a series of Young Adult books, none of which I have read. Much has been made of the fact that there are resemblances to the Twiglet saga, and it is clear that this is aimed at the same Young Adult (or, as I like to call it, Soppy Teenage Girls) market. This, however, is miles better than the Twiglet stuff. And I will tell you why.There is a good deal less emphasis on the romance. Clary is about a million times more sympathetic than sulky Bella. There is no ""How dreamy is RPatz?"" element. And things happen! There is actually some drama, some special effects, some action, some set pieces.I liked this!",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
11,mm-39,Six out of ten!,6,6 September 2013,"The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones is a mix between Supernatural (TV series) and Harry Potter. The Supernatural element of Mortal Instruments is the premise of Demon hunters who hunt evil things. Mortal Instuments merges the Supernatural premise into a formulated Harry Potter script. Similar to Harry Potter, Mortal Instruments has a daughter, instead of a boy, who finds out her family is involved in a secret world of magic, and demon hunting. The protagonist finds out about the secret society's institution which has a library, etc and other characters. There is a showdown with a master villain, which involves the protagonist's family. I found Mortal Instruments a new spin on the Harry Potter series. Did the movie makers pull the new Harry Potter version off? Sort of! Entertaining, but the story drags. I give Mortal a C + or six out of ten stars. This series will be the next Harry Potter as there are 6 books.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
12,siderite,Harry Potter meets Twilight via Season of the Witch,6,24 October 2013,"I wanted to enjoy this movie, I really did. However a very annoying lead character coupled with a below average direction made it really difficult for me.The story is the classical teen who discovers she has special powers. They probably are trying all of these movies with female leads as to attract the female audience to the productive teen fantasy movie segment. Yet, of course, the chick needs at least two guys fawning over her and protecting her until she finds out how awesome she really is. That's really lame. This year is the year of witches, all movies and series have to have one, this is one of those films.Anyway, back to the story. Lena Headey is the mother of a freak again, married with a weirdo again, widowed again. The casting holes actors fall in these days are really specific, aren't they? The plot proceeds like a mix of Harry Potter finding he is a wizard and the Twilight love triangle ... err... angle. There is even a medieval castle in the middle of New York (that, of course, people cannot see). Bad people are after the main character, of course, but one of them is Kevin Durand in a really tiny role. Give that guy a break, man, he is too cool for these evil henchman roles!Since I watched Twilight and I watched Harry Potter and I can safely say I wasn't terribly impressed, but I enjoyed myself, it would have been expected to at least enjoy this film as well, but I couldn't. The love scenes are ridiculous, the fight scenes don't make sense, the magical scenes either (check out the one when they battle demons, she freezes them up, and then they try to move around them rather than just kill them like they would do just a few seconds later when the demons unfreeze) and some of the roles in the movie are really confusing, like the one of the great warlock that seems to know all, appear out of nowhere when you need him and everybody trusts him.The acting wasn't bad, but the direction and individual scenes were clumsy and sometimes outright bad. I have no choice but to rate it a failure.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
13,KineticSeoul,Hmm it isn't that bad,5,13 May 2014,"Hmm this one isn't that bad, but maybe that is because I have never read the books. It's another teenage fantasy romance movie that is better than ""Twilight"" although that isn't saying much. If your a girl that enjoys movies with mystical powers, men and women wearing flamboyant or leathery black clothing, with pop-culture elements, love triangle and incest you just might like this one. I heard this movie doesn't follow the book all that well. But it just seemed like they actually put the effort to at least try to make a good movie. I just didn't sit through this movie thinking out dull and boring it is. I guess it's because of the casting which I thought really fit well into the environment and scenarios and because they seemed to have at least tried to make a good teenage fantasy romance movie. And while watching this you can really tell the book was written by a woman that daydreams about mystical fantasy romance stuff. I didn't think this movie was really good or anything like that but it's watchable. And I wouldn't mind seeing the sequel.5.8/10",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
14,Hellmant,It's still a heck of a lot better than 'TWILIGHT' and 'THE HOST'!,5,5 December 2013,"'THE MORTAL INSTRUMENTS: CITY OF BONES': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Another youth book adaptation; this one failed to connect with viewers at the box office and was a huge bomb (like all of the recent crop of films like this, including 'THE HOST' and 'BEAUTIFUL CREATURES'). It was also horribly received by critics (like most of it's genre as well). While it is a bad movie it's still a heck of a lot better than 'TWILIGHT' and 'THE HOST'. It does feature some decent special effects, mildly amusing action scenes and a strong leading performance from Lily Collins though (who was a fan of the books and aggressively sought out the role).The movie is based on the first book in the 'MORTAL INSTRUMENTS' series by author Cassandra Clare. The screenplay was written by first time film writer Jessica Postigo and directed by Harald Zwart (who also directed such popular kids' movies as 2010's 'THE KARATE KID' reboot and 2003's 'AGENT CODY BANKS'). The cast includes actors like Jamie Campbell Bower, Robert Sheehan, Kevin Zegers, Kevin Durand, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Jared Harris, CCH Pounder and Lena Headey. The film's story revolves around a New York City teenager named Clary (Collins) who finds out she's a Shadowhunter and that a secret world of vampires, werewolves, demons and other monsters exists in the city around her. Her job as a Shadowhunter is to protect the world from evil creatures and she joins others like her. Shadowhunters are half-angel soldiers, this is something Clary's mother (Headey) hid from her all her young life. Many battles ensue as Clary also falls for another Shadowhunter (Bower) of course and a love triangle develops (which is required of every current youth book and it's film adaptation).The movie is extremely fast paced, which I don't usually have a problem with but here it becomes exhausting. It's like the filmmakers tried to cram too much of the book into a two hour movie, making the overall experience of the film a mess. Like I said the action and visuals are decent though and none of the actors are bad in the movie (which is hard to say about a lot of youth book films). The dialogue is often forced but there is a lot of good comic relief evenly paced throughout the action and drama scenes. Like I said the movie is bad but not painfully bad; it had potential to be a good fantasy action film at least. Maybe the sequel will be better (which is already being developed, despite this film's pathetic box office performance).Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSU_hwOQSWQ",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
15,bowmanblue,Great (if you like teen movies),6,19 June 2014,"People keep comparing 'The Mortal Instruments: The City of Bones' to the Twilight franchise and you can see why. They (like The Host, Warm Bodies and Beautiful Creatures) takes a supernatural backstory and sets it amidst a 'teen romance.' And, that is what this movie is – a teen romance. Yes, you'll find plenty of monsters, plenty of fighting and plenty of supernatural shenanigans, but, ultimately, it's for the teens.If you like teen romance movies then you'll probably like this. If you like teen romance movies that have a healthy dose of the supernatural then you'll probably LOVE this! Everyone plays their parts well – they're scary, sexy or whatever they're meant to be, but the bottom line is that if you're already out of your teens, you'll probably have seen it all before.It's fun, but just don't expect anything too original.Did anyone say 'start of a new franchise?'http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
16,g-bodyl,I Liked It......,9,29 November 2014,"Now I am a sucker for YA novels/fantasy films and I actually read the first three books of the series, but it has been so long since I have read them. But naturally, I would have to check out this film, The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones. Despite the lack of originality, I found the film to be engaging. Everything has been done before, but I couldn't resist watching Clary fight demons and fall on love with the main demon hunter, Jace. The visuals are strong and I liked the look of the monsters. There is lots of action. The screenplay may be the weakest link as some of the dialogue was cringe-worthy, on the scale of the Twilight films. But I'm a very forgiving person it seems.Harald Zwart's film is about a girl named Clary whose world is turned upside down when she finds out a world of demons and vampires exist and there are a group of Shadowhunters that exist to kill them. When she finds out her mother may not seem to be all she is, she is put in a tough spot when she retains the knowledge of the Mortal Cup, which an evil man named St. Valentine is looking for.The acting was actually decent. Lily Collins makes for a better, more emotional heroine than Kristen Stewart did in the Twilight Series. Speaking of which, Jamie Campbell Bower was pretty good as Jace. Jared Harris made for an excellent Hodge, who is the ""Dumbledore"" of the Institute. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers was okay as Valentine, although he may have over-acted just a little bit.Overall, the City of Bones is a fine book-to-film translation, although I cannot remember how much material was left out. The lack of originality did not disturb me all that much but I shall point out I saw comparisons to Harry Potter, Twilight, Ghostbusters, and so on. But the film was fun and entertaining and it worked as a fantasy film. Too bad the next time we see Clary, it will be on the television screen. But I did like this adaptation, perhaps a bit more than I would like. I rate this film 9/10.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
17,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews,4,5 December 2013,"The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones When you live in a city made of bones your main concern is osteoporosis.Luckily, the teen in this fantasy lives in a metropolis only fraught with demons, vampires and werewolves.At a nightclub with her friend (Robert Sheehan), Clary (Lily Collins) witnesses a murder but is the only one who sees it.Intrigued, the assailant, Jace (Jamie Campbell Bower), introduces her to a hidden world of angels, demons and a mystical cup that is under the protection of Clary's mom (Lena Headey).But Clary's estranged necromancer father Morgenstern (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) requires the chalice in order to turn the tide in the angel/demon dispute.Based on the Teen Lit hit series, Mortal Instruments is a jumbled mess.

19,pennyelenabooks,Demons and warriors,5,11 July 2014,"Clary, after her mother's mysterious disappearance, founds out that there is a parallel world along with ours, a world where magical creators such as vampires and angels exist, and that her mother was one of the warriors who fight the evil. Chased by demons, Clary, with the help of her friend Simon and the handsome warrior Jace, will try to find her mother and a stolen mortal instrument. I haven't read the book, so I probably don't know if the film does it justice. But apart from that, it was an enjoyable film. The storyline was okay, the fighting scenes just enough and the violence minimum, even though the demons were really disgusting. Good soundtrack and costumes helped the movie also. Now, what I didn't like : 1) The horrible lines. They tried to be funny, or make a joke, but it simply didn't work. The actors played them casually and the result was a really awkward and uneasy scene. 2)The ending let many things unsolved. I know that there is suppose to be another movie, but I still would like to know some things, like what happened to Alec or Valentine or if Clary and Jace were siblings. 3) Through the film, some of the characters disappeared from the scene and then they reappeared casually like they haven't left. That was annoying. Other than that, it was entertaining, so 5 out of 10.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
20,leonblackwood,Slightly over the top adventure! 5/10,5,1 February 2014,"Review: What an over dramatic movie. I must admit, I did struggle to stay awake through the whole movie because I found it really long and and annoying in places. Anyway, the movie does start of well, when she isn't know that she had mystical powers, and then it goes all over the place. There are a few good scenes and the CGI wasn't too bad, but after watching the whole Twilight series, I'm getting a bit fed up with movies in this genre. They are all full of teenagers falling in love with demons and which I have lost interest in. Don't get me wrong, the concept of this film was OK, but once the love element kicks in, that when I switch off. Anyway, it's worth a watch but it's not that memorable. Watchable!Round-Up: If this movie was half as long, it would have been much better, but it just seems to drag after a while. The blonde leading character was annoying and you can tell that he was casted to get the girls vote, and the rest of the cast were pretty average. The storyline wasn't too bad and some of the demons were done well, except for the weird dog, but it wasn't enough to make the movie stand out from the rest of the films in this genre. Budget: $60million Worldwide Gross: $90.5millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there mystical, fantasy adventures about demons and shadow hunters. 5/10",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
21,TheMovieDiorama,City of Bones fantasises about every other YA franchise and unimaginably copies them.,3,12 October 2019,"""The Twilight Maze Runner: Host of I Am Number Four"". When every fantasy adaptation involving pretty boys, uninspired magic and demonic creatures gets compared to 'Twilight', as if it's the benchmark of young adult films, you just know something is clearly wrong. The Mortal Instruments saga, written by Cassandra Clare who started off writing fan fiction (go figure...), is probably beloved for a reason. I'm not entirely sure what reason that could be, other than quenching the fantasy thirst of prepubescent teenage girls, but heck what do I know.This adaptation isn't exactly doing the series any favours, by cramming is as many made up words as possible and hoping the story magically comes together in a conclusive sword fight accompanied by a giant beam lighting up the sky red. Yawn! A ""Mundane"" who constantly draws an ominous symbol joins a group of ""Shadowhunters"" at the ""Institute"" in an attempt to find the ""Mortal Cup"" which she uncovers by travelling to the ""City of Bones"" and uncovering her suppressed memory.Honestly? Much like the editing, my mind was melting. It's so overstuffed with pure ""mundane"" fantasy that it felt like enduring a marathon of every other sci-fi/fantasy/young adult flick that preceded this. Werewolves, runes, vampires, dimensional portals, incest, potions, warlocks, an intoxicated Rhys Meyers, demons, witches and yet another ridiculously forced love triangle just so that little girls can shout ""I ship them!"". When the plot isn't overwhelmed by exposition and backstory, which infuriatingly is pretty much two hours of the runtime, there are a few scenes that held my attention. The conclusive ""save New York City from demons"" scenario for example, although repetitious in other cinematic marvels, demonstrated the various strained elements cohesively coming together. Don't get me wrong, it's all undercooked and the stakes are as raw as Bower's acting abilities. But the visual effects extravaganza was fine to watch, I s'pose.British actors were putting on American accents and vice versa. The hint of the ol' Irish charm was scattered throughout, and Pounder was more peri peri than reggae with her questionable Jamaican accent. The main thing is that everyone looks drop dead gorgeous, the world is saved and they all live happily ever after in their beautifully youthful skin.Who cares for mediocrity when you can serve rubbish like this instead! If you like young adult stuff that thinks it's going to be the start of a successful franchise but instantly flops. Great. If you yearn for something abit more, y'know...substantial in life. Move along. City of Bones pretty much crumbles from the first mention of ""Mundane"".",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
22,freemantle_uk,More Harry Potter then Twilight,6,22 August 2013,"Since the success of films like Harry Potter and Twilight, film studios have been looking for the next young adult book series to adapt. With five books already out and a sixth on the way, The Mortal Instruments is latest series to diving into a cinematic adaptation, being more fantasy, than supernatural romance.Clary Fray (Lily Collins) is a seemingly normal New York teenager, who lives with her artistic single mother, Jocelyn (Lena Headey). Her best friend, Simon (Richard Sheehan), has a crush for the young woman, but she sees him more as a brother. Clary leads a normal life, but starts to draw a strange symbol, that leads to changes in her life. She begins to see it everywhere, leading her and Simon to a nightclub where she sees people, no one else can. Soon, Clary's mother is kidnapped and her only ally is Jace (Jamie Campbell Bower), a Shadowhunter, a half-angel, half- human creature, who hunts demons. Clary is thrust into a strange world of demons, vampires, witches, warlocks and werewolves and has to open up her own suppressed memories as an evil Shadowhunter. Valentine (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) is looking for the lost Mortal Cup that can create more Shadowhunters.To get the Twilight comparisons out of the way, yes there is a love triangle and a teenage girl has a romance with a supernatural creature. But, The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones borrows much more from the Harry Potter, having a world within world, many mystical creatures, having a term to describe humans and focuses on a young character who could be more powerful then she realises and discovers her real past. The character of Alec (Kevin Zegers) is the Rosalie of the film, having animosity to our major character.Continuing with Twilight comparisons, Clary is dependence on the other characters, but that is more due to the fact she is in a strange world and the Shadowhunters are much more experience. But, Clary is still resourceful, asks the right questions and is a go-getter who wants to get stuck in with the adventure.The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones is a standard fantasy adventure that, as already mentioned, borrows highly from Harry Potter. This is a film that has many predictable plot points, that we've seen many times before. This is a film that does follow The Hero With A Thousand Faces formula, but also makes you dive head first into its world and mythology, where other series would be much more gradual when bringing you into their worlds.Harald Zwart of Agent Cody Banks and The Karate Kid (2010) fame took on the directing duties and he makes a darker film to his previous efforts. Zwart brings in Gothic visuals throughout the film, from the use of a catacomb that is run by creatures with sewed up mouths and the Shadowhunter's being like a church: but Institute's interior looks very much like Hogwarts. There are some gruesome moments (even for the PG-13 rating) involving the demon dog and the extra limbs demons can grow. But despite all this, death is kept to a minimum.While The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones does have Judo-Christian iconography with its use of angel statutes and paintings, this is a film that actually side-steps being be a Christian, saying all religions are valid and avoids any mention of God or the afterlife.The acting for the most part is decent enough, though the dialogue is predictable and a little clichéd at times. We do get to see Clary transform from a regular teenager to a Shadowhunter wearing a short dresses, a leather jacket and thigh high boots. While Campbell Bower brings a sardonic wit to Jace and there is strange aspect that all the Shadowhunters speak with English accents whilst the werewolves are Irish. Actors like Headey and Jared Harris do offer a little gravitas to proceedings but there are really extended cameos with the young actors being front and centre.Zwart did show his action credentials when he directed The Karate Kid; but he seem to regress for his follow up film. The action sequences are for the most part fairly bland, typical fare. But Jemima West's Isabelle has some moments with a whip and looking really bad-ass when she has a flamethrower. Hell, give her a film.The special effects are nothing to write home about. There are not bad, but due to the limited budget the digital looked obvious at times, particularly the werewolves. Yet, the demons near the end of the film does have a cool, glowing effort and have a similar look to Kronos' minions in Wrath of the Titans.The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones has been have a torrid time with mainstream critics, but in all honesty, it is a perfectly serviceable fantasy adventure that is better to the Twilight series it has been compared to and will please fans of the novels.Please visit www.entertainmentfuse.com",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones

Though John Ronald Reuel was referring to his Oxford drinking buddy, Clive Staples (C.S.) Lewis, and the latter's misguided effort to create his own private Middle Earth (THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA) by throwing together a hopeless hodgepodge of talking lions, magic closets, Santa Claus, unknown royalty, dual identities, precocious kids of all ages, and the kitchen sink, the tradition of lame wannabes has continued to the present day. Less than a decade ago we had the movie ERAGON, based on a book then credited to a high schooler named Christopher Paolini. In theaters now is the ballyhooed ""first installment"" of another mediocre mishmash called THE MORTAL INSTRUMENTS, based on ""books"" by Cassandra Clare. Hopefully, this latest holier-than-thou pretender will go down with her namesake from Greek mythology as a harbinger of ill-fated outcomes, sparing the people paying for their flick tickets four or five more episodes. It looks as though the Narnia craze finally has been stymied at three theatrical releases, while ERAGON, THE GOLDEN COMPASS (HIS DARK MATERIALS) and the SPIDERWICK CHRONICLES (among several others) were nipped in the bud at just one. The American public is not as dumb as Hollywood thinks. It's clear from the opening scenes of CITY OF BONES that it is actually a CITY OF CANAD!AN PHONIES (with only a few seconds of REAL New York City stock footage used during the 130-minute running time of this yawner). If Miss Clare ventures to begin any more series with an eye toward rip-off adaptations, hopefully she will have the common decency to set her future stories IN CANADA, where they belong!",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
24,davispittman,No no no no no nooooooo,1,22 December 2015,"No no no no no absolutely not. Oh dear god this movie was such a disappointment. The characters were bad and generic, the script was horrendous, and the movie as a whole was just boring as crap!! Okay, the acting was just bad, not even going to go into detail, because all you need to know is that it was bad. Lily James looks OK in the movie, but her acting is bad. And the other main guy in the movie looks bad and acts bad in the movie. The special effects are nothing special, and the plot is so generic and stupid. I was going into this movie expecting it to be exciting, I got everything BUT exciting. I just got a stupid, generic, lazy excuse for a movie. There is really no saving grace here, I did not enjoy any faction in the movie, nothing! Dear lord I pray there are no sequels! Please no more sequels!!! Skip this and watch twilight or hunger games, or even vampire academy. All of those are far better than this thing. 1/10 for the mortal instruments :(",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
25,3xHCCH,Interesting Mythology Despite Cheesy Love Triangle,6,24 August 2013,"""The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones"" is about a typical New York girl named Clary. When her mother Jocelyn was abducted in a most violent way, a Shadowhunter (or demon warrior), a tattooed Goth boy named Jace, helps Clary and brings her to their Institute for refuge. It turns out that Clary was in fact a Shadowhunter as well, and a very powerful one at that.Wait a minute, didn't that backgrounder on the central character sound very familiar. It should! The story is almost exactly like that of Harry Potter, a boy who suddenly discovers he is a powerful warlock, who had to be taken to Hogwarts for training. This same line was also taken by Percy Jackson, a boy who suddenly discovers he is a demigod son of the god Poseidon, who had to be taken to Camp Half-Blood for training. Similar to the other successful young adult series ""Twilight"" and ""The Hunger Games"", we also have a love triangle here, involving Clary, her fellow Shadowhunter Jace, and her human best friend Simon. To be fair though, as was revealed in this first film, this Mortal Instruments series throws an interesting wrench into the mix to complicate the triangle.The fantasy world it creates its own mythology of an alternate dimension inhabited by angels and demons, vampires and werewolves. Of course, there is also the ultimate evil being. As Voldemort was to Harry Potter, or Kronos to Percy Jackson, here the super villain is Valentine, a Shadowhunter who turned to the dark side.The adventure in this first book/movie is the search of a certain Mortal Cup, one of three Mortal Instruments, bequeathed to the first Shadowhunter by the Angel Raziel. Valentine, of course, has his own nefarious plot why he wants to gather all three Mortal Instruments into his possession.Lily Collins plays Clary. I must say her thick eyebrows bothers me since she played Snow White in ""Mirror, Mirror,"" and same here. However, as the movie progressed she was able to get me on her side as far as her quest for her mother and the Mortal Cup. However, like Bella in ""Twilight,"" I will never understand this girly indecision.Jamie Campbell Bower graduates from his minor character in the last Twilight films to play the lead male character here, Jace. In my opinion, his appearance looks a little scary, too drug addict-like to be convincing as a hero. But I would guess he is really supposed to project that bad boy vibe that good girls can't resist.Robert Sheehan plays the third angle of the triangle as Simon. He is convincing as a nerdy good boy, unfortunately friend-zoned by the girl he loves. Cheesy as that scene was, I have to say that Sheehan played that realization very well.My biggest disappointment was in the actor who played Valentine and how he was presented in this film. Instead of the big villain he was supposed to be, he turned out to be quite weak and lame after all. This role was performed by an acclaimed actor Jonathan Rhys Meyer, but I felt he was totally wrong for it physically. Meyer did not have enough commanding presence nor negative charisma to be truly terrifying.Overall, this really is not a bad film. The pace set by Director Harald Zwart is decently fast. The cinematography and musical scoring were well done. Special effects were merely okay, but could be better. The mythology though can be interesting. You will want to read the book to get more details that could not have been squeezed into the film's two- hour running time. So despite the very derivative nature of the story line, cheesy love triangle and the weak portrayal of the main villain, I can say that I am still actually curious to watch for the next films in the series if they are produced. 6/10.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
26,peterp-450-298716,A faint uninspired teen movie,1,11 March 2014,"""Harry Potter - Twilight - X-men - Titanic "" in a belch causing cocktail. I was expecting a fun fantasy film but was catapulted into a mix of different films after a good half hour. It's apparently a movie based (again) on a successful series of children's books. I haven't read any of these since I never heard of them. I have absolutely no problem with that, but I expect that in spite I haven't read any of those books, it would be nice to understand what it's all about anyway. I must admit that after an hour I still didn't have a clue what it was about ! The beginning was promising and extremely good. I hoped it would go on with this zest. The mythological runes, murder in the Gothic club, realizing that she can only see the Shadowhunters and later the invasion of her mother's apartment. Until there I found it very entertaining and the start of a relaxing evening. Side note: I really wonder why the Goth scene is always involved when it comes to such themes.At the time that the dangerous looking dog begins to mutate into a monstrosity,Clary blows up the kitchen with the kitchen oven in a incomprehensible way and Jace briefly enters the room and simply kills the demon (Yep it's a demon) and sends it back to the ... uh ... afterlife or Valhalla or I-don't-know-where, it just goes downhill.It leads to a chaotic crisscross of mythological legends and fantasy elements that were thrown together in a tangle of incomprehensible plots. Before you know it you're stuck with a collection of werewolves, vampires, warlocks, witches and demons. The atmosphere of the film turns into a Twilight (Yeak) inspired movie, with an ancient legend as head of an institute, who apparently has been cursed so he can't leave the building anymore. There are suddenly ancient runes discovered. Clary gets in some way the inspiration to tattoo those runes on her hand after which she freezes a gang of demons with it. Harry Potter would be jealous about this fancy trick. As similar as in ""Beautiful Creatures"" and ""The Last Keepers"", Clary discovers her powers and abilities gradually. And finally there is also the budding teenage love (sigh...) and a triangular relationship. Clary must choose between a nerdy childhood friend who just transformed into a vampire and the new arrived person who looks like a kind of angel. It's a similar situation as in ""The Host"". This results in a ""Titanic""-like soap moment with a romantic wet kiss in the ""like a fairytale looking"" greenhouse, after which the sprinkler spontaneous starts spraying. Faint-time for teenage girls. For me it was the moment to start rolling my eyes and heave a deep sigh. Not out of sympathy but out of gagging frustrations.As a climax we get a ""Star Wars"" ripoff which shows that the evil Valentine seems to be the father of those two persons Clary and Jace. Gargle gargle gargle Jace ... I am your father .... Another sigh moment for me.Generally the movie is extremely dark and pretty grim filmed. The combat scenes were so disorderly and chaotic that you, along with the dark setting, had no idea who did what and what the outcome would be.Final conclusion: it's clear that the marketing departments scheduled this teenage commercial monstrosity that resembled other more successful and sublime examples. But the worse thing is that it's a blueprint of the ""Twilight"" crap.Maybe it would be better to read the reviews and opinions in advance the next time. Then I could spare myself of the suffering to watch this failed project.More reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be/",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
27,adamjohns-42575,Sad face!,5,4 September 2020,"It's a shame that this wasn't a more successful franchise as I'd like to know what happens next. I guess I'll just have to read the books or watch the tv series (Shadow Hunters), but I liked the cast of this one, with the exceptions of Jonathan Rhys Meyers, whom I usually love, but was very hammy and the character of Jace who seemed more like he should be getting it on with Alec and not Clary. Although it was nice to see LGBT representation.
It was interesting to see how many British actors were used to play Americans as well, surely they have enough actors to fill the parts?I think this film was rushed and that there was probably too much from the book that was omitted, I needed a pause here and there to contemplate the events that were transpiring, because it was all moving too fast.
It was like they were trying to make a rock and roll Harry Potter. And they seemed to be wanting to make it more adult too, but without the necessary adjustments that a film of this kind goes through, the odd sex scene, swear words, etc?A disappointment alas, but with so much potential, I kind of feel sorry for it as a film. I'm not sure who's to blame for it really, the two actors I singled out weren't so bad, but I couldn't say that it was the director or the editor or perhaps the original story writer without reading it first.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
28,Sherazade,Time to go bury ourselves in the books then...,8,10 April 2014,"well since the budget for this one was $60 million and it only grossed half of that at the box office, don't expect any sequels. Bummer. I was pleasantly entertained though I had been warned to steer clear of this film adaptation of the Cassandra Clare series of novels but I gave it a chance and like I said was pleasantly entertained and surprised. There were great performances and the were not so great performance. The lead actress, Lily Collins is a bit wooden and needs to loosen up a bit as an actress but then again she's young and she'll grow into it if acting is a profession she intends to make a life long career out of...Cate Blanchett she is not but practice and proper acting schooling could still make a Jennifer Lawrence or at least Dakota Fanning of her yet. Another bone I had to pick was with the acting skills of supporting actor Godfrey Gao who played the alluring Magnus Bane, he wasn't totally unwatchable but he also needs a few more acting lessons and loosening up just like Collins. The rest of the cast performed fine, notably Lena Headey, Kevin Durand, the truly hilarious Robert Sheehan, CCH Pounder and Kevin Zegers. In a league of his own, Jonathan Rhys Meyers looked like he just rolled out of bed to play the villainous Valentine and rounding out the cast he was fantastic as usual. Also to be noted is Arianna Grande and Nathan Sykes' duet 'Almost is never enough' which is/was a standout song on the film's soundtrack.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
29,invisibleunicornninja,"This ""movie"" is a low budget money grab.",2,12 March 2018,"No one would have seen this movie if the book did not exist. This atrocity only exists to cash in on people who wanted to see the book turned into a movie. I don't think I've ever been more disappointed watching a movie than I did when I borrowed this movie from the library to watch it. I know the book is usually better, but I was at least expecting some kind of entertainment. I might be a little biased because of how much I liked the book, but this movie is just terrible. The Plot - The plot has basically all the key elements from the book. This movie could've actually been good if the editor was sober while piecing together this film. For some reason all the scenes are placed in the movie out of order. If you read the book, you'll know that all the scenes are out of order. If you haven't read the book, then you'll just be confused - not that fans of the book weren't confused. The way the story is told in the movie is incompetent and incoherent.I don't understand how anyone thought that just putting all the scenes out of order makes sense. All that needed to happen is for the scenes to be put in the order that things happen. The people who made this movie clearly don't understand basic story structure. The Effects - The effects are really bad. The whole look of this movie is very cheap. The books were very successful, so I don't understand why the budget for the movie would be so low. The Acting - The acting is painfully cringy. All the actors are terrible. I'm not sure if they're just bad actors, if they had bad direction, or if it was a combination of both. Either way - all the acting is really bad. Intelligence - Everything is really dumbed down in this movie. All the characters act like complete morons. Everything about this movie is incompetent. Its not even funny. Its like watching a trainwreck. I have no idea how this thing got made. This should not be watched by anyone.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
30,Rob_Taylor,Whe Harry met Bella...,5,24 October 2013,"That's kind of what this movie feels like. As if someone edited together bits of the Harry Potter movies with parts of the Twilight films.But it doesn't stop there. There's alternate realities, vampires, werewolves and just about any other fantasy element you can think of thrown into the mix.Despite the hodge-podge nature of things, the movie wasn't too bad for this sort of urban fantasy genre outing. Admittedly, it's not my demographic, but I didn't have to slap my forehead in disbelief too many times.The cast give reasonable performances and no one stinks up the place. It was also interesting to see Aidan Turner in this. Here he plays a werewolf, which is a nice follow-on from playing a Dwarf in The Hobbit and a Vampire in Being Human, I suppose. I can't help think that he is being a little typecast, though.I've not read the books but I suspect, given the large amount of every fantasy element ever being present in the movie, that it might help. But I'm also suspecting that if you have read the books you might be disappointed. The film does a pretty decent job of handling all the threads and managing to give the audience the information they need to make sense of it without descending into unnecessary exposition.It did amuse me that, as well as the usual boy-meets-girl plot line, they made it into an awkward threesome with the addition of a gay interest. But even that wasn't enough for this film, because later there is the hint of incest in the air (no kidding!). Talk about a relationship being ""complicated""! Although it's reasonably entertaining, it is easy to see why it failed at the box-office. There's nothing new or unusual about it. Its cherry picking of just about every other fantasy concept going makes it entirely cliché-ridden and you end up with the feeling that you've seen it all before.SUMMARY: Derivative, cliché-ridden hodge-podge that still manages to be somewhat entertaining.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
31,bob-rutzel-1,Surprisingly Good,7,4 December 2013,"When Clary's (Lilly Collins) mother is kidnapped she learns that she is a Shadow Hunter (one who fights demons). Her mother tried to keep that from Clary, but now she knows. The story hinges on the location of a Cup the Shadow Hunters need to keep their line going. Okay, so now we add Shadow Hunters to Demons, Vampires, Warlocks, Werewolves, Angels, and Witches (no, Zombies are not a part of this as they don't exist). Is there anything else out there that could promote a new movie franchise? We will just have to wait and see, but this is what we have now.Truth be told: I was surprised how good this is. The acting by all is first rate and this is not scary. Yes, we are kept in the dark about many things regarding Shadow Hunters, Vampires and the like. I can almost count the sequels coming from here. And, all this is possible because of CGI and it's very good throughout. There is some magic regarding something called ""Runes"" that are tattoos on a body and gives that body special powers. Okay, they can be used as weapons. We only see one later on that Clary uses. Hey, she's getting into this and we are not surprised. In sequels I am sure we will see and learn more of this. We also have a portal that looks like and behaves like a Wormhole that could take someone to.well, we just don't know where. We will have to wait for the sequels to learn more about them. I did find one huge discrepancy (there you go again). Clary sees that Simon (Robert Sheehan) was bitten by a Vampire, yet nothing changes him. All we see is that he no longer needs glasses. That's it? And, that is not my understanding of what happens when bitten by a Vampire. See?There are, of course, many fight scenes and the choreography is fantastic. Kudos. There are some dialogues that are actually quite funny. Here's one: Alaric (Harry Van Gorkum), a Werewolf, hops in a pickup to take Clary somewhere and she says, ""You can put your head outside the window if you like."" To which he replies, ""I am a Werewolf, not a Golden Retriever."" Yes, I had to howl at that one. (Howl?..... Really?)The actors are somewhat unknown except for Jonathan Rhys Meyers, but soon they will beOkay, so what is next? Why the Sequels, of course.

33,rivertam26,disappointing,5,22 August 2013,"Oh I'm not sure I have enough time to list all the things wrong with this adaptation. But let me begin by saying that it's not the worst movie you'll ever see. Based on Cassandra Clare's Mortal Instrument series which I have read the film centers on the plot line in the first book the least good one in my opinion, As a young woman Clary whom discovers her hidden birth right when her mother is contacted. It's all very complicated. Let's just say it involves witches, warlocks, vampires, werewolves, a mortal cup, demons and shadow hunters. The main problem here isthe insipid rushed direction of Harold Zwart who did so much better with The Karate Kid reboot. There's no growth for any of the characters or storyline and the film feels jumbled and clunky. It has a very hard time finding any flow. The sad thing is that for the first half it's pretty entertaining before receding into some abc family nonsense. It also doesn't help that the costumes and makeup are laughably bad and the film's casting director should be shot. We have Lily Collins well enough in the lead role but Jamie Campbell Bower as the sexy, brooding, sarcastic, pigheaded Jace is a major miscast. Let's forget for a second that he looks like a crackhead lesbian his mannerisms are completely off and he doesn't have a lick of masculinity or sexual prowess that made him so alluring in the books. The roles of Isabelle is played decently but lacks the fierce sexy edge that she had in the books and Kevin Zegers as Alec really??? he's not unattaractive but he's in his 30's supposedly playing like a 15 yr. old. Magnus Bane, Simon and Luke fare a bit better but their characters aren't given much to do. Only Lena Headey as Clary's mother and Johnathan Rhys Meyers(except for those braids) raise slightly above the material. It's really a sad thing because although the book franchises standard of quality doesn't match up to the harry potter, twilight or hunger games series it still had quite a bit to work with. Instead it's a soul less, rushed cash in on the material that has it's moments but ultimately falters under a desperate attempt to create a new mega franchise that will never be. 2.5/5",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones

35,blott2319-1,YA trash at its worst,3,1 May 2020,"Remember when every studio in Hollywood was searching the ""young adult"" section at Barnes & Noble looking for the next Twilight or Harry Potter? Those truly were the dark times, and I have to say that I'm glad the popularity of these films waned, because from what I've seen few of them were worth watching. The Mortal Instruments is one that makes me laugh simply because it got the subtitle ""City of Bones"" as the studio clearly had plans to make an entire series, and yet it crashed and burned after only one try. There's a perfectly good reason why it didn't work...this movie sucks. The cast is the first big flaw in the film. None of these young people are good actors, they seem to have been cast merely for their looks. Worst of the bunch is Jamie Campbell Bower who is supposed to be the main romantic lead, yet he is a charisma vacuum. He also looks like the person who would be the villain, with his angular features and greasy blonde hair. Even the veteran actors seem bored and not invested in the film at all. Jared Harris has never looked more like he was dead inside than when he stands there trying to pretend that he cares about the definition of a ""Shadow Hunter.""I think I could take some bad casting if the story were good, but this one is just clunky. There is so much world-building that needs to take place in The Mortal Instruments that it felt like 80 to 90 percent of the film was someone mansplaining to Lily Collins how this world worked, who she was, what was happening, and everything else. It was buckets of exposition and that meant there was little time for anything interesting to happen. I always have struggled with magical powers in movies because they typically lack any rules or logic. In this case there seemed to be so many rules that they couldn't find time to explain them all, but it still felt like there was no logic to how it all worked. By the time the magical McGuffin is found, the film feels like it is in a rush to conclude, but they still are throwing out more exposition. I was so confused that if I cared at all about the story, I would have rewound multiple times to digest what was happening. I think they revealed that the main romance is between a brother and sister, but I couldn't be sure. The point is, The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones is a failure of a film, and it's a blessing that this never turned into a film franchise.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
36,brchthethird,A mish-mash of elements done better in other films,5,14 November 2014,"I'm sure most people's immediate thoughts on this will be ""I've seen this before"", and the central issue with THE MORTAL INSTRUMENTS: CITY OF BONES is that while it cobbles together various plot elements and tropes from other sci-fi/fantasy films it doesn't do too much to distinguish itself from them, and feels derivative as a result. That's not to say it isn't good, per se (it's certainly not terrible), it's just not that original. The most obvious influences are from Twilight and Harry Potter, but I also noticed some Beautiful Creatures, Inception, The Da Vinci Code and even Star Wars. Like those franchises, it has its own mythology, but the movie never really takes much time to explain it which may make this hard to get into for people who haven't read the book on which this is based (myself being one such person). Still, the action sequences and visual effects are cool and competently done, which are what the movie has going for it. Since this is a fairly typical YA film, there's some romance which still feels shoehorned in and cliché, bogging down what was already a dense story to begin with. And as if to top off Twilight, there isn't just one love triangle but two, or a quadrangle depending on how you look at it. Another positive, though, is some of the soundtrack cuts which I liked. However, the actual score even sounds derivative, and reminded me of Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy, and other superhero movies. Unfortunately, the only way I could recommend this is if you're a fan of the books or if you've been living under a rock for the past 20-30 years and haven't watched any sci-fi/fantasy films aimed at teenagers. That is to say, even though the film is visually compelling and has a good atmosphere, there won't be a lot that you haven't seen done before, and better.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
37,muamba_eats_toast,Not bad but not great,5,23 March 2020,I didn't dislike anything specifically I just really didn't feel invested in the story or any of the action none of the moments hit home.

38,suite92,Reasonable coming of age fantasy.,6,15 September 2016,"In New York City, young Clary starts having problems. She sees people and things that others cannot. She obsessively draws strange symbols in her room. She gets in trouble with strangers at a club and sees impossible actions. Her friend who is a young man is interested in her in a way that she is not interested in him. To top it all off, unknown forces kidnap her mother and ransack the apartment where the two of them lived.Clary discovers that she is a Shadowhunter, a dying breed who have fantastic magical powers, but are fully mortal. That is, they age normally and they die fairly easily. Shadowhunters fight and kill demons as best they can. They get their magic from inheritance (parents were Shadowhunters) or transformation (drinking from the Cup of Raziel). Drinking from the Cup also confers the ability to write runes on one's body; these often yield magical assistance.Their recruiting has been weak of late since two of the most powerful of their members (Valentine and Jocelyn) have gone off the rails. Valentine consorted with demons to gain their powers. Jocelyn hid the Cup to keep it away from Valentine. Valentine wants the Cup back, and goes to all sorts of foul actions to get it. Clary needs to go from her 'mundane' (ordinary human) state to being the most powerful and inventive of all the Shadowhunters in order to stop Valentine. She's shorted on time, since Valentine and his henchmen move things forward quickly.Simon is in love with Clary, Clary is in love with Jace, Jace is in love with Clary, but Valentine convinces Jace that he is Clary's sister. Oi. Magnus and Alec might be attracted to one another, but there is so much going on.------There seemed to me to be just too much going on. I do not fault the actors, but rather the script/book. For this film, we inherit structure from werewolf, vampire, and warlock lore. We inherit structure from biblical warrior angel lore. But wait! There's more! On top of all the rules and logic already involved, we have the invented Shadowhunters. Much of their baggage is not all that well explained. Where did the portal come from? How did they get all that real estate? How do they keep the real estate when there are so few of them, and none of them work, apparently. Where did the underground group dealing with the dead come from? How are they connected? Anyway, much as I liked the film, I thought it was dreadfully short of reaching sufficiency on exposition. Since there is likely no second film matching the books, explanations will likely remain lacking.Note from later: the property morphed into a TV series that ran in 2015. The quality was OK, perhaps, but I could not get traction on it to get further resolution than what I saw in the theatrical film.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
39,one9eighty,"Violating any members of the audience with a brain - no, I'm not a happy reviewer this time",1,25 August 2020,"What the hell was that? My senses feel dirty and violated, it feels like I've been robbed of time.Lily Collins plays Clary Fray, while investigating her mother's disappearance she finds out that she is a descendent of a line of mythical and supernatural 'Shadowhunters', a secret tribe of young half-angel warriors who are eternally fighting demons to make sure the world is safe. The world is filled with demons, warlocks, vampires, werewolves... but not zombies, because ""they aren't real"". She goes on an action adventure where sees her learning the ways of the 'Shadowhunters' while discovering herself and finding love - and hopefully finding her mum. Along the way she learns that Valentine (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) is looking for the Mortal Cup and that also becomes one of her objects.This film based is based on a book by the same name from a series written by Cassandra Clare. It is classed as urban fantasy, paranormal romance, and young adult fiction. I watched this film and quickly saw that it was a hybrid between the Harry Potter films and the Twilight films. Yes, it was cheesy, yes it was tacky, yes it was probably aimed at an audience 20 or 30 years younger than me. I didn't really want to say that this felt like it was aimed at young girls because that wouldn't be politically correct, but I can't think of another way to put it I'm afraid. There is a young girl as the lead character, she is a brat, she has to find strength to succeed, and she's in a potential love triangle between two different types of guys - both of whom are wetter than a washed lettuce and more wooden then Pinocchio's penis. Honestly, if these kids are supposed to be the first and last line of defense for the world from the forces of evil.... Then sod it, just let the end come.I didn't enjoy this film, furthermore as I sat there wondering why the Hell I was watching it, I was able to guess most of the next lines which came out of the actors mouths. I am not even joking here... the script was so predictable and formulaic that I'm sure some other movies could have lawsuits upheld against this. A lot of the development was suggested but never happened, things felt flat and forced, and there were lots of random occurrences without any explanation or justification. The longer I sat watching the movie the madder it made me... the plot was weak, the acting stiffer than a mannequin, the visuals just off putting, more cliché than a cliché dictionary, just stupid..... argh! Another thing I want to get off my chest, these kids were fighting in epic and highly choreographed fights which seemed to go on forever, I've seen mixed martial arts fights that go the distance and aren't as intricate - it was too over-the-top to try and make it look stylish. It was not!! Furthermore, the CGI and green-screen, not just in the fights but in general, was so bloody obvious it became off putting. Also, why did they all have to dress up like cyberpunk hookers - what was that about? Is there a certain wardrobe that 'Shadowhunters' must adhere to? Maybe there is, maybe I missed it like I missed a lot of the explanations and justifications that would have helped explain the film better.I haven't read the books so I am not a fan of the franchise, but seriously after this travesty I don't actually want to read the books, I don't anything to do with this steaming pile of prepubescent kiddie fiction. I just hope, for the sake of the fans, that the books are better. I can only think that the cast were drugged to appear in this, or paid extortionate amounts of money.This review probably will not win me any friends, but I must be honest to myself. Do not waste your time of money. I was always told that I if I haven't got something positive to say then I shouldn't say anything at all.... with that in mind, here comes my positive.......",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
40,khanbaliq2,"A mid-grade fantasy adventure with an appealing, talented cast.",6,22 October 2013,"I got to see The Mortal Instruments: City Of Bones for free in a theater. Sure, I went to see it because Phil Collins' beautiful Jewish daughter Lily is the leading actress in the film. I expected a decent time and the film delivered. Actually, it was better than I expected. This fantasy adventure isn't on the level of Harry Potter but I found it more appealing than Twilight. I don't read teen fantasies but, after watching the film, I began reading Cassandra Clare's books. Yes, I liked the story enough to pick up the book. It's an addictive read but a complicated one. For a change the protagonist is Clary Fray, a girl who is not perfect or profoundly damaged. She does what she can in the situation she's been thrown into. The love story in the film is mostly done well. Lily Collins and Jamie Campbell Bower do a good job at portraying their characters. After a strong beginning, however, the film becomes somewhat of a hot mess because it introduces more and more characters. The problem here is that there are no standouts to root for. This happens often with book-to-film adaptations. With Jessica Postigo Paquette's screenplay the result is mix of plot revelations, sweeping fight scenes, and emotional chaos that's not easy to take to heart. Still, it's all beautifully shot. The filmmakers invested considerable effort into showing the medieval-like settings in a modern city. Geir Hartly Andreassen's cinematography is certainly a benefit. The story has a lot of potential, the film features a cast of talented actors, but it's not easy to care about what's happening on screen. There's also a rushed ending. Sure, it was intended to be a multi-film series but the ending leaves much unexplained. Is it a terrible film? No. It's entertaining and I enjoyed watching it much more than, for example, Twilight (2008). I recommend it. I look forward to the sequel. Just don't expect it to be as good as Harry Potter or The Lord Of The Rings.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
41,MihaiSorinToma,A great world which wasn't exploited,6,30 August 2017,"Clary is apparently an ordinary girl with a normal life, but when she starts drawing a strange sign and sees things and people ordinary humans cannot, she is introduced by Jace to a supernatural world in which werewolves and demons coexist. As a shadowhunter, Jace is in charge with maintaining peace by fighting against demons, and thus, he helps Clary find her missing mother which holds deep secrets regarding her origins, childhood and special gifts.This movie features a great fictional world, full of monsters and magic places in which Clary and her friends must fight for survival and a for magical object. It looks great and the CGI is truly awesome but that is about it. Except some thrilling fights, there is nothing more to amaze you. I had the impression I was watching a soap opera much more times than I thought it was an action film. Too much romance, or things related to it, look there's father, look there isn't father and such nonsense instead of focusing on the interesting part of the plot. In addition, almost everything related to Clary in the action part seems too superficial and not very well thought, when I was expecting a bit more implication from her. Instead, she focuses of figuring out which boy she ""loves"" more, thus deriving from the main idea which could have provided a lot more than her sentimental interests.It could have been a great movie if it had done what this movie is all about. It had potential, it had a good idea, it had a great SF world but as always, they didn't know what to do with them. Big shame",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
42,gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297,"Not anything special, but at least it's way better than Twilight",8,30 August 2013,"When I saw the trailers, I became very amused and read all five Mortal Instruments books with a sixth book coming next year. Then, as I watched it, it turned out to be a very interesting film. Although, I do understand the critical reception it had due to it's similarities of Harry Potter, The Hunger Games, and Twilight, but I don't think it's as bad as they say it is because what these critics don't know is that ""The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones"" is entirely different than those films and much better than Twilight in my opinion (heck, even better than the ""Twilight-wannabe"" Beautiful Creatures).Before I can get to the good stuff, I would say that there are some flaws. The story is a lot more engaging than Twilight and Beautiful Creatures and the opening is well-done, but when it comes to young-adult film adaptations, it did left out some of the important stuff that have already caused an outrage to the fans, although they did give a lot of nice detail of the world created by Cassandra Clare. Also, the romance between Jace and Clary is poorly done because it transited some scenes a bit too fast and there wasn't enough chemistry.With that said, everything else was great. The visuals are breathtakingly beautiful, the scenery is nice to look at, and the special effects are very cool (even the creepy demons look realistic). The music score, aside from a few out of place pop songs, is epic with a lot of atmospheric stuff in it. There are bits of funny moments and the action sequences are entertaining, but the best part would have to go to a decent cast of actors.Lily Collins is very appealing as Clary and emotes very well with the supporting actors, Jamie Campbell as Jace is very witty, and Jonathan Rhys Meyers is very sinister as Valentine Morgenstern. The script is fine with really smart dialog and the direction from Harold Zwart is solid.Overall, TMI: COB isn't as excellent as the other fantasy films like ""The Lord of the Rings"", ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" and ""Harry Potter"", but like I said before, it's a lot better than Twilight and I strongly suggest that anyone, especially those who haven't read the books, can go check it out!

46,billygoat1071,Artificial Charms,4,21 August 2013,"YA movies has gotten too far on portraying supernatural themes and paranormal beings, but The Mortal Instruments can be a surprise for at least not sexualizing the creatures and aims to be adventurous for a change than adding more teeny romance. It looks like there's a rich world that could resemble to the one we saw and loved in Harry Potter, but in a much mature manner. The film shows a lot of solid ideas, but it somehow lacks something that makes fantasy movies likable. If this is not as horny as the Twilight saga, then the film still suffers for being a less engaging adventure. The technical work brings life in some parts, but the substance is merely a mess.Their world sure is something, but it's somehow hard to figure out what's the actual subtext of all of this. It's great that it's more interested in its fantasy elements, but there is nothing else to learn, especially outside of the ""Downworld"". We do not even know enough about Clary as a normal person, other than a teen who's been lied throughout her childhood. The film is hardly interested developing any of the characters. They are just pretty teenagers realizing that there is a magical world around them all along. If each ever had a subplot, they are as conventional as possible. The film is actually not in a total fantasy mode, there is an unavoidable romantic subplot that looks more like an awkward distraction, but anyway. What lacks is the pizazz to make it sort of less bland. Thus, the sudden twists feel senseless and the climax is kind of too long.I think the film is better off featuring its fantastical ideas. The production and special effects really helped glossing it into an amazing looking movie. The direction is also competent for moving things thoroughly and decently innovating the awesome stuff that these Shadowhunters can do and whatever this extraordinary world has. The action can be choppy in editing, but there's nothing wrong when they're wielding the blades. The performances are okay. Lily Collins is built to be a female protagonist and she is one of the natural charms of this film. Jamie Campbell Bower shows off some swagger, but that's it. Jonathan Rhys Meyers seems to have the strength as the villain, but the result is however underwhelming.Maybe The Mortal Instruments shouldn't be sentimental or have serious lessons, but there would have been something remarkable within the characters and the plot. I believe these people wanted to make another hit like Harry Potter or a better version of Twilight, but City of Bones turns out to be another one of those movies that thinks it's epic to just show stuff that people don't see everyday, sit down, explain, fight, sit down, do the same thing until it reaches the climax. But hey, it has more interesting details than kissing everything off. Though even all the gorgeous panache, The Mortal Instruments still fall short results to an empty experience, despite of the fascinating things we've seen.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones

I am NOT a part of that group, so I found the film to be a convoluted mess of bad storytelling and generic characters. However, I'm pretty sure the production wasn't interesting in trying to win my demographic over.The acting in this film is flat and boring but you can't expect much when you realize that most of the cast was brought in because they thought tweens would swoon over the choices—so, acting really wasn't something that was that important. Of course, it doesn't help either that the characters were generic and, to be honest, very uninteresting to me.Finally, the film is just a convoluted mess as the story does everything it can to fill (to the point of bursting) its running length with every conceivable fantasy film cliché that it can get its hands onand then, pretty much, doesn't know what to do with them.

Took me a year to read a Gears of War book and its one of my favourite Video Game franchise, you get the idea...So overall i got different vibe of this movie, it start promising but then it turned too quickly into Twiligh teen romance, its where i started to get bothered. The main dude is not really impressive, you are supposed to think he is some kind of hunter, but he is so skinny and although the characters try to dress as bad ass leather wearing guys/girls, they end up being whiny teens... The main girl never really show a true potential... i dunno, i was expecting more ass kicking from her part, and as some people mentioned there is just so much in this movie that is not explained, like why they say supernatural creatures have made a truce but vampires do attack them and are evil...Anyway i guess you need to be a 15 years old teen to enjoy this, and i will personally return to Underworld or Blade or more recently Supernatural for my ""hunters against evil"" fix...",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones

Judging by the reviews from people who have read them that seems to be a good thing as most of them seem to complain that the movie is not a good representation of the books. Then, when looking at the book ratings at Goodreads there seems to be a rather large spread between reviews loving the book and reviews hating it.If I had read the books I would expect them to sit on my young adult shelf in Goodreads. At least the movie is clearly for a teenage audience. Nevertheless it is quite entertaining as far as I am concerned. A bit silly and predictable at times but still entertaining. I would even call it a family movie although there where some scenes that might be a bit scary for the youngest ones in the family.The story is yet another variant of the classical young girl or boy discovers that there are things that go bump in the night and also that she is part of those things. I have to say that I quite like those kind of stories.As I wrote I found the movie quite entertaining but, although I cannot say that I have anything specific to complain, the movie never really lifts itself above the average crowd of entertaining movies. The special effects are OK but nothing more, the acting is average, the story is okay and so on. It was enjoyable 130 minutes and I never felt bored but I never went wow either.By the way, it never became clear to me why this episode was called City of Bones though.

It follows the book fairly well at least in the spirit, until about two thirds of the film are done with. But then it goes too far, and even commits the unforgiven sin of adding a spoiler that the books kept as a secret for almost full three volumes. The rest is fairly well done. The acting is all right, the story as has been mentioned is not the most original but it's not all that derivative too. The look is true to this era of cinematic magic, in which CG can make everything look real enough. The whole thing would've been so much better if only the script showed a bit more respect to the original story. There are no real excuses for a few very significant changes from the original taking place in the last 30 minutes or so of the film.

I just found myself rolling my eyes or snorting a number of times throughout the film. Magnus Bane who is so cool in the book, ends being really watered down and uninteresting. I don't know if it was the direction, the actor or a combination of both, but he came off really flat. Also Lily Collins is not really much of an actress. She's not terrible, but she needs help. I also felt like they glossed over details. I wanted them to take a bit more time explaining things better.I still like the overall story and plot. And Robert Sheehan is fantastic.

Alas, it's more like The Golden Compass, The Spiderwick Chronicles, City of Ember, I Am Number 4, or the Percy Jackson ""series"" (currently up to #2). It features a naive teenager who's heir to mystical powers but who has been ""protected"" from that knowledge up until a crisis from the other world claims her mother. The dotter, Clary (Lily Collins, the good Snow White from the bad Snow White movie), and her mom, Jocelyn (Lena Headey from Game of Thrones, The Sarah Connor Chronicles, and the under-appreciated The Purge) are perfectly fine, tho Jocelyn gets to spend much of the film doing her Sleeping Beauty impersonation. The rest of the movie is portentous and stylized. It has a few good action scenes, and an interesting wrinkle or 2 in the plot line, but it suffers from the same problem that all these supernatural/demigod films do, which is trying to explain the motives of the bad guys, other than just, well, that's the way villains are supposed to behave. It doesn't get all carried away with special effects but actually lets the actors perform. I will leave it to the females who see it to explain to me why the heavily tattooed shadow hunter Jace (Jamie Campbell Bower) is supposed to set young Clary's heart all aflutter, as he seems to me to be self-centered, boorish, and badly in need of shampoo.

59,Mike-DD,Never read the book - this doesn't make me care to read it either,4,18 March 2014,"After Twilight, it seems there are more books and movie adaptations on teens with 'special powers'. At least with the other movies, there is some background story, even if revealed bit by bit. There is none here.Monsters are culled from different cultural legends without explanation except that they are demons. There is scant explanation for the abilities of the Shadowhunters. The runes are so powerful you wonder why they don't use them for more mundane stuff, like in the Harry Potter series. The fight scenes aren't particularly exciting either. And there are convenient pauses in the fighting so people can look longingly into another's eyes or so Clary can marvel at her weapon. Demons get killed with nearby mortals seeing absolutely nothing at all - what, demons and Shadowhunters don't take up space? At least in the Percy Jackson series, at least there is the Mist to explain why mortals cannot see magical creatures. Character development is next to nil. I didn't care for Clary at all. In fact, I care more for Simon, who seem to have the best lines in the movie. He is excellently played by Robert Sheehan, who's the best actor in this movie by far. Most of the homosexual tension also didn't do much for the movie - not against it, just that it almost always token in the movie. Little develops from it, so why include most of it? It's just wasting minutes that can be spent more on the story itself. The romantic elements of the movie are also so ridiculously contrived. There is more chemistry between Simon and Clary than Jace and Clary, even when the latter is supposed to be the actual 'romance'.It does have funny moments as its saving grace though, and again, Simon seems to be part of all the good ones. The others try so hard to be funny they made me cringe. The story does move fast, although sometimes it seems as though it is trying to rush through to the movie's conclusion rather than move the story along.There is plenty more to quibble about the movie, but if you have nothing to do for 2 hours, it is still an acceptable selection to while away that time, though I found myself fiddling with my phone during the more boring parts - they seem to do nothing except to provide lulls between the çhases and fights.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
60,michaelhirakida,Rips Off Everything.... EVERYTHING.,4,13 September 2013,"Mortal Instruments: City Of Bones is the year's most ""Anticipated"" Release. I say ""Anticipated"" because nobody went to see it. It was a flop upon release. I went to see it today and hoped it would keep my interest, which it did. But, Even If You Are A fan of the Books (Which I have Never Read) you will notice it either borrows or rips off mostly any science fiction and fantasy movie ever... EVER.Its about some girl who finds out shes not a human and is some kind of shadow-hunter. They use augmentations to kill demons and stuff and they go to a church where the shadow hunters live and her friend comes along with them. There is this cup thats missing which is like the holy grail (INDIANA JONES ANYBODY?) and they try to find it or else they wont be alive anymore. Also her mother is missing.This movie has so many things wrong with it. Lets start out with the Title: City Of Bones. The so called ""City"" is a tomb. Now lets not get culture into this and pretend you are just a regular movie goer. Now, You would ask yourself like I did: What Would They Call The City Of Wind? A Windmill? City Of Water? A Puddle? When you think of that name City Of Bones you think: Well, this could be some kind of ancient city buried beneath land! Where hidden races live! But nope, Its A Tomb.The movie also rips off Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Harry Potter and The Sorcerers Apprentice. So many elements are stolen from these movies and put into this wannabe romance action film adaptation.The acting isn't half bad and some characters could be well developed, but they throw stuff out the window because they don't know where to go.Effects are OK. But its not always about it.Well, It ended fine. Even if the film flopped we don't need another one. If there is, be better.49/100 C-",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones

It didn't stand up.Teen TV horror/romance with a bigger budget but one that adds nothing to the genre. For all its vampires and werewolves it has no teeth whatsoever and I found it all dreadfully dull and dreary. The camera cuts away from any horror. The love triangle was uninspiring - and the incest theme was just tasteless and creepy...and unresolved.So many previous reviewers have pointed out the myriad of plot holes, I won't bother going in to them.

City of Bones doesn't have anything to catch and storytelling is weak. None of the characters feels natural and familiar. I am sure that the story in book is much richer and stronger than here. Despite of that City of Bones is not too bad to watch. Especially if you compare it to Twilight saga. It was good thing to go to see this movie without knowing much about it, so I was entertained enough to watch the whole movie. I just hope that if they are going to film more movies to this series they focus on characters more. Better script is unconditional if they want to succeed with this series.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
64,bravesfanc,You get what you expect,5,26 August 2013,"I've heard some people say this is just the same as the ""Twilight"" movies. I'm going to have to disagree with them. Sure there is a bit of a love triangle but that's really the only thing similar between the two. And let's face it, ""Twilight"" wasn't entertaining unless you are a teenage girl, which I am not.""City of Bones"" is the first in a book series which I haven't read so I can't compare the film to the book. It's another fantasy genre with demons and werewolves and vampires and the people who hunt them down. Except this time, it's the demons who are portrayed as the creatures who live within our world and are able to take over a human body.The group that hunts them down are called ""Shadowhunters"" and there is a select few left in the world. That's when the movie really picks up. Lily Collins plays Clary, a young girl who doesn't know how beautiful she really is and is blind to the fact that her best friend is in love with her. One night at a club, she sees a murder, but she's the only one who sees it. She screams and the people around her look as if she's going mad.This is how we meet Jace, the ""Edward"" of the movie. He and Clary have an obvious attraction towards one another. Regardless, Clary's mom disappears and Clary needs Jace and Co. help to find it. That's when the story picks up a little bit, but then we run into the romance of the film, which I believe they spent a little too much time on. I got a bit bored and started to lose interest.The ending does have a pretty good amount of action and the fight scenes were well done. It was a very pleasant surprise. Overall, this movie has a decent amount of action but it's just a bit too slow in between to really care about the characters. The back story isn't interesting enough. It also has a decent twist at the end but I kind of guessed it was coming. An average movie, with nothing spectacular earns it 5/10",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
65,PassPopcorn,Pass the Popcorn review,1,31 August 2013,"The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones is the movie adaptation of the novel of the same name, written by the bestselling author Cassandra Clare (whom, prior to the watching of this movie, I've never heard of). The Mortal Instruments is a series of six young adult fantasy novels, with City of Bones being the first of them. City of Bones is yet another of this year's Twilight clone movies, and is quite possibly the worst. Hopefully this awful movie adaptation, directed by Harald Zwart, will flop on the box office and won't spawn additional sequels along with a whole franchise.The movie follows Clary (Lily Collins) who seems just like an everyday normal girl. One day she (just like every other everyday normal girls do) goes to a goth club filled with people who look like Marilyn Manson wannabes and there she sees a guy killing another guy. Boring long story short, in a rather predictable turn of events it turns out that Clary isn't an everyday normal girl after all - she is a shadowhunter, aka a demonhunter. And now she has to join other shadowhunters - who are, by the way, obsessed with leather and latex and look like a bunch of pre-teen transsexuals - and fight demons while trying to find a cup. Or something along those lines.It's amazing to find a movie that's so absolutely horrendous, in every way possible. I'll just start from the movie's title. I haven't read the Cassandra Clare novels (and after watching this pile of turd, I don't want to), but City of Bones as the title of the first movie makes no sense at all - only one short scene in the movie occurs in this place called 'City of Bones' and that scene isn't really that vital to the whole plot. From my perspective, they should have called the movie 'City of Boredom' - and this brings me to my next point. Because of the unnecessarily long duration, predictable weak plot and undeveloped characters, this movie is one of the most boring movies I've seen this whole year. I also have to analyze this movie through the immortal words of the late Roger Ebert: 'Each film is only as good as its villain'. The movie's main villain, Valentine (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), shows up 15 minutes before the end, does confusing things and it's the movie's least developed character. What does all that say about The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones? Regarding actors, this movie is the proof that nowadays you don't have to have any acting talent whatsoever to land a movie role - you just have to be remotely attractive. ﻿Although, I don't know what kind of blind idiot could consider Jamie Campbell Bower and his bad-haircut wannabe-badass character Jace attractive. The acting in the movie is stiff, bland, unimaginative and underwhelming. However, the cause of the dreadful line deliveries could be the lines themselves: City of Bones has some of the cheesiest dialogues I've seen in a while. I don't know (and I don't care) whether this is the novel or the movie's fault, but City of Bones has a depressingly bad script. For example, during one part of the movie, a character explains to another how the famous composer Johann Sebastian Bach was a demon hunter (I kid you not!) and how he created a melody that, when played, shows the demon's true form (I kid you not! x2). Speaking of music, this movie has quite a corny, awkwardly placed and unlistenable soundtrack.Apart from ﻿the bad script, bad acting, bad character development and bad music, there are the bad special effects. The cheap CGI in the movie looks unconvincingly ridiculous, and the practical effects look ridiculously unconvincing. From time to time, City of Bones looks like a poor and charmless Evil Dead spoof. All of this makes The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones this summer's worst movie and one of the worst movies this year - and also one of the worst movies I've seen in my whole life. The first Twilight movie feels like Citizen Kane in comparison to this inane waste of time and money.Rating: 1/10",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
66,jonnytheshirt,Not bad after all.,5,14 October 2013,"I watched this not expecting much after its box office plummet and delayed production of the sequel. As a fan of horror and action/sci-fi/fantasy but not a teenage girl I have watched the Twilight series to which this was apparently in comparison. I've never read nor intend to read the books. It's got a bad slating but with little expectation I didn't mind it and was surprised to find it better than I was expecting. There was plenty of action, a few weird plot devices and some obvious bungling over the books story lines which stood out even to a non-reader. The cast were alright and it's certainly intended to be more grittier and less soft focus that Twilight. Jamie Campbell-loadsanames bless him gets a lot of flack. I will give it to him he has a striking non-standard appearance however something's not right in his acting chops and he needs to go off and do some stage show for two years, he was the worst Arthur I have ever seen in film and reeled out a dubious performance here. Nonetheless unlike Twilight I think TMICOB stands up better under scrutiny and maybe they'll do better with a sequel, I hope they get an opportunity.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
67,YJLcool,A watchable teen romance film with lots of fantasy creatures.,6,25 August 2013,"Similar to many recent bestselling fantasy young adult novels adapted to the big screen, The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones is another story about a 'seemingly ordinary' teen girl learns about her true identity and subsequently trapped in a love triangle (while trying to accept her destiny at the same time) in the midst of an eternal conflict between the supernatural good and evil.The film is filled with one-line exposition and overstuffed with many interesting fantasy/mythical creatures such as demons, werewolves, vampires, warlocks, witches, with the addition of nephilims (angel half-bloods)thrown in the mix but it never bothered to explore or show the specifics for any of them. As a result, the creature element feels borrowed...they're just mindless creatures which posed a threat for the main characters to fight as the story progresses. Some of the characters or even the main antagonist of the film, aren't properly developed due to the sheer amount of fantasy materials the film has to deal with.The runes, which seemed to be the source of Nephilims' powers and abilities, were never explicitly explained in the film, leaving the audience to wonder what sort of abilities that each of them will grant to the user.The film didn't even explain what the rune initially drawn by Fray earlier in the film is until you google it online to know what it is.Moreover, a lot of things were left unexplained or unresolved throughout the film: what happened to Madame Dorothea (the witch) and why she became a demon, what's Hodge curse actually, what happened to Simon after he's been bitten by vampire, why Fray is said to be more powerful than expected...etc.The romantic scenes involving Fray and Jace were fine and the chemistry between the two leads are believable. The absence of corny dialogues surely help to set this film apart from other similar films such as The Twilight Saga or Beautiful Creatures.However, neither of the dialogues presented in the film are memorable nor meaningful.Compared with The Twilight Saga or Beautiful Creatures, it's still a watchable film packed with enough suspense and twists in the storyline to satisfy most teenagers (girls mostly) and possibly some general audience.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
68,MsMovie,"Sorry, did not love this at all - very average fantasy movie.",5,16 December 2013,"The basic story from the book is good - but it reads better in the book because you get to fill in the scenery and actors with whatever you want.This movie had an average script, which was based fairly well on the book, but somehow came across as dull and lifeless. The fight scenes were a little fake - it was like I was watching actors doing a pre-rehearsed fight scene - which is exactly what I was watching, but in a good movie I don't think that. I think wow, I think ooh scary, and maybe I might think wow this CGI is amazing. In this movie I frequently found myself thinking, well, this is the worst fight scene ever, but then another would happen and I'd realize the first bad scene had friends.The romance in this movie is completely unbelievable too - at no point was there ANY chemistry between the 2 main characters at all and yet I'm supposed to believe they have feelings for each other... really? I mean, really? There is a reason this movie hasn't even come close to making back it's estimated costs budget - it's because it just isn't that good.If you don't really care if anyone lives or dies, then a movie and it's script and director have failed abysmally - and this movie failed to connect with most of its audience, save a very few.it's over 2 hours long - use those 2 hours for something more fulfilling instead!",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones

70,aaronjbong,"Fun, Interesting, and Magical",7,5 September 2013,"Another adaptation of a wildly popular book franchise comes alight. ""The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones"" is the big-screen adaptation of the fantasy book saga penned by Cassandra Clare. It borrows from other materials but the film offers quite an intriguing story line of magic. Here, the magical-powered people are called Shadowhunters. There are two possible ways one can be a Shadowhunter; you're descended from a Shadowhunter, or you drink from the Mortal Cup granted by the Angel Raziel. The story starts with Clary Fray starting to see strange symbols and seeing things other can't see. After her mother has been kidnapped, she is drawn into the world of the Shadowhunters, warriors trained to slay demons. She learns that the Shadowhunters are after one of the Mortal Instruments: the Mortal Cup. The villains are after it in hopes of conquering the world and the good guys are here to prevent the villains from succeeding. Along the way, there are many twists and a rich background story that makes this a wonderful ride.There are many twists concerning the alliances of the characters. In the beginning, some of these twists work and are quite surprising and therefore they work. However, as the movie moves along, similar twists are put and it becomes kind of repetitive that it becomes quite predictable (at least for me). The movie itself has quite an interesting and fun plot. The background is rich and the characters are quite interesting. It blends various mythologies and also incorporates some peculiar tiny bits (Johann Sebastian Bach was a Shadowhunter). The characters' motives are quite clear too. However, I felt a little bit down during the climax since the main character was not really involved prominently and therefore it was kind of disappointing. The film has a wonderful ensemble of young likable stars. The role of the protagonist is taken by the beautiful young Lily Collins. Her performance here was stunning and definitely a highlight. Coming in as the her love interest is Jamie Campbell Bower as Jace Wayland. Although he had a fine performance, it didn't match Collins's performance. The rest of the cast also gave impressive performances. The pace was quite well-done and it didn't feel rushed. However, sometimes the film did feel draggy in some scenes. The visual effects were incredible too and definitely a treat for the eyes. Characters were quite well-developed too. All in all, ""The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones"" is a well-crafted fantasy adaptation that is enjoyable. It's loosely based on the book. It's not for all and no, it doesn't put the love triangle as the main theme of the film so not all ""Twilight"" fans will enjoy this. If you just open your mind a bit, you might be able to savor the film. Rating: 7/10Final Verdict: ""The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones"" is an enjoyable adaptation of the popular fantasy book series with an intriguing plot and an excellent performance by Lily Collins.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones

Her actions make no sense, her attitude neither. The plot not even close. Is like they took out everything in the fantasy/horror movies and tried to put it together in this one. Failed, failed miserably. What's with the vampires or werewolves ? where did they come from? why vampires are bad but WW are good ? What happened with the vampires ? who were they working for since they didn't show at the grand finally ? The characters have such a inconsistent background, one can't get their role at all. They just pop out with no explanation, they harm then help with no explanation, they do things without any explanation, and the movie ends that way. Terrible. That little friend zoned sob is bitten by vampires, what happened with that ? No explanation. I would stay away from this series and the books also.

72,DubhDoo,"Derivative, boring and unengaging",3,16 September 2013,"Maybe audiences are tiring of the teen fantasy movies – earlier this year, 'Beautiful Creatures' and 'The Host' opened to poor reviews and hardly left a mark on the box office, which squashed each one's potential to spawn a franchise. 'Percy Jackson and the Sea of Monsters' was also poorly received and while not faring as bad as the others at the box office, it hasn't exactly been a runaway success. Following suit is 'The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones' which has been panned by critics and is struggling to recuperate its relatively moderate budget. All of which has recently caused the shelving of the sequel. In this first instalment Lily Collins plays Clary Fray, a young girl who encounters the mysterious Jace (Jamie Campbell-Bower) and is told that she, like him, is a Shadowhunter – a warrior entrusted to protect our world from demonic forces. In order to save her disappeared mother (Lena Headey), she joins up with Jace and his fellow Shadowhunters.'The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones' feels very derivative. Yes, I know it is adapted from the first in a series of successful novels, but even so, the film feels very similar (in numerous ways) to the aforementioned teen fantasies, and also the 'Harry Potter' and of course, 'Twilight'. It (unintentionally) borrows elements from all them but doesn't know to do with them and ends up veering towards a parody of the genre. This became particularly apparent during the scene where Clary and Jace first kiss – they are in a beautiful greenhouse, a (cheesy) love song kicks in and the sprinklers are turned on – which almost feels like someone parodying 'Twilight'. Through into the mix a laughable twist that states that Johann Sebastian Bach was a Shadowhunter (complete with tattoos) who composed classical pieces as a means of fighting demons.None of this would matter if the leads (Collins and Campbell-Bower) were engaging and likable, unfortunately they are not either. Collins, while not awful, is quite blank and bland as Clary. Campbell-Bower, on the other hand, is the archetypal male protagonist for this genre – he is handsome, strong, a good fighter, mysterious, broody, plays the piano and has a tragic backstory that makes Clary instantly sympathise with him; and although Robert Pattinson's Edward was similar in 'Twilight', he was good actor, making his character (at the very least) engaging, in stark contrast to Campbell-Bower who is a lifeless and unlikable figure on screen. On top of this, a number of excellent actors like Jared Harris, Lena Headey and Aidan Turner are wasted with underwritten roles and little screen time. This is not a very good movie; it feels much longer than its 130 minutes, something which may please fans of the source material, but which I found tedious. The action sequences are remarkably unremarkable (like much else in the film), the acting is largely poor, the script is full of jargon-driven exposition and the movie itself flows awfully, in disjointed and stilted motion.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones

Following in the footsteps of City of Embar, the Host, Red Dawn, Sorceress Apprentice and many other books turned failed film. This film walks well trodden ground retelling the same old story we've heard many times before. The good looking teenage models pretending to be actors do an okay job. They all have the same expression on their face throughout but thats not really their fault. Even in the clutches of death, they feel no fear. Even with the loss of a loved one, will she not shed a tear. The script takes the world of Hellboy, the fighting from Blade, throws in the conspiracy arch from Harry Potter, the love triangle from Twilight and the incest from Star Wars and mixes it all together to give us Percy Jackson and the... Sorry, wrong film. I meant to say Mortal Instruments. The front door of the house is destroyed, and is left for days (if not weeks) with the other tenant doing nothing, the neighbours doing nothing, the burglars doing nothing nor the police. Even at the end when the main character has the ability to do something about it, she still leaves it in pieces!The betrayal of a main character means nothing as we had no knowledge of his backstory which makes me believe thirty minutes was chopped of the start of the film. Other characters just pop up when needed, making me think they had action figures to sell, rather than a use for the story.The action was okay, but there was far too much love triangle for my liking and jokes that I've heard before. We are overloaded with good shadowhunters, bad shadowhunters, demons, mundanes, vampires, werewolves, some guy that walks around at a party in underwear, witches, warlocks, The T1000 Dog, raven monsters and who knows what else. Yet while this world invites us into invisible buildings, magic tattoos, and transportation portals - at no time do you ever feel in the world of magic. It all feels very earth based. The sheer grandness of the supernatural world is just lost. The city of bones turns out to be absolutely nothing but a room and again were back on Earth. Everything takes place on the same few streets jumping back and fourth to the same locations in hope that the love triangle angle can be escalated by having one of the them walk in on the other. This film is what it is. What it needed was originality, older actors, less monsters and an actual city of bones, rather than a room. Its not the worst film by any means, but its walking well trodden ground indeed and you cannot help but think I've seen all this before Worth watching, but don't expect a masterpiece or any rewards.

74,gazzalodi,An impressively talented cast that is painfully misused,2,13 July 2020,"You get Lena Headey, CCH Pounder, Jared Harris, Jonathan Rhys Meyers at the top of their games and then... don't use them except in glorified cameos!? Instead the movie focuses on some second tier twenty-somethings who might be able to pull off a decent supporting character if they had some quality direction. Which this movie really doesn't. No wonder this thing bombed hard. Shoot even poor Kevin Durand seems like his direction was ""Remember that nutty biker you played in Wild Hogs? Yeah, do the same thing but this time we'll say you're a demon.""Whoever wrote the script hopefully was sent back to serving coffee. The dialogue is beyond inane. There is zero character development. The set piece fights make no sense. Why would the vampires set a trap (in their own lair mind you) that includes herding the heroes into a room filled with very breakable glass panes... at dawn? Dumb.Having a script that is filled with religious imagery at every turn, then having your heroes snarkily dismiss people of faith is pretty darn insulting. And again, kind of makes it easy to understand why the thing sank like a stone at the box office. Protip for Hollywood. Just because you are too cool to believe in something bigger than your egos doesn't mean that people who have beliefs are required to go to see entertainment that dismisses them with a sneer.The musical score didn't match what was going on in the scenes. Swelling as though we are experience grand imagery for... a pretty standard library, a building whose walls go from kind of dingy to steam cleaned and a pool of water. But the music would have use think we are experiencing the Hallelujah Mountains on Pandoria for the first time.It took me seven years to get around to watching it. I shouldn't have bothered. If anything the movie just plain annoyed me with all the, times I thought... ""who wrote that crap', 'is that the best the director could get out of him in that scene?', 'why am I hearing this music now, is something awesome going to happen?'The second star is because in the five or six minutes that the A-list talent was on the screen they didn't just phone it it.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones

Lily Collins had to go through many disgusting and harrowing escapes as Clary. Soaking wet, wearing torn clothes and braving burns, she is the ultimate hero, seeing as how she cleverly used fire to burn a demon in the first scene. 2. Jace is surprisingly more handsome in film than in pictures. The way he movie is very graceful, something like Edward Cullen couldn't show. 3. The CGI werewolves are much better. Cringing at Twilight werewolves. 4. Of course, the clever cameras. For example, the first scene where they purposely don't show Clary's face to make us curious. 5. It is action-packed. And intense. Never a boring moment. 6. Although not much is explained about the Clave, this feels like a ""Harry Potter"" movie whereby only the main characters are any good and the others don't believe them. 7. While Valentine looks too young to be Clary's father, he is very good at oscillating between a loving father and a monster. All in all, just watch this film, you will be pleasantly surprised.

Everything that happens, that is being said or done has been done hundred times before with more impact. It feels like this script was written by some second grade computer-software made in China or India, a half-baked product comprised from many cliché input-parameters. There are many plot-holes, unresolved strains of the story and Deus-ex-Machina devices.

77,Sisiutil,"Nice try, but disappointing",6,27 August 2013,"My wife and I saw The Mortal Instruments together. She has read the books, I haven't. Our take on the film was nevertheless similar: so close, yet so far.The film had many things going for it. The cast for one, a mix of impressive young talent (Collins, Bower, West, and Sheehan) and stalwart veterans (Hodge, Rhys Meyers, Pounder, and the always-impressive Lena Headey). The visuals are striking, the effects seamless, the fight scenes combining just the right mixture of battle ballet and visceral desperation.But in many ways this is a film without focus and without heart. It's obvious that the world built in the novels is one of rich complexity, and it's understandably a challenge to squeeze that into a film. The best solution, usually, is to selectively pare away the gild to get to the heart of the story. In The Mortal Instruments, however, the filmmakers were too reluctant to let things go. As a result, we get too much world-building, back-story, and exposition--not to mention a lot of superfluous elements like warlocks, werewolves, and vampires--and not enough time spent for us to really care about these characters and what they're trying to achieve. Speaking of which, just what were they trying to achieve? Find Carly's mom? Find the McGuffin, er, Mortal Cup? Kill demons, vampires, and other monsters in a cool way? There are too many goals, not enough focus on one of them. Couldn't the screenwriters have combined all these things into one big quest rather than making them seem so randomly connected, if at all? A bigger problem is the inadequacy of the villain. Anyone will tell you that in an action/adventure story, a hero can only be as good as the villain he/she is facing. Rhys Meyer's Valentine, however, only gets a brief couple of mentions early in the film and isn't a factor until very, very late. He's not there throughout the story, thwarting our heroes nor subtly manipulating them like he should be. This means we're not that emotionally invested in the big final battle against him.In the end, The Mortal Instruments ends up looking like a pale imitation of Buffy the Vampire Slayer (the exceptional TV series, not the so-so film). More humour, better character development, and a more imposing Big Bad--all hallmarks of BtVS--would have made this a much better film. And according to my wife, the books have all that and more, which makes it all the more disappointing that the film lacks these crucial elements.Still better than Twilight, though.

Man, was I disappointed. This is your average lame young adult fantasy movie like Twilight, although I have to admit after seeing this movie that Twilight was actually much better (and I never thought I'd say that). The montage is very badly done. That makes the movie jumpy and very unclear. They want to add a lot of different species and story lines but it lacks the depth and they appear and disappear so that you actually get lost. Some lines are supposed to be funny. Yes, supposed to be. Some situations should have been funny. Yes, should have been. The intentions of the director are sometimes clear, but apparently he lacks the knowledge to make it work within this story and with these actors and producer. And there are a lot of things happening that are not explained or just silly and cannot be correct within the story. This really cannot be a budget thing, 'cause a lot of money has been spent on it, you can see that. Clearly it has been spent on the wrong departments, the special effects cannot mask the poor quality of the rest.I can go on like this for a while, but that would give to much attention to a stupid, badly made, boring and silly movie. I think a lot of people who worked for it or acted in it should be ashamed for making such a lousy movie. I hope it will not get any sequels, but I fear the worst, seeing the next one being announced already...",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
79,simondclinch-1,The best of its kind,8,20 April 2014,"I enjoyed it - the suspense kept flowing, the atmosphere had the right darkness.The characters were well developed and the violence wasn't overdone - I'd thoroughly recommend it.To compare with similar: Blade has much less plot and is gratuitously gory and lacks vampire atmosphere.Underworld has even less plot and tends to be continuous action without adequate suspense.Twilight has plenty of story, but this has far more and much more atmosphere.I can't think of a film of this genre that has a better plot than this.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
80,Cylac,Wow..,2,28 August 2021,Even after reading all the negative reviews.. I didn't want to believe them and was actually hoping it would be a omewhat worthwhile to watch.. wow was I ever mistaken.. it was very painful to watch from the beginning to the end.. so bad... I watched this with my daughter and she thought we were watching a Hallmark made for TV movie! LolNo disrespect to the cast.. but the Netflix tv series was a 100 times better and the cast was spot on. (Despite the first season being a bit cheesy.. wish it wasn't cancelled as the story telling was so much better),The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
81,xristoff93,How could Clare allow this abomination? Insulting and painfully ugly!REMAKE!,3,25 January 2018,"-So this is the story of the Mortal Instruments, City of Bones, supposedly based on the novel. The story is about some fierce hybrid warriors, humans that share the blood of angels(Nephilims-Shadowhunters), the only way the Angel left allowed humanity to protect it's existence from dark powers.
-The book focuses on certain characters during an era of what seems to be peace. But someone is pulling the strings from the shadows since long ago and action is set into motion by the villains and some random events.
-A certain teenage girl gets dragged into the World of Shadow and crazy things start happening, revealing things about her and her life that she completely ignored up to that point. Jace,Alek,Izabell and Simon accompany her into this messed up turn of events and the adventure begins. While the book drags you wholeheartedly into a world of magic, young love and suspence the movie fails beyond any imagination/expectation.
-Of course, noone would expect that it would be easy to pass a 500page book into the big screen and not leave certain things outside-and that would be understandable,I mean we have all watched Harry Potter,LotR etc and did not go crazy about it. But this movie....Oh this movie....has disgraced every bit of the book. 
-The story is different, things that have never happened in the book are there while other much more important things are either completely absent or totally twisted. The personalities of almost every character is changed and watered down so they lose almost everything special about them. Even friends who have not read a single line of the book could not feel any connection to the characters,sympathise or even understand certain parts of the story because things are constantly thrown in without any explanation. The plot was perforated and rushed, the romance between the 2 protagonists felt forced and was full of cheesiness, while in the books I could describe it as the definition of true and unfathomable young love.
-Jace is supposed to have long hair and golden eyes,beautiful and fierce like a vengeful angel, with a tough personality, full of internal conflict and true kindness burried deep within and that was his charm. Clary was supposed to be fiery and stubborn but also sweet and fragile and we see none of that. Jace in the movie appears like a drug addict. The scene of the kiss was just making everyone feel uncomfortable. As for Valentine, he is supposed to be an older tall man, with great power and long blone hair,almost white,he is complex with a twisted sense of morality...And here is presented like an one sided thug who looks like Jace's elder brother with ridiculous outfit and short brown hair like he came out of some club in a backstreet in Brooklyn . Totally ruined!!
-The crazy thing is they actually spent 120 million dollars for this production. Where was all that money spent on? This story held great potential. It could have been even greater than the Harry Potter universe. Now it's not even worth mentioning.
-In the theater only 14year old girls seemed to enjoy it. The rest laughed and cringed the whole time with this pathetic outcome of a movie.
-Why did they not stick to the original story? How could Clare allow this to happen? It is reasonable to care about money, she must have made a ton out of selling the rights for this movie to happen.But didn't she care at all about her fans, let alone her legacy as an artist? Despite how it pains me to say it, and it trully does since I fell in love with this story as soon as I laid my eyes on this book's first line, this movie was an utter failure and an insult even, towards all fans that supported the author. She should have known better. MAKE A REMAKE!!!",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
82,Big_D_Box_Office_Score,I want my money back.,2,23 August 2013,"You know, I really wanted to give The Mortal Instruments: City of  Bones﻿ a fair shake. I mean, it LOOKED like another Twilight clone...it  SOUNDED like another Twilight clone...it even FELT like a Twilight  clone. (Don't ask me how I know how it felt.) But, I was determined not  to judge a book by it's movie (ha!), and went to see City of Bones last  night.  It's a Twilight clone. And a terrible one, at that.  Listen, it's clear that this type of movie has an audience, and I am by  no means a typical member of that audience. On top of that, I am not  familiar at all with the books. But none of that should matter - a  movie should have enough merit to be watchable by anyone, even outside  of the usual demographic. And this was nearly UNWATCHABLE.  Let's try to do pros and cons. This should be fun...  Pros:   - Lily Collins, the main character and poor man's Kristen Stewart, was  also in Priest﻿...one of the lowest-scored movies in BDBOS history.  So...she's consistent.   - You know those people who ALWAYS say, ""The book was waaay better than  the movie""? Again, never read them myself, but I can't imagine the  books being ANY WORSE THAN THIS, so at least that will be an easy  argument to win.   - Lena Headey, aka 300﻿'s Queen of the Spartans, still gets to kick a  little bit of ass.   Cons:   - I've read that a considerable amount of the book was cut from the  movie, simply because it was impossible to fit everything into a 2-hour  film. I feel like whatever was cut from the book would have made a  better 2 hours of movie. So many plot holes, so many needlessly  unanswered questions, so many things that DON'T MAKE A GODDAMN BIT OF  SENSE.   - Twilight did this already. If you're a Twilight person, you've seen  this movie already. Awkward, ordinary teenaged girl, thrust into a  secret world where supernatural beings battle each other, and gaining  multiple One-Direction-looking love interests along the way. If you  told me that this movie was really called ""Twilight: The Other New  Moon's Eclipse At Dawn"", I'd believe you without argument.  - In God's name, WHY IS THERE AN IMAX VERSION OF THIS??? STOP IT,  Hollywood. It's hard enough to justify watching 2 dimensions of this  crap.   - This movie might actually be cheezier than Twilight. Terrible one-  liners, public shows of affection at awkward times, and a plot twist  that will make you feel REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE about things you saw  previously in the film.  - When the audience (which was practically empty in my theater, by the  way) starts laughing at parts of the movie that aren't supposed to be  funny...you have a problem.   - It's over 2 hours long...and you'll feel EVERY LAST MINUTE of it.  City Of Bones scores a 1 out of 5 on the BDBOS, and should not be  watched by human eyes. Vampires and werewolves should probably stay  away, too.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
83,star_hazard,Better than the book,6,30 October 2013,I've watched this first then tried the book...couldn't even finish the book. (Don't even try with the book the girl there was terribly whiny and ugh and Jace gave way too much info and a narcissist...it was just bad) The movie's not great but tolerable and gave so much but explained too little that left the audience a bit info overload. (if this ever gets a 2nd hopefully they can tie the looses ends)Personally I liked both the actor/actress for the main characters they worked well for me and had enough chemistry to pass their love scene as realistic. :DThe dialogue..ehm. Well Jace's and Clary's banters were the best among the rest I guess.,The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
84,superduperspit,"Surprisingly fun and energetic, well made",8,14 September 2013,"Mortal Instruments: City of Bones feels destined to be a minor young adult-fiction adaptation, so much that it feels like a 2 hour CW pilot more than a film.But that's OK. Because it'd be a great pilot, worthy of being called a Joss Whedon cousin.City of Bones has a lot of personality and life. It provides enough humor to let the audience know, it knows the movie is supposed to be fun. Moreso, the action scenes have personality, are clean and move with purpose. The action tells a visual story instead of hammering the audience over the head sensually.Despite all the plot devices, it still feels a character film. The love triangle is more important than the learning to be a hero plot. Which is just fine. Clary, Jace and Simon are likable and have emotions and heart. I was sold on the love triangle.Mortal of Instruments: City of Bones is great filmmaking by Harald Zwart. He balances the action and character building moments well, making a fun, fast moving film with a heart. Simplicity is City of Bones' friend. Directors of bigger blockbusters could learn from a film like City of Bones, in how clean and fun its action scenes are and how they serve to support its characters' story, rather than overwhelm it.Hopefully City of Ashes is on the way, despite the first film's box-office performance. I'd like to revisit these characters. Perhaps it's not too late for the CW to make a television series out of this, otherwise.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones

87,hyattjenny18,Better than I thought,9,18 October 2020,"I watched this movie to satisfy my curiosity, I watched the 2016-2019 series Shadowhunters, which is the tv series based on the book series The Mortal instruments. I have never read the book series, but stumbled upon the tv series Shadowhunters on Hulu and binge watched the entire series twice in a row. I was so interested in the series I was looking for more  but after reading the reviews I seriously considered not watching the movie. For anyone who is disappointed with this movie or everyone in general who is interested in watching the movie adaptation, I recommend watching Shadowhunters instead. The movie is ok, better than I thought it would be, but it ends before tying up the loose ends, however the series ties up all the loose ends. My problem is I wish the series continued on past the point where it ended. My favorite line in the movie is where Luke states to Clery he is a werewolf not a golden retriever. In many of the complaints I read in the reviews about this movie not stacking up to the plot of the book series and the movie not developing the characters or certain aspects of the books story enough is all addressed in the TV series Shadowhunters. Example Clery creating runes, Alec's love for Jace you get the point.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
88,dareent-amethyst,Just awful,1,28 August 2013,"I saw The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones a few days ago with my friends. We went in with a very high expectation since this movie's ad poster is all over Singapore. You can find the movie poster in almost every bus stops and every malls. I thought the poster was interesting and my friends convinced me it was going to be awesome. So we went in feeling happy and excited. Guess what? 2 out of my 10 friends fell asleep after only half an hour. I almost fell asleep after the first half of the movie but decided I should wait. Thinking maybe the second half of the movie would be good. Foolish me, it was just as bad as the first half. The storyline is quite interesting but it came out pretty dull and boring in the movie. The characters were not convincing and there were too many plot holes that it's hard for the audience to understand what the movie is about and what was going on. I still don't understand half of the movie. It really sucks because this movie had the potential to be great, especially considering the money it took to create and promote it. SPOILER: Don't say 'awww that's so sweet' or think 'oh I wish I was him/ her, this scene is really romantic' when you're watching the kissing scene of the two main characters in the movie. Because the movie suggested incest- that the two love birds are blood related siblings. Although the movie doesn't make that point clear and left it all for the audience to decide, we all know they are really siblings.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
89,ted-peterson,"Harry Potter, Where Is Thy Stain?",2,16 October 2013,"Spoiler AlertI have one big problem with this derivative movie other than it being a derivative of several films and cinematic styles. It is almost impossible to figure out what this movie is about. It drifts from idea to idea with no resolution. Looking at something like this reminds me of the ""Underworld"" franchise without the good writing. Like the Paolini novels, the books may be substantially better than this realization. The only character with any real legs is Simon the feckless wanna be boyfriend who is mainly in the movie for comic relief. He does a good job with his portrayal of clueless innocence coming aware of a greater reality of which he has no part. Would someone please explain to me what the attractiveness of a British accent and greasy hair have for young girls? Everything at night and dark clothes and petulant poses do not make anybody more attractive. The club scene, a complete knockoff of the ""Blade"" series, shows us what? A hidden symbol in a sign that only the cognizant can see like the sign in HP 1 at the ""Leaky Cauldron"" when Harry and Hagrid approach the café? The ""Ghost Busters"" Beacon? Even a Gost Busters fire extinguisher? A magic portal like ""Stargate? Here the search for a missing mother with already missing father is a recurring theme in these movies as if any kind of cohesive family renders the population un-magical and by implication, unimportant. I simply don't get this. Bach is a shadow hunter? What a crock. Bach wrote hundreds of compositions. He directed the services at five different churches. Directed and rehearsed up to five choirs per week. He wrote instruction books. Taught his children music. Thirteen of his twenty-one progeny survived. Three of which went on to become noted composers in their own right. Are they shadow hunters too? Bach was very religious and wrote works for the major religions of his day: Lutheran and Catholic. When did he have time to hunt shadows. The only shadows he fought was those cast by failing candles while he wrote music late into the night. When one looks at this feeble effort to create a franchise like that of Harry Potter, the dearth of imagination becomes clear. People looking to experience again the magic of Harry Potter might want to take a vacation from such a pursuit. The world created in HP is a once in a generation or two thing. It was/is a major art event that spawned art, music, clothing and a mystique unmatched by anything else contemporary. Perhaps the mania associated with Doyle's ""Sherlock Holmes"" newspaper articles was the last time such fervor was associated with the printed word. Adding confusing plots, tired movie clichés and CGI, do not substitute for character development and the unfolding of plot ideas. Another thing and that is about stereotypes: why can't back actors/actresses just be part of the regular crew and characters? In ""Matrix"" we had a black Oracle. Here we have a black witch who turns out to be a demon. Why can't a black guy be the ingénue's frustrated love interest? what is is about middle age black women that shouts ""WITCH?"" Don't they get menopausal like every other human woman? Why do they have to have extra curricular motives in the movie? I find this kind of myopia interesting in the film industry. It is nice to know that there are bands of Werewolves who just hang around like supernatural SWAT teams waiting for a call to bare teeth and set out on a quest of which they magically know all the details before they set out. I forgot about the incest scene. Ricard Wagner did this about 150 years ago? The discovery that a love interest is a brother/sister. The ingénue finds out and what does she say? ""That was when he was Jase."" How mature of a young girl and how totally ridiculous. I have raised daughters and even the thought that one deep kissed a guy who turned out to be her bother would drive her to wash out her mouth with gasoline and then a request for immediate therapy. Not one would have the maturity to state that it was OK because: ""I thought he was someone else."" What a joke. They would be more likely to state that they were grossed out beyond belief and get sick to their stomach.I could go on but why bother.

91,ihatespike,Emptier than a rain barrel in the desert.,1,17 February 2014,"Oh dear-where to start?This is an adaptation from a pretty lame book series, but I honestly didn't expect the movie to be that bad. I gave it a clean slate before I watched it and even I was astounded at how awful it was. I actually feel bad for the fans of the books!The characters are flat, lifeless and uninteresting, the bad guys don't have any discernible motivation (except that they're ""evil"". Wow. Deep.) The protagonist (when she stops mimicking a plank of wood and manages to invoke ANY emotional response) is a catty Mary-Sue with inexplicable powers, and her love interest is a huffy little man-child who looks like he just got over three weeks of the flu and a heroin addiction. The dialogue is unforgivably wooden and laughably bad (if you can overcome the pain of its total lack of verisimilitude), the magical world we're introduced to is poorly defined and filled with more holes than a pin-cushion, the secondary characters feel like props set up to highlight the story's romance which falls egregiously flat, the bad guy pops out of nowhere, monologues wretchedly about his in-no-way-clear evil plan, the heroes run around having hot-topic fashion disaster fights, and the movie lumbers to a halt and vomits the credits at you.I know it's trendy to hurry up and turn a popular YA story into a movie, but this movie may actually have been assembled while the cast and crew rode a waterslide, it felt that rushed.Simple movies are fun, adventure movies are fun, romance and action and magic are just plain fun. This movie is a trainwreck, and trainwrecks are never fun.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
92,zach-tiefling,Better than the novel. And believe me that doesn't say much...,2,27 October 2014,"The general consensus is, that you can't translate a book into a movie, without doing some major cuts to the source material... except maybe you have Peter Jackson and a couple hundred million dollar at your disposal, then you might get just close enough to appease most of the fans.I have read the novel ""The City of Bones"" a few months back, so I am able say how both incarnations of this story deviate from each other. If you now expect the old ""the novel is better""-spiel, then you are wrong. The book is a boring, utterly predicable and badly written mess, with the main character being as proactive as a rusty doorknob. It even made me question my principle to always finish what I start reading... but you are not here for a book-review. Interestingly enough, translating ""City of Bones"" into a movie has resulted in turning the unwritten laws of movie-adaptions upside down: The cuts and changes that were applied to the movie version, actually benefit the story and I am fully aware how strange this must sound. Furthermore, trimming down the dialogue has made the characters more bearable (or less insufferable). What was long and boring in the book, has transformed to (just) a rushed sequence of scenes, that push the plot forward. The movie is trying to hurry from scene to scene, in order to hit all important bits from the book. This also causes the problem, that many scene-transitions feel disjointed: ""We are in scene A! Now we need to get to scene B! Let us show the reason why we have to go from A to B, either at the very end of scene A or deliver exposition at the beginning of scene B.""...which isn't that much of a problem, because it at least spares you the 'bumbling around' the characters do in the book. The viewer has also much less time to notice the fivehundred-or-so of plot-holes in this story. However, things that had been at least 'somewhat established' in the book, now come right out of nowhere (and sometimes lead nowhere), other plot-points feel 'wrong' in a different way. Speaking of 'wrong', even if you don't get the least bit invested in this movies love-triangle, I guarantee you, that you will feel the urge to rub your brain clean, when this sub-plot concludes in the end. ( This particular bit is even WORSE in the book, since there you could guess 'the big plot twist' half-way through the book. ) Acting is passable. CGI is a mixed bag. Characters are not memorable at all -except maybe Simon - just like in the book. If you think too hard about it, the plot barely makes any sense - except you assume the main-villain, did not even met the requirements for the position as 'Cobra Commander' - just like in the book. The action is hard to follow, just like in the book.The dialogue is more or less a vessel for exposition, just like in the book. The plot-twits will either make you laugh, cringe or quoting a certain space opera, just like in the book. But at least the main-protagonist feels a bit more proactive.And NO, the book doesn't give you a explanation, why it is called ""City of Bones"", either.Conclusion: Yet another adaption of a YA novel, which wasn't even readable to begin with.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
93,MeMyselfOnline,The Mortal Instruments: City of Loose Ends,4,27 August 2013,"LOTS OF SPOILERSI've seen many a movie that's chock full of plot holes, but I've seen few that have as many loose ends and stupid decisions as this one.Off the top of my head and without having to really rack my brains very much, these are those which immediately spring to mind:* Near the beginning, why did Clary's mother lock herself into the only room of the house without an exit? Every other Shadowhunter can level up against armies of creatures seemingly single-handedly, yet this one seems only able to cower in a bathroom with a mobile phone in one hand and a frying pan in the other.* Why make an obvious scene out of Simon having a vampire bite if they weren't going to take it anywhere? Wouldn't Clary have asked someone if there was something that could be done? No, she just shrugs it off, thankful that her only lifelong friend no longer needs to waste money on glasses or contact lenses.* Why make a point of getting Clary to check Simon's mobile, so she can get all annoyed about him not taking her mother's call for help - and then not take it anywhere?* There you are, trapped, with dozens of demons beating down the door - the end is nigh! But wait! You use your Magic Marker to draw a 'Freeze, Demons, Freeze!' rune, saving the day. Well, you would have saved the day if you'd killed them whilst frozen. Instead, you just tip-toe past them all so that it can wear off and then all your saviours get butchered.* When Clary realised where the Cup was hidden and returned to the witch, why did half of them go upstairs and tip iron filings all over the floor? It was never explained and never developed. Just another needless and pointless scene.* Why did Alec react so badly to Clary's accusation regarding Jase? Again, it went absolutely nowhere.* Speaking of Alec, how did Bane know to turn up at the institute and why did no-one so much as ask him how he knew to turn up, and what he was going to be able to do to help? * Jase warns Clary that it takes years and years to properly attune your mind to use the portal. Yet she can seemingly dive head first into the magic puddle and end up just around the corner, within walking distance. Who knew that 'limbo' would be in the same zip code? Well I never...* Apparently, if you wish to summon an unholy army of demons - make sure you leave the skylight open. You know how fussy those demon sorts are about getting some fresh air upon arrival.I could go on but it's suffice to say that I wasn't impressed and thought the film was just plain bad. And it didn't help that there seemed to be no clear antagonist. If Valentine was meant to play that role, then why make the demons the things that everyone is fighting. Who are the 'good guys' meant to be fighting against? Who's working against them? The vampires? The demons? Valentine? The film held my attention for around 30 minutes but after that it was all downhill, and from the vampire nest onwards it had lost me entirely. The rest was just a painfully long bore-fest that just wouldn't stop.If they're stupid enough to make a sequel to this twaddle, I won't be stupid enough to go to watch it.4/10",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
94,isabelle-frater,Slightly worse than the book,5,29 August 2013,"I went to this movie after reading mixed reviews about it. Though there were mixed reviews about the books as well, and those I liked. Okay, the first three. I haven't read on, as I felt it should have ended there. Moving on... When I watch a movie that is based on a book, I don't try to compare it to the book too much. They are two different mediums, and something that may work in a book, doesn't work in a movie. What is important is for the movie to give back the main story line of the book, the feel of the book, and to stand on its own, so that people who don't read the books understand it as well.The story line I had a problem with. Partly, because I read the book over a year ago, and I don't remember much of it. I'm pretty sure the end was different, but that I understand because of the time. They did commit a major sin though. They revealed a very important plot point, in fact, I think more than one, that doesn't get revealed until the next book. They did stick to it mostly, but still... The feel was great. Seriously, I came out of the theater pumped up, and that is always a good thing. I saw the world as if I was still in the movie. That may not be that good. It can stand on its own for the most part. There were some things that I knew from the book, that was a bit problematic in the movie. For example, the people living at the Institute. Who they were wasn't explained well. I would have liked them to be properly introduced. Maybe it was a time issue, or a flow issue, but really, how long would it take to say ""Hi, I'm Isabelle, this is Alec, my brother."" or something to that effect. We basically don't know anything about anyone, just Carly. All the back stories that they may have is missing. It's implied, but I only caught snippets. That was a negative. The rest of the plot is explained well, can be understood without the book.The look of the movie was great. The Institute I loved, the demons looked properly hideous, the fight scenes were reasonably exciting. The soundtrack was also really good. I generally don't pay much attention to the music, but that was a huge plus in this one. I especially liked one fight scene music, so I'm definitely getting the soundtrack.Now on to the cast. I must say, pretty good. Lily Collins I first noticed in Mirror, Mirror, where I thought how better she was at being Snow White than Kristen Stewart. She was a very believable Carly too. I look forward to seeing her in more movies, I think she'll be great. Jamie Campbell Bower was properly hot and dark as Jace. I didn't have a clear picture of Jace in my head, but it would have been something like him. I was very glad when he was cast, I always thought he was wasted as the young Grindelwald. Kevin Zegers as Alec was a bit of a let-down. I just imagined Alec as a lot more imposing figure somehow. A bit like a darker, more muscular Jace. It was especially a let-down, because I always liked Alec. Some people say Godfrey Gao didn't fit the bill of Magnus. I actually imagined him to be uglier somehow. It was a bit of a pleasant surprise, because I found Godfrey very cute. Therefore, although he didn't fit my Magnus either, I'd rather have him. Aidan Turner I didn't recognize at first, although I watched Being Human. I knew I had seen him somewhere, but because of all the hair, he was playing Luke, it was hard. He didn't have a major role in the movie, I hope he'll get more story next time. I always thought Luke was a good character. Casting Jared Harris as Hodge is a bit of a give-away. I won't say more. Spoilers.Overall, it was a good movie. Watchable. I may even re-watch it in a few months on a bored Sunday. People can take their boyfriends or girlfriends to it as well, and they will probably have a good time too. I do wish it was less show, more story, but the fight scenes were pretty cool. If someone likes the story, they should read the book though. If someone read the book, try to leave your outrage over the little things behind, and just immerse yourself in the sights. That is why this gets 5 stars. Slightly worse than the book.Cross-posted at http://unapologetic-reviews.blogspot.com",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones

96,sim-richmond,Bonny City of Bones,8,14 October 2014,"As opposed to the general criticisms thrown at the movie, I actually find it really awesome. Indeed, it has been way too far from the book from where the movie's plot was lifted; but I guess those changes were necessary to improve the storyline to give the audience a more exciting viewing experience. The maneuver was totally mastered which gives an intense feeling for the viewers as they watch through a very mysterious battle between allegorical creatures.The special effects were cool enough to satisfy me, but I think it would have been improved much better had the producers decided to be very meticulous on the small details in crossing the t's and dotting the i's. This way, the scenes of reverie would have appeared more pragmatic whilst remaining to seem realistic.The music was definitely fascinating. It tickles my ears as I watch through every series of scenes because of it's wonderful composition. I think it really suits the motion picture that it harmonizes with, making the use of it really effective into bringing the rightful emotions with the audience.On the other hand, the cinematography was good enough although I think it was just a bit above average. As a fantasy movie, it would have been more effective if they used more aerial views and continuous above-the-eye-level shots. However, I really would like to comment whoever the cinematographer is for not creating pirouette bewildering groggy-causing shots. Typical delusion films would prefer to create whirl shots which causes dizziness among the viewers. Going against is a laudable thing.The acting of the actors were also great. They were acting really natural and it is noticeable that they have proper characterization for the movie characters. Nevertheless, a little overacting would have intensified the scenes. I mean, their faces were very brave-looking that causes a comfort for the audience knowing that the characters would win against all odds. For me, showing a little emotion of fear would sharpen the edges.Overall, the movie was great and I think it deserves an 8/10.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
97,aimtrain1021,"Brief summary of books, no character development",3,5 December 2020,"I have only just recently been reading this series and on Book 5, so I decided to try this movie. Like most book-to-movie adaptations it was missing real character development and came across more like an overview of the events in the first book. The pace was quicker, so you couldn't really feel for any of the characters. The books are long so there is a lot more that happens, more dialogue, more moments tying all the leads together. Also, the books are a lot wittier and give a better world development as far as NY goes. Jace's character in the books is a lot ruder and cocky, especially to Simon. Also, not sure this actor was a good fit appearance wise. Isabelle's character is more lively in the books. Magnus wasn't in the movie much and his character in books is also more interesting.It's rare to have a movie be acceptable after a book, with the right characters. Hunger Games did a decent job of this, give or take a few differences, but I can still watch the movies and enjoy them.This wasn't total trash, but the books are better as always.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
98,barendbkj,Satisfied...But JACE!!!!!,7,25 September 2013,"Okay so I read all five of the books in a week...it is one of the best series out there. I think that Cassandra Clare is defiantly the best author out there today.When I found out they were making it into a movie the first question I asked who are they going to get to play Jace? Lilly Collins was perfect, her voice fit Clary, her acting, her walking everything was Clary. Magnus was awesome as always...Alec was awesome and Isabelle was amazing. And Simon was just as good.Jaime Campbell Bower did not lack anything in the acting department. It was only the scenes were he really had to give it that he couldn't bring it. Jace is supposed to be a younger Chris Hemsworth...Jace Herondale is out of all the fictional characters I have experienced the one I as a guy look up to the most. I just wished they would've looked a little longer. He really wasn't the right one. Sorry for those who think different.But over all everything was true to the book with a few more twists, like the part where they hang Simon form those cables was freaking intense. But the rest was right, Magnus's charm, Isabelle's attitude and Luke's protectiveness.Those who have not yet read the book will find this amazing, but those who have I think will find it satisfying, but not amazing and as awesome as the books...But way better than Twilight (okay anything is better than Twilight) and a franchise I'm really excited about. Can't wait for the rest just hope Jamie hits the gym and buff up to get to the standards he didn't meet as much as he should've...",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
99,brooke_gaylene,Movie was fine in my opinion. :),6,1 February 2014,"Movie was fine and entertaining.I'm not going to give lots of details about what happened in the movie but just wanted to comment about what a lot of other people had said about it.It feels like much of the hate must be from people trying to just buck the trend or with some emotional spur of the moment thing going on lol. Some people gave it 1 star which... according to them... makes it one of the worst movies ever made (worse than Battlefield Earth, or Killing Spree?? lol), but there are a lot of 10 star ratings... (So it was as good as The Godfather, Shawshank Redemption, Pulp Fiction etc??)... too which always makes you think they were people involved with the movie but then again maybe people rate them in on their expectations of the movie compared to what they actually get, rather than rating in comparison to other movies?It had a budget of $60 million and box office was around $76 million most likely way down on what they though it would be but not exactly a big flop, yeah there was probably millions spent on promoting but they probably made up for that and more with DVD and BR sales and rentals, and looking through various sites, the critics reviews seem to be around average or just below and cinema goers reviews seem to be average to above average. At the time of typing this it has a 6.1 rating on IMDb which shows that most here think it is at least better than average.This movie is about getting to know the characters, an intro into the series if you like, there will be loose ends because there will be at least one sequel. The next movie will be much the same plus developing the characters with a big finale or if there is a 3rd and final movie the big finale will be there, that is usually how it works. There will always be similarities and comparisons... (Twighlight, Harry Potter, Stargate, Underworld... whatever!)... to other movies when especially when they are in the same genre, it would be almost impossible to make the movie 100% unique.As for always comparing movies with books people will nearly always prefer the 1st version of something they read, see, hear etc which most often than not is the original, whether it be a book, movie, TV series or music. Its pointless reading the book and then moaning that it is not as the same. Making it exactly the same... which is hard anyway across the two completely different formats... would be also pointless as once you have read or seen one then there would be no point reading or seeing the other and people would still moan because its the same.I agree it was a little too long and also agree with someone who mentioned the film score, it does seem somewhat out of place, like it was taken from another movie plus a lot of scenes were too dark, not much point spending money on filming a scene that no-one can see, but over all it was fine and entertaining. :)BTW Took me a while to recognise Robert Sheehan, he was funny in Misfits TV series. :)",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
100,Bello-4,A Really Great Movie Despite What The Critics Say...,7,26 August 2013,"Spoilers possible during the course of this review, you've been warned...After reading up in Wikipedia about this movie I wasn't expecting much. But after viewing another movie at the same theater I was able to see The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones and was really surprised. Despite what the critics had to say, I thought it was a really good movie... It was well shot, wasn't very much at all sappy, not to violent, and as a story held together well enough despite a couple of things.Those couple of things are (spoilers) - 1) That the heroine Clary doesn't recognize that her male friend whom she see's akin to a brother is actually in love with her? That the guy whom she becomes attracted to and even kisses, we find out later in the movie could very well be the brother she never knew she had (which being slightly incestuous aside, is just a weak plot device in both film and book from which the movie is taken). 2) The villain, Valentine, wasn't as intimidating as I would've thought the way the characters were telling of him to Clary.Lily Collins is a beautiful site to look at and also a standout performer. Quickly taking the title of Hollywood's new ""it"" girl, she does the film justice with her abilities. She really rocked her role in this movie and any of her fans will not be disappointed.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
101,aequitas_veritas_007,"Solid Acting, Terrible Story, Horrible Style",5,28 December 2013,"The sets and production quality of this movie are very good, and leave little to be desired. The majority of actors and actresses gave very good performances despite an incredibly weak script. The harsh, rough, almost cheap TV-esque story (almost like the same writers than did Vampire Diaries) seem completely focused towards a young teen audience instead of young adults like it should be. Clichéd lines, delivered as best each actor could muster, still didn't quite pay out. The style of the movie lacked originality as well. Twilight meets Blade much? The costume designers could have done much more than this final product. I believe the tattooed, wearing black leather, emo-ish look has,had its day. That being said, I am sure that plenty of 15 year olds and under will really enjoy this. Any older than that, just watch something else. Overall 5/10 and I will not be buying this on DVD.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
102,tomhg38,A little too much twilight.,5,9 October 2013,"This movie isn't offensively bad. The world it depicts is fairly interesting with hints at a rich tapestry of supernatural creatures lying at the edges of the plot.Sadly it yearns so badly to capture the enormous market of twilight it sabotages itself at every turn. The young girl with bold eyebrows who is for various reasons intensely desired by just about everyone in the film does very little in terms of justifying her high valuation. She is stalked by two males who fight for her affection (i do really like Sheehan from his work on misfits) do so in a twilight-esque fashion that feels shoehorned in.This feeling comes from the outset by everyone around the young girl pointing out the best friend has intense desires for her, for which she is oblivious even though he appears to be her only friend, and later by effeminate boy who saves her life. These two characters literally walk in on each other ""making a move"" multiple times.The end result of the movie is you feel like you watched a pilot for an even cheaper The Vampire Diaries in which any real story line is stymied by a desire to have as much teen angst love triangle as possible with the handful of characters that they have cast in the movie, turning 2 hours of screen time into a rushed and thin storyline.If you go to a supernatural movie like this wanting rich story telling of a supernatural awakening you will be disappointed, if you want action packed scenes of an ancient order fighting off evil monsters you will be disappointed. If you want crumbs of the above littered with adolescent flirting and can overlook some weak acting and plot then this is the movie for you!I personally feel the 1 girl 2 moron supernatural scene has had its day, can we move back to epic fantasy sagas like lord of the rings yet? please...",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones

For example, in the book, Simon gets turned into a rat, bits Raphel and slowly turns - he doesn't get bitten by a vampire like in the film.The cast is perfect, especially Lily Collins as Clary and Jamie Campbell Bower as Jace. I did think Isabelle was wrong - she was not at all how I pictured her having read the books. Also, Valentine looks completely different in the film than how he was described in the book.

It is a film many fans have anticipated, and it's finally here! I feel like I have had a baby because I have been waiting nine months to see the film! I went to the premiere and was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this!The film version of The Mortal Instruments is a well made supernatural fantasy thriller that captures the beauty of Clare's extraordinary and unique Shadowhunter world. It boasts a brilliant cast, great action sequences, dark cinematography, and a strong witty script. It is actually not a simple film, as you can tell from this rather extensive and complex review where I have attempted to shed light at some of the films intricacies. So, as one of the film's stars Jamie Campbell Bower would say in his English accent, grab yourself a cup of tea (or a cappuccino with an angelic rune design in it), relax, and have a read!Clarissa ""Clary"" Fray (Lily Collins) is the empowered female protagonist at the center of the story. She is an artistically gifted teen living with her single mother Jocelyn (Lena Headey) in New York City.

Isabelle's and Simon's fight scene with the demonic ravens. it felt like a useless filler. it was boring. 2. the revelation who Clary's father and brother are. it was like: ""the big surprise-ending is coming, but don't be afraid - its just an evil lie."" it destroyed the shocking effect that the book had and, again, made it boring.anyway, i'd recommend watching it and i'm looking forward to the sequel.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones

113,scorp76,Don't hate for the sake of popularity.,7,19 November 2013,"Spoilers Ahead:Some people seem to hate this film just because it is a teen flick. In actuality I found fairly entertaining especially since it was over 2 hours long.So I am not not gonna rehash the story but comment on things I saw and the things I got when watching The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones.1: Clary is a very confused girl that craved normality. Being the subject of mind wiping or brainwashing you kind of expect her seek normality that she was programmed to her entire life. Having lost her mother you will see moments of judgment lapse due to the extreme circumstances that occur around at such a short period of time and her inexperience of youth.2: Jace is a conflicted guy, he hates himself. He hates himself because he is looking for companionship and he father has taught him that was a sign of weakness. His emotional outbursts and loftiness are all conflicts of his desires, conditioning and automatic defence to emotional pain.3: Many aspects of the movie's multitude of monsters are not clearly explained because Clary herself is not interested and just want to get things done. So if Clary is not interested to expected the writers and direct to do expositions just to feel you in when they have already more or less told the audience that general pop culture concerning these monsters are correct to the story itself.4: Weapons that the Shadowhunters carry are specific killing demons as that is what their Order does. Red crystals tattoo runes while the blue ones are enhanced with multiple spells for field work which only works when they make contact with an object like the red ones.5: Clary has demon blood in her, hence the rune that can freeze demons. Her daddy-yo wanted her to drink his blood from the Immortal cup so that it can further infuse and enhance her powers in attempt to further put Shadowhunters on the same playing field as Angels I guess.6: Werewolves although somewhat menacing in the second act of the show are not the werewolves of True Blood or any other of your favourite monster romance/drama show. Like the vampires they are generally weak especially compared to a demon. Which is why you heard of them scream they didn't bring equipment to stand toe to toe with demons. If half- angels need crystal swords and fire to deal with demons what good do you think tooth and claw is then?Overall, when watching The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones just take it as you see it. I know some people will say that they need more info but really do you really when a movie to stop at every new monster or ability and start explaining what it is? Just sit back and let your mind escape.I gave it an extra 1/2 star just for the haters.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
114,blossoms-733-387580,"Great Book, Terrible Movie",2,2 September 2013,"Words escape me... As a fan of the Mortal Instruments book series I had expected a much better film than this. Cassandra Clare may not be Annie Proulx, but she is an engaging writer who can spin a good yarn and can keep readers riveted in her world of shadowhunters. Unfortunately, it seems that the producers of this movie decided that YA fiction fans aren't intelligent or sentient enough to know the difference between good and bad acting or well-written and lousy scripts. The film's pacing is terrible, acting mistakes that should have gotten more takes made it into final production, the different scenes pieced together don't tell a coherent story, and the most egregious, unforgivable sin of all is that the film is not true to the book (the director needs to take a lesson from Peter Jackson). In one scene, the shadowhunters arrive at the warlock Magnus's party. When Simon drinks the blue liquid he should have turned into a rat and been mistakenly taken to Dumort by a vampire who thought he was one of them. The biggest deviation from the book was that Valentine is a stranger to Jace. In the book Jace recognizes Valentine as his father, Michael Wayland, who had raised him from childhood and died in front of his eyes (which led to Jace being sent to the Lightwoods). Michael Wayland is somehow miraculously alive and Jace joyously reunites with his father only to discover later that 'Michael Wayland' is actually Valentine Morgernstern. This film deviates so much from the books that I don't know how they're going to piece this bad mess together into a coherent story in the second film ""City of Ashes"". And if ""Ashes"" gets as many crappy reviews, I'll be saving my money for The Hobbit.Hollywood, when are you going to learn that women and girls--the series' primary fanbase--are a powerful and wealthy demographic capable of filling your coffers with millions of dollars? And if you do realize this already why do you think you can give us lousy movie adaptations and expect us to clap like monkeys and throw our money at you? It's extremely insulting how you continue to belittle and disrespect female audiences and still think you're entitled to our hard-earned dollars.There are enough male fantasies being played out in theaters, in the form of Spider-Man, Superman, Marvel Avengers, and giant robots battling in the oceans--to name a few. But there are comparatively far fewer female fantasies out in theaters. And when they are shown they're often belittled, disparaged, and ridiculed. But I have to question the sanity of anyone who thinks some macho Marvel comic hero with a fragile ego and countless notches on his bedpost (Ironman) is a better character than a nice, ordinary girl who discovers she has great supernatural powers and who grows in maturity and strength in the course of the story. I like the second type of character, as embodied by Clary Fray, much more. So, why not invest more in her story?",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones

The movie was more like the book; storyline and characters. I have always been able to separate book from movie/series. After all they say ""based on ........"" for a reason. Yes, while reading the books images of the series do pop up and I visualize the actors from the series as the ones in the book. The older version of them just seems to fit better than the young teens. Even in the movie they chose to go with the older look. Of course having seen the series and read the book the movie was easy to follow. Not so much without previous knowledge. Being able to compare the three was an advantage and a joy. Leaving one out is like leaving part of the story out. I strongly recommend the movie, however watch it with an open mind.

My wife and daughter were out shopping Saturday, and they called me at 7 to say, ""Hey, can you be at the theater by 7:30? We're going to see a movie and want you to come join us."" So, I put the dogs away, washed the paint off my arms, and drove like hell - to the wrong theater!

But as the movie started, I found myself quite enjoying it! The story, which obviously juvenile, was paced well and the mystery of who (and what) Clary is was well done.And, let me just say this - Lily Collins was radiant in this movie. And Lena Headey, as always, is a joy to watch in any movie although they don't give her much to do in this.So, the first act of the movie, as Clary is figure out who and what she is was well done. The second act, was beginning to become more of a CGI fest, but it was still well done. The huge fight scene when they were in the dining hall of the Hotel was done well. I was actually feeling a little tense for the good guys and wondering how they were going to get out of it.The last act - the huge battle and the appearance of the villain is where the movie really started to drag. It went on too long, it didn't really make a lot of sense at times, and the whole ""is he or isn't he"" thing just didn't come well.I actually checked my watch during the battle - always a sure sign that the movie is losing my attention.But, based on the first two acts and disarmingly way young Ms. Collins carried this film well on her shoulders, I still think it's worth a 7 and should be a fairly solid bit of entertainment for anyone not feeling jaded by the whole Twilight thingy.Just imagine if Lily Collins had been the star of the Twilight series - I might have watched more than 2 of them!",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones

NO.This is a horrible adaptation. It's in the vicinity of ""Eragon bad.""I am not lying. If you're asking yourself, ""should I watch this movie?"" the answer is NO. There's nothing to gain. If you generally like bad movies, then feel free, (sometimes you just get the urge for a stinker, this is fact), but otherwise - avoid. The writing is atrocious. The direction is atrocious. Some of the lines will crawl your blood, even if you're the youngest most movie-naive teenage girl in existence. There are scenes that'll make you feel embarrassed for the actors. I'm serious. There is this one scene that is so cheesy... I can't even describe it, but it's like all the cheese and all the corny from all five twilight movies condensed into 30-45 seconds.This makes the Twilight Saga look worthy of an Academy Award. Every single joke falls flat. Every single one. Jace is supposed to be the witty one, and he's supposed to have this banter-prone persona - he doesn't. This Jace is almost shy. The dialogue is horrendous. The clichés hit you so hard you start thinking it's a parody halfway through, (it isn't). Geezus. The Tudors king guy is in it, but he can't save it. I think his appearance was the proverbial nail, in fact. The end is almost incomprehensible as you just lose yourself in a storm of clichés. The movie's plot contradicts all logic and all pathways of common sense, and I'm not exaggerating here.Now, I grant that the source material wouldn't win any awards either. There won't be any Team Jace or Team Simon T shirts on sale. Not sure how many Clary fans there are in the world, but I'd guess, not much because the original book characters are not the best characters ever. The book's plot isn't the most original thing ever. The books themselves are crap, being honest, but they're tolerable crap. This movie takes that crap and makes crap soup with it. They bring the crap to a boil. They season it... All the better to bring out that smoky crap flavour. Movie adaptations seldom ever are better than the book, (and I count LOTR as the only exception), but when the bar was set this low, you have to ask ""How did they F''' this up?"" They had a decent cast. Decent acting too... It's just the writing! It's like the first draft of a screenplay that gets hammered out in a dark latrine while the writer is suffering from food poisoning. Who approves this stuff? Really. Who signed off on this as a good idea. Somewhere along the way, while this movie was being made, someone should have said NO. I feel like this movie should have some controversy to it. Someone should have stormed off the set. I feel like drugs were involved? Maybe? Mindblowingly bad. The opposite of epic. Painful and embarrassing to watch. Hands down the worst movie of the year.And there's going to be a sequel? NO. Say NO, people. Just say NO.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
121,andysfatpants,Cute teen fantasy film,8,23 April 2019,"I'm an adult who happened to catch this film on cable TV, having no prior knowledge of the books or storyline.Others have compared it to Twilight and Percy Jackson. It definitely falls into that field, so if that's your jam, then I think you'll enjoy it! As long as your expectations are realistic for what you're gonna get.PROS:
1. Fun fantasy world with a variety of mythical creatures.
2. Attractive cast of young adults has good chemistry.
3. Moved at a decent pace, plenty of action.
4. Family friendly for teens. I didn't notice any vulgar language or sex scenes (some kissing and skimpy clothing, but nothing pornographic). There was violence amongst human actors and special effects creatures.CONS:
1. Script could have been better. Some moments where the character's choices, actions, or words seemed stupid, nonsensical, or cheesy.
2. You jump straight away into a world with a variety of mythical creatures and you don't quite understand how all the creatures interact within the world. It's a little unclear, but you're still able to watch and follow the story as more information unfolds.
3. Special effects were generally decent. One thing that could have been improved - the characters had tattoo-like ""runes"" on their bodies. They create them using a device to burn them into their flesh, but later they turn into black makeup that washes off with water? That seemed a little corny to me.Overall, I would watch this film again. It was fun, easy entertainment, non-offensive.If you hate cheesy teen films like Twilight and Percy Jackson then it's not for you.And if you're one of those obsessive film critics who likes picking movies apart then there are plenty of imperfections here for you to revel in.Enjoy!",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones

But I squirmed in my seat for the entirety of the two hours. The whole 'incest' part was too much for me. :/I thought that the plot was interesting and I would have loved the movie, in my mind I was grossed out. The movie didn't need some Twilight romance crap. It was good as it was and I would have enjoyed it if not for the created romance drama. The vampires were awesome and Lily Collins was surprisingly good. The main male actor with the blond hair was just... Very aesthetically pleasing. But, the movie is worth watching.

125,pierce-declase,A 1 time watch movie,4,14 January 2014,"Story- The story is very basic, you can already tell what is going to happen. Which is not the most interesting plot, it does have some good elements in it but overall it does not appeal to me. Since this is a one time movie there is really is no development in the story. Nothing special happens.Characters- Well we have the main character Clary who at the start does not know anything. Eventually everything unfolds to her. Her best friend is we can all tell is in love with her Simon. The other character is Jace who finds Clary and helps are transcend into this whole new experience. Now you can see there is a love triangle formed here which is really poor and boring. There is hardly any character development or emotion. Some other characters are pretty cool but there is really nothing special about anything of them.Action- There is not much action other than the one when they fight vampires, that was the only good thing about the movie. The end fight is pretty boring and your sitting there hooping the movie will end. Overall the movie was not the worse but really did not enjoy it. Its a 1 time watch movie for me but others may enjoy it. It does have cool affects which all i can really give it. First review so do not judge",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
126,karinafaolin,Best and Worst Casting Ever,8,6 February 2016,"In comparison to other movies based on dystopia-ish teen books, this one is probably the best. Unlike Divergent and Maze Runner, there was an actual story in this other than mindless fighting that breaks the laws of physics. Story-wise, this movie deserves a 6/10. It was watchable. And unlike when I watched Divergent and Maze Runner, none of my brain cells died from dealing with boredom and stupidity. But what brought this movie up from a 6 to an 8 for me, was the casting. In some ways, this was the worse casting ever, in that whoever casted it had no concept of age. I mean, you really want me to believe a man born in 1977 spawned a kid born in 1988? But all that aside, OMG EVERY CHARACTER IN THIS MOVIE WAS UNBELIEVABLY GORGEOUS!!! So I'm watching this, at at the first scene I'm just ogling over Luke. And then I'm ogling over Jace, and Alec. And my male friends were just sitting there drooling over Clary. Whoever did the casting for Magic Mike should take a lesson and cast these hotties instead of the fugly druggies they casted in Magic Mike.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
127,halils6959,Sad but True,5,9 March 2015,"Well, I have to admit I read the book(s), and to be honest, they were a good way to past time while traveling from city to city, airport to airport (that's my job actually); and OK, they were not the best books in history but very few rarely can be anyways. So, I was wondering how they would turn the story into a mess (was sure it was going to be as always), and they really did it with great precision and skill..The film doesn't even cover half the book, half the story and the story is not even the same. Valentine drank demon blood from the cup when he was 17, was doing ceremonial demon rituals and so on. What a great twist for the readers of the book. And what about the ""caricatured"" Blackcwell..! The flow of the movie is crippled and looks like a crazy person's inconsistent and erratic camp fire story. They really did not want to shoot the second one for sure, and I can't help but think that this is intentional.Just a quick example. Well you know Avatar the movie (not the cartoon but the blue alien story). You may like it or not, but for most of the people, the flight ""learning"" part and the scenes in the air were exhilarating to be honest. And there were similar ones here in this book which could turn in to fine scenes if they were worked on thoroughly. But instead of that, what did the producers do? They cut them, acted like nothing happened with the bikes and completely removed them from the plot. And believe me, this is just a small tiny example. It is sad but true unfortunately.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones

The characters were very weak and they seemed to pop out randomly and their introduction is jarring to the storytelling.Didn't know that this was an adaptation of a book (books?). Maybe the book made more sense.The characters are so Irritatingly angsty that it made me think I was watching a teen movie. It was the intrusive dramatic music that suddenly played somewhere at the beginning of the move that screamed teen angst movie.Some of the actors in this movie seemed to have given better acting work in previous movies they were in and seemed like they just coasted along with this film.Dialogue made me cringe.I could polish this review before I press ""publish"" but why would I?

129,smitty008,Not to my liking,4,19 November 2019,"This movie uses the age old formula of trying to take the best features out of successful movies and make one glorious movie. To my knowledge that recipe has never worked and it doesn't work here. The list of works sampled in this one is long, but I'll give it a try; I saw elements of Harry Potter, Star Wars, The Hunger Games, Ghostbusters, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Twilight, X-Men, some eighties vampire movie that I don't remember the name of, and throw in a dose of Days of our Lives to top it off. The whole movie was like watching little kids pretend to be superheroes and inventing powers as needed to get out of whatever situation they happened to be in.Lilly Collins looks like she should be acting in soap operas and not as the lead character of an action/adventure flick, Jamie Campbell Bower's character is exactly like you'd expect a guy named Jamie Campbell Bower to be, and any time Robert Sheehan was on screen I seemed to be annoyed with his character.Additionally, I hadn't even heard of this book series prior to watching the movie. Please, Mr. Producer Man/Ms. Producer Woman, don't assume I'm walking into your movie with any knowledge at all as to what's going on. And don't expect me to be reading the book while watching the movie to get whatever reference you are trying to push. I spent a lot of time wondering what the heck was going on and why these people always seemed to be making decisions that were highly counter-intuitive.All in all, I wouldn't classify it as a complete waste of time, but darned close.

If you like Harry Potter then see this film, I am not a huge fan of Harry Potter so I was surprised I liked it so much.The only point I would say is that some people might find it hard to follow and some parts are a little bit jumpy nearer the end but if the story wasn't complicated then the movie wouldn't have been as good.This film has romance but is does not go over the top, is has action, suspense, thrill, adventure, a little bit Sic-Fi and mystery.

Although, i must admit that i haven't read the book...Anyways, I thought it was a very entertaining movie. Nice set. I find the whole story and concept interesting. It's very unique in these times of teenage movies about vampires, zombies and post-apocalyptic/post-war themes with twilight, the hunger games, divergent etc. Sure it has a few of those elements, but it's still a bit different. And sure the script is a bit cheesy and it has some flaws, but I don't mind it. After all, the movie is mainly made for teenage girls who loves cheesy stuff, and not old, bitter professional movie critics.The actors were great as well. I'm personally a big fan of Kevin Zegers, Lily Collins, Robert Sheehan and Jamie Campell Bower. I think they did a great job.I look forward to the next movie and i hope it will be even better.

132,PassengerB,A very underappreciated adaptation that is truer to the books than the TV series,9,28 December 2017,"- - This review may contain a few minor spoilers - - - In my opinion this is quite a fantastic adaptation of Cassandra Clare's first book in the The Mortal Instrument series. 
It's fast-paced and full of everything that makes Fantasy fun: friendship, betrayal, magical creatures, witches, the struggle between good and evil although those are sometimes not easily identified... Lily Collins - though lacking book-Clary's signature flaming red hair - is a perfect cast for the character of Clary and funnily enough after watching Aidan Turner's performance as a vampire in ""Being Human"" I thought he would be perfect for the role of the werewolf Luke. Cudos to the casting director, he truly found the perfect actor for each role and the chemistry between Clary/Jace and Luke/Jocelyn (even if they got very little screen time together) was superb. 
I also enjoyed that the characters all really had their own distinct voice and personality. Jace's arrogance and hidden vulnerability really came through in Jamie Campbell Bower's performance and the same goes Clary, whose bravery and determination were great fun to watch. You go, girl! All in all this adaptation is pretty true to the books with a few minor changes as those scenes or plot lines would have not translated to the screen too well.
I was impressed by the cinematography and the contrast between modern NYC and the Shadowhunters' medieval kind of world and lifestyle. 
Fortunately the vomit-inducing incest storyline was basically capped from the movie (or at least we know what was what from the get-go unlike in the books).As with most movies this one had a few flaws as well. The screenwriter apparently did NOT understand how the portal worked! Valentine reaching out from beyond it was a cheap horror movie moment that was both point- and senseless. 
What is going to happen with Simon now that he was bitten? This should have been explained. I'm also disappointed they cut one of my favorite characters from the movie: Raphael Santiago. Not that it actually matters since there won't be a second movie unfortunately. 
If you paid attention to the background story/flashback scenes you understood why Valentine was adamant Clary drink his blood from the Mortal Cup but I think this may have been confusing for those who didn't read the books. The same goes for Clary's talent to create runes, which admittedly isn't explained in book #1 but on screen this suddenly appearing talent seemed just like bad writing. They needed to somehow magically turn the tables during the end fight and then voilá, Clary discovers this previously never mentioned or explained talent to save the day. I would have loved to see the original trilogy adapted completely. The TV show is so poorly produced, the acting so sub-par and the entire story only loosely based on the books anymore that I couldn't get through more than a few episodes.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
133,cb400,Could have been better...,6,3 October 2014,"I never read the book so everything was new to me when I was watching this movie. Full of surprises. That is, there were lots of loose ends and lack of character development. It's like it assumed all the viewers knew the characters beforehand. I was lost when Clary accused Alec of being in love with Jace. There was no prior indication that Alec was gay.Jace mentioned at least twice that they are a close team, and Isabelle said that they haven't been working as a team since Clary arrived. But then again, there was no prior scene on how close they were as a team before Clary, and how they were now breaking up.Simon was bitten by a vampire and his vision improved. Just that?Suddenly, a long romantic scene between Jace and Clary. How did they become attracted to each other? There were more questions but too long to write. All in all, I think this could have been a very good movie if it was very well written. Somebody who had no idea about the book should have read the script so that these loose ends were pointed out early on in the production.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
134,colincec,"Poorly written, poorly paced, just poorly put together",2,1 February 2014,"The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones was a huge disappointment, at least until the third act where it became halfway decent. The first two acts were a constant parade of exposition and action scenes with almost no time for character development. On top of that, the pacing, acting (save for the main actress), and script are fairly poor. Plot threads are set up and left dangling, possibly for the sequel or possibly because of the cut source material. Some reviews label it as the next Twilight, but to me it feels like the next Eragon. Twilight at least set time aside for characterization, though admittedly the romantic chemistry is just as bad. There are some redeeming moments, but those can't be discussed for spoiler reasons and they raise even more questions. The least that can be said about it is that it's entertaining, but the truth is that you've seen this movie before and better under many different titles.

BUT! half-way to the movie, and just as i am starting to warming up and the lead couple starts falling in love, the movie turns into cheesy teenager love story. The couple was kissing while a happy, Disney-like, song was playing and sprinklers were soaking them with water, and butterflies were flying all over the place. What was that? I thought i was watching a serious movie. The actors were pretty great, with the sad exception of Bane. He looked the part, but that was about it. I was also a little let down with the way the plot was explained. We didn't get a good explanation about valentine's actions. He wanted to do...what exactly??? And finally, many faces were not introduced in this movie, and a few important scenes (for me) were cut, which makes me wonder about the sequel. All in all, it was not bad but not really good either. It should explain some things better since not everyone has read the book and a movie cannot rely only in readers and i expected it darker and longer. Good scenes were missing.

In actuality, you can't find a reason to care about any of the characters. It's like twilight on drugs. In fact, I rather watch twilight than this. I went to see the film having no idea what it was about or that there was a book. Most people who haven't read a book like the movie adaptation better. Well I certainly hope that the book is better (though I have no intention of reading it). After about an hour of this movie I could take no more. Awful, just awful.

I don't really understand much about this world, but I kinda just went along with it. Left me feeling pretty confused mainly at the end (I was kinda lost on who some of the characters were too).

138,bogdan314,Confusing cocktail of so many clichés,3,14 September 2013,"While watching the movie I had no idea there's a book that it's made after. Now while reading other user reviews I found out about it, and suddenly it becomes clear why this movies is SO BAD!I really can't understand all those people praising the performance, the action etc. Have you people been watching a different movie? Or did you read the book (which I guess was pretty good) and forgot that you must judge the MOVIE not the book?There are so many bad things in this movie I don't know where to start. It's the very first movie that I literally wanted to stop watching after an hour or so. I proposed my girlfriend to leave the cinema earlier but she wanted to see the end.What I noticed about other movies that I'd rate as ""average"", they had plenty of action but where lacking character development. This movie, however, was a complete mess in what regarded action. In the second half of the movie, the scenes were simply coming out of nowhere and with no connections in between. Many things remained unexplained and here-and-there we find out some magic tricks that just don't connect with the story.One major problem is the mixing of so many clichés I was literally saying ""Oh... this too..."" every time a plot twist or a character background detail was revealed. This movie was an UNHAPPY MIX of Twilight/The vampire diaries with some modern fantasy movies (like that one with Nicholas Cage being a wizard, I don't know the name now). In the end it jumped into Star Wars father-son-sister clichés: ""You are my daughter"" (""I am your father"" would have really been TOO MUCH), ""He is your brother"", ""Come with me, son"", brothers kiss before the revelation (interestingly enough, they continue to feel attracted to each other even after they found out), father-son duel, the good father turning bad etc etc. We see the classical vampire/werewolf rivalry, although vampires seem to be very, very weak creatures in this movies. Nearly 100 vampires seem to have no chance facing a handful of humans. In the final battle scenes, I was literally confused as to who was fighting, why and where. I was praying for someone to die and bring the movie to an end.I'm not gonna say anything about ""character development"". It's a long lost art in movie-making and I didn't expect this movie to deliver any sample either.I wasn't expecting, however, to see such poorly done screenplay. Absolutely no realism whatsoever in character reaction. Like, for example, in the beginning, the black witch tells the girl ""Your mother was a Shadow Hunter!"" and she says ""No, she's a paintress""... I mean, come on!! Is that really what you say when someone tells you your mom is some demon hunter??That was just an example among dozens of bad details. The only explanation for the good reviews and such a high grade (6.6 at the moment) must lie in the book's fans...In conclusion: I did have low expectations heading into the movie, but I thought it would be at least decent. It wasn't. Fans of the book will blame me, but I don't know about the book. I haven't read it. I only watched a movie. And it was VERY BAD.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones

Oh dear.STORYI haven't read the books (didn't know they existed, lolz). But -still- I could tell by the way this movie makes frog leaps through the storyline and skims over certain things that somewhere, sometime this was supposed to follow a better storyline with more detail. But yeah, cram a book into 2 hours of movie and you re bound to mess it up. Honestly, the story is uninspired, clichéd and so full of plot holes it couldn't hold a drop of water to save its life and it's all a bit of a gobbled mess. I have never seen so many unfinished story lines and random stuff happening without a proper follow-up. stuff happens and... it isn't explained why. characters suddenly appear and disappear without as much as a hint where they came from or went to. time and time again... where were the scriptwriters? out having a snack?CHARACTERSCardboard cutouts.

Twilight's retarded kindergarten wrestle match can learn quite a lot from these sequences.SETTINGIf you are willing to accept that Hogwarts has been rented out to Evil Slayers, it always rains when something sad / dramatic happens (which is hard to tell at times due to the acting, but I digress) and werewolves live in a motorcycle gang garage, the settings are quite good. the whole movie has a nice, dark fantasy vibe hanging over it. with emphasis on dark. sometimes it was bloody impossible to see what the hell was going on. too... damn... dark. Directors, here's a hint: if you want to make a scary atmosphere, make sure the audience can see wtf is going on, at least. it was like Alien vs Predator Requim all over again.VERDICTHarry Potter-ish setting complete with magic combined with Twilight-like sappy teenage frolicking at the weirdest possible times in a fantasy universe. almost no humour, no proper acting, some proper incest, gay-out-of-a-box which makes no sense at all and comes out of nowhere and so many plot holes it boggles the mind and scenes so dark it was like staring up an elephant's arse. good points... ehr. no. let me call them 'redeeming factors' were the mood, the fight scenes and... ehr. the Honda CB4 at the end. (at least I think it was a CB4. couldn't tell CUZ IT WAS TOO FREAKIN DARK!(just kidding, it was during daytime, ask the vampire kid who somehow can walk around during the day without problems nor explanation)TL: DRToo much like twilight. Too much like Harry Potter. too little action, too uninspired and extremely sloppy made.5/10If you like Twilight (god help you) you'll like this probably. If you hate Twilight (god help you) you probably won't like this. This movie is Underworld gone gay (literally) and added some teen sappyness instead of heads getting sliced off. And let's be honest, we watch these movies for the slicing of(f) heads. Not to see teens wrestling with their hormones. we have a movie series for that already.

Not by the universe of demon-hunters but how it translated into a movie-verse. Let's start by the actors.Jace character seems to vary from broody to broodier to broodiest. And this is it. I grant the reader that my age group does not fit the demographics of this movie but to my knowledge a successful movie caters for all ranges of audience. Maybe the actor is worthier than my assessment; if so, the directing of actors must be ranged as poor.Clary the supposed heroin is a limpet. Ha, ha! Daughter of a war hero, she quickly falls into the cliché of the damsel-in-distress. Causing loads of mischief by her misbegotten decisions, lack of thereof and silences when she should speak.The adults have full gaping holes in their own story lines. Aidan Turner who has played Mitchell the vampire in Being Human UK must have wept compared to Peter Jackson: chuck me a bone, any bone but give me something to chew on as a character...Between the first gay love story and a curious love triangle : quite risqué would you say but since R.Wagner: Sigmund and Sieglinde, a few things are not taboo if they are well written and the secret is in well-written we are risqué stories which fall flat because unbelievable from the start.Good actors given monochromatic characters can give the best they can, the story is still pitiful and what a tragic waste it is since clearly this is a wonderful story with demons and angels and we do not know why there was once a day an angel who took pity on Earth...All in all, the author who invented this story deserved better.

The beginning was rather interesting, it made want to watch it, but nearing the end it got bad... It was somewhat predictable, at some points clichéd. I mean the plot wasn't bad, but it was made to look stupid and at times i wasn't following what was happening. There were some major plot holes and a lot of unnecessary parts. If you want to just watch something cool, i would recommend seeing it, but if you want to watch a good movie, this isn't it.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
142,marina0481,A great movie just not so stick-to-the-book scenario,8,6 June 2014,"This is the first review I 've ever written on a film. I watched the movie and dare say that the actor chosen to play Jace is PERFECT. ABSOLUTELY PERFECT. Fell in love with him as Jace even from the trailer. I also like Carly although I would have liked her better if she was a little more red- haired (but that's OK).I also thought Magnus Bane was adorable and I ve been loving Jonathan Rhys Meyers for years since ""The Tudors"" so I found him great as Valentine! (even though Valentine is supposed to be blonde) . Isabel in my opinion was cast wrong. Now for the plot.... I would have liked it much better if they sticked to the book some more. They have changed far too many things. The movie is a great movie it's just not exactly what the book was about. I would find it great if the next movie's scenario was closer to the book's story. I truly believe that for those who haven't read the books they 'll find this movie pretty great!",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
143,mwp-036,Disappointing,3,10 January 2014,"The Mortal Instruments is a great book series about a seemingly ordinary girl named Clary who finds herself thrown into a world of demons and angels, warlocks and vampires. The movie, however, was a mockery. I honestly can't believe I made myself sit through the entire thing, but I'm the sort of person that once I start a movie I have to finish it, no matter how bad it gets. And this one is bad. Even if I hadn't read the books, the movie still would have been disappointing. Clary is portrayed as a weak helpless little girl who can't be left alone for five minutes without something terrible happening to her. There is no continuity to the plot, and very little explanation of the various supernatural things around her for those who have not read the books. Many important plot points were changed, all for the worse. Even the weapons used are drastically difference from the book. Alec is a tool, Jace is an emotionless robot, and Simon is much more good-looking than in the book, while Valentine looks like a hobo. The only thing similar between this movie and the books is the names of the characters. A large portion of the movie is so dark that you have to squint to even see a vague outline of what's going on, and the whole thing looks like someone's high school multimedia class project that would get a ""C"" grade. As a movie, I'd give this 4 stars, since it has decent special effects and the actress who plays Clary is beautiful. As a book adaptation, I'd give this 1 star, simply because I can't give it zero. Save yourself the wasted time of watching this. If you want to know the story, read the books, as they are much better.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
144,lauravankessel,Don't watch if you want to read the books!!,7,22 May 2014,"First of all, I wish someone told me this before I watched the movie; The books are really good and if you are even so much as contemplating reading them, READ THEM FIRST! The movie is, as usual, pretty different from the books. Which is fine! The movie is still very decent. Pretty good, even. It's just... It contains a huge spoiler that, in the books, is only hinted at in the second and not revealed 'till the third book. And I don't understand why, really. The movies would be better without the viewer knowing, in my opinion...But... whatever! Writers choice. Nothing to do.Pretty good, nevertheless! Enjoy!",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
145,anakaday,Imaginative,9,1 August 2014,"This movie had very good sets ideas and characters. Feature packed with many parts to it. A girl lives a normal life with her artist mother until she goes to a night club and sees a symbol on the sign that nobody else can read. When she enters the club she witnesses a killing. One of the killers looks back at her shocked that she can see him as nobody else can. She starts drawing symbols all over her room. Eventually he meets up with her and tells her she is not a mundane and he was killing a demon that possessed the party goer. Her mother disappears and she finds out from a witch she had a mental block put on her as a child by a warlock. She finds out she is shadowhunter (half angel). She sees another world behind the one we live in. She goes to an academy that holds the secrets of the shadowhunter world. They go to the warlock but her friend gets taken by a pack of vampires. There is a big fight. The story goes on with lots of twists and turns as the mystery unfolds. a cup, a witch, werewolves, father with bad intentions, love interest( better without this), unique powers, good special effects and so forth.The love theme didn't work and there were a few cheesy comments but overall it was unique.I can see the points that people don't like about it but it only took away a point.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones

To start off I'm going to say that yes I did watch this movie before I ever read any of the books, and I do know you are going to say that's a big no no because it changes your opinion of the books. But I don't see it like that at all, I first watched this movie with my best friends whilst having a sleepover at 12 in the morning. But I the whole time I was in suspense loving the acting wishing I could have been part of this amazing project, as soon as the movie ended i texted my parents asking for the books that I needed to read urgently it was a matter of life or death to me. As soon as I got all of the books for Christmas I managed to read all of The City Of Bones on Christmas Day, I just couldn't put the book down at all. As soon as I finished reading I thought I don't get why people said to me I shouldn't have watched the movie before I read the book. I loved both of them, too me the movie is AMAZING I think that thy have captured the characters the setting and the whole general vibe right.

He portrays him as this Rockstar thin gothic hero who moves so gracefully when he is walking or fighting to protect Clary. He is also stunningly attractive to match the beauty of Lily Collins. Perfect Casting!!Clary (Lily Collins) is a rare beauty - she and Jamie have been brought up in the entertainment world and they both delivered. Their onscreen chemistry was off the charts for me. There kissing scene was sooo passionate and real, possibly because they were dating during filming.If you are needing a couple of hours of escapism and hot romance this is a must.I think Jamie - if they ever did a movie on David Bowie - he would fit the bill perfectly,",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones

153,Scene13,The Franchise Twilight Should Have Been!!,7,30 August 2013,"I'll start by saying i have not read the books.I'm not going to say I was dragged to this film kicking and screaming but it wouldn't have been my choice. My partner had been reading the books and she wanted to see the movie. So I apprehensively sat through trailers terrified of the boredom of a twilight-style love triangle masquerading in an Urban Fantasy setting. I felt a shiver as I imagined a protagonist trying to decide whether she loved ""Male Teen 1"" because his hair was so long or whether it's the ice cold touch of ""male teen 2"" that was what love she required?Guess what? My eyes didn't bleed! I didn't rip out my hair, but... my mind was blown! The mortal instruments: City of Bones was a fast paced, exciting slightly predictable and totally action backed movie. The Mortal Instruments is the franchise that Twilight should have been! In fact I enjoyed it more than my partner did... (4) Likes and (4)Dislikes discussed belowLikes(1) Acting and Character: I think the performances of Lily Collins as Clary, James Campbell Bower as jace and most importantly Robert Sheehan as Simon were all really good. Sheehan really showed a different side to his talents which I had only previously seen in Misfits (TV SERIES) I will be watching him in the future. I was impressed overall by the acting. I also felt that on the most part the characters where believable thanks to both the acting and the scripting. I was impressed.(2) Main Story line: This was a strong storyline and a great idea. It was fast paced and exciting. I never felt lost or overwhelmed. I also never felt that the film was going over my head. Enough explanations were given for you to understand the film leaving some things for you to imagine. This pleased me as I did want to sit through a lecture on ancient runes and underworld creatures. It felt like a mix between Twilight and Harry Potter. With Clary being the Harry and Valentine being the Voldemort. Which to me is can only be taken as a complement.(3) Visual Effects: The CGI and visual effects in this film were fantastic and no corners were cut. Whether it was the (SPOILER) Human to Demon or Human to Werewolf transitions (SPOILER END) or the Runes, or even the sonic screwdrivers they looked cool, and realistic. (4) Scare Factor: This film has some scary looking Demons. They genuinely looked terrifying. In this film... They are hideous. Additionally, the Silent Brothers also looked pretty scary . I was not expecting these charters to look like this. The success of these characters ties in with my previous point in that the visual effects in this film were top quality. I loved it.Dislikes(1) Acting and Character: Although I felt the acting was good and the charters were believable, I do have a few exceptions. Due to the scene where Simon and Isabelle are looking at versions of demons and other Underworlders that have been to a taxidermist. I felt that Jemima West's (Isabelle) acting was poor. Isabelle was explaining that Jace's past had made him who he was and she lack any kind of emotion, she looked gormless. In terms of character I felt that Luke(Aiden Turner) was a let-down however I feel the fault lies with the scripting/plot line. I imagine he comes out more in the novel.(2) Secondary Storyline: The love triangle. It was so poorly done. It was weak. It was predictable. It was unnecessary.(SPOILER) I'm sorry but maybe it was because of the transition from novel to film that it was a little rushed but Jace seemed to be a bit weird, his jealousy seemed a little over the top considering how little he knew her and Simon just didn't need to be in love with her. why could he not be friends. The scene outside Clary's bedroom door seemed forced and false.(SPOILER END)(3) Boys and Girls can't be friends: As with the Hunger Games I find myself baffled by why the love triangle was necessary. Why can't Boys and Girls be friends. Why does our media insist on portraying this to our youths... because this will probably make it a reality.(SPOILER) Simons character would have been just as strong if he had been a devoted friend rather than, a loved up, only really your friend because it might get me close to your knickers, creepy, stalker. The story (so far anyway) would've been just as strong if Clary and Jace had a romance and Simon was a good friend.(SPOILER END)Although I must say the triangle in this film is fairly tame, it's not like Twilight or Hunger games where it goes on and on ..and on and on(4) Leather, Really?: Once again we see Badass Characters in Badass Leather.. really?? It's a bit cliché. Why couldn't the Shadowhunters wear tracksuits or camouflage.. or even regular clothing. Then again I suppose it's just following a tradition, you can't make a film associated with vampire/werewolves without leather, Blade and Underworld set the standard! Overall a good film. Shame about some of the niggling bits. I was glad that I was taken to see this. I thought it was great. If you're being taken to this by someone who has read the books I imagine you will like it more than them. Especially, if they struggle to let go of the book and run with the film. Overall though a movie adaption of a book should be able to stand on its own two feet and I felt this hit the ground running. Recommend To: Twilight lovers so they can see what Twilight should have been!. To anyone who likes Urban Fantasy. To fans of Hunger Games or Harry Potter.

154,blackwolf33914,Not bad but can't live up to the book,5,19 February 2014,"I read all the books before walking into the movie theater to view this, the books were loved deeply my me so when I saw the movie I might of been expecting too much. While it has incredible effects with skilled stunts, it has too much of a teenage quality about it. The novels may be placed in the teen section in bookstores but the majority of fans are actually adults, teens make up a small portion of the fan base. Watchable and entertaining, the beautiful qualities that make up the Mortal Instruments books is missing. Many fans had a bitch fit when seeing the cast, I had no problem with Jamie Campbell Power, he placed Jace quite well. Same attitude as the character had even if he wasn't exactly what fans pictured. Well acted but still missing something; like I said maybe I was expecting too much. They also left out parts that were important to me, Jace's kidnapping and Simon being turned into a rat were left out; two of my favorite parts of the book. Hopefully the can improve in the City of Ashes, but that might be harder since that book was considered the least favorite among fans.

160,triskelsey,A Movie Different From the Book But Just as Good,8,23 August 2013,"I saw the Mortal Instruments: City of Bones today. Now, I really didn't go into it expecting it to be anything other than good and boy was it good I did. The movie definitely follows the book in basic outline, but it changes a lot of events and although it most movies that is frustrating, with this one it works perfectly. It makes things more clear for those who haven't read the books and it makes it a bit more believable and not so drastic.The acting was superb from everyone. Lily Collins and Jamie Campbell Bower are the perfect Jace and Clary while Jonathan Rhys Meyers is startling handsome and frightening. I wish we could have seen more of Alec but like in the books, he takes a back seat. Isabelle (Jemima West) and Simon (Robert Sheehan) were bad ass in the best possible way and Lena Headey's one scene of epic prowess has me longing for more.The movie was action packed and kept me on the edge the entire time, blending the 300 page book perfectly. Creepy, suspenseful, funny and romantic all in one great package. It had so many lines from the book and lines that should have been and I found myself laughing out loud at the witty comments.I highly recommend you go see this movie, whether you have read the books or not. It is one of the best films of this year and in my opinion, seriously up there with the Hunger Games in the best Young Adult movie.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
161,cherrylollification,"Worse than the book, and that is saying something...",4,11 October 2013,"When I first saw the trailer, I was so excited! I actually read City of Bones mostly because I needed a filler. Unfortunately, the first book was an absolute wreck with an interesting premise. I liked the idea of Jace and Clary and the shadowhunters, but my god, Cassandra Clare is a terrible writer. I was sad a first, but still very excited for the movie. I assumed they would change the static dialogue, the cringe-worthy situations, and the unnecessary events which took place in the book. Unfortunately for me the script was even worse than Clare's writing and the end result was an embarrassing train wreck.The script was the cause of incredibly awkward dialogues and lacked depth on any level! There was neither character nor plot development, and it really hurt the acting. It's very easy to see that this is Postigo's first screenplay. I was wrong when I said I did not think anything could be worse than Clare's writing. I'm still sitting here in shock after watching it. Just take the scene from the middle of the movie, right after Jace and Clary had their moment in the garden, when Jace AND Simon get mad because Simon's in Clary's room while Clary is kissing Jace. There's some screaming between the three characters, but the scene is only about 1 minute long, and the viewer is supposed to follow three people's emotional turmoil; the fact Jace doesn't open up often, Clary's new love, and Simone being in the friendzone etc. But the conversation was so static and rushed, that none of this actually showed on screen. Yes, it is written this way in the novel, but just because it is badly written once does not mean it has to be badly written twice! These were the types of things which I obviously thought the movie would improve upon. There are more moments like this, where the conversations are awkward and/or static, and nothing really comes of it. Like when Clary brings up the fact that Alec is in love with Jace. It's just there because it's in the book, but it serves no purpose. It is as badly done in the movie as it is in the book.Another major problem was the fact that the plot was rushed. I feel very sorry for the viewers who had not read the book, because as I was watching I had to refer to it to understand what was going on. For example, the viewer did not get to fully understand Hodge's situation in the end, where he had actually been imprisoned for following Valentine, and the emotions which should have been there. The rushed plot also contributed to the problems with the conversations lacking depth. Also, instead of cutting some of the more uninteresting parts of the book, each scene was cut down. For example, the whole vampire nest scene was extremely useless. Sure, you meet the werewolves for the first time, but they could have been nicely introduced in some other scene. If they had cut scenes like that, the important scenes would have been longer and could thus have been more developed and explored the characters and the plot. But the biggest plot flaw, and probably the worst part of the movie and the book, was the incest. However this is not Postigo's fault, since it is part of the book's plot. The way the incest was handled in the book was the reason why I did not continue reading the series. The fact that Clare continued to write about Clary and Jace continuing being in love, while still believing they were siblings was just too weird. Since I assumed Clare was not quite as twisted as to write about incest in a teenage book, I googled the fate of Clare and Jace. My suspicion was correct, but that does not make it right to write about two ""siblings"" who are fighting their love for each other. What the movie did correct was to show when the lie was fabricated. It made the situation better, instead of continuing the lie for a few book, and allowing the readers to think it is incest. But I still have a problem with the way Jace and Clary acted once they find out. It is, without a doubt, the most cringe-worthy moment of the whole movie. Because they don't stay away from each other, or become disgusted with each other; they continue with their relationship. Sure, without kissing, but they are still in love and Jace says that ""he needs her"" and that she's an angel. It is so incredibly disturbing, and a major plot flaw and it just irks me every time!See, the acting could have been better, but I am not blaming it on the actors. I am blaming the script and the director, because most of them are decent actors in other movies. For example, Jamie Campbell Bower in Camelot is great! And I also really like the other actors, like Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Robert Sheehan (him in Misfits is just hilarious), and Jared Harris etc. They have all done some really good stuff in the past, but they had to work with what they got, so the result wasn't great. I feel really bad for them, having to be associated with The Mortal Instruments in the future. This is the type of movie, which the actors will be embarrassed of having done, sort of like Clooney's Batman and Robin.Basically, the movie was worse than the book, and in all honesty that says a lot about movie. It's got plot issues, a lack of character development, and it is just downright terrible. My problem is just that both the movie and the book could have been so great! Had the writing/script just been up to par, and you minus the incest part, it would have been very enjoyable. Unfortunately, as it is now, it's absolutely horrific.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
162,PrincessTarah,This should have been so much better,4,22 August 2013,"The first half of the movie could have been really good. They had everything from the beginning of the book in there, but it was all out of order. This, combined with the fact that they didn't explain anything (Downworlders, Accords, Valentine, the Circle, etc.), made the movie confusing, especially for those who have not read the books. It also jumbled up the development of Jace and Clary's relationship, to the point where it didn't even really develop, it just kind of happened. I feel as though they had a basic understanding of the end of the book, so they discarded it for the latter half of the movie and just did their own thing. My biggest problem is that Jocelyn being hidden inside the institute the whole time is just way too far-fetched.Many important elements of the book were either a) left out completely, or b) needlessly replaced with something stupid. They put things in the movie that weren't supposed to come to light until City of Ashes, which I could have forgiven if they would have put everything from City of Bones in the CITY OF BONES MOVIE. They had a demon walk outside in the middle of the day, when in the books demons are killed by sunlight. That right there was just plain negligence. Speaking of negligence, I would like to know why the vampires wanted the mortal cup. Don't they know Valentine wants to use it to wipe out downworlders? Oh, wait....they apparently don't know that, because the movie didn't say anything about it. Finally, the thing I was most displeased with was that they revealed one of the biggest, if not the biggest, twists of the series, which was not supposed to be revealed until City of Glass (The Mortal Instruments #3): the fact that Jace and Clary are not actually related. Apparently, we're putting the spoilers in the movies themselves now. However, they did do some things right with this movie. First and foremost, the casting. It was perfect, except they really should have dyed Valentine's hair blonde, like it is in the books. But I can let that go, because Myers did such an amazing job portraying him. Also, the score was wonderful. And, I must admit, the shadowhunter-vampire fight scene was very cool. Lastly, I did like the Midnight Flower scene. It was my favorite chapter of the book and it was great to see they got it right. All in all, this movie is not a good representation of the book. While some shortenings and tweakings are necessary for all book-to-movie adaptations, they can still be portrayed well, and this film was not. If you saw the movie, whether you liked it or no, please please please READ THE BOOKS. They are amazing. Cassandra Clare created an awesome world, and everyone should see it the way it was meant to be.~A Shadowhunter & Book-lover",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
163,erikamikacic,A disappointing film adaption of Cassandra Clare's amazing series and a disgrace to her well thought out characters,1,28 August 2013,"No words could explain how BAD this movie is. The title gets as close to a summary as it can. It's such a pity that Cassandra Clare sold the movie rights to Warner Bros. After watching that sad thing of a movie I wish that there never was one at all if it had to be like that. Now the best I can hope for is that the movie does shitty in the box office so the sequel gets canceled. This movie had the potential to be the next Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings, based on the quality of the books. I don't know what was worse: gaping at the screen in shock and disgust because the cast couldn't get one single thing right, or not understanding what the hell is going on because some of the key things from the book are left out in the movie. At times, some random info just pops up as if everyone who's watching the movie has read the book. For crying out loud, even Jamie Campbell Bower hasn't read the book. Too bad, because if he had, he might have realized what a disgrace he is to Cassandra Clare through that gel-coated head of his. OK, I think I've thrown enough insults to the cast so I'll get to the point of why I've said what I've said. The worst thing about the movie was definitely the shitty cast. The acting was just plain awful. It might've helped if the guy playing Jace didn't look like a 14 year old lesbian (I guess I'm not done throwing insults around yet). Also, Clary is supposed to have orange hair. It's one thing not looking like I imagined them while reading the books, but not looking like your character was described? Ugh. if you grabbed a random woman off the street she'd resemble Clary more than Lily Collins does. During the whole movie she looks so confused - slightly parted lips and creased eyebrows. It comes off as fake and you can't relate to it.There were too many characters to introduce in too little running time. And even with all the cut-backs, the movie couldn't manage to stay on topic since they were too busy adding their corny jokes to it. When Clary and Jace found out they were ""brother and sister"" it was so stupid. Especially because they didn't include that Valentine was the one who brought Jace up until age ten. And it's so confusing why they included a whole part where Jace talks about his father breaking the neck of his pet bird. I mean, who the hell brought you up if it wasn't Valentine? How is Maryse going to accuse Jace of being valentine's spy? Will he even be a Herondale? And then poor Hodge who hated harming Jace suggests to Valentine that he tells them they're brother and sister. I think that was probably my breaking point. Nobody was supposed to know that they weren't brother and sister until book 4! i think that they were on the brink of suicide in the books because the 'fact' that they were brother and sister tore at their soul, but in the movie it seemed like a stupid fling.When they found out they were siblings, it seemed so casual. Movies like this are mostly the ones that focus on other elements like soundtrack, score and special effects since they have crap actors.But nope, this one is just all-round bad. From acting to special effects to hairstyles.Don't get me wrong, all that technology and effort is great and all if you're trying to create some kind of Disney fairyland like Peter Pan or Snow White. But these are shadowhunters we're talking about. And shadowhunters don't have magical gardens or portals with 'jello' in them. I'm not trying to abide by stereotypes, but if you already can't get the acting right, at least try to create the world of Shadowhunters as Cassandra Clare described it. As far as I know, that place isn't Neverland, but a place just like ours except with Shadowhunters, Demons and Downworlders. That's what makes it interesting and that's the only thing that makes it different from everyday life.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones

So when I went to watch the movie in theatres I was honestly very happy with the results.Obviously not everything was perfect like the book, but the story held together and it was entertaining. What's great is it has a kind of Harry Potter feel to it instead of the dreadful Twillight mood. IMDb just happens to be featuring a clip with the worst acting moment in the movie with the corniest joke.Overall, entertaining with some good laughs too! I recommend to at least see it once on DVD.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
165,happycalamity,If you want a good laugh at an awkward story and dialog this is for you,2,5 December 2013,"The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones is Hollywood's most recent attempt at another twilight style movie. Mortal Instruments is a series of books released in the late 2000's. I have to say right off the bat I really didn't like this movie it had awful dialog akin to what you might expect from a cheap Sci-Fi original. The beginning of the movie was super rushed putting the viewer in the thick of it before they really knew what was going on. Early on in the movie, and I am talking like 15 minutes in clary the main characters mother is kidnapped. When clary gets back to the apartment she has to run from a Rottweiler that transforms into what I can only describe as a demon octopus with a Rottweiler head. Clary then proceeds to blow up her kitchen to kill the demon octopus only to have it put itself back together where upon Jace arrives and kills the beast. Clary exclaims, ""What was that?"" Jace says, ""You wouldn't believe mean if I told you"" Clary replies, ""try me,"" Jace then says, ""It was a demon!"" Clary says, ""No I can't believe that."" My problem with that scene and dialog is that you just got chased by a Rottweiler that transformed before your eyes into a demon octopus then get blown up and put its self back together. If that's not a demon what the hell is? As the story progresses you feel even less of a connection to the characters and the movie has several attempted twist moments all of which the view sees coming a mile away. Any way on to the Action, Acting, Story, and Visuals starting with action; I suppose you could say that this movie has good action but stupidity ruins it. Example one the group is getting chased by demons clary magically freezes them in air then the characters try to sneak by them before turning around and waiting for them to get unfrozen so they can fight them. Dafuq? That doesn't make any sense and then it makes character deaths completely useless because the viewer is like who even was that that just died. Acting was really bad but that could have been because the dialog was so bad it was impossible to act well. Story I am not sure if the books are good but the overall story I gathered from the movie was really poor and a little creepy incest wise. Visuals, there was nothing new here standard CGI demons that didn't look very realistic. Overall Action 3 out of 5 Stars Acting 2 out of 5 Stars I blame this on the dialog the movie actually had a few solid actors in it. Here's to you Jared Harris and Lena Headey. Story 2 out of 5 Stars poor explanations and I really didn't care about any of the characters. Visuals 2 out of 5 Stars standard lack luster CGI effects. Final Judgment 9 out of 25 Stars wow you were worse than Spike Lee's Oldboy that's saying something.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
166,rach_luvs_svs07,Depends on how you position yourself against the book.,8,17 May 2014,"I've been following this film since day 1, having been a huge fan of the book series it's adapted from. I knew before it's release that it would be a huge flop because 1. The marketing scheme was one of the worst I have ever witnessed and 2. The recent dip in YA cinema attendance set it up for failure. This film had great potential to become something extraordinary but it was poorly executed and I have no doubt that there won't be a follow up film. The dialogue was terrible, the acting very poor and the story was rushed, it had no depth whatsoever considering the detail of the books; the only thing worthwhile was the innovative cinematography that looks, for lack of a better word, awesome! I gave it an 8, purely because of my love for the book and therefore I have a soft spot for the film, but anyone who hasn't read it will no doubt loath it.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones

I loved it!,8,12 September 2013,"I've read many books and seen many transition from the page to the screen, and all in all this movie was actually pretty good. At first I saw all of the negative reviews and was hesitant to see it but boy am I glad I did. The story is a little cramped yes but the screenwriter did a good job at cramming it in, those of us who have read the original novel know that there is a lot of lore and story within the book and to fit it into a movie along with good character casting and music had to of been a tough job. All in all it follows the books as much as it can without stomping on the series. It's not that bad of a movie...I mean I was more upset with some of the changes that they made in The Hunger Games than in this film, but that's beside the point. WORTH A WATCH! IGNORE THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS...THEY'RE ALL LIES. NOT THE BEST BOOK TO FILM MOVIE BUT STILL A GOOD MOVIE.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
170,forgotmypassword2009,I loved it!,10,29 August 2013,"Derived from teenage fiction, this film does more than prove itself, as do the actors that play the characters. I have now seen this film twice, and have not found myself bored by it at any point. Personally, I love the character of Simon, played by Irish Robert Sheehan. Perhaps I liked this character so much because it was played by him, but that's the whole point anyway, isn't it? His geeky charm is definitely one of the strongest personalities in the film, as well as his undying love for Clary, putting him in favour for some sympathy when he screams, ' I'm the one that's always been there for you, not him. I love you!' This was by far my favourite part of the film, being a sucker for love triangles I did like it when it reached this boiling point. But it never goes too far into the triangle as so many other films do, and you can foresee a relationship between Simon and Isobel from the start.Whilst I have not read the books yet (I will as soon as possible) my friend whom I watched it with the second time, objected to how different it was. Understandably, when a film adaptation is so different from the original paperback version it can be hard to love the film because of it. However, if you have read the book, you simply need to go into the cinema with an open mind, and think of the book and the film as different things. The other main characters were portrayed brilliantly by the actors, and there was not one actor or actress that I disliked or thought was just awful. The music is one thing that people seem to dislike, but I quite enjoyed the Demi Lovato ""Heart by Heart"" in the garden scene with Jace and Clary. Although the song is quite hard to listen to outside of the film (in my personal opinion it is far too pop-romantic) it fits accordingly with the scene it is played, and I actually enjoyed it, as I did with the ""TV Spot: Love"" that can be found on youtube as promotional for the film. Go and watch the film because it's amazing; just go with an open mind, and with your imagination as ready as ever, because many of the concepts require an ability to think outside of ""normality"". That it one word I would not use to describe the tone of the film.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones

I went to see it with the idea that I will see a movie with a beautiful story line and all such a movie needs to have....kinda Twilight...well...I came out with tears in my eyes....not from the storyline but from the intense laughing I have had the pleasure to encounter. After the first 20 minutes where the story was perfect and it really turned to be a very good start of a movie it all turned into a futuristic comedy where all the characters , faces, scenes, lines, replicas, were meant to make you laugh. So thanks to the producer for this beautiful comedy....someone should add the comedy tag to it. The never ending Gold Cup rush with the funny vampire, werewolf, shadow hunter combination...where in the end no one has any idea why all this guys needed so bad the Golden Cup .... the simplicity of the scenes and not at least the dress up's for some characters...turned a nice story into a comedy....the last scenes when all the ""monsters"" are invading the holy ground...""priceless""....Thank you",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
172,pioneerkaren-677-931756,Disappointing,5,11 December 2013,"I so looked forward to this movie and desperately wanted to like it. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. Despite a solid performance by Jamie Campbell Bower as Jace Wayland and an okay performance by Lily Collins, the other casting choices were uninspired. The decision to include plot devises from the second book used up screen time that could have been used to strengthen the plot devises from the actual City of Bones book. My biggest problem with the movie however is that the second half of the movie goes completely off script in every way.Casting Johnathan Rhys Meyers could have worked if his character had been written closer to his disposition in his new Dracula series rather than the Joker from Batman. The Valentine of this book series holds himself in a classy way and is very businesslike. This is what makes his menace all the more hair-raising. His henchmen Panghorn and Blackwell should follow the novel as more refined...not dumb, loud muscle.I question other casting choices because they felt all wrong to someone who is such a fan of the series... even to the casting for Clary and Jocelyn. There is so much focus in the book about the red hair that they share, as well as Clary's curls, it is hard to suspend the preconceived visualizations I have for them. A good dye job and a perm could have definitely helped. Finally, I have a real problem with the whole spear pentagram/ demon summoning inside the Institute, a plot line that is nowhere found in the book. What is that all about? I would have found the battle described at the end of the actual book far more exciting. Also, without the abandoned police station as the home of the wolves and Renwicks hospital as Valentine's ""secret lair"" we are missing two important locations, one of which is important in the whole series.I am disappointed and wish they would just remake this first movie to fix all of the problems before they start making more.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
173,laestrada-1,Horrible adaptation of the book,1,28 August 2013,"Having read and loved all the books I can honestly say that this was as poor of an adaptation as I have ever seen. I realize no movie can ever compare to a book however others have managed to stay true to the story at least the main plot lines, characters and ideas. This was such a watered down version of the story that I barely recognized it. Everything from the miscasting of the main characters to their poor performances this movie is a horrible bust. It is a shame the series is fantastic and I was very excited to see it come to life. I really can't see how they can bring the rest of the books to life when the first one is so poor.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones

And I will say that this movie definitely did not live up to the book...but honestly, not many of them do. The acting was definitely sub-par and some of the writing was corny, but its not HORRENDOUS. I enjoyed the movie, I thought it was dark and fun. No, its not a million dollar blockbuster, Oscar winning movie. No, it does not make my top ten list. But I enjoyed watching it.

176,Mihaela123,Could've been better,6,24 August 2019,"This felt like a tried and true formula of almost every YA fantasy: main character living in the normal world and his/her initiation into the ""actual"" world, messed up love triangle (not to mention the ever so disappointing incest), the bad guys chasing the good guys to retrieve a powerful item etc.
I must admit even though I have seen this type of movie over and over, they actually got me in the first half. It's a cliche but a good one if you do it right.
The second half got me very very disappointed because it was just mindless action almost to the finish.
And I feel like I should address the ""what could've been a cute YA romance turned awkward incest"" situation. I was just disappointed with it because of the obvious reasons. Incest only works in game of thrones and this just felt awkward.
It's like the writers were trying to have a different take at a forbidden romance and just squeezed the incest. Spoiler alert: they just made it disgusting.
Aside from the above mentioned issues, this could've been a good fantasy movie.
Emphasis on the ""could have"" part.
It had good visuals and half of the story was good. So, I'm giving this a 6.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones

Take this one for example: It's an amalgam of scenes from other movies, just thrown together. Some scenes just don't make sense. It's extremely predictable and quite annoying to be honest. It's the kind of movie that goes in the background on some TV station while you're getting dressed. For me it was a huge disappointment, but hey... I liked Gravity, some people hated it. So to summarize: it's just not for me. But I would like to ask just one question, from one of the many scenes that annoyed me: The one with the werewolves. After they save everybody from the vampires, the main character has a moment, just after her life was saved by a werewolf, where she asks for a knife and throws it at him. WHY?! Honestly, why?! Danger was over, the girl takes her time and just does this stupid thing. What was the purpose to this? And furthermore, how can a stupid scene like that not get cut???

179,lsorbd,Flawed start for a hopeful franchise,7,21 August 2013,"I almost always agree with the critics, but this time. Yes, it has a lot of plot holes. And, yes, its climax isn't that worthy of applause. But this might be the first time you had so much fun with a newcomer since The Philosopher's Stone. And, curiously, it has almost the exact same flaws of the first HP movie: it doesn't know where it will lead, it has the pressure of being exactly like the book and kinda needs the support roles to make the movie a solid picture. A lot of flaws that don't take off the shine of this movie: it's one of those times you watch a flawed start that could turn into a big franchise. Visuals are mostly breathtaking, CGI almost always in its best and a solid screenplay. Main roles are fittable, if not the best representation of its book counterparts, and Lena Headey and Robert Sheehan steal the picture in almost every minute of their presence. Villains are a little messy - but don't you say Quirrell was a decent one. Jokes - even sexual ones - have a nice place. But, most of the times, you can say you're watching a good movie by its direction: Harald Zwart abuses from different camera angles, making you follow the action and even get dizzy with its high vistas - something really nice for IMAX exhibitions, even if it's DMR-processed. Soundtrack is also a charm: Zedd's ''Into The Lair'' could have sounded cheap, but the scene it plays is directed so well, it seems perfect. Demi Lovato's can be judged as a audience-grabber, but it echoes during the movie as the love theme Lana Del Rey's ''Young and Beautiful'' came up to be in 2013's The Great Gatsby. Colbie Caillat's ''When The Darkness Comes'' is, though, the OST's least song, but it feels greater in the movie. Gags rule the second act of the movie, but in such a dumb-laughing way, you feel they don't make the movie bad - or stupid - at all. No Lightning-Thief-messing-up. Disconsidering the book (and all of the discussions about Jace not being British), you can say it's a movie on its own: you ain't missing plots without reading the book and, if you feel there are lots of holes, they must be somewhat in the book too. It's the summer (possibly) blockbuster you didn't know you were eagering for.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones

181,tamtoma,yea just flush those books down the toilet and write another story,1,4 February 2014,"Terrible terrible movie! i was looking forward to watching the movie before I read the books. I'm pretty sure I would have hated it even if I hadn't read the books. first the soundtrack was awful and made no sense. It only added cheesiness to the movie. the acting was terrible in most cases. the effects were kinda stupid and exaggerated SPOILERS now for the plot and characters. from the minute the movie started, the plot started changing but hey small differences are alright. but things got way out of hand, I don't understand how they'll make the second, third etc movies after they've changed the plot so much. they also missed a lot of things that are key to the rest of the story. when Clary's mom is kidnapped, we see her drinking the thing and fainting, which is something we should figure out in the third book. also, nothing happened in the institute. the portal does NOT look like that, and if you go into it untrained you'll just end up somewhere you've been thinking of lately, you don't get lost in limbo!!!Simon is turned into a rat, NOT kidnapped by vampires for no apparent reason. and BTW vampires have nothing to do with the cup! Clary notices the bite marks on Simon's body... no she doesn'tLuke is not held captive and tortured by the two guys that follow valentine, it's a normal conversation. BTW the movie did not highlight the very awkward relationship between valentine and Luke. Luke used to be a shadow-hunter, where did that go ?? Hodge turn good again at the end? since when? and there was no spell it was all in his head... really?? and he does not give the idea of telling them they're brother and sister. Jace sees valentine and recognize him as the father he knew, the father he saw murdered. they did not tell us anything about the circle and the uprising, and they made Clary's mother look like a housewife who just ran away. she planned an uprising she is no ordinary women. and BTW, no one know of valentine's experiments and he didn't give his blood to Clary and Jace, he gave them something else. and he does not know that Clary has special powers by then, and neither do we for that matter. as for the character, they were all wrong!!!!! good guys first: Clary is way over dramatic, she's supposed to be strong and reckless not a whiny teenager. I like lily Collins but I think this movie might have ruined her career. Her and her mom's hair color is wrong, it should be the shade of red you see a mile away, not dark barely noticeable red.Izzy is fierce and astonishing. there is nothing special about the character in the film. note: she's supposed to be very tall.in general, Izzy and Alec's character aren't as strong as they should be Luke: we are supposed to hate him until we find out he was faking not caring, but no we figure that out the first five minutes and the element of surprise is gone. Magnus: he has cat eyes, where did they go? that is the most unique thing about him, instead he just has light eyes Jace: he is supposed to be super cocky and he always has something sarcastic to say. in the movie he is quite mostly. he is not head over heels the minute he sees Clary, not at all. I'm not sure what else to say, but the character was all wrong. hodge: I was expecting and Einstein look not sure why. he wasn't so bad, but of course the whole betrayal thing is much a bigger issue than they show it in the movie. Lastly there is Valentine. They ruined his character completely. talk about bad casting I mean seriously?? first of all, where did the white hair go?? he has silvery hair and pitch black eyes... he is elegant in general. he is a big man, broad shoulders "" this was mentioned a lot in the book"" he is very very smart and charming. he is a villain who believes in what he is doing not a crazy guy who just wants to kill ugh and raise demons.

I wonder if any of the people involved in the script actually read the book(s).They did use some of the quotes from the book but they really just seemed to take some quotes from the book, make some scenes which vaguely resemble those in the book at times and throw the quotes in there. They left out many important parts of the book and sadly, the end of the book and movie are about as similar as black and white.I felt generous and gave a 2 due to my love of the books.To me, this destroyed the wonder of the books.

Also, Simon, the character, had may other things that happened to him in the book than in the movie. For example, the vampires turned him into a rat first before hauling him away to be Clary bait.Other than minor things, like these, it is a carbon copy of the original.

190,BluesMessiah87,"If you're only defense is..""yes it's like Twilight, but I actually LOVED Twilight""...",1,12 January 2014,"I watch (and enjoy) a lot of movies. I watch and enjoy a lot of movies that most others call bad. Honestly, I am embarrassed sometimes to admit that my standards are pretty low as to what a movie has to be in order for me to find it entertaining. And I like movies about angels- vampires-werewolves-demons-etc. I even had modest expectations for this movie, saying to myself ""yes, there will probably be a Twilight-esque feel to it, but it could be different enough to be entertaining."" I really WANTED it to be, based on the premise, but knowing it was based on a series aimed at teens, well, that's where the Twilight ties come in. And yes, I HATED the entire Twilight series. I did try to watch each movie, hoping that I could find a redeeming quality. But.never.did.The good about The Mortal Instruments - some of the visuals maybe. I didn't read the books, so maybe the source material was better. But it failed on so many points I don't know where to start. I've read other reviews that hit many of them on the head. One suggested that they really got away from the aspect of this series that separated it from the pack - the seraphin/angel/demon focus. I would agree. Yes, it's there and it's explained, but that's it. An angel, even half-angel, should be able to lay waste to Vamps and Werewolves, and to extent were in the movie. But it seems like the ""lower classes"" would have figured that out by now and ""known their place."" This didn't seem to happen at all.And then there's the whole incest thing. You can debate whether or not they ""knew"" Valentine was lying (which, I'm told, he wasn't), but it just didn't seem to really phase them too much. Clary's statement that she didn't really believe he was her father seems more like ""I don't want to believe it so I'm going to say I don't so that I can keep doing what I want to, even though there really wasn't a compelling reason why I have such immediate strong feelings for my supposed brother anyway."" Bottom line, at this point they both have to suspect that it could very well be true and they have absolutely nothing but their own desire to not believe it to disprove it. But don't care. And because they don't, the audience shouldn't either.And so many things wanted me to rewind the movie because I was sure I must have missed something. Apparently there's no reason to warn your best bud that he's been bitten by a vampire, or any of your new friends who, you know, actually know about this world and maybe knew a way to prevent him from turning into a vamp (although apparently, although she is told earlier ""all the stories you heard (about vampires, werewolves, etc.) are true (which would include every story about vampire bites ever),"" this was NOT true. Or maybe he did. Vamps seem to be especially weak in this, so maybe the only thing they have going for them is really bad immortality and really good eyesight. And every character is forgettable. Every one. 5 minutes after the movie ends you'll have a hard time remembering anyone in it or why they were there. At times I didn't even know where people, who seemed to be big players, came from. Again, I thought I had zoned out at times and completely missed a big point. Were a lot of the holes that others have complained about actually ""explained"" in the movie? Well, yes, if you consider 1 line giving you a very elementary ""this is what the cup does"" explanation sufficient. But so much of it feels so forced it's just hard to get drawn into any aspect.So far the only defense I've seen is from people objecting to the ""This is worse than Twilight"" comments, which usually involve co-defending the Twilight series. That should be evidence enough that this movie fails in so many ways. I still think that the basic premise of the series lends itself to something that could be done well and become something worthwhile, but if they make a sequel and don't fix the myriad of problems, a semi-original idea gets completely lost in what feels like an attempt to purposely make it unoriginal.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones

However, it's entertaining with several fun characters and an interesting storyline, with an amusing script. It's a shame sequels were not made. At least we have this film.No, I haven't read the books. I've taken a look at clips from the later tv series and it doesn't look as well-made and well-acted as this film.

I have read them many times. And this was an awful movie.First of all, both the casting and the acting were atrocious. Kevin Zegers, Jemima West and Jamie Campbell-Bower are simply too OLD for the parts they played. They did not look like 16 and 18-year-old teenagers. They're acting was horrible as well. Jace is supposed to be rude, cocky, outgoing , and sarcastic. Instead he was portrayed as soft-spoken and passive aggressive. Isabelle lacked her spunk as West's acting fell flat. Robert Sheehan's acting was poor as well. And Lily Collin's is simply not a strong enough actor to play Clary, who came off as a little weak. Magnus was lacking his characteristic sass, drama, and attitude that is so endearing.Next, the script: There was not nearly enough humor. Magnus was the most poorly written character, he was very different from his portrayal in the books.The majority of movie was rushed and lacked explanation, but the very long fight sequence at the end was exhausting, dull, and unnecessary. The movie felt unnecessarily long, yet lacked crucial information.Bottom line: Read the books, and skip the movie. SKIP THE MOVIE.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
193,bevanwalling,"A Hitler joke, really?",2,6 January 2016,"I already had low expectation from the reviews before I saw this movie, but though I'd give it a shot as I'm writing a YA novel. I understand the books may be different from the movie, but character development aside, this was a stupid movie. This movie tries to throw in some comedic elements yet does so with such bad timing. Even in the confrontation with the big bad guy, the main character drops a Hitler joke. Really? There were some pretty cringe worthy moments in general. Also throughout the movie the magic system is very much focused on killing daemons then right at the end for some reason she busts out some harry potter use magic to clean a wrecked house magic, what? how does this correlate to anything else I've seen in this whole movie?",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones

She is the author of the book that the film is based on therefore, watching the movie gave me all of the incredible books that she has wrote. It's not an Oscar-winning brilliant and clever film but it is a really good fantasy romance with beautiful, good actors.

195,roh_dude,Saints awry and demons fly.,5,6 September 2013,"Somewhere between horror and fantasy ""Mortal Instruments"" I did enjoy this movie. Sorry have not read the books. A certain slorphing nightmare was a gruesome vision that did indeed bring a wretched quake. In fact most of the demons bought a sense of repulsion that was quite unpleasant. The setting gloriously adorned with the gamut of creatures of the night angels,demons,undies wearing sorcerers,vampires and werewolves all seemed a bit haphazard but implies a very decadent world. The characters apparently of the appropriate ilk for said story of angels and demons matched to a coming of age sexual overtone was close to a horror story theme. This matched with the seeming awkwardness of the whole affair I guess screams teen angst. A fair background scenario and some good touches makes the melodramatic, horror/fantasy,twisting plot,coming of age,touching family drama with a message an OK time passer.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones

I think these quotes during and after the movie sum it all up (see below).1. -""Magnus is hot"" - ""Yes, but he can't act"" - ""Who cares, he's hot""2. ""Um, is it me or are there part of book 2 in this movie, or is it all just rearranged or moved around...I'm confused and I read the books.""3. ""The cast is great, but what happened to the script...where did all this crap dialogue come from and why are all the jokes so flat?""4.

197,grimesy_jnr,Huh?,2,1 September 2013,"The main reason i wanted to see this film was because one of my favourite artists: Seven Lions, had a song (strangers) featuring on the soundtrack. Then i looked up the soundtrack and 2 other artists i love had songs featuring too. I looked up the film on IMDb and 7/10 not bad, lets go see it. The film dumps you straight into the action within the first 10 mins and you have no idea what's going on. The main girl protagonist just accepts the fact there are monsters in the world and her mums a demon hunter so quickly. The acting is well over dramatic and completely unbelievable There's this weird love triangle that is a twilight clone (yet worse) Especially the scene with Jace on the piano Seven Lions' song didn't even play in the movie??? I gave this film a 2/10 instead of a zero for the following reasons: -The demon dog was pretty freaking badass -It featured a song by Zedd (even though it was so out of place and just felt dumped in, especially when it transitioned back to the original soundtrack)Thats all i have to say maybe i needed to have read the books but this is one to steer clear of.P.s did anybody else think Simon was going to turn into a angel? i felt let down haha",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
198,fox_rose,"Light-hearted fun, but predictable.",7,21 September 2013,"I went to go see this in the theater with my best friend last night. The screening was almost empty, aside from 3 other people, which always makes me happy and able to focus more on the film. I had tried to read the books, (and don't hate me) found them to be a bit overwritten & predictable, so I didn't have high hopes for the film itself. In some ways, it surprised me. It was a fun, enjoyable movie, with lots of sarcastic humor, and one surprising twist. Magnus Bane was a brilliant character, and Jamie Campbell Bower was as easy on the eye as his co-star, Lily Collins. The CGI was believable and there were moments of pure beauty in the cinematography.It's the kind of film you watch when its raining and you want something funny and light-hearted, that you don't have to pay too much attention to. Unfortunately for us, it was also incredibly predictable. Once you've seen a certain amount of this genre, it all becomes a bit boring, and no amount of eye candy or flashy CGI could change that.I will almost certainly see it again at some point, and its a good way of wasting a few hours, without breaking new ground for the genre.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones

This movie could have easily been The Seeker:Darkness is rising or I Am number 4(seeing as they chose to cast the exact same guy in the exact same role). Kevin Durand once again has a knife and a crew and is interrogating and hunting down a special child(screams original right). Nothing about this movie was entertaining or drew me in. It felt like watching a dark fight filled episode of The Secret Circle right down to finding out the main character's father was the bad guy (If a person didn't see that coming they probably would freak out if you ""stole"" their nose). To me the movie failed to express a point: find mom-don't get killed-find the cup-don't get killed-omg you're my dad he's my brother-don't get killed-protect the cup-finishing with i can clean up with my mind and now i'm a shadow hunter. I can see this movie franchise being shelved just as I am number 4 was.

200,sidrah64,Amazing But Book Was Still Better,10,22 August 2013,"My overall opinion on the movie is that it was amazing! The movie followed the books storyline very closely. There were parts that were cutout but obviously in a movie, they can't have the whole book, they need to take stuff out. There were obviously stuff that could have been better and stuff that was spot on perfect. Some stuff that didn't make the movie so great were:1. Godfrey Gao didn't play Magnus very well. His voice was monotone and he made no witty remarks. It didn't feel like Magnus at all. 2. It could have better if there'd been more witty remarks from Jace. There were a few but not as many as I would have liked. 3. Valentine could have been more calm and collected rather than all over the place. He played a good Valentine but the insane look in his eyes wasn't necessary. I liked Lily Collins as Clary cause she played her really well. Jamie was a pretty good Jace. Most of the characters matched the book very well. Some people have complained that Clary's hairs too dark or that the music choice was bad or the animation sucked. I feel there arguments are invalid. Obviously the directors couldn't have gotten the cast spot on and gotten every single little detail right but they got it close. The music choice matched the scene's very well, especially when Jace and Clary kiss. And the animations were quite realistic. Overall: Superb movie, one of my favorites and you should definitely read the books and watch the movie.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
201,psuresh99,My favorite movie so far!,10,31 August 2013,"This movie caught my attention only because of Lily Collins. But after going to the theater i noticed Jamie Campbell Bower is a great actor and portrayed Jace very well. There is a lot of comedy as well as suspense. Robert Sheehan who plays Simon adds to the comedic part of the movie. If you like suspenseful fantasy movies definitely see this! I already saw this 4 times and i cant stop. This is nothing like harry potter or twilight its a completely different story line. The books are amazing but this movie was almost exactly the first book was written. The actors are great in this movie and Jamie Campbell Bower has a mysterious look that completes Jace perfectly. He and Lily have great chemistry that complete the two characters. The critics are way to rough, my advice to you is to go out and see it!",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
202,WonWaiWai,Good acting and visual effects.,3,22 August 2013,"First off, I'll just say I like Lily Collins, Aidan Turner and Robert Sheehan as actors. Having said that, I think the all the actors did a good job (except for some of the line deliveries incl. from Ms Collins) for the most part of this movie. The visual effects are great too.However, in terms of character development, script, soundtrack, and sequence; I felt distracted/detached during the movie, disappointed after the movie ends, and found the whole movie hilarious/ridiculous on the way home. Some scenes felt too rushed while some felt like time- wasters/dragged (especially the last 30 or so minutes), some dialogue sounded like I'm watching a student film, some characters seemed like they shouldn't even be there, and most of the soundtrack makes me feel even more detached from/uncomfortable with the movie.In the end, I thought the movie had a really good potential (I've never read the book), but it'll need a better director/screen-writer for the sequel. Otherwise I don't see why people would return.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
203,heathypower,"The Movie doesn't compare to the book, but it was still Fantastic!",8,23 October 2013,"The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones is one of my favorite movies, that is if you don't compare it to the book. I only had a few problems with this movie: 1. Valentine should NOT have dreadlocks (I still love you Jonathan Rhys Meyers)He is a Shadowhunter, not a pirate 2. I wish that the fight with the abbadon had to be longer 3. Simon did not turn into a rat, what was the point of the drink then? Besides those things it was amazing! Kevin Zegers and Robert Sheehan did the best job at portraying their roles in my opinion. Even when Kevin wasn't talking, just by the looks that he gave, told me he was the perfect Alec. Even though I can't stop picturing him as Will Herondale from The Infernal Devices... Robbie showed Simon's emotion so well and he looked amazing while doing it so I applaud him, good job Robbie! The others, Jaime Campbell Bower, Lily Collins, Jemima West, Aidan Turner, etc. were great as well. I just wish Godfrey Gao, who played Magnus Bane, would have been a bit more exciting and unexpected as Magnus, but I must give him credit for only wearing his boxers in front of Harald Zwart. Two scenes where I found myself crying were when Simon confessed his love for Clary, and when Alec almost got killed by Abaddon. But my favorite scene, and I think the fellow book readers will agree, was the greenhouse scene with Clary and Jace! So, if this movie hadn't been based off of that book I think I would have given it 10 stars, but since it was, and it just barely missed the mark of my dream Cassandra Clare Shadowhunter world, it gets a 9.

204,RedBearAK,Hooo-rrible Awful Terrible,1,13 December 2013,"[ SPOILERS AHEAD ]This is one of those movies where the only thing you can say to yourself starting from about five minutes into it is: ""If these are the people protecting the world, we are DOOMED."" Filled with some of the most cliché, asinine, juvenile dialog and personalities I've seen in years. Makes Twilight look like a top-notch literary classic by comparison. Hard to believe, I know. Gives Eragon a run for its money in terms of facepalmy unwatchability. Let's examine some specific examples of the many ""how the hell is every character in this movie so STUPID"" moments. The protagonista's friend Simon is captured by vampires, taken back to their lair and trussed up in chains. They rescue him, nearly getting themselves killed in the process, only surviving because some werewolves conveniently show up and, also conveniently, it's almost dawn. No effort is apparently expended figuring out why he was captured by the vampires. Nobody among the team of teenagers -- whose sole purpose in life is supposedly to deal with demons, werewolves, vampires and other supernatural things -- finds it particularly odd that Simon no longer needs his thick nerd glasses afterward they rescue him. Seriously? Any six-year-old at this point in the movie should be able to correctly answer the question, ""Do you think Simon has been bitten by a vampire?""The protagonista's mother, apparently trying to protect her daughter, completely fails to give her any kind of information or training that might help her stay alive or get help in the event something nasty happens. Quite predictably, something nasty happens. The protagonista's new boyfriend spends five minutes of the movie telling her about how a certain set of piano notes written by Bach can reveal the presence of a demon possessing someone. He then plays the music on a piano while locked in an apartment with someone who we can already tell is acting a bit oddly, yet both he and the protagonista remain completely oblivious to the amazingly obvious negative reaction of the now clearly possessed individual to the music he's insisting on playing. We think he's insisting on playing this music because he already suspects the person may be possessed, but no, apparently he just feels like playing some music. Despite all the build-up, they are quite surprised when the demon finally reveals itself, grabs the magic cup, kicks everyone's ass and leaves. The audience clearly sees that the person is possessed even before the music starts. What exactly was the point having the guy play the music? So we could see just how stupidly oblivious the characters are? At the exact same time the other members of the team use some kind of demon-finding substance in the room DIRECTLY UPSTAIRS. They watch the substance slide around on the floor of the clearly empty upstairs apartment, clearly showing the presence of a demon IN THE ROOM BELOW. They are apparently too stupid to figure this out, and just stare at the substance dumb-founded as it moves back and forth on the upstairs apartment floor, until FINALLY they hear a scream from downstairs and figure out that they should go back downstairs and help out. Whereupon they are stymied by, get this, a standard household security chain on the downstairs apartment door. Aren't these guys supposed to be stronger than the mere mortals they are tasked with protecting? I could pick the whole movie apart like this. It's just unbelievable stupidity piled on top of unbelievable stupidity, with a topping of horribly clichéd dialog, predictability, overly dramatic music and overly long fight scenes. I've watched and enjoyed some pretty god-awful sci-fi and fantasy over the years simply because I love the genres so much, but so far I've only gotten two- thirds of the way through this and I've already had to pause it and go do something else a couple dozen times. Maybe if I watch the rest of it on mute...",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
205,7colorfulrainbows,"The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones: Will satisfy not only all fantasy lovers, but ""mundanes"" as well!",8,10 September 2013,"The Mortal Instruments series were first written in books by Cassendra Claire. I started reading from City of Ashes (because I didn't know the story was written in series), then read City of Bones, and then City of Glass. Unfortunately I almost forgot all of the storyline since I didn't read them in order, but when I heard the first film will be out, I was thrilled! Reason being is that I'm a fantasy lover who always chases after all films in the action/adventure/fantasy/drama genre. The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones was definitely one of them. I was quite satisfied with the cast of the film because I already know Lily Collins (Clary) as Snow White from Mirror Mirror and Jamie Campbell Bower (Jace) as Caius from the Twilight Saga. Both of them were really good actors. The co-stars (Simon, Alec, Isabelle, Magnus Bane, Jocelyn, Luke & Hodge) did great as well. What I love about this film is the special effects and the originality of the storyline that Cassendra Claire has created. In one scene, Jace had separated a piece of the blue Portal, placed it in midair next to Clary, then when he goes to put his hand into the Portal, it actually comes out right ""next"" to Clary from the bubble. That was an amazing idea! I also loved it when they gave the above camera view on the magic pentagram Valentine was trying to construct. Another scene I liked was when Jace tried to prove to Valentine that he is a Wayland by showing the ""W"" letter on his ring, and with Valentine responding by turning Jace's ring upside down so the ""W"" (Wayland) becomes an ""M,"" revealing to Jace who he truly is, that he is Valentine's son: Jonathan Morgenstern. The scene where Clary was able to reach into the card & retrieve the Mortal Cup was memorable as well. It's also amazing how Clary could see a 3D tea cup turn into 2D by examining it at a different angle! I absolutely love the actions the crew had put into the film. All the battle between shadow hunters and demons were very exciting & nerve- racking. The jump scares made the film all the better. Plus, the settings (e.g. the library, the City of Bones etc) in the film totally matches the story's events & looks stunningly brilliant. The Institute looked fantastic! I understand in order to make the whole thing from book to screen, the story won't be told in just one perspectives. So the constant shifting of perspectives the crew had created during the action scenes was also what made the film interesting. Such as when Jocelyn Fray was facing the demon attack in her home simultaneously as Clary was rushing home to find out what's happening. I knew that part was not in the book but I'm glad the crew included it here. Surely the audience must've laughed in at least some scenes when seeing this film, because the part where Jace was disarming & removing all of his shadow-hunting weapons the library was quite funny. In conclusion, the visual effects & the sound effects put together worked brilliantly and the Mortal Instruments: City of Bones was so far the best fantasy film I've ever seen. The audience will love the action, the romance, the struggle, the plotting! I scored it 8/10. Please praise for the Mortal Instruments series! I'm so looking forward to seeing its sequel film City of Ashes!!!",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
206,Mickeymauhead,Great movie,9,23 October 2013,"Since I know a lot of you haven't read the book, I'll base the review off the movie, not the books.The movie started out fast. Simon and Clary go to the poetry reading, then Club Pandemonium, then Clary's mother gets attacked. Good, but could have slowed it down a bit. Then of course, Clary sees Jace at Club Pandemonium and that's where it all starts, and everything slows down a bit and it gets Better and better.To sum it up, the pros and cons.Pros:+ Beautiful scenery+ Robert Sheehan was the perfect Simon.+ The action kept you at the edge of your seat.+ The music that plays during the fighting scene at club Pandemonium.+ The dialogue was EXACTLY the same as the book! (For the readers out there.)+ Jemima West's beautiful eyes. OK, maybe the last one was just me.Cons:+Jamie Campbell Bower looked scrawny, especially in the shirtless scene. + Added some scenes from the second and third book. (For the readers out there.)+ Jocelyn's duck lips.Well hopefully this helped for everybody debating whether or not to see this movie, and the readers too.

207,Yellolo,"Bad, really, really bad...so bad",2,14 September 2013,"Where do I start with this? Firstly I would like to talk about Jace. In the books I loved Jace. Jace was witty, funny and sarcastic, mysterious and had a tendency to bad moods. Yet the character in the movie is not Jace. I was one of the people who believed that Jamie Campbell Bower would be a good Jace but there was none of his usual dry humour (except once but JCB can't pull of the sarcasm so it ends up sounding like a serious statement), no mystery as he tells Clary EVERYTHING in basically like the first 15 minutes, there's none of that distance you feel and in the movie it's obvious to everyone that he likes her. -Lily Collins is just so annoying! -Alec and Isobel have about 20 lines between them throughout the entire movie. -They skip ahead to like the third book and mix the order of events around by introducing Clary's special rune ability, introducing vaguely Simon's vampirism and just basically give away a lot of important information which is supposed to create suspense for another couple of books. -Numerous things were changed such as Simon was never made into a mouse in the film, just kidnapped, in the film they bring Clary and Jace's family relation into it by saying that it was Hodge's idea to tell the lie, Jace saves Clary from the monster at the start, Clary is drawing some weird sign all the time, Hodge never gives an unconscious Jace to Valentine to take to that abandoned hospital thing and in the end Clary is the saviour by pushing Valentine into this weird jelly door thing. -Scenes such as the one in the greenhouse at midnight were made totally cringey and difficult to watch due to unconvincing CGI and terrible acting, about 80% of the film was just very cringeyIn fact, the only good people in it were Jocelyn and Simon.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
208,citrus-istari,An incestual love story disguised as fantasy story.,1,12 October 2013,"Wow, how horrible this movie was. Riddled with plot holes that a 1st grader should be able to point out. Where to begin.1. Demons are ""affected"" by music. OK cool, no problem. It's too bad the characters in the movie ignore this... The scene where the black witch lady is a demon, Jace nearly plays the whole song on piano and still does NOTHING until Clair is attacked by her.. seriously the old lady tweaking out when you were playing the song for 5 minutes wasn't a good enough clue? 2. Hmm, Simon can suddenly see without his glasses but nobody really cares, I mean that's totally normal right? People that need glasses usually just magically one day can see perfectly without them... Not to mention his bite marks that go unnoticed, nobody thought to check him after he was captured by vampires? 3. The ""shadow hunters"" are a bunch of bitchy adolescent hormonal teenagers, and they're suppose to be the ones to save the world from demons? Ha, give me a break, they're too busy with their incest/gay love triangle to notice anything actually going on in the story.4. The entire first half of the movie is just about how Simon loves Clair but Clair is falling for Jace(who is her brother) and the other dude is gay for Jace... what? Why is that even needed in the plot at all? Do yourselves a favor and never see this movie, you'll regret it if you do.

However, the actress,the scenario were not that good.I wonder, why WHY would these talented actress did this job? I expected the best from them! But I must say Robert Sheehan did a great job. I did not read the book, but I understood it from the movie. I may read the book because as I saidthe story is great one and it did get my attention.Finally, I would really appreciate if they make it more real.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
212,dolf_wega,Read the books (all of them) first!,4,28 June 2014,"The most important flaw in this movie is that it gives away a major spoiler for those reading the books. Something's said that in the books you don't know until the third or fourth book, so that was a major let down for me. I don't know if they did it because they didn't intend to make sequel movies. But it's really annoying if you haven't read the whole series yet and they give things like this away. This to me was such a disappointment I would almost forget I enjoyed watching the movie pretty much. Because besides that, the movie isn't awful, they follow the line of the book pretty good. Acting could have been better but was okay. So, if you're into this kind of movies, it's quite entertaining . But if you prefer to also read the books: read them first. The whole series, or you'll be just as disappointed as I was.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones

214,GrimNirTheGreyGod,Brilliant film - do not compare it with others it stands alone.,10,2 September 2013,"First of all too the dissenters:- THIS FILM BARES NO Resemblance TO TWIGHLIGHT - ITS NOT SUPPOSED TOO, WAS NEVER INTENDED TO DO SO AND IS A BRILLIANT FILM THAT STANDS ALONE ON ITS OWN MERIT- Just because they are based in the same genre people compare them, but its like comparing News Night with Bugs Bunny. Twighlight was intended as a romance novel but set in a world with vampires to make it an impossible love, sigh swoon, hmmm. Mortal Instruements was intended as an action fantasy novel which happened to have a romantic interest which could be subtly twisted to add to the plot.And to those who decry that its not a true representation of how they pictured it whilst reading the book. Get over yourselves. Books can explore and vocalise characters thoughts and feelings, they are not restricted by the law of physics or possibility and they have greater depth and length. Its almost impossible to fit in every aspect of a decent sized book unless the movie lasts 6-12 hours plus. You can not vocalise every characters thoughts and feelings in a film, and there are loads of other problems too. Not least budget and believability. Its always the fans of fantasy fiction or comic books that get so worked up on the minuscules that they fail to appreciate a decent movie. Look at the Bourne movies, apart from parts of the first one they didn't bother to attempt to follow the plots of their namesake books yet people managed to appreciate both the books and the movies.Saying that this is a decent representation of the book and I enjoyed both book and film equally.THE REVIEW This is a young adults fantasy action book so the stars are young, however the acting was of a very high standard. All the actors managed to portray a depth of character, that was both compelling and believable. They drew you into the film and plot and kept you riveted. The acting was then complimented with awesome special effects that blended seamlessly into the movie. The demons where excellently crafted, scary and threatening enough to add the edge of danger to the action scenes without overwhelming the scene. Jamie Campbell Bower may have a slight physique but he was able to pull off the wiry, agile, fast, action hero competently and believably, and complimented Lily Collins character exceptionally well. The chemistry was there. The supporting cast's performance was also of a high standard which really made this film stand out as an all time great film.The film starts out with Lily Collins character being a normal teenage girl who gets quickly and violently pulled into a darker world where all the night mares and scary stories are really true. At the same time it sets up the back story, the plot and outlines the new world she has been drawn into. But it manages too do this in a compelling fashion. Its not just a boring info dump that you have too endure until you get to the move proper. It compliments and balances the rest of the movie. Something that a lot of other movies fail to do. The Action increases as the film progresses, and although its really impressive action scenes, (which maybe could have been drawn out bit longer for those of us addicted to high octane action) they do not overwhelm the plot or the character development. There are lulls between action scenes that drive character development and clarify plot points but do so naturally, nothing feels forced, faked or rushed, whilst still maintaining an edge of urgency.The Script writer was an absolute genius. There are some action films that deliberately set up a one liner, a humorous quip for the audiences amusement and pleasure but often do so by crow barring it into the scene, with no attempt at subtlety. Whilst this movie lacks the classic one liner in the conventional sense, it did however contain numerous memorable and humorous lines that are instantly quotable. The word by play between the good guys was often funny, cheeky, and very compelling, but it also felt natural and heartfelt.I could find only one fault with this film, and that was when I left the theatre I was instantly depressed because I have to wait for the next film to be made before I can watch it.Do not miss this film, it is simply one of the all time greats.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
215,kristma7,not as good as I expected,6,15 September 2013,"It had almost nothing to do with the book. Just the basic idea was the same. Also I think that Jamie Campbell Bower wasn't the best choice for the role. Other options such as Xavier Samuel or Douglas Booth who both auditioned for the role perhaps would have been a better choice.I read the books and I think that the movie should have been outstanding based on that plot. Instead, they changed everything making it much less interesting.One good thing about the movie is that it contains a lot of action and that Lily Collins is a very good choice for the role of Claire. Jocelyn and Isabelle and maybe Simon are quite as described in the book but, the rest of the cast was not as representative as I expected.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
216,HorusEye,All the same old but with a new haircut.,6,28 January 2014,"I enjoyed this film although I'm in no ways its target audience. It's a teen film, primarily for chicks, but I'm having a cold and my wife isn't home, so perhaps I'm a little more sentimental than usual.It starts off like any other coming of age yarn. Clary, our protagonist, is littering the house with drawings of her womb, a clear sign that she's on the verge of Growing Up. Luckily, she runs into the right people first, and they teach her what she needs to know about tattoos and black outfits with buckled boots, and all that other stuff that makes you cool and adult. A romance story is fired up right away as well, between Clary and this guy Jonathan with the cool sticky hair and silky British voice, and the two seem a little naive in that they don't pick up on each other's signals, but I guess that takes some life experience.The story is very simple, utilizing all the expected elements of the genre, but does manage to keep them fairly fresh, and the plot has sufficient twists to stay interesting, although most of them have only minor impact on later turns of events. At some points it meanders a little and several scenes could have been cut out without affecting the plot at all. It would have suited the film to be a little bit shorter.The characters are all exceptionally pretty people, and most of them have no character flaws either, yet it didn't become annoying like it very easily does in such cases. Clary is sympathetic enough for one to care about her, and it helps keeping you involved in the story despite the often predictable setup.All in all, it had good entertainment value, and I think I only zoned out briefly a couple of times. Worth a watch, just don't expect anything from the Deep End of the pool.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones

But why is the money (producers) afraid to do anything bold? Why not hire a director who actually has an idea how not to make another boring linear 'mistery' walk-through for the audience.Cheap characters, cheap thrills, fake drama and bad acting. An insult to any intelligent human. A waste of time for anyone that didn't enjoy that twilight crap. I'm now 58 minutes into the movie and I'm pulling the plug.

218,adizzy,I am so disappointed,3,4 December 2013,"I've read the books and so love d the story, and I couldn't wait to see the movie, but the reviews I saw after the movie was initially lunched made me want to postpone watching the movie. Oh my!! I am so disappointed! I was expecting specific scenes from the book, couldn't wait to see them live and ...and there they weren't. No super evil grater demon appearing at madam Dorothea and the whole story was messy. Valentine comes to take the cup and talks to Clary, in the book they don't interact in that scene. A lot of stuff was just wrong for me. Maybe if I would have just watch the movie and read the book later, then it would have been OK, but no! It was bad! And rather bad acting too, and Jonathan Rhys Meyers is one of my favorite actors, but the way he portraits Valentine is just...i don't know, I actually understood the reasons Valentine had ..in the book, he really thought he was doing a good thing, but Valentine in the movie, I can't really understand him, see behind the action and see his ""wrong"" reasons.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
219,lovesitxo,Another View Of The Book,8,16 September 2013,"I just started reading the series about a month ago so I'm new to the whole Mortal Instruments scene.A book can never translate well into a movie due to time restraint. Also a movie needs to be visually pleasing. I think if Clare had been more involved with the movie making (Like Stephanie Myers was for Twilight) maybe die-hards of the books would think this movie was better. I think the books are great but after reading the first book - after spending many late nights not being able to put it down - I felt a little let down. I needed more ... I was very, very pleasantly surprised to see that the movie gave me the MORE I was searching for. I think the movie (and hopefully the series if the other movies get made) are a wonderful adaptation of the books. Do not go into this expecting to see the book word for word but except to see a wonderful depiction of the story told thru a different set of eyes and I mean that in the best way possible. This is a very good film and it completely left me wanting MORE but a good kind of more. I immediately dove into the rest of the books and am anticipating the second film.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
220,howens-1,So where are the flying monkeys?,2,31 August 2015,"An important style hint for good Science Fiction writing is not to introduce too many SF elements in one story. The same should apply to fantasy writing.I haven't read any books in this series yet. This film may save me from that experience.An ordinary teenager discovers that her family isn't ordinary at all: her mother is a secret warrior in the battle between Good and Evil.If the author had left it at that, with one kind of supernatural protagonist or villain, I might have been satisfied. It didn't work out that way. We are introduced to all the standard Urban Fantasy memes as well. At any moment I expected a kitchen sink to fall out of the rafters.So while the audience isn't in Kansas anymore, we haven't reached Oz. This film had little to distinguish it from so many others.At least no elves. Maybe that's waiting for the sequel.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
221,sasha-tifton,"Worse than Twilight, and I loathed Twilight.",1,13 October 2013,"--- SPOILERS AHEAD ---I watched this fim with a friend who has never read the book. I, on the other hand, read it years ago, but wasn't interested enough to continue with the series. However, I was willing to judge it as a film on its own merits, not as a book adaptation. By the end of the movie, we were left disappointed. It was rushed, choppy, unevenly paced, and made no effort to define the world it was set in. All the characters could have died and we would have felt nothing because the film did little to make us care them.FLAWS IN THE FILM:The script was so atrocious that we began predicting what characters would say next during the cheesiest scenes. 95% of the time, we were right - word for word. When Jace said to Clary, ""I told you I'd never met an angel"", I said, ""Please, for the love of god, don't say: 'now I have'"". He did. We died a little. There was zero character development. Clary had no personality. When we tried to describe her, we could not come up with a single adjective as we knew nothing about this girl. (Actually, that's a lie. When she pulled the mortal cup out of the card in front of the witch who was obviously a demon, and then again in front of Hodge, my friend yelled, ""How are you so STUPID?"".) Clary was presented as the protagonist even though we were given no reason to root for her or care about her. We. Knew. Zilch. About. Her. (Beyond being prone to dumb and reckless behavior). It didn't help that Lily Collins, while pretty, has no on-screen charisma. She was just a bland attractive girl. The other characters suffered equally. We could tell that Simon was nerdy, Isabelle liked slutty clothes and fighting, Valentine was evil, Hodge was sketchy, Luke was some kind of family friend (why, who knows?) and Jace was the standard romantic lead with a penchant for sappy lines and rescuing Clary. Beyond that, nothing. Words like 'the Clave', 'the accord', and others were thrown in without explanation. We were expected to believe that the mortal cup was some kind of holy grail even though the movie hardly explained how it functioned beyond a couple of statements about its necessity for making more shadow hunters. After all the build up with no clarification, my friend began to expect that the cup's powers would be demonstrated at the climax, making things clearer. Of course, this did not happen, and she was left unsatisfied. We cared about the mortal cup as much as we cared about the characters - which is to say, not at all.The Silent Brothers were never explained. They were just creepy dudes living under a graveyard.The weapons were ill-defined. They just did whatever the characters needed them to do at any given time - be it tattooing runes, slaying demons, or drilling magical peepholes through bookcases. They might as well have been Harry Potter wands.Clary inexplicably accuses Alec of being in love with Jace even though we saw no indication that he was even gay. The Clary and Jace romance felt forced. There was no build up. We were never shown why he would be attracted to her, or why she returned those feelings. When they finally kissed in the garden, it was uncomfortably awkward.In a seemingly random act, Valentine wanted Clary to drink his blood from the cup and no one knew why. Said my friend at this point: ""Is he Jesus?""Loose ends. Simon is bitten by a vampire. At no point in the film does anybody bother to tell him this. Even when he storms out of the institute, Clary doesn't think to say, ""By the way, a vampire bit you."" We waited for the effects of the bite to manifest - to find out if he was a vampire or not. But in the end, we were forced to conclude that in the world of The Mortal Instruments, being bitten by vampires only improves your eyesight. The werewolves only existed to serve as expendable extras in fight scenes.Speaking of fight scenes, many went on for far too long. Time could have been better spent on character development so that we actually cared if anyone died in a fight. In the ultimate deus ex machina, Clary draws a rune that freezes all the demons. No one else has ever seen this rune. No one figures out how Clary knows how to draw it. It was like the screenwriters realized that their heroine had been useless and needed her to do something powerful to prove why she's the protagonist, since her talents thus far largely involved leading others into mortal peril.Why were they using fire to battle demons that looked as if they were made essentially out of fire? Do we spray water to stop a flood?The portal in the wall was supposed to take someone to the place they focused on or keep them in limbo. How did Valentine reach out of the portal to grab Clary after he gets shoved in?Clary draws a cleaning rune at the end of the movie and magically tidies her apartment. At that point, it just became ridiculous. Are there runes to trim cat toenails and enable WIFI as well?I thought the whole Twilight franchise was awful but despite the dreadfulness of those movies, the plot was never unclear to even those with IQ deficiencies. I can't say the same about The Mortal Instruments.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
222,Jorge_2005,Mediocre,6,7 September 2013,"Acting: fine in my opinion (but I am lenient). Special effects: my girlfriend seemed to be very scared of some scenes. I was only very slightly scared, but I have been desensitized after watching some horrible movies (which I now regret).I did not like the story. It did not move (or maybe the word is ""convince"") me. I also did not learn anything. I found the characters to be shallow, uninteresting. I prefer interesting characters like Christopher Nolan's Batman and Joker or like the jurors in 12 Angry Men. In contrast this movie was just about fantasy, surprise, action, lots of special effects.Regarding the action, I found it unrealistic and unconvincing. I like realistic, convincing action like that of Elite Squad.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
223,ajcomputer2003,"Clary Fray finds herself a part of a world unknown to her, or rather, hidden from her.",7,22 August 2013,"As one who has read the books, I must say that I am not disappointed with the way the movie was made. There were plenty of things that were mentioned in the book changed and removed in the adaptation in order for the movie not to be too long or too short. In fact, the changes were quite understandable, especially since the creators still managed to give knowledge well to both those who have read it and those who haven't. However, there was one line, which was probably noticed by most of the readers who have seen the movie, that completely ruins a certain surprise. That, I think is City of Bones' major flaw as a book-based movie. Aside from that, the movie is still great, nonetheless. Enjoyable and not boring, with an evenly mixed blend of wit and seriousness. I would recommend watching the movie in IMAX (something that I failed to do) because of the great and nearly realistic effects. The demons were really awesome, though they failed to give a better image of greater demons (mainly because they did not mention greater demons). The soundtrack was good! It was well balanced by pop/electronica such as Zedd's ""Into The Lair"" or Demi Lovato's ""Heart by Heart"", which was conveniently played at a very beautiful scene, might I add. Aside from the plot, the best thing about City of Bones was the acting. Many people complained about some actors being stiff and inappropriate for the role, but I assure that they were not. Lily was the best actress in the movie whereas Robert was the best actor. They acted so naturally yet they stole the viewers' attention. Many people doubted Jamie (some still do), but the way he acted actually carried out Jace's egoistic poise. Another actor that was criticized was Jonathan Rhys Meyers as Valentine. I think he, too, portrayed the villain well enough to be considered as, well, a villain. Valentine, in my perception and opinion, was really somewhat a madman who craved for power, and that's how Jonathan acted in the movie, if not overly-acted. Bottom-line: City of Bones is not a ""screw-up"" despite it being based off of a book. It's neither Twilight nor Harry Potter (although if I were Cassandra Clare, I'd be honored to have my series compared to Harry Potter); it's The Mortal Instruments, and City of Bones is just the start. 7/10",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones

Not the red hair on Clary I was expecting and she didn't have green eyes. And I loved Jace's features in the book with his gold eyes--this guy had blue eyes. Horribly disappointed. I know he turned it down, but I'm positive Alex Pettyfer could've pulled the Jace role off perfectly. The lines--the jokes really--were delivered drolly and not funny like in the book. I'm, like, positive they took eight chapters or whatever and condensed those many chapters into ten minutes of this movie. Sorely unhappy. And they changed EVERYTHING!! They even took parts that should've been in the beginning and put them in the middle. It was too . . . different and not what I expected. I wanted to see Valentine with the white hair as described in the book--he looks nothing like described in the book. Not even close. Alec was an asshole and I remember Magnus being a little more subtle in the book when it came to Alec. And I guess I don't mind the accents, but it probably would've been better without them. I also imagined Bill Nighy as Hodge, but can't exactly change that. The way the lines were delivered was horrible and I just saw a lot of scenes where the acting was over-dramatized.

Some may agree, some may not... but most people laugh at my uncensored, straight up, honest opinions. What can I say... ""I DO WHAT I WANT!"" HA! With that said.. here is my review on City of Bones..Summer Movie Marathon #28... ""The Mortal Instruments... City Of Bones"" Well well well....This movie surprised me! ! All summer I have been reading this 4 book, soon to be 5 book series, so I was going into this with high expectations!! They were all mostly met and then some! Let me start off with the cast. Lily Collins thoroughly impressed me. She is a very talented actress whom I see going very far in her career and being paired up with Jamie Cambell Bower was icing on the cake! I have watched him in many movies and I am indeed a fan! Therefor, I would have to say, Jamie and Lily carried this movie very well as the lead characters! The chemistry was on point, they nailed the infamous ""Greenhouse"" scene to where I was super giddy like a teenager, (hahaha) and they look great together! To bad there off screen romance has come to an end! This movie followed the book pretty much to the T... except for a few changes that at first, I felt was unnecessary. I mean, I have never been one to be annoyed with veering off from the book, but I found myself a little irritated with the changes that were made. BUT... after talking with many friends and fans of this series, I am more understanding of why ""the Big Reveal"" was told in this first film. Although... it stills annoys me that I had to get through 3 books and many frustrated sleepless nights to find out the big secret, but I do understand the thought process of catering to the audience that are drawn to this movie and the fact that it is only rated PG13. With all that said... I am extremely pleased with the way this movie turned out AND I CANNOT wait for part 2... City of Ashes, which comes out in 1024. I give this movie 8 out of 10 stars... GO SEE IT in theaters, it was way worth the $10 I had to spend for a movie ticket! (sorry Cinema City... haven't had to do that in a long time)",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones

I had very good hopes about the movie because I have to admit that they did a good job making the trailer. Cassandra Clare did an amazing job in the book, but they changed so many things in the adaptation. Instead of going to the back room (or whatever it is called) in the Pandemonium, the Shadowhunters killed the demon in the club. When Simon is kidnapped by the vampires, he should've been turned into a rat, but no. The vampires just took him and hung him.

My favourite character from the book and film is Jace as he was so witty and he was really witty in the film which is good. Story line: The story in this film is all very cramped together as the book was quite big so i think the screenwriter done a good job fitting it all in the 2 hours.

There is good acting from the two main characters and humour to keep the film from being too serious. The reviews are way too harsh which I think is because these critics seem to be forgetting that this film IS aimed at a YOUNGER audience. That doesn't mean adults won't like it but it just means older people have to be more open minded when watching it. There are great CGI effects which in my opinion are very realistic and the twist at the end is very entertaining. Robert Sheehan also totally rocks in this film!!!,The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
233,Jazzie2906,Not Perfect but a good first try,9,23 August 2013,"I went in both excited and reluctant. For one people who haven't read the book and watch the movie and hated it, then it ruins the books reputation which is quite stupid because the books were amazing. Bits they changed or left, that annoyed me:1. There was no chemistry between Jace and Clary 2. Valentine was not like book valentine at all. Book Valentine is sleek, commanding but persuasive. Movie Valentine was just violent and not persuasive. 3. Why didn't Simon turn into a rat? Having the bite marks on his arm. Was just obvious and super cheesy 4. Why didn't Simon need his glasses? He isn't a full-vampire yet and correct if I am wrong but I thought the perks come in after he turns 5. Where was Jace's cocky smile and humor? Jace's humor was dry and Jace was way too serious to be Jace. He hardly ever smiled, which I found to be totally un-Jace. 6. Never in this movie do they mention fairies. When Isabelle is naming all the Downworlders she misses out Faeries. Which we know is a big part in the next book. I wonder how they're going to explain that. 7. What the hell was up with that portal? Am i the only one, who found the portal completely stupid and un-book like. Firstly, did I miss the bit where you can just take a bit of the portal out. Secondly, Jace didn't need to say that she needed training, cause it makes him sound dumb when she can use it to go to Luke's house. Thirdly, Jace said the Institute was built around the portal. What? We all know Henry created them, so that made no sense to me. And Lastly I get that the portal exploded and it snowed but it continued to snow after they destroyed 8. When Clary freezes the demons with her rune she made. Why didn't they kill them all while they were frozen? They had to wait a good 20 seconds just staring at them and THEN decided to sneak past them even though they were frozen. They basically just stood there waiting for them to wake up. Is there logic there? 9. They never explained what a censor is. (They used one.) 10. Never explained what a Steele is. What I imagined if I hadn't read the books: They are getting out their giant glowing pens and burning themselves with it. 11. Magnus looked like Magnus but it didn't feel like Magnus. 12. Where did the demon energy-vampire motorcycle scene go? :( 13. What did Valentine hope to achieve by having Clary drink his blood? The Mortal Cup is used to make people shadow hunters. Isn't Clary already one? 14. Never explained what runes really are 15. What was up with Clary fixing up her apartment? When did she turn into Marry Poppins or Matilda? That is NOT what ruins are for. They're NOT to help you tidy up your stupid house. Duh. 16. Didn't feel the connection between the three 'siblings' felt it between Alec and Isabelle. It felt like they couldn't stand Jace half the time. 17. Where was the explanation of parabatai? I was waiting for them to mention that Alec and Jace were and for them to explain what it means. But, no. 18. Where was the scene where Clary slapped Jace? When she slaps him for putting the rune on her 19. I thought that ALL the Lightwoods lived at the Institute. But they said that they are the only people living there and never mentioned them or did Clary or Simon ask about them. 20. The Circle wasn't explained well. I thought it was just mushed and I couldn't see anything. And I wanted them to make more reference to it 21. They also never went to Taki's. Why? 22. I would've like Simon to at least mention his band 23. Where was Magnus' cat? 24. When valentine was talking about ""How do you think you got your gifts, Clary?"" Duh, she doesn't know she has gifts yet. Idiot! She doesn't know what she's capable of yet. 25. When Jocelyn drinks that liquid from the box. I couldn't even read the 'J.C' carved into it. It was too fast and I felt like they really needed the bit at the start where she cries over the lock of hair. By the time we figure it says 'J.C'. It's too late. 26. When Clary throws the knife at Luke in werewolf form. That felt really unneeded (considering werewolf's cant climb ladders) and very awkward. 27. Why couldn't the name 'Bane' pop up in Clary's head like in the book? Instead she had to write demented lines. That Jace miraculously figured out it meant 'Bane' in some weird symbol language. 28. Silent Brothers Mind Speak thing? Don't get me wrong, i liked how they did it but they didn't explain what happened. All we knew was that there was a creepy voice talking. Also, Why didn't she react. I mean, does she get mind spoken to on a daily basis that she has no reaction. 29. Where the hell was Church?But there were bits I loved!1. Jace does that epic flip 2. The seeds of Isabella and Simon's relationship 3. Just Simon all together 4. How bad ass was Isabelle? Seriously. 5. Just the entire Hotel Dumont Scene was just thrilling to the end. 6. THE DEMONS!!! Quality CGI. 7. Valentine and Jace's fight scene was epic. 8. Silent Brothers Mind Speak was not cheesy at all. 9. Silent brothers were creepy as hell and were so well done. *Clap* 10. Vampire were amazing, they were NOT cheesy and really brought the way concept that they are dangerous.Overall: Great movie, But should have followed the book more. I felt that this was only for fans of the book. And if you weren't, you would be completely confused.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones

All the actors were perfect the only problem i had was Jonathan Meyers is just not old enough in my opinion to be their dad. He pays an amazing part but it's hard to believe he is their father when he doesn't look much older than them. Hopefully they will stick more to the book next time, i know it's hard to include all things in under 2 hrs but i was that lost at the end i had no idea what was going on. Nothing was mentioned about Jace and Alec being bound and wasn't explained how Luke became a werewolf. Hopefully it does well so we can get a better second movie!",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
236,gabagosin2,good... needed character development!,6,4 September 2013,"As someone who read the book it was a bit of a let down, but the movie was good. The change in storyline from the book wasn't too bad but the problem was, there was no character development. The best actor/character was Simon with or without reading the book it was obvious, and Lily Collins did a surprisingly good job at Clary's character at the beginning. Jace needed more emotion, he was dull and had no personality, when they tried to give him a bit of that jackass/obnoxious feel it was just a flop... The beginning was good, Clary showed a lot of her personality as did others but the characters fell from there.Overall the movie was enjoyable, effects were good. The music was a let down, when Clary and Jace kissed for the first time it needed a better song choice, maybe even piece of music without words, its not a Taylor swift movie... Valentine needed to be a bit older looking and the character needed to be a bit less violent, a bit more contained so that people were suspicious of him, and it would be easier for him to confuse/manipulate others. Rather than knowing he has a short fuse: actor choice wasn't good..As someone who read the book: the silent brothers needed to look worse, more mutilated and creepy.Character Development is all I have to say... hoping the next one will be better.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
237,aydonis,Mindless,5,28 August 2014,"Took a couple tries to finally make it through this movie. The characters have little to no history, connection, development. I had a hard time feeling anything for anyone in the movie.A decent cast (though the script was beyond dull), at least Lily Collins is pretty to look at.Nice CGI. At least the emotionless progression of the characters from one action scene to the next is highlighted with some pretty sights.A slightly different take on some interesting (if over-done) legends/fantasies, but little reason to care about any of it.It's a shame really, seemed like it could have been a good movie, but it just felt rushed with one-dimensional characters and no reason to remain interested. By the end I just wanted Satan himself to pop up, grab the cup, and eat everything in sight to at least give it an interesting twist.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
238,dewimutiah,delivers its promises on supernatural adventures and bad-ass action sequences,6,29 August 2013,"I read the book, the first one. The story is standard YA type. Took several aspect of former YA fictions, such as Harry Potter, Percy Jackson, and Twilight. But the movie crews really did try to make the movie interesting to watch. Why I said so? (Here's some examples)1. Similar as Percy Jackson, Half blood, but in here half angel, half human, called shadow-hunters/ demon hunters (Jace said) and protecting the world by hunting and killing demons with several type of glass sword, fire-blower, unique gun to kill vampire, (I like this idea, it's more modern than twilight.)2. Why Harry Potter? The Institute looks like Hogswarts. With Hodge (maybe the principal of the institute) having birds like Dumbledore. And the runes (it's like spells with strange symbols applied on skin to give additional powers) and to create it, they need the 'stele' (like wand). The way Clary (Lily Collins) clean her house with the rune applied on her skin was just like the way Dumbledore cleaning Slughorn's house in HP6. I don't know why there are too many of it reminds me to Harry Potter when I didn't even try to compare.3.Twilight, mostly because of the love triangle. In love with powerful, different-kind of human who she barely knew and challenged by her best friend's love and the fight between vampire- werewolf.This kind of storyline, we can't put the blame on the movie crews. They were just adapting a book. Harald Zwart did try to give us the excitement by putting a lot of action sequences. Jamie Campbell Bower (Jace Wayland) and Jemima West (Isabelle) did wonderful job on this. They stole my attention. Bad ass.Kevin Zegers (Alec) and Godfrey Gao (Magnus) are less than expected. Their acting isn't good. Jonathan Rhys Meyer (Valentine) seems to kind to be a villain. Hodge is more look like a villain than Valentine, and I thought it supposed to be otherwise.The script is uneven. I could get it. The complexities of 500 pages book is hard to compress in 2 hours movies with almost an hour of action sequences. It's too many informations to take for the first hour. If I haven't read the book, it would be pretty hard to understand the shadow hunter world.My opinion about the movies: 1.The story is not so good, very predictable, and cheesy twist. (but blame the book's author for that if you don't like/enjoy it)2.The script, I found Jessica Postigo pretty good to add some info not related to the book but it's enough to support the change they did for the movie storyline. 3.The cast, I don't agree on Valentine, like I've said before. And his hair. (SPOILER) Valentine must be blond. it's weird the ending with none of both parents are blond (Valentine hair is black in the movie), related to the fact who his son is, you'll find out why by watching the movie. Clary and Jace seemed believe it. Stupid.4.The acting is fair. Kevin Zegers should look tougher and killer, that's the way Alec does. 5. The fighting choreography is good. 6. The animation, creatures, effects are impressive. Well done.7. The soundtrack's little bit annoying because I don't think it fits the theme of the scene. The score of the fight in Dumort Hotel sounds like a night club, maybe if they added thrilling music for this scene, the audience would feel the thrill. First, not fit, and too loud. It's not a back-sound, more like Demi Lovato's clip video.8. It has all supernatural aspects, werewolves, vampires, demons, warlocks and witches.Okay, summaries:This movies isn't the next twilight. The adventure suits for Harry Potter fans. The action is dominating the movies, so guys and adults can go enjoy this movie. I don't think this movie would attract wider audience, because of 'the next Twilight' paradigm, but I'm telling you, this movie brought more value than that. They're fighting against demons and evil to protect the world, not just a girl's obsession to live forever with her vampire lover.It's not a very good movie. but I recommend you to put on your watch-list, it's pretty entertaining.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
239,WarlockBane,Go see it :),10,31 August 2013,"To me, being a fan of the books, I found this movie very nicely done. When I go see a book-to-movie adaptation, I keep in mind to keep the book as separately as possible from the movie unless you're Beautiful Creatures ( no offense). But, seeing TMI made me view the book differently and I loved it. It was like, ""What if the characters did this instead in this situation versus the book's situation at hand?"". They took a lot out, yes, but what they added, I think made up for what was removed and they didn't stray from the story line. I say go see it and if you don't like it, hey that's your choice but I recommend watching this movie ( if you've read the books) with an open mind.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
240,flamingphoenyx,Awesome movie wrong time,10,23 April 2014,"THis movie was awesome and should have hit number 1. But the introduction of the series to the world not so good on timing a such with movies like beautiful creatures. This along with about 8 other movies needs to be reintroduced, Especially with the new topics of angels and demons and love this just takes the cake. but this seems like a summertime movie and with harry potter and twilight now over now would the time to put this movie back on racks back in dollar theaters or as a second chance in regular theaters especially imax. THe story line is a bit iffy and some scenes tend to be rushed or not well explained. Some of the graphics could use a bit of upgrading(seems like they were bent on style more than graphics). Definitely needs some more rune scenes and some more seriousness, most of the scenes seemed to be focused on sadness or cheesy love lines, and a little bit of incestuous love. Overall this is a good movie the first movies in a series are usually the worst and its trial and error, so we have pointed out errors but that just leaves all the room to improve.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones

There's magic, vampires, werewolves, demons, shadow hunters and so on and there's a place for everybody. It's not working in the movie. Why? There's so much they want to show and tell us in so little time and everything just gets messed up. Some important stuff aren't even explained and I'm just.. why? how?I like the characters and the cast is OK but I have a few problems with Lily Collins.

Fight at the end all wrong. Hodge, Simon, and many more things all wrong. Some crucial things and characters very important for the story missing.

This one had a lot of action and good effects but was not available in 3-D although it was available in IMAX. I'll pay extra for 3D but not for Imax alone.Decent enough story line. After watching for a while I kind of figured it was some kind of book like the Twilight / Hunger Games type movies. They tried to weave in some love scenes which added nothing to the movie. Some campy love song with the main characters kissing. I believe it only confused things. Maybe it will make sense in the sequel. Good, fast paced entertainment for 2 hours.

246,b-duchaine,Critics are too harsh,8,22 August 2013,"Don't get me wrong, no movie adaptation of a novel is going to be perfect and make everyone happy, but I feel as though the critics have been way too harsh on this movie and it's actors/actresses. Though, this seems like a trend with YA movies, beside Harry Potter I tend to see critics rip and tear apart teen movies like birds feasting on a dead carcass...I swear they all get together and decide to do it as a group. (just saying) Anyhow, I wouldn't say TMI was perfect, but it was the first in the series and I hope they get a chance to fix their minor mistakes and release City of Ashes. I enjoyed that book and would love to see it brought to life.The actors: I did not see anything wrong with any of them save the actor who played Magnus Bane, he wasn't terrible, but definitely lacked the personality that he had in the books. His character always made me laugh and I guess Godfrey Gao kind of fell a little flat and almost mechanic on screen. I thought everyone else fit well and acted well, I don't see the issues that many others seem to see. I'm no film critic, but I am a fan and a lover of movies.The Plot: Although most of the movie seemed to stick with the book they surprisingly changed a lot at the end. For example, Hodge telling Valentine to lie to Clary and Jace about being sister and brother versus Hodge actually believing that they were brother and sister after Valentine tells him this. I guess I can understand why they did it, but it, to me, did not have that gut wrenching ""oh crap!"" moment I felt when reading the books, even though as a reader I hoped and kind of figured it wasn't true, especially when the character of Sebastian shows up, it all starts to piece together from there. Though, I cannot understand why they did it...the incest reason? In case they never made another movie? Fear of confusing people? I don't know, I wasn't a fan, but the changes like this one definitely did not ruin the movie for me.I enjoyed the action sequences and even thought the ""cheesey"" romance scene in the garden was kind of cute, I thought the kiss between Jace and Clary was pretty passionate and personally felt as though Lily Collins and Jamie Campbell Bower had good chemistry. (I have to admit I liked Jamie already from his role on Camelot) Well, this is just my opinion and two cents I just really hope that the movie itself does well with the fans and that a second film is made because I, for one will be devastated to see such an amazing series from such an incredible author be shut down after only one movie. :(",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
247,darksilklips,Magnus Bane is amazingly hot... that's about it.,1,6 September 2013,"Damn, that warlock is fine as cat hair. He does a arse-poor job like most of the actors in this film, but he rocks the makeup and Daisy Dukes without looking trans at all. I'm kind of awed.Aside from that, this film is absolute rubbish. You can't even help talking through it. And since there will only be two other people in the theater at best, you'll probably (as I did) spend the whole film a- flaming away. Which is kind of fun in its own way, I suppose. But in this case so not worth it!!!If you didn't read the books, you'll be completely confused. I'm absolutely positive of this since I HAVE read the books and still felt completely lost about two thirds of the way in. There's a sort of point, right in that spot, where they begin to deviate from the plot of the book. The film just kind of staggers about like a drunk trying to reassemble a porcelain cup she or he has just up-ended and shattered. It was a very painful sort of torture to watch. I mean, the first book is pretty bad on its own, and this film... Pros? It had some beautiful scenes. One very beautiful man. (Not Jace, unfortunately -- Jaime Campbell-Bower looks like a caricature of a heroine-addicted pretty boy, and his mediocre acting skills only exacerbate this.) Absolutely delicious graphics in many of the scenes. Loved the institute especially.Cons?

248,IoneVi,"A bad, but entertaining movie",5,31 October 2013,"The movie was very entertaining, but also ridiculously bad. The main issue I had with this movie was definitely the screenplay; The story made little sense, subplots were left unanswered and the lines were cheesy and at times cringeworthy. The directing wasn't that good either with the pacing being too fast and cheesy songs unnecessarily inserted. Lastly the casting wasn't the best. The only person who did not have to audition for her role, leading lady Lily Collins, was unfortunately out acted by everybody else (well, bar Godfrey Goa) and leading man Jamie Campbell Bower was a bit too creepy and effeminate looking to be a convincing teen heartthrob.That being said, the movie itself was amusing (though perhaps not always for the best reasons), the fighting scenes were decent and the visual design of the demons were a job well done, so: 4/10.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones

When I heard there was going to be a movie about City Of Bones I thought how the hec will they manage that when the plot line in the books take forever to get into? Well they did manage it. This movie captures the author's world, sticks to the author's plot, but discards the 'randomness' for lack of a better word, that the book has. I loved the movie! The books were good but the movie was better that is my honest opinion.I fully recommend going and seeing it - and people who have read the book I advise keep an open mind, don't be overly critical, and enjoy it for what it is.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
250,sherica-csm,A good movie only if you didn't read the books.,6,19 September 2013,"I'm a fan of Cassandra Clare's Mortal Instruments series. In all honesty, the plot was a disappointment. There are so many vital details that are left out or altered horribly. The part where Simon was captured and taken because his drink was spiked by the vampires is utter rubbish, and deviated from the book horribly where he actually drank a blue cocktail and transformed into a rat. Simon was mistakenly taken to Hotel Dumort by the vampires. He turned into a vampire because he drank Raphael's blood. Only Jace and Clary went to save Simon at Hotel Dumort, not the whole group. No mention of the vampires' motorcycles either. And WHERE ON EARTH IS RAPHAEL?! He is a part of the book, and definitely plays a bigger role in the coming series. So does that mean Raphael is just gonna suddenly pop out in City of Ashes? No way man. Jamie Campbell Bowen was a poor choice to be Jace Wayland, for one. He didn't capture the character exactly. Jace Wayland is sarcastic, cocky and witty by nature, and in the movie, JCB ruined the character. Chemistry with Lily Collins was average. Unfortunately, Alex Pettyfer rejected the role so I guess they had to make do with JCB. Oh, and Clary's ability to create new runes has surfaced in CoB instead of CoA. WHAT? And isn't Valentine supposed to get the Mortal Cup at the end? For once, the bad guy won. Yet, Clary ""saves the world"" by giving Valentine the fake mortal cup and pushing him through the Portal at the Institute which Wasn't supposed to be there in the first place. (In the book, it was at Dorothea's and Renwicks) Fine. Clary creates a new rune and freezes the demons. They WALKED past the frozen demons instead of killing it, and then wait for them to unfreeze only to kill more werewolves. Idiots. Seraph blades wasn't mentioned in this film either. If the book constantly emphasized that Valentine has white hair, just give Valentine white hair goddammit. Felt that only Jocelyn and Magnus Bane stayed true to their characters. The rest were... meh. My friend who didn't read the book has thoroughly enjoyed this film while I was sitting there cussing in my head as the movie goes on.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
251,nac-mac-feegle71,Read the books and give the movie a pass,5,26 September 2013,"Possible spoilersI don't understand all the people saying fans of the books will love the movie. I love the books and thought this was really average. The exposition is clumsy and forced (and overly present). I understand that movies don't have the time to reveal background and develop characters the way books do but this could have been done better. The way they revealed Lily's mysterious ability was really poorly handled. If you're going to change the story away from the book then the change should be better, stronger but this change (and many others) wasn't. I also found the special effects quite ham-fisted in places and the vampires look ridiculous! They changed details (perhaps for budgetary reasons as they would have required more special effects scenes) that were essential (e.g. How Simon really ends up with the vampires) and the story wasn't logical as a result of the changes. The omission of certain scenes yet inclusion of characters (Alaric and the other wolves) that only really work if those omitted scenes are included also didn't help the storyline any. Also, where was Church? Lily Collins is great and Jamie Campbell Bower has his moments but many of the characters were cast too old and didn't do their characters any justice. When we meet Isabelle she looks like she's going on 30 yet in the books, Alec is the only one who's reached 18. Hodge is meant to be a contemporary of Valentine, Jocelyn and Luke but looks decades older. What was the purpose of such a deviation (given the actual back story of all these characters)? It isn't just the age either, they just weren't played with any depth or real emotion and I just couldn't get invested in them at all. Where was the true impact of the revelation Valentine drops on Clary and Jace, of Simon's time at Hotel Dumort, of Alec's unrequited feelings, of Isabelle's concern for her brother... I know films are made for a much wider audience than just fans of the book that has been adapted, but I don't think the film makers showed enough faith in the intelligence of their audience and its ability to grasp back story without it being thrust at them (bolded, underlined and italicised just in case you might miss it otherwise). The film ends up coming off as a poorly blended amalgam of other magical/other world type films, which is a shame as the world and characters created by Cassandra Clare deserve better.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones

Apparently she used to do HP fan fiction, shocking.Okay so we clarified, poor man's HP - but to top it off then she makes this weird incest thing between two of the main characters. Ermm Guess she's also a fan of star wars? Honestly the whole movie was just what it should be coming from this type of ""writer"" - a bunch of idea's taken from different movies and TV shows, thrown into one movie. I didn't see one original idea in the whole thing, but we all know that's a common theme now a days. The difference between this movie and other movies/shows that recycle old ideas is - this movie did it so bad it became uncomfortable to watch.Save your money, save your time.

The scenery especially is brilliant and very true to the books. Yes, a few bits are changed/missed out (such as Simon being turned in to a rat), but this happens with the vast majority of book to film adaptations. The books themselves are nothing like Twilight, they are far more engaging and draw you into a completely different world, twilight doesn't - I found the books a lot more intense - the film is also completely different! The acting is surprisingly good, I was extremely sceptical when I saw the confirmed cast, but they all seem to have made the characters their own. The on screen chemistry between Collins and Bower is very believable, far more intense and far superior to the Stewart-Pattinson romance. I hope they do make a sequel, I wasn't very impressed with the first twilight film, but they got better as the franchise continued.

254,gegeckaite-i,Not perfect but might be entertaining for many people,8,12 November 2013,"I am quite a tolerant person: I watch many things from time to time, even the ones I would actually complain about. This one is close to it, but not that much.Will you like the movie? Depends on what is your answer to these questions: * Did you like Twilight or any other movie from the same type? (As we clearly see, the new genre of Twilight type movies is rising and we can do nothing about it) * Do you like teenage oriented ""fantasy""/supernatural movies? * Do you like teenage oriented romance?If your answer to all the questions is completely no, then you shouldn't even consider watching this movie. Anyway, in my case I watched it, and my point of view - it was so better than Twilight. Not because it was perfect, but because Twilight was horribly too long with all the other strange traits of Twilight.It wasn't all scary, but the graphics were kind of worth watching, they almost persuaded me. For more used-to such type movies person it will not be scary in any minute of the movie (except one, I believe). But it was quite entertaining, full of some kind of tension (in a good way - my attention was at all times at the movie).Despite the completely lame romance scenes (you know, love triangles and so on), it was quite a movie of this genre. Giving it 8 out of 10, as such movie. It is that genre, it is supposed to be this way, and if there are many teenagers still in love with Twilight, this one will also fit into their loved ones.Not all predictable, and some of the characters were created quite well. Also, in some places the acting was very familiar with the reactions in real life, in my opinion.If you don't want to think too much today and you don't want to watch the movie that makes you think about the meaning of life, just want to spend your time doing something entertaining (and you kinda answered ""yes"" to my pointed out questions), then you can surely pick this movie. Don't expect too much though, and you will not be disappointed. After all, I am more glad than annoyed that I spent my time watching this.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones

I anticipated a YA /Twilight-esque fantasy and so I waited for it to come out on DVD because for $1.00 at Redbox, who cares if it's terrible? I have to say I was pleasantly surprised and then some. The acting is wonderful with an almost all-English cast. Lily Collins plays the heroine and Lena Headey as the Mother, John-Rhys Meyers as the Antagonist/Father (yes I did have a total fangirl moments when both made their first appearance on screen). Action was great and pacing was wonderful, I'm not entirely sure why everyone is being so critical. The only flaws I saw were a couple of plot points that got overlooked, possibly because they are going tie-in with sequels. Is this Shakespeare? No. But it is solidly acted, well-written within genre and best enjoyed when considering this is at its core a romantic/action movie with a fantasy backdrop!",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
256,rebelz1139,Highly Disappointed,1,11 December 2013,"I am a huge fan of the series, and having read all the books so far and was highly anticipating the movie. Boy was I disappointed. I found several things upsetting with this movie ""adaptation"" of the book. First and foremost as an overall it's a good thing I did read the book before watching the movie because the movie had no order. The movie did not follow a sensible time line and most events seemed out of place. Next the movie was ridiculously rushed. The movie seemed to go on and on forever, but the story line itself and the scenes were rushed! The scenes were not accurate given the descriptions on the book. The ""climax"" was %100 adapted to suit the movie. The characters were terrible! I know that the story is fictional, and so are the characters, but you could have found actors that suited the characters better. As far as the characters are concerned they were not portrayed as they were in the books. I saw no chemistry between them like there should have been. If you have not read the books I believe you would have a difficult time following along and really knowing what is going on or how the characters connect to one another. This movie sucks, plain and simple. I strongly hope there will not be another one.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
257,christogo88,First Movie,8,15 December 2013,"Well, this movie isn't to bad. I made the mistake of watching it before I read the book, never a good idea. Your mind is full all the actors faces and you can't let your imagination create them in your head. But I couldn't resist. I must admit tho that I'm a few chapters into the book and its a lot different from the movie. I like the book more, but that's normal. Movies never do the book justice. But as just a movie it was pretty good, good action, good story line, not half-bad acting, and pretty good special effects. All in all I rate this an 8/10. Worth the price of admission. I'm actually looking forward to seeing the second instalment of this series. This time tho I will be reading the books first :)",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
258,klimyin,Awesome Movie!,10,4 January 2014,"The movie was great! I have never read the book but, now that I've seen the movie I think I will. The story is great it has fiction, romance and action. It also had solid acting with good actors, they had a lot of emotion. Some of the people who read the book seemed disappointed, because the movie was so different from the book. If the movie was exactly like the book readers would know everything that was gonna happen as a result it would of been boring! So basically I think that they changed it to make it different/more interesting. Anyway, this movie was really good and I'm very excited for the next one to come out, hopefully it will be as good or even better maybe.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
259,Amywu101,What A Horrible Movie,2,8 January 2014,"Absolutely mortifying. I had high expectations of this movie, but when I went to watch it I was disappointed. I nearly fell asleep. Not to mention, the movie felt incomplete and unoriginal. It was like they copied word to word from the book.Here's come the worst part. The awful corny & cheesy lines was terrifying and I had to block my ears every time it happened. Also, Jamie's performance was equally bad.Overall, this story would have been a 1 if it hadn't included bombs, monsters and bloodsucking creatures.Bleh",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
260,nicole-yordan,I want more!,10,19 February 2014,"The first time I saw the trailer for this movie I brushed it off as kind of cheesy and didn't care to see it. A few months later I found myself looking for something to watch and saw this movie pop up on my Amazon Instant Video menu. I decided to rent it and give it a try. I had not read these books and I'm sure I passed up on them several times in the YA section.After the movie was over I couldn't believe how much I truly enjoyed this movie. I liked it so much and wanted to know what would happen to these characters that I went online and purchased the first three books, all of which I finished reading under a week. I fell in love with this series and cannot wait until City of Ashes comes out! If you enjoy YA movies you might like this, I did.I can understand how some of the characters are not as you might have imagined them to be if you read the books first but I think overall they did a good job. A few minor changes here and there.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
261,ceciliasunnetci,Not Worth Watching,2,26 April 2015,Another bad movie based off of a good book. How do you just change the entire plot? If you are going to have sequels why are you combining everything from the other books into one movie? And with that without any explanation on what the heck is going for the people that did not read the books. Why does Valentine have black hair when in all of the books they are constantly talking about how white his hair is? Why did you cast someone that looks like a crack addict for Jace? The girl that plays Clary doesn't know how to act. The guy that played Magnus seemed OK but the way he talked just seemed odd. Will not be watching the sequels because based off of this crap you know what it will be like.,The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
262,Scootinbabe,Potential not yet fulfilled,8,25 March 2014,"Never read the books before watching the movie as a rental, so I came in cold as a viewer. Here's the thing: it WAS laughably bad at times (I'm blaming the scriptwriters and editors for that), BUT...overall I found the film compelling and charming. I was left wanting to further explore the world of the Shadowhunters and see what unfolds in the future for the characters. I subsequently bought all four books, read them in a week and pre-ordered the upcoming one. That kinda says it all, doesn't it?What was bad: gosh awful sappy song and trite blossoming of flowers in greenhouse scene totally took me out of the moment; the confusingly motley array of supernatural elements and characters that were hurriedly introduced and not well explained; plus things like a portal in the Institute that has been there longer than the city of New York(?) and a stele that looks and acts like a sonic screwdriver. It's unfortunate enough that Tarot, dreams, swords, whips, silent brothers, witches, warlocks, shadow hunters, erased memories, alternative worlds, werewolves, vampires and more are a lot to swallow in one two-hour bite--especially for someone unfamiliar with the books. What was great: the casting. I LOVED the characters and the actors who played them. I couldn't read the books without seeing the actor's faces. Jamie Campbell Bower embodied Jace--haughty, sarcastic and arrogant, yet witty and charming to those he allows close-- and he looks ethereal enough to play a half-angel warrior. I also loved the look of the film: costumes, settings, props, lighting made for a realistic real-time New York held within a larger supernatural universe. The idea of shadow hunters, angels and demons is extremely enticing to me, but I'm a fan girl of Supernatural and Buffy so this in itself isn't quite novel. It's the characters and their relationships that hold the magic. This film had a lot in place and really could have soared had they not tried so hard to make the books ""work"" for the screen. I truly hope the next two books could be made into films but with inspiration from Lord of the Rings instead of Twilight. There's amazing things ahead.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones

Unexpected movie,4,6 April 2014,"I haven't read the book, but at the first time I have no doubt when a friend asked me to watch this movie. the title's good, I love sci-fi and action too, and how the animation works. The first part of the movie was nice, I guess. But then after 20 minutes I realized something's wrong.The story is horrible while the concept is nice. I mean, I thought I overrated this title. City of Bones sounds so good. But I don't like how stupid the story goes. I thought it was a combination among snow white and other fairy tales. And the movie's just.... terrible.

Yea, there might be some problem here. And i think the lighting needs more work. But still, it looks fab. And i can see a lot people complaining about the cast... Yea, i do agree a little for this, but it's not really a big problem. The Soundtracks are great. The movie length are perfect too, not too long nor too short. And... i guess the dialogue are okay. Not really perfect but at least it doesn't sound cheesy. And the plot twist are great- Maybe if i haven't read the book, i will never see that ending coming *okay, ignore this line. I do agree that the books are way better than the movie, but still, they both are awesome. Eight out of ten.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones

Anyway, i recommend you read the books (if you haven't already) it will change your life, especially when you're imagining Jamie Campbell bower in the sexual scenes;* but yeah i definitely think you should watch the mortal instruments; i think the film should be much more well known as it is so good.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones

NO The actor is tall, she does have red hair but it is dead straight and she looks kick ass. Just to summarise, if they didn't blow it by giving away the hhhhhuuuuugggggeeee secret then it wouldn't of been bad, actually it would of been good.

268,sarahattar,So disappointing,4,4 September 2016,"THEY BUTCHERED THE FIRST BOOK! Now listen here, friends, and let me tell you something about The Mortal Instrument series; it's amazing. Mind blowingly amazing. Sky soaring amazing. Life changing amazing. Long story short, it's amazing. But this? This is a disappointment. They chopped and butchered my beloved series and turned it into a pathetic, poorly written, cheestastic, badly edited piece of crap. First off, whats with the guy who plays Magnas Bane? He's a terrible actor. Just downright terrible, the others I can stand but he was just not fit to be Magnas. Or anyone for that matter without a few acting lessons. Secondly, Alec was in the movie for a total of, what, 3 minutes? Third, if you hadn't read the books beforehand you are going to be very very confused at some parts, especially when Valentine steps in so if you truly want to watch this film, I suggest reading up first. Fourth, I don't understand what they did to Jace's character, where's the wit? Wheres that cocky confidence? They drained Jace into a persona that he simply doesn't belong in. This movie was a colossal disappointment. The casting is all wrong, some of the actors are just plain bad at acting and the plot, dear god, the plot MAKES ME MAD.In summary, don't watch it. It doesn't do the series justice at all. It merely taints Casandra Claire's good name. Read the books instead.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
269,ameliantrinity,I loved this movie!!!!,10,2 January 2017,I thought this was a great movie it went along with the book. It did however leave some stuff out but what movie based on a book doesn't. I can overlook that its way better than the TV show. I want to know when are they gonna come out with the NEXT one?!?! The characters were well picked and they did a great job playing their parts. I am so serious about another movie I think the producer and everyone period done a great job. No movie is perfect so what it kept my attention the whole time. So I have to say I was entertained and have watched it several times and and it still catches my attention. I honestly can't stand the TV series. It goes way to far from the books and disappointed me this movie was awesome.,The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
270,silverivy-42326,"Not the best, but definitely Good! (I read the books several times)",8,10 September 2016,"---SPOILERS ---It is 2016 and I just watched the show ""Shadowhunters"". This actually made me watch the movie again and let me tell you something - after that ""masterpiece"" I find the movie (2013) even better than the first time I saw it. OK, maybe some of the characters weren't well introduced. Like Alex. Not as I pictured him, not at all.Or Isabelle - much tougher than the one in the book and the ""femininity""was kinda lacking, but! in the first book she is quite tough and I guess any critics could be fixed in the sequel. Of course they changed some things - it is a movie and it is not The LOTR to have 3 hours for one part. Yes, they may could have explained some things better - the Clave, the Valentine's Uprise, why did Jace believed him so easily that this is his father... etc. but this could have been fixed in the sequel. I repeat myself I know but after watching the ""Shadowhunters"" I am almost desperate to get to the sequel of the 2013 version. I don't know why did they canceled the shooting one week before the start, but that was a mistake. Usually in such cases money are involved. Now let me tell you something - canceling the sequel of 2013 version was a BAD business decision. In times when mediocrity rules the movie world people get picky, and I am sure I am not the only one Cassandra Claire's fan that feels this way ...

It had a great storyline, and I liked how the reality was formed into the story, where Clary couldn't see the world as it was after what had passed between her and Jace. However, I personally do not believe them to be related, for the storyline would be too cliche in my opinion. That is exactly why I adored how Clary just steps onto the bike with Jace and they ride into the distance, without any clearance of what would be in store for them and their relationship in future. I close off with what has been said before, I really enjoyed the movie.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones

We all enjoyed it, I still watch it I never get tired of watching it. I just wish they would have made more movies on it, even though they made a series of it in Shadowhunters it's still not the same. To me the Tv show just doesn't cut it for me because I am in love with the actors of the movie. Lily Collins and Jamie Campbell Bower are clary and jace to me all the way! Kevin Zegers will always be Alec and Robert Sheehan will be Simon, Jemima west Will be Isabelle always and Geo Godfrey will be Magnus which I really loved how he acted as Magnus in the movie.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
274,CactiLes,"Well, I liked it and hope they finish the series but...",8,26 August 2013,"I've read the books and enjoyed the movie, however this movie just seemed awkwardly done, as though the screenwriters weren't discerning regarding what they left in or what they adapted to the screen. The conflict of Clary's and Jace's relationship was sort of briefly tossed out there in a ""make it quick"" sort of way that just ended up being sloppy.And yes, for a couple of the roles, they should have cast younger actors. The main characters are supposed to top out at 18 but come on, it was obvious some of them are pushing 30.I was exceptionally disappointed in Godfrey Gao's performance--very stiff. He looked great, a really good visual choice for Bane but the director really should have told the actor to loosen up in the delivery of his lines. Was this his first acting job----ever? I was really looking forward to seeing how this character was going to be portrayed. I hope he does better if there's a part 2.Robert Sheehan--good job.I also wish there had been more of Jonathan Rhys Meyers. He's barely on screen and when he is he's bonkers. The character, while unhinged, wasn't in a constant frenzy. Again, the director should've looked to the source material in his guidance of these actors.And I'm sorry--when you are able to freeze demons in their place the smart thing to do would be to also kill them all while you can, not tiptoe past them. Who wrote this screenplay?!? OK, in spite of my misgivings, I'd still like to see the rest of the series come to life on screen--and I'd especially like to see the ""prequel"" Infernal Devices also be made into a movie series. There's a lot of potential here!",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones

278,illyria250,Better than Most are Making it Out to Be,7,21 August 2013,"I just got done watching a midnight showing of City of Bones. First off I will say that I am a fan of the series and I will try to make this review as middle ground as possible.I have spent the last few days reading over threads on the discussion board and once the critics reviews came out I read most of those too. Yes I know a lot were negative and abrasive, and sometimes even childish in their mockery of the young adult genre. I went into this movie as open-minded as possible knowing that there were some changes made to the film.Firstly, several reviews, both good and bad, had issues with the pacing. The time line is very condensed at the start of the film so things do seem to be happening in a whirlwind. This is because they condensed a few of the events from the novel into a shorter time span to enable the movie not to drawl on and be way too long. I didn't mind how they chose to change things up a bit and thought they tied things together fairly well. I just could see it being a bit hard to follow for the non fans that don't know what was cut out.I was worried about the romance being played up too much since some reviews were so caught up in the triangle. It was a small part of the bigger story much like in the book. Parts of it did come off a bit cheesy, but overall it did not overpower the movie like I thought it was.I really enjoyed the action sequences. They weren't too short or too long and I felt they were well coordinated. There's definitely enough action for the guys that will be dragged to this with their girlfriends.Some of the changes will probably be unsettling to the fans or upsetting because more of the film was different than I was warned or expected. Many reviewers were adamant that it kept to the book most of the time, but I would say it was a pretty even mix.Like most fans I had a certain idea how some scenes or characters would be and I felt a little let down because characters weren't how I imagined or expected them. Magnus falls flat and lacks the charisma and attitude of his book counterpart. I also felt the way Valentine was played/portrayed did not fall in line with how he was in the book. But everyone who reads has there own interpretations and he wasn't close to he Valentine I had envisioned.Lastly I feel this is a pretty solid movie for the fans and non readers. I wouldn't say it's perfect, few movies have ever come close to achieving that status. There are a lot of good elements going on here and a lot of decent acting from people I least expected it given the time they had to actually develop the characters. If you have any interest in watching the movie don't let all the negativity sway you. Go in with an open mind and make your own judgement. I won't say I loved this movie, but I did really enjoy it and would definitely see it again.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones

I'm surprised to see so many positive user reviews on here , my advice is read the critics reviews far more accurate - no big blockbuster franchise here I for that I think we should all be very thankful , This is one strictly for young kids only !",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones

282,riddikulusoflondon,Professional critics need to get a reality check,8,25 August 2013,"I rarely write reviews but i saw this movie without reading the books beforehand and found it to be a really good movie. Yes, the plot clearly borrowed from other franchises such as Star Wars (""Clary and Jace, I am your father."") and the aforementioned love triangle that screams YA novel drama. OK so my rebuke to the professional critics out there: This film is based on a book series. Let me clue you in to what that entails: 1.) It will not be original because the series would not have gotten published because publishers know what story lines sell in this genre. All stories can be hearkened back to pre-existing ones, even Romeo and Juliet had a predecessor (or 4) 2.) The story on screen is somewhat constrained to the story set forth by the novels. Me, I loved this movie, graphics were fantastic (On Par with Marvel's and the Hobbit franchises), great cast, great characters, and a good start to a series i really want to see more of. So if you are a realistic viewer of movies and are not expecting to see the next Oscar winner, please go see this movie and kick some dirt in the face of nut-bag reviewers like Bruce Ingram of the Chicago Sun-Times, Jeannette Catsoulis of the New York Times, and Scott Bowles of USA Today to name a few.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
283,celinepien,Way to ruin one of my favorite books!,3,31 January 2014,"What an utter disappointment. Like many others I was really excited to go see this movie since the books were absolutely awesome. The movie though.... about halfway through my friend and I looked at each other and whispered 'Did we walk into the wrong movie theater? This nothing like the story in the book' First of all, the characters were all 'meh' versions of the book characters. They took maybe 20% of the original story line and added lots of extra crap. Let me address the elephant in the room: In the books, Clary and Jace discover that they are brother and sister. It's not until the 3rd book that they find out this has been a lie Valentine made up. In the movie Valentine gives it away immediately! (I can't even remember to whom, I must have suppressed that). Why???? That's a MAJOR part of the book series, because as a reader you know it's yucky and all but you still vie for them! Did the producers think it would be too shocking for a YA film to have a 'brother/sister' kiss accidentally?? (Star Wars anyone???) Poor Simon, who is one of my favorites in the books, has changed drastically. In the books it isn't until the 2nd book you find out that he is now a vampire (way to go film makers, the people who had only read the first book will now not want to read the 2nd...)

The actors and actresses did so well portraying the characters. Yes, some of the movie was slightly alter compared to the book BUT that is to be expected. The facts were correct.

286,junkdog8-1,one of the better book to movie translations i have seen,8,15 September 2013,"OK so i am a huge fan of the series have been since i read the first chapter of the first book; and i will say this i am usually a little harsh with the complaints about movies changes to books. i was mildly surprised to find that this movie kept to most of the main points in the book and did a good job of portraying most of the characters.as I said they did a really good job with keeping most of the main parts from the book in the movie, and the SFX were really good, *don't know if this is really a spoiler* the two parts where I felt they really messed things up started at the exact moment they left for Magnus Banes party. at that moment things started going wrong and didn't end until...well until the romantic scene with Jace and Clary! *OK that was a bit of a spoiler* after that I thought they would get back on track, and for a few scenes they did. then everything went wrong again and didn't stop till the end of the movie.as for the characters... lets see; Clary - awesome, Alec - awesome, Jocelyn - awesome, Luke - meh, Simon - pretty good, Hodge - awesome, Isabelle - pretty good, Silent Brothers - ...yah OK, Magnus Bane - now here is a character that I was thoroughly disappointed in after the characters portrayal in the book I was really looking forward to him in the movie and all I got was a haughty guy in his underwear.Now as for Jace; here I am on the fence, I feel that the got Jaces character down perfectly! and the actor was fantastic and doing him; my only problem is one that most fans of the books will understand, he just didn't fit the Jace I had built in my head, but as I said, character was played Excellently. I think that the one I was the most disappointed in was Valentine, not only did they not get his personality, or his general look correct, he just didn't have the bearing needed to fit the character, I am not sure if it was just the wrong actor for him or if they just had him play it wrong but this valentine was not the valentine of the book.the rest of the changes were just things happening in the wrong order or things being in the wrong place, all together though it is a great movie that I felt was worth watching and was very well made.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones

So I watched the trailer(for the first time right before I went to the movies) and god was i disappointed. I didn't like any of the actors. About half an hour into this movie I realized that it was a mess. I usually like it when they change a lot of the story but this was just BS. They removed important details and added some really unnecessary stuff to it. The actor were lousy and the scenography just failed altogether. I'm sorry to say that this was a really YA book to movie and I'm disappointed in the whole thing.

288,rcutts-1,Pleasantly relieved - p.s. Jamie is HOT in this movie!,10,23 August 2013,"I've read all the books and I think they did an excellent job of the movie. Always remember you can't put 500 pages of detailed info into a 2 hour movie and also that not all things transfer well to screen and sometimes need to be changed slightly for flow, action, etc. Jamie Bower Campbell and Lily Collins NAILED the emotions of the twists of their relationship near the end and the action scenes were good too. I can see where people that did not read the books might leave a little frustrated but those of us who did LOVED IT and hope they will continue the series. One more thing, PLEASE STOP TRYING TO COMPARE THIS TO TWILIGHT!!! This story has nothing to do with a vampire love story and it is anything but mushy and simple. This is a well written action filled story that with countless twists that just happens to have a love story (again Jamie was so hot!). I will definitely recommend the movie and if you haven't read the series, get it now so you can catch up!",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
289,denaukhel,Good adaption of the book,10,2 September 2013,"I thought it was really good. The casting was spot on for the most part and aside from flubbing some of the details it followed the book fairly well. Its nice to see that it was done more like harry potter instead of eragon. The only thing I found irritating was Valentine. How hard is it to follow that the guy is blonde not black hair with weird rat tail braids like some sort of Hun. All in all I don't feel like I wasted my money going to see it and will most likely be buying it when it goes to DVD. If you love the books go see it, do yourself a favor. Some pretty good jump scares in it too and very dark imagery. Not good for the younger kids (gory demons etc) but 13 and up should be fine.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
290,MohamedAyman11,no,2,8 March 2014,Just don't come near this movie. the acting (if you can call it that) was so dull only Lena Headey was trying to act but she didn't stay that long. it's like another teen movie if you're into this then watch it and maybe you will also feel the same disappointment as all the books readers felt. and for our luck (not) they are making a second part of this with the same dull actors despite the failure of the movie in the box office which either means they gonna step it up a bit or they will make it worse than it's already is. as so many said if you're into the story read the books and skip the movie(s) not worth the time.please note: my first review of a movie so may not make sense at times,The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones

Aiden Turner (warewolf guy) is just a cheap mans Alcide (True Blood. Other cast members do their part, but there are no real likable characters in this movie apart from the 2 goons Blackwell and Pangborn. Script The script if full of cheesy scenes which try to rush the romance between the two leading characters. There is no chemistry between the lead actors and the scenes feel so forced. The scene where Jace leaves the numerous swords in the umbrella rack has been overdone by so many movies that it is embarrassing to watch. The script gets lost in its self and rushes many of the likable parts which would have made this movie interesting. The scene where she magically manages to freeze the daemons in the last second is infuriating. Why couldn't they kill the daemons while frozen and not just tip toe by? This movie is just a bad rehash which steals ideas from numerous TV shows and movies including True Blood, Vampire Diaries, Buffy etc. It fails to pull it off and I'm very surprised at this films high rating.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
292,bdjmorey,I just don't know....,3,27 August 2013,"I have to say I am a fan of the book series and have read all of them several times (i know :S) . When I went to see the movie I did keep an open mind because I know details have to change sometimes when making books into movie.I was not disappointed with the actors they cast for the movie and the acting itself was actually good. Visually, I think they did amazing. They used very little CGI which is surprising and I give them credit for that. The movie aesthetically is beautiful; at some points almost too beautiful just because when I read the book I pictured it grungier and a little darker in some scenes(but to each his own right).The part that frustrated me the most was that they slaughtered the storyline. Again I completely understand adding a couple of details before they actually happen or tweaking it so it flows better but it didn't. The beginning of the movie was fine, it opened and made sense. As the movie progressed it became mixed and the details all ran together. I think they added characters into scenes that I think shouldn't have been added. SPOILER: The biggest thing that changed was the ending. In the movie Valentine comes to the institute to get the cup from Hodge and Clary then he raises a demon in the institute. Tries to get the mortal cup but doesn't and battles his children who end up trapping him in he a portal. In end the portal blows up and Clary and Jace still have the mortal cup they are ""brother and sister"" and they ride into the sunset while their mother is in a coma. Yeahh........ not really how i remember it.In the book what actually happens is Clary and Jace get the cup, the bring it back to the institute, Hodge traps Clary and knocks out Jace. Then he summons Valentine, give the cup over for his freedom and Valentine takes Jace and cup to an island. After Clary gets free, confronts Hodge wake up with Luke and his pack she leads them on a rescue mission to find Jace. When Valentine and Luke finally meet to battle Jace stops Valentine from killing Luke says he will give the cup back and escapes through a portal by smashing it after he goes through. Soooo Valentine has the cup, Jace and Clary are ""brother and sister"". Which leads to.......book 2/ movie 2. Sooo i don't really know how they are going to connect the two movie unless its showing Clary's mother coming out of the coma. I wish the movie would have been better just because i love the books soo much. I mean I will admit in Harry Potter girl and i never really got worked up about some of the details they changed. I will still probably watch The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones when it comes out just to see if my opinions change and I will probably watch the second movie to see if it gets better. I have my fingers crossed hopefully it works out. Thank you for reading feel free to correct me if there is something off or a detail I got wrong. i would love to heard anyone's opinion.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
293,waggonen,"Story line: Good, Casting: Less than satisfactory",5,15 October 2014,"The storyline was definitely there. It managed to get all the important parts of the book. I enjoyed the change in script to combine and shorten the film from the book.However, the actors didn't match the characters described in the book (i.e Clary should have been a red head not a brunette with a tint of red hair and Valentine should have been a tall blonde not a short brunette.) The characters in the book were all American so I think it was inaccurate to have some of the characters with British accents in the movie. Worth the watch but was a little disappointed in the casting.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones

Overall utter junk compiled from little of every series/movie u can think of from Dracula to Buffy the vampire slayer.Sad attempt at scrounging some cash from fans...Would recommend to watch only to producer's/director's who wanna learn how NOT to make movie.,The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
295,kirene_ao,Just go see it already!!,9,22 August 2013,"If you've read the book, ignore the tiny details, differences between the book and the film. Just focus on the film interpretation. The plot is still the same, just another different way of telling story and it came out pretty good. Action scenes are very entertaining for me and the vampire scene gives out the real evil feeling. I just feel like that they didn't use music up to its potential. If they chose the songs that fit better than the ones we've heard in the movie, it'd have changed and improved the atmosphere in that moment, seriously. My sister doesn't even know that the book exists, but still, she loves the movie and enjoy it very much. We kept talking about it all the way back home. The plot is still there!!! My suggestions >> Don't think too much, Don't (over) expect much and enjoy the movie. It is fun!! (and I'm looking forward to the second film)",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
296,Seth-v-Staden,Utter rubbish,1,14 September 2013,"When this movie started I knew right off the bat that it was going to be bad... Little did I know that it was much worse than that.First off this chick is running.... Like she is in a great rush, knocks over people and still finds the time to stop and see if they are alright. She meets some scrawny guy who knows nothing about her (but later in the movie admits that he knows her birthday from when he was trying to find her)The movie takes place in Brooklyn but everyone who is not human has a British accent? Fair enough I haven't read the books and maybe that is a thing...The nerdy friend gets kidnapped by vampires, apparently gets bitten but the only thing that happens is that his vision returns... No more glasses, and is a day walking vampire who...well isn't a vampire O.oWhile rescuing this little guy from vampires the werewolves show up to save the day. The main girl kills a vampire and looks horrified with herself... Like she can't believe what she has just done but out side after just getting saved by a werewolf she goes all tomb raider, demands a knife and throws it at the hero wolf like it ain't no thang...Then there is some romantic scene where the blond guy and main girl are together in a nursery on her birthday, they make out then go back to her room and get caught out by the nerdy guy. Everyone is angry because this girl is apparently into two guys at once (twilight much?) Then after only a few days of knowing this girl, the blond guy proceeds to tattoo a ruin to heal heart break because... Well he is a 12 year old girl...The main girl is always wet... Like rain, sprinklers, the portal... She is just always wet. In all fairness the cgi scenes were brilliant. Really really awesome! Congrats to the guys who worked on that. Only pro I can think of right now.All In All I wish I had not seen this movie... It literally felt 4 hours long... It would not end.

Boy was I wrong, I have never written a review before but I felt compelled to do so with this movie to save people from wasting their time. If you're anything older than 18 then you'll find the plot, the turns in the story and the acting in particular just plain awful. This is nothing like Twilight or Harry Potter like other reviews suggest. Throughout the whole movie I never engaged with the characters or the story.

It's not that bad. Of course it's different from the books but, they made it believable, more real. I also love the books. Maybe people should give the movie a second chance. Nothing is perfect. Ease up a bit and just enjoy the work these people did. They put their heart into it. Doesn't that mean anything? I am looking forward to City of Ashes and I hope they keep all of the same actors.

All the actors/actresses did a pretty good job, although I must say the guy who played the warlock, Magnus, was absolutely horrendous. I feel like the movie makers chose him just because he's hot. The soundtrack was decent, but it could have been better. I haven't read the book in a long time, so I no longer remember the details of the plot, but the movie doesn't stray too drastically from the books. Valentine's hair is ridiculous though, and he's not as scary a villain as he was in the book.

The soundtrack matched the film perfectly, and made the scenes more intense. I love the way Lily and Jamie portray Clary and Jace, they had amazing chemistry (especially when they kissed),I'm amazed how they did the film without focusing on Clary and Jace's romance they made every scene feel important and when I watched I didn't think that was a good romance film, I thought it was a good film, and Iloved Kevin as Alec, and I like that they didn't over dramatized Alec being gay, Kevin portrayed him as a normal person which I loved.

302,Ktn96,Had high hopes... Shame,5,23 August 2013,"I want to say it straight out, I have read the books. And there were flaws in the book plot line (some overkill plot turns and some ""borrowed"" too). -To better evaluate the movie, I did NOT re-read the books before the movie even with the year gap better reading and watching.- The different subplots and shocks really do drag the book (and now the movie) down and I had hoped the director would cut or edit the subplots. With that, I feel that is the biggest mistake in the movie. Without edits, there was too much crammed into a slightly longer than two hour film. Every single thing was squished into a time frame and was never finish. It left questions. So many different voids that left movie-goers lost in the film. Down to the camera work, it was horrible. Not high school project horrible but close. The shots captured amazingly selected actors in such harsh angles. In so many shots, Clary, THE LEAD, looked ghostly pale and sweaty. And suddenly, the camera would shift to have her perfectly lit and colored. Action-shots, while amazingly preformed, were captured in such chaos with overhead angles switched to individual battles for less than three seconds. Barely a glimpse of the actors are caught before another overview shot cuts onto screen. What a waste. The acting was not too bad. May have been iffy here and there, but the weakest points can only really be seen in Bane's character. The romance, oh how I wish it was downplayed, and that's saying a lot. I am a sucker for romcoms but aghhh. The dramatics of the Clary and Jace scenes but pulled away from the focus. I understand that's how the book went, but come on. It really killed the whole movie and is the second downfall of the film. Not the romance, but lack of focus on genre. The shift between identifying Clary to finding her beloveds (Simon/Luke/her mother) to finding the cup to defeating Valentine to romance was just... EVERYWHERE. It was like it was just splattered onto page and placed into the order as to when the film would introduce a new subplot and when it would jump back to a previous subplot. Blah, everywhere! Transitioning was terrible, lacking, inexistent. Pro: (1)The IDEA (2)The actors (3)The action scenes preformed (but poorly shot) (4)The animation to bring to life the runes, the cup, weapons, demons, etc. Con: (1)The excessive amount of information and the lack of information (2)Transitioning (3)Camera work killed the characters (**4**)The ending (it was not an end but an awkward place holder for a sequel movie that now must come to actually end it)",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones

So i'm not sure how people who have not read the book coped with that or even understood it. For me t was what i pictured the characters were great and the acting was awesome :) However, loads of people are complaining about the movie, you cant please everyone keep that in mind, but it did have flaws such as not explaining itself fully, so many of my friends didn't understand key parts of the story line. They did throw many of the key words in such as ""clave"" and then didn't fully explain them. Overall i hope that the city of ashes will be a bit more like the book and will explain everything more.

When I saw the movie I was very happy with the casting. They all played their characters so well, especially Robert Sheehan as Simon, he made the perfect Simon. Jace and Clary's romance was amazing. I loved everything about the movie. But I was very disappointed that they changed so much from the book. All of it was very VERY different than the book, but they kept the same concept at least. I was confused to as if I loved it or disliked it after watching it because how different it was from the book. But I know now after processing everything that these movies will obviously not be the same as the books, which is okay because it is a fantastic movie and it seems much like what Cassandra Clare would write if she wrote it differently.

308,ilovethebible,Awesome,10,6 December 2013,"One Syfy Movie Everyone Should See Mortal Instruments: City of Bones has hit the big screen! This movie for me has been a long time coming. I have read the book and now I have seen that same book come to life. Now just like most books turned to movies many people think that the book is better, and this movie is no different. I say read the book! But this movie is also really good! The over view of the movie is that Clary Fray has just had her world turned upside down once she can see people others can't and her mother disappears. She learned that demons, werewolves, vampires, warlocks, witches and fairies exist! Clary also learned that these heroes called Shadowhunters who fight all these creatures are real and not only are they real but that she is one of them! The characters are very close to what I had pictured in my head. Lilly Collins, who plays Clary, is very good and I feel she shows the essence of Clary very well. Jamie Campbell Bower, who plays Jace the love interest of Clary, keeps all the girls looking with his good looks and closed off attitude. He is also very attractive just like Jace in the book. The other actors and actress are very ""dead on"" with their characters. These characters (actors) helps bring the book to life. The writers and casters of the movie were very good at doing their jobs. The connections that are in the book are also in the movie. The friendships, the dislikes and even the love keep movie goers interested and rooting for the good guys to win! The action in the movie is captivating and also keeps you interested the whole time. With fighting demons, partying with warlocks, running from vampires, thrashing with werewolves and learning about all the new surroundings. The action keeps you jumping and waiting for the next step; never a dull moment in the world of Shadowhunters. The movie also makes you question if what you are looking at is the real thing or is it just an (insert word from book here). In the movie they do miss a few parts that were in the book. For example they stay at the institute and do not go to the new location when they have to fight Valentine, who is the villain in the book, but the writers did do a good job of making the movie still have the fight scene. For the fight scene they kept it in the institute, but the fear and anger where still very apparent. The love story in the movie is there and with every love story there is some ups and some downs. But you want the young starting love to happen. And when a hard hitting ""fact"" comes into play, you are hoping it not to be true. When the characters find out about that they may be related, I felt like I was right there reading and feeling it all over again. I am pretty sure I even said 'no' to the movie screen. There are more books to the Mortal Instruments series and all I have to say is that if they are going to continue making these books into movies I will be in the theater watching every single one! This just might be the next Harry Potter, because the books and movies put you into another world that you didn't know that was there. I am glad to be a part of the making of good movies. Even through many people may compare this movie to Twilight, and this movie is nothing like Twilight, it is better. They have the same moments about love, loss and fear. But I feel that these books are better written and the movie has better actors and better story line.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
309,pablo_rojinegro9,What a mess.,5,31 August 2013,"First of all, I'd like to say that I'm not unfamiliar to this saga. Personally, I've never read the books, but I've read good things about them, and when I heard they were making a cinematic adaptation, it called my attention and hyped me (what a mistake). I stepped into this movie with expectations, mainly due to the fact that several fans have told me that his was good, really good. What is this? At first, the plot seemed interesting, as well as all the mythology behind it. It was interesting, until the unnecessary abuse of teen romance came. Long stares, cliché settings, and young love is something that the public has seen somewhere else, and that turned what should be intense scenes, into awkward moments where half the audience was laughing; it created involuntary humour. The movie failed to deliver and never connected with me, and the script was all over the place, with repetitive ideas and out of place plot twists. If they're going to attempt to turn this into the next big saga, they need to do a lot better, since this is clearly not the best example of a good movie adaptation; it's a mix of things we've seen before, with a couple of fresh notes, but that end up being eclipsed by unnecessary scenes and situations. Personally, I don't recommend this movie, avoid of necessary.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones

For the book based fans the movie is exactly like the book the setting and everything. The only complaint i have is Jace was scrawny looking (no disrespect to Jamie). For people that are new to the series it is a great start it have a love triangle like twilight, Clary and Jace are Edward and Bella and Simon is Jacob. If you are still iffy about watching the movie watch the actors interviews on youtube it is hilarious.

312,snagel2508,I enjoyed it!,8,9 September 2013,"My husband and I saw it last weekend (I had read the book and he hadn't) and we BOTH really enjoyed the film.It did start off a bit slow and i was a little concerned, but as soon as it picked up speed it was a fun ride. The action/fighting scenes and CGI effects were excellent. They did change a lot from the book, however as a fan of the books this did not bother me too much.The only areas for improvement in my opinion would be perhaps the way the love story was executed. Several lines from the books are used, however the way they were delivered in the film just weren't quite right (they did come out quite cheesy). I feel like they tried to create the 'love at first sight' between Jace & Clary, however in the books it is very much a love/hate relationship in the beginning which was very amusing to read. This would have been good to see in the film, especially because i think Jamie Campbell-Bower pulled off Jace's sarcastic sense of humour really well.I also really didn't like the song choice for a romantic scene (a Demi Lovato song). I feel a better soundtrack would have helped a lot too.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
313,iriadore,Good actors still couldn't save it....,3,8 March 2014,"I respect the acting abilities of Jonathan Rhys Meyers(Dracula), Lena Heady(Game of Thrones), and Jamie Campbell Bower and feel like they did play their roles very well in this film, but it still wasn't enough to make this an enjoyable experience. The effects in this movie were even well done. However,the mythology of the story seemed childish (claiming to have ""shadowhunter"" blood to me felt like saying she had garbage collector blood. Why not say her mother comes from a line that drank the blood of demons/angels and thus became hunters instead? Skills are taught, not genetically passed down after all). Also the slow, dull progression made me check frequently to see how many minutes were left when watching this on DVD. The fight scenes were also very silly, especially the vampire rumble scene in the room that looked like it was set up to host a Moose Lodge Meeting. Lily Collins portrayed a whiny and weak character that seemed content to question and use everyone in her world, especially her nerdy best friend. She throughout the movie had little to offer beyond her ability to somehow spontaneously write a rune on herself that freezes Silent Hill looking cinder dog demons in their tracks....temporarily. Then she continues on leaving her werewolf allies to face them and die when the monsters can move again. Why not errr...keep using the rune while shadowhunters take them apart?? The werewolf jokes were moronic and excessive i.e ""Do you want to hang your head out of the window??"" to a bloke in man form while entering a car. The worst was her throwing a dagger at this same werewolf in wolf form when he was openly slaying vampires so that she and her friends could escape. Then later he says ""Nice shot..."" which if it had been he would have been dead I would imagine and not running around in the alter Silent Hill ripoff world. Also what is up with that lion's head knocker that spins up to reveal an enormous peephole big enough to reveal someone's whole head in it?? They show this scene over and over like it is impressive when all I can think is that a villain could reach in and unlock the door or some other anticlimactic action.I will admit I have not read the books, but after seeing this movie I am afraid to.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones

The plot- If I thought in the beginning of the movie that they've messed with the plot, I was left gaping-mouthed by the end of it.2.

315,lgore617,Critics have been too harsh.,10,22 August 2013,"The main thing that bugs me about all of the reviews that this movie has been given, is the fact that the people writing it aren't trying to see the movie from the perspective of the audience that this movie is aimed at, which happens to be teenagers. The book was aimed at teenagers and happened to be a NY times best seller and the movie is very true to the book even down to little details, so if you did happen to fall in love with the characters like I did you won't be disappointed seeing them come to life right in front of you. I personally loved the movie, and loved the fact that it frequently used the best lines from the book like, ""Jesus"", ""No it's just me."" - Simon. It was funny and witty and Jamie Campbell Bower who plays Jace did such an incredible job. He is Jace, everything that he did or said in the film was just perfection. Lily Collins who plays Clary, was incredible as well and the chemistry between them was amazing, they were the perfect on screen couple. Simon was just I can't even. He is just perfect, exactly what I pictured him to be. The special effects were so amazing that I couldn't tell what wasn't real. Everyone has their own taste in movies I know, but you need to give it a try. If you don't try to look for all of it's flaws and just enjoy the film for the perfection that it is, you may enjoy your self. I did, I had an amazing time watching this with my friends, it was a great day out and the best way to cheer a friend up when they were having a bad day. I know it may not be for everyone, but you have to give it a chance before you even think about judging it. Just watch the movie and have fun, I ask of you for just that. Just think with all the criticism that this movie has taken, imagine what they will take into account for the next movie and how amazing that will be. By you not seeing the good you might miss out on what could be a massive franchise. I beg of you give it a chance, and think about how good the next movie will be.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
316,jezebel484,Great movie,10,28 November 2018,I really enjoyed watching this movie. I loved the story and i'm really disappointed that after so many years they didn't continued. The actors were nice too.,The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
317,danicas,Horrible,1,22 August 2013,"Words can't describe how disappointing this film was . Cassandra Clare effed this up . it had the potential of being something good.. lets start with the characters Alec (Kevin Zegers) Is your character going thru a language dilemma ? Are you British , or American..& No one other than the fans of the books got the gay vibe off him, so it was balls confusing to everyone else when Clary outed him . 0/10Isabelle (Jemima West)Pretty enough for the character, but why change her entire personality from the book? & not to mention her height.. 4/10Simon(Robert Sheehan) Perfect Simon , from top to bottom But Cassandra Clare,why would you allow an entire story arc change for this character. again other than the fans , no one had a clue why he didn't need his glasses anymore.. and why all of a sudden he is a day walker... where was the rat , where was the birth of a vampire , where was his Jewish jokes!!! this character was the seconded most disappointing portal. 5/10 Jace (Jamie Campbell Bower)what the eff ... this , this is not jace. Jamie looks like he is a drug addict , scrawny , unflattering , and not to mention the lack of chemistry between jace and Clary on film. Disgusting performance.. #1 most disappointing thing about this entire film was him . 0/10Clary (Lily Collins) sigh , obviously this was a money grab of a casting choice.0/10 Valentine (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) If you make such a fuss in the book about his white hair ....WHY DOESN'T HE HAVE WHITE HAAAAAIR!!! arg. JRM , was a terrible Valentine . He made that character into a stubborn child , and not the sly evil devil valentine should've been . And really hodge makes up the idea for jace to be your son REALLY ?!?!?!? bull just bull ! 0/10Jocelyn (Lena Headey) She wasn't that bad actually , stayed true to character , but i blame the script and how is was made that made her character look like a fool. & Oh , and she has a bad case of the duck lips.. 6/10Now to talk about the movie itself ( i'll keep it short)Too fast , did not stay true to the book of characters , horrible cinematography, the cheesiest soundtrack, and way too jumpy for fans and newbies alike . Sorry for the harsh review , in fact its my first and most likely my last.But after watching this movie i was heartbroken and i needed to share my frustration with anyone willing to read this, My grammar & spelling are very poor i realize this , so take it as it is and if you go and see this movie go in knowing its not what your wanting to see. -Dancia",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
318,biscuit-gravy207,Everyone making a fuss,10,22 August 2013,"When you read a book you have a perfect picture of what the characters look like and how every place is painted in a beautiful world a reader makes inside their minds. And to be honest my world that i created in my head had some differences but many similarities. yes, there was many changes and like most i walked in with a open mind and expected anything that awaited me.I walked out with a huge smile and a very empty bucket of popcorn, some people are getting angry about how major things have been changed even though the changes fit well with the story they also added a little extra flavor to the already amazing story.I believe this movie is much better than i had expected to ever come out of a book its a great reproduction of a novel unlike the other movie that are base from books.The cast is practically perfect and yes they have some difference i but seriously fell in love with every single one of them like i did when i read the book. this movie made me happy that i had the opportunity to see it and read a novel that can inspire people to become better and to believe in thing far greater than we can truly believe.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones

Especially when they said Bethoven was a shadow hunter and they showed his painting in which his arms were in runes..or the thing with the portals... I just couldn't stop laughing - it was that bad.Also in some moments it was really corny - butterflies and fireflies and also rain coming out of nowhere when the main characters first kissed..I think that the directors also failed to interpret Jace's humor and he turned out not funny at all.And the soundtrack - it was more appropriate for some soap opera.Also I think that revealing something as big as Clary and Jace are not brother and sister in the first movie ,whereas in the books it was discovered in the third one or so, is just awful..I have to admit that one of the few things I liked was the cast , which made the movie all the more disappointing because i expected something great..",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
320,gustavel,Teenage girl movie,4,21 January 2014,"Damn why did I watch it. A movie that is clearly based on a book written by a lady with unrealistic ideas(fantasies) about teenage interaction and relationships aimed at angsty teen girls; and boys who may still be playing in Narnia. Mmmm OK 10 line minimum. The characters are stereotypical, but people like placing things in boxes in their minds, and the plot predictable. Entertaining in concept but the lack of adult supervision has left this movie in shallow water paddling for an early beaching.But maybe I'm the dumbass for watching it... :\Made be laugh (at it), had a few good concepts in it and vampires that don't sparkle... amazing!",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
321,clairelovesanimals,A little frustrated.,4,22 August 2013,"Okay first of all, i'm a little disappointed as to Simon not being turned into a rat. It was one of the funniest parts of the book! I get that the whole book would have been too long but I believe that that part of the book was worth the extra few minutes, he would have turned back into Simon after the fight if there wasn't enough time to show him in the institute. Second of all, Valentine is suppose to have white hair (I don't really care about this detail it's more about how he was played) He is suppose to be a sophisticated, well spoken, SMART villain. You are suppose to think ""How is HE the villain?!?"" He's suppose to be really charming but have a darkness to him. Instead he looks like a biker who wondered on the set and was told ""Oh you're the villain.""Clary is NOT suppose to be drawing runes until the next installment, but I guess i see why it was necessary for her to be able to draw runes in that scene. But it was just another confusing aspect to this movie.Jace is suppose to be a really rude character. He's NOT suppose to be love struck over Clary every ten seconds. It's not suppose to be really obvious, yeah you get a few little indications here and there, but it's not the main focus in his mind. There was a lot more focus on Clary and Jace than Alec and Jace. They definitely should have explained that a lot more. Even though I had read the book, even I said ""Wait, what?"" when Clary said that Alec loved Jace because we didn't have any indication before that other than the little tiny mumble Alec said to Clary which was ""Stay away from Jace."" There were two more indications after that which was Alec talking to Jace and also Alec pushing Clary against a wall and threatening to kill her if she doesn't leave. Maybe that scene with Isabelle should have happened later on in the movie. We didn't have any indication as to Luke being the leader of the pack, it was just a call to other werewolves who were working in a store to be honest. Luke was really confusing in the movie if you didn't read the books, he's a father figure to Clary. He's basically like her step-dad. ALSO! What was with Hodge telling Valentine to tell Clary and Jace they were related?! That was a waste of time, and it gets you wondering ""Are they related? Are they not?"" It's suppose to make you gasp and say ""Oh no! They are related!"" They should have just shown Valentine telling Jace and Clary, Hodge was completely unnecessary in that part of the film.The end scene was a bit weird and cliché. Them riding off in a motorcycle that 1. Was not mentioned as to why he had one. Or 2. How he got it (Which was on the roof of Dumort Hotel which would have been a nice bit to add into the movie.) I guess somethings need to be cut out of the book but I think these things were a bit necessary in order for people to love the movie as much as the book.The only things I loved about this film were the creatures, (They were really well done and creepy!) Jocelyn, (she was really well cast and well acted and very true to the books) and the sets. (They were just as I had imagined if not, better!) All in all, a good film. This is just what annoyed me as I have spent the time to read the books and I love all the characters and the sets. For people who haven't read the books. It's not too confusing, although some parts in the movie you go ""What just happened?"" I recommend seeing this with someone who has read the books to explain those bits. Please go see this movie if you have read the book, it was extremely exciting to see what and who I have imagined on a massive screen. If you haven't, go see with someone who has read the books if you want to really understand the series without reading the books.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
322,filmbuff-548-202268,Ave atque vale City of Ashes,9,15 September 2013,"There was so much to like about this film. With skill and economy the relationships between the main characters were established immediately. Congratulations on that score to the lone screenwriter. It's a daunting task to take on a franchise as beloved as The Immortal Instruments and she did a great job. Yes it helps tremendously if you're already a fan of the books but that's true of so many novel-to-screen stories. I loved the opening shot of Clary's building with Dorothea peering out the window and all those slow luscious close-ups inside Clary's apartment--such a contrast to the later scene where she's single-handedly battling the demon. And that demon was actually scary, folks, like the first time I saw the alien pop out of that guy's chest in, well, Alien, of course.The fight between Valentine and Jace was the best hand to hand combat scene I've seen in a long time--close-up, full out, brutal and intense--and so welcome after a summer of CGI battles. All this action combined with a touching teen love triangle seems like a formula for success to me. I was already looking forward to the sequel and now I read that it has been put on ""hold"". That's a pity.Ave atque vale City of Ashes, Gillian & Risa",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
323,carolanngollop,Has Potential,7,11 September 2013,"Firstly, let me say that i'm a 37 y/o mother of 2, fan of fantasy, who has read all TMI books and would give them 8 out of 10. I decided to go see the movie mainly because it had in 3 of my favorite actors - Jaime Campbell Bower, Lenna Headey and Jonathan Rhys Mayers.I was very skeptical as to how they would adequately develop all of the story's characters, as well as take the viewer comfortably through the journey set out in the book. And i will say that overall, i was disappointed. I left the movie feeling exactly as i did when i left Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. With this in mind, the subsequent HP movies were vast improvements on the first. Therefore, i do believe that with some major tweaks and twerks, City of Ashes could be a huge success!PROS - Amazing cast with limitless potential. With the exception of Godfrey Gao, i was happy with how all of the characters were portrayed. I always viewed Magnus to be quite eccentric, and GG did that NO justice. He was too bland and boring. Lily Collins, Jonathan Rhyes Mayers, Jamie Campbell Bower, Robert Sheehan, Kevin Zegars, Aiden Turner, Lenna Headey and Jemima West were great. However, a weak script didn't let them reach their full potential! - Great special effects. - Great potential storyline for future movies in the franchise. - Huge fan base of the books, that could be converted to fans of the movie franchise.CONS - Very weak script for COB not giving the actors a chance to really excel, show emotion and make a real PUNCH. Too much for too short a time, resulting in no aspect of the movie being given adequate time to develop. Viewers were forced to jump from scene to scene, having barely understood the plot lines. Yes, there was a lot that had to be covered in 2 hours, but it was just too un-linked and haphazard. There was no opportunity for viewers to become vested in the movie. - GG as Magnus. I don't think he has the ability to do the character justice. If they decide to make City of Ashes, but only if they can convince me that they've made specific changes and improvements.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
324,diozxdezire,Very Good Movie... Thats MOVIE not BOOK.,9,2 September 2013,"I, personally, have never read the books in this series. I think the movie was extremely enjoyable. The problem is.. it is definitely suffering from the book to movie syndrome with regard to the viewers. I am also a huge fan of Game Of Thrones (one of the best shows of all times). The books are much better than the show but the show is phenomenal. People... this is an adaptation. Things need to be sacrificed. All non book-readers seeing this movie that I know were pleasantly surprised. The action was great, the fantasy/mystery elements were very enjoyable. As an opening movie to the franchise I was very happy and would definitely go see the sequel. Of course there were plot holes... It is extremely rare to see a movie without them. Harry Potter was a massive success and left out numerous elements (and even epic battles) but still made money. This series can do the same. Just go into it and watch it as a separate entity from the books and you will not be disappointed. The only way you will not be happy is if you sit there and nitpick saying ""Hey wait this is supposed to happen on a Wednesday not a Friday"" or ""Hey wait his hair was whiter in the books! "". Seriously? Luckily I didn't have the burden of those details in my head so the movie was definitely worth it to see for me. This was better than Twilight, even better than the Harry Potter's first movie. The potential is there if you can watch it with an open mind. To the book readers... an on screen depiction can often change the time lines significantly... give the series a chance before assuming certain points have been completely eliminated. Books are much more elaborate and intricate... movies are all about the visuals. It would take days to read the book out loud verbatim.. a movie has 2 hours to do this. The book series wiki summarized the book in about 5 paragraphs. This movie did just fine for me.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones

Nice computer effects help as well,The issue is that while Lily Collins and Jamie Campbell Bower are trying to deliver their best, Jonathan Rhys Meyers played as if he mixed up the scripts and that one was coming from Tudors – with his performance being a replica of Henry VIII in TudorsIn general, this is not a movie for those looking for answers to their philosophical (or alike) questions, but for a bunch of friends who don't have any other option of killing their spare time (may be read a book next time?)...",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones

I read all the books and had a hard time putting them down. I was so excited when I heard they were making this movie, but usually the books are better. I was praying that this production crew would do the books justice, like the ones on Twilight... So I dragged my husband on our anniversary! The movie was great... Action packed, the filming was done great and the love story was not cheesy (Like my husband said of Twilight...actually ""corny"" was the right word). Anyways, I personally thought that they stuck to the story line the BEST they could for a 2 hour & 10 min movie. If they touched base on everything, it would be a 4 hour movie. With that said, the movie is worth seeing, even if you haven't read the books... you will NOT be lost. My husband only had 1 question through out the movie and the rest he was able to follow. Jamie Campbell-Bower did AMAZING as Jace. So I hope all those people who criticized him, feel stupid.

327,vnguy037,Forget the Critics-LOVED this movie,10,24 August 2013,"First off all, I wouldn't listen to anyone who says that this movie is a rip off of 1. Twilight 2. The Hunger Games 3. Harry Potter. It feels as if EVERY BOOK and EVERY MOVIE, has to fall into those three category and it just disheartening and annoying! The Mortal Instruments series by Cassandra Clare is SO GOOD, that it deserves its own category, it does not and will not ever fall below any of those three books listed above. So any critic who says that obviously has very limited knowledge on YA books, and only uses those three books as comparisons. I know everyone has their own personal opinion and I respect that, but people who judge base on pure ignorance seriously tick me off-I feel like some of these critics go into the movie already hating it which is unfair. Anyone who has read the three series listed above and the TMI series knows just because TMI has vampires, werewolves, and warlocks does not mean that it is ""ripping off"" any of those books. In my opinion, the TMI series is superior to the rest.Now with the movie, I thought it was great! The acting was superb, and I love Jamie Bower as Jace-he really captured a darker side of Jace than was portrayed in the book but he is still an amazing actor nonetheless. Loved how they include DIRECT QUOTES from the book-it was nice as a fan of the books to see and notice that, and it was pretty thoughtful of the writers to give us that. The CGI was amazing-everything looked real, and the fighting and action scenes were killer.I can't wait to City of Ashes! Cassandra Clare is unbelievably talented, and it is such an honor to have her books be brought to life on the big screen. If you're a fan of the TMI series, know that the movie isn't a carbon copy of the book but it doesn't mean that it isn't amazing. Just keep that in mind. Those who haven't read the books, don't judge base on the critics' reviews and go out to see it to make your own judgment.

328,natashagent,Thoroughly Disappointed,1,13 November 2013,"I remember when I first read this book series, I fell in love with this world Cassandra Clare created. I contemplated not seeing this movie at first. I didn't want my vision of this world that I came up with from reading the book to be shattered. I was upset to the maximum degree once I saw it. I can understand when movies have some changes in plot but when almost every scene is blatantly different... It really annoyed me. I'm almost at a loss for words at how disappointing this turned out, the only character that did not turn out as bad as the rest was Simon. The actor who portrayed him didn't do as bad as the others. When the vampire change scene came on I was excited, hoping they at least kept that the same. I was wrong. I was just angry the entire scene, what had possessed them to hang him from chains as they did!? Why did Isabelle and Alec go with Clary and Jace to the hotel!? Where was Simon turning into a rat!? For me this was a huge part of the story that impacted so much in future events. For the directors to change this baffled me, I'm confused with how they will be able to play out future events in this series. That scene was only one of the many mistakes made in the making of this film. I could go on and on with everything that went wrong in this movie but I won't bore anyone.

They should give this movie a chance, STOP COMPARING IT. I was satisfied with the adaptation, as a fan of the books I had my hopes a little up. I liked it very much and I am looking forward for a sequel, though I am hoping they improve one thing or more. I was a little disappointed by some of the cast performances, specially Magnus Bane. I enjoyed the fact that they used lines exactly as read on the book, some changes made a little mad, but you can't have everything in a book-to-movie version. Even so, they stuck to the book a great deal, that was nice. So, again, I really liked this movie, and I really hope they continue the series, and if they do, I hope they make the next movies better.

330,TCLAustin,Decent *if* you can ignore how derivative it is.,5,10 October 2013,"Harry Potter, Underworld, Twilight, Star Wars - This script overtly, and at times painfully borrows heavily from all of them. Suitable for low to mid teens, the older folks will suffer tedium from knowing what's coming every step of the way.Featuring violence throughout, blood and guts are kept to a minimum via the usual mechanics - you can tell the vampire is being terribly savaged by the werewolf from the noises going on, fortunately the werewolf hit the vampire at 40 miles an hour knocking him into a corner and you can't actually see any of it. Similarly, the shadowhunters favor edged weapons which somehow don't cause much blood to spray, nor does the camera linger on the wounds. The action is kept fast and choreographed well enough. With a better, more original script this really could have been a standout. Dialogue was a middle of the road effort, but effects, acting, sets, cinematography, etc etc would have gotten this movie a solid 7/10 from me if the plot didn't keep going down such incredibly well worn paths. As it is, 5/10. At way too many points in this I found myself shaking my head at the reuse of plot twists that have already left the dead horse nothing but a scrap of hair in a hole in the ground.

My husband, who has never read the books and is a BIG, at-the-theaters-once-a-week fan, enjoyed the movie more than he expected he would. This is not like Twilight, Clary is Bad-Ass compared to Bella. 2 hours will never accurately piece together a 300 page book- but remember, they're two different types of media.

I am starting to regret this.The basic story is phenomenal, the effects of the movie are great, I like the actors. My biggest complain about the actors is that the most competent one spends most of the movie in a coma, and the others could really have benefited from exploring a wider emotional range when filming this movie. The acting is a bit flat, which I don't get because I have like these actors in other movies.The biggest problems for me were the screen writing. The lines burped out by the actors all came across very ""gossip girl meets twilight"". It wasn't too funny, it wasn't too believable and it was plain out awkward statements at times.

335,ronin3338,Made for young teens,4,11 January 2014,"The plot is simple, predictable, and at times a bit cliché. It is easy to see where this movie borrows elements from other movies and even role-playing games. Character development gets tangled up in haphazard storytelling. At times the blatant exposition drags the pacing to a crawl and at other times it is rushed along with barely any time to absorb what is going on. In the midst of all this are a variety of interesting young characters, most of whom we hardly know. Even the three main characters could stand a bit more depth to make us care about their situation. The acting is fine, but certainly nothing noteworthy. The dialog is mostly smartly written and current, but that makes the occasional gaffe really stand out. Visually this looks more like a television production than a theatrical release, and many of the demonic effects show a lack of either talent or budget. Overall, I would rather re-watch an episode of Buffy or Angel, or even Teen Wolf than this again, but it's not awful. If you like clichéd teen romance with a bit of supernatural/fairy tale parental drama, you might really enjoy this, but for most folks who like supernatural adventure movies there are a lot of better options available.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones

As a fan of the books, I came into this knowing they were going to change things, and being okay with it. I was very happy with the small changes, and rearrangements. I loved this movie. It has to be one of my favorite book to movies. It's different, but the changes all fit well with were the movie went, and flowed. Despite what critics have said, I think this is nothing at all like Twilight or Harry Potter. It's nothing we ever have seen before, being a fan of a lot of YA novels and movies, (and have repeatedly read and watched them) so I know whats what. This movie/book is not at all like Twilight, especially. For one the female lead can actually kick ass, and stand up for herself. The acting was much, much, better than I expected. Robert Sheehan was fantastic as Simon, Lilly Collins a great lead, truly pulling off Clary, and Jamie Campbell Bower was everything I ever imagined for Jace. Jonathan Rhys Meyers was absolutely creepy, as the villain, Valentine, Kevin Zegers played Alec perfect, and new comer Jemina West was the best Isabelle I could picture. WHO WILL LIKE THIS MOVIE: I was with my mom, who has not read the books at all, and she loved it. She's a fan of fantasy like I am, so she was able to keep up with everything, and understand. Unlike some critics who stated they couldn't keep up with all the new terms. So I recommend this movie to ANYONE who likes fantasy films, that have action, good acting, love, and a little bit of scary. Who SHOULDN'T watch this movie: People who expect this to be Twilight, and just another teen show. People who can't accept changes to the book at all. COMPLETELY WORTH SEEING IN THEATER!

337,hot-potatoe42,The Worst Fantasy Movie I Have Ever Seen,1,9 October 2013,"I would be hard pressed to enumerate all the flaws this movie has from my one viewing. But since I almost walked out of the theater I couldn't possibly bring myself to watch it again for the sake of this review.Let's start with the simple fact that it's extremely derivative of most tween fantasy book adaptation that has come out in recent years. This could be attributed to the fact that the books these movie are based on are actually awfully written. At least The Hunger Games delivered a better movie than the book was. This has been mentioned by many critics, but I just could believe from how many movie the director ""borrowed"" stylistic, thematic and mood elements. So we have the awkward and overly dramatic love triangle that seems to be a staple of tween fantasy storytelling since the Twilight series (see I Am Number 4, The Host, The Hunger Games, even Harry Potter at times). It is terribly predictable. ""Luke, I am your father."" Does that sound familiar. You can see every dramatic twist from a mile away. The story progresses in such a disjointed manner that the storyline has actually lost all cohesion when we reach the end of the film. Plot elements are dropped without even demanding a sequel. I have seen better acting in Bela Lugosi movies and more realism in most animated movies. I found no redeeming qualities to the movie. Not even the good looks of the protagonists could make me look past the cringe-worthy cheesiness. And finally, I'm sick of seeing female protagonist depicted as hyper-emotional, male-reliant little dolls. Where are the Ripley's, the Selene's. Why do female protagonists have to be women who break down at the most importune moments and need rescuing from men. A strong female character was without a doubt the saving grace for The Hunger Games. A quality so many recent movies have denied their leading ladies. Judging from the Hollywood export one would almost have to believe that feminism is dead. So if you have money burning a hole in your pocket, exchange it for quarters, go to a fountain, throw it in and pray for a better movie. Just don't watch this one. The title is aptly named. This movie is where imagination came to die.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
338,frswlaliwth,This can't be true:(,3,31 August 2013,"I went to see this movie the other day and since I'm a big fan of the books I was all so excited to actually be able to see my fantasy on the big screen. But as the movie started playing everything went down the hill. They have changed basic dates which play a big part in the whole story since certain events happen at specific time and they actually change the whole story. With the exception of the funny poetry scene with Erik everything else was.. how can I put it politely? Bad. I couldn't even understand the feelings the characters were supposed to be feeling before they were spoken out loud. In the books there is a certain motive, communication-battle- communication-adventure, so you're able to understand what's going on. But in the movie you just don't get it. The movie itself is a spoiler, it gives way too much information which is supposed to stay hidden because it makes the upcoming story more interesting and breathtaking. In conclusion, I really think that the books had good potential for becoming a movie without changing everything, which unfortunately happened.(Read the books, they are amazing. and skip the movie)Dear Hollywood, make a remake.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
339,LeeAnneK,"This movie is based of the series 'The Mortal Instruments' , the first book 'City of Bones'",3,22 March 2014,"SPOILER ALERT-DO NOT READ UNLESS YOU HAVE SEEN THE MOVIE AND/OR BOOKThis movie is based of the series 'The Mortal Instruments' and is about a girl,Clary, who is dragged into the shadow hunter world. A group of people who devote their lives to purifying this world and slaying demons. Everything she knew about the world is wrong, anything she thought was fake or not real, is true. Including werewolves, vampires, warlocks, and fairies, known as downworlders. including anything she knew about herself. Her mother is gone, stolen by her supposed father who she thought to be dead. Valentine is planning to overrun the Conclave and its up to Clary and her new found friend Jace, one of the best shadow hunter fighters there is, to stop him.I am currently reading 'The Mortal Instruments' series. I have read the first and second book so far (City of Bones, City of Ashes), and am currently working on the third (City of Glass) at present. This movie is supposed to represent the first of this incredible series, and it does an absolutely terrible job. I don't even know where to begin in the mistakes this movie makes. Yes, I am aware that a movie will have a hard time squeezing an entire move into such a small time frame. But you know what doesn't help? When part of the SECOND book is in the FIRST movie. Instead of ruining the second book for me, (which by the way, at the time of watching, I was still reading...) you could have been focusing on making the details, and even the bigger points more by the book.For example, in the very beginning. They OPENED the movie, and I automatically knew that I would hate it. Why? Because in the book, you open to that party she went to with Simon. She see's Jace, Isabelle, and Alec kill that boy (demon) and goes home confused and upset. Then her mom and her have a fight, which she escapes from by going to the poetic reading with Simon. At which she ignores several phone calls from her mom, because she is still mad. Then she sees Jace and goes out to question him and see what he wants. He explains what he thinks she is, and then her mom calls her again, and leaves a message telling her to not go home with some noises in the background.(which they do kind of hint on in the movie, but so far that's one of the only things they did right)And so Clary runs home, finds her apartment trashed. And fights, and kills that huge demon herself (Which was a little important, because its one of the reasons she is allowed to stay in the institute later)But she does get hurt and passes out from the poison. Then Jace follows her and finds her, and marks a healing rune on her with his stele (which is also important because its the other reason she is allowed to stay in the institute, runes can kill mundanes,humans, but the rune worked on her so it proved she was a shadow hunter) and carries her back to the institute. And so on, anyway those of you who saw the movie know that that is not what happened in the movie, not even close. Simon was not supposed to meet Jace until later. These are just a few of the things this movie did wrong, there are an absolute ton more. I can't possibly describe them all in one review. Also a lot of the characters look absolutely nothing as described in the book, especially Jace. Even if I had not read the books, I would have hated this movie. It has little to no character development at all. To be honest, any of these characters could have died and I just really wouldn't care. Also, It moves way too fast, You could have risked the movie being a little longer because the way they tried cramming everything in just made it worse. Not putting in anything from the second book in may have helped a ton. The point of this movie was supposed to put this book into a movie, well you failed. Congratulations.Hands down, this movie sucks. The author is probably ashamed, just as the majority of the book fans are probably just as upset. I cant believe you did this to a great book.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
340,aagnek,please please remake this film!,3,22 August 2013,"Yes, I read the books before seeing the movie. I expected the movie to deviate from the book and twist the plot somewhat. This, however, was just a mishmash of major events from the book slammed together without allowing the moviegoer to see any kind of story line. The lines seemed randomly thrown together. Most of the discussions were so out of place that it was like watching two people facing each other but having separate conversations. The overbearing music mixed with the missing story line made it feel like I was watching a trailer for the movie rather than the actual thing. The kissing scene was so over the top that I felt like i was in fern gully. I felt it was poorly made, poorly directed and very poorly written. It gets 3 stars only because the creatures looked cool. I couldn't tell if the acting was as terrible as it felt or if it was just the crappy script the poor actors were handed.There could have been so much more done with the movie. I'm really disappointed in the lack of imagination.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones

It's the typical love triangle, girl doesn't know which guy she loves...come on...its just too 'twilight'. I really wanted to slap Clary across the face. I mean like, just make up your damn mind who you want to love. And I don't get why Clary has to dress up provocatively just to meet Bane, isn't this movie supposed to appeal to teenage girls? There is no need for Clary to dress up like a prostitute unless they are trying to turn the teenage girls into lesbians. Despite her strengths and abilities, Clary appears to be a very weak character. Seriously, I was so glad when the movie ended. It was just too cliché and you can guess 60% of the movie without even reading the books.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
342,fangirlnostalgia,"With her mother being kidnapped by the most powerful Shadowhunter, Clary Fray would do anything to get her mom back.",10,22 August 2013,"The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones is a book to movie adaptation that many fans had anticipated. And it's finally here! The best words that would suffice to describe this movie are: incredible, action-packed, romantic, thrilling, unpredictable, amazing, and one of a kind.The fans are so lucky to have such an amazing cast. Jamie Campbell Bower did a great job of portraying a sassy and egotistic yet vulnerable on the inside Jace. He and our Lily Collins made such an amazing Clace. Their moments were the ones that made me cry the most. That being said, Lily Collins was our perfect Clary, she has the best 'scared face' as well as the expression of a strong and brave heroine. Our very own Canadian, Kevin Zegers, played an amazing Alec Lightwood. The glances that he 'snuck' at Jace were so intense and how he portrayed his hate towards Clary was simply incredible. Robert Sheehan, who was funny as well as heartbreaking, was a perfect best friend. My heart broke for him when he caught Jace and Clary outside her room, kissing, I remember his line ""I'm the one who has always been there for you. Not him!"" the most and my heart shattered. Jemima West portrayed Isabelle extremely well, I love her accent and she's such a strong and independent woman just like Isabelle Lightwood. Our high warlock of Brooklyn, Godfrey Gao, never ceases to impress me. I expected him to have a Taiwanese accent, but instead he surprised me with perfect English. He really pulled off the glitter look and the cat eyes. Lastly, let's talk about the amazing Jonathan Rhys Meyers. I couldn't have asked for a better Valentine Morgenstern. He acted out the whole 'bad guy' thing perfectly. His voice to his clothing (except for maybe the dreadlocks/braids), everything gave me chills whenever I saw him. The battle between him and Jace was epic, the fight sequences looked extremely well thought out and not forced. This movie was practically just seeing the book come to life; there were so many exact scenes with the lines from the book. Although Harald Zwart changed some things, it was better than any book to movie adaptation that I've ever seen.The infamous greenhouse scene was simply perfect. From the midnight flower to the kiss and even Hugo was exactly how I imagined it, except the kiss could've been more like a 'first kiss'. The way that Clary and Jace almost kiss, leaving both of them disappointed, but then Jace pulls Clary to him. I'm melting inside, I couldn't ask for a better OTP. Jamie and Lily did a great job satisfying the fans.Mother Dorothea getting possessed by a Greater Demon, and fatally hurting Alec broke my heart, because when Alec grabbed Mother Dorothea from behind, he was yelling at Clary to run. This symbolizes that he cares about Clary because Jace cares about her.The tarot cards, the truth behind the Morgenstern Ring, the broken hearted looks on Jace and Clary's face when they found out they were siblings. Everything was well planned, and like I said before, it was literally watching the book come to life. I will be anticipating the release of City of Ashes which will begin filming on September 23, 2013 as well as the release of City of Heavenly Fire (last book of the series) on May 9, 2014.(fangirlnostalgia.weebly.com)",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones

The review contains spoilers, but here is a non-spoiler list of just a few issues with the film.1. The attractive and intelligent Lily Collins is reduced to a stuttering, whining, heartless whore.2. The film tries to justify dressing everyone up like a hooker.3. The story features a token.4. The movie ends. Twice.5. The story glorifies selfishness and hormonal decisions.6.

You know, sometimes, they hire a director who is known for portraying the best action and so all the other things like acting and chemistry are ruined and sometimes, it's vice-versa. But Harald Zwart brought out everything in this movie perfectly!The action, the comedy, the romance, the chemistry, the drama, everything is perfectly awesome.The cast is perfect and exactly as described in the books. They're acting was breath-taking and otherworldly.Their is almost no CGI in this movie. The stunts are all done by the actors themselves, which is exactly what this movie needed the most. It is not at all fake-looking.The soundtrack does complete justice to it too! The songs are amazing and describe certain situations so perfectly, it's unbelievable! Go listen to ""Heart by Heart"" by Demi Lovato, ""When the Darkness Comes"" by Colbie Caillat and ""Almost is Never Enough"" by Ariana Grande and Nathan Sykes.All in all, I think Harald and the cast should be proud of what they've done.P.S. don't listen to the critics. They seem to have Twilight stuck in their minds. They're 40 year old men who never take anything aimed at a teenage audience seriously.Oh, and go read The Mortal Instruments series and it's prequel series The Infernal Devices, too! You won't regret it!",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
345,fogleallison,Not bad,5,2 March 2015,"First let me say i haven't read the books.I didn't think this was by any means deserving of any awards. However it was a fine little movie to see for free on Cinemax. I agree with other reviews about Clary the lead character. I think (I like lily colins not commenting on her acting at all) she was the wrong actress for the part. The only part that seemed right was the chemistry between her and the lead guy. The writing was not spectacular. at all, it was terrible with a few decent one liners that were relatively funny. such as, ""you down graded from a ginger bread house to a one bedroom,"" and then the commentary outside the bedroom door was pretty funny, not all of it just a few lines. after talking with a friend who does love these books and she described book version of Clary to me, we agreed that the studio, writers whomever turned her into Bella Swan. They dumbed her down apparently to being just another girl who needs a special superhero kind of guy to save her and to obsess over. I won't lie the only reason this movie got a half way decent review from me is because the guy who plays Jace. Which is a major problem for the book lovers I guess. I thought he took crap lines and made them work for the most part, some of the lines there was no way to make them not cheesyI didn't like Hodge, that actor too often is used for that sort of character, it made him predictable I knew upon seeing him that he was a bad guy to some degree. They misused Johnathan Rhys Meyers in his role. That guy can turn on the charisma and charm the pants off anyone. But in this role they made him just crazy rather than as I was told the book version of Valentine which would have done well with Jonathan Rhys Meyers, if they had let him be charming rather than insane. The movies that do well don't just have attractive villains, or villains that you don't like, they have villains that make your skin crawl or that you like for some reason or people that actually scare you, just the thought of them scares you. He could have easily done all three of these. Instead they had him play an insane person that was so clearly nuts and power hungry that they took all possible fear or likability from him. I mean look at Captain Hook (original to story not Disney) and Maleficent both have a number of screws loose, but they are charming and yet terrifying at the same time. perfect villains. I'm not surprised that none of the other books are being turned into movies. It wasn't so much the cast that ruined this as much as the writers who were being told what to do by the directors who are told what to do by a studio. They tried to take a book series and make it more ""typical""",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
346,wraytogo,"Great Movie for everyone, not just the Twilight crowd",9,20 August 2013,"First of all you need to know this review is coming from a 39 year old Male who has never read the books. Having heard the hype that this was the next twilight series (which I dutifully, but barely endured as a good husband)... this movie is NOTHING LIKE TWILIGHT AT ALL. Heres why:This is a movie made for more then just teenage girls and soccer mom's. It's has real action, solid acting, good cinematography, and dwells more on the storyline then romance.Having never read the Mortal Instruments books, I was a little leery of seeing the movie and being totally lost. My fears were unfounded as the first hour of the show does a solid job of laying out the storyline. The first hour did seem a little long for me, but was well worth it and necessary as it made the last hour understandable and fly by with its non-stop action. This is nothing like what I was expecting after having to endure the twilight films with their horrible acting and cheesy cinematography. As well as multiple one-hit wonders of werewolf/vampire/demon shows that have come out since. This show had legitimate effects, great action scenes, and some really good acting performances. Here's my breakdown:Effects: From the beginning this film proves it's a step above with cinematography and effects. The demons were gruesome, scary, and awesome! When supposed humans turn to demons, this is done very well. One questionable effect towards the beginning of the show was easily forgotten due to the many excellent effects during the whole show.Action: Having seen Jamie Campbell Bower on the red carpets just moments before seeing the show, I had serious worries about him being able to pull off a believable action figure due to his skinny frame. Oddly, it was the action scenes where I enjoyed his acting the best and believed he was the main man. On the whole, the fight scenes were very engaging, particularly the ending sequences. There were two times though, I wished they had made the fight scenes a little longer to show more of a struggle to overcome.Acting: This is where I was most pleasantly surprised. Lily Collins and Robert Sheehan stole the show in terms of solid, believable performances. Jamie did a convincing job and exceeded my expectations, but did fall a little short at subtle times as his skinny frame could not be overcome in the shot. His attempt to be seen as tough when his stature said otherwise caught me at times. I felt like all the performers were engaging though, with the exception of the role of Magnus. I'm not sure if it was his acting or the role they put him in, but it just didn't seem to fit the character he could/should have been. Readers may feel differently here, I was just confused if he was intended to be a tough guy or a joke.Storyline: Understandably they had to lay the foundation of the storyline, which for the first hour they did. There was a lot of information to take in the first hour and honestly I began to doubt how they were going to take this load of info and tie it all together by the end. I was amazed at how well they did it! The last hour flew by as they did an excellent job of tying in each element and doing it with very compelling drama.Overall I'd give the movie a B+. Solid acting and action stood out and will make a very satisfying experience for any non-reader who watches the show.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
347,lawrencesporing43,Better then what critics are saying!,9,24 August 2013,"The movie was absolutely brilliant.The truth is I have been a fan of TMI for a really long time. I have loved all Clares books. So when I heard about the movie I was a little apprehensive. However the movie really was phenomenal. For the most part it was true to the book, the acting was outstanding (especially from Jamie Campbell and Robert Sheehan), and the effecting were stunning.The movie also had a lot of action and special effects which made it fun to watch. Id recommend it to anyone.With that being said I hate what critics are saying about the movie. They seem to hate the movie just because of its YA origins. Not every book to movie is imitating Harry Potter and the film adaptions of Twilight sucked. Critics need to stop comparing it to those movies and see it for what it is. Its also quite clear that most reviewers paid the movie no attention as almost every critic review has misinformation in their articles.My advise ignore the critics and give this movie a chance.

The story had good pacing, nicely put-together shots, a complete story, and a nice ending. Even though the ending wasn't exactly as expected having read the books, it told an amazing story. The aspects of movies that people like such as love were even amplified to suit the taste of the general movie audience. It has everything you could want in a story. It was just a nice, successful project. As far as casting and characters go, it was perfectly done. There are movies where the characters are reduced to things like just a love interest, but with this one, the characters stood up strongly.

The acting was spit on, there wasn't a moment when I thought - Oh. The casting too, though at first I wasn't sure about a few characters, after watching it I'm glad about who was cast. There are a few slight changes from the books but nothing crucial and nothing that I minded, just things to keep the movie from dragging on too long. Though I believe the movie was slightly short on explanation, it wasn't enough for it through off viewers who haven't read the books. I fully recommend it!

350,configuratiion,Two hours of my life I'll never get back...,3,22 August 2013,"There are so many things wrong with this movie, it made me want to scream. I cannot forgive the scene where she freezes the demons. As a group, instead of killing the frozen demons, they walk through the demons and wait for them to unfreeze and have the demons kill the werewolves. Come on! They can kill off the werewolves with more demons. There are so many little things like that that just made the movie stupid for anyone who's older than 15.Oh, and the incest theme, come on. Put two and two together people, and get a frigging DNA test. Also, when ""someone"" from the inside has let the demons in, think about it, by a process of elimination, there's 5 of you, 4 of whom were together. Just a thought, it'd be the one who wasn't with you. Ta-dah! I really wanted to like this movie, the premise is fantastic. The actors did a very good job with such a silly script, and the special effects are cool.

I think that the producers really deserve a second chance, meaning letting them film the sequel. The effects were great, and even though they changed things in between, like locations and who did what, it still made sense. The movie was brilliantly made and I think you should really go see it! They always change things in movies, but does that really make the movie bad? At first I thought the guy they picked for Jace wouldn't live up to the book-Jace because of his looks, but he did. He is a great actor and he really WAS Jace. All the other actors were perfectly chosen for their parts, too. All in all, I am happy with the movie.

That being said, I was pretty disappointed. I understand the book was long, and you have to fit it all in, which is fine, but it was all wrong. They left out an entire character that is important throughout the rest of the series. From when they go to Madame Dorothea on, nothing like the book. In the book, Luke has a much bigger role! Which he should.. In the movie, it doesn't show how important he is to Clary or how much he cares for her. Also, valentine takes Jace. He leaves the institute with Jace and the cup once Hodge hands it to him. The whole fight never takes place at the institute, demons never swarm the institute, and Luke is the one that fights Valentine, not Jace. Clary doesn't start drawing runes until the second book. Church wasn't even in the movie, which also goes with the infernal devices. That being said, I did enjoy the cast. I think they all portrayed the characters in the book very well!

As for sticking with the books, be prepared to be so happy at the start, they keep up well with it for the start of the film, messing details like when Simon wears his 'Made In Brooklyn' top, but then towards the end it's just, hey, lets change this, and that, and this other thing. OH AND WE MUST NOT LET THEM THINK IT WAS ACTUAL INCEST. Therefore undermining a huge part of the storyline of the next two books, and what will be the next two movies.

The take on the demons and the shadow hunters that they were going for was completely different than what i believe cassandra clare was going for.

There was 1 min (Birthday candle part) it almost went all Disney for my liking.... cringe....!! Hope they don't repeat any of this in the next film & find better music that suits the moody darkness of the film.

""You know, when most girls say they want a big rock they don't literally mean a big rock."" a nd many, many more, I just can't remember them. Also, the attention to detail was incredible. The entryway to the City of Bones said facilis descensus averni. Jamie was absolutely amazing as Jace. If you had any doubts about him after seeing the trailer, they should be gone. He could so easily flick between being a vulnerable little boy talking about his falcon to a sarcastic little ass that we all love. Also, his seens with Lily were beautiful. Especially the Greenhouse scene. But I'll get to that. Lily was so good. So good. She just became Clary from the moment she came on screen. When I was watching her, I didn't see Lily Collins playing Clary Fray. I just saw Clary Fray. Her scenes with Robbie and Jamie, again, were wow. So much emotion. Robbie, Jemima and Kevin were great of course. It's funny to see Kevin being such a little bitch to Lily and then see their interviews together. I know we didn't see much Jemima in the press tours or clips, but the only reason I can think of was to keep the surprise — she was fantastic. Fantastic. I can't think back to a single flaw about her interpretation of Izzy. Now, Robbie — we all knew Robbie was going to be good. But he was more than good — he wasn't even really good. He was A++++. Above and beyond. I can't even remember how I picture Simon when reading the books now because he just is Simon. Aidan and Lena were flawless, as expected. Jonathan was terrifying. I did notice that some of Godfrey's dialogue sounded a bit strange, so I do think they voiced Magnus over, but it was still good. They recorded Godfrey's (Magnus) voice again because it was hard to understand or difficult to hear, so that is why. Mystery solved! I know some people were worried about the music, but don't! The only time they played bits from the soundtrack was the Hotel Dumort fight scene, the Greenhouse scene and the ending scene. Speaking of the Greenhouse scene: fsajkfdffsdcdsgfs. Jace told Clary about his falcon and his father and gave Clary the witchlight. The kiss made me squeal. It lasted for quite a while, let me tell you. It was so passionate ohmygod. Heart by Heart started playing, but it was low and didn't sound bad at all. Let me just say something: Jamie and Lily's chemistry was off the charts. Every time they so much as looked at each other I got butterflies. It was true to the book as much as it could be. Things were switched here and there — for example, the final battle takes place at the Institute, but it;s no big deal because it doesn't affect the plot at all and makes room for some really awesome and badass Izzy scenes. Also, the audience does find out that Jace and Clary aren't related, but the two of them don't find out. Also, you never know which one of them is the child of Valentine, so that's cool. There is a lot of Simon and Isabelle interaction, guys! No romantic stuff, obviously, but more than there was in the books which is so fun. Oh! Also, Alec and Magnus guys. Alec and Magnus. The part where Magnus is like, you can come in but only because of your hot friend and Jace and Isabelle are like yo thanks but then Magnus goes, uh, nope, the one with the blue eyes is IN THE MOVIE. And then Alec looks so adorably uncomfortable and Magnus has eye sex with him. Later he comes and heals Alec. Yay! All in all, it was so good. Better than I imagined. Go see it!",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
361,flavia-sousa-87,"All so perfect, I want more movies (Spoilery Review)",10,23 August 2013,"I really really loved the movie, the scenery and the cgi were impeccable. The effects seemed so real, but I guess that's also because the movie really doesn't rely much on cgi and most scenes were made with less cgi possible. I'm in love with that portal, I need one. The GREENHOUSE SCENE: let me say it was exactly as I imagined when I read the book. The script was very well written and smart, also funny. It's quite an accomplishment having such an amazing script for a PG-13 movie. And Zwart guided the team marvelously, I am impressed. And I need him guiding the team through the other movies.Now, cast: Kevin Zegers as Alec: NEEDS MORE SCREEN TIME AND LINES We got just a few scenes, what was a shame and I hope they make it up to us next movie. Kevin proved once again why he deserves a place in the hall of fame (just saying). When he meets Magnus, HIS EXPRESSION! His expression is like ""this really hot Asian piece of sexiness wants a piece of me"", OK no. That was my mind. But he was definitely like ""I'm too shy but I really loved the flirting"". He had that silly face on, you know? When people are in love and looking at person they love or when someone really interesting compliments you and you get all silly. But at that exact moment, his face changes because he remembers everyone else is there. It's just like all the stories people tell about meeting their one true love and I loved how they worked it. Kevin and Lily on screen ARE AMAZING! I mean, the chemistry is perfect, both portrayed they characters marvelously. Specially around each other. You could feel Alec's hatred for Clary as you feel winter in your face. Really.Jemima West as Izzy: NEEDS MORE SCREEN TIME AND LINES Jemima's portrayal of Izzy was even better than a thought. I was hoping for something pretty good and got something out of this world. Not only was she convincing, she stole the spotlight to herself just by being in scene. Not matter how much everyone tried to focus on Lily, Jemima has that kind of presence that could shadow the sun. She was tough, fierce and beautiful. And, most of all, carefree. Isabelle through and through. I loved it. I was a slight bit apprehensive with Jemima because the Lightwoods are my favorite characters and we always get protective, but I knew I wouldn't be disappointed with Kevin, I've known him for a good while. But Jemima was awesome! Jamie CB as Jace: I'll say what I've been saying since yesterday To you who didn't believe him, BUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRNNNN!!! :D HE PROVED YOU WRONG! Best Jace impossible. Amazing, talented actor. He made my heart break after the greenhouse scene and during it.THE SCENE WITH VALENTINE, HE NAILED IT! It's a hard scene to portray and he did just flawlessly.Robert Sheehan as Simon: NEEDS MORE SCREEN TIME Awesome! Perfect! Nothing to add. He played Simon just as I imagined Simon would be. What's great because I love Simon so much and he is the character who has the best development in the books, in terms of quality. So I am sure now (even more than before) that Robbie is just the man for the job.Lily Collins as Clary Fray: I really don't have much time now, but I'll tell you this: I liked her Clary better than the book's. Lily IS talented and under the right direction, she's gonna become even more skilled and grow into her talents. I was positively surprised. Because Lily is really different from Clary, she's sweet and lovable. And Clary is Well A ginger.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
362,Eliz-barnes,Critics are being way too harsh! It was great!,10,23 August 2013,"I think the critics are being overly harsh. It had a great pace, didn't drag on like parts of Twilight. They also forget that with any first movie, you have to establish the characters with a little back story so everyone understands what's going on. I understand that, why is it hard for critics to. Also, most of them are older adults which isn't the target audience anyway. I looked up critic reviews of Beautiful Creatures and they rated that movie at 46%?! TMI: City of Bones is so much better than that movie. It works out better for the male audience as well. There are more fight scenes and action with a fast pace that will draw the male audience members more so than twilight did. I think it was a great attempt and am fully confident that they will make adequate changes in the sequels to come. For all those who were skeptical, Jamie did a good job playing Jace. His attitude was right on key!",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
363,ali_cee,I was laughing and crying for all the RIGHT reasons.,10,23 August 2013,"""The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones"" is a movie in which it is very easy to connect with the characters. It has you laughing one minute, makes you feel heartbroken the next, and also has you in awe of the supernatural elements. ""The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones"" is a story about a teenager called Clary who witnesses a murder that nobody else can see happening right in front of their eyes, and, if that wasn't scary enough, her mother ends up being abducted and Clary has to rely on the help of those murderers in order to find her mother.""Those murderers"" happen to be Shadowhunters, humans who have angelic blood in their veins, giving them abilities to slay demons and protect the world from demon invasions. I don't want to spoil too much, but this film is basically a rescue mission in a supernatural society which disguised by glamours in the middle of New York City. It's all happening right under the noses of the ""mundane"" human society.Having read the book, I had expectations, of course I did. I wasn't surprised to find that the movie had changed a few aspects of the book. They made a movie that has you glued to the screen in wonder because you are being introduced constantly to many new aspects of this new world. It opens up to the viewer at the same time as Clary is learning about it so it really helps you understand her character.Lily Collins is a strong lead as Clary. The scene that stood out for me in a, ""This is completely Clary,"" sense was the first Madame Dorothea scene. Jamie Campbell Bower plays Jace Wayland, the best Shadowhunter of his age. Bower does a wonderful job of capturing Jace's vulnerability and is brilliant at delivering the type of attitude needed for this character. Robert Sheehan works brilliantly beside Collins and Bower and brings an outstanding Simon Lewis to the big screen. Simon is Clary's best friend and feels extremely threatened by Jace's sudden presence in Clary's life. His comedic delivery is spot on and he is simply brilliant. Kevin Zegers, Jemima West, Lena Headey and Aidan Turner all show great strength in their abilities in their respective roles.""The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones"" is highly entertaining in the sense that there is an abundance of humour threaded throughout a full-on action movie (the cast did the majority of their own stunt-work) without it seeming forced. Many people will hear the expression, ""love triangle"" and want to immediately turn away from the movie, but I must stress that this movie is not like Twilight. The central storyline is not about a girl and her love interests. It's about a girl trying to rescue her mother and finding out the truth of her heritage. It is a world full of supernatural creatures, but the presence of vampires and werewolves is nowhere near the central importance of the story.While the second half of the movie seems rushed and there are one or two clumsy moments, ""The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones"" is a very good watch. The acting is brilliant, it's funny, it's action-packed, it's romantic elements do nothing but add to an already interesting plot. I loved it, and I am definitely going to see it again.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
364,laurenwatson1994,Amazing!,9,23 August 2013,"This film was adapted from the fantastic book series by Cassandra Clare. Although there are some very big differences to the book, the film still manages to capture the beauty of Cassi's extraordinary and unique Shadowhunter world. Although there could have been a lot more action brought to the film and the ending should have definitely been different. I think the film introduced viewers to this world well without bombarding them with every single detail of what The Mortal Instruments were about. This was really well captured through the excellent cast who were all perfectly matched to their characters. I really believe Jamie Bower was the only person who could really capture Jace's rough and hard man exterior whilst showing occasionally that he can have as many emotions and feelings as others especially through his love for Clary (Lily Collins). Despite many critics saying this is just another attempt on twilight and Harry Potter, I believe the City of Bones was an excellent introduction for the Mortal Instruments series and will be in a league all of its own. It will grow and develop throughout its sequels and I know that the revelation of Clary and Jace not actually being siblings so early in the series will not ruin the follow on in City of Ashes because the characters don't know the truth only the audience does. It also makes the film more open to a wider variety of fans. If you haven't seen this film I highly recommend it. It is an amazing way to bring all this new obsession with vampires and werewolves and magic together in one place. The cheesy lines really make the film funnier rather than undesirable. It has a strange appeal that will no doubt draw in more and more people as it grows in popularity !! Enjoy!!!!!",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
365,lorna-harris214,Slightly different than the books but excellent,10,23 August 2013,"The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones was definitely a wonderful book-to-movie adaption! I had been anticipating this movie since they announced filming (being a fan of the books since 2008). I took my best friend, who also loves this series, and my boyfriend, who had never read the books and never planned to. The movie was amazing and definitely works for people who haven't read the books. Some things were left unexplained and the ending was different than the book but I definitely recommend this to anyone, even non book readers (although I highly recommend reading the books first). My boyfriend, the one who attended (and I paid for xD) just because I wanted to go so bad, actually loved this movie! And I think he might be considering reading the books (or at least I hope so).Anyway, this movie adaption was amazing and I am very hopeful for the next movies in the 6 book series. :) I hope you guys go to see it, and if you're an adult who doesn't like that sort of thing, at least take your kids to watch it!",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
366,Loobylou97,A must see!,10,23 August 2013,"Contains spoilersA wonderful action/comedy/romance perfect for all. Read all the books in the Mortal Instruments series before I saw the film so I knew what to expect, and I must say it was by far better than I expected. Beautiful acting from the cast especially from Lily, Jace, and Robert. The Greenhouse scene was favourite. The standers were very high for that scene because of Cassandra's description in the book and they reached it! Beautiful and perfect are the only words I can say to describe that scene. Carrying on to the scene between Clary and Simon was heartbreaking, wonderful performance from Robert. The cast played their parts perfectly, they are truly the characters. Yes, there was differences between the book and film, but it makes it more exciting. Very excited that they are filming City of Ashes next month, already! I went with my eleven year old cousin, eighteen year old sister and fifty year old mum who all enjoyed it and can't wait for the sequel. And I wouldn't know who wouldn't love this film. It deserves to make all the films in the series",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
367,jaimielpaige,I really enjoyed it,8,4 September 2013,I really enjoyed the Movie though I wish they had followed the book a bit more. But I always feel the books are way better than the movies. My biggest pet peeve was Clary's hair. Being a redhead myself I feel that her hair should have actually been fiery red as described in the book. But overall I really liked the movie. After Twilight finished their Movies my girlfriends and I needed another series of films to go and see. These will be perfect for girls' might out away from the children. Good those of you have not read the books you definitely should. They are very entertaining. I'm 28 years old and I still enjoyed them. Will post definitely be seeing the next movie I'm the series.,The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
368,mpurdy1030-772-496775,Horribly disappointed,2,23 August 2013,"Cassandra Clare's Mortal Instruments is one of my favorite series and I was so excited to see this movie. I've been to plenty of book-to-movie showings, so I knew not to expect the exact same thing, but regardless, I went in with high expectations. The beginning was... weird (and out of order, but that's just my OCD, no biggie). However, this movie was so horribly different from the book that it lost all of it's value. I don't just mean the events were slightly moderated to save time, I mean they changed the entire plot. Jace wasn't terrible- could've been cockier, Clary was horribly over-dramatic, Magnus was expressionless, and they managed to ruin my favorite character: Valentine. He became a bland, one- sided villain, unlike the ingeniously dynamic character Clare made him out to be. The movie had changes in it that ruptured the foundation of the book and a lot of what it stands for, ruining the ingenuity of the plot and the world that Clare built which had me so enraptured from the beginning. It's a shame because they had such potential with this movie. I still can't understand how they could take such a great story line and decide that it was only acceptable to warp it to a point beyond recognition....",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
369,bourgetteelleagrossi,You will like it if you don't mind changes.,6,23 August 2013,"Hi All, Just came back from watching the movie and I was really disappointed. There wasn't enough crucial info provided to the people who didn't read the books. Nothing about the Seraph dagger and their name, not enough emphasis on Clary drawing passion .. Hodge have been changed a little too much to my taste.What about Jace he is suppose to be handsome and all but damn he's really bland in my taste .. I guess I could go on and on but I think I already made my point. You will like this movie if you didn't read the books or if you don't mind big changes. My 2 cents (Sorry about my bad English)",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
370,sorachic08,city of bones ignore the critics,8,24 August 2013,This movie is fast paced and very well acted. As a fan of the books I was nervous. Those considering this movie should know that is action packed. It is not slow like twilight or hunger games. I love twilight but for the love triangle and the volturi mostly. Hunger games was very unemotional and katniss sleeps a lot. This film is setting up a new world and a large cast of characters so it has to explain a few things. The next movie will dive right in as the series itself is full of fighting and epic battles. We have barely seen what valentine will do in this movie. Most critics gave it a poor rating because they couldn't keep up. I always wonder why people like that review movies. But kudos to them for admitting they are slow. By the way I am 42 years old so I'm not one of the poor teens negated and dismissed by the critics. Fans please see this movie if you want to get it respected. Also critics keep comparing it to other franchises and saying it doesn't measure up. But you should all recall that they hated those too. Maybe critics are too old and stuffy or slow like they admit they are. I loved the chemistry between Clary and jace. It is very hard to come by.,The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
371,tokidokigrl,Very Promising,7,24 August 2013,"I rarely like film adaptations of books, but this movie surprised me. Despite the changes to the storyline of the books, I think they pulled it off. The movie still made sense and had a satisfying conclusion. I really see the promise of this film and the films that may follow. Pros: -The chemistry between Jace and Clary -Jamie Campbell Bower did a fantastic job playing Jace and capturing Jace's snarky side -Simon was perfect -The film managed to produce the right reaction from the audience at the right points in the story -Action scenes -Special effects (the demons were wonderfully frightful and disturbing)Cons: -The movie gave away a huge spoiler in the books -The portrayal of Valentine completely ignored his dangerous powers of manipulation and cunning, and instead portrayed a reckless and desperate man -Valentine's motive was not clear -Movie did a patchy job of explaining the world and back story, but given how complex it is, this is not surprising -Godfrey Gao's dubbed voiceOverall, I enjoyed the movie and am looking forward to future films. I suggest you ignore the critics and go in with an open mind.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
372,aobryan2,Do you really disagree with the critics?,5,24 August 2013,"Let me start off by saying I DID read the books. Now I know that the movie is not going to match the book completely, and that is understandable. However, that being said, I have never seen a movie that is based off of a book, that strays so far! I don't understand some peoples reviews on here who read the book. Basically, the director took the book and basically just used what I would consider an ""outline"" of the story and then filled in the rest with his own. This irritated me like no other. SPOILERS***** Simon was not even turned into a rat! That seemed to be a pretty big part to me, not to mention that it was just Jace and Clary who saved him, not the whole group. This helped portray just how much Jace would do for Clary, such as going behind his partners (Alec) back! Then they rode the motorcycle off of the building. I was really excited to see that. Hmm too bad that never happened! I was really depressed with the Silent brothers. They seemed very scary in the book, and although they were creepy in the movie, it just wasn't the same. Valentine was too soft. He did not match the character in the book at all. Bane was so spunky in the book, and he was just a bland character in the movie, which really depressed me because I loved him in the book. I could go on forever, but I will stop now.Now I am going to review the movie as if I NEVER read the books. That being the case, it has something promising aspects. My boyfriend who never read the books actually enjoyed it somewhat. However, the actors and actresses needed some more training. Sometimes when Bane talked, he seemed like he was reading from a script. There was barely any emotion. Hopefully with the second movie, he does better with this. Now Clary, oh dear Clary. She tried too hard. She tried to act scared when she was supposed to be, she tried to act angry and tough at the right times, she portrayed the right emotions...but she tried to hard! Clary also needs more training as an actress. That is how Twilight became such a horrible movie. Half of he cast sucked! Please don't do that with this series!!! Clary was just to cliché and I really really hope this does not happen with the second movie.This movie is promising, if only minor things would have been tweaked. I am hoping the director and cast learn from their mistakes, and hopefully the second movie will be better.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
373,kmariew101,Great movie that is unlike any other.,10,24 August 2013,"I am a long time fan of this series and was not disappointed. I honestly have no idea why everyone is comparing this to either Twilight or Harry Potter; If you are looking for another movie exactly like twilight, this is not for you. It has some romance in it, but it also has far too much action in it to be close to twilight. If you are looking for a movie just like Harry Potter, then this movie is also not for you. It does have action in it, but this world is nothing like the Harry Potter world and it has too much romance in it for it to be like Harry Potter.Overall, I absolutely loved this movie. Several of my friends that went along with me, who have never read the book, also loved it. It is a great movie with awesome special effects, and you do not have to read the book in order to understand what is happening. Cannot wait for the next movie.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
374,dhammond64,A really fun and entertaining fantasy film go see it and enjoy!,10,24 August 2013,"Went to see this film despite some not so good reviews and also after reading the books. Was so glad I did. Thoroughly enjoyed. I guess if I were to compare to any other fantasy type it would be along the lines of Harry Potter but a teen version. But don't write this film off as 'just for teens' just because it has teens in it. That would be like saying Harry Potter is 'just for kids' because it has a lot of kids in it. Overall the acting was good, casting of the characters accurate, except I was a bit worried about the character Valentine and Jonathan Rhys Myers who was cast in that role. I doubted he would work out. Happily I was proved wrong. Valentine's character has been cast well, as Jonathan Rhys Meyers brings to life the vile hostility and obsessional personality that the character Valentine has. So with that, just had to give Mortal Instruments 10/10. Went to see this with my husband who has never read the books and he enjoyed. Therefore would recommend this film to anyone who likes fantasy films that are action packed and also fun. Finally, I really wish people would stop comparing every fantasy film that is being made post Twilight with Twilight as the acting in this film is good, anything but wooden and it isn't a Vampire film so why are these comparisons being made? To compare this film to Twilight, is to compare Twilight to Pirates of the Caribbean, simply outrageous. Go see it for yourself but don't go in there with the view to review, just enjoy.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
375,whitfilj,"A teen movie through and through, but much better than I was expecting",9,24 August 2013,"Honestly after a series of mediocre YA adaptations this one hits the spot. Yes while the script is a little weak in places the actors tend to do an amazing job with what they have. As someone who has read the book I'm probably more than a little biased, but I really liked the movie. Jemima West, Robert Sheehan, and Jamie Campbell Bower were the ones who stuck with me though because they did such a phenomenal job. Jemima perfectly captures Izzy on the whole with her protection of the people she views as family, which is something that I think a lot of people end up overlooking. Robert was so Robert is the film and you could see his own personality leaking through which was perfect. His American accent was very strong and if I didn't already know that he was Irish I probably wouldn't have even been able to tell. Now JCB blew me away honestly. When I found out he was Jace a couple of years ago, I had so many doubts and now I look back on that in shame because Jamie was such a perfect Jace. He was sarcastic, but vulnerable and it was phenomenal. I loved every second of his performance. My single complaint involving Jace lies more with the script than anything. The script needed a lot of work. I loved the lines taken straight from the book, but some of them were just so so cheesy. They pulled it off, but only just.The CGI wasn't distractingly bad and the scenes with the demons were probably the best ones in my opinion, but it definitely could have used some work.Personally I would recommend any fan of the books to see the movie, its fairly faithful to the book. Of course there are changes, but that's natural. If you're scared off by the Critic's Score don't be. It really is very much a teen movie and that may be its biggest problem. It isn't going to appeal to them, but I found it very enjoyable.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones

The effects were great and even though they did change some parts, I still loved it. The only part that was ""eh"" was when the pop music came up at The Hotel Dumort, but the greenhouse music was fine. I thought the music idea was very original and interesting. I cried three times and sobbed at the end when I realized that it was over (also When the Darkness Comes was playing at the end... the feels overtook me.)The pacing was good and the action scenes blew me away. This movie kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time and I was also clutching my popcorn (I barely ate any....) The books were better as always, but this can easily be the best movie ever. I brought my friend who hasn't read the books yet to watch it with me and she loved it! She didn't find it complicating and she described the movie as intense and dark. She went into this movie expecting it to be ""just another cool movie"", but afterwards, she said that it was nothing she expected it to be! It was better than she expected!

377,araquest,Did anyone actually read these books??!!??,1,25 August 2013,"Harold Zwalt and Jessica Postigo sure didn't.Although Cassandra Clare's book, ""The City of Bones,"" read like a poorly planned high schooler's first attempt at painting an epic novel of wanderlust and love blackened by the reality of a dark cruel world, her books graduated in quality and she grew into a writer. Still, she is burden with the lack of foresight needed to garden the authority and respect of structured foreshadowing that cultivated the cherished love of J. K. Rowling's fans.Heedlessly, Jessica Postigo's rewrite and Harlod Zwat blatant disdain for understanding the piece he was creating has left us with a gilded unprepossessing garble of two books jigsawed together like a 5th grader attempting to tape and glue together two Fabergé eggs.Forget the poor directing, forget the script rewrite to fit the time allowance; to what end does changing the villain from a large, Nazi poster boy, blonde almost silver haired, smooth talking, skill-fulled, man that people mistakenly trusted and adored to an oily, black haired, tiny man who was simply tricked and pathetically kicked into another dimension by an uncharacteristic action Clary would never have gotten away with. Lets not forget that for two books Hodges was a scared man who couldn't stand up to a wet paper bag let alone help the children stop Valentine's invasion.

380,mrnorthjersey,Review From Someone That Never Read The Books,4,25 August 2013,"I just finished watching the movie and having never read the books and no knowledge of any of the characters or story lines I feel I can share a different perspective than those that have read the books.1st the Harry Potter comparisons are fair for example you have these 2 worlds co existing but in The Mortal Instruments the two intertwine more than in the Potter films at least in my opinion.My biggest problem with the film is all the loose ends left at the end of the film. I expect a loose end or two when it's done in sort of a cliff hanger where you expect more of the story to be told but in this movie they did what has to be the poorest job of wrapping things up I have seen in quite some time.If you read the book then your good cause you have those answers but me? I left with so many questions that I felt as if someone spliced out scenes in the film.These are my gripes. ***Spoiler Alert*** Hodge who turns out to have betrayed the shadowhunters is last seen closing up the opening that allowed the demons entry. There is no resolution as far as is he cast out for his betrayal? Did he die closing the opening? Did the others ever find out of his betrayal? Then you have Alec who is in love with Jace and is last seen being healed and expected to survive but do they ever go back to show him? No. It sure would be nice to know if that near death experience had any effect on his desire to profess his love for Jace. Oh well.Then you have Jocelyn believe to be possibly dead turns out she is in a comatose for most of the film and the film ends how? Her still in a comatose state. Why? Is she in some alternate dimension? Is she in ""Odin sleep"" Is there a bigger part she still has to play? Would of been nice to see something that maybe suggests that. Oh and what was it she drank? Jace had the bottle. Couldn't he give the bottle to the Warlock so he can maybe create an antidote? But wait there's more. Then you have lifelong friend Simon. He is the only mundane of the bunch. Well at least he starts out as one but it seems Clary notices after rescuing him from Vampires that he has bite marks and Simon doesn't seem to need his glasses anymore. Does Simon ever find out why that is so? Does Clary ever tell him, Hey dude I think you might want to get stronger sunblock? Nope. Seems like Simon and movie goers would want to know if he is indeed a vampire or not.Then the big reveal. Clary I am your father. Oh and by the way Jace is your brother. Can someone please tell me how do you not have closure if this is indeed true or not? Jace suggesting that in his heart he doesn't believe it? I mean really? What is there no such thing as a paternity test in this universe? No Rune that can tell if they are indeed from the same blood? Sorry I just was left with way too many unresolved story lines with not even the hint of say, Hey wait till the next film and all this will be answered.If you read the books and all my points are resolved then great but at least tell anyone that has never read the books that they need to read them to understand these unresolved issues.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
381,mollychan01,great movie,8,25 August 2013,"at first, i wasn't excited to see this movie at all. i thought they had the casting all wrong but guess what; i was incredibly wrong. holy. i had read all the books and i wasn't expecting this. Jamie who played Jace did an exceptional job on him. he fitted the character so well and throughout the movie, i grown to love him. in the end, the casting was great. it was a really good movie. and to those who won't try it out because of the casting... you should just watch it. it may even change your mind like it did with me. in the end, i loved the movie. the only thing i didn't like how it was pretty fast paced and they kind of did a bit of cramming but other then that; amazing.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
382,gabbiefortunato,Best series since Harry Potter!,10,28 August 2013,"I cant even begin to describe this movie. It is action packed from beginning till end and surprisingly (having read the series) stuck close to the book. It was everything and more than I expected! The effects were spot on, an amazing cast... couldn't have picked better actors to play the characters. Im disappointed though with the ratings it getting! The ratings are so harsh and I personally believe they are inaccurate. I am pleading people to go and see it for themselves, it is a movie that can be enjoyed by all, old or young with hints of romance mixed with comedy and then the added action and drama.. its and all round movie that will get your heart racing and leave your jaws left hanging after the ending.SEE THE MOVIE! YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
383,kpiwara,Not worth the popcorn,1,26 August 2013,"A movie for teen girls with some romance, gay romance and brother-sister romance.Nothing sounds natural, everyone is a stereotype, the dialog on the piano scene sounds like it was written by a wannabe writer that has no idea how normal people talk, also, people switch sides way to easy.The story makes no sense, there's no explanation and stuff happens for no reason.So, probably whoever wrote the script did it only for those who read the books.Won't watch the others, if there are others.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones

I was a bit disappointed though - although it was fun to watch, it felt extremely condensed/rushed with hardly any of the back story at all. When compared to the book, the movie is extremely shallow. I know that is usually the case, but I felt that it was more so the case with this movie than any other I have read/seen. Like I said, it was still fun to go see, but I was expecting way more out of this movie. Casting was alright, although I felt it could have been better, especially with the background characters. And I was quite distracted by the fact that it appeared that the actor playing Magnus Bane was lip syncing ALL of his lines.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones

However, i ended up really really liking it! The acting was great, the cast was perfect and the effects were awesome. it's sad to see so many bad reviews and i hope people don't let that stop them from watching this movie. i never write reviews but seeing all the bad reviews i was worried that it would harm the sequel's chances of coming to film - though it still seems to be good to go.i haven't read this book nor have i even heard of it. i am an unbiased viewer and this movie totally blew me away! it pains me to read about people comparing this to twilight! give this movie a shot. all i know is i cant wait to get this DVD!",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones

Decide for yourself.,9,27 August 2013,"I read all the negative reviews before going to see this movie, but decided I would be the judge of if it was good or not for myself. I read the book before the movie, but I didn't expect it to be word for word. If you are a fan of the books, I think that you will find this movie enjoyable if you don't go into it with unreal expectations. If you haven't read the books, I think you will just enjoy it for what it is. The actors did a great job and the fighting scenes were great. It didn't seem to long for me because there was always something going on. Critics don't always get it right. What is good for some is not good for all.

387,paradiseofpages,What the heck did i just watch!?!?!,1,27 August 2013,"I don't know what happened to this movie. I was so excited for it. I was angry the first 5 minutes into it. They completely changed the book. Yeah certain things were somewhat the same but it seemed like they just took the names of the characters, the general idea of the book, and just farted it into a script. The acting was horrible, most of the characters didn't even portray who they were supposed to be really. They put parts of book two into book one. Completely changed it all. I am so disappointed that I refuse to watch the next movie when it comes out. This was such a waste of money to watch. If any of you are TRUE mortal instrument fans, you will see my frustration, those who say this movie is good, stop pretending. You just are trying to say it is good to jump on the bandwagon. I am not afraid to say how BAD this movie was. I it would let me rate it a zero I would, but sadly 1 is the lowest I can go.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
388,igotgold-girl,go see this movie today!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,10,27 August 2013,"Wow. Really that's all I can say. Usually movie adaptations are never as good as the original books themselves, but I thought this movie was amazing!!!!!!!! Honestly for me, it was the casting of Lily Collins and Jamie Campbell Bower and the soundtrack that made this movie as great as it was for me. I think Lily and Jamie fit the roles of Clary and Jace perfectly. And the film soundtrack and score...wow. It played in perfectly and added so much emotion to the storyline.I wish people who are saying that the movie totally sucked would take a moment and think about how much work and energy and emotion and skill went into it. I honestly loved it!!!!! I would watch it every day if I could. And before you think that I'm just a little girl obsessing over how hot everybody is, think again. I've seen my fair share of terrible movies. I know what bad movies look like and this is not one of them!!!!! I can't stress that enough. My heart is breaking for Lily and Jamie and the directors because so many people are saying how terrible it is, but it is so not terrible!!! It's fantastic. It follows the story closely enough, but deviates just enough to make it interesting. I love it. I highly recommend this movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
389,ksp9000,One of the best movies seen so far,9,27 August 2013,"The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones (2013) An excellent movie to watch with a good back ground story and direction. Go for it in your weekend and you shall really love watching this movie. When gauzing the potential audience for ""The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,"" a classic Hollywood tag line comes to mind: ""You read the book. Now see the movie!"" In this case, critics say only those familiar with the source novel will be able make much of an emotional investment in this overstuffed, overlong mishap of familiar fantasy elements. Lily Collins stars as a New York City teenager who discovers that she's from a long line of half-human, half-angel demon-killers; soon, she's on a mission to rescue her mother and stop a powerful object from falling into the wrong hands.Based on a series of novels by Cassandra Clare, ""The Mortal Instruments"" story feels like a mash-up of ""Twilight"" and ""Harry Potter."" The main protagonist is Clary (Lily Collins), a seemingly typical teenager who begins drawing strange symbols in her sleep and seeing violent images that her best friend, Simon (Robert Sheehan), cannot. It turns out Clary is a shadow hunter, or a half-human, half- angel predestined to track and kill demons. Her realization coincides with the disappearance of her mother (Lena Headey), another such vigilante who's been masquerading as a bohemian artist in Brooklyn. To find her mom, Clary teams up with Simon and another shadow hunter, the sneaky, smoldering Jace (Jamie Campbell Bower). Their quest coincides with the demon-killer network's larger goal of finding a magical cup that could save or destroy humanity; Clary's mother was the only person who knew its whereabouts, but the information may also be hiding somewhere in Clary's cloudy memory. The plot gets more convoluted from there, with vampires, werewolves, witches and grotesque, oozy monsters joining the mix. The special effects are good for the most part, and the chase scenes are thrilling. If only it were clearer what everyone was running from and why.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones

Compared to many other young adult books turned to movies, this one kept my interest through the whole thing and had good, if marginally hormonal characters. Not another Beautiful Creatures, this has a plot, story, and good acting. I have not read the book, but my wife has and it encouraged her to read the whole series again, which happened to be sold out at every bookstore she went to as well as Amazon, which reinforces that lots of people are liking it, except the critics who did not give it great reviews.

393,mingustech,So sad,2,30 August 2013,"There are SO many discrepancies between the movie and the book it's almost painful. With the technical abilities of CGI etc there is no excuse that this movie was so bad and so twisted from the original story. While some important points were at least covered from the book, so many were either left out or totally twisted so that they were actually, completely opposite from the book. I was really sad to see what they had done, the story line was very choppy and skipped through the first 2/3 of the book like it was nothing. It was sad to see really, most movies at least stay ""close"" to the book, not in this case.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
394,KaitlynPerry,A must see,9,31 August 2013,"Having read the series of the mortal instruments, the first time I watched the movie, I was not impressed. I then went to see it again, as I was told it was much better if you pretend you have no idea what's going to happen. As I did, it ended up being a very good movie. The first time I watched the movie, I did not like the changes from the book that they had made. After seeing the movie a second time, I noticed why they made the changes and it made sense why they changed it. All in all, this movie is much better than it seems. I believe this movie isn't given enough credit. They did an amazing job with the special effects, and the characters were outstanding!

There were a few things that were different than the book, but other than that, the movie was amazing. Jamie Campbell Bower's acting was amazing. And oh my goodness is Kevin Zegers attractive. My favorite scene was Magnus's party. Another thing that minorly annoyed me was a few of my favorite lines from the book were cut out. People, please stop saying that this book is copying Twilight.

397,lauracondie,"Great film, with some flaws.",7,1 September 2013,"I've been in love with The Mortal Instrument series since the first page of the first book - completely absorbed all five in a couple of weeks, so I had high hopes for the film! Firstly, I think the casting is great. Jamie Campbell Bower is exactly as Jace should be, piercing and unconventionally good looking and Lilly Collins makes a good Clary.Unfortunately the writing lets the cast down. The characters aren't as strong as they are in the book, Isabella lacks any rudeness, Jace isn't abrasive enough and Simon not awkward enough. For me, this is where the issues with the film come from - there isn't enough depth to the characters. They're all a bit nice!Having said that, I went with the idea that the film wouldn't follow the same storyline as the book and so wasn't disappointed. I only hope that the films improve as they move through the series.7/10 - could be better, but loved it anyway!",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
398,rachelbinnie-780-774262,Absolutely Brilliant,10,1 September 2013,"As someone who has read the books I absolutely loved the film adaptation which is unusual for me. The film stayed true to the books keeping in all the essential moments of the books that made all the fans fall in love with them. The movie has been getting a lot of bad reviews and i just cannot understand why. It has had a lot of comparisons to other franchises such as twilight but really it is totally unique. It is filled with action, adventure, romance and, unlike most other teen films,has an extremely witty script. The effects used are fantastic and although the casting received a lot of criticism when it was first released I felt everyone involved portrayed the characters perfectly, capturing the essence of the characters in just over two hours which is not an easy task. Jamie Campbell Bower creates a fantastic Jace bringing the beloved character from the books to life perfectly. The plot is not confusing, despite what critics might say, as I know lots of people who have not read the books and absolutely loved it and understood it perfectly. Critics seem to forget that as middle aged viewers they may not enjoy it but that is not who the film was originally aimed at. That is not to say adults cannot enjoy it as I know plenty that have. The critics are too busy comparing this film to other franchises to notice how fantastic the film actually is. I for one cannot wait for it to be released on DVD and cannot wait for the sequel next year. If you want my advice you should definitely go see this film, it is a fantastic new franchise for young people with a brilliant cast.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
399,stephanie-tafoya1977,Amazing movie!,10,1 September 2013,"I cannot understand why so many film critics are being so harsh in their review of this movie. It is even harder to believe that the box office amounts have been so low.This movie is an amazing work. From the vast production work (which creates the written world of the series into the cinematic world for the movie audience), to the strong cast of actor's which help bring the characters to life beautifully on screen, it is a great movie.It draws you in and shows you a story of good versus evil... And the struggle to figure out ones place in the world, when not everything is always clear to understand. It is the story of life and how it is never easy.I believe too many people are jaded. If movies do not have large amounts of sex and violence, then they are left on the sideline. However, looking out the window or turning on the television, it is apparent to me that there is too much of that already in real life. I prefer to go to a movie theater and see something that has a well written story behind it, not one that comes from the evening news headline.This movie is not that...overly violent or ridden with useless sex scenes.The City of Bones is a truly brilliant novel series, whose movie adaptation works flawlessly on the big screen. The story line is fresh and new. It is worth seeing.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
400,lehcar132,Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,3,2 September 2013,"I talked my husband into going to this movie as I had read and enjoyed the books.Now I was expecting the movie to be different than the books, I have no problem with entire scenes being deleted as long as they are not pivotal to the storyline. What I cannot stand are things that are changed for no other reason than to be changed. Example: every single thing about Valentine, from his hair color to his personality. And why did they change the scene in the club? The way it was written in the book made a lot more sense and it would not have taken any longer to portray it that way in the movie... One more unnecessary change, her comment to Jace about him tearing off his shirt to bind her wounds, that was said at the city of bones after the silent brothers tried to remove the block from her memory, why would they move that piece of dialog to the beginning of the movie when they had only just met. Way too early for that easy banter between Clary and Jace. No reason, just a change for the heck of it.I disagree with a lot of the reviews that say the casting was awful and the acting was even worse. I think the actors did fine with what they had to work with, the dialog on the other hand was pretty bad.My main gripe however was the lack of important details. I may have missed it but I never once heard anyone mention the significance of angels. The swords were never named, nor did they glow. The stele was shown, but again, not one word of what it was. If I had sneezed I would have literally missed the fact that they used ruins at all. And what the heck... Clary just up and drew a mark on her hand that froze demons. I guess it just came to her, after all she had met the shadow hunters a few hours before, plenty of time to figure out their entire system that was not ever explained to her, she's just that good.There were many more changes that made absolutely no sense... but you get the idea. After the movie I spent about 45 minutes explaining to my husband what should have been made clear in the movie. I have read all of the books, so I knew what was going on but that should not be a prerequisite for going to a movie adaptation.The trailers for this movie were awesome, I just wish the movie had lived up to its potential. Overall I was a sad panda, and a little angry we spent $20 on a movie that could have been really good, but wasn't.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
401,jont-781-953795,more disappointing then when i saw twilight.....,3,2 September 2013,"First of all, the books are fantastic. This movie however was not. I cannot believe the author of this book is happy with the way this movie turned out, and to think there already working on/done with the next. First of all everything about this movie was wrong. Hodge, demons in the institute, the whole simon being carried away by vampires scene, clary marking her hand with a rune and slowing the demons down. The fact there was an open portal at the institute. No mention of sereph blades, nor the naming of the blades before use. Its like they used 10% of the book's idea's and character names and just randomly made up the other 90% of the movie.... I Still can't believe Hollywood does this. They should know how loyal fans are to books / characters / plots.

I loved it: the characters were funny and good actors, the plot was exciting and interesting with some funny parts, and to sum it up, it definitely didn't deserve some of the bad reviews it got. If you liked the book, go see it!It bombed on Rotten Tomatoes with people comparing it to Twilight. I don't see how it relates; just because it's a teen novel does not automatically make it similar to Twilight. The characters were different and there were plenty of plot twists to go around. This movie was a good movie to me and I recommend seeing it! Don't see it if you trust the reviews but at least give it a chance.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
404,amycorner22,fantastic,10,11 September 2013,"I would definitely recommend this film. It's not as good as the book (the films never are) and I know and they changed some things but they have to do that because they can't make the whole book and so by changing slight details it helps the members of the audience that haven't read the book understand it more easily. The plot was still exactly the same. I especially enjoyed the action sequences because they show it in detail. What Cassandra Clare does in the books, and i'm not saying this is bad, is she writes the fighting scenes from the perspective of one of the main characters and describes their experiences and emotions throughout it and not going into loads of detail about the fight. I love the way she writes and I love that she wrote it that way but the fact that they managed to interpret that into the action sequences they did I think is amazing. I would also like to point out the incredible casting. Every single person was perfect. I know that a lot of people weren't happy with Jamie Campbell Bower as Jace but he was perfect and the rest of them I can't fault either. They all acted it incredibly as well and after re-reading the book I pictured all of them in my head. I also like some of the additions they made, like the portal being a liquid that you can take out. It also made for a very entertaining punch in the face. The main reason, though, that i would recommend you see this film, is because it had me on the edge of my seat from start to finish, even though i knew what was going to happen. I really enjoyed it and I think everyone involved in making it deserves praise.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
405,liz8192,Love the Movie and this is Why!,8,17 September 2013,"I loved this Film watched it three times. I love Clary and Jace and the scene in the Greenhouse my favourite Scene. I get though there were some things they should of done like explain more and maybe it would of been a better Idea not to add the scene where Hodge and Valentine plot to pretend Clary and Jace are siblings. The Dialog needs to be a little better but i loved it! This Movie is great for Boys and Girls there Action,Fantasy,Comedy and Romance. The effects are superb and the acting is perfect! People complain about Jamie playing Jace but i think he was perfect he needs to toughen up a bit, that's all i ask.A must see Movie totally worth it, depends on the Person but Loved it. There must be a Sequel to tighten the loose ends have some Clary & Jace Action. I will Die with out the Sequel, even though i haven't read the Book this was my favourite Movie this Year!",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
406,igotnopeasant,Very similar to the book!,7,6 September 2013,"I read Cassandra Clare's young adult novel ""City of Bones,"" the first in the Mortal Instruments series, a year and a half ago. When I found out it was finally being made into a movie, I was very excited! I really liked first three books in the series, even if her later books left me dissatisfied. My dad and I made plans to see the movie together long before it was released. This past weekend found us in a near-empty theater, trying to ignore the sound of a rogue cricket, watching ""The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones.""The series centers on Clary Fray, a fifteen-year-old girl who lives with her mother in New York. Clary thinks she's a typical teenager, but that quickly changes when she and her friend Simon go to a nightclub and Clary witnesses a murder. The problem is that no one else seems to realize anything has happened. Just when she thinks she's going crazy, Clary's mother disappears from their apartment, and a demon nearly kills Clary when she goes looking for her. It's then that she meets Jace, the boy Clary saw murdering someone in the club. He reveals he's a Shadowhunter, a special demon-fighting race she shouldn't be able to see. And Clary's mother was one, too.Thrown into a world she never knew existed Clary joins the search for the Mortal Cup, a sacred Shadowhunter relic her mother supposedly possessed. The truth about Clary's special powers is finally revealed, and nothing about her past life can ever be taken for granted again.I thought that the movie adaptation of the novel stuck very closely to the original story. I prefer to read a book before I see it made into a movie, and it was nice to be able to understand what was going on instead of paying to see something that might as well be another plot entirely. A large part of that was because it was easy to reconcile the actors on screen with the characters I'd read about in the book. Most of them did a very good job at bringing the voices from the book to life. However, I do think that someone other than Jamie Campbell Bower should have been cast as Jace, the Shadowhunter who becomes Clary's love interest. For someone who was supposed to be drop-dead gorgeous, Jace's odd angular features left a lot to be desired--not to mention that he, like all the Shadowhunters in the movie, was mysteriously British, which threw me off. Another character, the warlock Magnus Bane, was also poorly cast. Godfrey Gao, who played Magnus, delivered his lines in a way that made me think of wallpaper: flat, dry, and unappealing.For fans of Cassandra Clare's books, ""The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones"" is definitely worth seeing. The movie doesn't destroy the book as many adaptations do, and it's always enjoyable to see your favorite stories on the big screen. The movie is rated PG and it definitely caters to a younger audience. However, even my dad even dropped his usual film cynicism and admitted that he really enjoyed the movie. Teens and adults alike will find the movie pleasant and relatively painless-- with the exception of Jamie Campbell Bower's weird cheekbones.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
407,thompsonjharper,Not Terrible?,6,7 September 2013,"Alright; First review. My little sister, my mother and I went to see this today. Both huge fans of the books, I had heard a lot.The story didn't disappoint me, I understood the jist of what was happening and I could follow along (albeit a little too) easily. My main issue with the film as a whole was the Acting and the Dialogue.The acting didn't really seem all there, with the exceptions of Robert Sheehan and Lena Headey. I can't blame this all on the actors as it is a director's job to make sure they give the best performance possible. Lily Collins and Jamie Bower gave the most static and boring performances I've seen in a film in a long time. It brings the argument, ""Is a pretty face all it takes to be an actor,"" to a completely new level. The delivery of some lines was just boring and all of this misplaced emotion. I also understand the desire to stay true to the fans, which I'm seeing has about a 50/50 record so far, but cut the cheesy dialogue PLEASE. I realize your target audience is tweens to early 20's but for the love of god make something interesting, give people character development, story, emotion, power. My biggest issue doesn't lie with just this movie. In the world of acting, you have to earn your right to be on stage, or in a film. In musicals you have to earn your songs with your character or else you are literally just breaking out into song for no reason. A Kiss is no different. Earn the romance, don't just become a twosome of horny teenagers whose motivation is, ""This is the part where I stick my tongue in his mouth."" You are getting paid to do the job so many people try their entire lives to do, don't waste it.All in all the movie is fine. Just don't have high expectations.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
408,nia-790-949523,My advice: Go see it!,9,12 September 2013,"I saw the film and went surprised, much better than I was expecting. I really enjoyed the film.The film is based in the books, not is an adaptation, but kept the same concept. Noteworthy that the actors did a great job, has been very good the selection of actors. I love the storyline of this film. Very good effects and setting.The film is intended for a teenage audience and not so adolescent. They have eliminated certain things from the book that are childish, giving more maturity.The film has had some very harsh critics and after seeing the movie, I don't understand it. Luckily I ignored the bad critics and went to see the movie and I liked it.Great movie and waiting see the next part.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
409,kluhrman,My Thoughts,10,16 September 2013,"The Mortal Instruments: City Of Bones is one of the best movies I have ever seen. They captured the book into the movie perfectly and yes some things were different but otherwise the movie was amazing just like the book and I am looking forward to all the next movies! Lily Collins captured Clary amazingly, so did all the other actors Jamie Campbell Bower, Robert Sheehan and all the other actors played the roles amazingly. Me and my friend Sabrina will be fans of the book and movies forever and always, and we both hope to meet the actors one day because we have been so inspired by them. So all the people saying that they expected the movie to be better than what it truly is should please stop because the movie is the best it can be and it is an amazing movie. I'm extremely excited for movie 2 City Of Ashes and hope they will start filming soon <3 xx",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
410,callie_024,Definitely worth watching!,8,18 September 2013,"I'm a huge fan of the books but was a little apprehensive when I heard they were making a movie - they don't always come up to par! But I was presently surprised and ended up seeing it twice.Some of the casting was a little off to me at first, but everyone grew on me. I especially loved all the quirky comments made by Jace.The ending was very different from the books, but we will see how they tie that all together in the 2nd one - which hopefully gets produced since this movie has a bit of a rocky start.All in all, I really liked it and will be buying it as soon as it's released!

I just recently was able to go and view this movie in theaters. I was skeptical at first because movies always leaves some information out. Plus, it's never how I imagined the movie to be compared to the book. After watching the movie, I was very pleased with what they were able to do. Although I wish some things were different, I'm pretty content with what was brought to the table. Also, IT'S NO WHERE NEAR THE NEXT TWILIGHT! Sheesh...Twilight Saga vs. The Mortal Instruments...MORTAL INSTRUMENTS ALL THE WAY! This series is so much better than Twilight because The Mortal Instruments is action packed! So excited for City of Ashes to come out :)",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones

413,katie-aaronnamedme,A complete waste of a perfectly good afternoon,2,4 December 2013,"Being a passionate fan of the books I held the same expectations as many others as I sat down to get ready to watch this movie. It was these expectations and more that completely ruined this movie for me.For starters, it was completely different to the book. And hey, I get it, not all aspects of the book can be put into a movie, but at least follow the story line and the major sequence of events that happen within the book. Where was Parabatai? Where was the explanation on what shadow hunters are and do, and their important history? Where was Jace's family history towards the end of the movie? There were so many plot holes in the movie that I felt like I was trying to piece a puzzle together as I watched the movie, and these pieces were ultimately being extracted from my knowledge of the beloved book.The script was awful. It was as if it was cutting and pasting lines from the book where ever possible. The movie became a circumstance of ""okay so we're going to change this whole scene from the books! But let's add a line from the book to make it seem like we did our homework."" And that really is not the way a movie, that is going to be based on a book, should be written.The story line at most did not make sense. I think if I had not read the book this movie would not have made sense to me. The scenes were choppy and rushed. I felt like I couldn't follow the story. Okay, Clary is a shadow hunter, but how did we get from scene A to scene B? Please explain. There was absolutely no chemistry between any of the characters. Forget the Parabatai, a very important concept from the books that was COMPLETELY FORGOTTEN, but what about Luke and Clary? What about Jace and Clary? What about ANYONE and ANYONE? The most I could say in terms of chemistry is probably that Simon and Clary seemed decent, and Simon and Isabelle as well. They were literally passable on screen together.The acting was at times God awful. I can say for a fact that most of the cast are in reality quite good actors... so what happened? To be fair, Jamie Campbell Bower had many expectations placed on him when it was announced he was to play the brooding little arrogant shadow hunter with so much whit that he had many like me swooning after him. His acting was a little below average, however, and his deadpan recital of would-be-funny lines really ruined the potential of his character. Lily Collins was slightly better than Jamie in terms of portrayal of a character that is doomed to be clichéd and hated - a girl finding out her whole life is basically a lie is always really quite difficult to pass off without looking pathetic. She seemed to be able to do it without too much of the ultimate pathetic-ness, adding light to a doomed movie. The others - mainly those who played Alec, Magnus, Hodge, Luke and Isabelle - were about in the same ranks as these two.Having listed all that is negative of the City of Bones, there are but a few pieces of the movie that allowed me to give it a score of 2. Robert Sheehan and Johnathon Rhys Meyers seemed to prove that despite the movie they were placed in, they could still shine and show off their talent to, almost, the best of their ability. Given the script they had to work with, it is quite difficult to do so, but somehow they managed. DESPITE Sheehan's questionable accent.The effects were also on the upside. They were no Lord of the Rings or Marvel, but they managed to do the trick and add a realism to the demons that attacked the characters time and again - Which by the way didn't seem to be in the book? Am I missing something?Overall, the movie was a waste of my time and I would recommend those who loved the book like I did, or just love movies in general the way I do, to not watch the movie. If you are to do so anyway, walk in with extremely low expectations and remember to make fun of the pain you feel while watching it whenever you can.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones

It's one of my favorite sagas. Clary was a little weird and stupid, but I'm okey whit that because she eventually becomes amazing in the books... In the movie she is a drama teenager whit a gift how becomes in a drama teenager whit a gift. ¡GIRL, YOU LOST YOUR MOTHER! I know you can do it better.... & Jace, OMG Jace, He is AAAMAZING at the books, he's beautiful, strong and brave; In the movies he looks like he is a drug addict. He's not Jace. I was really excited to see the movies and it's sad because this movie was so horribly different from the book that it lost all of it's value. I have no more words. I am completely disappointed. That's all.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones

I went past my expectations, and Jaime Campbell Bower was fantastic as Jace Wayland. The demons were gross, and Lily Collins, I had my doubts if she could pull off Clary, but she delivered.

416,fanny_movies,Impulsive Storyline,6,12 October 2013,"The movie offered a new perspective to the world of the supernatural but the impulsive storyline and dialogue failed to pull it off. Most of the scenes in the movie were irrelevant or just not properly prepared. The 60 million dollars invested in the movie would have been better spent developing scenes and dialogue with more depth and piizzazz. The graphics and fight scenes were pretty elaborate but cannot be compared to movies like Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings and ""dare I say it"" Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief. The movie offered ideas that was simply brilliant, (SPOILER ALERT!!)like the use to music to expose a demon but the execution was, simply put ""awful"". My personal rating for the movie is 6.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
417,adityabaser,The only good thing about the movie was the trailer,3,13 October 2013,"After watching the trailer I thought this movie could be a good one time watch. I have not read the books however even with the plot line that they used in the film they could have done a lot more. The characters were all one dimensional, the acting was too one tree hill to be a fantasy movie, the dialogues were out of place - there was no flow to any conversation. Jace and Clary were trying to be Edward and Bella so hard everything else in the movie started to get affected. It lacked an overall flair that you need in movies of this genre. All in all extremely disappointed with the movie but based on this evidence I might just read the books.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
418,ss_veto,"Awful acting, awful turn points which don't make any sense.",1,13 October 2013,"I am so glad i did not go to the movie theaters to see such a big disappointment. Let me just begin with the acting.. I don't believe in the actors, they are doing such a horrendous job. Simon is the only O.K. actor, the rest of them should just stop acting. Seriously.Now comes the plot.. It is so badly written, all the turn points don't make sense at all..it made me stop halfway through the movie. I just could not bear to watch it anymore.Just to elaborate my statement with proof.. When Simon is taken by the vampires, and the others find him. He is strangled and cannot breathe,almost dead i guess. (I assume it is well an hour or something that he is there) Why the f is the first thing that he does after he is released from the wires /whatever say: ""They're not after me, but the cup?""I mean come on, shouldn't you at least try to breathe first? Or No, the director of this movie decided to shorten this up, and make it quick; therefore resulting in this nonsense.Also, everywhere where they are in danger, there suddenly comes something random to help them up. (when they are inside the vampire hideout there suddenly comes a pack of werewolves)And what the f is up with the lead role, Clary, backstabbing the werewolves? We get to know they are kind of allied before in the movie. Lastly; Anyone who even gives this above 5 stars must either be a book enthusiast who fails to look objectively on this movie, or somebody who does not look so deep /get so quickly annoyed on this horrible acting as me.To the director & Hollywood. Kindly do not let any of the people act in any movie again, besides Robert Sheehan. The acting was just beyond bad.Also the director failed to reflect this mysterious aspect which is apparent in the books, which kind of ruined this piece of garbage movie even more. I'm starting to wonder, if they just made this movie to make some cash.I am so happy i did not pay to go to the movie theaters to watch this garbage.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
419,jsantiago38-822-834053,It's excellent,9,20 October 2013,"Well i just have to say that the movie it's been underrated. The movie takes you quickly into action so for a fan of action movies, martial arts and the like this was a plus. I was thankful not to have to wait for too much to get story developed and get to the point, personally i started to watch this movie like half asleep but just after the scene in the disco it got me up until the end. To me it deserves a 9 and not a 10 just for a little error here and there but overall excellent movie if there is a sequel or they decide to continue developing the characters in another movie am in! My favorite quote was ""Well, you can go ahead and hang your head out of the car window if you feel like it."" Luke laughed. ""I'm a werewolf, not a golden retriever."" maybe because i own a golden retriever and he loves to hang the head out of the car.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
420,qpnov13,Jessica Postigo & not Cassandra??? SMH,3,20 October 2013,"If you haven't had the pleasure of reading Cassandra Clarke's series you may not see the absolute HORROR in this screen play written by rookie FIRST TIME writer Jessica Postigo. Every scene is out of place, and rushed from one setting to the next. For ex. (we are in the kitchen #monster#im a shadowhunter?#where's Simon?# Valentines my .....#and Jace is my ... the end.) I PROMISE you the only thing you will really enjoy is the effects and plot. I was completely mortified to read Cassandra had no hand in re-writing her own saga which is typical for authors i guess ""hunger games"" (cough). Was it all about the money? Did you sell out to Hollywood? The movie completely ignores key moments between the characters, and delivers no emotional content at all. It was a very dull watch. This movie has very little positives except for an amazing casting job. The acting was chipped away due to the rapid scenes which adds to further disgust leaving no time to connect with the lead characters. In conclusion horrible re write and less than decent watch. Sony Pictures congratulations on FOOLING the public. Sex sells so we will throw a pretty girl and handsome fellow on screen with a familiar not identical story line then watch the suckers eat it up!

421,habibaumardesai,Horrible/Disappointing/Don't watch,1,21 October 2013,"This film was full of crap. Nothing made sense, the scenes overlapped. If someone had not read the entire series they would have been clueless as to what the hell was happening during the film. The casting was rubbish, none of the actors could play their roles as said in the book. E.G, Jace Wayland/Morgenstern/Herondale., was supposed to be a cocky, big headed, egocentric boy GOOD LOOKING teenager, but in the film he was a total opposite, giving random smiles, and acting like a love struck teen. The beginning of the film was messed, in the book she draws pictures in the film she draws like a billion runes, during the scene in the film where Jace and Clary and Dorathea are supposed to be in the room, in the book Clary is supposed to go through the five dimensional door to Luke's house. Instead she WALKS there. Simon is supposed to turn into a rat in the hotel Durmot, Isabelle and Alec were supposed to back to the institute but instead end up coming to the hotel and Alec fights and kills when really he's supposed to be afraid and not have killed a thing. In conclusion just read the books. Ignore the film as it is a waste of two hours, does not make sense and the director needs a slap on the face with the entire series. Please for the sake of mankind and the shadow hunter world - WHO WOULD BE CLEARLY OFFENDED BY THE MOVIE - please we beg don't make a sequel or this review will be even longer. Thanks =) H&H",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
422,princesssophie20,One of the best films I have ever seen!!,10,22 October 2013,"I have read all the current TMI Books and completely fell in love with them!! The books and the film have some things in common, but it would be so boring if it didn't have a few changes. The cast of this film, I think, was a great choice for the film as most of the actors have had experience of Action in other films, which makes the film great to watch. Lots of people have been saying that this film is a copy-cat of Twilight which is the complete opposite of what I have to say. Twilight was for teenage girls/boys and younger, this amazing film is for everyone, with the adult humour which Twilight didn't have. The Mortal Instrumenst film is a must see film and you don't have to read the books to understand what is going on in the film, which makes me love it even more!

423,isa_michaud,Review of the movie vs Novel,7,3 October 2014,"I would give 7.5 if the option was available. I hope these comments are being read by the Production team in order to aim for improving their work for the rest of this sequel.1- Please stop forcing the actors to be so skinny! I know they must train a lot, but they look much healthier/attractive at their ""normal"" weight.2- I know things must be adapted in order to produce a movie vs what's in the novel, but please try to be as genuine as possible from the original storyline.3- 130 min is good, but it's way to condensed and fast paced. You should aim for 2h45 min (more or less).4- This story is not just for teens. Try to market to reach adults too.5- The movie script should be revised by Cassandra Clare and be modified if she suggest so, in order to avoid incongruous mistakes like this one : the scene where Clary stops time/demons in the basement of the institute.Who wrote that? I mean seriously... It's not in the novel and it's the most stupid thing I've seen in a long time! Who's dumb enough to leave demons behind without killing them all when you have a chance to? Shadowhunters specializes in killing demons and winning battles. The ONLY way this scene should go is, once the demons were frozen, they take this opportunity to kill them all.6- Magnus... His acting lacks : He does not feel like he's been alive for 800 years. And why isn't he wearing pants exactly??? He's supposed to be eccentric, not weird. That was of bad taste.To resume, there is big potential for this franchise if you make the right decisions. Try to aim for Harry Potter or Hunger Games quality.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones

Because of how i felt about the movie I read the books right after i watched the movie and as always the books are without a doubt better. However i do still think they did an excellent job with the movie. What people have to remember that if they did the movie exactly like the book it would be over 4 hours long. So they did what they could. Brava. Most might not agree with me saying the movie is good but i think it that its worth seeing. I do truly hope they make a second movie. I would very much like to see it! In the movie they used some of the hilarious lines from the book which made it that much better! I regret nothing!",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
425,rehma_345,Disappointing... :/,7,10 November 2013,"To be honest this movie was how should i put this, okay to watch when you have absolutely nothing else to do. I watched the movie before I read the books but after i read the book I was utterly disappointed.-spoilers- the movie did not stay along the lines of the book. Most of the characters weren't even remotely the same as how their suppose to be not to mention the WHOLE SCRIPT WAS CHANGED. They added things in this movie that happens in the second book like how Clary creates a new rune. When i watched the movie before i read the book i imagined Clary being special but was confused half the time of what was going on._They didn't explain anything_ The end of the movie was the most disappointing, it was like they decided to just write there own ending. First off the Instityte is suppose to be a safe place for shadow hunters and nothing impure can enter (like vampires (seeing how the institute was part of a church) and DEMONS!!!!) the whole ending was suppose to be at RENWICKS where the portal is, not at the institute; when the portal shatters it was suppose to be stuck looking like the Wayland manor as Jace remembers and has a troubling thoughts about his father which continues in the second book.I don't know how they could've made this movie worse. As far as the second movie is concerned they should higher a new directer and make the movie like the book. readers want to watch the visualizing of what they read on the screen and not be disappointed in seeing the book they spent time reading turn into a totally different movie *the book was worth reading if you like fantasy, drama, and adventure*",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
426,slothscribe,I wanted more action,5,18 November 2013,"I gotta say, I expected more. Maybe it's because I've already read the book (and the whole series) before I watched the movie so I anticipated every scene, but, after the movie, I ended up thinking, ""Wow, that was short.""I don't know why. Most of the scenes I liked were in the movie, but they fell short of my expectations (as what could normally happen when you translate a book into a movie, so don't hate on me). I guess while I was reading the book, I had this image of an action movie in my head. The movie's fight scenes were great, but I wanted more. Also, Jace didn't seem that angsty to me (don't get me wrong, I think Jamie Bower is the one and only Jace, but I missed the narcissistic side of Jace in the movie). Does someone out there feel the same way?On a positive note, there were a lot of scenes that made my heart pound. The fight scenes were good (though they could have been better). Lily Collins' acting was great. Magnus' portrayal blew me away (I am officially a Gao fan *squeeaal*). As I said, the fight scenes were great.Most importantly, the way they handled the brother-sister ending was really classy. There was still a touch of uncertainty in the whole thing of whether they really are brother or sister (if you haven't read the sequel books). After all, in the movie, it was only Valentine who said they were siblings. Even though there was a shot of Jocelyn holding a box with JC on it, only Jocelyn can be the one to confirm the truth (and she was unconscious for the most part of the movie).All in all, even if one hasn't read the books, the ending, instead of disgusting the viewer, makes one curious to know how everything would play out. I for one would wait in anticipation for the next movie (I think it has been confirmed that the next one would be made).Of course, that's just me, other might think differently. What do you think of the movie",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
427,sdtolli,Series Fan NOT AMUSED!!!!,3,30 November 2013,"Let me start off by saying that I am a HUGE fan of the Mortal Instruments series (as well as the other series Cassandra Clare has written). I was super stoked to go see the first book come to life. For months I followed the production and harassed my best friend (on a daily basis) with new developments, so imagine my disappointment when this movie did not follow the book AT ALL!!!! There were some less significant aspects that the movie had accomplished to bring to life such as the settings. It was really great to see the institute come to life just as I imagined it would look like while reading the books. I have to say that this was 1 of the 2 only saving graces that compelled me to give this movie a 3/10. The other saving grace was Jamie Campbell Bower. At first I read a lot of criticism from fans as to how JCB was not physically Jace. I tended to agree to this but after seeing JCB in his other movies I knew he could pull the personality off. He was witty, charismatic and even at times physically reminded me of the Jace in the book. I believe that he rocked this character. This is as far as the positives in this movie...On to the negatives; the rest of the characters were not what I expected. I'm not the type to dwell on physical similarities btwn a book character and the actor(ess) because I know that it's not all about the looks being pulled off, but the choices made for these characters were awful. Acting wise they did not bring these characters to life. I LOVE Jonathan Rhys Meyers but he was a terrible Valentine. Clary had the same expression most of the movie (Kstew in Twilight??), Robert did not do Simon justice at all and Jemina did not show Isabel to be the strong loyal character described in the book. I'm not sure if this is all the actors faults or the producers, but I hope for the sake of City of Ashes something is done.I felt that overall this movie jumped between books 1-3; was completely out of order; important parts in the books were left out and some nonsense scenes were inserted that made NO SENSE to the movie or the overall series storyline.I was truly surprised that Cassandra Clare allowed this to happen. I cannot imagine that she sat back, watched the pre-screening and said ""Yes, this is my world brought to life."" I really hope that City of Ashes somewhat redeems City of Bones because if COA is just as bad, I have to call it quits with the movies; I cannot allow my book series to be tainted anymore.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
428,dolce-vita818,Disappointing,4,3 December 2013,"I needed a book series to keep me entertained over the summer, and hearing that this was being made into a movie I thought I may as well check it out. Now, I'm in my mid-20's and probably not the audience this book was intended for, but I still found the series enjoyable and easy to read, although it was a strange mish-mash of Twilight and Harry Potter at times. Also, if you're a fan of anything supernatural (demons, vampires, Sam and Dean) you'll at least have something interesting to pass the time with. That being said, I was looking forward to this movie. I should have known better after seeing what movie producers have done to other smaller novels or series (aka non HP block busters). It was just thrown together to make money. None of the characters have any chemistry. At least Lily Collins looks the part of Clary. Poor Jamie Campbell Bower looks like a malnourished runway model, hardly a warrior. I don't know if it was the fault of the director or the actor, but the personality of the character was all wrong and half of the sarcastic/cocky lines were delivered straight, which just made it confusing. All other characters were very hard to get invested in, which is sad because Lena Headey is great in Game of Thrones!As for the story line, if you haven't read the books or some sort of plot summary, don't bother. My poor friend got dragged to see this with me and was in a state of confusion the whole time. Too many unexplained parts of the plot to be able to enjoy the story. And as for book readers, prepare to be frustrated at the way the studio tried to dumb down the plot (notably with the Jace/Clary dilemma), as they spoil one of the major series plot twists right in the first movie.The worst part was that I was actually embarrassed watching some of the romance scenes. Embarrassed for the actors who clearly had no compatibility and even more embarrassed at the cheesy manufactured music and cinematography. I'm embarrassed now, just thinking about it.Anyways, don't go out of your way to watch this and definitely do not get your hopes up if you're a fan. I can't even say that I'm looking forward to the next films... that is, if they don't end up going the way of The Golden Compass...",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
429,delightedtobe,could have been so so much better,2,27 December 2013,"Utterly crap! The amazing abilities displayed by Nephilim and Downworlder alike never make it to screen. Jace looks like a starving heroin addict, hardly the picture of health constantly described in the books. The story has been chopped up and changed, should be described as based on a book we read once and tried to remember years later. I see the director is going on a mass murderous rampage with a sequel to come, please for gods sake, could somebody please feed Jamie Bower something and introduce him to a dumbbell! To Cassandra Clare, you have created an absolutely amazing story, so much better than twilight and ilk but please can we tame down the teenage sexual angst a little, bit overkill in the latest book.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
430,nikki_kitty_catt,I don't even know,4,3 January 2014,"I absolutely love the novels by Cassandra Clare like they are my all time favorite books. I know that when books are turned into movies they often don't turn out right but most do not change the entire plot when they are produced. I was so disappointed with how this movie turned out. It is a good movie but completely different than the book. The writers changed and rearranged so many details and the plot that is hardly the same anymore. Key details were altered like the runes aren't even drawn out by the characters all they do are touch the skin with the stele and Isabelle doesn't have the big ruby necklace. The plot was completely altered like how Valentine does not have the cup in the end of the movie (how is the next movie gonna work since in the book he has it) and the huge fight scene with Doretha isn't near the same with Simon not killing the greater demon. They completely added in the scene at the institute and changed huge details around that moment like the location and portal. The characters are also different like with Mangus being less pompous, Clary being less headstrong and more dramatic, Alec being more off a killer, Isabelle nicer but less prideful, and Jace is way less egotistical and cocky then he should be. Valentine is entirely different with his hair and they changed his past without mentioning the Circle and embellishing his mixing with the dark arts. Oh my goodness how they portrayed Bangborn and Blackwell with their attitude and actions toward Luke which are completely uncalled for.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones

I watched the movie later that night and picked up my books that night. I loved the movie though if I would of read the books first I would have been annoyed beyond relief with the movie! So I see why everyone is upset with it! Though I still can not wait for the second one to see if they can pull it back closer to the books and show the magic that the books have to a tee. I read all five books in less then a week! They where amazing!!! I can't wait for the next books(hopefully) and the second movie to come out!!!

The books were great- thoroughly enjoyable reads, I can't wait for May 2014 when the final book is out.I don't mind shortening sequences for movies ala Harry Potter and Hunger Games, but the entire plot is different from the books without any reason.The characters (particularly Jace- although he wasn't bulky/bronze enough from my imaginings) had the potential to be decent but weren't given enough time to develop their characters. It would have been better for this first movie to be all character development with a little action at the end like the book. Then I could have looked forward to the action in the subsequent movies.One of the major plot twists from the book was handled poorly in the movie as well which was really disappointing. (I don't think this is really a spoiler but I don't wanna get blacklisted so I put the warning up anyway). It was this twist that made the books so un-put-downable. I'm disappointed that the movies won't have that same element of suspense making the viewers wanting more from movie to movie.Overall, suggest reading the books and using your imagination. I'd skip the movie. :(",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
433,mssoheil88-896-571307,my thought on the movie,5,13 January 2014,the film was a good movie for someone that didn't read the book. they changed the story completely for example in the book it didn't mention about Clary's mother taking the poison and Clary didn't kill the demon with fire but with Jace's detector and Simon turned to a rat and the vampires didn't want the cup. they just thought that Simon was their pet and also Isable and Alec didn't go to the hotel. oh and Simmon was the one that defeated Dorothea the demon. and the biggest change was that in the book the portal and Valentine were in an abandoned island and Valentine didn't fight Clary and Jace cause He loved them and also Hodge didn't close the door to hell which there wasn't any door in the book. so they changed about 50 percent of the book.I think that it would be better if instead of a movie they made a series cause in one movie it is impossible to cover all of the story(just like the last part of Harry Potter)so I think without these changes it would be difficult to be able to make one movie.,The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
434,clharper4,Found this movie very entertaining,8,16 January 2014,"As I am not familiar with the books, I was able to appreciate the movie as I found it. I found it to be very entertaining, made me jump a couple of times, laugh out loud a few times and enjoy the storyline over all. I would watch the next but will hold off reading the books, I think. While the story was a little thin and this viewer's active imagination had to fill in more of the back story, there is only so much can be fit into 125 minutes of movie time. I did not find Clary overly dramatic, just compressed emotion that would've occurred over a longer period perhaps, I did find the character of Jase to be contradictory and inconsistent. The other characters were interesting, especially Isabella's snake whip. Like to know that story. Both Isabella and her brother were thinly drawn. Overall, I found it enjoyable enough to watch twice.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
435,Ngs2512,Not bad,6,16 January 2014,"The movie was not too bad, it was too short so didn't really have an opportunity to explain the story. The biggest grip I have is they changed the story FAR too much, such as when they meet valentine at the end, clay is suppose to have bright red hair valentine white, to name a few, Far too many for me to right here. Books r always better even twilight was but it keep the story just omitted or reduced some parts, this movie basically re wrote the flow of the real story, and added things not in the book, eg Clary & jace did not fight the bad shadowhunters to help Luke. I would like movies of all books inc the infernal instruments series, but they have to tell the story as close to the book as possible or it loses all the charm that made the story great To sum up, it's enjoyable, not enough action for those who had not read book & to far from the story for those who have. I will say that this movie like twilight actually caused me to want to read the books as I wanted answers to a questions left from the movie. Let's hope more movies learn from mistakes made in the first, it can be great if done right",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
436,Hayleeblackxoxo1,Intriguing,8,17 January 2014,"I had watched the movie before I had read the book although I had read the book after the movie it was still interesting and entertaining, I prefer to watch a movie with an opened mind, just like reading a book.When I had finished the movie and had waited a whole month to read the book to my surprise I kept thinking back to the movie at some points. Although with some parts in the book I would have loved to see implemented into the movie, and I can not wait till I see the next movie (I haven't read the book yet) I'm kind of eager.So moral of what I'm saying is that no matter what you choose to do first (read the book or watch the movie) they have their own pull, into each (the movie or book)",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
437,hjamiesonhenry,Do not watch!!!!!!,3,6 August 2014,"The characters are completely wrong compared to the book and there is no attention to detail or anything remotely like the book terrible actors the characters needs to be redone. Some parts were good but most was just a ripoff and is not worth watching they have thrown the book in a fire and started from scratch. A good actor for Jocelyn would be Rachelle Lefevre from under the dome. Jace looks like Sebastian from the later books! None of the Shadowhunters have a basic toughness about them and the demons are not very ""demony"" Isabelle looks absolutely awful too old and doesn't let you imagine her from the book and Alec is way to old for his part, Clary has no strength or athleticism and her actor dosen't suit this movie. They have ruined the entire book.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones

It's totally different, the writing is appalling and the casting is horrific, almost as bad the attempt at an Eragon film, and that was bad. I know the films are almost never as good as the book they're adapted from but I couldn't even bring myself to finish watching this. I could make a better version with my phone camera and a few Barbie dolls. I'm not sure why people are taking books that have the potential to be a great movie and producing this rubbish.Really disappointed.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
439,akesler1,Stop bitchin people...,7,28 January 2014,"First of lemme just say that I LOVED this movie. Was I completely 100% satisfied no I wasn't. But it was good enough for me to watch it three times in one day so I'd say that's a damn good movie.I wasn't even aware that this was out in theaters...or maybe I was and had no idea what it really was. When I saw the commercials for this coming out on DVD I was basically attracted to it because of all the Jace/Clary scenes. I'm a sucker for romance what can I say. I had no idea that it was a book series nor had I read any of the books prior so I probably went into seeing this movie with less hopes than those of you who read the books. But I loved this movie! I really did. I think the commercials (like they always do) distorted what the movie is actually about but I still loved it. and CANNOT wait for the next movie to come out...and if it doesn't I'll cry.For all of you complaining that it was a flop. All I can say is SO WAS THE FIRST TWILIGHT MOVIE! Number one they probably didn't have much of a budget and number two they probably didn't throw all they could into the movie because they didn't know how it was going to turn out! But I think it did it's job. Now after reading the books, and yes this movie motivated me to track down and read ALL the mortal instruments books out so far, I do believe they mis casted some of the characters. For example JRM as Valentine...uhm no that is not AT ALL who they described in the book. He has the right attitude but when I read the books and try to picture him in that position it just doesn't work. Also the girl they cast as Isabelle, while she is pretty I pictured someone much prettier. She's supposed to be drop dead gorgeous not simply pretty.All in all, like I said it's a great movie as long as you don't go into it with huge expectations. I think that with more of a budget and I'm sure now more of an audience the second movie will do much better. I really hope they go through with the second movie since it IS a series and it'd be a bummer if they let it flop like the other series movies like Series of Unfortunate Events and Spiderwick Chronicles. This series is great and deserves a sequel!!!!!",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
440,xmonster-munchx,"Needs Improvement, But Definitely Not Bad",8,29 January 2014,"In honour of the DVD coming out, I have decided to write my first IMDBb review. The Mortal Instrument: City of Bones is based of a book of the same name by Cassandra Clare. It focuses around a teenager called Clary Fray, whose mother gets kidnapped. She turns to a group of Shadowhunters, who hunt demons, to get her back.I'll first start with the casting; I wasn't impressed with it too much at first. Jamie Campbell Bower was not who I pictured as Jace Wayland at all, and was afraid he would ruin the whole movie for me, however, I was actually quite impressed with his performance. Lily Collins portrayed Clary wonderfully, as did Kevin Zegers and Jemima West as Alec and Isabelle Lightwood. The actual film would be generally satisfying to the teenage girl audience, such as myself, if you had never read the books. However, if you are a fan of the books, you will realise that it doesn't quite stick to the books at all. The general plot remains the same, but a LOT of detail were missed out, for example, the rat (people who have read the books will understand). The film was fast-paced, and wasn't boring at all, which I also loved. There was plenty of humour, and the whole cinema was laughing at certain points. The emotional aspect was spot on - I really did feel for the characters as much as I did while reading the book.The soundtrack and score was probably my favourite things about the film. I listened to it non-stop for almost a month after leaving the cinema. I give the film an 8 out of 10. There is still lots of room for improvement (AND A LOT OF BOOK READING TO DO FOR THE CREW) but I enjoyed the film, so an 8 seems appropriate.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
441,a_bre47,Overall a good movie!,9,7 February 2014,"Of course when it comes to book-to-film adaptations there are always a risk. Sure 'City of Bones' didn't perform as well in the box office as expected, but that doesn't mean it's a bad series. Hopefully for 'City of Ashes' they will fix what went wrong so that this film series can perform to it's full potential that I know it can have. Constantin sounds like they are very committed to continuing this franchise, which I am extremely happy about since I have been a fan of the books since 2009. I have faith that 'City of Ashes' will be better and that 'The Mortal Instruments' franchise can grow to be a majorly successful film franchise such as 'The Hunger Games' and 'Twilight', personally I think it is WAY better than THG. Just give 'City of Bones' a chance, don't watch the movie thinking ""Oh this is another Twilight."" because it's NOT. They are TWO DIFFERENT SERIES. :)",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
442,n-deschryver,Such harsh critics!,10,1 February 2014,"Although they had to cut out a lot of things from the book (like every movie based off a book does!) I thought the movie was wonderful! I finally got to see everything my imagination put together and I wasn't disappointed. You also have to consider that the first movie always has a low budget to work with just like twilight did. I really hope they continue to make the rest of the movies and I can't wait to see them! Also, I thought the actors were really great and one thing I noticed throughout the whole movie is that Lily Collins wasn't afraid to get dirty when she was suppose to. It just bugs me how in some movies the female can be dragged all over the place and her clothes and skin don't have a speck of dirt on them because they are trying to be beautiful all the time. I think Lily Collins is going to go far and her eyebrows aren't that bad, you get used to them and they are kinda her trademark.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
443,Yenschloe,"Bad, oh so bad!",1,3 February 2014,"Seriously this movie was the worst! I am a fan of the books but this was horrible! The movie brought in so many details from the other books in the series... And forgot to explain some of the basics. Isabelle was supposed to be a no nonsense girl who is rough around the edges, what happened?! Simon, your character was incredibly different from the book. The entire first 30 minutes of the movie confused me and all out of order, what was the purpose of that? It didn't add anything and did not help those that had not read the series understand what was happening. The ending...seriously I am not sure what happened here. This was so far off the book that I was left stunned. Bad casting (Jocelyn was just like I pictured her, Simon too! No one else. Jace casting was way off of the description in the books), bad acting, bad/incomplete storyline, etc. I would not suggest anyone watch this or bother with the sequel! If you want a good story, read the books!",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
444,chuface,"Disappointing! Could be better, still have hope!",3,5 February 2014,"I begun to read the books when the film released, I decided to read the books before I watch the film. And what can I say after 6 months when I have read all the books, I decided to sit down and watch the film.I love the books, as many other fans did. But the film is a whole new level of disappointment. Why do I say this, because I believe this film was RUSHED! This collection of books were 1000 times better than Twilight!(I did not even watch the films!) It had a promising future, with the characters and the story.The reason why I say this film was RUSHED because, I felt as a audience member, the film was just jumping to the events, there was no build up. It just jumped to event after another event with no link what so ever. If could have been better connected and developed.There was no introduction to the Vampires, which I believe played a significant part in the books, I understand that they can't fit much in. However to Simon's character and his future within the books they play a significant part. Really disappointed about the development of Simon's character, he was well played Robert Sheehan. However he just magically doesn't need his glasses any more, I actually don't know what he is, Vampire or Mundane?? (Unclear, because he can just walk around in the day.) The characters had no chemistry! NO CHEMISTRY at all! The relationship between Isabelle and Clary what was that? Nothing, absolutely nothing there. They really have to develop the characters more, the actors and actresses need to study the characters and understand the nature of their characters. Jonathan Ryhs Meyers poor choice of Valentine! Really could not stand his acting. Valentine a calculating, manipulative evil villain and I did not see a speck of that in his acting.Jamie Campbell Bower looked the part to be Jace, I don't believe he played it well, especially the part when he found that his father is Valentine. Clary sigh... she was too dramatic, could of been better! Let's get to the part that I enjoyed the most beside the bad acting the lack of chemistry or the missing significant events. I must say the effects and settings that it was filmed in was the best. I say this because they got it spot on with City of Bones, wow it was incredible, for me, it would have looked something like that in my imagination. Also the institute part, when Clary sees what's behind the glamour. My favourite parts of the film, because I pictured it to be similar. Very impress, plus the CGI effect, the costume/makeup of the demons, made it look very real. The ending of the films could have been better staged however overall film is okay.I won't give up on this franchise yet, looking forward to second film and the last book!",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
445,wendydiane85,Good film,8,10 February 2014,"I am a HUGE fan of the books and i am always disappointed when they get made into movies. This was however a good representation. i can see why some things were changed as the first book as a lot of information in it, setting the scene, introducing the characters and so on... I don't like that in the movie one of the main portals was in the institute as that wasn't in the book but it made some transitions easier i can see why they changed it. I do think that the 2nd movie will show more of the character relationships. You have a much deeper understanding of Clary's and Jace's love in the books that the film doesn't do justice if i'm honest. I do think that they cast the characters very well. I read the books before the film came out and Magnus Bane, Simon and Jace are spot on. Exactly what i imagined in my head!This is a good watch if you like magical movies with a good love story. I think it's better than Twilight and holds the imagination like the Harry potter films did but i guess not everyone will love it like i do.Very much looking forward the the City of Ashes!",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
446,roisinrloughran,Great movie,10,15 February 2014,"It was an awesome movie and wish I had have read the books but I will in the near future. I loved all the twilight books and movies and I can say this movie has definitely won me over, enough to say that I think it even beats the twilight movies. It has romance, love rivals and on top of that, great fighting action that keeps you clued from start to finish. I have watched it so many times now, CD and books have been ordered, I only hope they make the next movie and very swiftly. I think they did an awesome job and the actors/actresses played their roles with great enthusiasm. You can't just make one movie and not the rest so please continue to make the second and hopefully the rest.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
447,Dazelme24,Absolutely nothing like the book!,7,18 February 2014,"Honestly, this movie would be great if you aren't a fan of the book. The only similarities is the characters names! Even the first scene was wrong! City of Bones: Chapter 1 page 1, Clary and Simon are waiting in line to get into the Pandemonium Club IN COSTUME. But of course, in the movie it starts out at the poetry reading. The Pandemonium Club is the FIRST PLACE she meets Jace, Alec, and Izzy. She repeats this multiple times throughout the series. Also, the battle between Jace, Clary, and Valentine takes place at an old hospital called Renwicks, and there's no Portal at the Institute, to name a few differences. But this movie, in my opinion, had pretty good actors and acting, and Jace and Clary's relationship was displayed quite well. Like I said above, if you haven't read the books, or aren't a major fan of the books, this movie would be great to watch for fun or with friends.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
448,clarissaday3107,Better than the book? Not by far!,8,21 February 2014,"Having read the book of the City of Bones, along with the entire Mortal Instruments series I suppose I am at a disadvantage to the fact I already know what is coming. However, having read the book I know what the story is supposed to be; how the characters should be acting. First let's start with characters. When the actors were announced Jace was disappointing. The image that Cassandra Clare portrays is a bad-ass, sarcastic, hot guy. And I'm sorry to say that when Jamie Campbell Bower was announced he just didn't look right. But I have never been more wrong! He was perfect in the role of Jace, with his witty remarks and the looks he gives Lily (Clary) fit perfectly with the book. Their chemistry is clear when they are together let's hope this continues for any future endeavours. The rest of cast was average at best sometimes, Jemima West looks the part, but her acting leaves something to be desired. A special mention is needed for Robert Sheehan, the role of Simon has been changed from the book however, he plays the love-sick teenage boy that we have all known at one time perfectly. He's funny with his witty remarks and shows us what acting really is! Now for the story, I may be bias in having read the books but the story has been altered. This of course is normal when adapting to the big screen from a book. However, the fact (and I won't ruin for the people who haven't seen the film or read the books) the film ruins the whole big plot line for the next few books really grinds me! Some parts they have changed for no apparent reason at all. Overall, the story is the same Clary finds out she is not a mundane and is introduced into a world of demons, angels and shadowhunters. Her mother having hid all this from her till now means it is a huge shock to Clary's system. The story is full of action, romance and fantasy at it's best. This has been an average adaption from book to big screen. It's not the worst adaption that has hit the screen but it still leaves much to be desired. Unfortunately, it has been overlooked by many due to the bad reviews many have given it. This film is definitely worth a try! It's not too sappy that men would refuse to watch, and yet there's not too much action that it puts the women off either. It does have good points and I would definitely suggest you go watch it; it's a good film to relax with and watch the night away. As long you don't pay too much attention the acting! I've voted it an 8/10 it would have been a nine had they not revealed the big plot line in the film. Its definitely watchable but could have been better!",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
449,nuno-rodrigues1509,Great movie,9,28 February 2014,"It is really difficult to explain why the big gap between reviews, some people just give a 1 to the movie and other give it a 9 or a 10.In my opinion, to enjoy this movie you must be in right mood, you must be in a mood of watching a brand new story with young actors that did their best to provide a decent performance. The story is likable and the action on the movie is good. I understand that some specific details are not explain on the movie but i believe that the sequence will show us much more. Great soundtrack, same as in ""Sunshine"" (Great movie also).I give it a 9 because not because is a Oscar movie but because it is a great tentative and effort from a set of young actors.

So, of course, they had to leave a lot out when they turned it into a movie. I don't like how a few parts stray completely off from the book. The actors looked fantastic, but i thought they had some pretty lame acting skills. It kind of felt like they had to speed everything up to get the whole story in there. The first, crucial part of the movie was rushed, and didn't set the rest of it up as nicely as it could have. The romantic aspect of the movie was rushed also. That escalated way too fast. There was just too much to cover to put that whole book into that small of a movie.

Leave your brains if watching this movies.Its like the stupid twilight series with trying to attach more action and stuff but miserably failing.I have watched a few thousand movies and never written a review; but this movie has forced me to save the un suspecting.If possible i would give it a negative million rating.Some scenes are watchable and the young actress looks really hot in some, but thts about it and even that is not in abundance.Bottom line do any damn thing except watch this movie unless you have got both time and money to waste.

452,geragon-955-919828,A disappointed fan's review,4,5 October 2014,"My first time writing a review here on IMDb. This might contain spoilers, please be kind.Just like those who has written before me, I, too, am very disappointed at the casting. Jace looks nothing like what I imagined, Clary is not a redhead-- I imagined her as a redhead, not a brunette who dyed her hair-- Luke doesn't look rugged enough, and Simon doesn't look geeky enough. I'm sorry, but I imagined Isa as a fierce, arrogant looking, glam model with a jet black hair. What's with their fake British accent anyway? In my head, none of them has a British accent except Val.Also, did they even cared for the details? I am so very disappointed with the lack of details on everything. Clary's home didn't look homey enough, the stele-- the stick they use to draw runes with-- looks awfully designed. Let's not start on the runes. In the book, cmiiw, they were described as thin spider-web like and leaves very faint mark. What's with those ink splotches? They're not even that neatly drawn. Ah, let's not forget to mention Clary's house. I imagined it as an artist's house-- maybe some unfinished painting here and there, some stacks of sketchbooks and designs on the table... But maybe that's just me.In conclusion, this movie would have been better if they cared more about the details.

This will draw the charmed, Buffy and angel crowd for sure. This cast was such a great choice, granted Clary does have freckles and lily Collins doesn't but oh well. I think they work.

457,tuke1268-993-800268,60 million dollars for what?,3,1 November 2014,"Honestly this is one of the worst fantasy movies i have ever seen in my life. Who was the casting director who cast this leading lady? I am an artist myself and we do a lot more with WAAAAAAAY less. This is the problem with Hollywood. Too much money, too little real talent and thought into scripts. I mean come on. We write the stories for you and spoon feed material to you( ie marvel comics and a myriad of botched fantasy novel butcher jobs like this) but you still can't seem to breathe a soul or life into stories penned with pure creativity and imagination.Back to this leading lady. I rarely criticize other artist because i know how hard it is out there, but if you want to create another lifeless American cliché do yourselves a favor and spend say 60 bucks and not 60 million. No character development at all. I have never read the novels but i grew up on Lord of the Rings and Dungeons and Dragons. Thank God these movies weren't around to ruin my childhood. The back story was not really explained and as someone else said the whole crew as well as this holy grail cup thing just seemed like props to use in rouge gone to hell version of Buffy the vampire slayer minus the hot and somewhat talented lead. This is the definition of what is wrong with American movies. I mean this is one of the few things we do well in this country is make movies. All in all. Two hours of my life that i could have spent watching sap run down trees and felt like it wasn't a waste of my life force.

458,arp-eden,"Loved, disagree with all negative reviews.",10,21 May 2014,"Before I start I must state that THIS IS NOT TWILIGHT, personally I don't actually see the resemblance. Twilight is a romance film first, a action film second. This film is action first, romance second. Sure the events of the film do revolve around Jace's feelings, otherwise he would have just ignored Clary, however that only fuels the action. There are just a few references to romance (the greenhouse scene, the falling on him scene, and the one kiss) however these are all passed over quickly, and expected of any action film.I went into the film after not reading the books. (I in fact had started however they didn't interest me so I stopped.) I was a bit wary because I didn't think Jamie fit the role I expected, I was also wary because I disliked the beginning of the book. However I loved it. I believe Jamie played his roll perfectly, and although I wouldn't have placed him there he did the role justice and made me fall in love with Jace. There were some large problems with it obviously, as expected of a film adaption. For example in the book Simon got turned into a Rat before he was kidnapped. which does actually play a big part. There is the aspect of them not explaining exactly what the runes are. However I had never heard of them but I found it very easy to understand that they gave them abilities that they didn't previously have. I came out of the film and because of all the enigmas I couldn't wait to find out what happens and if they are really related etc etc. I ordered the books as soon as I got home. This time I loved them, and it really added to the film, I was able to enjoy the books more as the film gave me a understanding.Since then I have watched the film countless times, loved it more and more each time.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
459,buggymahone,Amazing,10,31 May 2014,"honestly I absolutely loved the movie and the books...although the movie was a little rushed for me I really enjoyed it and thought it was really amazing!I need the next one!I don't see why this movie wasn't popular. The whole book series is an extremely popular series. I hope the directors realize how many people actually enjoyed this movie and will start making the 2nd one. To me I felt like the movie followed along with series extremely well. What was the reasoning behind it being ""unpopular""? I would be extremely disappointed if they don't make a second movie because this one was one of my favorites. I really believe that a second movie would really make a lot of people happy.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
460,yassydk,Do not watch with high expectations...,5,8 June 2014,"I am a huge fan of the books series but I must say I was disappointed with the movie. You had to have read the books to understand the movie properly (which I guess they relied on), instead of newly explaining/introducing everyone to the Shadow Hunter world. It was cast well except for Alec, I love Kevin Zegers but he had the wrong physique(Alec is supposed to be tall & lanky) but mainly my problem was with Jamie Campbell as Jace, Jamie is actually a pretty good looking guy but in the movie he looks strange and they make all the angles funny, he also looks so uncomfortable, therefore making him incapable of pulling of Jace's lines..and Jace -in the books- is an extremely good looking, funny (snarky/sarcastic?)guy. Valentine is supposed to have silver white hair! Over all 5/10 will be interested to see if they make a second movie..",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
461,flyer224,I loved it!,10,25 June 2014,I've read the first 5 books and cannot wait to read the last one. I owned a video store for almost 20 years and had to watch tons of movies. My customers counted on me to make recommendations for them. I would have recommended Mortal Instruments many times over. I've watched it several times and have loved it each time. I don't know why they're holding off making the second movie. I'm anxious to watch how these characters evolve on the screen and hoping they'll do movies of the whole series. Hurry up before the actors are too old to play their parts. I really dislike when they change an actor who plays a major character in sequels. It ruins them.,The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
462,Bealikes,Love it!,10,22 July 2014,"I love this film , I'm an avid fan of the books and yes some bits are not in there but it was excellent, I think it could have caused the film to be very long if we put everything from the book in and it was spectacular and easily grasped regardless even for people new to the story and it's characters. I loved the cast choices despite many people disliking the jace actor! I think Jamie Campbell bower is perfect! And Lilly Collins was also well suited. I also loved robs portrayal of simon it's exactly how I would have expected him to be. I'm really hoping that they get the go ahead for book two city of ashes to begin production very soon as I'm exited to see it on screen. I really enjoyed this film !",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
463,swiss_alps01,Loved it!,9,13 August 2014,"Absolutely loved this film. Can not wait for the second installment. I know a lot of people don't agree with me however I thought that for the amount of information you needed to present from the book, the movie managed to do it without getting too confusing. It was face-paced, witty, enjoyable, and for a teen book turned movie, not bad at all. What more can you expect. I thought all the characters showed heart and especially enjoyed the darkness of Valentine, the romance between Jace and Clary, and the heart wrenching sadness of Simon (as well as his funny bits). Definitely worth a watch. BTW If you buy the DVD watch the roundtable chat with some of the main characters. Really endears you to them even more. Love it, love it, love and want more!",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
464,nerdbeauty1120,Best Movie/book EVER,10,23 August 2014,"I loved the books and the movie was amazing as well! All great actors, yes some of the book was cut out but not much. The CGI was well done, no Matrix but still very fair. The action scenes were simulating and exciting. My best friend, a harsh movie critic, absolutely LOVED the movie, loved the charterers, the story, everything. The plot was played out well, the only con I really see is the lack of chemistry between Jace and Clary, I mean yes they are portraying the characters well and the kissing scene was pretty good but I always imagined it a lot more intense and passionate and just fiery. It DEFINITELY deserves a second movie. PS: WAY BETTER THAN TWILIGHT ANY DAY, It's really nothing like Twilight putting aside the whole love triangle thing Stephenie Meyers had a good idea, but the movies ruined it. And let's not pretend like Stephenie Meyers started the while love triangle thing, it's been around for a while. So how about stop comparing 2 completely unrelated movies to each other, it's like comparing flip-flops to bacon!!!",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
465,ColtPixy,Liked it,7,2 September 2014,"I haven't read the book, but I liked the movie. It's not the best movie made, but it does have entertainment to it. Lily Collins is a very good actress and I think she is a good actress for the part of Clary Fray.I do have a interest for movies like this, so maybe I'm a bit biased about liking it. As I've said Lily Collins did a good job, but so did Jamie Cambell Bower and Robert Sheehan, both actors I've seen before and loved in their performances. It did take me awhile to recognize Aidain Turner, but I think that speaks about his acting skills or maybe he just change that much since I saw him in Being Human.I think I'll read the book, but I am going to do that because the film interested me in the series. Am I going to change my mind after reading the first book and the rest of the series, perhaps but for now I really liked the film.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
466,samanthacook100,Awesome movie,10,14 September 2014,"This is the best movie I have ever seen. It is very catchy and is a great story. It is great to watch it with your family or a friend maybe even with your boyfriend/girlfriend. It has a bit of romance, which makes the movie even more interesting. All of my friends have watched it and they have become obsessed with it. You can watch it about 100 times and it still never gets boring. The filming was very good and the actors played their roles fantastically. It is very well organized and makes you feel like you are in the story. I have read all the books and can't wait until they make the rest of the movies. Although is is not definite that they are going to make they other movies from the series but please make them. City of bones was breath taking you should defiantly watch it. Read the books, buy the movie and I promise you your world will change of how you look at things.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
467,psadams93,Could have been so awesome,3,16 September 2014,Movies like this give me a whole new appreciation for those involved with the Harry Potter movies. This movie was a giant spoiler for any following movies. Just felt rushed and like no one really cared about the story. Would have been a good movie with a great foundation for future films if they would have just slowed down and let certain things simmer in secrecy for a bit. Too much was revealed too soon. Random issues I had: Some of the actors let their own accents slip in every now and again which was distracting and Magnus Bane was no where near as playful and fabulous as he should have been. He was pretty irrelevant in this movie...A simple prop (As we're pretty much everyone but Clary and Jace). Jace needs to eat a few hamburgers.,The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
468,cabrera-118-721145,Never Read the Books but...,9,27 September 2014,"I am usually a stickler about reading the books first then watching the movies, but I didn't even know this was a book to be honest. I DO NOT think this is like Twilight at all. I think it gives the ""world of mythology"" a different point of view especially how it plays with the idea of angels and demons. I actually enjoyed this movie a lot and think the characters were well played, but then again without reading the book. I can understand if those that have read the book think differently. All in all though, I liked the plot, the characters, and the little details of this film. It kept me intrigued and wanting more. I have only just seen it because I do not have much time to go out to the movies, but I'm glad I rented it to watch. I would have gone to the movie to see it and not have felt ripped off. In perspective, those that read the Harry Potter or Twilight books usually have picky things about the film while those that haven't read 'em think for the most part that the movies are good. I think this is the case of this movie especially with the low ratings. Then again, it's only my opinion. I truly liked the romantic plot intertwined with the action and general plot of the books. I would recommend this movie if you're looking for something to watch.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
469,cmarqs84,I want my money back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1,10 October 2014,"This movie was the hugest flop I WILL EVER SEE in my life. I'm sad because, I have read every single book in the series and absolutely LOVED them. I was really looking forward to seeing the movie series, yet when I started seeing the cast starting feeling as if it was going to not live up to the books. How right I was, the whiplash from the bad transition from scene to scene, to the horrible setting up for the whole movie is truly disturbing. You left out soooo much from the book and everything about the movie is a disaster. I PRAY they highly consider a remake of the first film to make up for what they have done. I honestly seen this if produced, directed, and screen played corrected. Being as big as the Harry Potter Series. I will honestly tell you, Ill keep my money and wont even waste $1.50 to see it out the REDBOX.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
470,hum_diggy_dee,Had so much potential...,3,28 October 2014,"I am a fan of the book series and have read all of them, which I loved. Unlike the books, the film is uninteresting and corny. I was so excited to watch the film and even managed to convince my husband to watch it with me as he knew how much I loved the books. I found myself apologising to him throughout the entire film. Although I felt like the actors chosen for the roles were exceptional, so many just didn't perform well. I thought Lily Collins would make a good Clary but her weird half British/ half American accent really frustrated me as it kept changing throughout the film. Jamie Campbell- Bower acted exceptionally but the script made Jace and Clarys romance storyline incredibly cheesy. I understand with book to film franchises that some book content needs to be cut or changed slightly but I really feel like the book was not done justice at all. This has the potential to be a 6 film series and be as popular as the Hunger Games or Harry Potter. Instead it flopped and we fans were left disappointed.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
471,dahuruonye,The girl in this movie is hot as hell,4,22 December 2014,"The girls lips, eyes, thighs in that tight black dress and sexy ass hair made this movie what it was, a box office hit. During the beginning of the movie she didn't look that impressive because her looked bland in a ponytail, but as soon as she took that ponytail out and let her hair run wild like a stallion, the movies quality went up by one star.Towards the middle of the movie there were a lot of glamor shots of her walking around in a tight black dress with her hair bouncing up and down like she was advertising for a name brand hair shampoo commercial. The bouncing hair and her tight black dress moved the movies quality up ANOTHER star. Good job to whoever the director was for that.Now the end was when the director made sure there plenty of close ups of the girls juicy lips, i didn't even realize they were so full until towards the end. I gotta say, that's ANOOOOTHER star. Nice job director.Uh...there was some angst filled bad-boy blonde haired guy who carried like 18 knives on him, it was pretty cool to watch him fight. So for that, 1 more star. Giving this movie a total of 4 stars!So, in short: The girl was hot as hell, and the angst filled bad boy guy looked cool fighting zombies and stuff. I didn't care for the story at all, all i know is that there was a group of shadow hunters who hunted demons and they lived in the city. All i really cared about was who was going to get the girl at the end, the angst filled bad boy with 18 knives, or the hopeless romantic nice guy who likes to wait eons before he tells girls he's in love with them. I really wanted to see whether this movie was going to accurately portray the girls interest compared to real life love-triangle scenarios. But really the girl being hot was what ultimately kept me interested.You wanna watch a movie about magic and werewolves and stuff with a good story. My friend...you already know where to look! The harry potter series! That series has hot chicks AND a compelling story.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
472,mrs-j-markham13,Eh...,7,31 December 2014,"The movie isn't great. I wouldn't say that its better than many. As I explained it to my husband before the first time he saw it, it's a good time waster when there's nothing on TV, and you don't feel like doing anything else. It's not horrible though, so it's already better than Eragon. My approach to every book adapted movie is to take the movie for what it is, not what I think it should be according to the book, and that usually works out for me. A lot of people were right about there being no character development, no explanation on a lot of terms and items, and the characters just being kind of flat. But there was a lot of decent, though long winded, fight scenes, the cinematography itself was decent, and the casting was great. The actors just didn't have a lot to work with script wise. It could have been a lot better, yes, but it also could have been a lot worse. Should they make a sequel, maybe. Should they get better writers for the next one, if they do it, definitely. Should they re-do and go a different way with this one, if possible, yes.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
473,caitlinjessm,Amazing!,10,24 January 2015,"I absolutely loved this movie. I have read all the books, and sure, it doesn't get everything right, but no-one is perfect and I think this movie was great! I would definitely recommend it! This is an amazing movie, there's amazing stage combat, fantastic lighting, and the actors are all great. The music really adds to it as well, causing the feelings to really get across, this is my favourite movie with the perfect cast for it. There is really no other way to say it, it's the best movie I've ever seen, a great book-to-movie adaption, and in my opinion, doesn't deserve any hate for anything, especially not following the book, seeing as it does for the most part, and movie is can't include thought tracks properly, and it wouldn't have been able to have been made if it was a lot longer, as it would cost too much money.Therefore they had to cut out a lot of scenes from the book, and maybe could not but out other places for the movie like Renwicks as they were on a tight budget. The cast did a great job, and for all those out there who say that there was no implication that Alec was gay (little spoiler) he did tell her to stay away from him, and reminded Jace that the rune to fix a broken heart is the most painful one, also the way that he looked quite shocked and embarrassed when Magnus said that he was the hot one out of the group. Lily Collins played a great Clary, she was definitely who I would have given the roll. A lot of people say she was just asked to do it for the money grab, but I disagree strongly, as she is a great actress. Jamie Campbell Bower looks exactly how I always envisioned Jace, he has the hair, the wit, the style, and plays the role exceedingly well with amazing stage combat skills. Kevin Zegers did a great job as Alec, he got the point across all the way through the film that he and Jace were extremely close, closer than brothers but also that he was protective over Jace. Jemima West definitely got the beauty and words of Isabelle across to the screen, showing that girls are stronger than a lot of people give us credit for, and is an amazing actress, a great choice for the role. Robert Sheehan played Simon extremely well as a brave person who is so sweet and kind. He's a great actor. Jonathan Rhys Meyers plays a great Valentine, definitely gets across that he wants to rule, and that he believes loving makes you weak. He's a great actor and amazing in stage combat, just like JCB. Lena Headey plays a great Jocelyn, and gets across extremely well that she is trying to keep Clary safe, with a lot of love for her daughter and her obstinacy against giving in. Aidan Turner plays Luke, and he does a good job of it. He is a good actor and shows that he cares for Clary and Jocelyn. Godfrey Gao played Magnus quite well, he didn't have a lot to say, and showed very well that Magnus is gay. He showed that he was a powerful person. Jared Harris played a very good Hodge, he got the right sort of voice that I had imagined, very wise. All in all I think the cast was a great choice for it; Iwould have liked the film a bit more if it had followed more of the speech from the book, but it was still an amazing film, with great lighting, good camera shots and awesome stage combat. The acting was well co- ordinated, and the lighting often either reflected or contrasted the scene to give more of an impact.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
474,taymardiv,I watched the movie first. After reading the books... Big mistake,5,24 January 2015,"I bought the books for my mom a few years back and never bothered to read them myself. Fairies and warlocks really aren't my thing.Scrolling through channels late one night, I saw the title and recognized it. With nothing else on, heck, why not? I missed the first minute or two, no big deal. It took a little to get into the movie, but I really liked it. With knowing nothing, the acting was okay. Reminded me a bit of Twilight. Watching the movie inspired me to dust off my mom's books and give them a shot.After reading the first book, which the movie is based off of, I was severely disappointed. Yes, I know, you can't fit every detail from the book into a movie. But oh man, I couldn't let the issues go. Valentine has white hair, make him have white hair! Isabell is suppose to have a red pendant, not a red stele. It is said in the book! And the prequel series lets you know why (I got really into the books and read The Infernal Devices, too). But my biggest issue is the ending. This is a series. When it's a series, that means there will be another one after.In the book, Valentine gets off with the cup. In the movie, Clary has the cup.VALENTINE IS SUPPOSE TO HAVE THE CUP!! It's the whole reason for the second book. Clary, Simon, and the Shadowhunters go after him for the cup!!Why has nobody else brought this up? It's kind of a big deal.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
475,Bonniemcgahalax,I Watch This For Nostalgia Purposes ONLY,4,22 September 2020,"I dove into Cassandra Clare's books when I was around 13. And let me tell you, I thought that this movie was great 7 years ago. I rewatched it, bought it on Amazon Prime, and watch it maybe once a year when life gets hard and I need that temporary fix of childhood warmth. With that being said, I just finished rewatching it out of curiosity. To sum it up: It feels like a parody of other, better-written YA novels.Let me explain where I think things went deeply and totally wrong.1) Clare clearly was under the impression that only fans would be seeing this movie. The first few times that I watched it, the books were still fresh on my mind so I understood all of the references. I knew why Simon was a Daywalker because I read the books. Because of the rushed pace, the movie didn't have enough time to explain these facts. After not having been in the Shadowhunters universe for so long, I forgot a lot of these facts. Thus, looking at it from a fresh perspective, it dawned on me just how confusing this film was to follow. In the book this is discussed in more depth, but in the movie it was a very out-of-left-field moment. I could go on, but I think that there's a more prominent example of this that leads me to my second point.2) There is no sequel. While this is more of a problem with the film's flop, Clare should have been able to anticipate that a good half of the audience probably hadn't read the books. And that leaves the viewers with the extremely disturbing ""fact"" that Clary and Jace are actually brother and sister... which in vague terms means that they are each in love with their own sibling. I don't fault Clare entirely on this, but it was a risky move that wound up not paying off. The fact that it was even included in the plot of the books made me uncomfortable enough, but leaving the movie at that? Even when I was 13 I had to constantly reassure my mom that, no, they're not ACTUALLY blood siblings. This did not make her feel less disgusted. It would be like if Clare stopped writing the story after City of Bones and the readers just had to sit with the knowledge that they were rooting for a couple that, to their knowledge, is biologically related. It's just an icky feeling.3) Lily Collins is an amazing actress. It hurts me so deeply to see her talents criminally underrepresented with this script. The script is predictable, cheesy, and cringey. Poor Jamie Campbell-Bower deserved better too. Jesus Christ, this was a loaded cast and even they couldn't sell the script because it was that god awful. I didn't care about a single character except for Simon, and even he has a nice-guy complex where he thinks that Clary owes him her love because he's nice to her and he's her best friend... which is a toxic trope.4) That kiss was a sin. I literally bursted out laughing. The rain that just spontaneously appears? That Demi Lovato song in the background? The cheesy lines? I laughed. I'm sorry Lily Collins, I love you. I know you're trying. But this was horrible.5) Lena Headey was the best thing about this movie.6) The CGI is terrible. The demons don't feel menacing. ALSO It's supposed to take place in NYC but it didn't feel like NYC at all - except for the one time that they show a shot of the NYC skyline to remind you that, yes, this takes place in NYC. No amount of taxi cabs running over Clary is going to remind me that this is supposed to be in NYC.7) The Valentine-being-Clary's-dad plot twist was not a plot twist. Clary is the protagonist and she's supposed to be exceptional... but she isn't. She literally just exists. We know nothing about her except for the fact that she has ""amazing talents"" that the audience never gets to see because she's always freaking out or being irrationally rude to somebody. Thus, she has to be special for some other reason. Right? BAM, Valentine is her dad. It was the same way with the books. I just knew right of the bat that Valentine was her father.In summary, this movie is extremely nostalgic for me and I appreciate it for that. Lena Headey and Lily Collins are also the loves of my life and they did their best with this garbage-fire script. However this movie was poorly planned, executed even more horrendously, and the characters were all either unlikeable or underdeveloped. There was so much going on that the film felt claustrophobic. I'm 7 years late, but I'm finally ready to submit my rating.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones

The book thief was completely different The Olympians series was completely different, Now this? And they had 60 million dollars, cant they stick to the script?

This movie was an utter disappointment. A lot of things made no sense. Clary does not know she can create runes in City of Bones, and also, the rune she created in the movie is not original. In fact, Valentine had that rune on him that very moment, which was messed up. Bach has nothing to do with Shadowhunters, the Pandemonium is not an adults' club, Jocelyn is not hidden in the Institute, Magnus is not an idiot, Simon was supposed to turn into a rat, Isabelle was boring and for some reason was using a FLAMETHROWER to fight LAVA DEMONS, Alec looked 50 years old and Hodge looked 100 year old.

The plot line was messed up many of the important details were either missing or changed. I am pretty sure they included scenes from the first three books of the series instead of just the first one. The cast were fabulous however. (And may i just say, Jace is incredible and Magnus is pure fabulous) *throws glitter everywhere* Lily Collins played Clarissa Fray very well and Jamie Campbell Bower also played Jace very well at times.

480,sherrylay,Mortal Instruments is one of my favorite all time movies.,10,21 October 2015,"I read the entire series and was dutifully looking forward to the movie coming out. Sadly, I never saw it in theaters due to the poor job of marketing the movie. I admit it had some BIG movies to contend with. After learning it was coming out on DVD I immediately rented it. I was skeptical due to it not doing well in theaters....... Wow! The casting was fantastic! Acting on point...and storyline followed the book pretty well. The only problem I had at the beginning of the movie was the actor who played Jace. I never imagined him to look like that actor....but as the movie continued on I was hooked. I see completely see why he was casted. I can't imagine Jace any other way. So believable! The cinematography was beautifully done. I forgot I was watching a movie because of the seamless scenes. The actors truly became the characters. I now own this on DVD. I will put this along my classic movies because it is truly timeless. My girls absolutely love this and about once a month we watch it together to get our FIX. I am truly disappointed in the negative comments on this movie. I consider myself a movie snob and put this DVD alongside Citizen Cane, Breakfast at Tiffany's etc..... I would love to see these actors reunited in the next installment. Thank you for such a well done movie. Remember that Michael Jordan didn't make his High School Basketball team and I bet that coach is kicking himself in the pants right now. I can assure you the same goes for anyone who never saw this movie based on ""negative ratings. Read the books and go get the movie.

481,godina-63907,I read the book and didn't feel let down at all,10,28 October 2015,"You know for most movies it goes like this- you read the book, you get super high expectations for the movie, you see the movie and you feel let down by something. Whether that's how someone looks or because they had changed the plot line or just overall excluded a character who was rather important in the books and not showing it in the movie at all (Divergent for example). Not in this case. They had all the important characters, they were acted out greatly. I was actually shocked because the house was EXACTLY like I had imagined it to be and so were a few other things. It was incredible actually. I had never experienced that before. At first it was kind of confusing as to how the story line went. I took some time to process it and watched it again and it all made sense. At first I thought that they had put some scenes in the movie which were only supposed to happen in the sequels but it was all just a matter or perspective. They had made the movie perfectly for it to have sequels just like in the books.I was very disappointed when I read that there are going to be no sequels to this movie, only the TV series, I was rather upset because I saw the trailers and was not happy with how it had turned out to be...I think that if they had made all the sequels and wouldn't have given up on them, they would've been way greater that the ""Hunger games"" series or ""Divergent"". Those had let me down way more than expected. Overall great job. I watch this movie every day. I'm serious. I spend my time in school day-dreaming about the movie and about getting to watch it when I get home. I'm in love.

482,paigelaurenwelburn,visually stunning: The film that could have been,3,20 December 2017,"Here we see a film ruined by Hollywood film industry bulls*~t. for all intents and purposes this film was visually a breathtaking piece of art. As a fan of the source material I can say without a doubt that when i read the books this is the world that I picture. The atmospheric world building in this film is spectacular.The props were authentic to the very minute details. They built weapons and tools like the stele's that simply don't exist in this world and managed to bring them to fruition with flare.The cast and costume was on point. the character descriptions fit the cast to the letter. the colour pallet fit into the magical otherworldly element of the books, sticking to oranges and reds and blues. And don't even get me started on the score. It was magnificent. Everything about this film screamed atmospheric and authentic to the source material. There in lies all of this films issues. It's all superficial. in the midst of hyped teen franchises like the hunger games, harry potter and divergent, the industry put all there efforts into a rushed release of this franchise. The creators clearly had no regard for the content. they over shot and sacrificed content for money and tried to mesh elements from the first 3 books into 1 poorly constructed plot for the sake of attracting teens not familiar with the books.The acting leaves something to be desired curtousy of the cheesy and poorly adapted script, choosing to shoot for whimsically funny...but falling flat. Pacing is clunky and all sense of why you sat down to watch this film is lost in the 2nd act. The conclusion is anticlimactic and makes no sense. Clary kind of froze her dad to death...but didn't. but maybe she did since it was never explained. Everything from a content point of view for this film was just awful. It screams rushed and poorly executed. And it's a damn shame too. This very well could have been the next harry potter teen sensation film franchise...but unfortunately it fell through the cracks of the money grabbing film industry.This may be the Prettiest film I've ever hated.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
483,winkypiplup,So After Reading The Book...,10,29 November 2015,"So After Reading The Book I Watched The Movie, And Though It Was A Bit Out Of Order, but It Was Great! By out of order I mean, I read the book first,then watched the movies so the events happened in a different order.The action sequences were great, and the part where *SEMI SPOILER!* Clary calls Alec gay. The movie had action sequences, like when the vampires attacked everyone from the institute, the movie also has love, comedy, and just sad moments, like when Clary finds out Simon is a vampire. *End Of Spoiler*That's my thoughts on the movie, and why I gave it a 10 out of 10! To recap, I love the movie for it's action sequences, comedy, romance, and all of it's emotions. The movie deserves a 10 out of 10 and that's why I gave it one!",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
484,paigepall,Mortal Instrument: Ciity of Bones... great movie!,9,4 December 2015,"When I first caught the movie on a pay channel, I was intrigued. (Never read the book series, so no comparison or expectation was preconceived.) In my opinion, the movie had an interesting plot, with enough information for any intelligent viewer to understand. The characters were believable, unfortunate that only a few Shadow Hunters were still in existence. There was a definite attraction between Clary and Jace, which led to their heated encounter in the observatory. The movie defines that there are two different factions between good and evil regarding the use of the Mortal Cup.(Its powers were sufficiently explained.) I totally enjoyed the action, special effects!The ending was a definite cliff hanger and I dearly wish there would be sequel(s)to further define roles of Jocelyn, Luke, and where the relationship between Clary and Jace stands. Definitely keep the same actors. I've purchased the movie and watch it quite often!Extremely disappointed that the direction seems to be a TV series, with completely different actors. I doubt I will even attempt to watch the series.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
485,rosereaper,It is epic,10,20 February 2016,I was pleased with this movie. I love how some of it relates to the book I would like to see another film like this. I liked how Clary and Jace have this invisible click. That some people don't have it is like they are mentioned to be together. The romance of the film with Alec and how he loves Have but Have don't love him in that but instead he loves him as a brother.How Izzy is in love with Simon but he loves Clary instead of Izzy.Over all the plot was brilliant and action packed adventure. Overall I love it so much. I would watch it over and over again. It is so lovely if you like that vampire and demon type of thing.,The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
486,u-37948,Both Book and Movie are awesome.,10,21 February 2016,"This movie is exceptional. The book is just as good, actually it's better, but of course the in my opinion is the book is alway better. Spoiler Alert. I just love that Clary and Jace get together just like in the book. All of the actors in the movie portrayed the characters very well. I hope you watch it over and over like I did. I have watched so many time I almost have the entire movie memorized. Movie is amazing and comes so close to the book it is even more amazing. It is rated PG-13 so I would not suggest show it to your kids if you have any. I really hope that they make the rest of the movies that are the in series (City of Ashes, City of Glass, City of Fallen Angels, City of Lost Souls, and City of Heavenly Fire). Please enjoy the movie.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
487,vinni-44500,Spoils the third book in first movie,1,27 March 2016,"My biggest complaint is the fact that the first movie spoils the big twist from the third book. If people haven't read the books yet or only read the first book before seeing the movie, they are deprived of one of the series' biggest mysteries. This movie was so bad, I'm a actually shocked they got the green light for a series. At least the TV show is making the story it's own so I can treat it like a new Canon or AU. I don't know how this movie got any favorable reviews. JRM is one of my favorite actors, but his portrayal of Valentine may have been the absolute worst part of the movie. Godfrey Gao and Robert Sheehan were the only redeeming qualities of this movie, but even they could not save this complete train wreck. Luckily we will never see a sequel because of how poorly this movie performed at the box office.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
488,victoriaruthsmart,Decent adaptation,8,28 December 2019,"All the main characters from book 1 and the plot follows the book enough to cover the key story line.
I thought the actors were all good and the director did well with the world building.
Less fighting and more plot building would have better set up the film of book 2.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
489,lurane_kortness,The Mortal Instruments City of Bones,10,10 May 2016,"I really loved The Mortal Instruments City of Bones and can not wait for the sequel to come out. I think she should stay in love with Jace. I do not think he is her brother so I hope they find out he is not and they fall deep in love. They are both trying to do the right thing for everyone and they will keep everyone safe with there followers. The other guy her friend she has thought of him as more of a brother and I think he should always be brotherly to her. I think you should not make Jace a bad guy to help her father, I think you should chose another villain for that or make him a villain and have her somehow win him back to the good side. That would be a really good story also. I truly loved the movie and I know no matter what you do with the second I will love that one two. I really loved the Twilight series also. I read that some did not care for that series. Thankyou so very much for letting me write a comment and I hope the movie comes out soon. Thankyou so very much.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
490,suprise-16693,This movie is so good!!,10,5 July 2016,"OMG! I love this movie. I can watch it over and over again. The story and the characters are so good. I've read all the books and i don't mind that they don't follow the story line. The movie is still great. The actors play the characters so well. Jamie Campbell Bower plays Jace so good, hes really like the Jace in the books. He is perfect for the roll. Lily Collins also play Clary very good. All the actors has really captured the small things that makes there characters so special. I really really hope that the movie makers will continue with the City of Ashes movies. The books deserve to be made into movie series. And that the same actors from City of Bones follow, because it's them that makes the movies so good. I sign this to make the City of Ashes move happen.

491,anht-06849,When isn't the book better?,3,12 October 2016,"This review might contain spoilers.With very few new original ideas or reimagining that are still trapped in the creative mind, filmmakers sometimes must turn to preexisting properties. The main source of this being books. Who doesn't want to see a real personified version of their favorite book character? However, how far can this go? Basically, fans should be prepared to see scenes and details cut for their beloved series. But how much can this hurt or help a movie adaptation? City of Bones is the first book of a six book series about a girl named Clary Fray who finds out she's not your 'average girl' and part of secret demon-hunting race known as the Shadowhunters. After her mother is kidnapped, Clary must work alongside accomplish Shadowhunter Jace Wayland to not only find her mother, but a recently lost artifact from his clan called the Mortal Cup. This book is basically the construction of the magical world Cassandra Clare has created and background info needed for this series and is considered by many fans of the series to be one of their least favorite because of this and its slow pace. Due to this and the movie only being two hours long, unlike many other fantasy movies, much is lost in the constructing this magical world, characters' background, and their motivations.I know movies differ from their source material, sometimes, but The Mortal Instruments City of Bones movie takes this to a whole another level. In both the book and movie, a character is supposed to betray the team to the antagonist. However, in the book, he attacks the main character after his curse is lifted, part of the book's mythos that was left out of the movie, before she saved by other character. This mythos plays a big part in the series. It showed how harsh and unforgiving the central government of the Shadowhunters were. They put a curse on this character where he/she was forbidden to leave the home base of the Shadowhunters in New York City area. The movie, however, makes it where he allows demons to penetrate the institute by opening the ceiling with a lever which he breaks off, hides only a few feet away so he can return to redeem himself before the end of the movie. In the book series, he does return but not until a later book and he never really gets a redeeming moment. The Mortal Instruments City of Bones is also a bad movie, because it loses many of the themes from the book. Like many of the more recent books in the Young Adult genre, this book questioned certain political views. Going back to lost information, we never even get a mention of the governing of the Shadowhunter clan. The movie doesn't even show how Shadowhunters dislike mundanes, or normal humans like you and me, or the Downworlders, basically the magical beings of this worlds. Other than Shadowhunters, that basically everyone they are supposed to be protecting. Are Shadowhunters really as good as they think they are? The book shows us both the light side and dark side of things. Is our main character really a good person? What about her mother? Is Jace a product of our antagonist's mind or is own person? Speaking of our antagonist.Lastly, The Mortal Instruments movie utterly changing of the antagonist and the spoiler that went along with that. In the book, one of the scarier thing about the antagonist is the way he could manipulate people with just his words, twisting their wills, meeting his own desires even if it was benefiting the other person or not. The movie portrays him like a villain you would find in a children's TV show. This leads me to the spoiler that the antagonist and our good friend mentioned above reveal in the movie. I will not give it away here, but the movie flat out gives away a spoiler for the book series that isn't supposed to be answer till book three. In the books, the audience is carried along with the suspense with the characters, not knowing the truth till they know. This not only changed the dynamic of the rest of the series if they had continued with some other minor changes to the ending of the movie, but the dynamic of a very complex character. I don't believe that his backstory was mention or, if so, was simpled down. All this and much more is why I would strongly recommend reading the book over watching the movie.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
492,ahs_2004_acm,"Fans of the book will love it, others may be confused",9,22 August 2013,"I saw the movie last night and I would give the movie an 8 out of 10. I honestly really liked the movie, but was the book better? Of course it was. But what people need to understand is that they took a book that was almost 500 pages in length, and tried to fit all that they could into a 2 hour movie. The first hour and a half I honestly think was very very close to the book. Maybe a few minor changes or a re-arrange of order, but I felt everything was there. The only time when I believe it diverted from the book was the last 30 minutes. But those 30 minutes were still very entertaining. I can understand why the critics have been slamming it though, because they really did give A LOT of information to take in, and all this information was given at a very fast pace. (It might leave some people throwing their hands up if they've never read the book.) The movie was definitely one of the fastest paced movies I have ever seen. But this movie was great, and I truly believe a giant majority of the fans will love it. I took two people whom have never touched the book, and they both loved it, and are hoping they will make City of Ashes. (Even though they say the next movie is green-lit, we all know anything in the movie industry can stop production and or happen). Just remember you're going into a movie that is based off the book, not an exact replica. Just sit back, relax, watch your favorite characters come to life, and enjoy the adventures of the shadowhunters in the Mortal Instruments - City of Bones.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
493,justmyopinion-64108,Cinematically stunning,6,27 November 2017,Okay taboo to review this film as a fan but honestly don't hate it. From a visual point of view anyway. And yes I've read the books and yes I've watched the TV show (total waste of time. Complete trash). This film falls into a franchise pit of money. They wanted to sell this to all audiences and appeal to people who weren't fans and in doing so f#*ked up the content. The film itself is visually stunning. The cinematography. The costumes. The props. The settings. They are all what you picture when you read the books and picture the Shadowhunter world. The aesthetics are spot on. And my god the score of this film is amazing. But the acting leaves something to be desired mainly down to the scriptwriter who could write nothing but cheese. Pacing was clunky and they tried to cram too much into 2 hours. It just wasn't well thought out. Had they cared about the content or characters this film could have been amazing. It had so much potential but instead it's another franchise that fell through the cracks of the money grabbing film industry,The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
494,erinacolonna,Way better than the first Twilight movie!,8,26 July 2020,"You guys are ridiculous. Because you were hellbent on this movie being awful they gave us Shadowhunters, which IS awful. None of you remember the first Twilight movie? That movie gave me secondhand embarrassment.
These movies could've been something great, and now because of all of the negative reviews and opinions we will never have the books properly brought to life. Congratulations.The acting could have been better in some parts, but it is the first adaptation and there was room to grow in the movies to follow. I thought the storyline was followed very well, other than changing some things here and there to hook viewers who HAVEN'T read the books. Overall the movie is great and I was excited to see more of them. I'm sad they didn't get the chance they deserved.",The Mortal Instruments - City of Bones
