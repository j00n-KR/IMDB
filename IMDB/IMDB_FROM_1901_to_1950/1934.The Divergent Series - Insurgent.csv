0,Leofwine_draca,It's a cheat,2,14 March 2016,"INSURGENT is the latest young adult dystopian thriller to hit cinemas, following on from the previous instalment, DIVERGENT. I didn't like the first film, which had potential but wasted it in a too-familiar storyline, but this film is far, far worse. It's a movie that cheats and destroys audience expectations throughout by fuddling every single dramatic moment in the whole story.The whole gamut of ways to cheat a viewer occur here: dramatic events that turn out to be dreams, characters who die but turn out not to be dead, characters who become turncoats only to reveal that they're not so bad after all. Basically everything important in the plotting is a lie, and that's the kind of thing that really annoys me as a viewer. Come the end of the film, very little of actual substance has taken place.Otherwise, we get a bloated storyline with barely any good set-pieces or incidents, and instead just a lot of back and forth stuff. The emoting is particularly over the top this time around, and during a key scene in which star Shailene Woodley is forced to recall some past traumatic events, I found myself sniggering at her pitiful attempts at emotion. She's really bad, which is a surprise given she was quite good in the first film. The big name stars like Naomi Watts and Kate Winslet are poor too, and genuinely good players like Jai Courtney and Ray Stevenson are underutilised.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
1,SnoopyStyle,basic problem with the premise,5,6 December 2015,"Erudite leader Jeanine (Kate Winslet) has instituted martial law to hunt down the supposed Divergents. Her people recover a five-sided box that is the key to the struggle which only a Divergent can open. Tris Prior (Shailene Woodley) escapes the Abnegation massacre with Four (Theo James), Caleb (Ansel Elgort) and Peter (Miles Teller). They hide among the Amity until Dauntless attack. Peter returns to Dauntless and Caleb tries to return to Abnegation. Four reveals that he is Tobias Eaton, the son of Factionless leader Evelyn (Naomi Watts).I still don't buy the central premise that people don't go outside the wall. I'm willing to put it aside but it still feels wrong. I keep wondering why they don't simply migrate outside the wall. Hiding out is a good option but going back is a horrible one. It makes it hard to connect to a story that feels so wrong. It may make more sense if they're stuck on an island or in a vast underground complex. A wall doesn't make it impenetrable unless it's built by Trump. The other central premise that society is divided seems too simplistic and unreal. It may work for a teen novel but I can't imagine people as these simplified cliques. It's more compelling for high school kids.The set designs continues to be superior to others of its genre. Shailene Woodley definitely gives it her all. The actors are never the problem in this franchise. I can understand what the premise is suppose to be but I don't see how any of it is logical. After Tris is taken prisoner, the movie stops its forward momentum and it becomes one meaningless simulation after another. It's beautifully rendered but it doesn't have any real intensity. It takes awhile before the forward momentum returns. Despite the loopy story, Shailene maintains my rooting interest. There is a basic structural problem with this series. The movies make the best of the flaw material.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
2,Prismark10,Detergent,3,4 August 2015,"I only saw Divergent last year and I have completely forgotten the film apart from all that train jumping they did and it was another kind of The Hunger Games variant but based in a dystopian future world of a rigid caste system.The sequel has Divergents Tris (Shailene Woodley), Tobias 'Four' (Theo James) Peter (Miles Teller) and Erudite Caleb (Ansel Elgort) take refuge in Amity but dictatorial Erudite leader Jeanine Matthews (Kate Winslet) sends her soldiers to find them.Our group must find the remaining Dauntless warriors and the Factionless and lead an insurgency in some post apocalyptic Chicago. They must find out what Tris's family sacrificed their lives to protect and why the Erudite leaders will do anything to stop them.The McGuffin here is a box that only a Divergent can open and for which you have to enter a world of Inception otherwise known as death defying simulated adventures that you have to survive to open the box of secrets.The film is turgid, barely maintains your interest. When Jai Courtney turns up pursuing our heroes, you know you are in the safe hands of a film franchise killer.Shailene Woodley as the bland, whimpering lead barely keeps the film together. She certainly is no Jennifer Lawrence and its left to Winslet to keep things going as the villain. The only other actor of note is a shifty Miles Teller who has since broken out on his own after Whiplash.The film has numerous silly problems. There is a fight scene with an unruly mob in a train which goes on for a bit and several people get killed until Four reveals his identity and everyone stops and becomes friends. Why did he not do that in the first place? Its this kind of silliness that makes the film an incoherent mess.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
3,claudio_carvalho,Average Sci-Fi Adventure,6,16 August 2015,"Beatrice ""Tris"" Prior (Shailene Woodley), Four (Theo James), Caleb (Ansel Elgort) and Peter (Miles Teller) are hidden at the Amity facility but out of the blue, Eric (Jai Courtney) and his men arrive to hunt them down. Tris, Four and Caleb are betrayed by Peter but they succeed to flee by train to the Faceless area. However they have to fight against them but when they find that Four is Tobias Eaton, they bring them to their compound. Soon they discover that Four's mother Evelyn (Naomi Watts) is the leader of the Faceless. Then Caleb leaves them and Four and Tris head to the Dauntless expecting to join them to the Faceless. Meanwhile Eric is hunting Divergents for Jeanine (Kate Winslet) that needs them to open a mysterious box. What is the secret of the box?""Insurgent"" is an average sci-fi adventure and sequel. The story is full of action and good special effects, but Peter's character is a complete mess. The most incredible is that there will be a sequel divided in two parts. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""A Série Divergente: Insurgente"" (""The Divergent Series: Insurgent"")",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
4,nogodnomasters,MAY THE TRUTH SET YOU FREE,8,20 November 2018,"The film opens with a narration to give you the basic outline of society and the issue in case you are like me and confuse all these films that are a year between releases. I am glad they did this or else I would have been looking for a vampire with handcuffs and a bow running through a maze. Tris (Shailene Woodley) is a ""deadly divergent"" and is wanted by Jeanine, (Kate Winslet) the ruler, so she can open a ""Hell Raiser"" looking puzzle box. Theo James ""Don't call me Tobias"" is her love interest. Miles Teller as Peter had the best role which allowed him to do some acting.I loved Shailene Woodley in ""White Bird in a Blizzard"" but in this film, I really couldn't get into her character. In fact nearly all the characters were cardboard exhibiting mediocre writing that goes along with ""go in happiness."" The main plot drags a lot and if not for the special effects of the SIM world the movie would fall flat. Oscar winner Octavia Spencer has a small role and doesn't get to strut her stuff.And what was that scene where they hop the train? They are actually running FASTER than the train when they jump on it. Seriously? And then the train speeds away once they get on so their antagonist can't catch up to it,This is another fun teen fantasy film, not to be taken seriously even with $110 million US dollar budget.Guide: One mouthed F-bomb near end. Implied sex. Side breast? I liked the film in spite of its short comings.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
5,kosmasp,Nightmare on Divergent Street,6,3 July 2015,"I wouldn't have been surprised if at some point Freddy Krueger would have popped up to say ""hello"". But apart from a big chunk of the movie dealing with Nightmares, this is a step up from the first entry in the series. While still not great (some of the clichés are just really tough to handle, one concerning your Whiplash lead, being the one of the worst ""leafs"" you have seen lately), it still has quite a few things going for it.One of them being the better special effects. It also tries to distance itself from the Hunger Games series (which never hid or mentioned what it was copying itself, Battle Royale being one of the sources). Does it succeed? That's up to you to decide. Every teenage movie (YA as the movies and books are called) going for that theme, will have that comparison. I'm not sure if the next one will be the last, but even if it so, the next YA movie series will be coming soon ... they are just too successful ...",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
6,Tweekums,A solid follow-up to 'Divergent',8,12 July 2019,"This film opens five days after the end of 'Divergent'; Jeanine has declared martial law and placed the blame for the massacre of Abnegation on Divergents. Tris, Four and others who survived have found sanctuary with Amity Faction but must move again when Dauntless forces loyal to Jeanine turn up. They manage to escape and find themselves amongst the factionless. They then continue into the city and reunite with other free members of Dauntless at Candour Faction. While this is going on Jeanine acquires a box containing a message from the city's founders... to open it she requires a Divergent who rates extremely highly in each of the five faction tests. Not surprisingly the person who is most likely to achieve this is Tris. Jeanine issues an ultimatum; either Tris surrenders to her or she will cause people to die.I enjoyed 'Divergent' so was keen to watch this; I was not disappointed. It might help that I never read the books so aren't bothered by its failure to stay close to the original story. The film is packed with action from start to finish; some of this is 'real world' with obvious dangers and some takes place in simulations which appear to be no less dangerous but allow the impossible to seem possible in spectacular ways. The special effects are very impressive throughout. The cast is solid; most notably
Shailene Woodley who is great as Tris... and looks stunning with a pixie cut! Theo James is good as Four and Kate Winslet is suitably unpleasant as Jeanine. I liked how the film gave us a look at the lives of two more factions, Amity and Candour, as well as showing the factionless as more than just future homeless people. There are of course some flaws; one still has to suspend ones disbelief to accept the faction system and there isn't the sense of danger I'd like... since Tris is the protagonist I never suspected she might get permanently harmed. Overall though I'd say I enjoyed this film as much as he first; it may not have been the most original film but it was more than just sufficiently entertaining. On the strength of this I won't waste too much time before watching 'Allegiant'.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
7,ma-cortes,"Exciting second installment in which Tris will be forced to make difficult choices about sacrifice , love , courage, and allegiance",6,15 October 2018,"Insurgent movie is a sci-fi, action and drama movie based on a book by Veronica Roth . It contaisn noisy action , rhrills , chills , high body-count and impressive state-of art FX . Sixteen-year-old Tris Prior (Shailene Woodley) lives in a dystopian society divided into five factions. and now she seaches answers in the ruins of a futuristic Chicago. As each faction represents a different way of handling things. Erudite are the intelligent. Candor the honest. Abnegation the selfless. Amity the kind. Dauntless the brave.The Erudite have declared war against Abnegation, because they think that they have important information about the Divergent, who are apparently dangerous for the faction-system. After the earth-shattering revelations of Divergent and beyond the wall enclosing Chicago , Beatrice Prior is running with her brother Caleb (Ansel Elgort) and with her sweetfriend Four (Theo James) from enemies . All of them have to continue her fight against a nasty alliance run by Kate Winslet which threatens to tear her society apart with the help from others on her side. Tris approaches the residents of Amity led by Johanna (Octavia Spencer) , but they all stand away from her. Later on , they meet the Factionless leader and Four's mother, Evelyn (Naomi Watts). Tris faces one impossible challenge after another as she unlocks the truth about the past and ultimately the future of her world. In order to survive, Tris has to make imposible decission about herself and her beloved friends. One Choice Can Destroy You and to finally discover the shocking truth of the world around her .It's a standard Science Fiction with no much sense where there is suspense, thriller, getaways and pursuits , frenetic action , struggles , explosions , violence and enough characterization . Dealing with a girl who is escaping with his fiance and brother from the enemy, while unleashing new secrets about her family's past , hers parents , Tony Goodwyn- Ashley Judd, and her mysterious Divergence . It is a very loose rendition of Veronica Roth's novel, that packs a vastly different screenplay , unlike the first movie . It takes parts of a successful trilogy , in the films ""Insurgent"" is the sequel to ""Divergent"" and is followed by ""Allegiant"" with Allegiant -part 2 being called ""Ascendant"". Whereas there are only actually 3 books in the trilogy. Shailene Whooley gives an acceptable acting as the brave teen who is haunted by her past and takes desperate , risked choices to protect the ones she loves , as well as she must confront her inner demons . Support cast is frankly excellent such as : Ansel Elgort , Jai Courtney , Miles Teller, Zoë Kravitz , Ray Stevenson , Kate Wislet , Naomi Watts , Ben Lloyd-Hughes , Cynthia Barrett , Ashley Judd , Tony Goldwyn and Octavia Spencer . The picture contains a colorful and brilliant cinematography by Florian Ballhaus , it was mostly filmed in Atlanta instead of Chicago and being the first film in the ""Divergent"" series to be released in 3D . As well as a thrilling and adjusted to action musical score by Joseph Trapanese . The motion picture was well directed by Robert Schwenke , though Neil Burger was meant to direct this film, but couldn't due to scheduling conflicts with post-production on Divergente (2014). Robert Schewenke has directed a few but successful films such as : The Time Traveler's Wife ,Tattoo , Flightplan , Allegiant and his last one made in Germany : The captain .",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
8,moonspinner55,Homogenized science fiction for bored teenagers,5,21 December 2015,"Nothing in ""Insurgent"" looks original; it's an expensively-produced scrapheap of not just clichés but scenes and dialogue from other movies. Everything has been programmed to appeal to as wide a teenage audience as possible, with multi-racial young actors so trendy-pretty they are practically embalmed. Adapted from the second book in author Veronica Roth's trilogy, this sequel to the 2014 film ""Divergent"" is sketchy on narrative and even sketchier on developing what plot there is and the characters it involves. Shailene Woodley (a Jennifer Lawrence hopeful) and Theo James return as Tris and Four, here running through post-apocalyptic Chicago to evade the Erudite army and its leader, Jeanine (played again by Kate Winslet, as if she were sucking on a lemon). This futuristic war for power is fraught with inanities, head-butting fight scenes, and a box of unknown origin--sort of a Pandora's Box of historical data--that can only be opened by a Divergent. These teen rebels seem inexhaustible, and are tanned, tattooed and groomed to a fare-thee-well; it seems almost a crime to expect them to act. Casting directors are still of the ancient mindset that prettier people on the screen (their lips as puffy as possible) will reel in the youngsters, not realizing that better scripts and more plausible rebels are enough to bring in not just the target audience but curious grown-ups as well. This computer-designed adventure is glossy and shiny and fake, but some viewers are hypnotized by that artificial sheen, conned into believing that what they've just witnessed is an experience, something of value. ** from ****",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
9,Coventry,Barbie and Ken in Dystopia!,3,28 January 2019,"Last week, my dear wife and I watched ""Divergent"", which was a predictable and daft but nevertheless endurable dystopian thriller targeted at teenage girls. My wife wanted to see ""Insurgent"" now, even though I tried to persuade her that it's never a good idea to watch a sequel in a series where the original is already just so-so. ""Divergent"" was predictable, which pretty much means that ""Insurgent"" is an open book entirely. Evidently heroine Tris and her lover boy Four are blamed for Evil Queen Kate Winslet's genocide scheme that went awry. Of course they will have to seek help from people they swore never to speak with ever again. And, unmistakably, they will have to reach out to the cowardly leaders of the other fractions and convince them to stand up against the megalomaniac Jeanine and her elite Erudite army. Will they succeed? Gee, what do you think?Okay, maybe I shouldn't sound so arrogant. I'm a 37-year-old male who preferably watches mean-spirited horror movies and obscure cult cinema, so I'm not in the target audience group of Veronica Roth's books or these hi-tech film adaptations. Notwithstanding, the quality level of the screenplay for ""Insurgent"" forces me to think the producers and the director underestimate the intellect of their target audience. Even after the approximately 47th simulation sequence, the writers still think they can fool us into believing Tris' next ordeal is reality, for sure. These simulation sequences are utterly grotesque and preposterous, by the way. We're talking floating houses on fire and dead-mother holograms. And, seriously, what's with all the shattering glass and pulverizing decors? Is this supposed to be cool? Are we supposed to be impressed? All it does is establish that the responsibility of the special effects was in the hands of immature digital nerds. Shailene Woodley still doesn't look like a convincing and brave heroine, not even with her hair cut short, and particularly Theo James must have felt quite ripped off when he got hold of the script. In ""Divergent"" he was a tough and hunky rebel, but in ""Insurgent"" he is downgraded to Tris' docile and obedient sidekick. They are kind of like Barbie & Ken, in fact.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
10,utgard14,Yawnfest,4,27 December 2015,"I wasn't blown away by the first Divergent movie. I liked it for what it was but recognized it as highly derivative and predictable; yet another in a long line of 'Young Adult' novels translated into films with a similar story. This one picked up where the first left off, which I admittedly had to do some reading up on to refresh my memory. That speaks to how forgettable these things are. Anyway, it's an unexciting movie with dull set pieces and a story you have to fight to care about. The actors do fine but they can't make the material work. After the first movie I was willing to continue with the series and see the story to its end. Now, I'm not so sure. I just found this such a chore to sit through that I have no desire to see what happens next. The news that the third movie will be split into two does nothing to help matters. You could hold a gun to my head and make me watch one more Divergent movie but two? That better be a big gun. There's not much I can recommend about Insurgent. Obviously it does not stand on its own and requires you have seen the first movie to even begin to have a clue what's happening. Even if you have seen the first one, I'm not sure you'll find it easy to follow what's going on all the time. It's serviceably generic in every way. It does nothing to improve upon Divergent, just kicks the ball slightly further down the field toward the ever-elusive 'point' the story will hopefully reach. The only thing left to say is that, if you were confused about Kate Winslet's involvement with this stuff, you'll be even more confused when you see Naomi Watts has joined her. Ladies, I'm sure you were paid well but you know you're better than this.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
11,zardoz-13,Gives Sequels A Good Name!!!,9,13 April 2015,"The second film in a cinematic franchise can often make it or break it. Happily, ""Insurgent"" gives the ""Divergent"" franchise a good kick where it counts, with several imaginative scenes. ""RED"" director Robert Schwentke and screenwriters Brian Duffield, Akiva Goldsman, and Mark Bomback have taken liberties with Veronica Roth's bestseller, but they've improved it. The action unfolds with Tris Prior (Shailene Woodley of ""The Spectacular NOW""), her boyfriend Four (Theo James of ""Underworld: Awakening), his brother Caleb (Ansel Elgort of ""Carrie""), her friend Christina (Zoë Kravitz of ""After Earth""), and her frenemy Peter (Miles Teller of ""The Maze Runner"") seek refuge at Amity. Johanna (Octavia Spencer of ""The Help"") sanctions their stay. Nevertheless, ruthless Jeanine (Oscar winner Kate Winslet of ""The Reader"") dispatches her goons to grab them. Our heroine and heroes manage to pull off a narrow escape, scrambling out of Amity with Jeanine's trigger-happy henchmen blazing away at them with assault weapons, before our heroine and heroes hitch a ride aboard a train bound for Chicago. Little do they know that the train that they have boarded is occupied by the Factionless, led by Edgar (Jonny Weston) who winds up escorting Four to Evelyn (Naomni Watts) who amounts to a quasi-villain. One of the best things about ""Insurgent"" is that the villains are punished. Unsavory Dauntless leader Eric (Jai Courtney of ""Felony"")finds himself on the wrong end of the gun for a change. Meantime, our plucky heroine Tris participates in several shoot-outs and experiences several simulated sessions with her mother, who died in the previous movie, but reappears as a ghost in this one. Like most second films, ""Insurgent"" doesn't preoccupy itself with exposition as much as melodrama. Miles Teller is particularly villainous, but he surprises us by fade-out, and Shailene Woodley delivers a dynamic performance. The devastated Chicago setting with the bridges raised on the river to prevent passage is still as striking as ever.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
12,oscaralbert,CGI has all kid's authors writing the same story . . .,7,28 March 2015,". . . as only the most deluded fan-boy could argue that there's ANY significant difference between the theme and plot direction of THE GIVER, THE HUNGER GAMES, THE MAZE RUNNER, and DIVERGENT. This quartet of recent releases all share the common thread of being dumbed down versions of THE TRUMAN SHOW, from way back in 1998. All five of these ""worlds"" involve characters who are born and raised in decades-long (or centuries-old) closed-system social experiments reliant upon computer gaming concepts to conceal the Real World from some or all of the populace. TRON and SNOWPIERCER are two of the less copy-cat efforts along these lines. As for INSURGENT and similar fodder of this ilk (including at least five more sequels planned for the ALLEGIANT HUNGER RUNNER clone wars), I say: stop hogging all the multiplex screens! We need more films about cancer teens, kids visiting Heaven, and flicks based on Nicholas Sparks novels!",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
13,neil-476,OK sequel but not outstanding,7,20 March 2015,"In dystopian future post-apocalyptic Chicago-ish, divergent Triss is on the run, unable to find sanctuary with any of the factions operating outside the city, although there is a resistance movement which would welcome her. However, she turns herself in to dictator Jeanine in order to save lives, and Jeanine uses her divergent characteristics to open a box which contains a secret to the whole faction-based system, which Jeanine believes will serve her purpose.Triss' adventures continue, and Shailene Woodley continues to acquit herself well as a likable action heroine and protagonist. In part 2, the divergent series finds its feet a bit better than in the first film, and starts to become more its own thing than simply the Harry Potter/Hunger Games rip-off it came across as in the first film. That said, many of the same comments apply – the eye candy is great, the cast is fantastic (though many notable names are wasted in 5-line parts which a no-namer could have handled just as well), and the entirety never quite pulls the disparate elements into a cohesive whole. It's still quite good fun, though.Apart from a couple of carefully constructed set pieces, the 3D is a waste of time.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
14,phd_travel,Grand and exciting follow up,9,19 March 2015,"This is a well done sequel that is grander (no more endless training) and more urgent than the first. The simulations are visually inventive and engrossing without being too spectacular to pull apart the story.Compared to Hunger Games, I prefer the premise and characters in Insurgent. It's less revolting and less irritating. The cast is more attractive too. At least you felt like you were getting a complete enough movie in itself here not chopped off when things started getting interesting.Naomi Watts is attractive as a brunette and though she looks too young to have a son of Theo James's age, it's just so good to see her on screen. Maggie Q doesn't have enough lines but she is welcome presence and believable. Miles Teller has a few comic relief lines and is quite good as the a******. Ansel Elgort is suitably weak looking as the brother. Sometimes their romantic roles in other movies with Shailene come to mind. Shailene's action is quite convincing here and although she still maintains the vulnerable girlishness that makes her role more sympathetic. Theo James and her do have a good on screen believability as a couple. Kate Winslet plays her character just loathsome enough without being a caricature.Overall a good part 2 grand exciting and satisfying with a likable attractive cast. Much more palatable than Hunger Games.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent

Forbidden love, virtual reality, conflict with an evil conspiracy, and a final show down. Reminds me of The Hunger games. The beginning is a continuation of part 1 and ties the story into what is happening for part two. The dispersed group of rebels must adapted and improvise to fix the problem/conflict. The conclusion ties all the lose ends and has the shocking/science fiction ending. Formulated, but well acted and directed. Kate Winslet performs the villain excellently. If you are a fan of the genre you will like Insurgent. If not, the viewer will find Insurgent an inferior movie to Hunger games. Seven out of ten stars.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
16,deloudelouvain,High budget doesn't mean good story,5,28 July 2015,Science Fiction is normally one of my favorite genre of movies to watch and I'm always open to a futuristic story even if they are far fetched. But with this one I'm not satisfied at all. With a budget of 110 000 000 dollars you would think you could make something better. I saw much better Sci-Fi's with a much lesser budget then Insurgent honestly. In fact I think the whole story is too difficult and too boring. I don't say Kate Winslet or the other actors were bad or so. The story was just not good enough to entertain me during the whole movie. I hope this will be the end. We do not need another divergent story again. If they make another one I seriously doubt that I will watch that one.,The Divergent Series - Insurgent
17,siderite,Bad enough to make one doubt IMDb ratings forever,5,14 May 2015,"Divergent was not brilliant, but it was your average young adult movie. Insurgent is way below that. It is so bad that I wanted to leave the theater and read my book.But anyway, let's talk about the movie. In the first film Tris learns she is special, in the second she learns she is *very* special, but just if her boyfriend lets her do anything. Seriously, I actually had to ask my wife if girls like guys like him or is it just the submissive fantasy of the author. Apparently, a lot of girls like overbearing assholes who think they know what is better for you. And guess who makes her appearance in the sequel? The mother in law!Bottom line: the sci-fi aspect of the film was marginal, the characters clichéd to the point of monomolecular cardboard and the basic story was learning to accept yourself as your boyfriend tells you what to do while he deals with his mommy issues. I am not kidding: the most sympathetic character in Insurgent was Peter, the asshole who always insults and betrays everybody.P.S. The Erudite test was remembering something that had happened to you two nights ago? Really? That's what makes you smart?",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
18,KineticSeoul,Meh,5,25 July 2015,"I thought the first film in this franchise was alright, but this was falters a lot more. It's an okay watch, but it's easily forgettable and very far from being original. The concept and the premise just seemed way to familiar, and it didn't seem all that in depth when it came to the story. It just seemed like another fugitives on the run, fighting against a over controlling government that is all about keeping order. Like many teen romance movies and Asian dramas or most movies/TV shows in general, the hook in the beginning leads to the next installment being anticipated by it's fans. Overall, I thought this movie was typical and mundane, but it's still somewhat watchable but easily forgettable. Mainly because of the script that lacks substance.5.8/10",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
19,Hellmant,"'THE DIVERGENT SERIES' may not quite match the quality of 'THE HUNGER GAMES', but it's pretty damn close!",9,26 March 2015,"'THE DIVERGENT SERIES: INSURGENT': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Big budget sequel to the 2014 YA sci-fi hit 'DIVERGENT'. Both films are based on the popular youth book series, by Veronica Roth, about a post-apocalyptic future Chicago; where all of society is divided into factions, based on a citizen's personality and skills (which eliminates the threat of individuality). Shailene Woodley reprises her starring role, as Tris Prior; a 'divergent', who doesn't fit into any faction (and is therefore a big threat to the established society norm). The film takes place three days after the events of the first movie; with Tris, Four and other rebels still on the run from corrupt government forces. Actors Theo James, Miles Teller, Ansel Elgort, Jai Courtney, Zoe Kravitz, Kate Winslet, Ashley Judd and others also reprise their roles from the first film; while Naomi Watts, Octavia Spencer, Daniel Dae Kim and others join the cast. Robert Schwentke (who's also directed action flicks like 'RED' and 'FLIGHTPLAN') took over directing duties, this time around, and Brian Duffield, Akiva Goldsman and Mark Bomback all wrote the screenplay. I don't think it's quite as fun, or memorable, as the original but I do still believe it's a more than decent sci-fi sequel (especially for a YA flick). The movie picks up right where the first one left off (a few days later); with Tris (Woodley), Four (James), Peter (Teller) and Caleb (Elgort) all on the run from pursuing 'Dauntless' soldiers, led by Eric (Courtney) and Max (Mekhi Phifer). Eric, and his squad, have also located an artifact; that Jeanine (Winslet) had them searching for. Jeanine believes the mysterious box, they found, contains a message from their ancestors, that will end the 'Divergent' problem for good. She also needs a 'Divergent' to open it though. While Eric and his men continue to hunt for Tris, and her associates, they also search for other 'Divergents'; to open the box. At the same time Tris and Four team up with an army of the 'Factionless', and their leader Evelyn (Watts). It soon becomes obvious which 'Divergent' is the only person that can open the box, and end the faction war.I love the first movie; I like the cool dystopian world that it created, and it's clever social and political commentary as well. I also like it's message about individuality; and how those that are 'different and unique' are the heroic innovators among us. I also really like Shailene Woodley, I think the first movie showed what a remarkably talented actress she is (it also showed us what a huge move star she's about to become). I think this film only further expands on her impressive strengths and skills. The rest of the cast is good too (especially Teller, who's a scene-stealer in it) but these movies really are the 'Shailene Woodley show'; she's definitely an admirable force to be reckoned with. This chapter (in 'THE DIVERGENT SERIES') is also a lot darker, more brutally violent and action packed; it's everything a classic sci-fi sequel should be. I also really got a strong 'THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK' vibe from it! These movies are also great female driven action flicks; that are both inspiring and just really entertaining (especially for YA films). They're definitely a lot better than similarly marketed youth flicks like 'THE MAZE RUNNER', and they're also far superior to other popular crappy books, turned into crappier movies, like 'TWILIGHT' and 'FIFTY SHADES OF GREY'. 'THE DIVERGENT SERIES' may not quite match the quality of 'THE HUNGER GAMES', but it's pretty damn close.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: youtu.be/NWNdCBWf_Gk",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
20,ThomasDrufke,ImproveGENT,7,21 March 2015,"Setting your expectations low for a movie is always a good idea. That way you never come out disappointed. With Insurgent, I figured it was just the same film as Divergent, just rehashed. It's not exactly a fresh and bold new idea, but it did feel different than the first. And definitely better. With newcomers Octavia Spencer and Naomi Watts the film gets elevated by terrific performances across the board. The cast is great but the CGI doesn't look as fake and the story is less(ish) confusing than Divergent. I will say it didn't bother me at all later in the movie, but it was quite funny and awkward to see Ansel Elgort, Miles Teller, and Theo James all with Shailene Woodley on screen together, considering they have each been a film love interest.The main problem with Divergent was the screenplay. I thought it was too confusing for someone who wasn't familiar with the book series. While Insurgent will be puzzling for newcomers, I felt less confused this time around than last. There's a lot going on. Whole lot of characters that fall in and out of the story without much to do at times, but the performances saved the film. I think if you try to forget about the unexplainable elements of the film your viewing experience is enhanced. For example, I don't remember too much about Tobias' back story or even the exact intentions of Jeanine, but I let the movie play out without complaining. Jai Courtney's character, though terminator like, was an improvement over the one-note character in Divergent. I also thought the chemistry between the leads of Miles Teller, Theo James, and Shailene Woodley were much better this time around. Woodley one again gives an emotionally powerful performance, even if not all of it is actually real, it felt legit. I keep talking about her ability to cry on screen but it's true, the woman can shed a tear.I think one of the main problems with the film is the inconsistencies with some character decisions. I didn't read the books but I just became baffled with some of the directions that Miles Teller and Ansel Elgort's characters. There is too much back and forth for my liking. Kate Winslet and Naomi Watts both steal each of their respected scenes. And although for the former there isn't a whole lot to do, I enjoyed watching her character arc unfold. The ending is a big animal to tackle. And without spoilers I cant talk too much about it, but I will say I was pretty indifferent. I almost feel like they could end the franchise right there. But at the same time I guess there is more of this world to explore, no pun intended. So with a few unneeded characters and with plenty of confusing character decisions, Insurgent turns out to be an okay sci-fi. It's nowhere near as poor as the reviews and much better than the first, but there's still plenty to improve on for the next.+Performances +Watts & Winslet on screen together +Intriguing ending+Better CGI -Similar to first -Occasional unnecessary characters and plot decisions.7.0/10",The Divergent Series - Insurgent

I can't fully describe why I liked this one so much, and it may have been my low expectations for it, but I was entertained and interested the entire time.

23,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,6,6 August 2015,"InsurgentThe worst thing about living in a dystopian world is you're stuck with the same series of iPhone forever.Mind you, the adolescent survivors in this sci-fi movie have more life threatening matters to worry about.When the head of the Erudite fraction, Jeanine (Kate Winslet), gains possession of an enigmatic box that can only be opened by a Divergent, she sends her death squad to round one up.Unable to find a suitable subject she then turns to the gifted rebel Tris' (Shailene Woodley), and uses her Dauntless friends to gain her surrender.Now Tris must pass five virtual aptitude tests in order to unlock the box's secret.The second installment in the questionable adaptation of the popular YA series, Insurgent at least injects some action and motive into this so-far pointless post-apocalyptic parable.Incidentally, the only people looking forward to a post-apocalyptic future besides teenagers, are militant loners.

The kinda ""wow"" factor that was in the first movie has gone from this one, we don't get to know this world more in ""Insurgent"" - the story isn't that intriguing, nor it expands - it is actually a very simple story, which could probably have been finished with this second movie, but i heard there is a third one - if they are still hoping to match a success of ""Hunger Games"" series they should stop doing it - this particular installment ""Insurgent"" doesn't look or feel gritty or realistic at all. Overall, ""Insurgent"" is not a bad movie, but falls short if comparing it to the first one, which i actually enjoyed very much. Acting is OK in here, but this young cast will definitely do better in the future, (except for Jai Courtney - once you are stiff, you will always be stiff). Kate Winslet, Octavia Spencer are clearly just for they paychecks here as well N.Watts. The special effects are OK, but nothing that special, although virtual reality scenes looked good. At the running time 1 h 50 min this movie drags here and there, but nevertheless it worth seeing it once, especially if you loved the first movie, if not - forget this one and don't even bother.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
25,ironhorse_iv,"This movie did surge forward, but the test results with critics, have been mixed.",7,1 April 2015,"I have always thought of the Divergent series as a mediocre step-sister of books trying really hard to live up or outshine its counterpart, the more popular YA series of novel/films, the Hunger Games by author Suzanne Collin. Some people might say, the Divergent series is a total rip-off of Hunger Games, but in my opinion, author Veronica Roth indeed made her own. Her series of books, brings in more of a Sci-fiction psychology like feel that was needed for the young rebellion genre. While, it's not as good, as Hunger Games, the books is still interesting in its own right. Based on the second book of the Divergent series, the movie, Insurgent directed by Robert Schwentke, continues to tell the story of Beatrice Prior (Shailene Woodley), a Divergent, a person with more than one personality trait, trying to escape a futuristic dystopian Chicago, where society is divided into five personality trait factions: Abnegation (the selfless), Amity (the peaceful), Candor (the honest), Dauntless (the brave), and Erudite (the intelligent). Since Divergents can think independently and the government therefore cannot control them, they're considered threats to the existing social order. Without spoiling too much of the film, I believe the premise is a little far-fetched. It is a bit improbable and illogical to believe that society survives with people with one personality trait. In my opinion, I find that most of the characters seem be just as divergent as Beatrice. Like the first movie, the plot in the sequel, could be a bit confusing. The whole exposition somewhat got lost between the transfer from book to screen, as it wasn't that clear to the audience. From, what I can gather up. They add a lot of new things like the mystery box and all the computer simulation sequences. If you, thought the first movie was crazy with its action, this movie takes it, a lot further. The movie goes overboard with its action. A good example is the train sequence with the factionless members. The heroes kill two of their Factionless comrades, because Four (Theo James) didn't state his name, in the beginning. Come on! That scene was deeply overblown. While, a lot of people might like the increase of special effects for this film. I kinda didn't like it, so much. It was a bit jarring. The whole action scenes in the virtual reality, really turn me off, because nothing in those sequence, made me, believe that anything on screen was really happening, so I care little. They look so fake-looking. I didn't like the confusing flying house sequence and people flying all over the place, like superheroes, it so remind me of 2000's Cell mixed the later Matrix's 2003 movies. It was so cartoony in its approach. I was really hoping for a more ground approach to the dream-state like 2010's Inception did with its action. The 3D was alright for the most part, but you can skip it, for 2D. Another thing, the movie change, from the book is some characters. They eliminated or cut down on some of the supporting characters such as Cara, Zeke, Shauna, Fernando, Robert, Susan, & Edward. In my opinion, it kinda works, because they're way too many characters in the book. Still, I hate the fact, that they also change, the main characters, a bit, such as an example, Beatrice not being scare to fight a gun isn't there, anymore. Her being afraid of guns, was kinda a big deal in the novel. Most of the changes kinda works, but fans of the book might be offended, on how loosely based, the movie is, compare the novel. The twist, toward the end, will leave more questions, than answers. You really have to suspense your disbelief, to get, through this film. Some of the good things about the film, are the acting. Once again, Shailene Woodley was pretty good as the lead. The highlight of her performance has to be, the truth serum sequence. Still, they were moments, in the film, that I found her character to be a bit annoying & dumb. Another is her short hair. I kinda wish, she didn't cut her hair, but that's just nitpicking. Theo James seem good as the love-interest, but like the first movie, he's pretty bland and one-dimensional. He doesn't stand out. Like, I say before, Theo James really could kinda could be mistaken for James Franco. The supporting cast is alright with their roles. I really didn't buy, Naomi Watt's character, Evelyn, being the mother of Theo James. Naomi Watt, still looks pretty damn young, despite her age. I'm also find it funny that both Miles Teller & Ansel Elgort, are in this movie, since they played previous lovers to Shailene Woodley's character roles, in other movies in recent film history. I think it's should be note, that I found this to be distracting, as hell. I also didn't like, how everybody looks like a model or really young. It kinda hurts the realistic tone that the film is possible to represent. Unlike the other movie, the movie was missing a good music choice. Everything sound so genetic. Overall: While, the movie has good themes, include rebellion, romance, bravery, courage, friendship, betrayal, the search for individual identity and heroism. I found the movie to be very mediocre. If you really want to see, a good YA movie with Shailene Woodley. Watch 2014's Fault in Our Stars. You can thank me for my candor, later. If you do, choose to watch this movie. Just note, the faults, and go into it, with an open minded approach. Like Amity would say-Go with Happiness.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
26,The-Sarkologist,A pretty poor offering,3,21 March 2015,"I must say that I really didn't like this film all that much though since I had seen the first I felt that maybe I should go and see the second one, though I am having second thoughts as to whether I will go and see any more. Basically the film follows on from the first film where the divergents have fled the city and are now hiding out with one of the factions that lives out in the country. However this what were it was a little confusing. At the end of the first film I thought they have fled behind the wall, however it turns out that they hadn't, but instead were hiding out in one of the rural areas. Secondly I though much of the city had been rebuilt, and from what I can remember of the first film Chicago was nowhere near as ruined as it was in this film.Basically the villain comes across this box hidden in one of the ruins and realises that she must find a divergent to be able to open it, so she sends out her guards (namely the members of Dauntless who remained loyal to her) to track them all down. As it turns out, Trix is the one divergent that is able to open the box, however the problem is that she is in hiding (as are all the other divergents).However, that is all I really feel that I can say about this film. I thought it was boring, the acting was pretty ordinary, and I ended up sitting in my seat for the two hours that the film went for quite uncomfortable and waiting for it to end. It seemed that I enjoyed the first film, and obviously there will be a conclusion, but a part of me simply wants to read the wikipedia entry for the book so I don't have to spend anytime sitting around the cinema watching it when I could be doing something else. I hope they don't go and do what they did with The Hunger Games, and split the final book into two movies, but we will see when they get around to releasing it.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
27,Reno-Rangan,The mystery box and the power hungry leaders!,6,14 July 2016,"This is not a bad sequel, I quite enjoyed it, but I think I liked 'Divergent' better. The story continued a very short after where it ended in the first. In this part, it was all about power hungry where many try to get that top post. On the other side, there will be an attempt to open a mystery box that found which might reveal some important detail about them.Looked like a very good storyline, unpredictable stuffs, but not utilised to its full potential. Though the actors were good, especially Shailene was sexy in her short hairs. I think she came straight out of 'The Fault in Our Stars' to take up this role where her brother in this film was a boyfriend in that.Visually as well very captivating with those great graphics and it is first digital 3D film in the series. It has numerous small twists, especially during decrypting the mystery box. So I felt the middle parts were the best part of the film.I thought this film would take place outside the wall, but a new story was developed and still kept the mystery about the rest of the world. I don't know the book, but that's my disappointment. I hope the next film in the series would go beyond the wall and explore some new things.

The second movie comes and destroys what the first one built. If we abstract the new information that came to light, this movie cannot provide with anything else. Of course as you can understand there is no comparison between the two movies due to the fact that everyone including me was expecting the second movie to be better than the first but this did not happen.Finally I have to say that ""Insurgent"" is an average movie with average interpretation of its main actors Shailene Woodley and Theo James.

29,Floated2,A slight step back in the series,4,24 July 2017,"Insurgent is the sequel to the follow up Divergent released in 2014. There does seem to be more action sequences and stunts both they are repetitive. The entire plot is quite basic, with Tris and Four wanting to find and kill the leader Jeanine (Kate Winslet) since she is doing harm to the other people in the factions and such. A running time of slightly less than two hours, a lot of the film contains slightly meaningless scenes of build up or to make up time. A scene featuring them fighting against 'factionless' people on the train was quite well done but at the same time a little silly and pointless. Following the fight, after causing much damage and killing some of their crew, Four tells the leader of the 'factionless' his name then it all stops, because Four was the one they wanted and were looking for. They apparently didn't know it was him but knew of his name. It would have made a lot more sense had Four stated his name prior to fighting. As well with some of the scenes towards the end involving Tris being in some kind of 'simulation' with wires hooked on her, are thought to be interesting, but at the same time more could have been done and less predictable. The effects looked nice.The weak plot, and not much character development is what was holding this film back, as well with scenes that drag on. This film, one can tell feels quite different than the original and that a different director directed it. The style and tone feel a little off and Tris was slightly different. It's as if she didn't care too much about some of the people that were sacrificing themselves for her, and they made her a little more aggressive, angry and confused but in some ways it was expected. Perhaps a little over the top. Insurgent isn't terrible but it's a slight step back from Divergent. Opinions may differ.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent

I really enjoyed the first movie, there was something unique and interesting about the functions and the training and in the end, it wasn't boring as everything was just enough. But the second movie is simply bland. The action scenes are nothing spectacular, the acting is badly and the whole box thing is boring. Tris is a very complicated character, she looks like she is empathetic, like she doesn't care, or rather like she is bored, but she has a different personality all together, she is violent and frankly doesn't look the part of a hero. In Hunger Games, Katniss did look like she cared and the whole thing at least had a depth, but I don't know if it is the actors or the script that make Tris look odd.

31,filipemanuelneto,"An honorable continuation, but with problems in the script.",7,14 February 2021,"After the resounding success of ""Hunger Games"", American studios were hungry for more films and trilogies for young adults. ""Maze Runner"" and ""Divergent"" were two of the most evident cases, with scripts and source material that, in everything, remind us of ""Hunger Games"".In this film, the follow-up of ""Divergent"", we will see Jeannine's rise to power and the escape of Tris and Four. They lost friends and family in the military coup against Abnegation, and they take refuge with the Amity. The truce, however, is short: while Jeannine needs to find a specific, particularly strong Divergent, who opens a box where the Founders recorded a message, Four will find an unlikely ally, determined to overthrow the Erudite: his mother, Evelyn, who all assumed to be dead.Personally, I think the film is a very dignified continuation, which honors the predecessor and entertains the audience quite well. Nevertheless, and like the first film, the script suffers from serious logic problems. For example, the strange way in which Tris looks traumatized and in shock with the events at the end of the previous film and quickly overcomes this, being able to fight. I think it would have been better for the film to follow the original book more closely, which was not done.Imported from the previous film, the cast is quite good and competent. Shailene Woodley is beautiful, and I was surprised to see her without her long hair, but it was a change of look that fits the film and marks how much the character was marked by the previous events. The actress, moreover, did a good job. Theo James was also excellent, particularly in the action scenes, and I feel that he had more space and screen time to work here. Miles Teller is good, but hateful, and Jai Courtney is even more hateful, brutish and sadistic than in the first movie, which was great, given that the character demanded it. Kate Winslet goes from coldness to absolute inhumanity and transforms Jeannine into a potential genocide, while her arch rival, Evelyn, was brilliantly played by Naomi Watts, clearly implying that she is not, and will never be, a good option to rule the city. On the negative side, I was sad to see the way Zoe Kravitz almost disappeared from the film and I hated the constant changes in loyalty of Ansel Elgort's character.Technically, the film is visually impressive. The cinematography is excellent, vibrant and sharp, and I loved the landscapes of a half-destroyed and decadent Chicago, of dry rivers and lakes and devastated buildings. Incredible, but not coherent: if the entire human population was there, wouldn't more space be needed? Why not rebuild the buildings? Didn't they have two hundred years of peace to do so? Another thing I liked and found amazing was the action and fighting sequences. Really well executed. The sets and costumes were very well done, the highlight being the Amity headquarters, which looks like a mix of futuristic planting and a hippie camp. The soundtrack also fits into the overall ensemble.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
32,leonblackwood,A lot of fuss about nothing! 4/10,4,9 August 2015,"Review: I wasn't a big fan of the first movie so my expectations for the sequel wasn't that high. I also wasn't that bothered about any of the characters and I really didn't remember the plot from the first movie so I went into this film a bit blind. There are a few references to the first film but I thought that the storyline was straight forward and not that bad. The main character, Tris (Shailene Woodley) looked a bit lost all the way through the film and she seemed like she was on her own agenda, regardless about how many people got killed or risked there life for the cause. Its really hard to explain the storyline, as I didn't really remember the first movie but I think that it's about a group of people who are on the run from Jeanine (Winslet) because they didn't want to live in her controlled world anymore. There are other elements to the story but it will take a long time to write about it, so I think I should leave it at that. Basically you have to watch it to get it! Personally, I wasn't a big fan of the film because it all seemed a bit over the top and there wasn't that much depth to the characters. Tris didn't seem that bothered about how many people were sacrificing there life's for her and Winslet was just being a cold bitch on her own agenda, regardless on the amount of life's she was sacrificing as well. Some of the action scenes were OK but I really wasn't a fan of the two main characters. They were just too intense throughout the whole film and they seemed to have the whole world on there shoulders which made them very one dimensional. I lot of the CGI was unnecessary and over the top, especially when she was hooked up to those wires, going through the various simulators controlled by Winslet. At the end of the day, it's a very pointless film which I didn't really find that entertaining but it's watchable and we'll put together. Average!Round-Up: I really liked Shailene Woodley, 23, in a Fault in Our Stars because she brought a lot of emotion and realism to the role but she seemed a bit wooden in this film. Maybe because there was so much going on around her! She does cry very well but she didn't really bring anything to the table, except for a couple of well choreographed action scenes. They still have another two movies planned for this franchise, called Allegiant 1 & 2 so we might get to see another side to her Divergent self. I'm not a big fan of Theo James because he lacks emotion and he seems to play off of his squared jawed looks a bit too much. He just seemed like the loved up action hero throughout the movie who was willing to sacrifice everything for his woman, which was a bit creepy. He obviously hated his parents, which the sequel might delve into after the introduction of Naomi Watts as his mother. She looked more like his girlfriend to me! Anyway, the movie was directed by Robert Schwentke who brought you movies like the terrible R.I.P.D., RED, with Bruce Willis, Flightplan and The Time Travellers Wife with Eric Bana. I would have liked to have seen another director take on the two Allegiant movies, to give the whole franchise a fresh flavour and maybe a more human side to the characters but it looks like this director is committed to the whole franchise. His interpretations of the books has gone down quite well with audiences and he has made an hefty profit for the studios but I personally think that it's a lot of fuss about nothing.Budget: $110million Worldwide Gross: $295millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their adventure/sci-fi/thrillers about a colony of people on the run from there hometown because they didn't want to live under there rules and relegation's. 4/10",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
33,matthewssilverhammer,Dull and Forgettable,3,27 March 2015,"The word ""insurgent"" means to actively revolt, implying some distinctiveness that sets its participants apart from the norm. Ironically, the film Insurgent, a faded photocopy of other teen- scifi-dramas, doesn't have a single unique bone in its body. Not that it's aggressively terrible. There are some decent scifi elements and even a couple of mildly intriguing moments. But like clockwork, every slight turn for the better is quickly overwhelmed by extreme boredom. Like a forgettable SyFy channel series masquerading as a blockbuster film, Insurgent is simply a dull and uninteresting sequel. That word ""sequel"" should connote a progression of sorts, but no. As little as I remember about the previous entry in the Divergent Series, I can tell you this: shaky cam action scenes, bloviating about ""special ones"", and constant fighting for the McGuffin-of-the- week were the focus and are still in full form here. At the center is Woodley, an actress with a whole heckuva lot of talent that simply doesn't have the presence of strength to carry this sort of role. She presents a microcosm problem for an entire film full of great actors terribly miscast. Teller and Elgort manage some natural charisma and charm from their otherwise absent characters, Watts and Spencer are all but completely missing, and Winslet is just plain wasted. It's none of their fault; they just can't make the embarrassingly constant melodrama palatable. Even if it was laughably bad there might be something to cling to, but it's not bold enough to even warrant that reaction. Insurgent only serves as a lame, achingly dull placeholder until the next Hunger Games installment.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
34,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"More passable entertainment from the ""Divergent"" series",5,16 September 2015,"The ""Divergent"" series' middle installment cracks open the series, bringing the entirety of the Dystopian world Veronica Roth created to viewers. We get a glimpse of the factions Amity and Candor before the very faction system is on the brink of dissolving.""Insurgent"" starts more less where ""Divergent"" left off. Our hero, Tris Prior (Shailene Woodley) is hiding out with her new beaux Four (Theo James), brother Caleb (Ansel Elgort) and frenemy Peter (Miles Teller) in the Amity compound following her dismantling of the totalitarian Jeanine's (Kate Winslet) attack on Abnegation. But Tris has come out of that mess a little traumatized, and Jeanine's hunt for divergents, specifically one special enough to open a nifty box she found, is bound to bring it all to the surface. Like the ""Divergent"" script, this screenplay touches on the key moments from the book but doesn't do much to mitigate the confusion between what's going on with all the factions and who is allied with whom — you know, really building out world and the supporting cast. And so much of the action in this movie takes place in Tris' nightmares or in simulations that are obviously simulations, zapping it of a lot of suspense.Tough to blame the writers too much, however. Summit hired two of the most seasoned script doctors out there in Akiva Goldsman (""The Da Vinci Code,"" ""I Am Legend"") and Mark Bomback (""The Wolverine,"" ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"") and while everything about the story ends up making sense and being compelling enough to watch, the heart of Roth's books — how she hooks you with Tris' thoughts and emotions — plays second fiddle.Woodley is a terrific actress and she sells all of Tris' self-hating inner demons exceptionally well, but she feels more like a cog in the story machine than the driving force behind the story itself. Director Robert Schwentke, who replaces ""Divergent"" director Neil Burger, gives her moments and lets her be raw, but it hardly compares to the introspection we've seen in ""The Hunger Games"" series and how that franchise has focused around its heroine.Schwentke proves a competent guide for this series, but not so much a creative one. The aesthetic of ""Insurgent"" does not capture the imagination, nor do the simulations and nightmares, which offer a lot of creative license to a filmmaker. Burger, I feel, handled those better.Yet there's enough talent to go around (including the additions of Naomi Watts, Octavia Spencer and Daniel Dae Kim to the cast) to keep the film afloat. The scenes that need to get your attention get your attention; the actors put you in their characters' shoes; the story moves at a good pace. Honestly, there's nothing especially awful about any aspect of the movie (aside from some of Winslet's unfortunate dialogue), it just feels par-for-the-course. The books are kind of that way too, so maybe enjoying ""Insurgent"" is just about appeasement. It's about satisfying fans of the book and people who enjoy the genre but don't need intellectual stimulation or riveting character drama. I'll stand by the idea that this series could be done better, but maybe not in a way that meets teen blockbuster criteria. I'm at peace that the latter is the direction producers chose to go.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews for more!",The Divergent Series - Insurgent

In the ruins of Abnegation Jeanine's forces find a box made by the founders of the society, but it could only be opened by a divergent, leading to her rounding as many as she can and forcing Tris into conflict with the tyrant once again.The Divergent Series shares a lot of ideas with The Hunger Games, they are set in a post-apocalyptic/dystopia version of America, people are split into different groups because of a certain virtues (Hunger Games it's resources or industry, in Divergent it's a characteristic) and the first film was very Hunger Games like, teenagers being tried trained for action of some sort and the characters who are training get ranked in some way. It was derivative but had it had its moments.Divergent's best feature was its Inception like simulations which allowed the film to be more inventive and it is the same for the sequel. But there are reduced, only appearing in the second half of the film as Tris is being used to open the box. These moments are when Insurgent is the most creative and fun and are on screen only too briefly.Roger Schwentke takes over the directing duties from Neil Burger and he does a decent enough job. Insurgent moves along at a brisk pace, 20 minutes has been cut from the running time and he does have an eye for showing the destroyed Chicago, even if it's mostly CGI. The opening is particularly inventive as it turns the film company logos into a video display and leads to the first scene of the film.The sequel also replaced writers Evan Daugherty and Vanessa Taylor with Brain Duffield, Akiva Goldsman and Mark Bomback. The problem with the original film was it really was just set-up and training sequences and the plot only kicked off during the final thirty minutes. At least the Insurgent can jump into the meat of the of story which allows the film to move quicker. Insurgent is a looser adaptation of its source material and it felt like it was gutted of subplots to keep the film trim. It story involving Tris being the chosen one is generic that it was like the writers read the Hero With A Thousand Faces and that would be enough to tell a story.The action is fine, if unremarkable and it does suffer the villains being unable to shoot people in standing in an open field. The close quarter fighting was better because there was a little be of a threat to them. The special effects were of a high standard, not just for the cityscapes and the simulations but also for the small things like blue computer interfaces that float in the air.Insurgent has a great cast with Woodley making an excellent lead. She is a talented young actress and the shorter hair style suited her more, becoming a stronger presence in the sequel. One of her best moments is when she is given truth serum and suffers pain when she tries to resist. She is also surrounded by a strong cast of young actors, Miles Teller being the best as the slimy weasel Peter, a boy who would sell his mother if the price is right. He was perfect at playing someone you want to hate.The film also has excellent cast of established actors like Octavia Spencer, Naomi Watts, Daniel Dae Kim and Maggie Q but their roles are minor and Kate Winslet's Jeanine was hardly the most compelling villain. Ray Stevenson respites his role as Marcus and only has two lines. Either it was an easy paycheque or a subplot was cut.Insurgent is a perfectly serviceable YA adaptation that should please fans of the genre and fans a Hunger Games style fix.6.5/10.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
36,stevendbeard,More Action,7,20 March 2015,"I saw ""Insurgent"", starring Shailene Woodley-The Fault in Our Stars, The O.C._tv; Kate Winslet-Movie 43, Finding Neverland; Theo James-Golden Boy_tv, Underworld:Awakening and Naomi Watts-Movie 43, The Ring.This is the sequel to the Divergent movie from 2014 and it is the second of a total of four films that are based on the YA books written by Veronica Roth-I think the next 2 are called Allegiant, parts 1&2. To refresh your memory, it takes place in the not too distant future of an enclosed Chicago-a big wall surrounds the city with barren wastelands surrounding them. People are divided into 5 groups, depending on an evaluation test given to them when they reach a certain age. The 5 groups are the intellectuals, the selfless, the warriors, the peace lovers and the totally honest-they have fancier names in the movie, such as the Erudite and the Dauntless, but you get the idea. Shailene is a young girl that does not fit into any one group and is therefore considered a Divergent, which is the name given to outcasts. Kate is in charge of the city and she does not like Divergents. In fact, she is always sending her soldiers out looking for Divergents. This installment starts right after the last one ended and everyone is looking for a mysterious box that has a hidden message inside it. Kate gets to it first but can not open it and discovers that she needs a Divergent to open the box-Hmmmm....I wonder who she has in mind for that job? Theo returns as Shailene's love interest and protector, for whenever she gets into a situation that she can't get out of by her self. Naomi is a new character and she plays the mother of Theo. Some of the better scenes are when Shailene is experimented on/tortured by Kate, which is shown as kind of like a dream reality involving flying buildings and her dead mother-it also gives Ashley Judd an excuse to show up, since she is the aforementioned dead mother. It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence, sexual situations-no nudity-and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 59 minutes. If you liked the first one, then you should like this one. It does have a little more action. I liked it enough that I would buy it on Blu-Ray.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
37,alindsay-al,A below average confusing sequel,4,23 July 2015,"I enjoyed the first divergent film so I actually had high hopes for the sequel insurgent but this film disappointed me and ended up being below average and one of the more forgettable movies of the year. The premise of the film sees the future where people are split into factions based on their abilities, but some don't fit into any factions and are called divergents. Tris, is one of these and the factions are looking for her to help unravel a mystery. Now shailene Woodley plays tris and just like the first film she is the best part of this film, she is a strong female protagonist who is damaged but you care about her and you like her and want her to succeed. Unfortunately the rest of the cast don't seem to care about there roles as much, Theo James plays her love interest four and he is a statue in this film filled with absolutely no emotion and you really don't care about him at all. The same thing can be said about jai Courtenay who is back in this film but is just a statue villain who has absolutely nothing about him. Kate Winslet is a good actress but she does absolutely nothing in this film and she was just a bland enemy for them to go against. Now the story in the first one was alright with good character development but this one is just all over the place. There is allot of plot points with way too much going on and it just goes know here and it similarly copies the first film. It feels like a really long movie and you realise that if you have not seen the first film you will be confused and wondering what people are talking about. The script is really bad and the dialogue just does absolutely nothing to help the performers or the audience to care about the characters. The style was really good I like post apocalyptic worlds and the action scenes were pretty good with some really good special effects. This is just a completely forgettable movie and I think it is below average and not worth your time.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
38,estebangonzalez10,"Bigger, Louder, but it doesn't necessarily mean it's better",4,21 March 2015,"""You are living proof that the divergent problem has grown beyond all control.""Director Robert Schwentke (RED, RIPD) replaced Neil Burger for the Divergent sequel which is much bigger, louder, and action packed. I actually ended up mildly recommending the first film which I found engaging enough thanks to Shailene Woodley's lead performance. Unfortunately, Insurgent is a step down for the franchise because bigger doesn't necessarily mean better. The action scenes look great and the film is very pretty to look at, but the main issue I have here is with the story which I felt was so convoluted that I wasn't able to engage with any of the characters. I honestly couldn't remember much of what had happened in Divergent (which means it didn't really make an impact on me the first time around), but we get enough flashbacks and exposition here to recall some of the important events. We are also introduced to the two other factions that the first one left out (amity and candid) so we get new characters that mostly appear on screen for a couple of minutes. Octavia Spencer is the leader of amity and Daniel Dae Kim of candid. Insurgent also introduces us to the factualness who are led by Naomi Watt's Evelyn. So Insurgent basically ha the same flaws most sequels do, which is try to make everything bigger and it ends up crowding the screenplay and leaving little room for character development. Sure, some of the action scenes are great (mostly the first couple of scenes) but I simply lost interest in the story and found it incredibly tedious and boring. By the end I didn't really care what could happen to any of the characters. I haven't had much luck with Schwentke's films recently and would've preferred Burger continued directing the franchise instead. If you are a fan of Veronica Roth's YA novels you probably will enjoy this, but I'm not familiar with her work and didn't enjoy this film at all. Insurgent takes place right after the events of Divergent so if you haven't watched the first film you might feel lost. Basically, the story is set in a dystopian future where society is divided into five factions based on people's virtues. Jeanine (Kate Winslet) is the head of the erudite (the intelligent faction) who basically has control over this wrecked city surrounded by giant walls which separate them from the vast outdoor wasteland. The heroine of the franchise is Tris (Shailene Woodley) who discovers she's divergent because she doesn't fit into one faction, but decides however she wants to be Dauntless (the more adventurous and fearless members of society who become the protectors of the city). Here she falls in love with Four (Theo James), befriends Christina (Zoe Kravitz), and is bullied by Peter (Miles Teller) and Eric (Jai Courtney) who are all returning characters in the sequel. In Divergent, Tris discovers that her kind isn't accepted in society believing they are a threat for not fitting in. She also discovers that Jeanine is planning on taking over the rest of the factions beginning with Abnegation which is where her parents (Tony Goldwyn and Ashley Judd) reside. Her parents are killed in the attack but she eventually stops Jeanine's plan. Insurgent picks up right after the attack as we follow the surviving fugitives hiding out with the Amity faction. Tris's brother, Caleb (Ansel Elgort) is also with them. Jeanine will stop at nothing to capture Tris discovering she's a valuable asset. The plot in insurgent felt much weaker and the film focuses mainly on the action sequences. There are way too many characters introduced, which is a shame because it diverts the attention at times from the main ones. Shailene Woodley gives a solid performance but she didn't carry the film this time around. I found her character a bit less charismatic since she spends most of the film feeling guilty and unable to forgive herself for the loss of her parents and friends. Theo James isn't any better either and the romantic chemistry that existed in the first film grows weak this time around. Ansel Elgort is devoid of all the charm he brought to the table in The Fault of Our Stars (it is weird seeing him play Woodley's sister in this film after being her love interest). My favorite performance in this sequel surprisingly came from Miles Teller who doesn't get much screen time but shines in the few scenes he's in. The villains aren't actually very menacing and everything about this sequel felt more boring and tedious to me. Even the simulation and dream sequences are a bit of a letdown and took me away from the film completely. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
39,mattkratz,average,7,3 March 2018,"This wasn't too bad a sequel to the Divergent movie as it mostly serves as an ""in between"" movie. Kind of like Back to the Future Part II. It relies mostly on action scenes and special effects. The lead actress's performance was good and the action scenes carried it pretty well but only so far. I liked it pretty well though. If you are a fan of the series and are curious, you might give it a try.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
40,r96sk,Not all that exciting,7,18 May 2020,"A much more boring affair than its predecessor, which isn't good given the latter's own issues. Of all my problems from 'Divergent', only the score improves here.Shailene Woodley's Tris is somehow a little unlikable in 'Insurgent', despite being the protagonist - many of her character motivations are a little up-and-down. Theo James (Four) is roughly the same, though Ansel Elgort's Caleb is utterly pointless; not helped by the filmmakers taking a strange direction with him.Miles Teller (Peter) gets more screen-time, not entirely sure why though - and that's coming from someone who is fine with him in the last production. Kate Winslet remains massively underused as the main villain, I don't connect with her at all.The premise in this second film of the series is underwhelming and not all that exciting, making use of the factionless is the right step but they don't exactly nail giving them a larger part.With all that said, I do actually like how this concludes. It should set up a strong third film. Right...? I'll soon find out! It is, so far, a missed opportunity of a franchise.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
41,kluseba,Conquering the genre throne and an impressive improvement over the first part,8,16 April 2015,"Since I'm a fan of dystopian movies, I decided to watch ''Insurgent'' even though its predecessor ''Divergent'' was quite shallow due to exchangeable actors, average effects, unimpressive locations and an ordinary story. The second part of the series came as a big surprise to me as nearly everything improved. ''Insurgent'' focuses just as much on a gripping and twisted story as on character development. The first part was overwhelmingly emotional and stereotypical at times and didn't have a strong story. This movie comes around with interesting ideas from start to finish. The acting has become more charismatic and mature. Shailene Woodley was an average actress with average looks in the first part but her acting feels more realistic and unique in the sequel. The film feels also more serious because there are more interesting adult actors than before, namely Daniel Dae Kim and Naomie Watts who deliver a solid job. Kate Winslet's acting as main villain is much colder and meaner than before and improved a lot as well.The effects have also improved but aren't overused in the movie. The different intense simulations the main character needs to go through are visually stunning. Only the three-dimensional effects could have been a little bit more present and didn't add much to the movie. The locations in this film aren't anything spectacular but they are all quite dark and oppressive. This movie's atmosphere is definitely more coherent and gripping than what we have seen in the first part.The ending is also quite promising. On one side, the story that has been built up over two movies comes to a satisfying end while another intriguing story starts that has already convinced me to go watch the last two parts. It's up to you to decide whether you stop following the series or continue watching it from here on while the first movie didn't give you that choice as it ended with some sort of cliffhanger in the middle of nowhere.In the end, both fans of the franchise and the genre and critics who didn't appreciated the flawed first part should give this movie a try. Despite the high amount of dystopian movies that have come out over the past twelve months, this film is easily the best of its kind and left the ''Maze Runner'' and the ''Hunger Games'' series behind.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
42,davispittman,Kate Winslet steals the show!,7,12 June 2016,"In Insurgent, the sequel to 2014's Divergent, the story picks up exactly where it left off. I very much enjoyed Divergent, and I was not let down or disappointed by Insurgent. This movie was not quite as good as its predecessor, but it certainly was NOT bad. The cast all returns here and they all do a great job filling their own roles. Kate Winslet blew me away in her portrayal of Jenine Matthews, she was so effortlessly evil and focused. Kate definitely stole the show in every scene she was in. Shailene Woodley of course was great here too! She was strong, resilient, focused, and above all, intense. Theo James was just as good here as he was before in the original, tough but tender, sweet, and handsome. Naomi Watts is a new addition to the Divergent Series cast, and she blends in quite well, dark hair and all. Miles Teller is just fine, and same for Ansel Elgort. The special effects are very top notch throughout, the CGI is so professional looking and doesn't appear fake at all. The action/violence is good and handled well too, it is not over the top or distasteful. The sensuality is here briefly, which I thought was done well, I actually would have preferred a longer scene of sensuality, to show four and tris and their love. This movie is entertaining and overall well done, but not incredible, and not quite as good as the first film in the series. 7/10 for Insurgent. Oh and the ending is pretty satisfactory.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
43,3xHCCH,Better Than the First,8,18 March 2015,"""Insurgent"" picks up right where the first film of this series ""Divergent"" left off. The tense peace inside the walls of dystopian Chicago is shattered when the Abnegation faction was invaded and destroyed. Tris and Four are rebels on the run, seeking refuge among the other factions. Ruthless Erudite leader Jeanine needs a perfect Divergent in order to unlock a certain box which contains an important message about their current existence, which Jeanine wants to suppress. This special Divergent is, of course, is Tris.The first film ""Divergent"" was a pretty good film interpretation of the book. I found this second film to be even better than the first film. I did not get to read the second book so I could not assess its faithfulness to the original material. We get to see better the rest of the other factions, like Amity (with Octavia Spencer as their leader Johanna), Candor (with Daniel Dae Kim as their leader Jack Kang), and the Factionless (with Naomi Watts as their leader Evelyn). I can see the same limitations of the first book here, especially with the unusual behavior and decisions of Tris, but hey, she is a special girl, the chosen one. I thought Shailene Woodley did very well to play Tris, with her guilty conscience, disturbing nightmares and the reluctance as a heroine. Theo James though is less noticeable here than before, as Four is seemingly relegated to be Tris' consort in this installment. Ansel Elgort looked very ill at ease and awkward in his scenes as Tris' confused younger brother Caleb. Making more of an impact were Miles Teller as the snake- like turncoat Peter and Jai Courtney as the vicious Dauntless officer Eric. Kate Winslet owns every scene she is in with her strong screen presence.A new director Robert Schwentke (known for previous mainstream hits like ""Flightplan"" and ""RED"") took over from Neil Burger (who directed ""Divergent""). Schwentke guides us through the criss-crossing web of events, building up effectively to the climactic five Faction simulation that Tris had to hurdle. The simulations in this film looked more sophisticated and complicated, with over-the-top visual effects, especially in that exciting Dauntless ""sim"" where Tris had to rescue her mom from a burning house hurtling in the air. This film is rated PG, but there are pretty intense violent scenes, including point-blank shooting of defenseless people, and a character pointing a gun at his temple. There was also a scene which had the young kids around me uncomfortably covering their eyes showing prolonged kissing between the leads, with clothes being removed.I think this film fully satisfies expectations for a second episode of a franchise. It was visually grand with mind-blowing special effects. It stands very well on its own, even if you have not yet seen the first film. It tells a complete story, with a defined resolution of events. It ends with a cliffhanger which makes you anticipate the next film. The last book in the series ""Allegiant"", in true Hollywood style, will again be split into two parts to make more money. Schwentke is already on board to direct Part 1, due out next year already. 8/10.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
44,drystyx,Great theatrics + zero motivation + no inspiration=,3,14 April 2015,"On the scale beloved by the geeks, this is a success, full of theatrics and drama with inane action.On a scale of Art, it's a failure. It will be hailed as grand by the extreme right wingers for whom this is a huge propaganda movie. I don't think it's very subtle, but those I watched the movie with were fooled, or so they say.It is great in theatrics and drama and action, but it's full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. I had to have the plot explained to me before I watched it, or I never would have understood it, and for good reason. There is no motivation for the theatrics, and no inspiration.This equals the look of a stolen idea, probably from a better story maker, but with a truly dangerous trend that publishers had to alter to fit their agenda. The idea that a person who can do many things, and has many skills, being ""picked on"" is used and abused by the publishers, producers, and elitists who want to keep ""underlings"" feeling that some people are ""demi god"" material, and should have all authority and stewardship.Had the story been the opposite, it would make sense, and at least had motivation, but there is no motivation here. The fact that great theatrics and drama and action are wasted on Republican propaganda that sets humanity and progress back decades at a time makes this worse than it would have been without the attention to fundamental film making.This story is the problem, and purports that only a few elitists should be able to do anything, and everyone else must be cannon fodder and not allowed to perform or have opportunity.

45,peterp-450-298716,At least this was a bit better than the first part ....,6,5 August 2015,"""Divergent 100%. I'll be damned. What? She's what we've been looking for."" I really start hating those damn different film versions of children's books. They are always spread over several films so you always have to wait a year before you can see the sequel. Similarly this sequel to ""Divergent"". I could still partially remember what it was about, but the first 15 minutes I was actually systematically trying to reconstruct the previous film. It would be best to watch the previous movie once again before you start a sequel. But then again this happens never due to the lack of time. And then, to know that the last part of the sequel is again divided into two films, and that for the obvious reasons. Let's hope that my biggest fear won't come true, namely that we'll be overwhelmed by serial-like movies in the future.Logically one makes a comparison with the similar series of films of ""The Hunger Games"". The first part of the latter was clearly way better than ""Divergent"". But ""Insurgent"" surpasses again the second part of ""The Hunger Games"" . I thought the latter was a faint duplicate of the first part. I had the tendency to check all the time to see if I hadn't started the wrong movie. ""Insurgent"" continues where the first part left off (quite logical, no?). It doesn't waste any time and soon it plunges itself into a series of thrilling action sequences. Tris (Shailene Woodley), Four (Theo James), Caleb (Ansel Elgort) and Peter (Miles Teller, who made a greater impression on me in ""Whiplash""), the least reliable gland of the group, were separated from the rest of Dauntless. This faction had to flee after Jeanine (Kate Winslet) started a coup during which she wanted to eradicate ""divergents"" (for those who didn't know, Tris is Divergent which allegedly means she could belong to any faction) because they constitute a threat for the peaceful society as it exists now. Meanwhile Jeanine's troops have found a mysterious device with all symbols of all factions printed on it. Seemingly it contains a message from the founders of the city and can only be opened by someone who can undergo all the simulations without dying. Guess twice who the lucky volunteer will be! Last year I said to myself not to watch the next parts of this series because it was so predictable and because of the teenage girl content. Well, you can see I gave in but no regrets this time. Yet only a few remarks. The uncomplicated way Tris could create such a trendy, modern styled haircut without a mirror and with a primitive-looking scissors (looks like an illustration from a glossy magazine which you can find on the table at your local hairdresser), even stunned my wife with a marveled reaction as a result. This will be the new hair style this summer, I guess. Then it occurred to me again that nobody can get on or off a train in a typical manner. And then there is the thrilling fact that seemingly without much effort (they are massively sought and still they can stroll around everywhere calmly) they are being overpowered, after which suddenly they are again liberated. And then of course the obligatory lovescenes are present as well.But otherwise, this film is filled with action and the CGI is at times unprecedented that'll take your breath away. Especially the simulations looked amazing and detailed (especially the house floating through the air). The fact that you didn't know whether it was real or a simulated situation became a bit monotonous. But the film went on at a furious pace so you won't be bored for a minute. It's a certainty that I'll be watching the last part as well although I'll probably be p*ssed because of them making 2 films out of it. The end result will surely be two quite largely stretched-out parts.More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT",The Divergent Series - Insurgent

I don't know if it's just Shailene Woodley or if it's the direction and script too. It's difficult to see what Four sees in her.There's still the same 'Hunger Games' thing going on, but it seems like they've tried to make it as different as they can with the story at least. And it is slightly better than the first, probably because they don't have to spend so long setting the scene and establishing the characters. I did read somewhere that it doesn't follow the book as closely as the first, perhaps that is why it comes across a bit better?Naomi Watts seems a tad young to be playing Four's mother or perhaps he was already too old when he was cast in the first one, but either way, their interaction feels more like past lovers reunited than Mother and Son.I'm not writing this series of films off, although 'The Hunger Games' would be my first choice for a teenage trials film series.

48,Seraphion,A different mood from Divergent,6,22 March 2015,"Continuing the story from Divergent, Four and Tris, with Marcus, Peter and Caleb hides within the Amity's residences. It's not long until Max and Eric bring men under Jeanine in search for them. Peter snitch on the group so Tris, Four and Caleb run and they catch a train back to the city. After a fight against faction-less men in the train, Four reveals his Abnegration identity and they lead them to their faction-less leader, Four's mother Evelyn, who's been hiding from Marcus. Evelyn informs them about the location of Christina and the rest of the Dauntless within the Candor building. Meanwhile Jeanine has found a box claimed to contain a message from the city's founders, which can only be opened by a Divergent. As Tris and Four head to Candor, Caleb separates parts, saying he's going back to Abnegation. At Candor Tris and Four meet Christina, Tori and the rest of the Dauntless. But the Candor leader is strict and Tris and Four are to be taken to trial at the Faction Council. Four reasons his way out gaining instead a trial within Candor, under influence of Candor's truth serum. Under the serum Four admits he was going to leave Dauntless but he fell in love with Tris and stayed to protect her. On the other hand Tris admits about Will. At night when Four is out, Eric and Max attack the Candor building, putting to sleep many people with a new serum. Those who don't go down are tested and proved to be Divergents. Eric plans to find a 100% Divergent for Jeanine's test subject and kill the rest of them. He finds out that Tris is one, but Four and the rest of the Dauntless turns the table, executing Eric at the end. Four and Tris returns to Evelyn, reluctantly agreeing to her way of attacking Jeanine and he Erudite head on. But as they prepare, Jeanine activates the implants on the Dauntless, implanted on the Candor siege, controlling the Dauntless subconsciously and threatening suicides until Tris is surrendered. Tris sneaks out of the faction-less' hideout and surrender herself to Jeanine, who then has her undergo the five faction simulation to open the message box. Tris passes the Dauntless sim by saving her mother, the Candor sim by being truthful to her mother, the Abnegation sim by sparing Peter's life from her vengeance, and also the Erudite sim by figuring out that she's not really out of the sim yet. Jeanine rests her when she sees Tris is exhausted. The next day Peter shows Tris that Four is captured trying to rescue her. She went ballistic but Peter jacks her up with a drug that calms her. Tris fails to pass the last Amity sim due to attacking Jeanine in the sim. She goes unconscious and Jeanine orders the Erudite to find another strong Divergent and orders Peter to dispose of Tris. Peter brings Tris to Four and tricks the cell guards to free Four and wakes up Tris. As they make escape, Tris instead insists to stay and finish the Amity sim to open the box in honor of her parents. Tris passes the sim by resisting to attack her doppelganger. The message reveals that instead the Divergents are the solution as the faction system is actually an experiment and that there are other people beyond the fence. Jeanie orders to silence the message and every witness. But Evelyn and the Dauntless-faction-less army storms the place saving the situation. The message is then broadcast to every monitor in the city.The story nicely feels a notch or two improvements compared to the first movie. But if we compared to other similar stories, especially to The Hunger Games saga with the similarly female lead, the transition from Divergent to Insurgent doesn't really have the feel of urgency within the movie's mood. Comparably, the mood change from suspicious to alerted is stronger in the transition between Catching Fire to Mockingjay Part 1. On the other hand Insurgent still has the movie fluctuates to many times from the thrilling confrontations to the calmer dialog between characters scenes.The overall world and background depiction somehow feels reduced from what's shown in Divergent. The absence of the powerful and age relate- able soundtracks at major incidents really strengthened this image. I didn't remember any good song from Insurgent, while I at least remembered the Emmy Rossum styled tunes from Divergent.This time in the series, this movie focuses more on the story and drama. We get served a lot of intrigues, revelations, truthful confrontations, and even double turncoats. We get less action and stunts here, although the ones that are shown aren't bad at all. I like the earlier stunt of the railway jump. But it sure shows that this movie lacks good fight scenes, which we see quite a plenty in Divergent.The acting overall for me is still at the same level with Divergent. It's quite nice that Shailene Woodley and Theo James manages to reprise their lead roles here. Miles Teller and Ansel Elgort nicely keep their characters from Divergent, enough for the later surprises near the end. It's funny to note that all the significant male actors here; James, Teller and Elgort; has been paired with Shailene Woodley in other movies and all of them had kissed her. This makes the scene after Peter frees Four feels very funny to me.A 6 out of 10 score is what I give to Insurgent (2015). A recommendation is a yes from me. The movie is entertaining for me, and since I like to follow about long movie sagas, I think Insurgent is a must watch to continue on what we saw in Divergent (2014).",The Divergent Series - Insurgent

Yeah I've heard that line before, so naturally I've been sent to scope it out. As always, what might the trailers have you expect:  A movie that sticks close to the book  Action sequences that are exciting  Dramatic dialogue that will bring memorable quotes  Well edited shots and scenes. So what did I get from this movie that the trailers made look so good. 1. When it comes to following the book, Insurgent only loosely captures the complex infrastructure the novel set up. Most of the important plot elements are portrayed, while neglecting some of the specifics. The real element this film leaves out is the involvement of the other characters, and the important relationships pertinent to the story. Many of the divergent faction appear briefly, throwing out a few lines before they blend into the background with the other gun-toting rebels. Fans of the series will be disappointed to find key players in this second tale reduced to mere backstory, effectively removing their influence in the tale. Many of the story elements lacked emotional depth, the big revelations and twists not that engaging for me. Also a few parts were ambiguous, left unanswered or unexplained that left me scratching my head. I think the main reason for this was because of the missing details from the story, many if included would have probably made for more excitement. 2. Another factor that failed for me was the action. The trailers called this tale action packed, with excitement in every moment. Big shock, this emphasis is a lie. When there are action moments they can be good, the train battle in the beginning was the kind of excitement I liked. However, most of the battles are brief skirmishes, with fake looking guns firing aimlessly as the bad guys surprisingly lack any skills. A few hand to hand combat moves helped relieve some of the mindless shooting, but not enough for me to agree with the promises the trailer made. What is the positive side of this? Well it means your preteens and young audience members won't have to worry about too much violence, always a plus in my book. I can also say that the action pretty much had a purpose in this movie too, rather than just putting the fight in for no reason. Thus, despite the action promised in the trailers, Insurgence did not provide the adrenaline rush I thought it would3. Instead of action, the bulk of the movie is over dramatic dialog and lots of talking between two attractive actors. While the book does have a lot of drama, it at least gives enough drive and deception to keep you guessing at what will happen next. In the movie that wasn't the case. A lot of the tone was very flat, only diverging from bland when anger escaped in bouts of screaming. The exception to the rule would be the dialog between Tris and Jeanine, which has enough zest and ire that symbolizes their relationship. Again not the best emotion, as Tris continues to suppress her anger and guilt. Yeah there are a few sappy moments that might jerk some tears from you, but this movie was a bit too monotone for me. Luckily the dialog has some mix of planning and backstory to help dilute the rather lackluster emotion they seem to show. 4. One main strength of this movie is the editing involved bringing this world to life. The costumes and settings are a combination of computer generated images and detailed set work. I'm impressed with their work and found the integration of the actors in the movie both realistic and well animated. Sure a few of the scenes were obviously fake, the floating room in the trailer being one moment where CGI wasn't completely detailed. However, the superior technology and warfare were creatively visualized and portrayed from the book.. It is just unfortunate that more of the book could have been adapted, but then again this might have led to an incredibly long movie, or even worse a second part. I think audience members will feel apart of the dystopia that is this story, and will become immersed in the setting.5. As a bonus point we'll quickly talk about the acting. Shailene Woodley leads the assemble in this tale and she does a decent job. She doesn't have as much emotion as her other roles, but her cries and screams are quite funny at times. Theo James as Four definitely brings eye candy to the role, as well as the rogue attitude that girls fall for. However, he too falls into one emotion, only breaking the mold when he has to get angry. Then there is Kate Winslet who played the superiority role to the letter. I hated her character, wanting to punch Jeanine in the face multiple times before the film was over. I found her a perfect casting for the role. Overall this movie is okay, but it's deviation from the relationships in the novel left the film lacking in plot elements. While the dialog is great for drama lovers, and some big points are there, the lack of action, pace, and dramatic flare dulled the shine I hoped it would have. My opinion the first movie is better, but chances are you will still see this movie in theaters. Worth a trip to theater? I would say yes for the effects, but for quality better left to home watching. My scores:Action/Sci-Fi/Thriller: 7.0 Movie Overall: 6.0",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
50,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,Story is a step down from that of Divergent (2014),5,31 July 2015,"Revolutions are not uncommon among societies. It is littered through recorded history and proves that when people become defiant enough about their situation, they will do something to change it. The change however that goes about may not be peaceful or violent. It all depends on how the people who want to change the situation think is the best way to do it. Another key thing to remember is that when people have a revolution it is because their eyes are opened up to the truth (and most of the time, the truth hurts). When Divergent (2014) arrived, it did not have the strongest of action sequences or strikingly recognizable music but its characters were well written, had distinguishable personalities and a story that was different from most eutopian Earth settings. The most unique trait about the story was that the society was separated by factions according to personality but if someone matched all of them, they were considered a ""divergent""; a danger to society.After learning herself that Tris (Shailene Woodley) was one herself, she originally fled to try and stay out of trouble. Later on though after meeting new friends and gaining confidence, she turned around and decided to fight back against Jeanine (Kate Winslet), the head of all control. The story line to this sequel is where it leaves off. However, even with all writers from Divergent (2014) being replaced and throwing in an extra writer didn't seem to add any depth. There are more explanations but not all of it makes sense either. Audiences will now learn that Jeanine has a box from the outside society's protective walls that if unlocked, will tell the secret to destroying all divergents. The only way to unlock this box is by having a divergent person pass its mental test, which is no cakewalk. The mental test is so difficult many have died, but Jeanine won't stop until she finds the right person to open it. Yeah but if Jeanine is killing divergent people in the process, isn't she kind of getting what she wants anyway? It sounds like she's making this more complex than it needs to be.Another threat is also the addition of devices that'll immediately tell Jeanine's head cronies Eric (Jai Courtney) and Max (Mekhi Phifer) who is 100% divergent. So now people have percentages of divergent in them? From what Divergent (2014) stated, it sounded like if you were divergent, you were divergent - not 30% or 95% divergent. Let's be consistent please. Besides the confusing continuity and nonsensical plot device, the execution is mostly predictable as well, which isn't the best. This specifically pertains to the revolution where Tris ends up meeting Four's (Theo James) mother Evelyn (Naomi Watts) who wants to fight back against Jeanine as well. Although not as prevalent as before, character development still exists. There are still appearances by the original cast - Octavia Spencer, Tony Goldwyn, Zoë Kravitz, Ray Stevenson, Ashley Judd, Ansel Elgort and Miles Teller. The acting thankfully saves some of the quality to the characters. All actors can perform the right emotion for the right scene.Again other than main characters, Jai Courtney looked like he had the most fun in his role being an utter jerk yet one who enjoys his job. In fact, it's a bit deceiving because at one point during this series, the role of Eric could've developed into something more. This is not the case however, for the writers took a more predictable route. One aspect of the film that was ramped up compared to Divergent (2014) were the special effects. The look of them are polished enough to look real but what was creative the most were in box mental tests. Not all were inventive but for the parts that were, it was impressive. The action however still wasn't anything that was attention grabbing. Much of it was the usual shootout between divergents and the people trying to capture them.On the upside the cinematography by Florian Ballhaus (The Devil Wears Prada (2006), RED (2010), Mr. Popper's Penguins (2011)) was well shot. Although Divergent (2014) also had wide panning shots of scenery, Ballhaus tended to get even more that not only included more shots of the city but also other landscapes. All of it is steady and clearly visible. However, there is one missing signature camera trick and that's the ultra-zoom shot mastered by director Robert Schwentke. It's fine that this action/fantasy film doesn't have action sequences like Schwentke's previous work like R.I.P.D. (2013) & RED (2010), but he still could have at least used his ultra-zoom shots. They're smooth, quick and they make the action feel more energetic. Other than that, Ballhaus' work gets an approval. The film score composed Joseph Trapanese was fairly reminiscent of Junkie XL/Hans Zimmer iterations but it didn't exactly emote the proper emotions when needed. Sometimes it felt like a track was going somewhere but it wasn't engaging enough. Plus, no reoccurring theme for the franchise? Let's go people.It is still watchable to a point with its occasionally creative special effects, decent acting and lovely looking cinematography, but that's it. The action is still rather uneventful, the continuity isn't recognized, the music remains anonymous sounding and the story itself is fairly predictable along with an overly complicated plot device.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
51,raulfaust,Tris Four and The Deathly Hallows,6,25 March 2015,"Well, ""Insurgent"" is a film expected by a lot of people, and considering my friends are all about this franchise, I went to see it last night with a date (or a spouse?) and I don't regret it. The main premise is very simple: when you think that the problems solved in the first installment were over and you could live your life peacefully, some horrible people come into your way and try to inject some misery in it. I know I've already said it in my ""Divergent""'s review, but it's impossible not to notice: this saga is VERY Harry Potter. In this installment, the powerful ""Voldemort"" (Jeanine) is coming back to bring the destruction, and the main teen couple, ""Harry"" (Four) and ""Hermione (Tris) are those who are going to save the day. That being said, I feel right to state that this whole story is pretty teen, so adult people are most likely to depreciate it. However, ""Insurgent"" is a movie that entertains for most of the time, and as long as you admire the characters like I did, you're probably going to enjoy the beautiful ending that we're given. Be aware of what you're going see to avoid disappointments.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
52,rannynm,"Intense, Action-packed and Touching",9,19 March 2015,"This second installment of the Divergent series is an action packed film with a great display of emotions from the entire cast. It's intense and, at times, a little touching. I truly enjoyed viewing it.War is now full-fledged between the Factions. Tris (Shailene Woodley), as a Divergent, has to continue to battle the guilt of her past shame and her enemies while trying to figure out who her true allies are. Many secrets are uncovered and trust is indeed tested between everyone. Insurgent is filled with great scenes that will keep you on the edge of your seat and your eyes glued to the big screen. The little sparks of pure creativity in presenting this adaptation is refreshing and satisfying with the CGI, stunts and different camera angles. My favorite character is Tobias (Theo James), aka Four. I can clearly see how much he loves and wants to protect Tris. His eyes tell the whole story of how much he cares and truly adores her. Even though some of the decisions aren't the best, he still stands by her. There are a ton of great scenes in Insurgent. However, my favorite scene is when Tris finds herself connected to one of Jeanine Matthew's (Kate Winslet) simulators. The cinematography and the special effects are outstanding and Shailene Woodley's acting in this scene is phenomenal. I loved seeing it in IMAX. The picture is definitely bigger, has higher quality and the sound is all around me, feeling so real. Insurgent also stars Jai Courtney (Eric), Ansel Elgort (Caleb) and Octavia Spencer (Johanna). They embody their characters fully and their acting performances are truly incredible. They really feed off of one another and look so natural. Insurgent has a strong message about choices. The choices you make affects what will happen later in your life, so you should always try to make the right choice. You can make the wrong choice or the right one, but either one has a consequence.I recommend this film for ages 13 to 18. It's rated PG -13 for some intense violence and heavy action throughout the film. I give Insurgent 5 out of 5 stars. It's action packed, easy to follow along and a joy to watch with all the special effects.Make the right choice and see Insurgent in theaters on March 20th, so please check it out.Reviewed by Brianna Hope B., KIDS FIRST!

53,Rob_Taylor,"The only ""surge"" in Insurgent, was towards the exit. Awful!",4,21 August 2015,"So, I was going to write up a review, but really, how much writing do you need to say a movie is a prize turkey? Instead, I'll copy and paste the notes I made whilst watching this thing. They occur in order, as I viewed the movie, which took me two sittings because it was so dull. So here goes:Notes made whilst I watched this turkey:Shailene Woodley still fails to convince that she is tough. Instead, she comes across as a woman having a really bad period.Jai Courtney looks like an especially wooden Biff Tannen from Back to the Future.In the future, trains have to run on four rails, not two. Why? Also, there are few older people in this dystopia. I know it's a young adult dystopia, but this is just silly.When under truth serum, it is necessary to ask unimportant questions because ""plot"".Kate Winslett somehow manages to overact her ""bitch"" role ludicrously.Scary death-slide ninja from nowhere! Scary death-slide ninja shoot as well as stormtroopers. Ninja have goggles!Testosterone showdown! Biff loses! Best part of the movie so far! Jai Courtney gets murdered.Jesus. Still an hour to go...Eriadite? Isn't the word Erudite? Airudite? Can anyone pronounce it correctly?Ooh! Blonde girl faceplants the concrete from fifty feet.Man, so much Nothing going on in this movie it's like it is a long-lost follow-on to the Never Ending Story.Yay! She got laid. Maybe now she won't be such a bitch. Oh no... noble self-sacrifice incoming. ZzzzzWow. Triss looks as bored of this movie as I am.""You can take the girl out of Abnegation, but you can't take Abnegation out of the girl."" Really? Who thought that was a good line?What a surprise, Peter learns being an evil henchman means being expendable.Interminable drivel is the best way of describing this so far.Magic fibre-optic cables! Wonder if having eight was a deliberate move on their part?Now we're into magic Matrix land with a flying house. A flying, burning house, no less! Triss is now having an emotional moment with someone that does not exist. ...and..... we're back in the room...or are we? and again with the Eriudite... or was it Areadite?So...the box is a message from the founders, only to be opened in the event of the faction system breaking down, and the only person that can open it, is a Divergent? (i.e. someone outside of the factions). I'm thinking the message may not be what bitch-queen Kate Winslett wants to hear.Triss now sporting a Yahoo Serious hairstyle. And next scene it is back to normal. Good continuity there. Eriudite...aagh! Is it really that hard to pronounce? More poor-man's Matrix nonsense. I swear if someone starts calling her ""The One""..... Goddammit! Winslett says ""I really thought you were the One."" Could this movie rip-off The Matrix any more? Maybe they'll be a rave? Triss is dead! Yay! Roll credits...oh wait...there's more... She's not dead...Whooo! Quelle surprise. Peter...the incredible allegiance-changing man.Oh look, just in time for the ""final battle (tm)"" they get the control devices out of everyone. What luck!I miss Biff Courtney. He died too early. There, I said it. I miss Jai Courtnay. This movie is real bad.Good Triss vs. Bad Triss. The message wasn't Soylent Green is people. I'm disappointed. But it is bad news for Kate. Cue scenes with people running for the wall! I'm guessing it isn't going to be that simple.Last scene execution of Kate. What a relief... for Kate Winslett. Now she won't have to do another one! The end. No rave, but some spiffy music!There you have it folks. Insurgent. A movie too dull to do more than post my notes for. Actually, my notes make it sound more interesting than it was. I think I was desperately trying to inject some life into what I was seeing. Trust me when I say, it is direly tedious to sit through. The first one was bad, but this is just mind-numbingly boring.SUMMARY: The movie equivalent of a tumbleweed blowing across an empty plain. Devoid of life, energy and excitement. Avoid at all costs.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent

55,denis888,"A Weaker Sequwl To Divergent, Because It Is More Predictable",6,20 July 2015,"Yes, this is so - this movie is not bad at all, but it is just a bit more predictable and more similar to those that many critics compared this Roth's adaptation with. I never read Veronica Roth's books and can judge the film only. This part is a bit shorter than Divergent, but it is also slower far too often, and all those huge video effects are welcoming, but seemingly too too much. They divert attention from something more important. What is the message? You got that? I was a bit dazzled by the finale of the film. Yes, there'll be 2 more parts, and I am not so deadly sure they will that good, either, but time will tell. The movie itself leaves the same weak spots - underdeveloped characters, some plot holes, excessive dialogs, excessive violence with no real validity. There are some huge goofs, too and they keep me from paying more attention to the plot. Shailene Woodley as Beatrice ""Tris"" Prior and Theo James as Tobias ""Four"" Eaton did a cool job, though I was so wholly impressed by their relations. One thing I could not shake off all the time was that vague sense of teenage audience targeting in this film, as it never raised on to a more mature or deeper level, sometimes leaving the smack of some strong but not superb comic book. Daniel Dae Kim as Jack Kang and Ashley Judd as Natalie Prior were seemingly nice addition to the cast, but they have not left a more lasting impression, and this unshakable feeling of some surface swimming and too hasty depiction never let go. My advice - yeah, sure watch this, too. It is not bad, it is just not overtly great, just solidly OK.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent

57,PartialMovieViewer,Worth It,10,27 April 2015,"I really enjoyed this fast paced action adventure. Non-stop excitement and an actual storyline...very rare qualities in these times. Oh, and what an excellent cast. Shailene Woodley and Theo James are brilliant together. I see them as a very balanced team and both are smart at their craft. The rest of the crew were outstanding as well, each and every one. I was particularly impressed by Kate Winslet...she is such a talented actor. It seems very easy to be a good 'guy' and be liked all the time, but an actor's true chops are exposed playing the villain. The story is fast paced jammed full of necessary action. I'm not a big fan of CGI and special affects - but these spellbinding additions were so skillfully melded into to the story - they did not overshadow the importance of the actors or take anything from the story. Masterfully directed...this movie delivers the whole package. Unlike many other flicks, I did not get a sense that I was to be bombarded with money- grubbing sequel after sequel.

60,khanbaliq2,A serviceable adaptation of the book with a surprisingly effective ending.,5,3 June 2015,"I wasn't really excited to see Insurgent, but since my girlfriend wanted to see it I went along with her. I've seen Divergent last year and thought that it's a fine science fiction adventure film for young adults. Though there was too much fighting and too many guns for my taste. Insurgent begins three days after the previous installment and immediately seems like a more entertaining film. That's because it's not burdened by exposition describing what the world is like in this series. There's also more action, something that helps to keep momentum until the thrilling ending. This is again a story about Tris Prior (Shailene Woodley) and her fight against Jeanine (Kate Winslet) and the rest of Erudite. In this difficult struggle she gets help from her boyfriend Four (Theo James), who's really just about every girl's dream man. This time around Woodley shows that she's a very good actress by providing Tris with a considerable amount of depth. There's a reason why the trailers for this film featured footage from the ending. The ending is easily the most compelling part of the film. That's when the science fiction elements come into play. That's when the CGI is used to good effect for the simulations, which are reminiscent of some of the best parts of The Matrix (1999). That's when there are dramatic scenes that truly leave viewers in wonder. In fact, watching the ending of Insurgent was the best time I've had in a movie theater this year before I watched Mad Max: Fury Road. But Insurgent is no Fury Road, and unless you're familiar with the world of this series by author Veronica Roth you won't get much enjoyment out of watching this film. So, do I recommend it? Yes, I recommend Insurgent. You get to see Woodley, James, Zoe Kravitz and Miles Teller on screen, along with accomplished actors Kate Winslet, Naomi Watts and Ashley Judd. The film was scored well by Joseph Trapanese. The CGI is used to good effect in the film's impressive visuals. Sure, Insurgent treads water for the majority of its running time, and the concept of this dystopia story is near ridiculous. However, there's some interesting science fiction on display in addition to the action.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent

Jeanine obtains a prophecy that can only be read by Divergents. Jeanine will stop at nothing to capture all Divergents & find out what the prophecy has to say. Now, it is up to Tris & Four to stop Jeanine & put an end to her reign of terror. Insurgent is a brilliant movie. This film surpasses its predecessor in every way. The special effects are mind blowing. I loved the fact that the movie is in 3D. The 3D is totally worth it. This film had me on the edge of my seat throughout. Unless you have read the books, you really can't predict what's going to happen next. Shailene Woodley is excellent as Tris. Woodley portrays Tris' inner struggle with her emotions, flawlessly. Theo James is great as Four. Ansel Elgort is super as Caleb. Miles Teller is outstanding as Peter. I really wish Teller's character was given more screen time. Zoe Kravitz is impressive as Christina. Octavia Spencer is good as Johanna. Daniel Dae Kim is awesome as Jack Kang. Naomi Watts' talent is wasted in her miniature role as Evelyn. Mekhi Phifer is effective as Max.

62,fernandoschiavi,"Schwentke prefers to focus on the dizzying visual effects, but the objective involving discoveries and revenge works as the main focus for the evolution of the script",6,13 March 2021,"In the first film Tris (Shailene Woodley) transforms, as in the passage from childhood to puberty. In Insurgent, he deals with one of the greatest difficulties of maturation: acceptance of himself. With features from all factions - Candor (the honest), Abnegation (the altruistic), Dauntless (the brave), Amity (the peaceful) and Scholar (the intelligent) - it doesn't fit anywhere and thinks its existence is a disservice to the world. Rebellion is the great message of the franchise. In his existential crisis, the teenager discovers that he does not need to accept the rules imposed by the world, he does not need to limit his existence to outdated values. With Tris and her self-questions at the center, the public that still seeks the paths of cultural and sexual liberation finds a voice. Discover that you are special, no matter what others say.The impact of the violence, unlike what happened in the past film, is transmitted to the public and felt on screen in a powerful way - especially by Tris -, with some emotionally charged deaths, conducted efficiently by Schwentke. Visually, the feature has also evolved considerably, featuring good special effects and a more functional production design. Insurgent develops in a very linear way, without surprises or major revelations. First of all, it must be kept in mind that this is an intermediate sequence - it is the adaptation of the second book of a trilogy - and, as it usually happens in these cases, there is no clear beginning, much less a satisfactory conclusion. Just as we entered the story in a bit of a fright - those who did not watch the previous feature will certainly be lost - there is also nothing to be explained at the end, leaving the necessary links for the following chapters.In the cast, Shailene Woodley remains primarily responsible for making this story believable and exciting. The young actress builds a remarkable evolution of the character, gradually moving between indignation and action, love and hate. Without the subtlety of her expressions, scenes like Tris facing herself could seem a little comical. Ansel Elgort and Miles Teller gain ambiguous contours, more interesting than in the previous film, but the justification for their changes in attitude is too simple and too fast, compromising the coherence of their characters. Theo James, again, is the weak link in the middle of the good cast. At least his character becomes a mere helper to the female protagonist, reversing the prevailing macho logic in action films.Octavia Spencer and Daniel Dae Kim do very well in their short but important scenes for the plot. The choice of Naomi Watts is questionable for the role of a rebel leader of the factionless. Due to the short explanation of her past, the talented actress can do little to make the character more complex. Kate Winslet is sadly underutilized: it is quite an affront to choose an actress of this level for such a shallow role, limited geographically to a single room, with the same gestures. Winslet could easily turn Jeanine into an extremely evil and perverse villain, but she prefers to keep her more restrained, human, and perhaps for that very reason a little monotonous.This ill-conceived justification for the character Caleb's arc, by the way, is one of several points that do not make sense in this continuation, affecting central elements of the plot and some events of the plot, completely undermining the rest of the production. It is difficult to swallow the mystery of the box - which lasts until the end of production - when Ray Stevensson's character practically begs to explain what is happening to the heroes - and to the audience. Of course, like any project involving the genre, Insurgent is also full of betrayals and surprises in the course of it. However, the title is very damaged due to its oscillations between shelters, searches for an army and revelations. Little by little, he enters this great roller coaster of moments, gaining prominence in some points and showing weaknesses in so many others.Even so, there is still that tension in the air through certain events and even more when it moves towards its final stretch and the decisions of its protagonist. The objective of opening the box found is also clear throughout the script, but it provides less impact than it should with the introduction of such an object. The existence of the box itself and the reasons for Jeanine's search for opening it also borders on the absurd, being a nonsense that an object that would bring about the end of the divergent could only be opened by a divergent - which, in turn, implodes the ""learned"" stance of the antagonist interpreted by Winslet. Crowning this festival of silliness, the film ends in an ""apotheosis"" revelation.It is also worth mentioning that, even with great differences in the book for its adaptation, the objective involving discoveries and revenge works as the main focus for the evolution of the script. Jeanine seeks answers and ways to end the Divergent out of fear and her ambition for power, while Tris wants to eliminate the person responsible for the death of her parents and an entire faction, as well as trying to prove her innocence. However, the most interesting thing is when the meetings take place and this presents a new path through a major turnaround, introducing answers and new questions to show the beginning of an unexpected situation. Mysteries remain in the air, as well as the expectation for the completion of the film series.Insurgent is very similar to its predecessor, especially in its problems. The plot, which was already shallow in the first film, here continues the same way, carrying all the problems caused and accumulated in Divergent. The weak connections between the characters, the lack of motivation and the lack of chemistry between the main couple are even more prominent here. For those who know the books it is even worse, because the lack of care is very clear. An example is the relationship between Tris and Christina (Zoë Kravitz), which goes through ups and downs, but in the film it is demonstrated in a very superficial way, without a minimum development after some important events.
As for the pace, there are some good moments that take the film up, especially in combat scenes, such as the invasions of Scholarly Friendship and Frankness or the fight on the train, which carry a welcome tension for the audience, but in others there is a waste of time. Some scenes in which we accompany Tris in his simulations and dreams are too long for a short objective. The impression it gives is that they were filmed to show the visual potential of the film, which, as stated above, is weak. These scenes are even more problematic due to a simplistic visual effects work, without much finishing.On the technical side, all the producers' attention seems to have been turned to the visual effects show. There is an ostentatious amount of CGI, with action scenes created digitally and projected on green screens. The scenarios of the simulations are grandiose, but at the same time not very creative - after all, suspended buildings, ruined buildings and cables connected to the characters' bodies are not exactly a novelty in the genre. Despite the conventional aspect, this sequence presents a greater production than that of Divergent, with a more refined visual and intelligent use of 3D, exploring the depth of field and making the action scenes (such as the invasion at the top of the building) more exciting. .Divergent was a shallow film, which barely presented the universe of the saga, and Insurgent made the same mistakes at a time when everything should be settled. The ending is one of the few most exciting moments in the film, not least because it is where we see the track and visuals working better and in sync. Something in common that these teen sagas have is to increase their ambitions and grandiosity with each continuation, guaranteeing a renewed interest from fans and the curious. Robert Schwentke, who takes over as Neil Burger, leaves aside the most daring choices of his precursor and invests only in the guaranteed. At least, Insurgent maintains the option of privileging women in command positions. Tris is not demure and passive, like certain heroines in love with other adaptations of teenage books. She takes the initiative, shooting, jumping, jumping, having sexual desire and a warrior fury that goes beyond the simple urge to do justice. The roadmap also includes, albeit quickly, a discussion of how social minorities are treated in undemocratic societies and are made to feel guilty about social ills. It cannot be forgotten that the divergent is a metaphor for the different and minority citizen (fat, gay, black, disabled, weird, as you prefer), transformed here into an essential superhero for the maintenance of social balance.Schwentke prefers to focus his attention on the dizzying visual effects. Good actors wander through explosions, glass prisons and old world ruins, without ever connecting with the scenery and the cold colors that surround them. The fight scenes, like the moment on the train, are impressive and functional to describe the character's physical and mental strength. Tris resembles a superheroine - and tests, in this sense, do nothing more than prove her superpowers. In the eyes of its target audience, Insurgent works, with lessons in resistance, overcoming and acceptance. For those who have reached maturity, however, two hours in the cinema need more than self-help messages to gain meaning.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent

64,MihaiSorinToma,A good sequel which could have been on par with its predecessor,8,6 June 2018,"After the events from the first movie, we follow Tris as she is left scarred from the past events, having more and more nightmares. Once a new hidden box is found by Jeanine, which allegedly contains a message from the ancestors but only a Divergent can open it, a new confrontation is about to emerge. Together with some new allies, Tris and Four must fight once again in an attempt to stop Jeanine.It's a good continuation of the events from the first instalment which presents the two protagonists as they face an apparently new threat from a recent enemy. We're about to see once again plenty of action, emotion and drama, but also unexpected changes and turnovers, all blended in superb CGI. A significant difference from its predecessor is the fact that it tends to focus much more on the emotional part. It insists to present in detail parts of the story which don't involve much action, thus making the first half a bit slow and sometimes dull. Think of it as a somewhat different approach regarding the main plot, which it's up to you to judge if it's for better or worse. From my point of view, it is a bit of a let-down.I was once again impressed by the CGI and the simulations which were top notch in terms of story and implementation, which, with a couple of unexpected characters, managed to introduce something new, something pleasant for the viewer. Unfortunately, not the same can be said about the rest of the movie, which had an overall tendency of lowering the impact which the first movie had. It isn't as impressive as the other one, it isn't as suspenseful and as emotional. You still get to care for the main characters, but this is mostly due to the first instalment. It does little to improve their contribution, and together with the drop in action, you get a noticeable change in the end.I'm not saying that it's a bad movie. No sir. It's just that I had the same expectations from the sequel as I had from its predecessor and this is mostly why I got a bit disappointed. I enjoyed it, I like its story and especially its finale, which once again left room for a sequel, while the special effects are great. I'm just upset that it could have been a better movie and it should have been.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent

I found it to be very intriguing and fun. The action is great and leaves you on the edge of your seat. The acting is very good, especially from Shailene Woodley, Ansel Elgort, Theo James, Miles Teller, Kate Winslet, and Naomi Watts. The characters are developed well in this movie as the story progresses. The only part of the movie that was dragged was the scene with Tris and Kate Winslet. It felt like too much was shown of that when it wasn't needed.

68,billygoat1071,Flashy Cover Up,5,18 March 2015,"Last year's Divergent was a film that not even its skilled director or high ambitions could fix the problems of its source material. The sequel, Insurgent, is a way different movie, since it's now handled by someone who is known for stylishly dumb action films. The film has gone to that same direction as well. It can be both a good and a bad thing; it elevates the entertainment value, but also leads to a lot of ridiculous ideas. It's quite hard to call it a better film since it has lost the intriguing flavor of its predecessor, but many would call it more fun, but the YA genre has its own way of appreciating its viewers and this straightforward action movie approach would hardly be described as anything more than an impressive spectacle for these movies.For its credit, this movie has more plot than the first one. We get to see the heroes explore more places even though it no longer lingers in its innovative ideas. But for an easy pleasure, the pacing is swift and the action is constant, but the story still offers some themes worth seeking out; settling into Tris's trauma and behavioral issues, and then some social commentaries. The former is often played out with bombastic bad dream sequences while the latter is understated by making its conflict look like any generic corrupt governments. But the real trouble here is how both of its core and its action don't mix well together. Putting its serious situations next to a stylish action scene just makes it look silly as a whole. But it does have a clever additional climax, while preposterous, it still manages to somewhat resolve the arc of Tris.The new director is known for the mediocre RED movies and, y'know, R.I.P.D. His style definitely overpowers each scenario, but he does spare the same breathing room of the first movie when it comes to providing details. The action is just too absurd compared to the film's occasional gravity. Some might call it exciting, there is mild tension in some parts, but much of the priority is to make things look cool, which also glosses some supposedly grim moments, with snazzy CGI and cool swagger.The best strength of the film lies on the performances: Shailene Woodley still buys into her character. She exhibits Tris beyond to what is now written to the character. The villains have become the lesser of themselves, but that fact is indeed surpassed by their talents; with Kate Winslet giving a sense of humanity to the suddenly unreasonable Jeanine, while Miles Teller brings a measure of levity in Peter. Other great stars like Naomi Watts and Octavia Spencer are underused and yet brought an impact in their scenes.Insurgent is not a good movie, but the viewers might value it as one of the rare not-good young-adult movies that isn't boring. I mean many YAs are bad and dull, it almost becomes unbearable. This one however would only be bragged about its silliness and sometimes laughable choices that instead becomes a guilty pleasure. There are some cool action and all, but again this genre asks for something beyond spectacle and maybe sophisticated, and there were only few movies that got it right, so far. Because it's possible to get past by the romantic clichés or the same dystopian future/revolution tropes. The source material may not be that great, but it still considers some interesting things that a film adaptation could transcend, but the pretentious action really gets in the way and that doesn't necessarily justify its deeper potentials. It may be a popcorn entertainment, but if this was labeled as another action film, it would remain not diverged.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent

I know that movies don't follow the books very well, but I enjoyed Divergent and could not wait for Insurgent. This movie really disappointed me. I had high hopes for it. The reason was that I loved the book and knew they would change the story, but they changed it so dramatically it hardly had anything in common with the book, and the story/plot they used to replace the books story/plot was incomparable- I loved the book far better. I guess what I'm getting to here is IF you read the book and you're a huge fan of the book, this movie will disappoint.Along with that- the acting was great- but the plot in my opinion was very predictable and poorly written.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
70,bbickley13-921-58664,"Nice,violent action adventure, but not the best laid out sequel.",7,22 March 2015,"Reminds me of the Matrix Reloaded where the action was kicked up a notch in replacement of the story that laid the foundation in the first movie.This is what a mindless action movie driven by a girl looks like. She spends the whole movie kicking ass and taking names, and she still gets to be rescued by what now is her dashing sidekick. I'm not hating on that.The violence was grand. Usually when you adapted a book to the big screen, you tone that down but this does not seem to (although I never read the book). It has everything that a guy would like in an action movie: Chases, fights,gun play. All that is done well.The only problem is, as a sequel you have to know what happen in the last movie to get what's going on here.The first movie had a voice over narration to move parts of the story along not fully portrayed on screen. This movie could have used something like that as it is not able to stand alone. Of course the Lord of the Rings and Hobbit movies are like that but those stores are a little more interesting. This story was paste together with no care and felt like it. As I watched all the action go down I could not care less about the quest.Luckily Shailene Woodley who plays the hero and Kate Winslet who plays the villain were interesting enough without the story to keep the movie going. It was fun watching these two opposing forces go up against each other.Overall, it really is an action movie with a less intelligent story (like most action movies).

71,MattBrady099,Trying to hard to be the next Inception,5,28 March 2015,"F**king teens.The story to Insurgent is about the stakes for Tris as she searches for allies and answers in the ruins of a futuristic Chicago. Tris (Woodley) and Four (James) are now fugitives on the run, hunted by Jeanine (Winslet), the leader of the power-hungry Erudite elite. Racing against time, they must find out what Tris's family sacrificed their lives to protect, and why the Erudite leaders will do anything to stop them. Haunted by her past choices but desperate to protect the ones she loves, Tris, with Four at her side, faces one impossible challenge after another as they unlock the truth about the past and ultimately the future of their world.To those who haven't seen my first review of Divergent basically I thought the movie was alright and I was kind of surprise that I didn't hate it as I thought I will just because of these stupid books adaptations that we get today trying to catch some money or try to be the next Harry Potter which normally backfires. I wasn't like full on excited for Insurgent just because the trailer looked pretty bad and really laughable with it's goofy CGI. But that didn't stop people getting really excited for it and that's most of the teens or just the people who have read the book are here to support or b'tch about the film, whatever comes to they minds. But I came across an old friend that I use to hang around with that has seen the movie and told me that, ""It's the best movie ever. I think it's a five out of five star's rating for me"", oh that same person is the same person who give Fifty Shades of Grey a positive rating and give the great Whiplash a negative response. After seeing the movie myself I have to say that I'm not really impress at all with the film, actually to be honest I think this movie is a bloated mess.Let me just get the positive stuff out the way first: Shailene Woodley in the movie did a decent performance and performed some of the action scenes very well but most of it is performed by a trained stunt woman.Octavia Spencer was really good in this movie. She's in a couple of scenes in the movie and it's a same as a brilliant actress she is only getting small parts in recent movies. But anywhere was great for what scenes she had. The rest of cast like Miles Teller, Theo James and Ansel Elgort all three did great in the movie as well.Now for the down falls: Kate Winslet all through at the movie dose nothing really treating just standing behind a computer screen ordering attacks on people. A complete was of talent from another great actress.The visual effect's at times look fine and okay for the most part, but for most of the movie the effect's look a bit unfinished like it's only one more thing to do before the visual effect's are done. It looks laughable and over the top during it's action scenes. So overall visual effect's not so good.I'm not going to spoil the ending to the movie but let me just say it ended in a way that it's trying to be like Inception, actually the whole film is trying to be Inception when you think about it. The book came out around the time Inception was out maybe the author cope cat the groundbreaking elements from Inception. If fans of the book see this review let me just say this is the second book feels like Inception, correct me or not.Overall Insurgent sometimes doesn't know what it wants to be at times with it's mess plot. To those who like the movie that's fine but to me I will forget this movie about a couple of weeks time.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
72,ArchonCinemaReviews,Uneventful plot filler of a film...,5,18 April 2015,"Another post-apocalyptic YA novel gets another film adaptation installment. This time it's Insurgent, the second of Veronica Roth's Divergent trilogy.The Divergent narrative pushes forward with Insurgent, a plot which replaces the personal journey of Tris as she joins the Dauntless faction with a physical journey against her enemies as she tries to save society.Insurgent begins slightly ahead of where Divergent left off. The fugitive Dauntless members Peter, Four and Beatrice Prior (Tris) and her brother, Erudite Caleb, have found refuge and sanctuary in hiding with kind Amity after escaping the vicious attack on Abnegation on Jeanine's order. Their safety is not to last for long as Jeanine commences a thorough search of the land combing for Divergents, as one Divergent is the key to opening a mysterious box that holds profound answers to their society.As a narrative, Insurgent reeks of plot filler and seems completely lacking in merit of beings its own novel and film. Divergent, though unoriginal and following the trend of apocalyptic resurgence stories led by a strong female protagonist, has plenty of content to set up the film and characters. Not masterful in its own right, Divergent was a vast improvement to this year's Insurgent.Insurgent is contrived and forced, though the central complaint for Insurgent rests more on the author Veronica Roth's shoulders in terms of plot creation. Going into this film the plot was clear and linear: Jeanine is an Erudite, steadfast in her knowledge that Erudite should rule and Divergents are a detriment to the system. It is a power struggle and all out siege for control. Then Insurgent begins and this clear narrative is obscured by talks of a box containing revelatory secrets from the founders. It is a cheap plot tactic that, had the novel truly had a narrative worthy and paced to arc across three novels, would not feel so random and forced. Then, to top it all off, Insurgent progresses in a cliché and predictable manner so that any shock, emotion or enjoyment is wiped away.Overall, Insurgent is a jumpy narrative full of vignettes spun together in a paltry fashion in a pathetic attempt to bind together a story. Unlike the conclusion of Divergent, you will not be left curious of what is in store for the characters and futuristic society. Insurgent is fine but will most likely end up being the weakest film in the franchise, at no fault to the actors or director who all do an admirable job.Please check out our website for full reviews of all the recent releases.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent

75,LloydBayer,"Except for the charismatic performance of its lead actress, Insurgent is a two-bit attempt at building a mega-bucks franchise",4,19 March 2015,"Beginning with an intriguing metaphor that has society divided into five factions, 2014's Divergent looked to take YA films to the next level, but can it or will it ever match up to The Hunger Games franchise? Truth is, it doesn't matter. One sure-footed hero (or heroine) is all it takes to rattle iron-fisted tyranny. It's a stirring theme in the rising trend in YA films and by the looks of it, there's more to come. However, the real question we should be asking is if this sequel is necessary.Insurgent, based on the second book in the science fiction series of young-adult novels by Veronica Roth, takes us back days after the events of the first film. Divergent director Neil Burger is replaced by Robert Schwentke and so are the screenwriters. It's too early to say if this was a bad move, and again, it doesn't matter. Here's why: Insurgent is basically a rehash of Divergent but with added visual effects and a bit more violence than expected in a YA film. In other words, if you've missed the first film, Schwentke brings you up to speed with the post-apocalyptic remains of a dystopian Chicago. Tris (Shailene Woodley) is haunted by the massacre of her parents. Along with her boyfriend and instructor Four (Theo James), brother Caleb (Ansel Elgort) and fellow survivor Peter (Miles Teller), Tris must do all she can to outrun, outgun and ultimately outsmart forces sent by main antagonist Jeanine (Kate Winslet).It would have sufficed to leave the setup as such, with a plot device treading towards the breakdown of society and the ensuing anarchy spreading on both sides. Instead, the story is penned with a lot of focus on irrelevant characters whose inclusion only serves to prolong the inevitable face-off between Tris and Jeanine. Naomi Watts plays one such character who simply doesn't add plausibility but somehow becomes the matriarch, much like Julianne Moore turned out to be in the third Hunger Games film. Even so, nothing can prepare you for the utter incoherence that forms the bulk of the story. But if you ever find yourself wondering what the heck is happening, just remember this – In the first film, Tris was introduced as a multi-skilled teen with rebellious potential. In this film, Tris returns as a multi-skilled teen with rebellious potential. Did someone say rehash? In defense, one could say that Schwentke and his trio of screenwriters are setting things up for a third and fourth film, and that action and visual effects are a notch more rewarding than the previous film. True. With a rare twinkle of cosmic luminance in her eyes, one could also add that Woodley has a lot of raw talent and it shows, but unfortunately, it isn't enough to nourish a film with too many deficiencies. Only fans need apply.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
76,p-jonsson,Shares the same mediocrity as the first installment,5,27 August 2015,"As I did in my review of the first installment, in this movie series I should probably point out that I have not read the books. Some people claim that this movie do not follow the books but, obviously, I cannot comment on that. So my review is based on the movie and the movie alone. I have to confess that I mostly watched this movie because I did watch the first installment and felt obliged to see where the story went.This movie have quite a few fairly cool special effects, especially the ones when Tris is in the virtual reality world trying to open the cube with the message to the inhabitants in the closed up city. Unfortunately this pretty much sums up the good parts of the movie.As with Divergent I found this movie to be fairly mediocre. One reviewer said that this was a movie dumbed down for the teenage audience. Unfortunately I feel that he was right. Also unfortunately I think many teenagers are a lot smarter than Hollywood believe they are.The plot is, well, mediocre. The acting is fairly meh. The main character, Tris, really lacks any form of charisma and spends most of the movie going around in some state of melancholy feeling sorry for herself and everything that happens around her. Apart from Four most of the people were behaving immaturely, cluelessly, froze up or panicked whenever something nasty happened and switched allegiances back and forth like you changed shirts.When Tris finally opened the cube I was expecting something cool and unexpected. What we got was a rather dull message about the city and its ""purpose"". I complained in my review of divergent that we got absolutely no background information as to how the people had ended up in this ridiculous situation with a closed city and these factions that I still do not understand what they were supposed to solve. The message was supposed to explain this but it explained absolutely nothing except that the divergents were some kind of purpose or solution.The ending? Well again this is a book series so it is not surprising that it ends in somewhat of a cliffhanger but it was really a cheap ending, one that you would expect from a TV series episode.So I cannot say that I liked the movie very much. The virtual reality special effects scenes where fairly cool but that was about it.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
77,James_De_Bello,5/10,5,20 March 2015,"I am such a big fan of Shailene Woodely that I was actually looking forward to ""Insurgent"" despite not liking ""Divergent"". That's how much I love her work. Unfortunately, just like in the previous movie, her brilliant work doesn't ultimately save the film, yet it definitely helps it. Lets make it clear: ""Insurgent"" isn't in anyway a train wreck, it's just another bad movie with some good things, but many problems.Talking about problems, from frame one to the credits roll there is one thing that is totally forgotten: logic. Polt coherence, nah, character integrity, nah, logical storytelling, nah. It is such a mess from a point A to point B perspective that I was aghast at how anyone would think it possible for me to accept what was going on on screen. Multiple times I laughed when I wasn't supposed to. Even the ending, that is supposed to be this big kick, ended up just being another senseless scene. Coming out, I was trying to think about the big reveal in the film, but I kept loosing cue of thought since it is such a logistically poor idea. Even the message the movie wants to get through is totally murky and unclear.On the other hand, ""Insurgent"" can count on the fantastic job by Shailene Woodley. She has such and intense, yet not invasive screen presence that she makes everything her character is doing legitimate. She once again disappears in the role. I am serious, I'm not saying this just because I am her biggest fan. She really sells Tris as a character and makes her possibly the only individual with some coherence in the movie, maybe alongside Theo James' Four, who remains a flat character, but is helped by his Charisma. Moreover, the big sequences are directed actually very well, I was surprised to see such a good grip. Other than having some remarkable visuals they also have solid camera work that doesn't rely on shaky cam or fast cuts.""Insurgent"" cannot save itself from its total absence of rationality, but it didn't in any way make for a bad time at the cinema.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
78,scottshak_111,A fast paced thrilling joyride!,7,1 April 2015,"Good thing we have gradually stepped into the dark in this one. Roth isn't afraid to kill people any more, and we don't mind watching the dead! With the release of Divergent last year, and the mediocrity it skimmed on, Insurgent seemed like a long shot. But boy does it prove everyone wrong. The flick comes in strong with a lot of action and thrilling acts of defiance. It is one hell of a joyride wrapped up beautifully in one fine editing thread of awesomeness.Plot runs gorgeously complementing the acting prowess of Shailene Woodley and Kate Winslet. Theo James still lacks the gravity of the extraordinary but works just fine with Shailene in the vanguard. Miles Teller is an exceptional and inevitable element to the tale and is still amazing behind the lens. Jai Courtney is ruthless as ever and Zoe, well she hasn't been given much screen time here.The time that has been squeezed out of action is well spent on drama, where Shailene simply blows you away. She is relatable and does manage to weigh in on your emotional heart with her breaking voice and concerned countenance. Dream sequences in the movie are quite exceptional. Withering buildings and bodies look really badass when fragmenting.SPOILERS: There are several instances in the movie where the direction seems to be abruptly gliding towards dodgy. Like the unrealistic direction when Edgar finds out about Four's true identity. Also, Caleb's reluctance to continue the sojourn spoiled by Ansel's drab acting and Shailene and Theo's shallow comeback. Missing gravity on Theo's face would occasionally compel the movie to circle mediocre flames. The flick also misses out on character development for some crucial elements, for instance, introduction of Uriah to the tale was pretty bland and abrupt. Also, we don't get a proper glimpse into Johanna's life either.Wrapping up a book in two hours is hard. To what Robert Schwentke managed in a flick is worth commendable. If only the franchise grated itself on a fully fledged TV series, it would be a whole different story to show every bit from the book in an amplified manner. But whatever we have on the big screen is still pretty dope. We can work with it. Go watch this beauty!",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
79,fciocca,Insurgent - the torture continues,3,16 October 2019,"The second chapter of the Divergent series, follow up from the exact same point in which the first movie ended. Insurgent improved slightly the story telling and is less boring, even if some scenes are completely unnecessary. Action scenes, that should be the main core of this production are embarrassing: who worked on the title clearly do not know how to use a green screen properly, and CGI effects can be definitely better. Moreover, as usual Shailene Woodley (Tris), is completely flat in her acting, you don't know if she is angry, sad or happy, because she does not have any facial expression, it seems that you are looking at a rock. Theo James has more or less the same acting skills: a tree trunk. The only one that did a decent job is Kate Winslet, as the main villain.I don't even know how you can release a movie like this, with a budget of 110 millions dollars (IMDb movie page as source) and not to put some efforts on a technical perspective, maybe actors were too expensive? I don't have idea, the only thing that I know is that I thought that doing worse than the previous chapter was impossible, but they made it: they managed to fail harder.I will try to watch also the third and last movie to see if at least in the end they were able to save something, but I highly doubt.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent

81,troyputland,The implausible Insurgent.,6,5 April 2015,"Insurgent follows where Divergent ended. Divergents Tris (Woodley) and Four (James) are on the run from Jeanine's (Winslet) tyrannical charge in post-apocalyptic Chicago. Taking solitude with the Amity faction, the couple, along with Peter (Teller) and Tris's brother Caleb (Elgort), hide out until the time comes to strike back, and seek vengeance on those who've killed Tris's parents. Nowhere is safe and the five faction's ideologies are torn. Neither are right or wrong, expect for the malicious Jeanine and her intention on using and abusing Divergents. The deeper the story goes, the more implausible it becomes. Why was this society divided in the first place? Why are the Divergent such a threat? Hopefully this questions will be answered. Woodley's tremendous acting distracts us from suspending judgement, struggling with her past decisions. Winslet is satanical yet serene as the villain, Miles Teller has moments of redemption and Theo James is more than eye candy this time round. Everyone else misses their mark, just like every gunshot misses theirs. Insurgent is a 12A film that plays it safe where nobody's in any real danger.Check out more of my reviews on http://straighttelling.co.uk",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
82,kermitkid,"Step down, but still fun",8,30 March 2020,"The usual case with me for sequels is I usually enjoy them more because they don't need to spend as much time developing the characters and can jump right into the action. Not so with this film. I enjoyed ""Divergent"" more. That's not to say I didn't like this movie, just not as much. I still thought it was great. Some parts were a bit unnecessary and slow, I thought the way they filmed the action sequences was great, though. The ending made me wonder ""How are they going to continue this?"" and I'm excited to see how, whenever that may be. There was a bit of overacting by Shailene Woodley in this film (her crying felt forced and unrealistic) but the other actors did a great job. It's not the best YA series out there, but it is still enjoyable. I'm excited to see part 3 (and possibly 4).

Beatrice continues her role as the Divergent and attempting to get over the loss of her parents while feeling guilty about her friend's Will's death at her hands. She discovers that Tobias mother Evelyn who faked her death has been helping the Divergents against the faction system in attempt to find a better solution. However Tris still has to worry about the continued threat of Jeanine Matthews who is still attempting to eliminate her feeling that Divergents are a threat to the faction system and trying to figure out what the puzzle box contains. The film also introduces new characters such as Joanna Reyes played by Octavia Spencer and fan favorite Uriah. While I do feel that the film could have benefited from a longer running time, since I felt certain aspects from the book were changed and certain character aspects not properly fleshed out. However the film does have decent action, great visuals, and some humorous moments from Miles Teller who plays Peter. Can't wait for the two part Allegiant finale.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
84,nicolechan916,Cool action and effects with good acting.,7,28 April 2015,"I couldn't remember where Divergent left off, so was feeling a little disoriented at the beginning. Plus the addition of new characters was a bit sudden, but not that bad. The thing is I couldn't connect with Tris and the film just started out with her being a kind of emotional mess, and I partly knew the reason why but it wasn't enough to convince me.The action scenes and visual effects were all well done. It reminds me a bit of The Matrix, with the computerization parts of the stimulation, but that is probably because I watched The Matrix recently. There was also this one sequence which was identifiable as animated because Tris was unrecognisable and looked like an animation character, but apart from that the rest of the visuals were cool.I'm not sure if it was the acting or the characters but I felt that they were somehow a little too predictable and it felt like some were either monotone or trying too hard. Woodley and James did a pretty good job overall and displayed their character's emotions well. Elgort and Teller felt a bit monotone though I'm thinking that might just be their characters, in which case the characters need more development. Winslet to me, felt a little overboard in some of her reactions.The conclusion was not expected at all, but getting to that was a little too easy. There was no explanation as to how Tris knew she had to do whatever and it seemed to be a kind of in the moment thing. The twist was pretty good, I didn't see it coming.So overall though the action and visuals were cool, it felt a bit too easy at times and the characters were a little too flat. I am glad that there was more Maggie Q in it this time, but still not enough!Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",The Divergent Series - Insurgent

They have one good film in their series or no good films, so far with Hunger Games theirs one(catching Fire) and with this series it's zero and getting worse. That is quite disappointing given some of the talented actors I saw in this movie, and actors who have such potential but are in films that are just messy. The second chapter in the Divergent series sees Tris Prior where we left her, hiding in a faction called Animety or something like that. While Janeine(Winslet) has taken over the city and has ordered the dauntless to search for a special divergent to open some box that was found at the Prior home. As to why only one special Divergent can open the box the movie has no clue, no one divergent should be able to open the stupid thing, if only a divergent can open it, then any divergent should be able to, not just the chosen one or something. You know I actually walked out waiting for my mother to pick me up and some elder man asked ""what was the moral?"" and I wanted to answer better question ""What was the point?"" this movie is not fun, engaging, have a good story or resembles any awe or enjoyment so what was this film trying to accomplish. The performances may be good from some of the actors which is the only thing that saved the first film, and the only thing that is saving this film, but I hated this one more than the first one. I do not care or know about any of these characters. They are not likable, they are all a-holes. When Tris's brother try's to help her the first she just yells at him, Four just gets tough for no reason, Janeine is the villain so you probably won't like her because her motive sucks, and Miles Teller plays an a-hole. The film does not come all together in a well constructed formulaic fun or interesting picture it just comes off as an okay Michael Bay movie, the only difference is better acting. I'm giving Insurgent a one and a half out of five.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
86,CleveMan66,"""The Divergent Series: Insurgent"" maintains the quality of ""Divergent"" and establishes an impressive identity of its own.",9,20 March 2015,"If you haven't seen 2014's ""Divergent"" or read Veronica Roth's trilogy, ""The Divergent Series: Insurgent"" (PG-13, 1:59) may be a little hard to follow, but I think it's worth the effort. So, here's what you missed: Within a walled city, just outside the ruins of downtown Chicago in a post-apocalyptic world over two centuries in the future, people are divided into five factions which perform the major functions of society. The Erudite faction is made up of the smart people – and they are the society's rulers. Candor is the faction for honest people – society's judges. Dauntless are the strong, athletic and fearless – the perfect people to help keep order. The Abnegation faction includes the selfless souls who help others – and, last but not least, Amity is a community of peaceful farmers. At about the age that people graduate from high school in our society, in this brave new ""Divergent"" world, these young adults take a virtual reality test that reveals their aptitude – which is supposed to be their destiny.This is a real problem of Beatrice Prior (Shailene Woodley). Her test results are inconclusive. She shows attributes of multiple factions. That makes her ""divergent"", a threat to the social order. She conceals her divergence, picks Dauntless as her faction, changes her name to Tris and begins her training. She struggles, but works very hard to succeed. If she flunked out, she'd become ""Factionless"", a group of homeless people – without jobs and without a place in society. Although Tris does start doing better in her training, she is found out to be divergent. She ends the first film on the run with her brother, Caleb (Ansel Elgort), Peter (Miles Teller), who is her Dauntless classmate and bitter rival, and a young man who calls himself ""Four"" (Theo James) and is her Dauntless instructor and newfound love interest.The ""Insurgent"" story picks up just days after the story in ""Divergent"" ends. Tris, Four, Caleb and Peter are hiding out with the Amity faction, led by Johanna (Octavia Spencer). Tris is racked with guilt over the death of her parents, but she keeps trying to suppress her feelings (along with her feelings for Four) because she's intent on getting to the Erudite leader, Jeannine (Kate Winslet) – and killing her. But first, these rebels have to find the rest of their fellow Dauntless friends that left the training complex with them – and avoid the Dauntless citizens who remained loyal to Jeanine, and are still being led by Eric (Jai Courtney) and Max (Mekhi Phifer). While Tris is trying to get to Jeanine, Jeanine continues to hunt Divergents, but not just because she considers them a threat. Jeannine's minions have found a metal box decorated with the symbols of each of the factions. It contains a message from their society's founders; something that Jeannine believes will validate her authority. In the meantime, Tris and company also encounter Candor, led by Jack Kang (Daniel Day Kim), and a group of the Factionless, led by a mysterious woman named Evelyn (a brunette Naomi Watts). All the factions play significant roles in this film, as do the major characters who survived the first film, one who didn't, and some interesting new characters.This is the first sequel I've reviewed and spent more time talking about the original film than the one I'm reviewing, but there are good reasons for that. First of all, unlike most well-done sequels, it's hard to appreciate the second without understanding what happened in the first. The context is important and you can't talk about ""Insurgent"" without knowing the basic vocabulary from ""Divergent"". Secondly, there are so many twists, turns and surprises in this second film that I can't say much about the story without revealing major plot points. It's not that the sequel's plot is hard to follow, but I really try to stay away from spoilers. All this is a way of saying that this second film of ""The Divergent Series"" builds very well on the story of its predecessor and doesn't waste any time establishing an identity of its own.As great a job as the first film did highlighting the importance of being yourself, ""The Divergent Series: Insurgent"" writes that message as if with lightning. The action is heightened in the second installment and so is the emotion. And adding to the message of individuality are powerful messages of selflessness and forgiveness – forgiveness of others and of yourself. The story is fast-paced and thrilling, the climactic scene is shocking and profound (at least, for those of us who haven't read the books) and the ending is to die for. A lot of the professional critics don't seem to like this movie very much, but I think they're missing something. Maybe I'm just divergent, but I'm giving this film an ""A.""",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
87,blakiepeterson,A Laughable Dystopian Thriller,4,2 May 2015,"In the distant future, an uprising against the government of ends brutally and tragically, forcing those who survive the revolution to (a) form a new political system or (b) conform to the recent totalitarian control. Society is divided into sections called s; each has a certain specialty, like or . But despite the initially seamless system, civil unrest is mounting with slow but capable precision. At its lead is a young man or woman who bears unique traits, like or ; they are the only hope for a democratic future as the ruthless government will do everything they can to deter change.If you haven't guessed it already, I have just written the formula for creating a brand new Hunger Games/Divergent series (or run-of-the-mill video game at worst). Post-apocalyptic setting? Check! Attractive young people who want to be free at last? Check! A governmental head honcho who wants nothing more than to see those attractive young peoples heads on sticks? Check!Where The Hunger Games and Divergent split apart is specifically at the fault of their makers. Suzanne Collins concocted a series that held enough interest for the moody youths all the while pressing thought- provoking political questions; the novels, along with their film counterparts, feel timely, and most importantly, smart. Veronica Roth made a franchise of silly but entertaining (and obviously YA oriented) books more intent on action and romance instead of something deep. There's nothing wrong with that, but in the realm of film, the Divergent movies somehow feel dated. The Hunger Games films smash the box-office along with audience and critical expectations; the Divergent projects, on the other hand, limp along in comparison, looking like a crowd of Jans attempting to be one big Marcia.As much as I knew the first Divergent was manipulative formula that told me that things were more urgent than they actually were, I liked it. I liked its full-blooded action, its futuristic aromas, and most importantly, Shailene Woodley (who is on her way to becoming a major star). It wasn't great, but it didn't underestimate our intelligence, either. But months later, I couldn't remember many of the plot points: All I could recollect was a lot of running, punching, breathy kissing, brightly lit technological colors, and most importantly, Kate Winslet scowling her ass off. Insurgent suffers from the dreaded sophomore slump (not to suggest Divergent was an unmatchable masterpiece). Like its predecessor, things are kept moving at lightning speed, and we're never bored; but unlike its predecessor, the weak links in the storyline and dialogue are much more noticeable. The first time around, we were just starting to get used to this new (yet somehow familiar) dystopian world, but in Insurgent, we've adjusted ourselves, and like someone who's lived in the same house for thirty years, flaws become much more apparent than they were before.Divergent ended with leading heroine Tris Prior (Woodley) hastily escaping the murderous government after a violent confrontation that left the Divergent hating villain Jeanine Matthews (Kate Winslet) with a knife in her hand (a constant reminder, as Winslet dons a distractingly large bandage). Now in hiding with love interest Four (Theo James), her brother (Ansel Elgort), and a recent ally (Miles Teller), Tris is trying to regroup; as a rose in a sea of white daisies, she is Public Enemy #1.Meanwhile, Jeanine finds herself in the possession of an ancient box that was hidden centuries ago by the creators of the Faction system. Inside The Box (it deserves a title) is a message that will come in handy in a time of crumbling systematic function; problem is, only a Divergent has the ability to unlock it. Desperate, the government begins testing every single person who resides in the Factions, hoping to find a Divergent in the crowd who has strong enough abilities to eventually get their paws on the secret message. But because Tris is the most powerful Divergent of them all, Jeanine begins a cutthroat quest to find the woman who hurt her poor little hand.If the plot sounds slightly weak, it is. It can barely hold itself together, as it wants to find an excuse to have as many loud action sequences and uninspired bits of dialogue as it possibly can. It connects the dots with hesitation. Yet, I find myself sounding way too harsh. Yes, I laughed at much of the unintentional seriousness, and yes, the script ranges from embarrassing to bland. But I had a good time at the theater, even if much of that good time was brought unintentionally. I guess that's what counts. I'm in the wrong demographic anyway (as a movie critic, I lit up at the very sight of Watts). This is a film for young teenage girls (I went with my 14-year-old sister, after all), and if I look or act anything like a teenage girl than I sincerely apologize.Insurgent doesn't quite suck, but boy is it dull. Not dull like boring; dull like a recycled joke is. It's mildly diverting, sure, but it's also kind of lame. For most established names (ahem, Kate Winslet, Naomi Watts, Octavia Spencer), the film is merely a roadblock in an impressive career. But for rising talents like Shailene Woodley and Miles Teller, it's a challenge; to transcend middling material is a hugely difficult task. But Woodley and Teller are going to be stars; Insurgent will be the film they silently chuckle at when they win their Oscars someday.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
88,abouhelier-r,Insurgent,9,19 March 2015,"Beatrice Prior must confront her inner demons and continue her fight against a powerful alliance which threatens to tear her society apart with the help from others on her side.Insurgent is the sequel to Divergent which came out last year. It stars Shailene Woodley, Mile Teller, Ansel Elgort, Theo James and Kate Winslet. As for Divergent, I did not hate that movie; it was pretty good actually. This time I'm impressed with Shailene Woodley's work and the fact that the movie seems to be better than most YA book to film adaptation that I've been experienced lately. Going to this movie I was pretty hopeful and excited. I love Shailene Woodley as an actress, Naomi Watts is also in the film: she's great and obviously Kate Winslet is a fantastic actress. Plus, I was really intrigued by the trailer in which we could glimpse a darker part. Insurgent is more intense than the original. In fact, there's more action and it's all filmed very well. The director did a really good job at filming the action scenes, with swift moving shots and lots of long takes, that really made me happy. Though towards the end of the film some scenes were almost to perfectly choreographed that it looks fake and it's difficult to believe that you're watching a tangible thing that is happening. Moreover, Jeanine is newly empowered by new information, new equipment and new techniques. She's an even nasty shade of ugly than she was in the first film and she's on a mission more than ever to find that very special divergent and to rule the world. Kate Winslet is amazing... but in movies she's done before. In that one she's not bad but there's anything for her to do, she wonders around, take tests on people and then takes notes in a very dull and uncaring manner. Her presence as an antagonist is not that meaningful. Tris is still trying to figure out who she is and how she can defines herself apart from her external situation and what others may say in order to influence her decisions. She's determined to accomplish something and regardless of what everyone else says. Tris finds it in herself to be committed to her own integrity. Shailene Woodley is once again amazing as Tris, you can really feel the deep pain of her character, she truly did an incredible job portraying that. One of the best scene is when she's forced to tell the truth about various things she's ashamed of and she really sold it! So much depth and so much background was given to her character, her regret, the thing she feels ashamed of, that all other characters feel wooden and lifeless. However, something I've realised with book to film adaptation whether it's Divergent, Twilight, The Mortal Instrument, Hunger Games or even 50 Shades of Grey; all of those come with a very strong and opinionated fan base. Some of my friends who read the books told me that there are a lot of things happening in the movie that are not in the book which can be viewed as a little chaotic but don't worry if you're already a fan of the book you're going to enjoy the film as you'll be already pumped for it. You may be a little confused by those surprised twists and turns; you'd have to keep in mind that it is an adaptation and that not everything will be like the book for the sake of the big screen. Overall the best part of Insurgent is Shailene Woodley, her character and the emotion she gives to her, how good her performance is and the fact that the director did a really great job at filming the action scenes.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
89,stephendaxter,"Slow and dull first half, fast and interesting second",5,9 July 2015,"Insurgent is the sequel to Divergent, again starring Shailene Woodley as the lead and once again it is disappointing, failing to live up to its predecessor and what i thought was an alright trailer. It failed to build up any interesting plot, it sets up some interesting events in the first 5 minutes but then for the next 45 minutes it slows right down and ditches any action for lots of talking and it is just draining. At this point it is really relying on the characters alone to carry the film but the characters were just poorly written. You could not relate to any of the characters because all of them were dull and lifeless and also accompanied by some atrocious dialogue from almost every character. The performances were not bad though, just as in the first one, Shailene did a great job at portraying her character but the character was just uninteresting and for a lead you want a little more. In terms of the characters, Miles Teller was the only character that was really interesting and fun to watch. The scenes that had him in it i actually somewhat enjoyed so the film would have definitely benefited from more Miles. Most of these problems come from the first hour of the movie, the character issues do transfer over to the last 45 minutes but it is like a different movie. It starts to pick itself up and gets pretty interesting. It had a little more structure in that final 45 minutes and a lot of the plot points mentioned earlier come together and you get a little more action and all of a sudden there is quite a bit going on. The dystopian world still was something that was not as heavily featured as i would have liked, i have not read the books so i have no idea whether we ever get to see the world away from these factions but i feel this was a missed opportunity to expand the scope of this series to focus on that outer world. So in the end this film failed to build on the first film with a very slow pace and dull characters and dialogue, but a pretty strong finale elevates my score. - 4.5/10",The Divergent Series - Insurgent

91,michaelhirakida,Why Aren't These Films More Successful?,9,4 April 2015,"Ever since I saw Divergent, I have been craving the next chapter in the planned four film series with the Two Parts coming in the next years. After I saw Insurgent, I was raving about how this was better then The Hunger Games. The question I ask though, Why aren't these films more successful? I mean sure, it has a large fan base, the two movies made a lot of money, but surprisingly, not as much as The Hunger Games which in fact is unintentionally unoriginal. This series is way better for me because it keeps my eyes tight on the screen.Continuing from Divergent, The Characters are wonderful and developed strongly, including Shailene Woodley as Tris who gives an amazing performance. In fact, everyone is amazing in this movie. Miles Teller's Peter, Theo James' Four, Kate Winslet's Jeanine, everyone makes this movie feel strong and life like. What I love about Woodley's role is that she doesn't suffer the J-Lo Freak out Syndrome. If you don't know what I'm talking about, it's when Jennifer Lawrence starts freaking out in a scene prostituting her acting abilities to the point of wanting to slap her. We get that she is a good actress, but she keeps shoving it in our faces to the point of saying she is a bad actress with no talent and the only reason she got popular was because of The Hunger Games. Woodley is perfect, a better actress than Lawrence in my opinion, because she is not looking for any special award, she just wants to make the fans and audience happy.As for the rest of the film, I loved it. The visuals are very outstanding especially for the simulation scenes. The action is nowhere near generic, the characters are sharp and twisty, the music was great, the villains were great also, everything about this movie is literally better than The Hunger Games. But If I had to pick out one flaw, it's very little. It's just that I thought characters were too easily forgiven.I really wish these films were more successful. I love these movies and they make great adaptations on how to do a Dystopia right. It's right up there with The Giver Film Adaptation. If you haven't seen Insurgent, watch it now. It's a must see for Dystopia Fiction Fans and Regular Film Goers alike.92/100 A-",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
92,rprince-832-6294,"A flawed film, but better than the first?",6,20 March 2015,"-Insurgent (2015) movie review: -Insurgent is the sequel to Divergent and part of the Divergent series based off the Divergent books, which is the whole dystopian future young-adult genre I don't really need to describe. In Insurgent, we pick back up with Tris and Four as they are hiding out from the government who it trying to track down Divergents because they represent a threat to the government. I am not going to say too much about it actually, because if you have not read the books like me, you won't know the plot until you see the film. Thanks unhelpful trailers.-I got a lot of disagreement when I said Divergent was worth watching on Netflix (or for free) only, so we will see how the review of its overall lesser sequel goes! -The story did not progress very much, but that is probably because I expected it to be different. It also added a lot of plot points that made the movie a little too convoluted.-The pace was good. There are enough interesting things that happen to keep interest most of the time. However I am slightly worried they put too much into wrapping up this film. One thing that I was happy about was that all the dream sequence tests or whatever that made up all of the trailers did not take half the film. It had its amount of space, but it was not too much.-Shailene Woodley did a good job. But she and Theo James were the only ones who tried to do a good job. I say that because the entire supporting cast looked like they just did not want to be there. Probably because they have all moved on to higher things. Jai Courtney has Terminator now, so he was still good, but not as dislikeable of interesting as the first. Miles Teller was great, but he and Kate Winslet, being the best two actors there, did not have to try very hard. Mainly because all the star of Whiplash had to do was be sassy and all the Oscar winner had to do was stand and be angry. Also I was really worried that Ansel Elgort was going to just fall asleep. In every scene.-The characters were at least interesting. Other than the fact that there were too many characters I was supposed to care about, I enjoyed the character development this film added. And I love Miles Teller's character. Even though he is a dislikable character, he was always entertaining.-The film's music was about the same as the first, which means I liked it, but it was forgettable.-There were some effects that were not great. But there were also some good effects.-The film also had some good action sequences, a few twists, and some moments like the ones that made the first one good. The writing itself, even though the dialogue was a bit cheesy, has some of those moments throughout that made it honestly not too bad. There are soooooooo many little flaws throughout the film though. A few that, if pointed out, can really change the entire film. However, this film also lacked the two things I didn't like about Divergent: Attempts to appeal to a young-adult female audience by using mirrors, and the plot from The Hunger Games.-Insurgent has its flaws and plenty of them, but it also has some things that the first one did not and had the advantage of breaking away from the now cliché YA origin film. I will be honest, I found myself enjoying Insurgent. If it were not for Miles Teller, I would be like ""Yeah, Netflix"" but a few small elements of the film helped me to actually be entertained through much of the film. It is not THAT good, but I did feel like I got some of my money's worth, so I will say that Insurgent would be worth buying in a $5 bin! -Insurgent is rated PG-13 for some mild language that doesn't get worse than one S-word and some partial nudity/suggestive content.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent

You really go on the journey with her in this film! I loved Kate Winslet and Octavia Spencer in this film. they bring such strong characters into this film and the action in this film is so great. Theo James in this is so great and he is sooo cute!! And I love the relationship between him and Shailene!! This movie is great and I know people have their own opinions about the Divergent films but like with Twilight these are fun and entertaining films. the acting is way better in this than Twilight though.

94,paul_3-960-896774,A good sequel? Maybe not,6,20 March 2015,"Divergent - the first book - was interesting but the first movie was even better, way better if you ask me. They managed to cast great actors and make a realistic futuristic movie. Despite having a different director Insurgent looks familiar I easily slipped back into a world I was already familiar with. The movie is visually impressive, even though it looks a bit too CGI-ish for my taste, making the film not as grounded as Divergent was so at times it feels like watching a video game or an animated version of it. The acting is OK, I mean it's a good cast so what they bring to the table fits the story and the emotional journey these characters have been through. But - because of course there is one - Theo James' (Four) age is seriously starting to show. I know he's only 30 - and Teller is 28 - but in the first movie it didn't seem as weird that he's with Tris (Woodley) but next to 46 years old Naomi Watts, who looks 35, maybe forty, it's really weird. They look like brothers and sisters at best, they could have aged Watts or cast someone else completely because how young was she when she had him? 12? It will be even weirder to see her playing opposite Ray Stevenson (Marcus Eaton) - Four's dad - who'll look like a dirty old man next to her, which is probably why we'll see very little of that.I wish these aspects of the film were the only ones I had a problem with but on top of all of that Insurgent lacks rhythm. It's missing the slow, intense build up in which the tension and the action grows to an entertaining climax but it never doesn't. Don't get me wrong it is action-packed - kinda -, a rich adventure of a film but whenever the tension builds up it quickly dies down to go back up again at some point and that's how it is throughout the movie. It comes and goes in waves but never rides on the high the previous action scenes gave you.Although, it's faithful to the book Insurgent was a bit of a disappointment I expected better. It's only slightly more entertaining than the book, they could have done better. @wornoutspines",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
95,Solnichka,The problem here is really casting,3,13 December 2015,"This whole series of films revolves around Woodley's inability to convince viewers she's a physical force and presence like the character needs to be. You can't take a girly girl and give her a weapon and expect anyone to believe she can beat people up.Watching Woodley run in this film is silly -- she has no athletic presence to sell this role, and without that, the whole premise collapses on itself. Never mind the overdone stereotypes around her: If she's the focus, the whole story relies on her believability, and it just isn't there. Bad casting (i.e., see ""Twilight"" and Kristen Stewart/Robert Pattinson) can ruin the best of stories, and this story isn't even good to begin with.Otherwise, the visuals are impressive to look at, and that alone might be worth the price of a rental to see how another director envisions a post-apocalyptic world created by a rip-off artist author.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
96,barbagvido,Bigger but inferior to its predecessor,7,12 March 2016,"Divergent was a very good movie. Bit it was easy to make it good because it's based on the best book in the series and all they had to do was to get the story done. This was a little trickier, but still not as hard as the third book will be to adapt because the story was a total mess there. But they still decided to do a different approach to the series. The people were complaining that the first movie felt to much like The Hunger Games. Well, this feels too much like The Matrix.It doesn't mean I don't like this new tone. It was a lot different from the book, but still more faithful than Maze Runner:The Scorch Trials. But I still found this new approach to be very interesting. Maybe it was really cheesy at parts, but it felt more refreshing than the first movie. And I like that the trauma factor is reduced here because it was really annoying in the book. Also, the CGI is surprisingly great for a sequel to the movie that wasn't even that successful like some other franchises. The acting is nothing special except Kate Winslet, she was a magnificent villain. And one more time, they turned the cliffhanger ending from the book in other, more complete ending in case the movie fails. They did the same with the first one and I love that they are doing that because they are doing it great.This movie is extremely fast-paced (probably too much) and some scenes just don't have the same impact with PG-13 rating. And I think they could add just a some more events from the book too make it more epic. But aside from that I don't have many other complaints. I liked this movie, but I just wasn't that impressed.It's an entertaining movie, no doubt, but I still think that it could be better.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent

98,EmmaDinkins,Chix Chat on Film review: Tech'd out future,7,24 March 2015,"I was anxiously awaiting this film, especially since I had seen Divergent several times recently as it is in regular rotation on HBO. I actually recommend that anyone intent on seeing Insurgent should get a Divergent refresher, since this story picks up just days from where the first film left us. Tris (Shailene Woodley) is plagued with nightmares and torn with guilt especially over the deaths of her parents, so for most of the film we only get this soul sucking melancholy from her, unless she is in hand to hand combat and then she transforms into this lean mean fighting machine. I am fully invested in this series because of the portrayal of such strong women. Jeanine (Kate Winslet) is even more committed to her Divergent witch hunt and will stop at nothing to maintain the status quo. In this story we gain Johanna (Octavia Spencer) and Evelyn (Naomi Watts), both of which are leaders in and outside the faction system, although Natalie (Ashley Judd) was lost, somewhat. The reason that I say 'somewhat' is that with the Erudite technology to get inside someone's head, the possibility exists for anyone to resurface. If it were not for the Tris and Four (Theo James) budding love affair, this could have quickly turned into another futuristic downer. The men played an integral role in the story, they were all supporters for their respective women. I was surprised at the direction that Caleb (Ansel Elgort) chose and I was thrown aback with the initial Peter (Miles Teller) situation. I suppose it was explained in the books, which I have not read so perhaps that's why I was sitting there perplexed. Although his initial alliance wasn't explained in the film, his top priority was clear throughout the story: self preservation. This film had it all sans any comic relief, it had action adventure, drama, romance, deception, great special effects and a reasonable running time. I for one am now anxiously awaiting Allegiant.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent

Maybe I just ignored that tragic perspective about a sad future of the world where everyone has been put under some kind of 1984esq loss of freedom. The characters were determined to get to the source of the problem and bring resolution, and determination & grit ruled the day. I loved the escape by train scene.

102,vistheindian,What's in the box? WHAT'S IN THE F***ING BOX!?,6,31 March 2015,"Quickie Review:After the attempted coup by Jeanine (Kate Winslet), Tris (Shailene Woodley) and her friends narrowly escape. The factionless along with Tris plan to retaliate against the Erudite faction. Meanwhile, Jeanine is rounding up all divergents to open a message from the founders that could change the course of the civil war. Much like the first movie Insurgent has a richly detailed world and it is further expanded here. Shailene Woodley is still the core strength of this film. However, multiple problems such as one-note characters and meandering subplots, hinder Insurgent from being the complete package that it could've been. The last act of the movie does help redeem the movie, but unless you're a fan of the books there is no rush to go out and see it.Full Review:Divergent last year was somewhat lukewarm experience for me. I liked the concept that it was going for but somewhere in the execution I lost some of my interest. Still there were enough positives there that I didn't completely dislike the movie. It seems I have the same reaction this time around with Insurgent.Insurgent continues to develop that dystopian society beyond what was introduced in the first film. These were some of the more interesting parts, seeing what position the factionless, Candor, and Amity take in the conflict and their motivation for it. I must say that the Amity faction did seem like they were smoking a bit too much of their crops because they were way too happy about everything, but their leader played by Octavia Spencer grounded them in reality. Shailene Woodley continues to do a good job with her character. All her emotions feel real and are never forced, so she makes for a likable protagonist. You are rooting for her throughout the movie even when the story slows down. The last act was the most exciting part of the movie. I am not saying that just because of the action and CGI set pieces (which were shot well), but because the events that followed and their consequences feel relevant. So for that reason the ending is more satisfying than that of the first movie. Of course I am not revealing anything here, but it definitely makes up for some of the complaints I have for the movie.As for those complaints, I have quite a few. To start off, other than Woodley the rest of the cast are either underutilized or are completely one-note. This movie has some great actors like Naomi Watts and Octavia Spencer, but the total amount of relevant screen time they have is less than 5 mins. Then there is also Miles Teller, Ansel Elgort, and Kate Winslet who are incredibly talented, but we don't see that because each of their characters have only one emotional setting. When there is a change in their character it doesn't feel natural, it is completely baffling and feels fake. Beyond the misuse of the cast, Insurgent has a hard time focusing its story. I liked that it picks up right where we left in Divergent, but the middle third of the movie is spent introducing so many characters and story elements that it starts to get a little convoluted. You don't see the significance of these new elements even after the end of the movie (can't say much more without ruining the story for you). Perhaps it is a set-up for the next movies in the franchise.Fans of the book and the first movie will and should run out to see this movie. The world that is created is significantly expanded, and Woodley gives another great performance making her a really good heroine. For newcomers, you have to watch Divergent otherwise you'll be lost. On the other hand, if like me you had mixed feelings about Divergent, expect to have the same reaction to this sequel. For you it is a worthy video-on-demand film.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
103,cattjones,Not Great; but Not Bad,7,20 March 2015,"This film pretty much picks right up where the last one ended with very little time lapse. Jeanine's (Kate Winslet) has issued an order that all divergents need to be killed until her soldiers find a box that was kept in Tris (Shailene Woodley) parents' house and she has discovers that she will need a divergent to open it. Tris, Four (Theo James), Caleb (Ansel Elgort) and Peter (Miles Teller) have found refuge in a little village governed by Johanna (Octavia Spencer) until the hunting begins. Eric (Jai Courtney) and Max (Mekhi Phifer) have retained their blind loyalty to Jeanine; however I think that Eric has gotten even nastier whereas Max is just trying to do his job. I have to say that loyalty is a big element in this film.. you just never know. This film actually kept up a good pace and there was very little lull time. They said that there would be a lot more action in this film. I don't know about ""a lot"" more, but there was definitely more than the last one. I was also glad to see that Tris was no longer wimpy when it came down to fighting, however emotionally she was feeling pretty guilty. They really beat that dead horse throughout the film. I did not see this film in 3D, but because of all the special effect, that might have been a mistake. Man, computer generated imagery has sure come along way. It really makes me look forward to some of the upcoming films this summer like Jurassic World and Terminator. I am happy for my fellow German director Robert Schwentke who has successfully bounced back from that armpit of a film, Rest in Peace Department, RIPD for short, that he directed back in 2013. You can only go up from that one. Anyway, I think that this film will do well especially with the ""tween"" crowd; and once you've invested in the series it's kind of hard to not find out what happens next. Do I think that this film was one of the best films I've seen this year. Nope, but it was entertaining and didn't suck. I don't recommend that you see this film if you haven't seen Divergent. This one holds its own, but you'll enjoy it more if you've seen the first one.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent

Maybe if I was a third grader I would appreciate this fantasy but as an adult it was torture to watch.This movie would need some serious surgery to actually pass as something I could make all the way through. I didn't make it all the way through by the way. The casting, direction and writing would all have to be redone. Basically, throw it all out and start over. Otherwise, this could possibly work as a Yahoo TV movie.File this one in the folder of movies that think the audience is dumb and will just be wow'd by ridiculous action and young heroes.

105,blackwidowis7cool,Darker than the first movie,10,24 December 2019,"This movie is more darker and more mature and much more violent than the first movie. It has great themes and they give you heavy stuff to think about. The animation is spectacular and I love this more than the first movie. The acting is top notch - especially with Shailene Woodley and Kate Winslet. Woodley steps up with her acting and you truly believe that she IS the character she's portraying. She really embraces and doesn't shy away from the issues Tris is struggling and dealing with. She makes Tris extremely relatable and human and I found myself crying at several of her scenes - she's extremely good.
And then there's Kate Winslet. She is PERFECT as the movie's villain. She is cold and evil and she does it extremely well. She is an excellent, excellent actress.
With the violence, while there's definitely more than in the first movie, thankfully they keep it (mostly) just off-camera, but the implication of what is happening is very obvious and if you think about the implication too much, it could make your stomach turn.
It is a solid sequel and I can't wait to watch the next movie!",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
106,MsMovie,Liked it a lot BUT worst 3D ever - go for 2D instead!,6,20 March 2015,"Firstly, I want to start with how much I enjoyed the movie, although it was a lot different from the book, but I still liked it. They developed the characters nicely enough, but there were no real major twists.It definitely lacked the pace and action of the first movie as some of the action in this one was a little boring and too much centered on simulations.Having said that, I have a MAJOR peeve with this movie - I went to see it in super wonderful 3D and it WAS NOT WONDERFUL.I would say it was possibly the worst movie I have seen made in the modern 3D (I was around for the 70's version which was horrible).There was no need at all for 3D in this movie in my honest opinion and you'd be better off saving your money and just seeing the 2D, you'll have more for the concession stand.There were a lot of birds flying around - ooh, how exciting - and there were things falling and coming apart, and then there were just scenes with people walking around that was enhanced with the 3D, to what purpose I'm not sure - just for the hell of it? Just so they could make us pay more thinking it was going to be this major 3D event?As to the movie and the development of the story, it was OK, I will go and see the final chapter, or most likely it will be chapters as they love to make 2 movies for the last book of any series and that's just a money grabbing effort in my opinion too.All in all a good movie with some interesting cinematography and special effects, just not quite as good as I was hoping, and especially not the 3D part.I gave it a 6 which in my book says solidly watchable, but not one I'm likely to be quoting lines from any time soon.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
107,FlorisV,"Darker, action packed sequel that feels like a closer",7,18 March 2015,"This is not a disappointing sequel for me, I haven't read the books so I can judge the film on it's own. While the first movie needed to explain more things and spent a lot of time on what the Dauntless are about, this one shows some facets of other factions: Amity and (more interesting) Candor. Abnegation is virtually destroyed and Erudite is pretty much the enemy. I have always found this division between 5 factions what makes Divergent really interesting, besides the theme of not fitting in a system. Because those themes were already covered in the first part, most of the film shows either chasing, surrendering or attacking, but it does those things well. It's pretty much an action film and one that looks great.Once more, the lead character, though a very good actress, is not very believable when she floors men twice her size in hand to hand combat. Cutting her hair short for a more boyish appearance (Tris looks very girlie and wide eyed) cannot change that. Fortunately she is not too much of a Mary-Sue and has to accept some losses and show vulnerability.The movie clearly had a bigger budget and threw in a lot of neat special effects and spectacular sights. It was a pleasure to look at. I don't really care for fx that much but for a futuristic sci fi...design and visuals can be very important and they certainly didn't cut corners in that department.The movie can be very dark, much more so than the first installment, and both innocents and antagonists get killed without mercy.The ending of the film is however very positive, it feels almost like an end to the trilogy and it makes me curious what's next.This film is getting bashed on a bit too much. It's not brilliant, but neither are the Hunger Games (which were hardly original, considering ). It's aimed at a teen audience. And yet, the political structure and the societal order are much more interesting in the Divergent series. I found this film entertaining from beginning to end and it had some nice twists in store.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
108,OlieRendch,Good acting in a weak story.,8,25 March 2015,"So last year I was pleasantly surprised on how much I enjoyed Divergent, it had a good story, entertaining concepts and pretty solid characters. This year we get Insurgent which takes place five days after the end of the first film and is all about the main characters trying to....well...I'm not entirely sure, even they themselves didn't really know until the last act. It's true, the majority of the film is just our main protagonists wondering around doing various things, sometimes hiding, sometimes being chased, or sometimes confessing in a court of law. In the end, it's the antagonist who pushes the story along, Kate Winslet's character is the one who has a goal and sets out to attain it which is really the only interesting part of the movie; I mean I know they have to cut things out of the book and change things for cinema but this really did feel like it was missing a few chapters; the pacing was definitely off.That being said, what did save the film at times was the amazing acting of the cast, Shailene Woodley does some impressive scenes along with Theo James and Miles Teller who are all brilliant. The action sequences are also top-notch, they're exciting and entertaining so that's a plus and just the environment itself, the CGI can make for some impressive visuals weather it's the post- apocalyptic city or the awesome dream simulations, all good stuff.In conclusion, the story wasn't perfect with clichés scattered here and there but the acting and visuals entertained me so I give the movie 8/10",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
109,fluturoj,Active,7,20 August 2016,"Great franchise of the first part. It follow ups greatly. Differently from The Hunger Games serious, the quality from the first one does not decrease, nor does the story repeat, its simply a non-stop active and fast development of one story. In addition to that, it has twists and surprises and never made me look at the time left for the movie to finish. This is how I know a movie was good. The real-life lessons: because of the gender of the movie I did not expect to find lessons that could be applicable and I did not. The idea however is to draw a parallel on governance and politics and the sought for power. Plausibility: almost impossible to discuss due to the gender of the movie. Character development: I didn't see much development when it comes to the leads but what I liked was the development of Jeanine's character. Everything she did, she believed to be for a greater cause and even in the end she wanted to hide the message because she was afraid of what was outside. I like when characters are given reasons for their actions, I believe that adds to their development the most. Also, I liked Peter switching sides once he realised who cared about his life and who did not. Peter's character was supposed to be smart and honest and this switch proves that he was smart so I'd say that was well done. Caleb's actions too fit to his character- he went to Erudite because he was being selfless (I assume these were his original results) so this action is quite reasonable for his character. So well done in terms of character development (with the exception of the leads). Casting: no critics here, I thing acting and casting was well done too but what I was quite satisfied with was Kate Winslet. She portrayed her character extremely well, she did a great performance. Storytelling: great. The story moves quickly, there are a lot of action scenes and it does not get boring. It engages you and is quite interesting with twists and surprises at the end that are not easily guessed but should have been obvious. It makes you think 'Why did I not see that coming, it makes sense perfectly'. Overall, very enjoyable and I would recommend it.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent

111,russellingreviews,A bridge to nowhere,5,17 March 2015,"""Bridges are perhaps the most invisible form of public architecture."" - Bruce JacksonWalking into the cinema... The Hunger Games, The Giver and Maze Runner. Can this series differentiate itself from all of the other dystopian teen dramas?Overall rating: 2.5 stars Cinematic value: 2 stars Big questions value: 3 starsTris Prior (Shailene Woodley) is living a life under pressure. The pressures of tragedy, politics, and the expectations of all the people in her life. The realisation of her role in this seemingly utopian society and the need for a leadership change. Cracks have formed within and between the well formed structures of their society and war seems inevitable. Lines are drawn and loyalties are being determined as the sides prepare for battle. Aware of the repercussions of her decisions, Tris must move past her own emotions and she must consider her responsibilities amongst the chaos of a burgeoning world order. Could it be that she is the unifying factor to this fragile and fractured world? Insurgent is filled with societal considerations, such as forgiveness, identity, sacrifice and love. In finding her identity, Tris must come to terms with her divergence and how that will effect all who come into her life. Much of Insurgent's action is set in the dry riverbed of the Chicago River. The iconic draw bridges are part of the Chicago landscape, but in this story these mighty expanses are useless. The drawbridges are set in the up position and are covered with vines. These bridges are a representation of this film on many levels. Firstly, the dystopian storyline leaves the audience stuck in the middle of this trilogy and it seems to serve no real purpose. Insurgent provides some connections to the next instalment and introduces some interesting twists, but in the end all it does is leave a yearning for the end of the story. Another similarity to the bridges has to deal with strength. In the first chapters of Divergent, the goal was to strengthen Tris and the other central characters. They experienced physical and mental training that built their stamina and ability to serve the society as the guardians. Insurgent strips away all of the virility and depth of the main characters. Tris and Four (Theo James) continue to have the ability to throw a punch and fire a gun, but they come off as weak and whiny. Four moves from a commanding presence to a love sick puppy. Tris lacks confidence and becomes boring as the central character. The only person with any charisma is Peter, played brilliantly by Miles Teller (Whiplash), who is a despicable opportunist. Yet, when he comes on screen, he adds the needed flavour to the scene. He lacks moral appeal, but inevitably adds a bit of adrenaline to a slow moving story. One key appealing element in the original Divergent story was the movement between the simulated world and reality, which added exceptional tension in the film. Even though the CGI effects have improved for this instalment, Insurgent demystifies this element and causes these portions to drag the story down, opposed to adding some needed action. Insurgent does offer great themes for discussion, such as forgiveness, justice, truth and sacrifice. There was a fascinating depiction of judgement when Tris and Four are put on trial and shown great mercy. Then in the following scene they have to deliver justice in a situation with one of the Dauntless leaders. The moral dilemma makes for a fascinating philosophical consideration, but weighs heavy on the story. In the end, Insurgent felt like it had different intentions to Divergent. They include the same characters, but they seem to be taking themselves too seriously. Within the realm of teen inspired drama, this film was entertaining and was not surprising in its level of violence and adult themes. Yet director, Robert Schwentke seems to unnecessarily apply deep commentaries of society on a story line that is too weak to support the pressure. Ultimately, the bridge of the story cannot handle the additional weight and the film lacks purpose. Leaving the cinema... Insurgent, like Mockingjay Part 1, was not a bad film and did the work to set up the next film and make millions of dollars in the process. There are interesting twists, but the story is slow going. If you are a fan, you will not be disappointed, but now you will need to wait until next year for the resolution. Reel Dialogue: What are the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1.

112,bob-rutzel-239-525430,"It's Okay, but a Set-up for Sequels",7,6 August 2015,"This is the second story in the Divergent series. As you may recall, Tris (Woodley) is a Divergent and does not fit in with the normal factions in this dictatorial society. Government Head (Erudite) Jeanine (Kate Winslet) recovers a box that she believes is a message from the Founders, but the problem is only a Divergent can open it. Jeanine needs to capture Tris.To catch you up: the present government, in order to maintain the peace, divided the people by personality and aptitude and 5-factions resulted: Abnegation (selfless), Amity (peaceful), Candor (honest), Dauntless (brave), and Erudite (intelligent). Tris needs to bring down the present government and is not sure how to do this. Her mission is to kill the head of the snake, Jeanine (Kate Winslet).This is not as good as the first one (Divergent), but it's okay as it's basically a set-up for sequels. We see Tris and Four (Theo James) on the run for most of the movie. Then later, Tris turns herself in to Jeanine (Whaaaat?) and this is where the movie really starts.We see some pretty good CGI and can become confused whether some scenes are real or part of the Simulation when Tris is hooked up to Sim cables.The fight scenes are not as good as the fight scenes in Divergent and some of the shooting scenes will blow your mind as how the bad guys - with machine guns - cannot hit anyone who are clearly in their sights almost 10-feet away. This is Hollywood not realizing their mistake.Notables: Naomi Watts as Evelyn, Four's mother who wants to raise an army to defeat Jeanine; Ashley Judd as Tris' mother; and Daniel Dae Kim (from Hawaii 50) as Leader of Candor; Octavia Spenser as Joanna, leader of Amity; and Zoe Kravitz as Christina.The CGI throughout is spectacular especially when Tris is hooked up to the Sim cables.This movie is a set-up for later resolutions so there will be sequels.

113,prospectus_capricornium,Messy Plot and Underutilized Great Actors,5,18 March 2015,"'INSURGENT' picks up shortly after the events in 'Divergent' with obvious intentions to maintain, if not, speed up the momentum of the franchise. There's no doubt how fascinating the 'Divergent' universe is, and while it shares almost the same elements that made many of the YA franchises today, successful, the movie has its own unique facets to separate itself apart. Unfortunately in Insurgent, those elements aren't effectively explored and utilized.Once again, movie makers fall prey to this mentality or should I say practice, that seems to highlight the film's visual panache, but dismisses the utmost importance of effective storytelling. I think I've gone redundant here, but to be honest, Insurgent is no different, and if you'd allow me to make this honesty, even brutal, this Divergent sequel tracks a deteriorating trajectory, and you can imagine how the franchise is set to get even worse, knowing the last book of the trilogy is going to be split into two movies. This doesn't surprise me at all, given the fact how film makers has been consistently regarding these popular franchises as merely cash cows.In Insurgent, the plot thickens, and not just that, it branches out to several sub ones. That's when the film begins losing its grip around the central story, giving way to subplots that don't make sense at all, if not barely. As she searches for allies, crossing one faction's territony to another's, our titular heroine, Tris, finds herself in a cat-and-mouse chase with the enemy, in this case, Jeanine (Kate Winslet)—a name that Veronically Roth seems to suggest to be perfect for a character she molds as a super-villainess that embodies terror (am I being sarcastic? of course I....am. Lol..)—and her loyal erudite followers. Tris maintains reluctance, but when Jeanine turns toward her loved ones, our heroine succumbs and surrenders herself to the enemy. (this is so new).INSURGENT draws in more actors on its payroll to play new characters, but barely utilizes them up to their full capacity. In the end, it's Shailene Woodley that mostly does her job as the central character. On the film's key moments, she undoubtedly shines, only her efforts aren't enough to place the movie's charm to the same level as hers. No thanks to the chemistry the film seems to suggest Four and Tris have, because I don't think I felt it—it was missing. The action sequences are well played, I must say, and the visual effects borders extravagance, but against a weak and unfocused narrative, INSURGENT is a film you better just wait to come out on DVD, instead, and not one to waste time and money on.

The answer is a resounding yes, although there seemed to be a faster pace about this installment (the only positive).This installment continues the ridiculous idea that most of us are either kind, honest, brave etc and nothing else. A flawed idea from the outset, as very few would fit rigidly into one 'faction', not without some kind of psychological meltdown.Anyway, this installment continues the absurd notion that the lead character is a strong fighter. Most times she looks like she couldn't fight her way out of a paper bag, and her hair's nearly always immaculate - even after she butchers it with a pair of rusty old shears.In a nutshell, she's apparently the only one capable of passing some mind games contained in a box. This box was left by the founders of the faction system, and contains a message for them.Their founders must've been a bunch of loony tune scientists as well, as not only did they consider the factions system to be good, but they ensured their lovely box killed anyone who didn't pass their silly tests.Needless to say, pretty fighter girl passes the test, and it transpires that Divergents are the future of humanity (yep, the plot really is that lame).Not only that, but the rest of humanity's somewhere else.............probably laughing their socks off at the daft faction system they created.Ignore this massive turkey at all costs, and ignore the 6+ rating it has. These days I despair of the ratings, as some actually give crud like this 10 star ratings.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
116,stuart_davies,Ideal moralising tripe for weak minded youth with no imagination,1,13 July 2015,"If this exemplifies what youth culture is about, the human race is headed for an end where everyone turns into a spineless blob and dies from their continuously bleeding hearts.For fecks sake, the lead character feels remorse at having no choice but to kill her friend, fair enough, but to spend the entire first half of the movie whining on about it just got annoying.In a dystopia where the baddies are armed to the teeth, nobody carries a piece and get shot with darts that embed into the skin and nobody bats and eyelid or questions why that might be a bad thing until three peeps line up to throw themselves off a balcony.With too much posturing between male characters and too much self doubt and sacrifice from the heroine, the dialogue becomes wooden and lacking in any style.Finally after giving herself up like a sheep to the slaughter, the movie turns into the Matrix.Of course, the Divergent turn out to be the objective of a great experiment to see if the community is worthy of rejoining the outside world... Great experiment? What? Why?The rhetorical question I have is ""Was it really worth the effort?"" with the answer ""No it wasn't"".The first movie was intriguing, but this sequel is just a lame attempt to tie up the loose ends of the first.Oh and kids, if your find yourself in a future dystopia and someone threatens or tries to kill you, it really is better to shoot them in the head at the first opportunity. Thinking about fair play or being macho with hand to hand combat will only get you killed.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
117,Badmoviessuck,cliché af,3,5 December 2018,"This movie is cliché unoriginal and forgettable.CHARACTERS
Four is now pointless cause he is there cause he is Tris boyfriend.
all the development they gave Four just went away and he is now this one dimensional character who is just there to support Tris no matter what.
It would have been good to see some conflict with relationship instead of seeing them support each other 100% and love one and other 100%.
It would have been more genuine and real if we see some conflict it dosen't even have to be major it could be minimal.
Tris is this strong depressed woman that's all she is.
She is not as bad anymore but it felt like they showed how Tris dealt with the consequence's and then they just didn't expand on it for certain reasons.
The major events in Divergent are almost irrelevant cause they are mostly forgotten.
And that one dream scene where they showed Tris suffering with the consequence's was terrible.
They straight up said this cringe line ""You killed us all"" just a nitpick.ACTION
I love action scenes specially good ones.
But what i don't like is when an action scene deviates from the story
The action scenes are to much.
It's like every scene needs to have action and it makes the story worse.
instead of giving dialogue to the character they throw in an action scene.VERDICT
I don't have so much to say about this movie but it's bad.
I'm gonna review the last movie and i have seen RT score and it says that it's the worst of the bunch.
I will watch the movie to judge for myself",The Divergent Series - Insurgent

The plot, storyline, or whatever are close to nonsense or, at least, vague and superficial, and the action is all over the screen. I used to like watching ""superman"" or ""spiderman"", now: avengers, thor, ant-man, transformers are full of crap.

121,FandomFanatic21,One choice can destroy you...,8,21 April 2018,"Insurgent, is the second action packed installment in the Divergent Series. Insurgent, follows Tris and Four, followed by their faction friends after they escape the clutches of Erudite leader Jeanine whom wants to find all the divergent's to experiment on them so they can open the mysterious faction box which contains a secret of the city. Insurgent is definitely the most action filled though for me, was not as good as the first. Though, be prepared for shocking betrayals, new characters, and a whole new battle. If you want to uncover the secret of this dystopian society, you have to watch the movie and discover the secret for yourself.""We're on the same side, Tris. I'm Factionless because I don't fit into any one faction. And you're Divergent because you belong to too many. But we're both a threat to Jeanine.

'insurgent' unfortunately, did not have that same balance. I wouldn't say I was bored, per say, but definitely had trouble following the point. I don't remember the details of the 'insurgent' book but i'm almost positive it was more entertaining than this. I also don't appreciate the break down of the four and tris relationship. they bickered a lot in the last two books, but there's also a lot of love there, and i didn't feel it much here except for in one totally Hollywood scene that contradicts the books. (you'll see what i'm talking about)sorry, holding hands everywhere doesn't count as cute moments for me. also, there was great dialogue and banter from the book i recognized NOWHERE. disappointing. if they hated the 2nd book so much, why bother making it a movie? they should have picked a screenwriter who actually enjoyed it.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent

A young, unremarkable girl standing up against the regime. Sounds familiar? It should because at least half-dozen versions of this clichéd storyline have been released in the last 2-3 years. Why do they keep 'em coming? Thought you'd never ask. They make money (the last one made more than a billion dollars). The worst actor in the movie is actually the antagonist, Shailene Woodley. Just another pretty face, she lacks the feistiness of Jennifer Lawrence, and most of the times behaves like a pet cat instead of a fierce fighter. She spends most of her screen time cuddling with her boyfriend, played by Theo James, who has only one expression for every emotion in human life. Through out the movie, Shailene remains quite content playing the girl-with-the-bleeding-heart battering her perfect eyelashes with tears flowing down her cheeks. And you'd think that wanted fugitives have other priorities than just engaging in calf-love. The climax of the movie is a series of simulations, with some elaborate special effects, that Shailene must pass to achieve bull Nirvana.

126,h-62007-26888,What did you expect?,4,21 June 2021,"I saw the first Divergent a while ago and I did not enjoy it. Not total garbage, but still a bad film. So it comes to no surprise that I didn't have high expectations for Insurgent. But after watching Insurgent, I can proudly say that...my opinions have not changed. At all. In fact, I think I was right to have low expectations.In general, most of the pros and cons of Insurgent are similar to the first movie. Granted, the story did a better job explaining how some events took place and filled some plot holes and the pacing problem from before is completely gone, but the film still feels generic and kind of basic by how it still fills out all the cliches in the book. Not to mention also having other problems like lacking visual quality, poor characterizations, and the same problem from last time where it can feel derivative of other properties. I can tell it's trying to expand the world of Divergent, but it doesn't do a good job explaining what relevancy they have to the story.But like I said. While it contains most of the same problems as before, it also contains the strengths from last time. The action scenes are a lot of fun to watch, especially whenever Four would have to throw hands with a villain, and it's like I said where the pacing can be quicker since it has a much shorter running time. That, and once again, the actors are great fits for their roles, especially with the newcomers like Octavia Spencer and Naomi Watts. But still, the best performance goes to leading lady Shailene Woodley, who almost amplifies what she did to make her a high profile actress anybody should hire for their film. But does this help the film be better? Hell, no. And I wouldn't be too surprised if you continue going for these movies even after a third installment.Conclusion? Terrible story + good pacing + stale characterizations + attempts at development + passable action + fantastic acting + Shailene Woodley at her best + derivative nature + second movie = Insurgent.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent

In the book, there's a hard drive that contains the message. In the movie, it's replaced with the box that contains all sims of five factions. It's being done to reduce screen time, as the novel is quite long.The movie picks up where ""Divergent"" leaves. Tris and her allies try to hide from a faction leader named Jeanine. A mysterious box is kept at Erudite, which contains a message from the founders of Chicago. Only a Divergent can open the box and unleash the truth about the past.I love how this film surpasses the previous one in action sequences and some good amount of drama. My favorite scenes are the Amity chase scene, the Dauntless sim, and the Amity sims. The viewers also explore the settings of Amity, Candor, and the Factionless. I love the city-shattering scenes in Amity sims. The Dauntless sim is remarkable. It's where a flying burning house is prominently shown in trailers, and that's like a dream sequence but still very stunning to see. It's also notable that some characters' loyalties are confusing.

130,agblum,For the Most Part-Unsatisfying,7,19 March 2015,"""Insurgent"" is the 2nd Movie in the ""Divergent"" Series based on the popular trilogy of dystopian future novels. I have read the first 2 books – Loved the first One, Liked the story of the 2nd one, but felt it wasn't written as well. I thought the first movie was not great, but solid. I came into this movie hoping that it would improve upon both the first movie and the 2nd book. For the most part – I was not satisfied. This movie boosts a Great Cast – Including Shailene Woodly, Miles Teller, and Kate Winslet. They and some of the rest of the cast do have good moments, but the acting isn't always consistently good from scene to scene. Maybe it's them, maybe it's the Director, maybe it's both. But more that that, I was hoping the story would be constructed better that it was in the book. From what I can remember from reading it, they changed some things around, but it generally wasn't for the better. The last section of the movie is uplifting, but I just feel the movie had so much promise and for the most part doesn't deliver. Maybe it will improve upon second viewing for me, right now I just feel mostly dissatisfied with it. Like a number of recent film series based on novels, the last book, ""Allegiant"" will be split into 2 movies, released in 2016 and 2017-I hope for better- 2 ½ out of 4 Stars, 7 out of 10 Stars.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent

Twilight was...meh. Then they attempted to do The Host and that other movie with Lily Collins that was just horrid. So when Divergent came out I just couldn't take it. But I saw it and enjoyed it. The plot was very intriguing, despite Shailene Woodley. I don't know what it is but I feel like Hollywood is trying to make her the new Jennifer Lawrence and I don't endorse that idea.But....I had to see the sequel and let me say, this movie does not disappoint. I have never read the books and don't follow the blogs or anything and the plot is so interesting, I'm never sure where it's going to go so I was on the edge or my seat the entire. And dare I say it, Shailene Woodley has made a fan out of me because she shines in this movie. She is very convincing when she's vulnerable and emotional but equally as good when she has to be a tough fighter. The haircut grew on me as well.I'm certain that fans of the book will enjoy this film adaption but I think the general audience will enjoy it just as much. They're also not selfish with the action. I didn't realize how much action would be in this movie but was pleasantly surprised and eager to see more. The ending was definitely not something I expected and because of how it ended, I'm curious as to where the next two installments will go, I have an idea because Four's mother seems like a self-serving, deceitful beotch.Overall, without giving too much away, this movie will be a treat for everyone who loves science fiction that's not cheesy or predictable. the relationship between Tris and Four is not overdone or cheesy either. It's believable and doesn't annoy like a Bella, Edward and Jacob love triangle would. I would 100% recommend this movie to anybody. You won't be disappointed 4DX is not a bad way to watch a movie. I prefer the regular way and on a good day, 3D will suffice but my friend insisted we see it in 4DX and it added a special something to the overall experience.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent

So far, the first movie, Divergent, was following suit and I liked how the creators of the movie kept to the story of the book. However, I think I lost interest in the middle of the movie, with all that fighting and screaming and it just kept going on...and on.... So I think I just forgot to watch the sequel, this one, Insurgent. Surprise surprise, I liked it a whole lot more than I did the first one! Apart from the fighting, where I went to the loo, or in to the kitchen to get something, I enjoyed. The story is so together in this one. It's all about Triss finally getting to open the box. Simple. And then she opens it. And et voila - they all find out that the divergent are the important ones, that the whole thing has been an experiment from the world beyond. Etc. Yeah.

141,Drive-in_Zeppelin,Surely it can't be worse than the first one? Oh...,2,16 March 2015,"What's the main difference between Divergent and Insurgent you ask? With Divergent I got to heckle at the screen to my hearts content and shout profanities, because I was in the comfort of my own home. With Insurgent I was bound to socially acceptable behavior, since it was a free advance screening in a theater. When I say this is a bad series, I truly mean that there is nothing worthwhile to be taken away from either movie. The 2nd installment continues the overly convoluted and utterly senseless plot that pits our heroine Tris (Shailene Woodley) against a poorly defined villain and conflict. She is even less believable as the 'brave', tough-as-nails caste member she's been so effortlessly been trying to become, and then suddenly she exhibits all the other redeemable qualities that defines her as 'Divergent'? And I thought Twilight was awful...This second installment centers around...well nothing in particular. It basically picks up where the first one left off and Tris and company have to 'get back at the Jeanine' - the out of place cartoon villain. There's some magical box that's introduced as the MacGuffin device which ultimately unravels the already fragmented narrative. Don't worry, the sequel adds a whole new level of plot-holes to the already ridiculous premise. Gee, all that futuristic tech that wasn't in the first film looks awfully familiar to another teen-girl-turned- heroine young adult series. Characters? Development? Don't be preposterous! Those things don't exist in this movie. Just like the first film, you have painfully delivered dialogue that is more laughable than memorable. That forced romance from the first one? Yeah, you're just supposed to accept it in this one. (Sorry Four you're stuck with her for better or for worse). Honestly the only redeemable part of this hackneyed and clichéd movie is Miles Teller's character. He's seldom on screen and is only funny because he plays a total jerk. Let's hope no one notices that they're borrowing a lot of elements from other classic and popular dystopian stories. Logan's Run? That's about a marathon right? Nope, there are no isolated societies in Divergent/Insurgent. Hunger Games? No! This is a movie about an impractical futuristic society that segments parts society for the greater good. You must be mistaken. Oh wait...I made it through two and a half pitchers of beer, only drinking when there was something generally cringe-worthy on screen.

142,IanAJohnson,This film was enjoyable but messy.,5,30 March 2015,"Insurgent is the sequel Divergent and follows Tris and her friends as they attempt to prevent Jeanine from taking over all of the factions in the city and killing all Divergents. I rather enjoyed Insurgents predecessor, Divergent. Of all of the young adult book-to-film adaptions that are currently in progress (Hunger Games, Maze Runner, etc) it is my favorite. It was far from perfect, misplacing stupidity with bravery at times and taking quite a lot from Harry Potter; but it was a decent movie that brought me into its world and attached me to its characters. Insurgent continued many of its predecessor's strengths. The action scenes are well done and shot well without using shaky cam. There were new characters that interested me and added a bit to the world. The plot is kind of a mess, though. The first half of this film just sort of happens without any reasoning or main objective to focus on. As the film continues, inaccuracies from the first film begin to appear. The characters that I liked on the first film were stoic and didn't stand out like they did before. Some characters perform actions that don't quite make sense (like a villain shooting at a freight train from a distance with a pistol). A McGuffin is introduced, certain people have information that is suddenly important wasn't before and how they got this seemingly ancient information is left to the imagination. In short, the setup was kind of a mess. It didn't even reintroduce important plot points and left me a little lost. The second half of the movie picked up, though, and gained focus and kept me interested until the end. It had moments where I had no idea what was going to happen next and there was important character development for Tris. It also took a lot from other movies, too. While the first movie had several parallels to Harry Potter, this one has quite a few from the Matrix and Inception (as well as more from Harry Potter). The ending was quote poor in my opinion, and was quite similar to Maze Runner in that prior plot points don't seem to make sense and tie up with the ending. While it is possible that the next installment could answer many questions in a rational way, the ending just fell a little flat. I would go further in detail but that would reveal massive spoilers. Overall this movie is just okay. It isn't great, but it isn't bad. It is not as good as the first movie, but still fine.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
143,lonnielongino,Don't get the hate on this film!,8,20 May 2020,"Sure it's not perfect, neither was the first film. But what it is, a action filled dystopian after the war film, with an interesting story line. The underlying love story doesn't take away from keeping the action scenes up. Yes some of the action scenes are unbelievable but most are ""sim"" scenes and plot twists keep us interested. Not excellent but above average.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
144,isabelle-frater,Watchable,3,26 March 2015,"I sat in to see this movie with mixed feelings. I was pretty bored by the first movie, and I wasn't sure if I would be more entertained by the second. In the end, it was okay.Unlike the first movie, which had an interesting beginning, boring middle, and more exciting ending, this movie had a steady pace. While I wasn't at the edge of my seat, it was interesting enough to not cause me to start creating dishes for my other blog in my head. However, it wasn't exciting enough to actually make me feel.In the review of the previous movie I had a few questions. Now let's see if they were answered. - What is the wall for? - We sort of get an answer. - What is the rest of the world like, and why isn't anyone trying to find out? - We sort of get an answer for the first part, but not the second. It still doesn't make sense to me why people just take at face value that the world beyond the wall is terrible. On some of the shots there were clearly forests beyond the wall as well. There are always people in every group that see the horizon and just want to find out what is beyond it. Yet in 200 years apparently no one like that was born there. - Why are there still so many houses with holes in them? Shouldn't they have been repaired by now or torn down? - In this movie we see some new buildings as well. Now that I know it's been 200 years, I'm still wondering why the old ones aren't torn down or repaired? They would be dangerous. Falling debris all over the place! They could build a skyscraper taller than any other building, but not deal with the old ones? Makes no sense! - How long ago was this war thing, and what are the general facts about it? - We only learned that it was 200 years ago. So they think. Maybe not. - What are the Gryffindors, sorry, Dauntless protecting people from? It feels more like they're trying to control the people who like to climb on walls for no apparent reason, and don't know that there are mountains in the world. - Apparently, in this movie their role is to bully the other factions.The whole factions thing makes even less sense. From the movie it seems like the faction is innate. It has biological implications, because there are machines that can tell what you are. Now how is that possible? Really? Just think about it. There is no concrete biological indicator to a person's core personality. In fact, it's impossible to determine how much of who you are is genetics, and how much is experience. This world is inherently flawed in that way. In other books when there are such cast systems, they are a lot better explained. One way to go about it is like in The Hunger Games, or in real life, India. You are born into a group, and that is where you stay. Another way is interfering with nature. In Brave New World the development even as an embryo is carefully controlled, and when they are born, through conditioning and other methods reinforced. They interfere with nature and nurture to get the desired outcome. In this world, they do neither. Determining a faction based on just the dominant personality trait is very faulty, and makes absolutely zero sense. In fact, it's not feasible.The story itself was okay. Really not much to say about it. No great surprises, even though I never read the book. Okay, the plot point of the ""message"" was not something that can be foreseen, but everything else about it was obvious. Even the ending, though the precise message I wasn't able to determine, I knew it would say something similar. The ending scene left me questioning what they could possible put in the next movie. I guess I'll find out next year. I am a bit curious, but I'm working myself through A Dance with Dragons, and I intent to finish it before reading anything else.The actors, well, Tris didn't get any better. Not much in the passion, or smiling department. I get that she's supposed to be this tortured heroine, but the only time she seemed to actually show emotions was when she was trying to kill someone with her bare hands, or crying. Though the crying looked so awkward, I kept thinking that they should just make her stop. Four got a little better. We learned some of his story, and he also seemed to be more into Tris than she was into him. Though there were some nicer romantic moments, that almost made the whole movie better.Overall, it was an okay movie. I didn't hate it, just kept thinking how some parts of the story made no sense, and how some were weird. It's really watchable. The scenes were nicer than the previous movie, and there was also more action. I don't intend to rewatch it ever, but I'm glad that I saw it, because it would bug me after having seen the first movie.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
145,summerinertia,What were they smoking?,10,1 August 2015,"Well, well, well. Was this some kind of amateur demo reel? I claim the very dubious honour of having watched this...er...movie twice. Once with a friend and her kids; And again with my 14 year old. Of course it's a stinker. But then many movies that managed to attain cult status have been worse stinkers than this one ('The Birdpeople' for example). One method whereby movies rise to cult level is by negative recommendation. People tell friends how bad it is, and the friends watch it to see why. And I've certainly noticed a whole lot of negative comments regarding this movie. For a long time 'Twilight' was regaled as the worse series ever made. I and many of my acquaintances watched it just to see why it got that reputation. 'Twilight' now enjoys a modest cult following. Another contributing factor is unintentional humour. My second viewing of this movie had me chuckling at Lavagirl's shoddy makeover, and at some of the tacked in nonsense to show off the 3d effect (Sharkboy throwing a glass of water toward the audience during his ""dance"" routine, for example). Sometimes deviating radically from the ""norm"" can project a film into the realm of cult status also. This movie, while not engaging in major deviation, still has enough tedium about it to give it a little push away that direction. Who knows. Perhaps in the future, droves of teenagers (and maybe adults too) will throng to theatres late at night, 3d glasses in hand, garbage that makes this look halfway decent...as they do now for 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show'. Right now the future looks grim for this oddity, but I would certainly not be surprised to see it pop up out of nowhere sometime down the road.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent

147,film316-125-427677,Catching Fire,9,22 March 2015,"For those of you who missed the first one, Insurgent is the sequel to Divergent, Divergent is a series aimed at the new teen girl audience, so think Twilight and Hunger games and you are along the right lines. But the reel question is after the disappointment of Divergent will this second be a Maze Runner or just a Runner Runner? If you look at the poster for Insurgent it looks like it's been directed by the Wakoski brothers, with the two main leads free falling in air, shattered glass surrounding them with guns drawn, but the truth is that Insurgent is nowhere near as physisophrenic as any of the matrix movies. No, Insurgent is a film with it's head on it's shoulders and it's goals always in sight.I think it's this narrow mindedness that makes Insurgent worth watching, you can feel the movements are counting for something, they are part of a bigger scheme, it's not all juts random or pointless, every scene is measured to fit within it's play in the story and that story is buried within the many levels of social commentary that the movie makes.Insurgent never gives into the pressure of feeling like ""the middle child"" with not having any real beginning or end, that's the norm for movies like this, but not Insurgent. Instead it has a clearly defined beginning, middle and end, and just to help us along the setting changes for all three times. It's little things like that which can really lift a film out of the ordinary.Really we should credit the director Robert Schwentkes for this change. Schwentkes has had VERY mixed success, being responsible for last year's awful R.I.P.D. but before that the quite good Red and the very acceptable Time Traveller's Wife. In Insurgent it feels like Schwentkes has found his calling, he makes something as simple as a shower look incredible, with his expert eyes for framing, but it is in none reality when Insurgent really comes alive.For at least half the film Insurgent is set in this strange SIM reality which is made to test each of the abilities of a candidate. This setting is both surprising and engaging. I think that's a good way to describe all of Insurgent really. Surprising and Engaging.It's true Insurgent does not mind bringing out the big guns, with mass suicide being one of the major ones, the entire film has an air that anything could happen and in justice often does. I also like that all those things that no one really cared about from the original, for instance, all the different virtues of each discipline. Yeah that's mostly forgotten about in Insurgent and if not it's made REALLY clear what is required from the given party.It's interesting to me to see how the 3 main teen leads carry themselves and the film, Shaliene Woodly is clearly trying hard to bring out the level of talent that Jennifer Lawrence has as Tris. Theo James looks like he can have the only troubled expression on his face and nothing else and Miles Teller makes it all look so easy. As for the rest of the players they are all fine, especially Nomi Watt's who I personally didn't even recognise.The truth is that Insurgent is just flat out better than it's predecessor, it is succinct, clever, brave and beautiful, and I've got a feeling the best it yet to come.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
148,ahassan-12342,Four... (out of 10),4,24 March 2016,"Shailene Woodley deserves better in this listless sequel to Divergent, a dystopian future where the population is split into factions depending on one's character.Woodley plays Tris, a Divergent who does not fit into any of these overly-broad categories, is hunted by Kate Winslet's Jeanine following the events of the first film. The settings are more varied as we visit the settings of the other factions, from the rural life of Amity to the futuristic lair of Erudite. However, the direction verges from muddled to ludicrous as characters' actions become increasingly baffling as the film progresses. In particular, there is one elongated scene set in a train carriage that stands-out in it's silliness; it involves a lot of fists and little sense.Insurgent picks up somewhat towards the end, leaving enough intrigue for the the follow-up.

150,Challenger2013,"Better than ""Divergent"" but Could Still Use Some Work",7,25 March 2015,"When I saw ""Divergent"" a year ago, I thought it was an unoriginal and corny disappointment. I had never read any of the books, but had heard great things about them. Insurgent is a nice step up from Divergent and it achieves this by raising the stakes, leaving out the boring informational crap, and upping the action so it is actually exciting. It is nearly impossible to watch this series and NOT compare it to the ""Hunger Games"" series. ""The Hunger Games"" was lightyears ahead of ""Divergent,"" and every film in the ""Hunger Games"" series to date is still better than ""Insurgent,"" but it seems like this Shailene Woodley led series is heading in the right direction. Speaking of Woodley, she has got some chops. She makes the most of a somewhat lackluster script by showing some true emotion and displaying some true, well-done acting. She could definitely have a great future in film and may even have a couple dates with Oscar one day as she seeks out more films like The Descendants and The Fault in Our Stars. Another fine performance in the film comes from the always-great Kate Winslet, who provides us with an interesting and hate-able villain. Miles Teller is also fun to watch in this one, which I found to be a pleasant surprise, not because he isn't a good actor but because I hated his character in the first film. The camera work in the film is interesting. There are definitely some risks; sometimes they pay off and sometimes they don't. At times, the cinematography seems surprisingly good for this type of film, but at other times it seems as if the filmmakers were trying a little too hard. The main problems with the film are in the plot, which could be huge. Luckily, the plot holes and strange ending don't take too much away from the overall effect. The biggest issue I had was that after all was said and done, the film did not excite me for the next installment in the franchise and I'm really not to eager to see where this story goes. Still, if the next film makes the types of improvements this one made from ""Divergent,"" this could go down as a fairly good franchise.

My 18 year old daughter emphasized that these type of movies are simply not tailored to the taste of middle-aged gents, and sure she was right. The entire movie - save for some impressive CGI - feels like brewing a cup of coffee by hand having the filter fold and having a watered down cup of something as result. Plenty of action, but no suspense. There is simply no feeling the dystopian world itself exists outside the studio's interior and the heroine is just another big-eyed babe with made-belief toughness. These type of movies need rougher edges, real bad-ass opponents (Kate Winslet, give me a break) , a better pacing and less running around within studio's.

It helps that I love this type of movie and I was not disappointed. It certainly reminds you of Hunger Games and movies such as Maze Runner so it's a 'sit back and enjoy the ride' type of movie. Action packed with fantastic special effects, the movie takes up exactly where Divergent leaves off, and so flows effortlessly. Tris played by Shailene Woodley and her boyfriend/partner Four played by Theo James are very credible as a couple fighting Janene played by Kate Winslet the Leader of the five Factions. I like seeing Kate in this role as it's different for her, but she plays a great bad guy.

Watching the movie is simply a formality; the destination is known. The second problem is the ponderous pace at which this movie moves; there are many seriously slow sequences which hold little importance to the plot. Put another way, this was filled with self-indulgent scenes that were about as interesting as watching paint dry. Contrasted with the action scenes which are good but too few to keep interest. Setting up the factionless in a dis-used power station seems very predictable too. Just saying... One part of the story that confused me was Caleb's departure which left me wondering why the character even existed (apart from the eye- candy factor)?!?So in summary, Insurgent is a ""dog with fleas"" which should be avoided. If you haven't seen the first movie (Divergent) in the series, the ""so far"" story is presented poorly; almost as a reminder to those who have seen it. If you haven't seen ""Divergent"" and don't understand ""Insurgent"" its not your fault; its just all been done soooo poorly..",The Divergent Series - Insurgent

But when she did do the sims for the box thing I found that awesome.Everyone was awesome in their roles, once again Kate and Shailene shone. But I also loved Octavia as she really showed what a true Amity leader would be like. I also loved when they went into Candor and Tris and Four were on trial. I particularly loved seeing Candor as I imagine I would have chosen that particular faction if I was in that world.Props to Robert Schwentke for a perfect sequel that (like its predecessor) has me craving more.

157,SConIrish,"Insurgent plays like a series of set-pieces designed to create a substantive whole, yet the end result leaves you unfulfilled.",6,24 March 2015,"The second installment in the dystopian franchise I suspect will not disappoint fans of Veronica Roth's young adult fiction trilogy. However for the general moviegoer the film though well mounted feels engineered and orchestrated, Insurgent plays like a series of set- pieces designed to create a substantive whole, yet the end result leaves you unfulfilled. We pick up with Tris (Shailene Woodley) experiencing nightmares, when we left her in last years Divergent her parents had been murdered in front of her, she has been left without a faction and forced to go on the run with Four (Theo James). Insurgent picks up in the peaceful commune/faction Amity where Tris, Four, Caleb and Peter have sought sanctuary. This is short lived as enemy soldiers led by Eric (Jay Courtney) discover their hiding place and mayhem follows. An impressive action scene involving a fast moving train and gunfire provides a hope for a more exhilarating experience than what is delivered. The film follows Tris and Four as they make their way back to the city to do battle with the malevolent Jeanine (Kate Winslett). She wants a Divergent to unlock the secrets inside a mystical box, that is supposedly from the founding fathers. On the way back Four/Tobias meets his estranged mother Evelyn (Naomi Watts) ""I always loved to watch him sleep,"" and Tris must battle her demons to prevail against the dark forces. Other factions come into play including Candor and Erudite but if you are not familiar with the codes and language of this world it doesn't really matter. Replacing Neil Burger (Limitless) in the directors chair, Robert Schwenke (Red/Flightplan), brings a technical efficiency to proceedings. Fight scenes are efficiently choreographed and the use of CGI is appropriate to the demands of the story. Three writers are responsible for reducing Roth's complex story to under two hours, including Goldsman (A Beautiful Mind) and Mark Bomback (Dawn of the Planet of the Apes). Woodley holds everything together with her commitment to making Tris a complex, kick ass heroine. Miles Teller has fun as the ambiguous Peter who struggles to reconcile which side he is playing for. The prospect of two final installments sounds as if the producers are stretching a concept remarkably thin for the purpose of making a small fortune",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
158,just_for_movies,Better than the first but still has some flaws.,7,20 March 2015,"Insurgent is much better than the first film in the series but it still has its flaws throughout. While it is much more intense and gripping than Divergent, the plot is still a mess and the dialogue is very clichéd.This movie is based off of the popular Divergent Series. Personally I have read the first two books and wasn't overly impressed by them. I watched the first movie and thought it was very bland and now here we are at the second movie. Let's start off by saying the movie is very different from the books. Some of the changes I liked and some of the changes were just dumb. The plot in general is still convoluted and just not easy to follow. I felt like the first movie was a rip-off of the Hunger Games series and with the second I still think that but with less confidence than before. For one, I think the world built inside the Divergent series is much more interesting than The Hunger Games. Moving on to the actual story (script). The main problem here is the dialogue and while I thought it was going to be much worse, there were still some lines that were painfully clichéd. I don't have much to say about the acting in this movie because in all honesty, it's nothing special, but it's also far from terrible. As for directing, I think the director did a very good job.Two things I want to touch on is the music and cinematography. The music I thought was excellent and fit the movie perfectly. but what really blew me away on this movie is the cinematography. It was amazing. Really, it was some of the best I've seen in recent movies. Congrats to you Florian Ballhaus.Finally we come to the CGI and action. The first movie had a minimal amount of both and that's what made it kind of bland. But this film just raised the bar with the action and CGI. And ultimately, it made it more intense. The action is definitely very fun to watch but what makes the action scenes fun to watch is the CGI. And I'm particularly talking about the end. No spoilers but the end is just packed with crazy visual effects. And while the visual effects were spectacular to look at, some of it was pretty bad. I mean there was a ton of visual effects and they were generally well done, but some of it was so obvious that it was shot on a green screen that it was almost cringeworthy. In the end, Insurgent was much better than the first movie but still had bad dialogue and a complex plot. On the plus side it had great music, phenomenal cinematography, and fun CGI eye-candy that was quite good. I was pleasantly surprised that I liked this movie.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent

163,YoungCriticMovies,Insolent: A New Director Goes Off the Rails To Appeal to the Masses and Make More Money,5,7 April 2015,"Hollywood loves money. But we've known that for years; since Hollywood's beginnings in the Golden State. Last year Divergent set up a movie franchise that looked to follow the success of The Hunger Games and Harry Potter. The first film was a success not only commercially, but cinematically as well. Director Neil Burger captured the Young Adult novel feel and dealt with the adaptation expertly and passionately; and the audience saw that. The audience can tell when a movie has been made with love and when it had been made for money. Unfortunately with Divergent's sequel, Insurgent, a change in director and strategy has led the franchise astray, into the greedy realms of Hollywood.Insurgent picks off where Divergent left off, naturally. The once peaceful apocalyptic city of Chicago has been thrown into chaos. The factions that had been made to divide people and their roles in society, trembles and is on the verge of breaking. Our heroes Tris (Shailene Woodley) and Four (Theo James) seek refuge from the evil ""President Snow-like"" Jeanine (Kate Winslet). Jeanine is hunting Four, Tris, and other escapees from the Dauntless faction who uncovered her evil plan to establish herself as a dictator. Four and Tris, along with Peter (Miles Teller) and Tris' brother Caleb (Ansel Elgort) are looking to join up with the rest of the Dauntless. The plot thickens and there are various back-stabbings, near deaths, and a lot of fights. The franchise however has taken a step in the wrong direction in trying to appeal to the general audience, seeking more eye-candy and action sequences. You can almost tell (without having read the book) that director Robert Schwentke is going off his book source. The buff-up plan includes: cast additions to add star power (Octavia Spencer and Naomi Watts), early-on and ubiquitous fight sequences, and (this is debatable) female objectification.Now, females in cinema are, and always have been, extremely objectified, so there's no point in justifying that this film shows this for the first time. But the film does find extra guilt in that it stands as a PG-13 film. Fast & Furious is R, the audience is mature and goes in expecting women to be treated that way, but the Insurgent audience is made up of forming tweens and teenagers that aren't expecting anything more than a passionate kiss. Sex scenes and girls in crop-tops, completely throws off the ""woman-power"" feel that the first film achieved.Then we have the fight sequences, which are forced upon us every 2 minutes, at which point you begin to feel as if the writers got lazy and stopped writing dialogue. The CGI is used forcefully as well; you lose interest in the story and are simply lost in floating, crumbling cement houses. Through that the sake of logic and even interest in developing or exploring characters is been completely lost. And when you lose characters, you lose the whole story.As for the added star power, it's completely unnecessary. You have Oscar winner Octavia Spencer and Oscar nominee Naomi Watts in roles whom barely take up 15 minutes of movie time combined. It's a waste and a silly excuse to add more names to your movie poster.The acting was handled terribly. The entire supporting cast is given a script with adialogue that is so scrappy that they themselves don't know what they're saying. The poor Theo James, Ansel Elgort, and even Naomi Watts struggle hard to make sense to the audience. The only actors who manage to save themselves due to obvious improvisation and skill are Shailene Woodley and Miles Teller; two of the biggest rising stars of today whose charisma keeps the film together.I have to say the only aspect that saves the film is the ending. The film deviates from the dreadful mainstream course and goes back to adapting the final pages of the book. Of course the credit here goes entirely to the author Veronica Roth, but nonetheless it helps make the film edible, and at least leaves you with a good aftertaste.

I just think Tris and Four were ill-suited as a pair.Cons:totally unoriginal!!!!! It's harry potter and the deathly hallows part 2 all over again except in a different context. Along with similar recurring themes of those in all teen dystopia.some weirdnesses: some of the action scenes in the test made me feel... uncomfortable I guess. Some were just weird.some moments were overexaggerated, unrealistic and cliché.the violence - what is with the violence? It's overboard in this one. Seriously, the violence in this one is traumatising.some characters were unconvincing and bland.I think Tris' hair was terrible. Her character was also kind of terrible in this one too. She's constantly on edge and I mean isn't she supposed to be a divergent? She clearly doesn't fit into amity as observed in the start of the film. I understand that she is obviously suffering from PTSD or something of the sort, but it seems to me that she is only a divergent when the director (or whoever) wants to show us that she is.the ending was great but... it seemed like a conclusion to the whole series for me, no third movie/book was needed.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent

170,Old_Man_From_Scene_24,The clichéd formula of teenage tripe,3,20 March 2015,"That summary does not mean I find work aimed towards teenagers awful as a rule; I don't generalise. It simply means it's another addition to the genre of 'teenage fiction' which is so poor it deserves to be labelled as ""tripe"" in and of itself. The Divergent series is based on books of the same name, which means right from the off many of us who haven't read said books knew there would be a devoted fanbase to the series. I don't begrudge those fans their opinions and I can't speak for how this movie works as an adaptation. What I CAN do is summarise its effectiveness, appeal and overall enjoyability as a stand-alone piece of cinematography. And on the whole, I am thoroughly amused. In a pitying way.The characters have zero appeal because we've seen them all before; the 'deer in the headlights' type of teenage lead, the heartless and shallow 'arch enemy' and an ensemble of clichés, including, but not limited to: the male warrior and sex appeal, the small group of 'enlightened' protagonists, the gormless population living under heel, etcetera, etcetera. I had an issue with the distinct lack of originality in the first movie, with it bearing notable similarities to Huxley's 'Brave New World' and Orwell's '1984', not to mention the more recent 'Hunger Games' and other pieces of dystopian fiction. The point is, the movie stands on the work of other successful franchises - whether novels or movies - and allows those series to lay the groundwork for what it portrays as a ""rip-roaring fight against tyranny"", but which is, in reality, another slug-fest of brainless acting, numbing action and unoriginal plot points. I'm not going to say anything overly negative against Shailene Woodley, as I've yet to see her in anything but this series, but I'm unimpressed with her acting potential thus far. She isn't helped by the poor script and mediocre directing, so I won't be too critical, but by this stage I'm not holding my hopes up for an up-and-comer in anything beyond typecast roles in future productions. The acting of the support cast is what you might expect - an attempt to appeal to the youthful masses and bearing no distinctly original traits of their own in any sense whatsoever. The worst part has to be the story. The simple motive is, if you've seen it in dystopian features, you'll probably see it in the Divergent series. The basic structure is flimsy with regards to the ""castes"" (Huxley fans will see what I did there) that people are forced to choose and the idea of a rebellion against the oligarchy portrayed is so clichéd that it just doesn't hold any interest. In fact, you might be able to accurately predict the majority of events which transpire in this film and as any movie-goer will tell you, that is NEVER a good thing. We need originality and we aren't given it by any stretch of the imagination.Action flicks for teenagers need a new format if they're going to survive, I feel, and this does nothing to refresh the genre. On the contrary, it's rather like dragging a dead horse into the town square and then repeatedly whipping it for laughs. Although the only laughs are mine, and they're painful. If you're a fan of the novels or someone seeking pointless cinematic thrills you might enjoy this, but if you have a refined taste in films or are expecting to see something worth the popcorn, I advise you to flee. Not walk away, but literally flee with cheetah-like pace and don't look back.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
171,pierce-declase,A decent sequel,7,3 April 2015,"When i watched divergent i had no clue what it was about, i had no clue it was a book. Only after i found out it was a three book series and that we would be get 3 more films, putting the last movie as a two part. Trust. But its a decision i'm happy with. I enjoyed the first film. I walked out pleased at what i saw. I enjoyed the story plot, the whole set up and design of the story. I was interested. So a year later we get Insurgent the sequel. I did not think much going into this film. Unfortunately i saw bad reviews for this movie. So i go watch it. Yes this film is good, just good. I feel not much really happen but more of a set up. But its really cool in its own way. We get introduced to many new characters which now will have some sort of meaning in the next films. I feel this film struggled to really do that with certain characters. That's its downfall. Other than Tris we do not really connect with anyone else.Four has his moments but fails to really bring us into his world. But you will feel for him, i promise you that. Well he will be i think. The point is that with all these new characters they have something they can build off. I feel this sequel was decent to good and served the series well. I feel the next films will be a change up and i am interested to see what happens. The next movie has to be a good movie of i feel this series could slide away, the first two now have been decent films with potential. I feel the third has to do well. With all these new characters and the changes it could deliver something more and maybe different. I'm worried it may over blast us with content but the two film split was good. With all these new characters now around they need to find a way to connect us all to them. I know its massive group but focus on a core bunch. We really need more than Tris and Four. Even though Tris is the star of the film. That scene! Anyways I'm sure you will enjoy this film.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
172,alexgarcia732805,Half-Assed Acting+Rushed Pace+Clichés=Insurgent,5,5 April 2015,"I read all the Divergent books (including ""Four"") and I watched the Divergent movie. Now, some say that Insurgent is a better movie than Divergent. But even if it was, that's not much of an accomplishment. In Divergent, at least we got sufficient time to be introduced to and spend time with the characters. Also, the action sequences in the first film were kind of worthwhile. But this sequel is just too quick- paced and too desperate to move from one scene to another. I feel like everyone involved with ""Insurgent"" simply wanted to get it over with, so they could get cash in on the two-parter conclusion (Allegiant). Insurgent simply spends too much time advancing plot instead of spending meaningful time with the characters. Insurgent has some impressive simulation scenes. While some simulations in the movie weren't in the book, I didn't really care that much because the sims were interesting. We see more of this universe's dystopian Chicago, however it feels like a retread of what we've seen before. Not all the casting decisions in this movie were bad. (But Four's mother looking younger than him? Really?) However, the half-assed acting (from a majority of the actors, but not all), the rushed pace, the lack of character development and a general sense of unoriginality really bring the film down. With the first movie, audiences were somewhat obligated to give the new Divergent franchise a chance--but I feel like because of Insurgent that was one chance too many. If you liked Divergent, then by all means, watch ""Insurgent"". You'll probably like this movie. *Everyone says that Shailene Woodley ""carried"" this movie. But I personally think she simply wasn't as bad as everyone else. Her performance in the 1st film was better. *While Theo James might be a convincing Four, that doesn't mean he's a relatable or very interesting Four. (Or should I say...Tobias Eaton!) *I think Caleb (Ansel Elgort) should be killed off, because he seems completely expendable. Ansel Elgort looks REALLY bored and emotionless throughout the entire film; he has a blank, vacant facial expression in his scenes, in promotional photos, etc. He isn't needed enough to warrant him being in this franchise, and is only there because Tris needs him to be--the plot doesn't really need him and neither does the audience. But maybe money and/or contractual obligations are the real reasons. *Jai Courtney is very capable in his villainous role, he makes Eric a captivating character. Nevertheless, he had more potential. *Kate Winslet is a lot less likable in Insurgent than in Divergent. All Jeanine does is stand around stoic-faced and say a few menacing lines. *Peter (Miles Teller) has too many sardonic one- liners, and could've been more of a funny anti-hero than he was. The relationship between Tris and Four is really rushed. It is never given enough development (though at least their romance isn't Insurgent's primary focus). ***Minor SPOILERS***While I can see why there might be some attraction between the two, I think them having sex was unwarranted. How long have they known each other--a month? Apparently, Veronica Roth and the people behind Insurgent think that all teenagers are h0rny and sexually deprived. (By the way, I'm a teenager too, so I'm not unjustly generalizing an entire age group.) ***End of Minor Spoilers***Insurgent is anticlimactic. It's not always--but it is too often-- dull & boring. I am probably being too negative about Insurgent, but after seeing so many mediocre YA novel adaptations, I'm not very accepting of them anymore. After two relatively disappointing films, I'm not sure the next two Divergent installments (Allegiant, Part 1 and 2) will be any better. Out of all the franchises I have seen split their finales into multiple films (Fast & Furious, Twilight, Harry Potter, THG, The Avengers: Infinity War) Divergent is the least deserving. With such little emphasis put on characters (something of a problem with ""The Hunger Games"" series, but to a lesser extent), I really doubt that the Allegiant book adaptation will be bearable. Some fans don't even like the Allegiant book very much, so I think that the director and producers of Allegiant will need a lot of luck if they're to turn this franchise around.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
173,costakcpc,Give me more,6,26 September 2016,"Apparently there's a sex scene in Insurgent. It shows a little flesh, it's nicely shot and it's over very quickly. For me that sums up Insurgent and the whole series really. It's nicely shot but it only ever offers glimpses into character and motive. And when the characters do talk you only get snippets of what's going on. In the end it leaves you wanting more. The main character Tris is neither a leader nor someone struggling to come to terms with being divergent. She gives no great rallying speeches, she offers no great one liners of inspiration and hope, she mainly stares and runs. I'd love to know what's going on in her mind! Once again, I'm left wanting more.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
174,lhrlinha,A bigger sequel. That's it.,6,19 March 2015,"Insurgent continues right after the ending of the first movie, with Tris and her companions looking for refuge from the attacks of the Erudites commanded by Jeanine. If you didn't watch the first movie, and I don't know why you would want to watch this one, you will probably feel a bit lost, especially since the plot gets even more complicated than the one from the first movie. They do give little hints from flashbacks and information slips during the dialog to try and help without diminishing the pace of the movie. And what a frenetic pace.The characters are always running for their lives, or hiding, or being charged with crimes, or dreaming. Early on in the movie there is an action scene, and right when you think it's over and you will be able to relax, BAM, new problem only solved through punching. The only stops are for the much needed dialogs, a weak B story, and for Tris to deal with the weight of being a divergent and its consequences to the world. By the way, Shailene Woodley does a great job as Tris and owns it (the rest of the cast is just fine). You should not be bored in this movie. The pace, coupled with big special effects may make you feel excited at times. The action camera is pretty decent to, showing the action, but it does fall for the ""fast cuts"" trap at times, and you can't see exactly who is punching whom. The major problem here is the story, which at times feels a little convoluted. It was interesting seeing a little bit more of the ""less important"" factions that we didn't get to see in the first movie. For instance how they deal with problems: Amity hopes they go away on their own and Candid with their justice morals.But we lost character development or a great finale. The writers had to do some tweaking to get the book into a movie. Some information and conflicts that were in the book are not there, so some developments feel a bit rushed or not as significant as they did not have time to grow. Parts of the story felt like they were put aside or dragged on just to show a feel more cool special effects, which, I can't believe I am actually saying this, felt unnecessary. Like they are showing off so you feel good about spending money to watch this in a movie theater. And because of that, they don't feel as exciting, or relevant. Take for instance 'Inception', which had special effects for similar story reasons. There, they had a purpose. The room was turning because outside the dreamer's body was turning. And it affected the outcome of the action: How to drop someone when there is no gravity? Here the effects are distracting and kind of repetitive, they just... were there. And if not for the last 30 seconds, it would seem the franchise could have ended here. The way it was done, there would be no need for two more sequels. In the end, if you've seen the first one and enjoyed it, you should watch this one. At least to know how it goes. It's bigger, not necessarily better, yet you should have some fun. But if you are not that excited, wait for the DVD. Or the Bluray, and you can see all the effects better.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent

So many clichés, but even worse. For example, a group of trained professionals shoots at people running towards the train. Shooters are basically hidden in the woods and shooting the runners, they don't hit anyone, but the runners shoot back (with no aim basically) and manage to shoot some. Facepalm #1.Later there is another scene where these ""runners"" are attacked by armed professionals. They appear in groups and descend on the roof of a building by some ropes, as they are shooting at these runners. They can't hit a single person out of three, although they are running away from them in a straight line.

The soundtrack is really good, the sets are very well constructed, the special effects were also amazing, and the overall message is beautiful. There's some similarities between Divergent series and The Hunger Games series but they're still completely different entities. I have seen this movie three times and I still have no clue why it's so hated. The plot is sometimes rushed but it's nothing entirely awful. I thought the ending was good and was appropriate.

177,matrixpolaris,"It's better than the first one, but that's not really a compliment.",5,26 November 2016,"The first one was okay. It's a good film if you have 2 hours to kill, but if you want a quality film, then it's not for you. And the same counts for this one.Let's start with the positives. While the action in the first one was just a little meh, the action is amped up in this one, and the result is excellent. The train fight was stunning, the small duel between Tris and Peter is great, and so are the others. The acting is sorta good as well. Shailene gives a solid performance, and Miles Teller is also great. The scale and scope of this film is much larger than its predecessor, and the effects are much better, and less noticeable, and it's altogether a better film.But it's also got some negatives. Why are they here? Why do the factions work? What if you're both kind and selfless, and does that make you Divergent? What happened? All these questions were left unanswered in the first film, and still weren't answered in this one. The same thing happened with the Maze Runner, and seemingly with all YA films. While that does leave to theorize what happens next, it's sort of annoying not knowing what happened. Also, why trust Peter? He beat you up, and tried to kill you in the first film, he betrayed you to Jeanine TWICE, and you still trust him. Tris, you are an idiot. The plot is pretty bad, and the video recording is taken straight out of The Maze Runner. Both of these films are generic, and are almost indistinguishable from The Hunger Games, Maze Runner, and even Harry Potter. When will they come up with something original?This film is fun, no doubt about it, but it's not really worth it. Watch the Hunger Games instead.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent

179,briancseel,Hunger Games + The Matrix,2,25 January 2018,"It is clear these books were rushed out as a copy cat hoping to capitalize on the wildly successful Hunger Games series. The formula was the same. A dystopian future society where people have been arbitrarily divided and oppressed and a young girl who is ready to challenge the whole thing. Hunger Games was much more thoughtful and layered, however. At its core it was a story about totalitarian regimes based on Susan Collins very real experience of living in a communist country as a military brat growing up. Divergent lacked any such layers or depth, but did in some ways make for a more entertaining movie. But at its core it was essentially just a high school coming of age story masquerading as Sci-Fi. You had the high school cliques - the jocks, the nerds, the hippies, the do-gooders and you have Tris Prior who doesn't seem to belong to any one group and is ""factionless"" (which in dystopian future Chicago seems to be the equivalent of having to sit alone at lunch).Divergent also gets points for all of the guys around our female heroine not being totally worthless, Four is quite capable and Peter proves himself to be of some use in Insurgent. But Tris is not going to be content to shoot a bow & arrow from a distance. That more believable combat is traded for Tris routinely beating up men with ease, which always strains credibility. The love story is better in Divergent, as at least our young heroine doesn't fall for a completely useful wet noodle of a guy. My praise ends there, however, as the story at its core makes zero sense. Essentially 200 years ago, founders created an ""experiment"" that they would not live to see the outcome of and apparently expected to fail. That experiment is in full on failure as ""Jeanine"" (has there been a worse name for a villain in movie history?) is seeking to crack down on the Divergents and maintain power over the 3 remaining factions (we did away with 2 in the first movie and yet nobody in the remaining 3 factions seems to think that anything is amiss).But Jeanine is going be challenged by a teenage girl who in true Joan of Arc style (the original Katniss Everdeen) is set to rally an army with her boyfriend Four and the help of his mother, played by Naomi Watts, exactly 16 years older than Theo James. Seems plausible, but not if you age like a Hollywood actress, she looks like his big sister.The movie spends the last half ripping off The Matrix, including the scene where Neo dies, in order for Katniss, er Tris to fulfill her destiny of decoding the founders message. We imprison Jeanine at the end, thus we are 2 movies ahead of the Hunger Games which might explain why there is no box office rationale for the 4th film which would complete the series.Although of course, we can't just imprison Jeanine, because presumably Four's mom now wants to take up the Juliane Moore role of dictatorette.Divergent had enough action and pace to warrant cinematic consideration, but the weak foundation of the series cannot support two stories. Other than getting to live in dystopian Chicago, it is unclear what benefit Jeanine actually receives by oppressing 5 factions of people.As others have noted, the zombie train system makes no sense and for being a totalitarian state, the government in Insurgent is decidedly void of surveillance technology. If you liked Divergent, stop there, leave it at that, and take the wins when you can get them.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent

I actually really enjoyed the first film. Read the books and enjoyed...well at least the first two anyway.The insurgent film is ""inspired"" by the Veronica Roth Novel of the same name. To say the film is based on the books is a gross overestimation of the screen writers abilities to adapt a novel and the directors ability to put together a story that is rational and explicable. Nothing in this film makes sense. Especially not in comparison to the books and there several Atlantic ocean sized plot holes.The film opens with our heroes on their way to Amity, which is more or less where the similarities with the book end. There is no explanation of who Joanna is, no explanation of why they are there or the terms under which they may stay. Tris is messed up but there is no character development between her and Four that truly explains any of that. All of the trust issues between Tris and Four as well as Tris's reckless desire for self destruction are left out of the entire film. Tris does not save Peters life in Amity and she is also fine with guns and killing people despite barely being able to touch a gun in the book!Nothing about the plot is quite right. It's fragmented and jumbled. The director tries to tell a story much different than Insurgent but keep parts of the plot that belong to the book. Events in the book happen, like seeking shelter in Candor but they don't make sense and are twisted in such a way that they don't resemble either the film or the book. A great example is the fake death scene. A pivotal scene in the book. Misplaced and totally nonsensical in the film. The real reason for the ""faked death"" was down to the fact that Jeanine couldn't control Tris. Tris broke every simulation because she was always aware she was in a simulation. Tris broke Jeanine in the end and Jeanine decided to have her executed. She is saved by Peter (because he didn't want to be in her debt) and Cara (a character who doesn't exist in the films but becomes pivotal in the next). The whole point then being that Tris, four and peter ESCAPE Erudite headquarters and make it to Abnegation.In the film no explanation is given. She is suddenly dead, which Jeanine did not want and then she is alive and there is no attempt at escape. Pointless, inexplicable lunacy from both the director and the screenwriters.The longer the film went on the more frustrated and annoyed I became with its shear lack of consistency and fluidity.

Woodley? No. She doesn't have tiny bit of muscle in her to punch any professional guards. Jennifer Lawrence could show some attitude, but Shailene Woodley?

With bad casting and story, nothing is left for viewers to watch.This movie has great CGI works. All those debris and everything, for few minutes made me remember about the world of ""The Last of Us"". But, if there is no good story, all these CGI effects won't ever be enough, no matter how good those are. But, hats off to the people who did a great work, and they shouldn't be chastised for weak stories and characters.This is why, I gave the movie ""3"" rating. I really wish, great CGI works come along with great memorable story, like in ""Life of Pi"", but not this kind of worthless film.So, movie makers, time to get new ideas.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
184,qadreya,"Slow, but good",7,30 March 2015,"As far as the plot goes, this was slow. There was not any major development in the story line, just the same old 'capture the heroes' 'heroes face danger' 'heroes deal with unexpected enemy' and such. Almost everything felt expected and nothing felt original, of course the hero will be 'the one'. The action sequences were pretty good, there were a few and they were all much better than I expected it to be. Even the action sequences that were 'divergent only' were pretty good, like the scene in the trailer. Don't get me wrong, there were developments, like the introduction of three new characters and new places. But even with all that, it still was not enough.. they could have done a better job in this movie to avoid splitting the last movie in two parts. Finally, about the actors, everyone did a good job staying true to their character. Two people were perhaps the most annoying because they lacked facial expressions, in fact they only had three: sad, upset and neutral. And those two actors were Shailene and Ansel. All in all, it was a good movie, a bit long and sometimes boring.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent

186,Karin_Reimertz,Avoid the movie – read the book.,2,21 September 2015,"I really liked Divergent, and it inspired me to read the whole trilogy. I knew already when I sat down to watch Insurgent that it would be a very ""loosely based"" movie of the book and didn't really have a problem with that. What I just can't get my head around is why they have taken a story with such an interesting lead role as Tris and transformed her into something not even remotely like her original self. In the book she is this strong, brave and still a very human person. She's not afraid to rush into danger, but she also battles with regret and pain. She's sometimes hasty in her decisions but at also the one to step back, to take her time and trying to take all pieces of the puzzle into consideration. In the movie she has transformed to a stereotype woman from any movie made in the 50's and completely been stripped off of both her humanity and her smartness which made her really boring and stupid and completely uninteresting to watch.The actors all act way below the first movie (where they uninspired too?) and most of the time they speak with little or no emotion, making it sound like they are just reading their lines of a paper for the first time. None of them felt sincere or true, it just felt like a lot of acting. And not of the good kind.The story is – as stated – loosely based on the original, and once again I ask myself ""Why?"". Why take a good but complicated story and turn it into something simpler – yes – but still with more plot holes than a good Belgian cheese?Veronica Roth must have been paid a lot to agree with this. I surely hope she was. And I surely hope the writers and producers of the upcoming films realize that maybe sticking to the story might be a better idea. There's a reason this trilogy has sold as good as it has – and surprise, surprise – it is not because the story needs changing. Avoid the movie – read the book.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
187,idoyam,Divergent Who? Insurgent Is the New Hit!,7,29 March 2015,"As a big fan of science fiction, I have read the Divergent installment, and INSURGENT is the best by far. Unsurprisingly I was thrilled to watch the movie - and guess what? - I liked it!First, Insurgent starts pretty much at the beginning of the movie with Tris and Four running to Amity - the kind faction to find a place to hide. But they find out the struggles of being in a faction that does not belong to them. Meanwhile, Jeanine is searching in all the factions the one special divergent that will be able to open the mystery box that Tris's parents were hiding from the society. As a result, Tris and Four find them selves on the one hand running from Jeannine and on the other hand preparing for war against Jeanine.Insurgent is packed with action,strong emotional and romance scenes and also lots of well done performances from all the actors ( especially Shailene Woodley's).In my opinion you should ignore all the reviews and go watch a very good movie that contains lots of drama,action,well done performances and romance.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent

The characters were constant in their roles. As with any futuristic drama, you have to suspend your belief and ignore a few plot holes but there was nothing silly or insulting to my intelligence. I knocked off 2 stars for the uninspired mood music and the rather quiet dialogue. I thought that it was slightly better than the previous movie as the factions weren't overly exaggerated but rather accepted and simply part of the story.
In my opinion, the low ratings are strange. There are not a lot of other movies today that I feel have a good story and are well presented and acted. And exciting!",The Divergent Series - Insurgent

The special effects, the action, the cast, everything is amazing but I missed more of the story line of the book. Half the things of the book never happened on the movie and the ones that did were almost completely change, it even has a complete different ending. We all know that movies are never going to be exactly like the book and you can understand some stuff has to be left out in order to fit it into two hours, but that doesn't mean change everything. I keep wondering how they're going to adapt Allegiant for it to make sense with this ending.. It's not a bad movie at all, I actually enjoy it and my friends who haven't read it found it to be great, but as a fan of the book I couldn't stop comparing and was kind of disappointed because I expected to be more truth to it...",The Divergent Series - Insurgent

194,dustyfairyza,Insurgent the movie,8,22 March 2015,"Insurgent uses the concepts of the books, but pretty much is just an interpretation. I loved it. I loved the action. I loved how the movie brought in the third books' story. After reading the books I was not happy. The story made no sense, the 3rd book had no connection with the first 2 books. I felt like the story should have ended after the second book. What the movie so brilliantly does is make the rest of the story relevant. It feels like there is more to tell at the end of the movie.Things I didn't like: Tris looking to boyish. not just the hair, (she was beautiful in Fault in our stars), but her whole demeanour, her body is to masculine. It was supposedly only a ""few days later"" from where Divergent ended. and she looked completely different. I hated that it was in 3D. Will watch it again in 2D. it wasn't done properly. Struggled to focus my eyes. very blurry sometimes.Things I loved: Four. And his whole story. The changes they made to the story. the Box.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
195,kefinka,"If you read the book, DO NOT come near this thing...",3,22 March 2015,"Upon seeing the trailer for Insurgent, I knew straight away the film will be different from the book and I was okay with it. If I had known just how much did they butcher the book, there would not have been a power on Earth strong enough to make me cough up the money for the ticket. I cannot even begin to list everything wrong with this movie but I will do my best to point out the highlights: The performances. There is a reason why I gave 3 stars. One is for Miles Teller. He is the only bright spot in the entire mess. He is witty, funny, quick and sharp. The other star is for Shailene Woodley. Her performance was nowhere near to what she is capable of but I think she did the best she could with the little she got. The rest of the cast was a nightmare. Theo James was so wooden he might just as well not be in the movie at all. Octavia Spencer did not get enough space to introduce herself properly, let alone show off her talent and whoever cast Naomi Watts must have been drunk out of his senses. She is a decent actress but she looked like Four's ex- wife, not his mother. Even Kate Winslet was repetitive and uninteresting. The writers made both Jeanine and Evelyn into one-dimensional clichés and took away anything interesting about them. The story. The person who wrote the script clearly holds no respect for the author's work or the fans. There are whole scenes that were not in the book and the scenes and dialogues crucial for both the plot and character development are not altered - they are missing altogether. You cannot even recognise Tris from the book. Her feeling of guilt is spoken of to the point where it bothers you because she becomes whiny and self-absorbed, yet she runs around firing a gun at anything that moves. She is presented as the typical ""chosen one"" you have seen a thousand times before and there is nothing original about her journey anymore. The only thing I have to applaud are the effects (the reason for the third star). They are truly stunning, even though the are deliberately paraded in the scenes that are made out of (extremely) thin air. The use of special effects is a tricky thing. If the story is great, you do not need a lot of them, just enough to create the environment and underline the story. However, if there is such a severe lack of originality in the screenplay as you can observe here, you notice the precise amount and nature of visual wonders and yet they do nothing to improve the overall impression which in this case is that I could have been doing literally anything else and it would not have been such a huge waste of time. I do not normally post reviews because they reflect my own opinion but in this case I felt obliged to save someone the pain of seeing their beloved book torn to pieces and prostituted for profit. Seriously, save yourself the pain. I cannot, so I am hoping for amnesia...",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
196,Seltheus,Falls a little short in comparison to Divergent.,5,8 April 2015,"For someone who hasn't read the books, I can only comment on what the movie itself portrays and what it actually is.As I personally thought Divergent, the first adaptation of the book series, was surprisingly entertaining and decently performed, I have to admit Insurgent was not really a disappointment (that would be too strong of a word) but a small letdown in general.Insurgent really felt like the middle of a book series, without having a real climax. It pushes forward the overall story arc, but doesn't work on it's own merits. There is too much emphasize on ""already knowing"" the characters and their motivations back from Divergent, than actually establishing them throughout Insurgent itself. So unless you still have an emotional attachment to the characters back from the first movie, it will be hard to really care about the characters here.The movie itself has no mayor flaws in it's screenplay. The biggest problem the movie has, is establishing enough context for the characters so they actually ""matter"" outside of that context. You don't really feel close to the characters, unlike in Divergent, or feel a real need for them to be there. They do a well enough job at delivering the story, but it just lacks genuine care. The characters are portrayed around their most basic personality established in the first movie, without giving them any more depth in this sequel.Aside from that the movie is generally entertaining, but lacks the emotional range and depth the first had.What really starts to become ""annoyingly"" obvious for regular movie watchers though are the continuity mistakes that are scattered all around the movie. While at first it's not a big deal, they start to pile up in such a short amount of time, that you can't ignore them anymore. Plus wasted screen time for things that really don't matter at all in the movie. These two things are what had the biggest impact on my rating in general.Overall it's a decent continuation of what Divergent started, but I really hoped it would be able to continue on the same level of quality as Divergent, which sadly it didn't.If you watched Divergent, give it a try and see if it is still interesting enough for you to go and see the final installment of the movie which is gonna be divided into two parts (since that's a trend) but if you already didn't like the first installment that much, chances are Insurgent will not convince you to watch any further. If you liked Divergent, give Insurgent a try and see for yourself.I personally will watch the movies to the end once they hit the theaters, but after Insurgent, my expectations are a little lower than what they were after Divergent.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
197,tinarox731,Trailer was confusing at first,10,27 April 2015,"When I read the book, I was really confused in the middle, but in the end it all made sense because there was a huge chuck the reader was missing out on and in the end, it's finally revealed. When I first saw the trailer, I was confused because hey added a box and I didn't know how it was going to be used; after all, there was no box in the book. After watching the movie, it became clear to me what the box is used for and I think it was a really smart idea that they used the box because without it, the movie would've been so long, as is the book, and it would've been too confusing. I like that they shortened the movie by adding something and changing the story up a bit. This movie was amazing. The stunts were incredible and the suspense was a killer. When I saw it, I wanted to see it four more times. I absolutely loved the movie. However, like the first movie, I didn't like that Tris doesn't call Four by his real name, Tobias, like she does in the book. But other than that, the storyline was well written and the movie was amazing.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
198,brin-t-murray,Insurgent: waiting for no. 3 working title Detergent,7,19 March 2015,"Well this is what I wrote last year re Divergent (it's actually a response to some more annoying banalities in the book):So yeah I'm rooting for Molly. What is the solution to her being soundly thrashed by tiny Tris and then cut altogether from the Dauntless programme? - the sequel, Molly's revenge. She comes back and force-feeds Tris growth hormone and liquidized mars bars until she's two hundred pounds. Or she turns the book into a much better movie, with a spectacular cityscape, which disappears some of the more irritating stupidities of the book. Such as, Tris is normal-sized not a micro- tiny 00 annoyingly trying to manipulate the reader/viewer into spurious sympathy. And the factionless really are down-and-outs not blue collar workers (still begs the question of who does all the grunt work to keep the city running, but at least blue collar is no longer defined as a drain on society.)And now we have Insurgent. I didn't read the book and neither will I: life is short and book one not good enough. I also have to say that I find the premise that some reviewers find intriguing - that of factions, with everybody being designated into a faction at the age of 18 according to their propensities - thoroughly ridiculous, unless the human genome has gone steeply downhill in 200 years and is producing simplistic versions of people, which doesn't seem to be the case, and would make for very dull viewing if it were. Also it's unoriginal - Aldous Huxley's Brave New World had a similar idea a very long time ago. But no harm recycling old ideas for new audiences. So why is it still well worth watching despite daft premise - and some pretty gigantic plot holes? Such as, Dauntless are the security guys - the police and army combined - and yet they are now on the run from Erudite - whose military strength comes from... where exactly??? Well we don't know. Only that they now have a lot of grunty trucks and mean-faced soldiers. By magic. This is why it's worth watching: fabulous cityscapes and a brilliantly-realized physical world. Despite the holes, a story that holds together more than well enough to suspend disbelief and maintain interest. Ongoing moderately violent, gripping, fast and furious action sequences. Great performances - especially from Shailene Woodley - the viewer does invest in the characters and Tris is real up there on screen. Though it's true you can't quite buy her tossing around these bullocky guys twice her size. Two things re ending - can't quite see where they're going to go now. The story could quite easily just finish here very satisfactorily. And... the new baddie woman (Four's Mum)? just looks way too pretty standard issue Hollywood. No evil, no force of personality, a shallow realization. Can't believe the Factionless wouldn't just have trampled her underfoot in passing and not even noticed.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent

I really like the actress and follow her in other movies. She's also from my hometown.But this sequel simply sucked. If I were the author, I'd be angry they butchered my story.It was obvious to me that they were squeezing the middle and last book together into some hurried mishmash of warped destruction of both. Make money quick, was the goal, I'm sure.Just so you know, this movie is nowhere near the original story in content or quality. The original storyline is really good and the third book explains everything, when the characters go outside the fence. I won't spoil it for you and say what they find. The trilogy ends tragically, unlike this dumb movie version. I guess they were trying to dumb down the plot for what the director perceives as a YA bubblegum audience.

I was immensely impressed with the film-making efforts and the scope of imagination in the world of ""Divergent"". It was only a few hours ago, that I confirmed that 2015 is going to be as good as last year, when I was exposed to yet another sublime addition to this new and compelling saga. ""Insurgent"" delivers just as much as its predecessor but with more emotion, gravity, and exuberant ambiance. The beginning and the ending combined make for a great flavoring of the substance. Shailene Woodley is a luminous bella donna of modern mainstream cinema and is unbeatable at what she has to offer.

This is not the best Sci-Fi movie I've ever seen, let's be honest, but it isn't that bad as well.This sequel makes sense to me as Tris and Four continue to rebel against evil Jeanine of Erudite which wants to avoid people leaving the circle Chicago is in. It's a whole journey to come to this point and yes, the action-scenes are not all well scripted, but it does make sense to me at least. I mean people complain about action scenes not being totally realistic in any sense, but do people forget what a movie is all about? Don't people have any imagination anymore? Just let the movie continue without paying literally attention to every single detail.The only thing that I constantly find weird (but I guess the character in the book does it) is that Peter constantly is like ""Hey, screw yourself"" and when he sees Tris and Four winning he is like ""Hey, I want to join you"" and this goes on and on continously...Don't get me wrong here.

This movie had good moments, but the movie was mostly a bore. The cinematography was okay, acting was good but wasn't enough to feel attached to the characters.

So, I can't say whether this was a good screen adaption or not. I do like good movies worth re-watching though, and this film does not leave me wanting more. There is a good amount of filler, and a semblance of some padding out, though it has a weak storyline and some sub-par acting moments. In true 'tween form, the movie wants to explain away any fluff straightaway. Thinking's hard, huh? Let's also strip it of any creativity or ingenuity by merging it with today's pop culture fads...that way it will seem fresh without requiring any measurable intelligence.

205,nejclozarslo,Is Insurgent an under-appreciated gem?,7,16 October 2016,"Before we get started, let me say that I haven't read a book. I just don't read. This is something that bothers me heavily when people are enraged and dislike a movie simply because it wasn't loyal to a book or when movie feels jumbled and confusing simply because you haven't read a book and when you complain about it people say you should read the book. Movie is a movie, book is a book.One of the most common complaints I heard about this film is that it has too convoluted plot. It most definitely has a complex plot but at no point did I feel lost. I would go as far and say that if you got lost in the plot you probably haven't paid proper attention or simply switched your brain off, because I was entertained and thrilled through out the entire run time.Insurgent is the kind of movie that greatly benefits from being a sequel. We already had our characters set up in a first movie (Divergent). With origin story out of the way we can just have our characters being badass right out the gate.Easily the most interesting character is of course Tris, played amazingly by Shailene Woodley. She is the heart and soul holding this movie together. And as I said we saw her became badass in Divergent, now we can just have her awesome immediately and she even steps it up further. One of my favorite scene in the movie is when she stands trail at Candor and is forced to speak the truth. Her performance in that scene is just... flawless. But not just her performance, but also the editing, timing of the shots, pausing, just an amazing and brilliantly crafted sequence. It's scenes like this that really make you connect with her character. Overall she absolutely sells it as this emotionally broken girl who feels that she has to make things right even after having lost everything already.With all that praise for Shailene Woodley, I must admit that the rest of the cast, with exception of Theo James and Milles Teller from time to time, does feels like they are a bit bored. The two big names (Kate Winslet and Naomi Watts) while good don't really do much.Another concept that I loved is the sim test to open that box. (For the spoiler sake that is all I will say.) I love how Tris feels like she needs to do it because she feels responsible. Not to mention that that scene contains some phenomenal action sequences. Also early on in a film there is some excellent and of course very subtle foreshadowing for one of the sims.It's just little gems like this, some truly well crafted and filmed action sequences (no shaky cam, thank god) and just an incredible performance from Shailene Woodley that honestly lead me to believe that this movie is much more then just a quick YA novel to film cash grab adaptation, especially since as I said I haven't read the book so I can just watch the movie for what it is.I honestly would go as far and say that is better then the original and definitely better then Allegiant which is what inspired me to rewatch the first two and review Insurgent.Ulitmatly Insurgent is not without it's fair share of flaws but overall this is one of the better young adult films we got so far.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
206,SusanMayWriter,Insurgent turned me around on the books,8,16 March 2015,"Veronica Roth, author of the Insurgent series, was one of the top-selling authors last year, with the Divergent series rarely out of the Amazon top ten. Of course, the films are going to do well on the back multi-million copy book sales. I wasn't a fan of the book series, having read them long before they became bestsellers. I found them a touch tedious and lacking pace, and I couldn't shake the feeling they were a copy of The Hunger Games. However, the films are an entirely other beast, in that they neatly condense the books, thus creating a far more exciting watch than a read (at least for me). Even though these films haven't been on my must-see list, the latest episode Divergent has changed all that for me. It's an exciting mix of action, romance, and politics, well put together by the writers, and even if you haven't seen the first movie or read the books, you will still enjoy this thrilling ride. The film opens throwing us right into the middle of the action, following on from Divergent. Tris (Shailene Woodley), Four (Theo James) and the gang are now outlaws and on the run from Jeanine (Kate Winslet), leader of Erudite faction. They are holed up at Amity faction, where the code is to remain peaceful and forgiving. It doesn't take long for the small Dauntlet group to find themselves at odds with the nature of the Amity villagers and to be discovered by Eric (Jai Courtney) and the guards hunting them down on behalf of Jeanine. Tris is, also, dealing with the guilt of the slaughter of her mother and her friends in the raid, which wiped out Tris's old faction, Abnegation. She discovers her mother was protecting a secret for which she was prepared to die; the same secret for which Jeanine will kill. A little more is revealed about Eric, which adds a twist to the story. Some old friends will betray Tris, but she will, also, find new allies. In Insurgent, the world is revealed as bigger than we imagined in Divergent, and you will be left panting for the next film. This series has turned me around on the book series, and I now see why it's done so well. These are interesting characters and the angst and fight in Tris makes her a great protagonist. In fact, I don't think I can wait for next year's film Alligient (which incidentally is being split into two parts) to discover what happens; I may have to read the book.

This time the stakes are set higher, the action pumps up a notch and Ansel Elgort wipes his grin and gets in the fight. Robert Schwnetke's previous, R.I.P.D was a disaster, to make up for his bad film, Insurgent's brilliant direction. Woodley is absolutely amazing, Elgort, James and Winslet are fantastic as well. This time, the whole plot is cheesy, and filled with bad twists and turns. Divergent was a mediocre, rushed but well acted adaptation, and Insurgent keeps more of the same genes.

I am super confused....I do like the actors and if I wouldn't have read it, I would probably think this movie was kick ass...DON'T go see it in 3D....its not worth it....the 3D is not great....so don't spend the extra money on it....overall I give this a 6 because I love the characters....I hope they do book 3 some justice...because it is actually the best of the series in my opinion....so we shall see...I will say Shailene looked AMAZING....I wanted to love this...but its just not the right story and not what I expected AT ALL!!!",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
209,smspencer69,sub Hunger Games wannabe meets The Matrix,3,20 March 2015,"So the basic premise behind the series is that based on their personality people are split in to different ""factions"" that are given names like Araldite, Candies and Gormless. Members of these factions are given roles within the society, I forget / don't know what each faction is or their role in society but basically a big portion of the population are hippies whilst one faction is really in to extreme sports like Free Running, Base Jumping, Absailing and no doubt they've got a rad skate park to hang out at but you don't get to see that in this film. All these factions are ruled over by a malevolent dictatorship headed up by Kate Winslet as Sarah Palin.Insurgent picks up where Divergent finished; whilst the Divergents have gone to live with the Ewoks the Imperial Stormtroopers killed a load of hippies and discovered a magic box that they were hiding. They want to use this magic box to kill all the Jedi's but the catch is only someone who's strong with the force can open the magic box. So Sarah Palin sends out Agent Smith and his cronies to check the general population for high levels of midichlorians or something and hunt down the rebel alliance.Low and behold the only person who can open the magic box is girl next door come messiah, Katniss erm I mean Tris, who promptly gives herself up to the evil Emperor Palin and is subsequently inserted in to The Matrix and forced to open the magic box. The promise of a dark Empire Strikes Back type storyline does not come to fruition instead we are subjected to a futuristic feature-length episode of The O.C. With a few twists that are so blatantly telegraphed they are more Kit Kat than Curly Wurly, Agent Smith and Sarah Palin are defeated and the evil empire is destroyed.Divergent was a poor-mans Hunger Games but whereas the latter has steadily got worse Insurgent has quickly declined, and Divergent wasn't that good in the first place. Not so much the middle film of a trilogy more a second film in a series where everything is wrapped up neatly but the door is very much left open for the next film which will no doubt be more of the same but bigger and badder. And ""badder"" in a bad way not a good way if you know what I mean. Save yourself £15; from the supermarket pick up a bag of popcorn or large bag of Doritos (if you sprinkle them with grated cheese and put them in a preheated oven for a minute or two they taste just like the ones from the cinema), go home and watch Hunger Games on DVD in the comfort of your own home.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent

The acting is pretty bad, from those actors you sort of recognise, but you don't remember the name (except for Kate Winslet who must have needed a new handbag!) It is set in an apocalyptic world, no doubt trying to cash in on the Hunger Games movies. The lead is a poor mans Jennifer Laurence, and I never really believed any emotion she was attempting to portray. The storyline is pretty weak, you can see what is coming at most points. There is the standard guy pretending to be bad, and then comes good. They survive the most ridiculous of events, including the Hollywood last second saves.

213,vladimirstankovic94,A slight improvement over Divergent,7,6 January 2017,"Yes, this trilogy is definitely not worth investing any of your time in it. That is the fact. However, my seven stars go for the slight improvements in the plot, visual effects and action. Yes, this trilogy started as one of the biggest failure in imitating The Hunger Games, but I think they started to ""diverge"" starting from the middle part of the second sequel. The story started to be much more original and that's why I will give other sequels a chance as well. Nonetheless, one cannot escape the feeling that the whole plot is a bit shallow, there are many scenes when you are just wondering what the hell is this or how did this even happen? Obviously, someone could have done a better job in transferring the book into the movie, unless the book itself is shallow. Remains to be seen.Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this movie. The only ones who are completely going to enjoy this trilogy are teenage girls, while they drool over the perfect male super-masculine protagonist. As for the teenage boys, sorry lads, the female protagonist is not hot (at all).",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
214,daemonyx,Disappointed,5,13 July 2015,"With Divergent, I found the story to be intriguing, but what really drew me into the movie was the characters. I love a good underdog overcoming the odds kinda movie, and that was a prevalent component with Tris. Choosing her faction, climbing the ratings ladder, learning about her own strengths (and weaknesses), while we learned how determined, fearless, and unique she was in a variety of situations. The other characters around her also drew me in... Four, Christine, her mother, even Jeannine in wondering how far she would go.I didn't see a lot of those things in Insurgent, which left me feeling deflated to say the least. To me she looked and acted weak, she seemed afraid, and withdrawn. She would act tough one minute (a little too tough in most cases), and in the next be a whimpering submissive following Four's lead. The whole time I kept waiting for those ""YES!"" moments that there were in the first movie, and the few (I'm being generous) that were there paled greatly in comparison to Divergent.This SHOULD have been a MUCH better movie with the potential laid out from the first one, and in my opinion, it just simply wasn't realized.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent

The book is a completely separate work and if the producer of a movie wants to change the story it doesent mean the movie will automatically be bad. Simple.This whole series is great.

You are not pleased what you just encountered here dear audience? I felt strongly sharing the seat with these so called divergents since the 1st movie but when I saw what kind of ratings this movie had received I almost skipped this one completely. In the end I am glad that I didn't do that because it was good! Best movie I've watched this summer and the ending is just genius, isn't it overheated, mad IMDb reviewers? ;) I bet you who reviewed this 1-3/10 felt that those divergents were the losers what you bullied in the schools and you felt more like that you belong to the factions there were? I really can't imagine any other explanation why you guys can go that crazy with your reviews what comes to this movie.This movie series isn't about copying Hunger Games like most of you like to say here when you diss this movie, of course they got some things in common since they are based to Sci-Fi books for youngsters but seriously, this was much better than the last Hunger Games - at least in my opinion.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent

However this one wasn't enjoyable, unless you're watching it with the purpose of making fun of every single scene, because in that case, it's an okay movie. I've read the books and this film is almost unrecognizable. Although the characters (most of them) are the same, the storyline is very different.

And no one saw Peter entering the control room...Everyone's behavior is predictable. Christina, Peter, Caleb... Basically you can tell what they'll do next.Finally, what's wrong with all these novels and movies?

Previously, I had complained about her acting in the first film, which I had found to be somewhat one dimensional. In hindsight, I believe it to be very well played and Insurgent shows the full range of the actress' ability.I also loved the music in the film. I might have used rock music myself but I'd have been wrong. This was better. It fit the script and the plot.Now I'm looking forward to watching Allegiant tomorrow.Thank you all for producing such a lovely piece of film.

In fact, I have found it more real content, if one doesn't count some inconsistencies for too much. Behind all strong CGI effects protrudes more depth than it appears at first sight. The acting is strong too, especially by the 2 protagonists. Although no one would sincerely believe that Tris (Sheilene Woodley) has as much physical strength as she displays here, her screen presence is intense and charismatic. Her friend and partner, Four (Theo James) does a good job too, he seems to have grown as an actor. The film is said to address a public of adolescents and young adults.

This movie however, made three extremely important and loved characters from the book super minor in the movie (heard from my friends). Also, another thing I personally did not like was the amount of killing and unnecessary violent shots in the film, of course they're fake but there were just too many graphically violent scenes that they could of toned down a bit.

228,grace-doody,Insurgent is the follow on from the film Divergent based on the books by Veronica Roth.,7,19 March 2015,"Insurgent is the follow on from the film Divergent based on the books by Veronica Roth. I was lucky enough to go to a pre screening of this film in 3D IMAX, the graphics are beyond unreal and the story line is pretty good too. They always say that the book is better than the film, but it feels like the book and the film are 2 completely different stories. As a fan of the books I have always stood by them, however I loved this idea of 'The Box'.The basis of the film is that Jeanine (Kate Winslet) is trying to find all the Divergent to try to open a box that is believed to contain a message from the founders of the faction system. While she's doing that our main characters Tris (Shailene Woodley) and Four (Theo James) are on the run from the whole system, staying in the other factions trying to keep safe. In the book Tris is still on the run but she stays in the other factions much longer and develops other relationships with other characters. in the book there is also no mention of 'the box' but in an interview, Veronica Roth stated that the idea of 'the box' combines most of her favourite scenes within the book.Don't get me wrong I really did like the film, I think it is amazing and I love the whole story but, I just came out of it feeling confused because I had already read the books and they are nothing alike. I now know what it means now when it says based because it has only got the underline of the book.

229,summerreighn,Disappointed,4,11 August 2015,"I will start by saying I read all the books, and it really bothers me when movies adapted from books, completely through out the source material. That is exactly what happens with Insurgent, and I'm not just talking about cutting scenes for obvious time restraints. The main plot progression in the book is about Jeanine (Winslet) trying to keep the outside world a secret from the society inside the wall. Why flip a main plot point for NO apparent reason?? Most of the other changes involved characters from the book, like Johanna. She is so one dimensional in the movie you almost forgot she is even there, a waste of casting a great actress like octavia Spencer. Aside from all the other changes from the book this was not a good movie it was OK at best. The plot has no real substance or storyline, the whole thing seems like a rushed chase scene with no beginning middle or end. I tried to except the fact that we obviously weren't going to see any new exciting characters and hoped maybe to see some character development from the originals of divergent..Another disappointment. Shailene Woodley as Tris is hard to take seriously as the action hero. While Theo James (Four) doesn't have much more to offer than a scowl, and I've always personally thought him to be too old for the role which makes his ""love scenes"" with Trish seem awkward. The movie wasn't all bad if you hadn't read the books and didn't go in with to have hopes and he just wanted to see some good action scenes you wouldn't be completely disappointed. To me though the whole movie seems like a flash of pretty faces and pretty places and I probably would've thought the same if I would've watched it with the sound off as the dialogue did nothing to progress the story or help you understand anything that was going on. When I finally got to the end it didn't surprise me that they change so drastically from the book, it had a ""all is well the end"" feel. They it in the series right here and I wouldn't care what happens to these characters or the world. I can only help for the next two films they get a different director and definitely a different screenwriter",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
230,katieca-14685,"Better than Divergent, only slightly",3,12 August 2021,"The second film in the trilogy focuses on a mysterious box uncovered in the Prior house. How Jeanine knew about it, we are never told (that I'm aware of).Tris is suffering from PTSD after the events of the first movie, so the way her character is portrayed finally feels right. She's depressed and has a lot on her mind. She's on the run from Jeanine who has blamed her for the Dauntless attack on Abnegation and is hunting down all the Divergents.The technology in this movie remains surreal. A machine that scans your face and tells you what percentage Divergent you are? Really? Those black hose pipes that Jeanine is using for her human experiments don't seem to get tangled at all during simulations... unless they are painfully rotating at the injection site within the test subject each time they do a flip or something (you'll see what I mean). In addition, those tiny mind control/simulation bullets that work no matter where in the body they are lodged... it's too much of a stretch for a scientific mind to accept.As with the previous movie, they tell us facts about the characters, but they don't delve deep enough to inspire us to care about them. For example, they subtly hint at a history between Jeanine and Evelyn, but there's no real tension there. Evelyn's whole past is just thrown at us in bullet point fashion and although the actress tries her best to emote, I don't feel her struggle. She looks well enough for being Factionless (most of them do); she can even afford her own makeup, hair dye, and blow-dryer so...The visuals are quite good, I must admit, especially during Tris' Dauntless simulation when she tried to save her mother from the burning house. Four's combat skills are fun to watch in action and more believable than others.The ending is very predictable right from the opening of Divergent when they first mention the wall and both movies could have (and should have, in my opinion) been easily combined to make a much more compelling, quick-paced and possibly nerve-wracking story.Overall, it's not a movie I would recommend unless you just want something playing in the background while you do some chores, or craft, or light reading.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
231,strysickchloe,Why this movie is bad and continuously receives terrible ratings,1,26 July 2019,"Although the Divergent series is old I have just started reading the books and am now on the third, Allegiant. After I completed the first book I was ecstatic to see how the ingenious book would be converted to a movie expecting the same transformation that the Hunger Games series made, which was wonderful. But i was sadly mistaken.The first movie, Divergent, was very humorous to me and I spent most scenes laughing at the conversion of the characters, plot, and even some settings. I tried to over look it though keeping at least a sliver of hope that insurgent might be better because of the change in directors. So I read Insurgent, the story carried its brilliance and raised my hope to assurance that even if the casting will be the same, there is no way that the director can let down this amazing story, but again mistaken. The movie ruins the reputation that the books received and i am astounded that Veronica Roth herself would let this movie into the public. First off, the plot is lost in every scene making this dystopian world sound war riddled instead of secretive and hidden. Also, the acting is such a let down considering the numerous famous actors and actresses casted, the main characters seem confused instead of strong because of the weak acting that Woodley and James withheld throughout the movie. Lastly, even large events in the book were overlooked because of the time the director wasted to put unimportant factors that are not even relevant to the story!Do not watch this movie and the others of this series, save yourself the time and dignity. I do suggest reading the books though because as I suggested they are brilliant and truly inspiring pieces of art, which is why I am writing this review. If I could sum this movie into one word it would be, disappointment. This movie is a disappointment. The acting is a disappointment. The time I took to watch this movie disappoints me.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
232,ricalderonavion,"Just... wow, this is repulsing",2,7 February 2021,"Insurgent.There are many many many instances of plot convenience littered all the way throughout this movie, like the ""truth serum"" sequence, which I think was just used as an uncreative plot device to get her to confess, I can think of several better ways they could've done this off the top of my head. The plot convenience alone, affects the horrible pacing the most. Literally 30 minutes in, the setting had changed way too many times, and way too abruptly as well. On top of a this, a lot of things go unexplained, most the time it's just because the movie just assumes you remember every tiny detail from the first movie, and ceases to provide any backstory or flashback, even when there is a clear opportunity for a well placed flashback sequence, like at the beginning.
Also, most of the main characters in this film, tend to be not very memorable or likeable. like Theo James's character, Tobias, he can just kill people, with feeling very little remorse. And Miles Teller's character, Peter, literally went from slight antagonist, to an actual villain, with little explanation. Later he... suddenly, wasn't the villain anymore?? Idk. The main villain, ""Jeanine"" is really lacking in character depth, she's just power hungry, like, there was one time where she said ""I am doing this for the greater good"" which I think was a pretty good line actually, it shows the moral dilemmas she has to face. OH WAIT! the ""greater good"" is just her wanting to control everything, so nevermind. Towards the ends of the movie, Tris ""dies"" whenever Jeanine tries to use her divergent crap or whatever, to open some box? And it would've been completely fine if they ended the movie there, and of course changed some things up here and there in the previous parts of the narrative, and somehow explained what was in the box, but no, they had to drag it out even longer because they realized the pacing sucks and it happened way to fast.

More often than not I'm disappointed with the movie, usually it's a promising good idea but wasted, a lot of CGI and not much depth. I suffered through Hunger Games but survived, it was not as bad as it could be, and then the Divergent arrived.The first one was not especially good but it was sort of watchable and mildly interesting, introducing all these factions and the (implausible) way the worlds is run. It just would not function that way but it's a movie . But the second one, Insurgent, deteriorated enormously. The villains are getting more and more evil and one-dimensional, turning into caricatures, long dead mother suddenly showing up, teen romance getting very cheesy (and additionally a 30 years old guy playing a teenager, regardless of his youthfulness and good looks, is just ridiculous). All the novelty of the first one is long gone and we are left with the dull story, lack of tension and underdeveloped stereotypical characters.I wouldn't recommend this movie, you will miss nothing by not watching it.

239,kentavarvd_hp,Total Confusion !,3,20 March 2015,"SPOILERS are added in my short review !!!!!! Well ... it's hard to describe what I watched about an hour ago . I've read the books , of course they are not something special or brilliant but they can perfectly take place in the list of enjoyable ones . I was shocked how much the director has changed the plot of the books and the way that the main characters should be presented in this movie . One word ""DISSAPOINTMENT "" !!!!Somehow I lost the connection with the whole atmosphere in the middle of the movie . It felt like it is a different story that was missing something.Don't know why but the performance of Shailene didn't work for me this time . Her pretty face just ruined everything that I imagined as a strong and tough character in Insurgent .... A lot of the key moments in the book were gone and for the readers especially it was not that much of a satisfaction .The second part of the movie was a total disaster .... I can't believe how the writer agreed for such a dramatic change in the plot.While sitting and watching the movie I was so inpatient to see the final battle , the emotional conclusion , the way Jeanine should have died but the thrill suddenly disappeared after a few scenes .... What was that with the box ? Some kind of joke or what ? I can't imagine what is gonna be the next movie Allegiant and I'm not sure if I'm gonna watch it but probably it will be something far away from the real story . The only pros of Insurgent were the great cinematography and visual effects supported with not that bad soundtrack ! : )",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
240,joshua-curzon,Poor plot and some equally bad acting,3,14 June 2016,"The biggest problem with this movie is the way the characters are written, playing to stereotypes and thus making it cringe inducing at times to see the same tired ideas trotted out. The plot of one girl versus a large oppressive regime is tired, overused, and to be quite honest in this case simply unbelievable, as Beatrice is such an incomplete character, swerving from one mental breakdown to another. The clichés of a mysterious and quiet male lead and the emotionally unstable female lead, not to mention the evil middle aged woman, simply don't cut it. I suppose you are meant to root for Beatrice, but she's far too poorly written and performed for that to happen. Instead, her endless self-pitying grows tiresome and ultimately you just cannot wait for the film to be over. Another major gripe is that in my mind at least, what the directors have managed to achieve is an utterly dull, drab, and grey dystopian future. With the imagined CGI budget quite large it is disappointing to see so little effort put into creating a jaw dropping environment to draw some focus away from the bad acting.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
241,fabio-1997,I love it!,7,31 May 2015,"although it's not quite like the book, insurgent is just an amazing ride, with really good special effects and very good acting, especially from woodley, who is outstanding! the story itself, differs from the books and it is a bit convoluted, divergent is a bit better in that way. Just know what you're in for, a fun action ride. Theo James was surprisingly good, he gave a deep performance. Some of the main cast acted like they didn't wanted to be there, Ansel for example. miles teller was so funny and good, i really really liked peter a lot more in this movie. so, watch it, it's good, but not perfect,as i said before, the story could be better, it is different from the books, a lot, but actually, it didn't bothered me. the final sequence in the film was mind-blowing! i just loved it...",The Divergent Series - Insurgent

Maybe then the movie will be easier to understand?I also found myself wondering where they got their change of clothes from, and various other anomalies in the film.Overall, the film seemed to lack good storytelling.Having said that, the effects are good, but the plot is a little flimsy.

It looks to me that some PR-agencies undermining the credibility of IMDb. I cannot take the IMDb rating serious any longer. This is a bad way to promote movies and IMDb should not be part of this.The plot is rather stupid. It reminded me of some cheap Indian gangster movies where a beautiful lady is kidnapped by some wild looking culprits and when it looks that the desperate lady will be raped and murdered, suddenly a hero jumps out behind a bush that weren't even there a minute before. I love well written sf-movies. This b-movie isn't one of it. One of the worst movies this year. I regret the time I wasted watching it.

244,paintballisbasic,Genuinely Terrible,1,21 March 2015,"I will preface this by saying that I have not read the books. I did see the first movie and actually enjoyed it. I usually watch movies such as this with a skeptic mind and the first one wasn't bad. This movie, however, was terrible. (Heavy spoilers roasting over an open fire to follow)I've heard that the movie deviates almost unforgivably from the book. If that's the case, I can't speak for the book but the movie script looks to have been written by a high-schooler, at best. The movie is riddled with clichés: Main character with a dark inner battle raging due to prior decisions made (boring!). People (and armies) showing up just at the perfect time (forgivable once, not around the 5th time). Bad guys who couldn't hit a target 20 feet in front of them while shooting an automatic weapon (man those guys suck). And the ultimate ""faked death with poison/paralysis"" scene (wow that whole scene was bad). Throughout the whole movie the main character (the annoying tom-boy girl), Tris, keeps being painted as ""tough"" and ""deadly"". She is neither of these. In fact, she is quite laughably the opposite. Could her personal trainers not put her through some weight-training classes? (Her hairstylist was definitely present as her hair looked like she just stepped out of a Hollywood salon right after the scene where she cut her OWN hair with a pair of rusty scissors....) It looks like she couldn't even do 10 push ups yet she was fighting people and saving people falling over ledges with ease. But she looks like a huge wuss! Her little girly grunts and squeals she made when fighting or doing ""action"" made me bust out laughing. And the scene where she breaks through the glass is meant to be bad-ass and instead just left me hoping she would bounce off the glass and fall flat on her back (man, I wanted to laugh so bad). And probably the most unforgivable part of this whole movie was how POINTLESS everything was. Examples: They fight the faction-less on the train, killing several and doing serious damage to many more (not really sure how because Tris fights like a sissy girl). Then the main character, Four, says his own name and the leader of the vagabonds through bloodied teeth is like, ""Oh we cool bro. Never mind you just head-butted me in the face and killed my friends."" (the Hell??) (Oh and Tris's brother is a huge pussy). They continue to fight hard and kill people to narrowly escape the perfectly- uniformed drone guards of the ""capital"" so that they can go in to hiding. Then the main character just gives herself up. I think it was because the villain was threatening to kill innocent people with her mind control devices (never seen that before), but it doesn't really matter. Then she's given the chance to escape by her double- double crossing 'friend' (didn't see that coming) and yet she chooses to stay to open the mystery divergent box. Well what was the point of anything if you wanted to open it anyway??! I was DYING to contain my frustration. (also, how does the evil capital lady have this perfectly built divergent-box-opening proprietary chamber system, complete with bulletproof glass and mystery-box holding pedestal, just already set up? Does no one question this stuff???)And to top it all off, the super-secret, must-be-preserved-at-all- costs message in the box, (the ENTIRE point of the movie): ""Divergents are cool, don't ostracize them. Oh, and the rest of humanity is living outside the wall. Cheers."" What? No one has bothered to check this whole time?????? Gag.Enough roasting. To conclude, lots of movies, even good ones, have clichés and information that you are just supposed to assume. But this movie was genuinely terrible. Maybe all the people reviewing this with an 7/10+ saw a different movie than I did.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
245,jessie-lou-68-444647,This Movie Really Surprised Me...,9,22 March 2015,"Let me start off by saying that I am a huge fan of the Divergent series. I adore all of the books, and was extremely impressed by the adaptation of Divergent. Insurgent was my favorite of the three books, so I absolutely couldn't wait to see this movie! And let me say that it surprised me in so many ways, that I honestly didn't know what to think at first. My immediate thought after the credits started rolling was I want to see it again! But, the more I thought about it (and watched it again), I realized that this movie was better than I was expecting it to be. I was really worried after all the trailers seemed to hint at the fact that they had really taken creative license. And they did. The movie Insurgent is drastically different from the book. If you are one of those people that can't stand it when a book to movie adaptation deviates from the source material, you will probably hate this movie. I could literally write a page or two long list of the things that were different. I won't go into specifics to avoid spoilers, but some of the key themes of the novel were changed or barely glossed over. Why did I like it so much then? I am pretty sure it was that I went into this expecting for it to be different, and accepting it. Veronica Roth's novel is just too long and complex to do it justice in a two hour time slot. I feel like the changes that were made were mostly pretty reasonable. The main thing that saved it for me: Shailene Woodley and Theo James. Their chemistry is completely off the charts. They are exactly what I picture when I think of Tris and Four. Ms. Woodley is a lovely actress, and her portrayal of Tris was pretty much on point. She captured the essence of the Tris I read in Insurgent. And Theo James was perfect too. He kept his strength, but at the same time he softened because of his love for Tris. The rest of the cast: stellar too. Naomi Watts should have been included in more scenes, because she captured the character of Evelyn perfectly for me. And the set for the faction less: mind-blowing (as is the Amity set). Miles Teller, Kate Winslet, Octavia Spencer, and Ansel Elgort brought light to characters as best as they could in their restricted time frame.Now the film wasn't perfect. There was so much I missed from the novel (mainly specific scenes and characters). Several characters that were cast in the movie (and led to much rejoicing in the Divergent fandom) were only there a couple seconds and would have been very easy to miss. But despite the changes, I felt like the movie worked overall. There is so much more I could go into about it, but I need to wrap it up. Bottom line: this was different from what I was expecting (in both good and bad ways), but it was still amazing. Despite all of the hate that this movie is getting, it's still worth viewing. It keeps the general essence of the series that I love so much. My one piece of advice: go in with an open mind. It might surprise you.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent

My wife watched the whole thing and she said it was crap.. The first one was OK but this was so boring. Yawn. I think the main character look awful with short hair. Her attitude and personality during the movie makes her unlikable. The so called tough guys are a bunch of pretty boys with 10 pubes between them.

247,sam-levesque,Underwhelming,5,25 July 2015,"For Young Adult Fiction, I really liked the first movie. It's probably my favorite of its genre (though that does not say much). So I am not speaking out of disdain.But I have to say this movie was underwhelming for so many reasons. It was bad for many others, but I feel like I could have forgotten some of its faults if only it didn't feel so flat, bland and boring. After all, lots of big movies can still be enjoyable even if they aren't that great. But this movie suffered from a total absence of style. It felt like it had no identity, no traction, no momentum, nothing, really, to offer the watcher.It clearly lacked substance, what's with the poor dialogues and the transparent plot. Nothing came close to remind us the few interesting themes barely explored in the first movie (friendship, love and family against social roles, divergence and conformity). So yeah, this movie really was a no-brainer. But as I've already said, I could have overlooked that. I couldn't overlook, however, how every single scene was boring, every dialogue fell flat and every action sequence seemed so passive. And the actors are not to blame on this. They seemed like they did the best they could. 1) But the dialogue is about as insignificant as can be, merely serving to hold the story together. Not memorable at all. It only felt instrumental, explaining to us verbally what is happening and why.2) The CGI is poorly done and overly used (and feels in fact to be superfluous most time). This is a deadly combination for sure.3) The music was weak. So weak. I believe music often turns out to be important to give tone to a movie. Well, the music here was not fitting for the scenes most of the time. And when it was, it was timid and insufficient.4) Incredibly dull, spiritless and unexciting action scenes. Honestly, I don't remember a time I have seen such monotonous action sequences. Something just seems so passive to 95% of the action. Most of it feels soft and safe, not dangerous at all (though the obvious plot, the CGI, the poor music and the insufficient camera work do not help). Also, some scenes were really just ""bullets-can't-touch-me-so-I-don't-care- yo"".Anyway, this movie was bad for many reasons. But really, it was underwhelming. And so, incredibly boring.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
248,nevelpalmer,Amazing acting with a solid story line and modern age effects,10,25 February 2016,"Insurgent is the second in the series, and I personally enjoyed it just as much. I have read many reviews, depicting the film as very bad and a copy, but really it's the opposite. Shailene Woodley and Theo James are such incredible actors, with real life chemistry that is reflected on the screen- they are the only stable thing in this dystopian world, where every part of society is starting to slide down the corrupted scale. I understand that many people reviewing this as bad don't see the true story behind it- Tris is such a complex, damaged yet strong character, expressing gender equality as this world sees no difference between men and women. Tris is also such a selfless person, yet she holds back her internal worth for others' lives. In Insurgent we see a deeper side to Four, we see his emotion vulnerability as well as his extremely strong external attire. Four, as well as Tris, is damaged on the inside, and Theo James portrays this excellent, as it seem his acting career has no boundaries- he really needs more credit for his skills. Shailene Woodley also deserves more credit- she sees this character, and not only executes another human with such strength, elegance and beauty, but she incorporates many of her own personal views into this character- this makes Tris such an amazing character .

Then read all the books and thought Neil Burger did a great job turning the first book into an accurate and entertaining film. I was so sad to know he was not directing Insurgent. And after seeing Insurgent, that sadness was justified.Robert Schawkle or whatever his name is did an awful job making the 2nd book into a movie. The 2nd book was lamer than the first, but it had a much easier plot to deal with. This movie strayed so far from the story in the book, title should be Insurgent Undone.They even had a bigger budget for this film, yet made it shorter in length, cramming scenes in with minimal creativity and almost zero character development. Almost everything that occurs is not true to the narrative in the book. Johanna appears to have no scars on her face and she's fat, wtf. The entire villain of Jeanine is tarnished by a completely different take on her motives. Book readers of this story should not watch the film nor appreciate its utter suckiness.

But lets get to the part with the movie.The major things that bothered me most were: (major spoilers included)First the ""ancient box message crap"" which just changes the plot so much that it is impossible to describe and even to try stick to it afterwards.With all the ""divergent has to open it"" and the percentage of divergence bullshit.Which is completely absent from the books and it is the kind ""touch"" which almost every movie nowadays has.That the main character is somewhat unique and the chosen one.In the book quite the contrary is implied.Second the character of Peter is so messed up,that his actions doesn't even make sense.In the book he decides to save them,because he believes he is in debt of Tris,because she saved his life in Amity.And he can't bear the thought to remain in debt to a Stiff.The whole union of dauntless and factionless and their ""appearance"" instead of an attack on Erudite headquarters are also so not in place and vaguely described that the main point of the factionless backstabbing the others and being the next usurpers is just missing from the plot,but whatever the whole movie is messed up anyway.Honestly I wasn't bored and still found it interesting to watch the movie,because the first one wasn't bad and I wanted to see what is changed here that unleashes such bad reviews and ratings ,but the ending of this movie was a huge bitch-slap in the face. And seeing who the director of the next movie is I guess it is game over for the series.This Robert Schwentke guy should have just kept doing the nonsense action packed potential-less movies he has been doing instead of ruining a series which actually do have potential to be good.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent

254,makstracy,More of a film trying to work up to the next one,7,7 September 2015,"I've read all the books in the Divergent series and honestly, Insurgent wasn't my favourite. I liked it substantially more than Allegiant, but not nearly as much as Divergent.With that said, I honestly liked this film more than the first, but that's probably because it was much more visually appealing. I liked the way the film was directed when it came to just looking at the scenes with the volume down, and I liked the cinematography, but I honestly didn't like how the story was told and how much they wasted opportunities to develop the characters.My biggest issue is with Four/Tobias. The first movie was how long? 2 and a half hours? This movie I'm guessing was roughly the same. We've had five whole hours of film and I still BARELY know the character. He's just a really good-looking guy who says everything like he's in a perpetual bad mood. I wanted to see them work with his character, and try to make something of it. In this movie, that just didn't happen.My next problem was mainly with the plot. I barely understood the plot in the book - that's probably just because I don't really remember it - but I understood enough of it to know that it was changed in the movie, and honestly I preferred it. It wasn't a strong plot and at times I was thinking 'what the hell is happening? Why is it only Tris who can do this? What is with all this 'chosen one' kind of stuff?', but it was mildly entertaining to watch, and very easy on the eyes with all the special effects that at times didn't really make much sense.With that said, I was applauding Shailene's performance for almost single-handedly carrying the entire movie. I feel that if she had been given more to work with, she would have made this a wonderful movie with the kind of performance she's capable of. I also liked Miles Teller's acting - I found it amidst the movie's aim to make itself sensible and serious rather refreshing.I don't regret watching the movie, and I'll probably watch the Part one and Part two of the last book because I feel that I need to watch the movie if I've read the book. I have no idea how they'll manage to salvage anything movie-worthy from Allegiant though, but I'll endure it. -",The Divergent Series - Insurgent

I fell in love with Tris as she struggle through her teenage life and finally grow from a quiet girl in the background to the strong, brave Divergent we all adore.

256,sky_magician,What. Why.,5,15 December 2015,"A 5 is being nice, here. My issue is with the direction this movie went.I read the books. They were obviously written for an audience slightly younger than I, but it was still intriguing enough to keep me going until the final book in the trilogy, and though the movie disappointed, it won't deter me from the extra book.Let's get onto the review.I understand condensing stories for movies. I understand reasonable changes that weren't so easy to translate onto film, or help the flow. There is an extent I can deal with in adaptations.Though somewhat detached from itself, and a lot of what made these characters was washed out, I still found it entertaining and tried to keep an open mind, until...--SPOILER------------The plot. Yes, the big directional change that really, really, really bummed me out.Ready? It was...The Box.That's right, /entire/ events that happens in the book was replaced by none other than the big Box. A big, cheap, convenient plot device that yes, allowed for some of the vivid simulations, but...I couldn't finish. This was not Veronica Roth's story. Divergent gave me hope as the movie was rather well done (though also detached,) then the sequel slowly crashed down. Great job, Summit.The whole Box thing ended for me with Michael Bay. I question why it's brought back here of all places. Who approved this idea, and what inspired it?I'm not normally anal about these things. Here, this was a slap in the face. Wouldn't be surprised if that's why the characters didn't seem all there, outside feeling like the screenplay made it really difficult for the actors in the first place. It was probably rushed for the 'look at this cool thing!'I'll just dive and say read the books. Insurgent the film diverts where it shouldn't. Can we get this remade?Side note, all this series and Hunger Games have in common is the dystopia. They're both their own takes in the genre.

257,wildroedeer,Another example of a terrible teen drama.,2,22 May 2016,"This is the sequel to the box office hit, teen dystopian drama The Hunger Gam- I mean Divergent and I've got to say, it was just as good as its predecessor...and by that I mean it was terrible. Take any dystopian future setting, insert a spoonful of stereotypical 'the-people- versus-the-system' story, add a ladle's worth of romance sub-plot between uninteresting characters with zero chemistry or similarities (add a little love-triangle drama in there too if you're feeling REALLY unoriginal, but in this case let's be lazier than usual and stick with two), a sprinkle of guy-being-a-dickhead-for-no-reason here, a teaspoon of innocent-character-turned-badass there, bake in boring post- production soundtrack for a few months and BOOM! out pops your freshly, fully-risen Insurgent. Oops, sorry, you forgot to add any artistic integrity and now it tastes like the rotting carcasses of the main (strong, female) character's inevitable dead parents, sorry!

In the film's defence, the camera-work was done fairly professional with some lovely shots in some instances (but is mostly just dull shot-reverse-shot), and Ansel Elgort does a decent job at his role, considering the shoddy material he is forced to work with, in comparison to the other actors in this film, but that is literally all I can say in terms of areas that it shines in. Everything else in this film was either substandard and dull or just plain bad. There was no effort to make this film something more than a studio product and certainly no intention of making it good, by any means. The editing was shockingly amateur, none of the characters were anything more than physical representations of edgy teens in the eyes of a studio executive.

260,Tof1988,A decent sequel to Divergent - but lacks something,8,22 March 2015,"At first, let me make it clear that I really liked the first movie, Divergent. I had not been familiar with the books or the story so it was an amazing ""utopia"" for me. In Insurgent, basically we get what we should expect from such a sequel: another two hours of 3D visual awesomeness and captivating storytelling, along with a lovable female main character played very well again by Shailene Woodley. And, of course, a well written screenplay with moral thoughts in the right moments.While watching, I could not help being deeply moved emotionally by the film. Like in Divergent, there are a lot of dreaming scenes and now they are extremely intense. All the time I was like really feeling everything what Tris felt, understanding her emotions perfectly, getting a little of her mental struggles. This part is well elaborated in the film. It makes you think that yes, this is the same with me. Yeah, I do have these same doubts when I have to make serious decisions in my own life. We are tested by life from time to time and it is not always an easy choice which way to follow: that of abnegation, amity, candor, dauntlessness, or erudition. This time, we get a deeper insight in the life and mental constitution of all the factions.However, I must say I was not fully satisfied with the film. Apart from Tris, other characters are too one-sided, predictable and not well elaborated. The only interesting character among the others is Jeanine's (Kate Winslet), but I think her motives, her way of thinking should have been presented more detailed. After the first film, it was a big question for me what her story is, her character had so much potential, but I think the writers did not make use of it at all. Luckily, Kate Winslet is an amazing actress who is always able to give a remarkable performance. One day, maybe, Shailene will become a fine actress too, I will wait for that. It will be a lot of work for her, but she is a bright talent. Aww, but it is a pity that they cut her beautiful hair short for the movie!All in all, Insurgent is a must-see if you liked Divergent and a good follow-up to it, but only gives you what you ""should"" expect instead of what you really expect.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent

It has an amazing plot, amazing characters, and a lot of twists and turns. The movie Divergent was ok. But Insurgent was very very bad.SPOILERS!The whole movie was pretty ok until the end. it missed a lot of important details. Peter, Tris, and Tobias leave the Erudite compound and go to abnegation where the factionless and dauntless are staying. The factionless explain the plan and the dauntless agree, except for Tris and Christina. They know it's not right. So, they team up with Marcus to save the information when the factionless want to destroy it. They sneak into Amity where Johanna recognizes them and ask what they're doing. They need to speak to the Erudite she is hiding there so they do and find Cara (Will's older sister) and Fernando and a couple others. They make a plan and sneak into erudite, Fernando makes up the word Insurgent and hen he dies. None of that happens. Tori never stabs Jeanine, you never see Lynn die, nor is she or Marlene even introduced. Then the factionless reveal that they want to kill everyone apart of the dauntless faction because they are a threat to society. But Tobias releases the information and Amanda Ritter is inteoduced. She explains important details and then, at the very end, she says that she is taking up a disguise and changing her name to fit in. Her new name is Edith Prior.None of anything I just said happened in the movie. The plot is compeletely different, and the book is SO much better. I understand that sometimes movies change things around and make things a bit different and unique, but this was totally off track and didn't even have anything to do with what happened on the book. I had some hopes for the movie but as the movie went on, they turned to nothing. The movie was not as good as I though it was going to be, not even close. I advise you not to watch the movie if you have read the books. It will make you very very frustrated.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent

To say Insurgent took creative liberties with the book would be a massive understatement, what it did do was take out many of the unpleasant but intriguing elements, invent major changes in the plot that are not remotely congruent with the books narrative rendering it shallow and patronising to not just adults but also youth.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
264,jameskatt,Enjoyable B-Movie.,6,15 July 2015,"Overall I enjoyed the movie. There were a lot of ideas to chew on. There was a love story. It's a great B-movie.But in the end there were so many holes in the plot. It is a huge sprawling story.What motivates the characters is weird. Humans accepting their place in the world means they have been genetically modified to be like cattle. Why after 200 years did no one every think about going over the wall encircling the city - particularly the divergents who were being hunted down.Why the message in the box was so important that divergents had to be killed? It is like a fight for the fortune in a fortune cookie. And in the end, why the message has any meaning is confusing.And if you are seriously interested in the next installment of this series, it is a depressing downer. I doubt I will even attempt to go to the movies much less watch it at home if it gets made. Insurgent should be the end of the story. It has a somewhat confusing but positive end to the story. And the good guys won.It is great to see Kate Winslet in an evil character. What motivates her to monomaniacally figure out what is in the box is hard to believe.It is good to see so many young actors.Miles Teller is scarily a John Cusack clone. It thought he was John's son.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent

This movie franchise took a great premise, swallowed it whole and then charged movie goers to look at the digested remains for 2 painful hours. Yeah, I'm comparing this film to fecal matter. It's harsh but fitting. This movie is so terrible that it inspired me to write my first review on IMDb. Which is saying something, being that I also saw After Earth and this is my 1st review.The dialogue hurt my ears, Woodley and James acted as if acting as actors who had no idea what acting was, the action sequences were weak at best, and then they wrap it all up with a predictable safe ending.Basically, if your IQ contains 3 digits, run from this movie.

It builds upon the first one (I really feel many of the recent trilogies are really just one movie) and to me also offers a deeper meaning within its story line and the ""divergent"" concepts. Is it perfect? No, but then again that's an arbitrary opinion. I still highly recommend it as one of the most satisfying movie I've experienced of late. Obviously, one needs to have seen part 1. Looking forward to part 3. (PS: I've never read the books).I saw the non 3D version with the excellent Dolby Atmos sound track. This is an action movie with some personal intimate touches or perhaps the other way around, with what I would call some pearls of wisdom beneath its skin.

267,jennabtls,An Amazing Sequel to an Outstanding Series,10,19 March 2015,"Depth and complexity is how I would describe this film! Absolutely brilliant & has officially won my vote over the Hunger Games series. Why? Not only does The Hunger Games and the Divergent series deal with future, post war tragedy era social conflict, but Divergent does it better. Far more complex characters with far more believable character backgrounds and character development and also a more confident and admirable female lead. By not reading the series initially before seeing the films, I am thoroughly impressed with how well the writers were able to create a film to withstand on it's own. I've seen many reviews on here bashing this amazing film without stating why other than comparing it to the Hunger Games and comparing it too harshly against the book series.Looking too closely into the book series and comparing it to the film, yes of course there will be many things missed and left out but what can you really do about having a limited time span and budget? As true fans, I would suspect the love of the books should extend to the love of the film because thats what true fan do! Not to mention, there was effort from the filmmakers to keep the identity of the books in the movie. Job well done!It was outstanding to be able to enjoy this film without having expectations!

274,AliRadicali,"Bland, lazy dystopian sci/fi",4,10 November 2017,"Probably the worst indictment I can give this forgettable franchise is that the only characters with any level of character development throughout the entire trilogy are bad guys and antiheroes. Our heroes, by stark contrast, start off being kind and virtuous and skilled in every conceivable way and thus are never required to grow as characters. I'm not sure if this is a problem in YA writing, film writing or feminist writing, possibly all of the above, but I can't help but notice similarities between the Divergent franchise and the Hunger Games: both of these purport to present a strong female role-model, and yet neither succeed in presenting anything but a petulant Mary Sue who inexplicably finds herself the center of her respective universe. Despite being an uppity go-getter who smashes through dozens of armed men at a whim, Triss is an object: things happen to her not because of the choices she makes but because she is divergent. In this regard Triss, like Katniss is a strange hybrid between the role of the princess and the role of the hero: both the object of the quest as the person going on the quest for said object. The result is muddled story telling without a point, because unlike a classical hero these spunky heroines never really have to grow to prove their worth; as the princess their value is inherent in what they are.Now I could go on to describe how this series features every cliché in the dystopian sci/fi genre, but frankly I wouldn't have cared if the material were competently handled. The operative word being ""if"". Sadly, the introduction to this setting, with its factions and it's bigotry-against-divergents, is done so lazily that you're left yelling ""WHY?!"" at the screen for two films straight before the franchise even tries to answer basic questions about the premise, despite the fact that virtually all the drama stems from it.On the plus side, this franchise had a few interesting ideas, albeit poorly executed, and the visuals were not half bad. Overall though, would only recommend as an exercise in critical film viewing, not as a legitimate film-viewing experience.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent

The finally got Tris' character right, their was just so many details in the smallest scenes of the movies. The only con in this movie, which is a big one, is that they rushed the movie a ton. There was little character development, it was just action scenes upon action scenes. Therefore I am going to remove 1 star because of that. So 7.3/10 For me. :)",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
276,federici218,"A well-paced and exciting film filled with suspense, great performances and a lot of heart",9,25 March 2015,"Last year I went to go see Divergent on the spur of the moment, I knew very little about it but it looked interesting and I ended up really enjoying it. Then I bought the books and fell in love with the series. I'm not usually a big fan of the YA genre or sci-fi/futuristic type stories, and though most people favor The Hunger Games, I never found any interest in the story or the characters, but something about these books (Tris Prior mostly, let's be honest) really stuck with me and I've been anxiously awaiting this movie for nearly a year now.Insurgent picks up a few days after the events at the end of Divergent, where Jeanine orchestrated a genocide on the entire Abnegation faction using mind-controlled dauntless soldiers, killing Tris' parents along the way. Tris, Four, Caleb, and Peter are now fugitives on the run searching for allies and answers. Jeanine now holds control over the city and it is revealed that she attacked Abnegation not only to seize power but also in search of a mysterious box believed to hold a message from the city's founders.I'll start by saying that Insurgent is a much better movie than Divergent. As I said, I really enjoyed Divergent and that's what made me become a fan of the series in the first place, but just purely as a film lover I found Insurgent to be much darker, more intense, with much more suspense, action, emotion, and just overall a much bigger and better film. I have to say I'm really surprised that critics are being so harsh on this movie. I rarely listen to critics and this is probably why, it's not half as bad as many of them are making it out to be and as soon as they start to write about how it's a Hunger Games rip-off they've lost me. This movie is well-paced, with a clear plot and really impressive visuals and performances.Now, as a fan of the books, I thought it followed the book much more closely than a lot of other people seem to think. As always, you have to keep in mind that books and movies are two separate mediums and not everything can or should be translated or included on screen. Insurgent is a 500+ page book with a lot of plot and characters, it's impossible to include every scene or detail into a 2 hour movie, and although they did leave out quite a bit and add in a few new things, I think they did a very good job retaining the essence and characters of the book. Most of the changes they made worked and actually benefited the story, and I don't recall them leaving out anything too crucial.I recently read somewhere that Shailene Woodley has one of the most penetrating screen presences of her generation and I think that's such a perfect way to describe her. She is immensely talented and versatile, and she makes every single moment of every character she plays seem so real and authentic that you forget she's playing a character. In this film alone, she shows so much depth and range - there's grief and guilt as her parent's and Will's deaths haunt her, anger, fear, determination, rage. And she has that rare ability to be both vulnerable and tough at the same time, it's really mesmerizing to watch. But the whole cast was strong, even those with little screen time. Theo James is the perfect Tobias, like Shailene, he becomes his character and it's so impressive to watch him develop his character. So many great actors are in this film - Kate Winslet, Naomi Watts, Octavia Spencer, Daniel Dae Kim, Ashley Judd, Ray Stevenson, Miles Teller, etc. and they all portray their characters so well. The casting in this series is one of the best things about it.My main criticisms are that I felt it was a little too action-packed and CGI heavy. Most of the special effects and action sequences were really impressive but I think it took away from the heart and depth of the story a little bit - then again, I know people generally consume that kind of thing, so maybe that's just me. A lot of the supporting characters (i.e. Uriah, Marlene & Lynn) were extremely underdeveloped and had hardly any screen time, which was disappointing. The film really could've benefited from a little less focus on action and special effects, and an extra 15-20 minutes in order to go deeper into some of the important themes and characters from the book. Lastly, I wasn't a fan of the ending. I think if I hadn't read the books I would have really enjoyed it and been surprised, but the ending of Insurgent was one of my favorite parts and I was really looking forward to seeing how they translated it on screen. It wasn't a bad ending, and I especially liked the song (Holes in the Sky) in that scene, but it was too resolved and upbeat (and why is everyone heading toward the wall?). It was supposed to be a really chaotic, cliffhanger ending and I loved that about the book. But, all in all, I LOVED the movie. They really took everything up a notch since Divergent, and from the moment they showed the Summit Entertainment logo it was exciting and engaging, there was never a dull moment.

The visual effects were good, except for those long shots being made just for the 3D - like the flying above the city in the end, it looked so cheap. The plot is predictable, very slow/boring. Most of the crucial moments are too shallow in their results. The movie completely lacks logical structure - not sure if its written like this in the book too.

Spent all night crying and thinking about how amazing it was. The first movie Divergent was literally exactly the same, on point with the book. Having read the book and finally seeing everything visually coming to life from the book is amazing. The second movie Insurgent though, flipped me backwards, wondering what on earth just happened. Confused and wanting to read the Insurgent and Allegiant again. Although the book and movie of Insurgent were not the same, indeed it was still brilliant. Im really sure that half of the last book (Allegiant) was in the second movie (Insurgent). Now I'm left wondering how the producers will ace the last movie, that's suppose to be split into 2 parts.

I hope, really really hope that the 3D will be in the cinema very very soon. Second, It's kind of different with the book. Yeah, there are several scenes that different from the book. Like, Tris already can hold a gun!!! And they (Tris and Four) are standing while interrogated under the truth serum in Condor. It's not a big deal, I know, just saying. Oh, and Jeanine was killed by Evelyn. And some more.. Third, there is no tipsy Tris. Actually, that is one of my favorite scenes from the book ""The tipsy Tris"" while they were still in Amity. And Caleb didn't help Tris and Four didn't angry!!! Did you read the book? Well, when the tree of them trapped in the middle of factionless colony, they've been attacked, right?! And there is this one scene when Caleb didn't/can't/whatever help Tris and Four been sooo angry,, What I Love form the Movie.

Made me wish they had subtitles!The trailer shows all the 3D-worthy scenes, and for the rest of the movie you are stuck with a blurry movie. Will check it out in 2D, but most likely will wait for the DVD. I have read all books, and honestly, I am disappointed with the movies. It is an intense and well written story, maybe a little too much romance, which I am happy the filmmakers left out. The delivery is not so great. It put the Twilight series into a new light: even though I don't care about teenage vampires, I had to learn to appreciate more, when a movie follows the author's lead: she wrote a bestseller, there is really no reason to mess with the story. Honestly, is it a way better movie adaptation.I missed Edward in the 1st movie (Dauntless initiate ranked 1st, fell out after Peter stabbed him in the eye with a butter knife). Leaving him out in the 2nd movie, took a big hit on the story... The butter knife episode had a powerful message; and I was looking forward to see him back as a Factionless leader. Who was that little punk on the train?I can't understand why the filmmakers were afraid of the suspenseful storyline and the violent scenes; it is a YA story, and the audience knows how to process the information.Four's mother is so young, for a moment I thought they changed the story again, and she is the long lost sister... Or, may be the subliminal message is to promote teen moms...? Let's not go there just yet :)The other big surprise was that the movie theater was only 5-8% full on a premiere night. We usually have to go 1 hour early for any YA movies, buying tickets 1 week in advance is a must; there are three schools nearby and usually a lot of kids show up on premier nights. I hope that is a powerful enough message.I still rated it 7, because considering the poor choices deserved it, but in a world where the Hunger Games is a 10+Summing it up, it has great potential, which hopefully will be developed in movies 3 and 4.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent

After watching Divergent, I read the book and there was an immeasurable amount of detail missing in the movie that was displayed in the book. In other words, I expected Divergent to be like The Hunger Games series or the Harry Potter series, whose screenwriters and authors tried their hardest to explain the book into a movie and succeeded. I gave Divergent the benefit of the doubt. I thought that maybe the writers for Insurgent would learn from their mistakes, but instead they made the second installment of the series an even bigger fail. The movie skipped many critical scenes that would help explain the key events. The ending of the movie was one of the few scenes that shook the crowd.

It seems like everything that has happened in the previous movie is just forgotten. Plot without any logic, no innovation, just repeatedly using the same plot lines again and again. Characters seem to forget everything that has happened to them, they often choose incomprehensibly redundant actions and take irrational decisions. It makes me feel sorry for all the people who spent their time on the special effects, which look great, but unbelievably poor plot just destroys the whole experience, especially after so great first movie Divergent. The first movie must have attracted many fans of titles such as Hunger Games. After watching the first movie, I couldn't wait to see Insurgent. But, unfortunately, now I must say that comparison to Hunger Games is not relevant in this case. Although the special effects are traditionally on a very high level, the poor plot together with the shallow adaptation of potentially very dramatic and epic scenes makes me feel like I should have skipped this movie and rather consider Divergent as one complete story without any follow-up.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent

Stating the factions over and over and over again, proved that they were trying to capture a new audience that had not seen Divergent or read any of the books.My 3 points go to the loveliness of Theo James as always, but that's what held me on until the 35 minute mark until I switched off. Shocking shocking shocking.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
288,maddy-143-605410,Brilliant movie,10,20 March 2015,"I have to say that I think people are being a bit harsh towards this movie. I understand you are allowed you're own opinions, but is it really that terrible that you feel the need to tell people not to watch it. It really isn't a terrible movie. There's action, romance, a great plot, high quality special effects, high quality acting by a great cast. What more could you want? Shailene does a wonderful job of portraying Tris and how she has changed since the last film. She clearly shows what is going on in her head, the toll that losing her parents and killing one of her best friends is clearly shown by the way she acts. She plays it spectacularly. She makes the character feel real, she makes it feel real, and look real. Miles is hilarious, he brings a comedy element to a film with quite tough themes and emotions in it. Theo does an amazing job of portraying a supportive, yet tough Four. Ansel portrays a weak, cowardly Caleb really well. All of the acting is amazing. I believe in many ways it stays true to the book, it has the roughly the same basic plot, with new added extras. I believe that the way they changed it made it more interested as a film, if they stuck with the original reason as to why Jeanine was hunting Divergents, as a film I believe it would have been quite boring to see. What they do in the film makes it interesting. Intriguing even. I really do believe that people are saying too much harsh stuff about this movie, it is interesting, intriguing and has an amazing cast. New and old. The visual effects are amazing. The acting is amazing. It is worth a watch. It doesn't matter if you watch it in 2D or 3D, it is a good movie and I really enjoyed it. Fans will as well.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent

There are a few 'professional critics' giving low scores however if they pulled their heads from their butts they may just chill out and enjoy the film too!The two hours average for each of these films feels about right, enough to establish a story without it dragging on. I would however have been just as happy with another 20 - 30 minutes of content!",The Divergent Series - Insurgent

The story line is fast, very many action scenes than Divergent. If you have been watch the first movie or read the book, you're going to understand the story. But, if you don't include both, I recommend that you watch the first movie and then Insurgent. You will be satisfied with the Insurgent. Insurgent so many action scenes than Divergent. From start to finish, we will be presented with the action scenes are riveting, exciting chases and visuals that will spoil the eye. I was watched this movie with 2D format, and I like it. In terms of acting, Shailene Woodley no doubt. However, the other did not exist as powerful Shailene Woodley. From the Divergent's trilogy books, I was most like Insurgent, because it's very exciting. Insurgent is a little different from the book. However, it is a book better than the movie. However, the action scenes in the movie is very very amazing.The last 30 minutes is the ultimate Insurgent and my favorite part. I love Insurgent more than I love Divergent!!

Awful acting and directing, would defiantly not recommend it for anyone. You might as well go watch the matrix, because it is the copy of that, the only thing good in it is the CGI, thats what the whole movie consists off. Shailene Woodley's character wasn't even in it much, isn't her character the protagonist? Theo James Character was in it more than Tris. For the acting, there isn't any hype about it, shailene showed no emotion or anger, for theo james he was good, he showed everything that was needed. I would say that the movie is good for the fans but thats it. Its just as confusing as the first one for the non-book readers, but the books are suppose to be bad to..

293,nymphychick,The movie was a disappointment.,3,20 March 2015,"Insurgent disappointed me. The acting was poor, the invasion scene was pathetic, some of the plot was empty and laughable, and some things she did didn't make sense. There was a lot wrong with the movie, and the rebel group wasn't even worked up at all.Furthermore, the headquarters for said rebel group have a scene that is the same exact scene that they used to do the Mockingjay ""messages"" scenes, with the rose petals on the broken concrete. Minus the rose petals in this movie, it was the exact same scene.3 of the tests were stupid too, where she had to just be normal, and she didn't even have to try for those tests. And when she was fighting herself, her not-that-really-terrible self, there came a point where she sacrificed herself to her copy and her copy just dispersed, rather than ""killing"" her and waking her up.It would have been an OK movie had it not been a sequel, but being that it was a sequel, they just failed.

As I am aware that for time purposes not every single detail can be included, though, many of the scenes and details that were included occurred in a way that was unlike the way they happened in the book. Several major characters were either left out entirely or their roles were minimized. I also felt as if there was too much fighting and action and as a result the plot line suffered. It seemed as if they were trying too hard to make sure the movie would fit the 3D viewing style, and they forgot about the storyline.If you have read the book, I would recommend that you be prepared for a movie generally unlike the book in many ways. Overall though, this movie has a beyond wonderful cast who performed BEAUTIFULLY.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
295,ziethriel,cliché and emotionless,3,21 March 2015,"Despite (as far as I recall) the first movie being pretty good, Insurgent just betrays everything that happened at the end with an unsatisfying explanation of why the villain is still in power.The movie contains plot twists that a five year old could have predicted, and is generally lackluster in it's dialog. With a weak plot, boring characters, and a total disregard for all character development from the first movie, this was an extreme disappointment for me. I will admit, there were some good scenes. But a diamond smothered in cow manure isn't very attractive.The bottom line is that I didn't connect with any of the characters. I don't know if this is the case, but it seemed like they were trying to fit a lot of things from the book in that didn't belong. The plot jumped all over the place, without getting to know the characters in the plot or subplots.

And finally when the movie comes out, there's a lot of negative comment everywhere. Like a messy plot or such stuff. It makes me unsure whether I wanna watch it or not. But I watch it anyway in the cinema. And let me tell you, this movie is so good. Like that good. It's a journey for me and it took me to this other world. I don't even bother to look at my watch. It's just that good that it felt so fast. Shailene's also great in this movie. She's awesome and so does Theo. I do think that the plot is good and also the visual effects. How ever, there's some flaw that just doesn't work. Or at least for me. One or two plot at the end seems kinda rushing, and there's one or two visual effects that looks really cheesy and bad. It's just for a couple of seconds though. But I think that's it and the rest is great.

It was so amazing looking all that people staying so focused on the film for 2 hours. Just this fact means a lot in my opinion. After I saw the Film I am convinced that Insurgent was a better than Divergent for 2 reasons. 1. More action 2. More Special Effects. Overall this Film like my summary tittle says is an all in one film: 1. Intrigant storyline (even for the people like my friend that Doesn't have seen the first film) 2. An amazing cast and specially Shailene, Its incredible the part when she has to fights against herself. Great performance really. 3. Stunning special effects 4. Fantastic soundtrack all over the film.

I will admit it was different from the book, but personally I don't believe that was a bad thing. In the book, the author spends 300 + pages of Tris moping around because daddy and mommy died and she killed her friend. Although this is still a problem in the movie, it is a lot less focused on. The people who wrote this movie did something the author did not they stuck to a plot and left out meaningless details. They kept all of the heart of the book without making it drag on and on. It is worth watching in theaters. As someone who read the books, I greatly prefer the movies.This does not disappoint.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
299,Elin_lejhage,Better than I expected,7,30 March 2015,"Before watching Insurgent I didn't expect much, based on Divergent. However I stand corrected, Insurgent delivered action, romance and some comedy. It was more unexpected than the first movie and I have to say it even made me tear up a bit. Shailene Woodley did an amazing job as Tris and she delivers a trustworthy performance and she starts growing on me more and more. Theo James also made a great performance as Four/ Tobias and you just can't help but fall in love with his character. I have to say that Insurgent had me on the tip of my toes most part of the movie and I leaved the theater with an unexpected expectation for Allegiant.Great movie, great performances. A movie I would recommend. 9/10",The Divergent Series - Insurgent

I could feel every inch of passion within this film as if I personally connected with these characters in an emotional sense, which by the way is something I find rare in most movies, especially sci-fi films. Though I can't stand movies altering original story lines based from novels/comics, Insurgent made it work and fitted in delightfully like a missing puzzle peace. Props to the producers for that ballzy move. Overall, this movie sent a rush of vivid emotion through my senses; from anger to fear to being absolutely moved and touched from all its glory. A few scenes triggered goosebumps to soar through my body in an epic sensation of emotions. I almost wanted to shed a tear a couple times, but only just almost. Conclusively, this was definitely one of the most powerful films I've seen since The Fault in our Stars, ironically enough. Coincidence?.. hmmHighly looking forward to Allegiant.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
301,kirstyvs,disappointing,4,26 March 2015,"I went to see the movie on Saturday and I have a couple things to say. For those who haven't read the book it would have been a good, action movie. However for the book fans it was a little disappointing. To start off with they changed the reason Jeanine was hunting Divergents and who kills her. Also they changed the whole idea of a hard drive and missed out some major scenes from the book. The book was a lot better and the movie was very disappointing. :( Overall I think that the movie was OK but not the best and the book is so much better as is the first movie they will do the same to allegiant as well.

302,michael-61392,Cinematic Soap Opera Fails the Left-Brain,3,27 March 2015,"I'm convinced that Hollywood either has not the knowledge to creatively discuss in a movie the juxtaposition of a rigidly controlled state vs creative self-determination, or the Powers-That-Be simply won't allow such meaningful discussion.The only recent attempt has been Atlas Shrugged. And that with a fraction of the budget and an entirely different demographic. I would bet that the vast majority of the demographic at which Insurgent aims has not read the book(s). Or most any book for that matter. Most of our youth simply don't read entire books anymore and, therefore, don't think or intellectually analyze much. How many have read Bastiat, Locke, or even Plato whose ideas can be directly compared to Insurgent.The teeth of education have been pulled and our children can now only barely suck milk provided by anemic teachers, with no intellectual meat in sight. What I see mostly in the future is bleak and can be succinctly put in one word: slavery. Or put more accurately: more slavery.This movie could have presented something valuable to the part of our society on which the future hinges. And it failed miserably as will we if our youth don't wake up soon. One of my grandsons is being home-schooled using the Ron Paul curriculum so at least there is some hope as even the idea of liberty gasps for breath. Liberty did not exist in Insurgent and is certainly does not exist in our world either. Is the message of Insurgent that we should be okay with that?",The Divergent Series - Insurgent

This movie wasn't terrible YA like 'The Host' but it's not great like 'Catching Fire'. I read the books and a fan but didn't really mind the changes at all because I love a surprise. It had a lot of action but I really see how it was confusing and had certain sub- plots that weren't really understandable. I really like the action sequences and the simulations, but if i hadn't read the books before the movie i would be really confused and would be kind of lost. I also see how some of the characters like Evelyn (Naomi Watts) and Johanna (Octavia Spencer) and a lot of others had not much to do like in the books. They could have done better it was well worth my time not the best. If you loved the books and don't mind big changes then you'll enjoy this movie.

304,soccerdg,If you enjoy botched book-to-movie renditions,1,10 April 2015,"Insurgent is by far the worst movie I've seen this year. Leave it to Hollywood to completely screw up book-to-movie renditions. Not only was it completely inaccurate, but they utterly destroyed the characters and their relationships. Sure, I expected them to include a bunch of lovey-dovey romantic bull**** that wasn't ever in existence, but c'mon this is uncalled for! The primary sin was crossing the main theme of the series, female agency. In this blasphemy, Tris was forced to be rescued multiple times and to rely on Four in all decisions. Whereas in the book, she was fighting her own battles, on her own, and constantly going against Four. Furthermore, every major (plot point) thought and decision Tobias has in the movie was originally Tris' in the book. Evelyn is completely ignored-and misrepresented-until Janine says her name at the end; Janine is killed in the movie when she is an active character in the third book. Every major woman in the movie was downplayed and their power/agency was handed over to the male characters. You've outdone yourself Hollywood; you owe a serious apology to Victoria Roth! Note: this is not an exhaustive list of sins",The Divergent Series - Insurgent

Some people said it was untrue to the book and, I admit they did add a couple things. But, they still stayed true to the story. I usually don't say this very often but I enjoyed this movie more than the book. I was excellent. In some parts, characters were bland, but most of the time, they did good.

307,bandcg,This movie got my money...,4,13 April 2015,"...and that's about all this movie was good for. I know that Hollywood churns out movies for the sole purpose of making money. Thats why we all get up and go to work in the mornings. However, I don't understand why we are constantly being bombarded with movies based on books if the books are completely discarded when it comes to plot of the movie. Trilogies/Series are the biggest victims. Small changes in movie 1 dictate bigger changes in movie 2, so on and so on...Thus my problem with this film. I wont include spoilers or write an epic about the MANY differences between the book and movie. But I will say how I feel the book is about individual thinking and determination, courage and the struggle to swim against the current. The movies do not portray this enough, if at all. The movie plot goes somewhere that the book plot doesn't even allow as a possibility. For me, this detracts from the reason people love books like this. Strength of characters, emotional connection--Where are these in movies? Particularly this one. We don't generally fall in love with action scenes in novels so why are these piled on when any book gets made into a movie?Most times when I go see the movies made of my favorite books, I tell myself to enjoy the film as a separate entity. And I went in to this movie the same. 3/4 of the way in it is clear Insurgent is just not a very good movie. I will say the movie was beautiful. The imagery and cinematography was top notch. The actors did what they could with limited script. I found the simulation sequences to be entertaining and the action scenes well choreographed.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
308,lovingangel-55047,"Good movie if you haven't read the books, but readers beware because you will be upset",6,25 April 2015,"I have read all three books and am a devoted fan of the Divergent series. I am very mad about this movie. It is NOTHING like the book.First of all, in the first five minutes, Eric and his goons find a mysterious box in the home of Tris and Caleb Prior. The movie then continues to focus on getting the information out of the box, going so far as to create new technology to detect if someone has Divergent abilities. Tris heavily relies on Four throughout the movie, even going with major decisions that she would otherwise speak out against if it were the book. Major characters in the book were changed to minor and there was barely any recognition of Zeke, Uriah, Marlene, Shauna, and many others who were critical to the series. Actually, Uriah only had two scenes or so and Zeke was never mentioned. Jeanine was not as ruthless as she was in the book and is clearly played as if she is a robot, until her little outburst with a ""dead Tris"", which to me wasn't an accurate depiction of her at all.From a moviegoer's perspective, it was good. The actors had their moments, the action scenes were done well, and overall cinematography was great. If I had not read the books, I would have loved it.Now that being said, as a reader, I hated it. The plot completely deviates into something new. Yes, there are similar scenes that happen to that of the book, core characters remain, and conversations from the book is included. But if you are looking for the book-turned-movie, it is NOT there. Tris isn't the strong-willed young adult as she is in the books, constantly relying on Four in situations. In the books, she didn't care about what he thought and did what she had to do to protect those close to her. There was no fight with Christina over the death of Will, nor were there any scenes of Tris leading followers into Erudite headquarters. Jeanine is not killed by Tori for revenge, rather being killed at the END of the movie by EVELYN. The last few moments were also very hard to take in. The message of the town being an experiment comes out, yet there is no Edith Prior, no cryptic message, no hell breaking loose. Everyone joyfully accepts that there is life beyond the walls and run towards the borders. Obviously, that did not happen in the book. There are many other things that changed that I am still trying to comprehend, and way too many for this review. My friend and I agreed that we felt a tad betrayed as readers and that Roth may have sold out to this box idea. The movie had no book in it. We will see what happens with Allegiant, but I'm not holding my breath. Again, if you are a reader, you will be disappointed and wondering where the heck Insurgent really is.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent

Her acting was one dimensional, flat and not convincing. Action sequences seemed disjointed happening quickly without much buildup and ending just as quickly. It left me wondering to often ""what was that scene all about"". The first movie of the series Divergent was much better and satisfying then this. I would definitely recommend reading the book instead. The movie Insurgent will make you understand the old truism about sequels. I thought the acting by Tobias, Peter and others was fine but the movie limited their performance to much. I definitely believe they needed a more emotionally charged starring actress to play Tris.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent

312,BookNerd25,Good but not what it should have been..,6,6 June 2015,"The trailers to this movie before it came out were amazing, but like all trailers it showed more than half of all the good parts. I'd like to address something that another person wrote in their review. I believe his name was Tim Burgess. First off, yes you heard right, they did change quite a few things and that's OK to an extent. The box that Jeanine was trying to have Tris open is not in the book at all, rather it is a file that was on her computer that she had stolen from Abnegation, not a box that she had the Dauntless traitors search for. Also the machines they attached to her for the simulations do not exist in that way. How it is supposed to be is that they have her lay on either a chair or metal table ( It has been awhile since I read the book so I can't remember cause usually it's a chair, but Jeanine was doing things differently that time.) and like usual insert a needle into her neck and inject the serum while being hooked up to a heart machine and wires to transfer the information to the computer. Also you talked about how they say Tris is supposed to be Brave and Strong and all that, but that she didn't look like it and should have worked out more. When they implied/said that about her they meant it emotionally, not physically. Because you didn't read the books I don't know if you realized that the entire series from Divergent to Allegiant takes place in 6 months or less, and from Divergent to Insurgent it had only been a couple months total. So no, she wouldn't have bulked up to that point anyway. She is supposed to seem small and fragile but have the heart of a warrior. I did like the movie but it would be nice if for once a movie that was made from a book could actually follow the book as closely to if not exactly how it goes in the book, but alas that will never happen because each director and script writer has their own take on how it should go. Lastly I am NOT looking forward to the fact that they are splitting the last book into two movies. Worst idea ever!!! Especially cause throughout the entire book it jumps back and forth between Tris' perspective to Tobias', and also there really isn't all that much action or fighting in the last book either. The only way they could do two movies is either A) Have them both be pretty boring or B) Change almost everything about how it goes in the book. I will go see them regardless, but I already know I am going to be disappointed.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent

314,sorrycrane,QUICK TIP: Don't watch it!,1,16 July 2015,"What a horrific movie, this whole franchise of movies set in a futuristic, ruled by a psychotic elite world should be simply removed from the cinemas. That being said, this movie sets a new benchmark for stupidity, lack of ideas on how to develop the movie and the lack of the good old common sense. Tris by far, has been the most annoying, characterless, weak and plain stupid character in a long, long time. I mean who the heck would walk straight in to enemies hands, lured by the fake promise of a long lasting peace. The whole technical side of the movie was also extremely painful to watch. How can a trained solider miss a target 5 meters away from him, and then when the target is covered by a big ass train, 200 meters away, the bullets nearly reach it. Also when Tris gets connected to this SIM card or whatever machine (I tried to take this movie seriously, I really did but come on), she somehow starts to levitate - clearly the wires plugged in to her were not even taut and they did not seem to be able to support her weight anyway. Then when the simulation kicks in, she starts to wiggle like a little golden fish - has no one thought of giving her sedatives beforehand? I mean they are dealing with some mad technology in this movie I'm sure they'd know what a sedative is. When she wiggles like that there's a good chance she's going to injure herself or damage the equipment. It's those small things that drive me insane when watching this kind of movies. But when the small things pile up, the only reasonable way out of this, is to walk out of the room, punch something relatively soft, forget the movie and try to move on with your life.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent

Different from it but post-apocalyptic world with nothing but young people running around in a manipulated society. But its a good entertaining movie for a movie night. The one adult scene was too little to get them in trouble with ratings and too much for this movie. Almost like why did they do it. I didn't really sense a good connection between the two main characters romantically, even though it was throughout, it just didn't seem sincere. Beatrice was distant and distracted, but perhaps that is the way it was supposed to be considering her role. The romance was definitely not the theme here, and a dedicated friend (Theo James) would probably been better. But it didn't distract too much.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
316,montollo,"If confusing audiences with complicated plots and awkward timing ever becomes an art, then this movie has mastered it.",4,20 July 2015,"Divergent had some promise but all that was squandered by its poorly-acted, plot-spaghetti, and full of faulty logic sequel. What went wrong with Insurgent? We can only speculate and point out the obvious flaws but only the writers and producers of this film can truly answer that question. Insurgent has no real feel to me, and it was difficult to make the transitions between action and romantic scenes. What Divergent managed to create was a sense of mystery and fear to know was beyond those walls. Once Insurgent begins and you find out that it's just a bunch nature-lovers having a ""family cookout"", then things go from bad to worst very quickly. Then there are the endless ""we need to talk"" conversations between the two main characters and they're usually nothing more than ""it's my fault.no it's my fault.blah, blah"", but what makes them even more awkward is their timing. I think the writers would have been better off if they had inserted some sort of time-freeze ability to compensate for the bad timing in these romantic scenes. Then if you somehow managed to put all those flaws aside, the confusing logic of this movie will certainly finish off any hopes of enjoyment. For example The original logic behind CHOOSING a faction was a combination of personal traits and a personal commitment to that faction. Somehow Insurgent manages to bypass all that previous logic and decides that there is this simple hand-held device that can read someone's ""default"" faction, which nullifies the ""decision"" part of the original plot. The cherry on top of this nightmare cake is the CGI-heavy scenes towards the end of the movie which do very little to bail out this sinking ship. Sadly enough, Divergent will be remembered as the ""little YA sci-fi that could"" as long as it makes no mention of its poorly implemented sequel.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
317,ovicapilnean,it kinda sucks,2,26 July 2015,"I only made this account just to be able to write this review. I seriously hope Triss dies at the beginning of the next film, cause that girl can't act her way out of a paper bag, her stunt double on the other hand, good job, maybe she can fill in if she's that important to the story.P.S. For Gods sake, your credits go for a full 10 min, just who the hell do you think you are?Now unfortunately IMDb won't let me submit this review because it's too short so feel free to ignore this part of may useless rambling as it's just here to fill some space.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
318,jonathan_cheever,Terrible,2,21 August 2015,"I never write reviews for movies. But this film was such a complete waste of my time, even on a Trans Atlantic flight, that I have to leave a message for someone. I would have rather watched a film I've seen a hundred times before than this again. Disappointed.I am not saying the acting was terrible, not that it was stellar, but this film delivered nothing except a short semi nude scene of Shailene Woodley. Maybe if you are a fan of her you'll not hate this flick. I would have rather spent the time sleeping or watching another bad movie. I am pretty much just typing to meet the minimum requirements to fill this review, but the bottom line is I just want to save your time so you don't have to suffer through some terrible movie to get an ending that leaves you shouting wow this is really it.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
319,norm-82943,A waste of time. Read the book instead.,3,29 August 2015,"Just finished reading Insurgent, the sequel to Divergent and have seen the movie. Gotta say they messed up big time with the movie, why did they change the story that much. I understand that they sometimes need to change parts of the story to fit in a movie but come on, this movie is a total f#*# up from what the book is. So if you want to know the real story, read the book. I don't even want to know who wrote the script for the movie cause he or she is definitely and idiot. Sorry, just my point of view........The author, Veronica Roth must be disappointed in this movie. Divergent, the first movie, was good but this one is definitely a waste of time.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
320,ehppau,Abomination of a Film.,1,18 September 2015,A Lover of the Divergent Series (books) and highly enjoyed the first movie. This second film can only be described as an abomination of a book adaptation. Following the original by less than 5% of the actual story. How it can classified as a film of the book is ludicrous considering the story is completely different.The only thing similar is the vague concept of the film and the character names. Everything is completely re- written and not at all in a good way.If you are a movie collector (including terrible films) Add this to your library. If you are a Divergent Fan you will certainly want to give this film a miss and forget it exists.,The Divergent Series - Insurgent
321,moriibugg,"great,dramatic,entertaining,and action packed",8,8 October 2015,"The movie ""Insurgent"" is great and draws my attention, because everything is so dramatic. The main characters are Beatrice ""Tris"" Prior (Shailene Woodley), Four or Tobias Eaton (Theo James), Jeanine Matthews (Kate Winslet), and Caleb Prior (Anslet Elgort) who is Beatrice's brother in the movie. The movie is PG-13, but because of the language, intense fighting, body counts, glass smashes, sexual content and gunfire, parents should approve first. Robert Schwentke is the director and he keeps everything lively and noisy. He is also known for his previous movies, ""Tattoo,"" ""Divergent,"" and ""Flight plan."" The ""Divergent"" were different from everyone, meaning they could fit in each category: Abnegation, Erudite, Dauntless, Amity, and Candor. Beatrice along with Tobias and others are Divergent, which was against the law and had to be ""killed"" or ""gotten rid of."" Because they were different they could do more and possible be a stronger, so they were a threat. Since they were Divergent, they had to hide out from the Academy Award winner ,Jeanine, the evil, greedy Erudite. Jeanine really played her part well, she came off as the villainous leader with no conscience. Haunted by her past, Tris, has to protect the ones she love. She must find out what her family sacrificed their lives to protect and why the erudite leaders will do anything to stop them. No matter where they went, it was dangerous, especially if the people around them knew Jeanine or didn't want to be punished for harboring fugitives. They did whatever they had to do to stay hidden. Finding out a lot of crazy things and meeting people she thought didn't exist, Tris learned more about Tobias that she didn't know and it changed the game completely.As they stayed on the run they grew stronger and stronger in size and in courage. They had to have each other's trust no matter what. It was very important to their survival. If they lost trust and did not feel protected anymore things could go wrong really quick and destroy and interrupt a lot of their plans. They all had to keep a positive mind and always stay guarded for whatever was yet to come. The young actors/actresses are amazing and played their roles well. They will definitely have you on your feet. The productions were incredible. The effects they have are so mind blowing and engaging. They will have you wanting to actually be there. From the jumping, to the soaring, and heart pounding fight scenes, it is almost like it was real. Their costumes even fit in well with each scene. The movie was so action packed with all of the suspenseful chasing's and the switch up of the different characters.If you really enjoy ACTION/ADVENTURE movies then you will love this one. Its meaning is so powerful. Just because you are different doesn't mean you can't exist with others. Be yourself, because you never know, you could be the one to change the world. Insurgent shows you that fitting in one ""category"" is so overrated. Everyone is made differently for a reason. We all have a purpose.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent

323,jolacosse,Forgettably Bland,2,17 November 2015,"I was coerced into seeing Divergent in the theater and surprisingly found it entertaining. I do respect Woodley's style of acting (adorably innocent and sweet-natured) although unfortunately, for this second installment she seems to lack the 'bad-assery' implied for her character. The spark we saw between the two new lovers Tris and Four in Divergent was no where to be seen here. I was disappointed by the anti-climactic storytelling, being made more unbearable by the fact that I cared very little for the characters. SPOILER: When Tris seemingly dies in the chamber, I felt worse for Winslet's character (she needed her alive for the box thing) than for Woodley's death! Though the 'heroes' of the story did very little to move the story along, they conveniently and predictably kept being carried through the story. This movie was so boring. I can't even remember where the time went. Perhaps I blacked out, but I was in the bath so if I did that I guess I'm lucky to be alive. Pfft. I'm going to be wary of the next two movies, sadly. I'm sorry to the actors who were not written in properly. I did give you a chance! :(",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
324,shouourocks,Get experience,9,18 May 2015,No spoilers here you must go see and buy this movie it had me really thinking about my life. It gave me some insight on my Christian faith as well. In my opinion it really hit home on how we treat people and brand them as evil just because of our lack of understanding. I had a great feeling of empathy during the movie it really drew me in both times I when to see it. I really couldn't imagine anyone else playing those role I feel like they fit well with the actors cast. the crew i know did a great job settings seemed unreal and detailed.This is one series that I would love to be a part of production it seems like a great cast and crew put together an over the top experience for the viewer.,The Divergent Series - Insurgent
325,t_c_anderson,Home for Poor Actors,1,13 September 2020,"Well, I guess even lacklustre actors can find work ... sad but true. Is Shailene Woodley the world's most unemotional, unskilled actor? How she's found any work since is truly a wonder.
And the even sadder note is that the amazing Kate Winslet actually got roped in to this debacle ... and worse, pathetic directing can make you even question her usually top notch skills.
I hope there's a self destruct on all copies of this wretched film so that future generations don't have to think that there was a period of time where humanity had lost its ever loving mind.
Schwentke should spend the rest of his days hunting down and purging ever project he's ever mishandled.
I like to Rate far BELOW One, but it's the lowest I can go.",The Divergent Series - Insurgent
