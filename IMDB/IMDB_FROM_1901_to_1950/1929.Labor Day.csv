0,SnoopyStyle,Slow simmering menace but needs more tension,6,12 June 2014,"It's almost Labor Day 1987. Henry Wheeler (Gattlin Griffith) is alone with his depressed mother Adele (Kate Winslet) after his father (Clark Gregg) left them for his new family. At the store, Henry is approached by Frank Chambers (Josh Brolin). He's injured and threatening as Adele reluctantly gives him a ride back to their house. He's an escaped convict serving 18 years for murder as the police manhunt closes in. Slowly Frank takes on the father role in the house and Adele discovers an attraction for the criminal.There is a low simmering quiet menace from Brolin. The movie moves pretty slowly. It's slowly turns into a romance. Director Jason Reitman never lets go of the quiet menace. To his credit, it never slips into sappy melodrama. It is still a little too quiet and the tension is never that high even when James Van Der Beek drops by as a policeman. Maybe it is for the reason that it's JVDB that it doesn't get the tension. There is one very compelling face off between Brooke Smith and Brolin. However it's only one scene. The movie needs more scenes of that caliber.",Labor Day
1,Prismark10,Labor Day,4,19 December 2019,"Jason Reitman better known for bittersweet comedies has adapted a novel. You can tell as it has a heavy handed narration by Tobey Maguire.Reitman has made a serious melodrama with romantic overtones. Maguire is the older Henry Wheeler. In 1987 young Henry (Gattlin Griffith) encountered an escaped convict Frank Chambers (Josh Brolin) at the supermarket and he insists on some help.Henry's mother Adele (Kate Winslet) takes Frank to their home. Over the next few days while a manhunt is happening, Frank fixes the house, bakes, cooks and acts like a father to Henry. Also Frank and Adele fall for each other.Adele usually hates going outside, she is nervous and has issues because of her constant miscarriages.Labor Day is a corny film, Maguire's narration provides a warm sentimental glow. I think Reitman wanted to make s Douglas Sirk type of movie which was heavy on subtext. It is rather laboured without much tension or drama. It only works because the acting is good.",Labor Day

Then Frank (Josh Brolin) an escaped convict comes into their life and he sets her free for five days.

3,kosmasp,Work Day,9,17 September 2014,"The actors are more than impressing in this one. The story might be bottled in and you may recognize some patterns (could also call some things depicted clichés), but the way the actors carry their load and the movie itself is phenomenal. The direction and editing combined with the sound design elevates this movie too. That helps only if you are into dramatic movies of course.This is not an action packed or too thrilling movie. There is of course tension and even though you do see where it's going, it does make sense. Sense in the way the story unfolds and the characters behave. Obviously there always will be obstacles even if some things seem to be clear and shouldn't seem to be problematic ... the resolution is true to itself and Mr. Reitman made a great movie indeed",Labor Day
4,jboothmillard,Labor Day,7,2 September 2021,"I remember seeing the trailer for this film in the cinema, and I remember it because of the leading stars, I'd missed it a few times on television in recent years, so I rented it, written and directed by Jason Reitman (Thank You for Smoking, Juno, Up in the Air). Basically, set in 1987, Adele Wheeler (Golden Globe nominated Kate Winslet) is a depressed single mother who lives in a rural home with her thirteen-year-old son, Henry (Gattlin Griffith). While they are shopping, a bloody man (Josh Brolin) approaches Henry and makes them take him home with them. The man is revealed to be Frank Chambers, an escaped convict wanted by police. Flashbacks reveal that Frank is a Vietnam War veteran who when he was younger (Tom Lipinski) married his pregnant girlfriend, Mandy Chambers (Maika Monroe). A year after the birth of the baby, Frank and Mandy had a fight, after he asked if he was the father. He pushed her against a radiator, resulting in her death, while it is implied that the baby was drowned. Frank went to prison for murder. Adele tells Frank, seen through flashbacks, that she had several miscarriages after Henry was born, including the stillbirth of a baby girl. This has left Adele with severe anxiety and depression. Henry has acted as both a son and a husband, but he realises he cannot provide everything Adele needs. Frank forces them to allow him to stay while he recovers, but he says he will help with household chores and fixing up the house. During the time he stays, which happens to be during Labor Day weekend, Frank repairs the car, cleans up inside and outside the house, and teaches Henry skills. Adele is a passionate woman who loves to dance and teaches both Henry and Frank separately to dance. There is a day when there is a knock at the door from neighbour Mr. Jervis (J. K. Simmons) who brings over a bunch of peaches, and mentioning the man on the run, but Henry seeing Frank holding and threatening his mother chooses not to reveal the truth. The tension Adele and Henry feel towards the wanted criminal is lessened when he teaches them how to bake a pie using the many peaches that need using. There is also a day when neighbour Evelyn (Brooke Smith) asks Adele and Henry to look after her disabled son Barry (Speechless's Micah Fowler) for the day. Barry is no bother and is happy to spend time with Adele, Henry, and Frank. But he is frightened when he recognises Frank from a television news report, he tries to alert his mother when she returns, but she mistakes his panicking for insisting on leaving, and slaps him. Meanwhile, Henry continues to attend school and subtly talks about his situation with a mature girl named Eleanor (Brighid Fleming), she offers him advice and they grow closer. Henry also continues a relationship with his biological father Gerald (Clark Gregg) who has since moved on and is now married to Marjorie (Alexie Gilmore) with their own children, including stepbrother Richard (Lucas Hedges) who often picks on Henry. They have a meaningful conversation at one point and Gerald admits to his son that his marriage with Adele failed following her culminating miscarriage. Adele and Frank fall in love and plan to escape to Canada with Henry, packing the car and cleaning out the house. Henry has almost no say in the matter, so he goes to see Eleanor one more time before they are due to leave. She manipulates him into thinking Adele and Frank are going to abandon him and he accidentally reveals Frank's past. Adele assures Henry that she would never leave him. The morning they are going to leave, Henry takes a note to his father's house and leaves it in his mailbox. While he is walking home, police Officer Treadwell (James Van Der Beek) offers to drive him home, and Henry reluctantly accepts. The policeman is suspicious of the packed car and nearly empty house, but eventually leaves. Adele goes to the bank to empty her account, the bank staff are suspicious, but Henry helps to defuse the situation. While Adele is gone, Evelyn comes over and speaks to Frank. He claims he is a handyman; she is highly suspicious but eventually leaves. Henry's father finds the note that Henry left and calls the house. Before Adele, Frank, and Henry can escape, they hear the police approaching. Frank decides to tie up Henry and Adele up, making it appear he is an intruder so they will not be charged with harbouring a fugitive, before surrendering. It is not revealed who called the police. Adele wants to plead in Frank's case but is warned by the prosecutor that if she does, Henry might be taken away from her. She writes letters to Frank, but he never answers and returns them all unopened to protect her. Years later, adult Henry (Tobey Maguire) has become the successful owner of a pie shop. Frank contacts Henry, having seen him and the shop in a magazine article. He tells Henry he will be released from prison soon and asks him if he could see his mother again. Henry replies, telling Frank that his mother is still single and lives in the same house. After Frank is released, he appears at the house, and they embrace. Seeing Adele and Frank together again, Henry understands that he no longer needs to worry about her being alone. Also starring Tom Lipinski as younger Frank Chambers. Winslet is convincing as the lonely, fragile single mother who is given a new lease of life, Brolin is terrific as the kind-hearted criminal who changes the lives of the mother and son, and adolescent Griffith is fantastic as the son learning life lessons. I can see why critics see a fusion of the films A Perfect World and Stand By Me, and the emotional development is admittedly questionable, but there are no negatives about that. This take on Stockholm syndrome, the hostages bonding with their kidnapper, is gripping, with tension in the right scenes, building atmosphere and mood, along with surprisingly enjoyable tender scenes, a most watchable drama. Very good!",Labor Day
5,moonspinner55,A romantic fantasy for shut-ins,6,15 May 2014,"Single mother, who has virtually isolated herself from her small town community after her divorce, is approached in a department store by a dangerous-seeming man who insists that she and her young son temporarily take him in; seems he's an escaped convict with a wounded leg (and an infected appendectomy scar!) who harbors a soft, gentle side. Tender with the woman, and paternal towards her kid, he hopes the two will aid in his escape while he, in turn, rescues them from unhappiness. Producer-director Jason Reitman, who also adapted the screenplay from a novel by Joyce Maynard, paces this handsome, serious film carefully, and he has a keen eye for small details. However, while the movie does build in emotion, and feature solid performances from the cast, it never quite feels convincing. The staccato flashbacks (filling us in on the convict's doomed early marriage and the woman's miscarriages) are not only reminiscent of the dreams in ""Flatliners"", but they're far more intense and interesting than the central drama. The inevitable conclusion is capped off by a epilogue designed to send sentiment-inclined viewers out with a tear and a smile, but are viewers really this gullible? Another irritant: the constant product placement. **1/2 from ****",Labor Day
6,blanche-2,what happens over one Labor Day,10,21 November 2013,"Kate Winslet and Josh Brolin star in ""Labor Day,"" a 2013 film directed by Jason Reitman and also starring Gattlin Griffith and Toby McGuire.Winslet plays Adele, a divorced woman who has never really recovered from being alone; her husband has remarried, and she lives in a ramshackle house whose interior speaks of her depression. It's a mess, with stuff all over the place. She lives there were her little boy Henry (Griffith). One day, while they're out shopping, Henry meets Frank (Josh Brolin) who asks for a ride. When Henry tells his mother they're giving him a ride, she politely refuses. Frank insists, and sits in the back with Henry. When Adele asks him where he wants to go, he says, ""your house."" Frank is an escaped convict, and everyone is looking for him. So it doesn't look like they abetted him, he ties Adele and Henry up, planning to leave that evening.This movie is a great example of how a totally predictable story where not much happens can still be a wonderful film and a work of art - in fact, more of a work of art because it is so predictable and yet manages to hold interest. It's the story of family, of hope, and of love. Both Winslet and Brolin act with incredible sensitivity, and Griffith is adorable as Henry, a good kid who sees his mother's unhappiness and doesn't know how to help her.It's a sentimental film, but I didn't mind (well, I wouldn't anyway, but I think even people who don't like sentimentalism won't mind it). I found it totally satisfying and romantic, and wasn't at all surprised to hear it's opening on Christmas Day. There is room for all types of films - this is not a huge blockbuster, just a sweet story that fits in well with the spirit of the holidays.",Labor Day
7,tavm,Labor Day was a fine drama from Jason Reitman,9,4 February 2014,"Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend. He and I were quite intrigued by this drama about a young pre-teen boy and his divorced mom who encounter a stranger who manages to get them to take him to their home and hides there while a lookout is out on him. He has a past that caused him to be jailed but the way it happened wasn't deliberate, just was. The estranged woman herself had some personal problems that caused her previous hubby to seek a new life. And this boy does what he can to make them deal the best way they can with what happens between them. This was quite good in the situations that were handled and realistic in what the results were. Jason Reitman does well in his direction in handling leading players Kate Winslet and Josh Brolin and the way the son is played by Gattlin Griffith. So on that note, I recommend Labor Day.",Labor Day
8,michaelRokeefe,A slow romantic weekend.,7,24 May 2014,"Jason Reitman directs his screenplay of unpretentious, life changing romance. Labor Day weekend 1987 will prove to be like no other for divorced single mom Adele Wheeler(Kate Winslet)and her 13 yr old son Henry(Gattlin Griffith). Adele is agoraphobic and spending her life in a deep depression. Her world functions slowly with a lot of help from her son. Its like a rare occasion for Adele and Henry to drive into town to stock up for the month. While shopping they are approached by a bleeding man, who they take home in hopes of providing aid. They soon find out that their self-invited guest, Frank(Josh Brolin), is a killer recently escaped from a hospital. Law enforcement has the tiny northeastern town surrounded looking for him. Frank in just a short while reveals his true story about being on the run. Now Adele is getting some attention she dearly needs and Henry is receiving the pats on the back he can't get from his estranged father. Just how long can they hide this escapee?This is a romance developing at a slow burn. The story is likable, but seems to be lacking. A glimmer of chemistry appears, although cautious. There is sexual content mentioned, but none to actually see. Is there a climax worth waiting for? Rounding out the cast: J.K. Simmons, Alexie Gilmore, Clark Gregg and Toby Maguire.",Labor Day
9,sunwarrior13,Stellar Acting By Kate Winslet Makes It Worth Watching,8,24 May 2014,"Labor Day is a film that is based on the novel of Joyce Maynard with the same title. It features Kate Winslet and Josh Brolin as the main characters,Adele and Frank respectively,together with Gattlin Griffith Tobey Maguire.It was directed by Jason Reitman.The story focuses on the experiences of 13-year-old Henry Wheeler, who struggles to be the man of his house and care for his reclusive and depressed mother Adele,who was left by her husband. While they are clothes shopping, a bloody man approaches Henry and makes them take him home to look after him. The man happens to be Frank Chambers, a convict who is wanted by the local police after escaping from prison.Certain events happen in this long Labor Day weekend which includes a romance developed between Frank and Adele.Also,we get to see the story of Frank as he reaches adulthood that includes his becoming a Vietnam War veteran,his marriage to Mandy, and his success as a baker owner.At the conclusion,we get to see Frank released from prison after serving his sentence and consummates his love for Adele through marriage.This is definitely a melodramatic film from beginning to end.It tries to capture and manipulates one's emotion especially when the romantic story between Frank and Adele is being told.Obviously,the film is far from being realistic and the narrative is full of flaws as it tries to be an emotionally centered kind of film.There was escapism applied no question about it.That is why many movie critics hated it.But nevertheless,I would consider this one good film if one is willing to overlook reality as Kate Winslet provided an honest and sincere performance as Adele that the viewer will definitely find no difficulty in finding empathy and sympathy to her character Adele.Josh Brolin also did well as Frank and his chemistry with Kate was able to complement Kate's acting.In the end,I would give this a high rating if only for the stellar performance of Kate Winslet alone and one would overlook the flaws of the story.",Labor Day

11,zardoz-13,A Tragic But Inspirational Chick Flick!!!,10,13 February 2014,"""Juno"" director Jason Reitman scores another triumph with ""Labor Day."" Kate Winslet and Josh Brolin make a believable pair in this tragic love story based on Joyce Maynard's novel. No, I haven't read the Maynard novel, and initially, I had no hopes for this tearjerker. Nevertheless, I enjoyed this chick flick immensely, primarily because it defies expectations at every turn. Indeed, ""Labor Day"" benefits from a happy ending, but it is a happy ending come by the hard way. The lovers win in the end but they pay a terrible price for their love.The premise that an escaped prison inmate from a nearby hospital could strong-arm a mother and her son in a department store to take him to their house where he could lay low until the coast is clear is not outlandish. What is outlandish is that the mother and son not only take the inmate home, but they also let him stay with them in their home! This is not the usual ""Desperate Hours"" scenario where a convict breaks out of prison and takes a family hostage in their own house. Anyway, Frank Chambers (Josh Brolin) convinces despondent single mom Adele Wheeler (Kate Winslet) through the sheer force of his personality to take him home and hide him out. Surprisingly, Adele falls in love with Frank and they plan to make a run for the Canada where they can live together without fear of the authorities coming after him. Reitman filters the narrative through the impressionable eyes of Adele's young son Henry (Gattlin Griffith) who narrates the story. Actually, actor Tobey Maguire provides the voice-over for the adolescent Henry before he makes a cameo near the end of the feature. ""Labor Day"" unfolds as a complicated soap opera. Incredibly, the two leads find solace in each other with the blessing of the son. Even a nosy neighbor's invalid, wheel-chair son comes to love Frank because he treats him with so much consideration. Nothing about ""Labor Day"" is pretentious. Reitman draws us into the story, and we approve of both Adele and Frank because they have weathered emotional tragedies involving the loss of children. They were both betrayed by the previous mate. Adele's husband Gerard (Clark Gregg of ""Iron Man"") divorces his wife after she has a stillborn baby. Adele suffers horribly from the experience of birthing a dead child and becomes dependent on her young son. Meanwhile, Frank suffered just as horribly at the hands of his wife Mandy (Maika Monroe) who cheats on him. Frank kills her inadvertently when he strikes her with a blow that sends her reeling against a radiator. While Frank examines Mandy's dead body on the floor, he realizes that their baby is drowning in a tub of upstairs. Both of our protagonists suffer horrible fates, but they win in the end. The scenes with James Van Der Beek's considerate police officer giving Henry a ride home are incredibly suspenseful. ""Labor Day"" has more than a few surprises that keeps the action interesting. Winslet is memorably cast as Adele and she makes this divorced single mom into a sympathetic character. Josh Brolin is remarkably restrained in a taut performance as the escaped convict. Tom Lipinski is impressive as a near lookalike Brolin as a young man. Our narrator has a brief friendship with a young girl (Brighid Fleming of ""Gamer"") who is reminiscent of the heroine in ""Juno."" Altogether, ""Labor Day"" will take an emotional toll on you, but the experience is ultimately rewarding. Writer & director Reitman deserves kudos for making this above-average love story that presents us with characters who are interesting, even Adele's worthless first husband.",Labor Day
12,george.schmidt,Well-acted Reitman attempt at dramatic love story adaptation,7,31 January 2014,"LABOR DAY (2014) *** Kate Winslet, Josh Brolin, Gattlin Griffith, Tobey Maguire, Tom Lipinski, Maika Monroe, Clark Gregg, James Van Der Beek, JK Simmons, Brooke Smith, Brighid Fleming, Alexie Gilmore. Jason Reitman's adaptation of Joyce Maynard's dramatic love story set in 1987 about a recently divorced, downward spiraling into depression woman (Winslet, sublimely perfect) and tween son (Griffith) who encounter a fugitive (Brolin acquitting himself nicely) who presses upon staying with them thru the titular three day holiday weekend to avoid the authorities while discovering there are more than one thing that meets the eyes for all the principals involved. While the acting is very good the storyline is at times telegraphed for an all- too-knowing climax and anti-climax too boot yet well worth the viewing even if it is for its much ballyhooed peach pie making sequence meant to rival the clay-sculpture sensuality of ""GHOST"" (it isn't close).",Labor Day
13,neil-476,Ho-hum romance,7,27 March 2014,"11-year old narrator Henry and his damaged mother Adele find themselves unwilling hosts to escaped murderer Frank.The trailer and advertising stress the dramatic elements of this movie: it is actually a straightforward romance. The good points are that it features a good, if showy, performance from Kate Winslet (which strays occasionally into overstatement) and solid work from Josh Brolin as Frank and Gattlin Griffith as Henry. It looks attractive, and the characters are broadly likable.It was a little too leisurely for me. I found it all fairly improbable, especially the last 5 or 10 minutes or so (Henry becomes a successful pastry baker because an escaped convict once baked a fruit pie for him? Really?). I would have liked to have seen a little more emotional variation written into Henry's character, and Clark Gregg failed to take the opportunity to have a big moment, although that was perhaps in the writing rather than the performing.This was an overwhelmingly average movie.",Labor Day
14,anaconda-40658,A Labor to Watch.,4,11 September 2015,"Labor Day (2013): Dir: Jason Reitman / Cast: Josh Brolin, Kate Winslet, Gattlin Griffith, Brighid Fleming, Tobey Maguire: Manipulative drivel about a long weekend that brought passion and love in the most unexpected way. Kate Winslet plays a single mother battling depression, and Gattlin Griffith plays her wise beyond years son. Josh Brolin plays an injured escape convict who spends the weekend at their house. He means no harm and declares that the murder charge isn't what the news is reporting. There is a back story that regards getting home after Vietnam only to learn that his baby really isn't his. Winslet's husband ran off with his secretary so her son does most of the errands. Starts out interesting until manipulation sets in. He ties her up gently hinting the pathetic attempt at kinky. Neighbors stop by unannounced then they make a peach pie. Even the cop stopping by seems like a bad plot contrivance. This doesn't end with the satisfaction that perhaps director Jason Reitman believes he achieves but this is a major step down after directing great films like Juno and Thank You For Smoking. The principal actors play out their roles with appeal and sometimes conviction but smaller roles are an annoyance. We have Tobey Maguire in a brief role as the film's narrative. The biggest idiot is a manipulative girl, played by Brighid Fleming who comes off like an adult in a juvenile body. Her talks with Griffith are never convincing and further lend reason why this is nothing more than a high budget soap opera unworthy of viewing on any day let alone Labor. Score: 4 ½ / 10",Labor Day
15,HotToastyRag,Fantastic Thoughtful Romance,10,2 September 2017,"Kate Winslet has retreated into seclusion and inner turmoil ever since her divorce from Clark Gregg. She lives with her young son Gattlin Griffith, leaving the house as infrequently as possible and sometimes letting her depression get the better of her, forcing Gattlin to step up and act as the man of the house. On one such excursion to the store on Labor Day weekend, Josh Brolin approaches them. He's bleeding, limping, in trouble, and asks for a ride. The scared, shy Kate agrees and takes him to her house. They soon find out Josh is an escaped convict, but while he holds them hostage, he's unexpectedly kind and brings life back to the house.I absolutely love this movie. From the opening scene, director Jason Reitman sets the pace and environment beautifully for the audience. He gives the film a loving touch, and since Kate and Josh both give the best performances of their careers, I'm sure Reitman gave his actors fantastic direction. He also wrote the screenplay; I've read the book, and Reitman greatly improved Joyce Maynard's original novel.To say I don't usually like Kate Winslet would be the understatement of the year. She's fantastic in Labor Day, as is Josh Brolin. I don't know why they both weren't nominated for Oscars for their thoughtful, multi-layered performances. Hopefully Gattlin Griffith will have a career boost after this film, since it's a treasured commodity to find a child star who can actually act. J.K. Simmons, Brooke Smith, Tobey Maguire, and James Van Der Beek have small but memorable roles in the film, more proof that the Jason Reitman gave everyone fantastic direction.This film has become a staple in my house, one we watch every year in September, and sometimes on Valentine's Day as well.

17,gradyharp,"'I don't think losing my father broke my mother's heart, but rather losing love did.'",9,8 May 2014,"Jason Reitman adapted Joyce Maynard's novel 'Labor Day' for the screen and also directed a sterling cast in one of the little motion picture surprises of last year. Now on DVD perhaps this very sensitive and wondrously acted film will achieve a wider audience. It is a love story, simply that – and unfortunately the trailers for the film suggested another kind of 'Taken' theme. Wrong.Adele (Kate Winslet) is in a state of depression since her husband left her for his secretary after she failed to have another live birth to complement their family of three: Henry (a brilliant Gattlin Griffith) is left behind to care for his near agoraphobic mother. The two of hem in shopping for some suitable clothes for school (the weekend is Labor Day weekend in New Hampshire) encounter a wounded man Frank (Josh Brolin) who asked for a ride – to their home. Frank has just escaped prison where he was undergoing an appendectomy and jumped out the window to escape. (Frank was imprisoned for murdering his wife, which was not actually a murder but a tragic set of circumstances surrounding his infant son – a fact we learn through flashbacks). Frank allows Adele to tend to his wound, but reassures both Adele and Henry he has no intention of hurting them – he just needs a place to rest until dark. But gradually Frank endears himself to Henry and to Adele and they become a family despite the police search that is constantly threatening their privacy. The manner in which this all plays out is as sensitive a love story as has been filmed. Even the ending is not predictable, but it does show the power of trust and love that short Labor Day weekend created.The supporting cast is rich in character actors and the setting and music and cinematography cannot be faulted. This is a very fine film that deserves wide circulation.",Labor Day

As police search town for the escaped convict, the mother and son gradually learn his true story as their options become increasingly limited.'Labor Day' deals with love, family, regret & redemption. It's central characters explore each of those emotions in the goings-on, which keeps the narrative interesting. However, Reitman's Adapted Screenplay isn't full-proof. The melodrama in its final-act, doesn't work & even the slow-pacing needed some serious persuasion. But coming on its plus points, the screenplay is well-worded & has a solid first-hour working to its advantage. Reitman's Direction is mature. He has handled the film competently. Cinematography merits a special mention. Performance-Wise: Kate Winslet is in terrific form. The Oscar-Winning Actress delivers a yet another performance, that is hard to ignore or forget. Josh Brolin is nicely restrained in a complex part. Gattlin Griffith is extra-ordinary. The kid stands on his own & leaves a lasting impression. Tobey Maguire appears in a brief cameo.

19,Hellmant,Reminded me of 'MUD' and 'NOWHERE TO RUN'!,8,4 February 2014,"'LABOR DAY': Four Stars (Out of Five)Jason Reitman (The director of such critically acclaimed hits as 'JUNO', 'YOUNG ADULT', 'UP IN THE AIR' and 'THANK YOU FOR SMOKING') wrote and directed this coming-of-age drama about a single mother and her son who take a convict (who's on the run from the law) into their home over Labor Day weekend. It's based on the novel of the same name (by Joyce Maynard) and stars Kate Winslet, Josh Brolin and Gattlin Griffith. The story is pretty simplistic but the book is supposed be pretty emotional and I think the film rises above it's storyline as well, thanks to a great cast and Reitman's excellent directing.It's narrated by Henry Wheeler (Griffith) when he's an adult in present day (Tobey Maguire). It takes place in 1987, over the long Labor Day weekend, and revolves around Henry (when he's 13) and his mother Adele (Winslet). Adele has been dealing with some major depression for quite some time, so much so that her husband (Clark Gregg) left her years ago. She only leaves the house once a month, to go shopping, and relies heavily on Henry to help her out. While they're clothes shopping (before the holiday) they run into a wounded man named Frank (Brolin), who makes them give him a ride to their house (where he can rest). They then find out Frank is an escaped convict, and supposedly dangerous, but as they get to know him (over the next few days) they learn his true story (and develop relationships with him). We also learn about Adele's troubled past as Henry copes with all the drama (while also learning about girls for the first time).The movie actually reminds me a lot of a similar themed film from earlier this year called 'MUD'. It's not nearly as well made ('MUD' is one of my favorite movies of 2013) but it is a good film. Like I said the story is simplistic and it's the type of movie that could have easily turned into an action flick (in other people's hands) starring Jason Statham or Jean-Claude Van Damme, in his day (and I think I saw that movie; it was called 'NOWHERE TO RUN'). The cast breaths a lot of life into their characters though (especially Winslet, who's amazing) and Reitman's directing is once again superb. 'JUNO' is one of my favorite movies and while this doesn't have the genius of Diablo Cody as a writer I still think Reitman can make any story emotionally and visually stunning on-screen. Not a great film but it's definitely a good one.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xzh1FLmMq4",Labor Day
20,Buddy-51,Troublesome premise mitigated by strong performances and compelling atmosphere,7,5 July 2014,"""Labor Day"" takes some highly improbable material and somehow makes it work - up to a point, at least.In fact, it's kind of hard to know exactly what to make of ""Labor Day"" at first blush. The movie, based on the novel by Joyce Maynard, tells the tale of a love- and sex-starved single mother (Kate Winslet) who falls in love with the ""dreamy"" escaped convict (Josh Brolin) who's holding her and her 13-year-old son (Gattlin Griffith) hostage in their rural home on Labor Day weekend 1987. For about the first 45 minutes or so, the movie actually seems to be endorsing the rather insulting romantic premise that all an attractive young woman needs to spice up her life is a gutter-cleaning, pie-making, baseball-instructing, son-loving man to come along and sweep her off her feet -.criminal background be damned. But as the focus of our attention shifts from the two unlikely lovers and onto the son who's observing and ultimately commenting on this bizarre situation, the movie deepens into an off-beat and thought-provoking look into the complexities of human nature and of familial relationships (Tobey Maguire provides the narration as the grown-up Henry and makes a brief appearance later in the movie).Winslet, Brolin and Griffith all give remarkable performances, as do Robert Clark Gregg and James Van Der Beek in supporting roles. Jason Reitman's moody screenplay and muted direction achieve a dreamy, almost hallucinatory quality that transports the tale to the realm of allegory or fable, where credibility doesn't play quite so crucial a role in our overall appreciation of it (a young girl's noting the parallels between what's happening here and the highly fictionalized and romanticized ""Bonnie and Clyde"" puts the theme into sharp focus). The movie constantly blurs the line between good and evil, and makes it clear that most things are never quite as clear-cut or as black-and- white as people choose to believe they are, especially when it comes to affairs of the heart.It's a shame that, after all this, the authors just couldn't resist tacking on a Lifetime Channel-like coda that indulges in all the dime- novel slickery and sentimentality that they've admirably managed to avoid for most of the movie up to that point. Still, ""Labor Day"" largely triumphs over its potentially troublesome material with its quality performances and direction.",Labor Day
21,bowmanblue,A Labour of Love,6,13 August 2014,"From the front cover and other visual promotional material, you could be forgiven for thinking that this is some sort of romantic drama. And you'd probably be right. Sort of. It's a romantic drama that is masquerading as a crime film.Josh Brolin plays an escaped convict who holds Kate Winslet (and her son) hostage while his wounds heal. It sounds like the plot of a thriller, but it isn't. There's never really enough tension to make it particularly thrilling. Amazingly, the two leads fall in love and this is the story of their coming together.And that's about it. There really isn't that much else to it. There are a few minor sub-plots surrounding the other people in the town and whether they'll discover they have an escaped prisoner in their midst. Again, this area is never truly explored and doesn't add much to the story.Therefore, it's pretty much a straight love story about how two mismatched people find each other in odd circumstances.I read online that this is a 'women's film' (primarily). Possibly, but it's well-acted enough to be engaging to both sexes. It's certainly not fast-paced, so it's probably best you prepare yourself for a slow burner with a pretty straight-forward plot. It's nearly two hours, too, so it never feels like it's flying by.I enjoyed it, however, despite the excellent performances and beautiful scenery, I'm not sure I could be bothered to sit through it again. It's such a simply story that I feel I'll probably remember everything about it for a long time to come (largely because there isn't too much to it!).Nice, but slow.

22,dromasca,holiday melodrama,5,31 August 2014,"Screening 'Labor Day' (which was not brought to commercial theaters in Israel) released on Labor Day 2013 on the eve of Labor Day 2014 was a smart move for the distributors, that brought me to the cinematheque in my hometown. I am not sure that this was the smartest move for me in this American holiday weekend. Based upon a novel by Joyce Maynard, the film directed by Jason Reitman succeeds eventually to squeeze a tear, but demonstrates also that succeeding to squeeze a tear does not necessarily make a good film.Kate Winslet is a divorced mother who raises alone her pre-teenage kid and whose feelings of loss and distress turned into deep anxiety. Josh Brolin plays an escaped convict who finds refuge in their house during the long Labor Day holiday weekend. What starts as a conflictual situation turns gradually in a love story as the man has his own sad history and the two find in each other what they always needed. It's of course a story which cannot end well, not on short term at least, and the principal problem is that the premises of the melodrama are unnecessarily exaggerated for both heroes' stories, and everything is awfully predictable after the very first few minutes.Director Jason Reitman imposed a very minor style in cinematography and telling its story. All characters are uneasy, and this includes the teenage boy whose off-screen voice is used much too extensively on my taste in order to fill in some of the details of the narration, or to guide the feelings of the viewers. I think that I understand many of Reitman's decisions but I cannot say that I liked the result. Kate Winslet is excellent in playing ladies in deep distress, and she does a fine job here as well, but watching her does not compensate the overdose of melodrama. There is nothing too wrong about this film, but I cannot recommend it as Labor Day or any other holiday entertainment either.",Labor Day

24,g-bodyl,A Guide Through Unexpected Relationships!,8,28 January 2015,"Labor Day is a film that may require further meditation. On first glance, the film seems to go nowhere and it may seem like a bland romance, but it's a deeper film than expected and it takes time getting used to the romance. It's nice to see Jason Reitman explore a new theme and set a different tone from his other films, even if the end product results in not being his best film. The characters are worth paying attention to and I really enjoyed the acting and the simple tone of the film. Jason Reitman's film is about a depressed single mother named Adele who lives at home with her teenage son. Their lives change when a man named Frank, a recent prison escapee, enter their lives. With the manhunt increasing tenfold, Frank and Adele begin an unlikely romance. The film works due to the charisma of the two leads. Kate Winslet, who is no stranger to unexpected romances, does a great job as the depressed, nervous Adele who is torn with a dark past. Josh Brolin likewise is excellent as Frank, the commanding but gentle man who may not have committed the crime he is accused of. Overall, Labor Day is a better film that I was expecting. It does have some noticeable flaws. The plot itself got somewhat confusing with the random flashbacks that could use some explaining. I also felt some of the dialog is much more simple than most Reitman films. But I praise Reitman for crafting a interesting, if not tragic romance coming from unexpected situations. It's a different tone and I think he tackled it nicely. I rate this film 8/10.",Labor Day

She usually ventures out once a month from her lovely but seclusive old style Maine home, most often to Price Club. As it is near Labor Day and school is around the corner, Adele realizes she must take Hank clothes shopping, for his pants are too short and won't zip up. So, they go. While Adele is examining the teen racks, Henry asks to go look at the comics. Unspoken is his wish to check out the young female-oriented magazines, to learn more about girls, as he is shy. At once, his world is turned asunder, as is Adele's. Why? A man named Frank (Josh Brolin) walks up to Henry and asks for a ride. He is bleeding from a wound in the side, plus walking with a limb. Most reluctantly, Adele agrees to taxi him. Of course, the whole story comes out before long; Frank is an escaped convict who bolted from a nearby hospital after an appendix operation. In the second story fall, he injured his leg. For all of this, he appears trustworthy and asks the two family members to hide out at their house until nightfall. Yet, even though he ties Adele up for appearances sake, she begins to come out of her shell, as the man makes minor repairs and instructs Henry in baseball. So, a day becomes two, then the entire Labor Day weekend. Yes, the cops are searching for their escapee, even as a romantic relationship is stirring. What kind of ending can be hoped for, under these circumstances? This is a beautiful film, very romantic and suspenseful, which is held back by its obscure title, my view. It also is a tale of a teen learning how to become a man. The scenery is knockout lovely while the costumes are fetching, too. Add on a fine script, from the book by Joyce Maynard, and a deft direction by Jason Reitman and the result is a most worthwhile movie experience. Don't wit till Labor Day, see it now.",Labor Day

What starts off as a way to escape the law also becomes a way for Adele to escape her life and find the one thing she has been missing. So first of all I have to say this is a good movie.

A drama that revolves around three characters, a mother, her son and a felon who is on the run. The cinematography was good and so the direction. Recent best performance by Kate Winslet and it will be remembered for Josh Brolin's best appearance in a romance- drama. Fractionally underrated movie everywhere that needs a support from the movie goers. So why don't you try, it may amaze you.The story sets in the 80s in a small town. An ordinary family of mother and son filled with sorrows living quite a solitary life. Then one day they meet a wounded stranger and enforced to help him. Later they come to know the true identity of the man. The son who is always concerned about his mother feels a man's intrusion may harm her. So, will the family coop with him until he decides to leave is the story that expounds.''I don't think losing my father broke my mother's heart, but rather losing love itself.''A bit of melodrama with tensed scenes often gives viewers wide awake. The highlight of the movie was it is not a Disney movie, but looks like one. You know why, there's no violence like theme like this should have one. At first it was hard to believe in a movie with stars like Kate Winslet and Josh Brolin had no sex scenes. It's better without them and I liked it that way, gives an opportunity for the wider audience.Characters wise, it was a sensitive narration, but overall not an empirical. If you watch it you will come to know it that in reality, people's ideology towards outsiders differs. As a movie, it worked well to be called a fine piece of craft which is absolutely an enthralling. It was way, way better than I thought.

29,eddie_baggins,"Bland and unaffecting, Reitman delivers half-baked goods",4,16 November 2014,"Labor Day is very much a change of pace (a much slower pace at that) for director Jason Reitman who in his short career behind the camera has made a name for himself directing quite snarky and at times quality dramedys. That Labor Day features not an ounce of genuine wit is just one of its many flaws in a tale that squanders an opportunity to create any type of emotional sparks.In the telling of Joyce Maynard's story Reitman has made the cardinal sin of tailoring a film that never once feels like it is going anywhere fast, a slow moving and wholly predictable affair that culminates in one of the worst final acts you're likely to see in some time. The film certainly looks pretty but there is only so far a story largely played out within an old weatherboard house can take you and our central protagonist in Henry played by Griffith is just not strong enough to make us care about both the child and our adult narrator voiced by the ever recognisable Toby Maguire. Labor Day also needed more from its two experienced leads to get it through some pretty murky material.Both Josh Brolin and Kate Winslet have showed countless times over their careers that they're capable of portraying a character with both charisma and smarts but here sadly both are severely lacking in both stakes. Brolin plays escaped criminal Frank with a gruffness that never leaves while Winslet seems to be playing some type of alternate take on her Revolutionary Road character that here comes off as pretty unlikeable despite some genuine affection being felt for her Adele once we understand the root of her sadness. Moments within the film are supposed to show us a bond between these two lost souls, whether it's a heated pie making experience or a game of baseball in the backyard but believability is almost shot away completely when this romance takes place over a couple of days.Many aspects of Labor Day either feel forced or utterly unbelievable – elements such as Frank just wondering about outside fixing the house as the whole towns police force search for him just one example – and a story that should of mixed in a coming of age tale with a genuinely affecting romance, merely becomes a watchable yet instantly forgettable journey with some miss-timed direction by director Reitman.2 far from normal pie making experiences out of 5",Labor Day
30,leonblackwood,Emotional Drama! 6/10,6,10 August 2014,"Review: I quite enjoyed this touching story about a man whose on the run after escaping prison and ends up falling in love with the lady who offers him a lift with her son. The storyline was very well put together and the performances were emotional and extremely realistic. The movie does take some time to get going and it slightly predictable but still a joy to watch. It really does make a difference when you get top class actors acting together with a decent storyline. Brolin & Winslet are great and the little boy also added intensity to the sensitive situation. Anyway, if your into your emotional dramas then this movie is a great watch. Enjoyable!Round-Up: It's weird that I hadn't heard of this movie before it got released on DVD because Brolin and Winslet are top actors who usual star in big budget movies. Brolin, who starred in the weak Old Boy and takes the lead in the new Sin City, has made some bad choices in his career but, his good does outdo his bad. He was brilliant in No Country For Old Men and as the kingpin in the second Wall Street movie, and he shows his professionalism in this movie. Winslet seems to only come out of the woodwork when she really likes a script because she has already proves herself as a top a tree in movies like the obvious Titanic and I loved her performance in Revolutionary Road. Anyway, the planned getaway was appalling, which I blame OK the writer, but the ending was sweet and emotional. Budget: $18million Worldwide Gross: $19millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there drama/romance movies about a couple who get together under the worse circumstances. 6/10",Labor Day
31,howard.schumann,The acting is wooden and one-dimensional,5,2 February 2014,"It is definitely conceivable that an escaped convict guilty of murdering his wife and child could force his way into the home of a single mother and young son and suddenly turn into a loving father figure, gourmet cook, and handyman. It is just that in Jason Reitman's Labor Day, the whole idea seems absurd. Based on a novel by Joyce Maynard and adapted for the screen by Reitman, the film features Kate Winslet as Adele Wheeler, a zombie-like mother of thirteen-year-old Henry (Gattlin Griffith), depressed after her divorce from her unforgiving husband, Gerald (Clark Gregg) who dumped her to marry his secretary.Narrated by Tobey Maguire as the adult Henry and set in 1987 in Massachusetts, the fugitive Frank is played by Josh Brolin who looks like he just escaped from a beer commercial rather than the penitentiary. He is the epitome of masculinity with a soft touch, the realization of every lonely housewife's dream. Though the cast is impressive on paper, the acting is wooden and one-dimensional. Winslet and Griffiths maintain the same blank, apprehensive looks on their faces throughout the film, without even the saving grace of genuine fear or anger. Needless to say, the film contains neither humor nor irony.Though Adele rarely leaves her house, she makes an exception when she goes to a department store to buy some new school clothes for Henry. For some reason that has nothing to do with a contrived plot, the fierce-looking, wounded Frank, just happens to be hanging around the store after escaping from the hospital following an appendectomy (of course, where else would a convicted murderer on-the-run go but to a department store?) Forced to give him a ride to her house, Adele buys his story that he just wants to stay a few hours and meekly agrees to be tied her up to keep up appearances.Fond of all this attention, Adele asks him to stay another day because of the uncertain train schedule and he ends up as a house guest for the Labor Day weekend. The home invader then shows his gratitude by fixing an oil leak in the family car, washing and waxing the floor, cleaning the gutters, teaching ""Hank"" how to throw and hit a baseball (a skill you think he might have picked up over the course of thirteen years), and showing love and respect to a disabled boy (Sheesh! the things you learn in jail). Of all his skills, however, the stand-out is his ability as a cook which he shows off proudly with his chili and homemade biscuits.Further, in order to complete the winning triumvirate of mom, baseball, and apple pie, Frank turns a bucket of over-ripe peaches dropped off by a neighbor into a sumptuous peach pie. No, it's not an apple pie, but why quibble? In a scene destined to be the fodder for jokes by late-night comedians for many years, cinematographer Eric Steelberg's camera dives into the mixing bowl showing the interweaving motion of the three hands of mom, devoted son, and escaped convict stirring the gooey fruit. According to Frank, ""a pie crust is a very forgiving thing"" but, to paraphrase attorney Joseph Welch, the forgiveness for that scene will have to come from someone other than me.Things only go further downhill from there. While frantic news stories flash over the TV, unsuspecting neighbors come and go, flashbacks of the protagonist's younger days generate little light, Henry gets his first kiss from Eleanor (Brighid Fleming), the strange new kid in town who seems to be somewhat of an oracle on abandoned children, and Adele teaches Frank how to dance the rumba. While the unnerving background score by Rolfe Kent invades our senses, the melodrama escalates along with the endless epilogues. Though Labor Day actually contains the seeds of a good story and might have been made into a believably involving drama, under Reitman's direction, it has more inadvertent laughs than Juno had wisecracks.

33,l_rawjalaurence,Intense Melodrama That Loses the Courage of its Convictions,7,12 March 2016,"The plot of LABOR DAY is straightforward enough: depressed single mum Adele (Kate Winslet) struggles to look after thirteen-year-old Henry (Gattlin Griffith). Suddenly an escaped prisoner Frank (Josh Brolin) rudely interrupts the rhythm of their lives - although initially frightened of him, both Adele and Henry come to admire Frank as he helps to create a new (and idyllic) family life for them.The plot is a familiar one, exploited for horrific effect in movies such as THE NIGHT OF THE HUNTER (1955), but here used to prompt reflection on precisely what constitutes a so-called ""criminal"" mind. Director Jason Reitman does a fine job of recreating a hot- house small-town atmosphere in Massachusetts, c.1987, where all the inhabitants know one another and keep ""dropping in"" at unexpected moments, making the job of concealing Frank from prying eyes that much more difficult. Despite the location, it's clear that the residents of this town keep themselves to themselves: when neighbor Evelyn (Brooke Smith) comes to visit with her wheelchair-bound son Barry (Micah Fowler), she literally foists Barry on Adele, in spite of Adele's obvious protests. In this kind of environment, it's hardly surprising that Adele should find Frank so attractive, both physically as well as emotionally.Reitman contrasts the adolescent Henry's reactions to Frank with flashbacks to Frank's troubled childhood. We learn how Frank, despite his obvious virtues, never really had a chance in life - as the child of a troubled family with a murderous secret to conceal, he never really knew what stability was like. Hence his willingness to stay at Adele's, despite the obvious personal risks involved.Henry has a profoundly ambivalent attitude towards Frank's presence. While obviously happy for his mother, he feels somehow shut out from this idyllic family life, a fear that is exacerbated after his conversations with fellow-adolescent Eleanor (Brighid Fleming), whose turbulent background has given her a jaundiced view of parenthood. Henry believes himself to be in love with her (perhaps for the first time), and hence experiences an inner conflict: should he believe Eleanor or trust in his mother?The film does a grand job of analyzing the complexities of these relationships. Reitman's camera-work is intense, with tight close- ups alternating with establishing shots focusing on the claustrophobic atmosphere in which the drama takes place. Given the care and attention paid to setting up the central conflicts, it's a shame that the film's ending has to be so sentimentally tame. We learn what has happened to Henry in the intervening years since 1987; likewise Frank and Adele. Everything seems to go favorably for all them - an outcome redolent of Hollywood at its mushiest rather than a logical consequence of what we have previously seen. We end up feeling rather disappointed, as if we have been somewhat short-changed by a film with such promising beginnings.",Labor Day

Well, the couple Adele-Frank is nicely elaborated, but as Kate Winslet is ""stronger"" than Josh Brolin, and she spends more time on screen, there is no even ""triangle"", Frank is more on the background, and flashbacks related to him appear too abruptly and short.

36,estebangonzalez10,Ill conceived plot,4,4 June 2014,"¨I don't think losing my father broke my mother's heart, but rather losing love itself.¨I admire director Jason Reitman's work (Juno and Up in the Air being my favorites), but I have to admit his screenplay for Labor Day was a mess. I really found it difficult to believe that any of the characters here would behave the way they did, and that took me completely out of the movie. There were some awkward and ridiculous decisions made by each one of the characters during some point of the movie that never allowed me to sit back and enjoy it. The premise is so out there that neither the suspense nor the romance worked. At the end, Reitman tried to save the film by giving it a schmaltzy and sweet ending, but it felt completely out of place. The only thing the film succeeds in is in making me want to go try some of that peach pie they made. Reitman knows how to place and move the camera, every shot was at the right place, but the senseless story hurt the film. Not even talented actors like Josh Brolin and Kate Winslet were able to make their characters believable, and the narration from Tobey Maguire was painful to listen to. Not for one moment was I able to buy into the scenario (a guy escapes from prison, and in order to hide from the police, forces a mother and her son to take him in to their home and then teaches them how to bake a pie and play baseball). The screenplay was adapted by Jason Reitman from Joyce Maynard's novel, which I have never read, but if it's anything like the film I plan to stay away from it. The film centers on a 13 year old boy named Henry Wheeler (narrated by Tobey Maguire as an adult, but played by Gattlin Griffith as the teenager) who lives with his depressed mother. Ever since her husband abandoned her, Adele (Kate Winslet) avoids going out and remains secluded indoors as much as possible. Henry spends most of his time with her, although some Sunday's he spends with his father, Gerald (Clark Gregg), and his new family. Henry and Adele's life takes an unexpected turn when one weekend morning they go out shopping and encounter an escaped prisoner. Frank (Josh Brolin) forces Adele and Henry to take him to their home where he can hideout and recover from a wound after escaping from a hospital where the prisoner was being treated for appendicitis. At first Adele and Henry are frightened of course, but Frank treats them well and even ends up doing most of the house work. The events that take place during the Labor Day weekend end up changing all their lives forever.The film tries to balance the suspense and romance, but due to the premise it never seems believable. For instance their's Frank who has to force this family to take him to their home where he should be hiding out and recovering, but he ends up cleaning the place and teaching Henry how to play baseball in the yard. He also teaches them how to cook pies, of course a necessary plot point in order for the audience to forgive Frank for literally taking the family hostage. It also gives the film an excuse to allow Frank and Adele to fall in love with each other, but that seemed completely implausible considering the situation. I never bought into the story and it all felt forced and awkward. Even the friendship blossoming between Henry and the girl from Chicago that had just arrived felt awkward and every single conversation they had felt like an excuse to build unnecessary suspense. I don't consider myself cynical and I tend to enjoy some romantic dramas, but this was one that never felt authentic and where every situation seemed improbable. Labor Day is an unlikely romance that simply didn't work for me and wasted the talents of Winslet and Brolin. The third act is better than the first two, but it just comes a bit too late and it is founded on a relationship I never believed in the first place.",Labor Day

39,aharmas,We will always remember this holiday,9,7 February 2014,"For openers, how can anything with Kate Winslet go wrong? She is a splendid actress with a tremendous range. She has given us full bodied characters full of energy and a desire to live to the fullest; such was Rose in ""Titanic"", and she can show pain at most unbearable levels, with the guilt-ridden wife of ""Revolutionary Road"". In fact, she keeps surprising us with the power behind each character, and the agoraphobic, hurt, and lonely woman here is one of her best portrayals.A divorcée with a young 7th grader suddenly finds herself in the middle of a crisis, as this fugitive comes into her life, and in the most unexpected way brings some passion to her tortured soul. Watching her fearfully walk out of her home to do the simplest errands is heartbreaking. There is pain in her eyes, hesitation in each step she makes. Tears and anxiety are not far behind. Your heart breaks as you see how terrible her life must be, and it's horrible to see how much she wants to take care of her family, and this proves to be a source of more stress and pain.You would think allowing the runaway into her life will end up to crash and fall into a abyss of madness; instead the opposite occurs, and she regains some of her will to live, passion causing tremors in her fingers, and soon her perspiration is not only the result of a September heatwave. She is embracing life as she meets a man who at other times could have been her perfect soul mate. She is getting a second chance and she rushes to embrace it.There is a back story to the fugitive. He is apparently a much nicer man that the media portrays him. Maybe he's not completely innocent, but we soon realize that this poor might just be a victim of being at the wrong place at the wrong time. We still manage to see his influence in her life, and those five days are among the most memorable for a mother and a son, and how everyone is getting a second chance to realize that life is indeed full of wonderful things.The movie is full of love, pain, anticipation, fear, anxiety, and it is all there for the audience to accompany the three leads on their difficult journey. A young man comes of age, a woman suddenly seems to be getting a second chance, and a man demonstrates that he will enjoy a few days of freedom to the fullest now that he has a small chance to finally have a real family.""Labor Day"" doesn't disappoint. It is pretty easy to follow and enjoy. There's no elaborated situations, the emphasis is on reality, not distracting camera work, fancy dialogue, or reliance on loud and vulgar language, though there is plenty of opportunity here to use offensive vocabulary in the film It's a bit like an old fashioned romance, one with more tragic overtones that we normally see in a Hollywood movie.

So I went along with her to see Labor Day, the story of an escaped convict and a repressed divorcée, just this side of Madison County, who fall helplessly in love. (I wanted to escape too.)That faint whiff of failure continued to spread throughout the theater as I sat there dumb-founded watching Labor Day, an inane tale of love and longing, That ever-reliable filmmaker, Jason Reitman (Juno, Up in the Air, Young Adult), has his first misfire and it is an unintentional laugh-fest of overripe characters caught in overwrought situations. It's the closest thing to a Barbara Steele / Nicholas Sparks collaboration without their direct input.Josh Brolin plays the escapee named Frank Chambers. He is equal parts handyman, cook, dancer, and lover, that perfect mix of manliness and sensitivity that can only be found in a misunderstood felon. Brolin acts the part with a low-growl and a shirtless abandon. Kate Winslet plays Adele, a woman with all bottled-up emotion just waiting for the right moment to allow her inner woman to emerge, and, of course, you know it will in this formulaic soap opera. Just give her a Yoo-hoo and stand back! Along with her son, Henry (well played by Gattlin Griffith), Frank kidnaps the two and takes them hostage, only to have this trio of mismatched souls find the true meaning of love and happiness during captivity one fateful September weekend.If the way to a man's heart is through his stomach, then Labor Day's characters must have indigestion the way they chow down on all things edible. Their appetites become insatiable as they eat and lust after each other. With all their bated breath moments and yearning glances, it's more than inevitable that the two connect and consummate their love. Through the main course of the film, the characters dine on homemade chili (with one being spoon-fed with hands bound) and, in an uproarious Pillsbury's bake-off, make a spectacular peach pie (with all hands kneading the dough into a wild sensual frenzy). Dietary restriction should have applied in this silliest of screenplays, also written by Reitman.The film is an empty-headed mess with so many leaps of logic that the plot becomes such hopeless hokum. Making this movie may have been a labor of love for the director, but it's just plain labor to sit through this wallow. Labor Day wants to have its pie and eat it too. I'd pass on this course.

42,rannynm,A deeply touching testament to true love and the unexpected ways we find it,10,3 February 2014,"""Labor Day"" is a deeply touching testament to true love and the unexpected ways we can find it. Adele, played by Kate Winslet, is a single mom struggling with severe depression and her son Henry has to take care of himself and his mother since she has difficulties leaving the house. One day, on a trip to the supermarket, Henry and Adele's lives change forever when they meet a man named Frank who is on the run from the law. Intimidated by the stranger, Adele agrees to help the man despite the fact that he is a wanted fugitive. Over the course of the next four days, Adele and Frank fall deeply in love, something that the two of them never thought they would experience again. However, things get complicated as the man-hunt continues and they realize that they don't have many options left.I am absolutely in love with this film. It is so powerful and takes a new look at love and the second chances people can have. ""Labor Day"" is so incredible - every aspect of the movie mixes together perfectly to create a work of art. The visuals are incredible because the scenes are all relatively simple, but each shot is so sensory oriented that it allows the audience to experience what it was like for the character. The locations, costumes and set design are so authentic, and the soundtrack is very fitting for the film and it all comes together to create the perfect the perfect experience.The acting in this film is phenomenal. There are very few characters and minimal dialogue, so everything is conveyed primarily through simple facial expression and the amazing film work. Kate Winslet does a superb job in this role and is able to communicate more emotions with her technique of subtle expressions than words ever could. Josh Brolin portrayal of Frank is absolutely perfect. He's able to break down the stereotypes placed on his character in the beginning of the film and shows that there is always more to the story than what is on the surface. I also think Gattlin Griffith, who plays Adele's son Henry, shows his characters struggle of having to be the ""man"" of the house in a very powerful way. You get the sense that he is terrified about what could happen to his family - his mother and himself - once Frank enters the picture, but he still tries to be strong. I love watching his character develop as Henry realizes that Frank might just be the best thing to ever happen to him and his mother. There are so many moments in the film where it seems as if something is going to go terribly wrong for the couple and the suspense of waiting to see what will play out adds an unexpected element of fear to the film. Kate, Josh and Gattlin are fantastic at giving the sense of not knowing what will happen to them in the near future and it really raises the stakes for the family.Something else that I love about this film is how throughout the movie there are short flashbacks of the past and it is done in such a way that it is hard to tell whose past it is. I think this is neat because it shows that Adele and Frank are more alike than it seems and it is a miracle that they found each other. ""Labor Day"" is so touching that by the end of the film I was crying harder than I have at a movie in a really long time. It was so incredibly beautiful to see how love can endure no matter what trials surface and no matter how long people are apart. I'd like to believe that everyone can find a love like that and this movie shows that no matter how hurt you have been, there is always another chance for love.I recommend this movie for ages 13 to 18 because it is very emotional and a bit mature so it may be challenging for younger kids to understand the storyline fully. Overall I give ""Labor Day"" 5 out of 5 stars because it made me laugh, cry, and it tugged on my heart strings.Reviewed by Raven D., KIDS FIRST Film Critic.

43,Sergeant_Tibbs,"Despite dips into sentimentality, Labor Day is tender and heartbreaking.",8,31 December 2013,"I loved the Labor Day script. I read it a few months ago and while I had doubts about the concept and Jason Reitman at first, it ended up winning me over within pages. Maybe it's because it was written with such wit and tenderness, but it's a human story that truly flows with the emotion delivering the images and intimacy required to express its ideas, dancing just above sentimentality. Although its story is slight, it was satisfying and very rich, taking a situation I'm surprised it hasn't been explored in a more popular film and hitting major themes of family structures and cycles of life. It truly disappoints me to hear that people are not only disliking it, but hating it. It feels like it's being approached from the worst perspective, bracing themselves to cringe. I'm not exactly a Reitman fan either. I think Juno is terrible and it took a rewatch to fall in love with Up In The Air after thinking it was mediocre the first time.While Labor Day may be far from Reitman's regular tone, in execution it instead highlights his style of energetic and creative cinematography and editing. Like the effect of the script, you can feel the heat and taste the food. Surprisingly, as it's a particularly challenging role given that these types of performances usually struggle, our kid protagonist Gattlin Griffith holds his own among the cast. Kate Winslet is reliably great. These characters seem to be her comfort zone and she's certainly perfected her craft, but we don't often enter her headspace. However, the real standout is Josh Brolin. His performance is the epitome of less-is-more and sells his complex character perfectly. Sinister and cold, yet deep and sensual. The idea that he's doing all the mundane things he hasn't been able to do in decades brings simple delights. It's the measured moments where he cracks that show the breadth of his performance as he breaks down the stereotype of a convict.Unfortunately, some characters don't work very well, such as kid actors Barry and Eleanor who don't have the conviction to make their scenes work. The flashbacks to Frank's past don't have the same effect as the script despite the eerily similar looking young actor, as they're more confusing than clarifying. Contrary to common complaint, this is not like a lifetime movie. I happened to have watched some recently and they're more concerned with twists and insanity, instead Labor Day is closer to a 1950s domestic melodrama. Think more Far From Heaven than anything. I have a little bias as to how much I like this film, but I walked into the script blind too. Though it need not have had the orchestra swell during the on-the-nose summary lines about what the film's events mean to the characters, Labor Day's emotional punch of two souls bonded by tragic pasts still breaks my heart. I'm just glad Tobey Maguire helped rather than hurt.8/10",Labor Day

On the other hand, when convicted murderers have surgery in Texas, they are either handcuffed to their beds in the recovery room, or the procedure is done in their cell with a sharp spoon. Things cannot be THAT different in a blue state such as Massachusetts, where the story of LABOR DAY takes place (though down here Labor Day NEVER falls on a Tuesday!!). Further, even a Texan would be hard put to jump out of his second floor hospital room minutes after an appendectomy, smash up both legs, ride to a single mom's house, immediately Remortar the crumbling away stones of her cellar entrance (not to mention mopping and waxing every floor in her home, changing her oil and furnace filter, Lubing her doors, cleaning the gutters of her eaves from a ladder, nailing down a squeaky stair step, organizing every item in her home, babysitting the special needs neighbor boy, giving her family a firmer philosophical foundation, teaching her and her son to bake pies and hit a baseball, as well as learning the rumba himself).

48,spookyrat1,Unlikely Love Story Avoids the Schmaltz!,7,3 May 2020,"Labor Day is an admittedly implausible romantic drama, made believable by a trio of excellent performances from Kate Winslet, Josh Brolin and Tom Lapinski, combined with the assured direction of Jason Reitman from his script, which he adapted from the novel by Joyce Maynard.Through a series of personal traumas, divorcee Adele, becomes agoraphobic, with much of her everyday running around outside her house, being done by her young adolescent son Henry. On a rare visit to a department store with Henry, they are intimidated into assisting menacing escaped convict Frank, to hide from authorities at their home, just prior to the beginning of the US Labor Day weekend in 1987. Over the course of the weekend, Frank unexpectedly reveals a compassionate, empathic side to his character which spawns a surprising bond, between all three protagonists, causing them to evaluate their past lives and look to their futures with new eyes.Flashbacks to both Adele's and Frank's past lives provides a solid evidence-based foundation to engender belief in their developing Brief Encounter type romance. This is spiced with notable levels of increasing suspense, as the searching police circle ever closer to Adele's home, whilst neighbourly interventions may yet be the cause of an accidental discovery, that the house has an extra occupant.Kate Winslet continues to astound with her acting range. She is just so convincing as an inwardly romantic soul, who, fate has seen fit to deal her a barely playable hand of life. She quietly, inwardly yearns for some happiness to fill the void. Josh Brolin is totally believable as a convicted murderer, who dampens any suspicions we and Henry may have over his culpability, with the soft utterance of, ""It ain't what they said it was"". Later flashbacks confirm his story. He complements Winslet admirably.The young Lapinski more than holds his own opposite his more experienced co-stars and it is through his eyes that we see this dramatic and sad tale unfold.Frequent Reitman collaborator Eric Steelberg shoots the film very appropriately in warm, late summer shades of gold, emphasising both the season of the year and the years that have passed. Intriguingly romantic, Jason Reitman never allows proceedings to become maudlin, nor melodramatic. The movie is more subtle, darker and less comic, than many of his better known films, such as Juno and Up in the Air, but in my opinion, despite only receiving mixed critical praise and failing commercially, Labor Day is a film worthy of both recognition and respect.",Labor Day

The actors always do their best, but the plot gives them nothing to work with. Toby McGuire is the narrating voice. Too sickeningly sentimental and slow. Agents should read scripts.The screenplay by Reitman is based on the book by Joyce Maynard. The fault is not Reitman who is usually on the mark. But he chose the book and wrote the script. The only son has grown up and relates the story of his mother's loss of his father to his secretary. The father is given voice and tells the son he left, because he couldn't stand the mother's emotional reaction to loss. The mother is depicted as depressed. She also is characterized as a seductive mother. This trait is a severe abuse of a mother over a son. This is emotional abuse. Sons whose mothers are seductive towards them cannot relate to women without problems. If this is the case here, the script could have exploited that and interest would develope. She needs to act more seductive in the script. She needs to act. Give her something to do. It must have been an enormous frustration to act in this film.",Labor Day
50,bryank-04844,"'Labor Day' won't fascinate everyone, but if you give it a chance, I'm sure you'll walk away satisfied.",7,22 August 2015,"In a shift in tone and subject matter for director Jason Reitman ('Juno', 'Up In The Air'), his newest film 'Labor Day' is a sweet tale of love and starting over. Originally written by Joyce Maynard with a screenplay treatment by Reitman himself, this gem of a film is a slice of great pie. Sure, this situation would never play out as it did in the film, but is one that we would hope for. With a stellar cast that includes Kate Winslet, Josh Brolin, Tobey Maguire, J.K. Simmons, Gattlin Griffith, and James Van Der Beek, 'Labor Day' is a holiday I'd revisit again and feel good about it.'Labor Day' was originally a novel by Maynard, and is transferred to film almost perfectly. The film is set in the mid 1980s as we meet single mother Adele (Winslet) and her young boy Henry (Griffith). Adele's ex-husband left her for his secretary (Clark Gregg) and still plays a role in Henry's life. However, the divorce has taken a large toll on Adele. So much so that she is afraid to leave the house but once a month to do grocery shopping. Meanwhile, the young Henry is left to take care of his mother, go to the bank, and fix small things around the house.While at the local super-market, Henry comes across a stranger named Frank (Brolin) who seems to be bleeding from his stomach. In what seems in a blink of an eye, Frank forces Henry and Adele to help him heal and avoid the authorities. Come to find out, Frank is an escaped convict. His crime was murder, as we see his back story unravel through a series of wonderfully crafted flashbacks throughout the film. Frank is a great man who is patient, pleasant, extremely nice, and can cook a mean pie.In the part that would never happen in real life, Adele and Frank begin to fall for each other over the course of a weekend, as Frank fixes the house up, teaches Henry to bake a pie and play catch, and even dances the night away with Adele. Meanwhile, Henry and Adele have to keep Frank a secret as the police are searching for him night and day. Soon, Adele is able to get out of the house with ease and begins to trust people again. On the other hand, Henry is discovering girls and learning what it takes to be a man.Reitman tells this wonderful story at a magic pace, as we get enough time with these character to truly fall in love with them. It's also a beautiful film to look at. Brolin and Winslet turn in solid performances and Griffith shines as the kid who is starting to find himself. One of the flaws of the film is some of its dialogue is a bit on the cheesy side with a few clichés that are hit too hard on the nose. But it never detracts from the overall viewing experience. I really loved seeing the 1980s set design. From the old school television sets to the 'Star Wars' and 'E.T.' posters on the walls, and even the characters watching 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind'. It really brought me back to my childhood. 'Labor Day' won't fascinate everyone, but if you give it a chance, I'm sure you'll walk away satisfied.",Labor Day
51,Likes_Ninjas90,Hopefully this terrible film is a small blight on what should be an otherwise fruitful career for the director,1,4 February 2014,"An autopsy should be performed on Labor Day to see what went wrong. Even this early in director Jason Reitman's career, I never imagined that he would make a film this bad. All his films so far (Thank You For Smoking, Up in the Air, Juno and Young Adult) have been sharply observed, funny and cynical looks at American culture. Adapting Joyce Maynard's novel takes Reitman into a new direction that he wasn't prepared for: an old fashioned weepie romance that never puts a foot right. In every scene Labor Day's overstretched story is unconvincing and overstated. Its situations are nothing but contrived and set against a backdrop of good old Americana it's hard to stomach that Reitman has recently given up on subversiveness and wit in favour of shallow gooeyness. The film's central idea is that a woman isn't missing a person but simply love. Kate Winslet features as a depressed single mother in the 1980s, who is divorced and seems almost catatonic. The main character in the story though is her young son Henry (Gattlin Griffith), who needs a father as much as his mother needs a husband. Their house is rundown and overgrown with weeds. He attempts to fill in the social void by taking his mother places. One day when they are shopping together Henry meets Frank (Josh Brolin), who is bleeding and asks for his help. Henry takes him back to his mother and they agree to let the man go home with them. From news reports, it is apparent that Frank is a murderer on the run from the law. He takes Henry and Adele hostage inside the house over the Labor Day weekend but can't leave till the right train arrives. Rather than hurting them he teaches the boy skills around the house and begins a romance with Adele that lasts beyond their five days together. Through flashbacks we learn that both Adele and Frank suffered tragedies in their own families. The premise is absurd. The credibility of the narrative hinges dangerously on the first scene where Adele and Henry meet Frank and the behavioural and psychological contrivances that Reitman employs to justify taking a stranger home are straight up implausible. On top of the brittle foundations of the characters, there is too little story and narrative direction. It shuffles between dull montages of Americanisms like playing baseball, fixing tires and baking pies. These scenes are wholesome, clean and frankly, boring. To compensate for the lack of conflict, there are least three set pieces where Reitman amateurishly tries to manufacture suspense by having neighbours and police visit the house. Not one of these episodes rings true. The lowest point of the film involves the introduction of a handicapped child. I found the cheap and artificial way that someone's disability is used to try and build tension to be nothing short of offensive.The source material isn't strictly to blame. On top of producing and directing the film, Reitman also wrote the screenplay. He makes fatal decisions in the writing, like assuming his audience is unintelligent. One of the script's few potential sources of conflict is having the adults ask Henry to leave the house for errands, presumably so they can sleep together. In the very next scene another child character is brought in solely to explain that very same idea. As she explains that they might leave without him, the film cuts back to a scene of Adele and Frank in the car together. Typifying the same annoying over-explaining is also an intrusive voice over (supplied by Tobey Maguire as the adult Henry) and loud music cues. An example is when Frank suggests the police won't be suspicious if they drive away pretending to be a family, the voice over chimes in straight after to say ""a family"", further telegraphing the emotion and sentimentality. Kate Winslet's performance is one of the film's only qualities. Though short on dialogue, the physically drained look on her face feels true to the depressive state of her character. Yet Josh Brolin is miscast as a romantic lead and fails to show anything more than a simple brood. The decisions of their characters, like planning to move away together, seem inexplicable in such a short time span of knowing each other. As Henry, Gattlin Griffith lacks contrast and variation in his expressions. I wanted his character to have a stronger reaction to having this strange, bloody man staying in their house. Where can the story go if everyone is all too happy to go along with this? I've liked all of Jason Reitman's films until now but this was a long, frustrating film, particularly when it postures as being a story about truth and perspective but has few of these qualities. Hopefully this terrible film is a small blight on what should be an otherwise fruitful career for the director.",Labor Day
52,Christian_Dimartino,A laugh riot,4,2 May 2014,"I told myself that I would only write reviews for movies that I see in theatres from here on out. But I suppose exceptions can be made. I'm making that exception for Jason Reitman's Labor Day. When a good director makes a bad movie, you feel it. You feel the artist behind the camera desperately try to make art out of garbage, and typically the end result is regret. Regret of an opportunity wasted. Labor Day is one of those cases.Jason Reitman seemed to be on such a role. I loved his first four movies (Thank You for Smoking, Juno, Up in the Air, and Young Adult), and had hope that he could continue his winning streak with Labor Day, the first straight ""drama"" he has made yet. Sadly, the final result is the most outrageous movie to be released in quite some time. It's a self-serious drama that begs you to buy into its romance. Hell no.Oscar Winner Kate Winslet magically earned a Golden Globe nomination here for her role as Adele, a slightly depressed divorced shut in who lives with her emotionless son Henry (Gattlin Griffith). On Labor Day weekend, the two take a rare trip to the grocery store, where they meet Frank (Josh Brolin), an injured man who asks them to take him to their house.Soon, they discover that Frank is an escaped convict who served many years for murder. Are they scared of him? No, not really. Griffith doesn't really show emotion here. He mainly just reads off of a teleprompter. Anyways, soon, Frank ties Adele up. Then what does he do? Brace yourself, it's crazy: he cooks a bowl of chili. Adele and Henry just happened to be held hostage by the gentlest murderer of all time.Soon, they make a peach pie. Then, Frank plays baseball with Henry. Then, Frank and Adele become lovers... all within five days. They become so madly in love that they discuss leaving the country together as a family. Do you see where I'm going with this? While I watched this movie, I constantly asked myself if what was happening was actually happening. It's a love story so ludicrous I can't believe Winslet didn't chuck it out the window the second she read it.Reitman has said that the novel moved him to tears. Unless the novel took place in a year, then there's no way that's possible. I didn't buy it. There is plenty of talent on display here. Brolin and Winslet are watchable in anything, but Labor Day is pushing it. Instead of being moved by the romance, I was moved to laughter. I laughed and laughed at the plot inconveniences, and just how hard Reitman tried to make a compelling movie. I needed a drink afterwards, and I'm not talking about soda.C-",Labor Day

The revelation was that in the process both sides took chances to trust the other and seemed to paid off.Whilst it makes for an unusual experience, I struggled to come to terms with the unfolding of the story in terms of how one could get hold of two other people against their will in an apparently easy development.

55,ClaytonDavis,'Labor Day' is Mature But Narratively Thin,5,26 December 2013,"Over the past few years, Academy Award nominee Jason Reitman has shown great promise of what is to be a fine career for the director. With films like Thank You for Smoking, Juno, and Up in the Air, he hasn't made an obvious misstep in his filmmaking...until now. His newest film Labor Day, based on the book by Joyce Maynard, has the filmmaker venturing off into TV movie territory inhabited by full-fledged melodrama that is both over the top and disengaging.The film stars Academy Award winner Kate Winslet as Adele, a depressed single mother, who along with her son Henry (played by the young Gattlin Griffith), is held captive in their home by an escaped convict named Frank (played by Josh Brolin). While time passes in their home, Frank takes an active and surprising role in the broken family's life. Narrative mistakes aside, this is one of Reitman's most polished and beautiful looking film that he has produced. Cinematographer Eric Steelberg uses the house of Adele and Henry has a secondary character, letting the sunlight of 1987 peek into the home and shine subtlety onto our lead actors. With the shots where you can see the dust floating near the arm of the couch, Labor Day executes a stylistic filmmaking gesture that Reitman's career desperately needed. While competency is appreciated from a movie watcher, to be considered one of the greats, one must have signature technique. Martin Scorsese, Terrence Malick, Steven Spielberg, all acclaimed directors with a legion of followers who have changed the game for cinema forever. Not expecting Jason Reitman's name to be synonymous with those directors but one must strive to create a medium of their own. In the end, Reitman leaves the pot on the stove too long with everything feeling over thought and unbelievable. As something we've come to expect, the performances displayed are all impressive. Kate Winslet continues to find new realms for herself to execute her outstanding abilities. Winslet's work as Adele is one of her finest performances yet, showcasing a new vulnerable aspect she hasn't shown before. Adele's broken demeanor, as she fears leaving her home and relying solely on her young son for comfort, is on full display ringing an authentic emotional response. Loneliness is her soul mate and though her character's reactions to certain plot points ring false, I blame the script's glaring omissions of true human behavior that wear her down.Josh Brolin's reserved and quiet demeanor allow him to weigh down the overly dramatic tale but ultimately brings nothing of substance to sustain a successful conclusion. Frank's will and mysterious ticks are intriguing at first but that only works when you have a solid foundation in your story to warrant that type of behavior. Unfortunately the film doesn't possesses any of that. The most impressive aspect of the film is the young and masterful Gattlin Griffith, one of the year's best young actor performances. As the curious and reclusive Henry, Griffith explores a composure that not many young performers starting out can obtain. One of the skillful features that Reitman demonstrates, both in narrative and directing, is keeping Henry on the outside looking in. When Frank and Adele speak of things that would be too much for a child to understand, Reitman chooses to keep us looking in from the child's perspective. Whispers and glances into mother's bedroom or a stealthily look into the backyard are brilliant choices he makes. Overall Labor Day demonstrates both a step forward and a back for Jason Reitman. If anything, it shows what he can do if he infuses this new found strong directorial style with a more complex and capable script and story, if he can get his hands on one.. It's a mature endeavor that though is incredibly uneven, makes me very excited for Reitman's future works including Men, Women, & Children due out in 2014.Read more at The Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com)",Labor Day
56,SumanShakya,A simple and predictable melodrama......,5,24 May 2014,"Just like two of his earlier films ""Up in the Air"" and ""Juno"", Jason Reitmann weaves a simple feel good melodrama. But this time the story is a bit predictable and flawed. The story involves an intrusion of a convict in a house where resides a single depressed mom and a son; and later the attachment developed between the trio. However, the affection built doesn't come very effectively in the film and lingers into a bit of a dragging drama that gradually loses the impact. To me the beginning and the last half an hour of the film was gripping powered by the winning performances from Kate Winslet and Josh Brolin. And the rest of the film seem to lose the interest due to the incoherent series of sequences given in the story. Despite this, the film deserves an applaud for the good performances from Kate Winslet (like the one she did in ""The Reader"") and Josh Brolin.Rating: 1.5 stars out of 4",Labor Day
57,shawneofthedead,"A peach of a cast, but the plot is the pits.",5,13 March 2014,"In 2005, Jason Reitman made his directorial debut with the breathlessly acerbic Thank You For Smoking - a dark, funny comedy laced with politics, satire and humanity. He's since produced several excellent films - Juno, Up In The Air and Young Adult - in the same cheeky, intelligent vein. That's why Labor Day - adapted by Reitman from Joyce Maynard's novel - comes as such a surprise. Stripped of his trademark snappy banter and over-the-top characters, the film is Reitman at his quietest and least showy. Unfortunately, it's also Reitman at his most melodramatic: his excellent cast of actors only just manage to help him drag the film back from the brink of cheesy soap opera.Adele (Kate Winslet) is a depressed, broken single mother suffering from agoraphobia. Shutting herself up at home with her precocious, dutiful son Henry (Gattlin Griffith), she ventures out to pick up food and clothes as infrequently as humanly possible. One fateful day, she and Henry encounter Frank (Josh Brolin), an escaped convict, in a department store. Wounded and desperate, Frank finds his way into their car - and, over the course of the Labor Day weekend - into their house and hearts.The resulting film is a curious blend of hasty romance and psychological drama, twisted around a plot that makes little emotional sense. How could someone as terrified of strangers and new situations as Adele find it within herself to so quickly trust a man she doesn't know at all - someone who disturbs the sanctity of her home, and threatens, however obliquely, the safety of her son? Sure, Frank is unfailingly kind, considerate and handy around the house, but he's also a criminal serving time for murder: a crime he doesn't even really talk about until considerably later in the film. Quite frankly, it's the kind of rushed, clumsy plotting and character work that you might expect in a soap opera - or, worse, a porn movie.What makes this ill-advised drama worth watching - despite its many problems - is its cast. Reitman has waxed lyrical about securing Winslet for the title role, and he's absolutely right to have been so overjoyed. She delivers a beautifully sensitive performance as Adele, making you want to believe that her character is a hopeless, wounded romantic rather than an unhinged, over-trusting madwoman. Brolin, too, lends Frank a soul and heart that the script occasionally denies him, while Griffith is wonderfully natural as a boy who begins to worry what it means when his mother finds happiness that's seemingly independent of his efforts and existence.Of course, there's another reason to watch Labor Day: the infamous scene in which Frank takes a bucket of peaches and teaches his hosts/hostages to make the perfect peach pie. The moment he guides Adele's hands into the pie batter is a moment that will either convince you that these two lonely hearts belong together, or that something has gone quite oddly wrong with the entire film. It's a dilemma that presents itself at many points during Labor Day, and one that rarely resolves itself in the way that Reitman clearly wants it to.",Labor Day

59,Figgy66-915-598470,A graceful film that draws you in,8,24 March 2014,"24 March 2014 Film of Choice at The Plaza Tonight - Labour Day. This is the tale of Adele (Kate Winslet) and her son Henry (Gattlin Griffith) and an escaped felon called Frank (Josh Brolin). Depressed and completely shut away from the world, Adele survives by relying on her son. Leaving the house only once a month to do their grocery shopping, it is on one of these trips that their world is turned upside down. Frank forces Adele to take him back to her house, where is wants to lay low whilst on the run. Slow to start, the film never really gathers much pace, there are a lot of silences but the gradual development of the relationships between the Mother, her son and the convict sucks you into the plot and you realise that all of a sudden you are rooting for the bad guy. A really moving performance from Kate Winslet, she really had me concerned for the well being of both son and mother and at times I was never really sure where the story was going to take us. Josh Brolin plays a brooding, ruggedly handsome bad guy who again didn't let you know where his story was going until the end of the film. A lovely film, I don't know if the story has ever been performed on the stage but I think it would make a great play.",Labor Day
60,herbqedi,Satisfying and involving if a bit slow at first,8,2 February 2014,"This was a satisfying movie that actually took me back to one of my favorite old TV movies, My Sweet Charlie, without the racial angle. The story is well-told and well-developed. Josh Brolin is excellent as always (outside the Coen-Brothers films where they are intent on casting him as a moron) playing the convicted murderer who is quite different than the public warnings would suggest. Kate Winslett never ceases to amaze me with her acting. This is right up there with her best work. Gattlin Griffith is very good as her son and Clark Gregg gives added dimension and insight with what ordinarily have been the thankless role of the ex-husband. J. K. Simmons appearance seems to be an obligatory cameo to keep Reitman's lucky streak going by casting him in all of Reitman's movies and Tobey Maguire's cameo seems even more perfunctory. The first quarter of the movie takes a bit too long to get things going and the narration abruptly cuts out midway through the film and then returns at the very end to complete the story in a breathless 30-second wrap-up. These are all minor quibbles in a romantic tale in 1970's New England, exquisitely photographed and woven taking you into the region and era with great skill One of the great all-time romances - not quite, but possibly in the top 200, still not bad.",Labor Day
61,mrcibubur,An unexpected but pleasant movie to watch,7,24 December 2014,"There is no doubt about the implausibility of a lonely depressed Mother and her Son being picked up by a man in a grocery store (hardly a supermarket)who turns out to be an escaped convict on the run.The fact is that the two characters both in terms of real time acting and in terms of the story line blended and bonded well in my personal view and there is nothing appropriate in trivialising a movie which reaches deep inside our hearts and brings more than a few tears to our eyes while watching it as they both seek to re-discover love and a righteous way to live their life.There are too many films made nowadays focused on action and violence riddled with bad language, perverseness and inappropriate sexuality.This film is well directed, the screenplay story is entirely logical in the circumstances, the acting does not disappoint and the ending of the film was well considered.I am not altogether sure of the implied reference to 'Labor Day' in the title and I was initially put off watching this film for a couple of months because I thought this might be some kind of 'Mum gets pregnant' cheesy love-story film. Not like that at all.I have questions as to who is the real Mother of Henry (Hank) given developments during the story and not having read the book and there is a hollowness to Frank's earlier part of the story with his girlfriend/wife. The same could be said about Adele and her relations with her former husband and what was the real cause of her depression.There are many issues about this film which merit open discussion but overall this is a super film and should be appreciated and enjoyed on merit.",Labor Day

63,tigerfish50,A Straw Dog on the run in Madison County,4,18 October 2013,"'Labor Day' begins in a broken American household. After his parents' divorce, a sensitive seventh-grader chooses to stay with his depressed mother rather than join his father's new family. Henry and Adele remain trapped in a sad, dysfunctional relationship as a child parenting a traumatized adult until they embark on a fateful shopping trip prior to a holiday weekend. They are accosted in a discount store by a threatening stranger, Frank, who demands they give him a ride in their car, and accompanies them to their dilapidated rural home. By the next morning it's apparent he's a dangerous escaped convict, and his departure has become impossible since a police dragnet has surrounded the area.After this disturbing first act, the film soon leaves 'Desperate Hours/Straw Dogs' territory in the rear view mirror and enters a sunlit world similar to 'The Bridges of Madison County'. Frank confounds pessimistic expectations by coaching Henry in baseball skills, doing various household odd-jobs, servicing the car and baking peach pies. Before too long he's also healing Adele's aching loneliness with his peachy massage techniques. Fine performances from the three lead actors hold the film together, but can't prevent the story's drift into sentimentality and implausibility. The epilogue stretches any remaining credulity beyond belief as it panders to the feel-good requirements of a rich box-office harvest.",Labor Day
64,cnycitylady,Not hard 'Labor' to get through this film,7,30 August 2014,"'Labor Day' is quite simply a good romance movie. There is no overly weepy women, no unbelievably charming and romantic men. This is not a Nicholas Sparks novel and it is not some campy Lifetime Movie. 'Labor Day' is a throwback to when romance was alive and sweet in the tenderest and most realistic way possible.The characters may each be a little touched in the head in their own unique ways, but it is very clear that they all love and need each other. The tension builds as this escaped convict (Brolin) spends the week with a single woman (Winslet) and her son (Griffith) and you're not sure whether you should trust him; whether or not he's taking advantage or whether or not this woman is sane enough to make this decision. You don't know if you want him caught or set free, but it is out of concern for the well being of all involved that you feel this way. The only qualm I have with this movie is the fact that it is told from the boy's point of view. It takes away from your seeing Winslet and Brolin fall in love but it also adds the element of unease. So I guess there was a method to their madness.The movie is quiet as is natural for a romance but it feels as though you should be yelling at the screen. In the end though you get an old fashioned bittersweet love story that will put a smile on your face.",Labor Day
65,ligonlaw,What Was the Academy Thinking? Labor Day Was One of the Best,9,21 January 2014,"""Labor Day"" is one of the films that the Academy misses every year. Each year there are better films that are sidelined by lesser films that make the best picture list. ""Labor Day"" is one of errors made by the academy voters for 2013. There are four films on the Best Picture list I would scratch and replace with this one.The story takes place over a long Labor Day weekend. Kate Winslet plays Adele. a troubled, divorced mother who is probably clinically depressed. She lives with her son Henry, played by Dylan Minnette at 16, and Toby McGuire as a young man. Henry is the narrator of the story as his older self, Toby McGuire. The cutting edge of this drama is played by Josh Brolin, who is an escaped prisoner serving a sentence for murder. Brolin's Frank creates a large mixed bag of emotions. He is scary, dangerous, kind, romantic, tender, calm, thoughtful, desperate and talented. In the beginning, Frank takes the family hostage, but Henry and Adele fall in love with their captor. He is a man's man. He repairs things around the house. He knows how to repair the car, wash and wax the floors, and replace lights. And he can cook. He ties Adele up. Then he feeds her tenderly a dish he has prepared for her which is delicious.He teaches Henry how to throw a baseball and how to swing a baseball bat. The role of Frank is a great role for an actor, and Brolin is perfect in it. This was an Oscar-worthy performance that the academy missed. There is no sex on screen but the film bakes in the heat of pent-up sexuality. Adele and Frank are on fire for each other, and there is a odd and funny connection between Henry and a young girl. Even though the academy missed it, you should not. It is one of the best films for 2013.",Labor Day

69,byson5186,"Slow, But Entertaining",10,5 January 2015,"I just finished watching this movie after renting it from RedBox, and this was a great movie. Definitely one that will make you feel really good. Let me talk about what makes this movie great. The plot of this movie that we are familiar with of Adele played by Kate Winslet and her 13-year old son Henry, played by Gattlin Griffith hiding an escaped convict, Frank played by Josh Brolin from authorities, and seeing him for who he is. That sounds like a plot that we'd see on Soap Operas. But, watching this movie does not look like tuning into television for a Soap Opera because it doesn't have that kind of mood. What else is great from this movie, the movie takes place in the '80s, 1987 a time a lot of us wish to go back to even if we weren't born back then considering life to have been more simple then. A lot of this movie is told from Henry's point of view. He's a good kid and likable character, and it shows some of his emotions which are typical of boys his age. This movie also takes place in a rural area. That being said, as rural areas are typically quiet this movie is mostly quiet with slow background music, and slow scenes such as characters walking. But, that being said the movie was great because slow scenes can sometimes make a movie boring or realistic. I felt like this movie was slow, but not boring and definitely realistic. The characters we meet in this movie also seem like realistic people, like your everyday type of people. The plot from this movie also seems realistic, and it does not show scenes that seem like they wouldn't or couldn't happen.Sometimes, it's nice to watch movies that seem like real life, even if the story might be fiction. Movies with relatable and believable characters, as we can connect more if the characters seem relatable. Also, we might be used to a lot of special effects nowadays, or fun fictitious plots which there's nothing wrong about that. But, sometimes it's nice to watch a movie where they don't go all out to film it, without so many special effects, and without a plot or action that only seems to happen in movies. Sometimes a person can think small if they want a good movie, not needing an extremely expensive budget and countless special effects to make a successful movie. They can make an entertaining movie and even show characters that seem like your everyday people. I felt like Henry made this movie very likable. Also, if you are not sure about the plot of the movie, minus an ex convict staying at somebody's house, you will not be too sure what to expect as the slowness of the movie makes the scenes less predictable. I really wasn't sure what to expect. You expect something, but you ask yourself when will it happen and will it happen?If you're up for an easy movie, and a love story then this movie definitely is for you. It will show typical life, and make it seem so happy. I give this movie a 10/10, because I felt like it was really well done, especially for a simple movie.",Labor Day

So I thought to myself if they are involved in this film it must be a masterpiece and I would not miss it for the world. But I forgot one thing. No matter how great an actor is, their job is to bring the directors vision to life, and this director's vision would have been better off left in the dark.So you meet an escape felon and have no idea why he was in prison, but the very next day he's changing the oil in your station wagon and laying bricks on your steps and moping and waxing your floors? WTF? Then the next day he's teaching you how to bake a peach pie from scratch, then showing your son how to pitch a baseball? And in the span of 3 days you decide to pack up shop and leave the country with him? Sounds a little far-fetched right? It would have been a lot more believable if the director had put it together well.Then the irrelevant side story of the son with the goth girl who was clearly from the 90's with her dingy stringy hair and heavy eye liner.

It seems all to convenient that although Brolin is on the run from the law, he can still hang around in the driveway to fix the car or play baseball outside. With a book, the characters could feel a bit more fleshed out, rather than them just doing random perfect family activities.

Other times, it is not drama of any quality, but you still enjoy yourself, perhaps immensely--say Airplane, Godzilla vs Mothra, or Rocky III.Fundamentally, Labor Day is a chick flick of the second category. Josh Brolin plays Frank, a man on the run for double murder who escaped prison by jumping from a second floor window. Limping into a K-Mart, he is spying single mom Adele (Kate Winslet) someone who he thinks he can talk into helping him. Adele's 13-year-old son Henry starts chatting with Frank, and seems to think it would be okay to offer this man bleeding in a K-mart a ride to... somewhere.Let me stop here. This movie is already off the rails. There is NO CHANCE this would ever happen, and yet... time for Godzilla!! We suspend our disbelief, and it gets better. They take Frank home and he starts doing household chores while hiding out from the police-- landscapes the yard, changes the oil in the car, even bakes a peach pie. He turns out to be a great guy, and the lonely, tormented Adele falls for him, offering her a chance for love again.At this point, you would think it would be lights out, but--yo! Adrian!--something about this movie keeps you around. The actors are good, really good, and they play it with as much conviction as if they were doing Hamlet (well, maybe not quite that much). The characters emerge, and you can sympathize with them, root for them and believe in them. You might even start to think that love might cause something this implausible, since, after all, we all have our own stories. It is both half-baked and absorbing.Critical response has been hot and cold--easy to understand given the contradictions.

And lastly, I should just accept that a murderer on the run would spend time outside in broad daylight performing chores for the captive family when the neighborhood is swarming with police searching for him.Other than those flaws, the movie is quite well done, with good acting performances all- around, good story pacing, and a script detailed enough to build three dimensional characters outside of the main story.Just because I am a sucker for romance, I will recommend this movie (with the above reservations) to fellow romance-seekers.",Labor Day

Besides, Josh Brolin's character is too much of a Christ figure. He seems to save everyone who comes into contact with him. But, despite all his positive qualities, he is ultimately crucified, disappears, and then is resurrected. And can romance really survive such an ordeal? Yet, putting cynicism aside, I have to say that I found the film enjoyable and even inspiring. The acting was good throughout. Normally, I have an aversion to child actors. They are either irritatingly cute or smart-mouthed. However, I must say that Gattlin Griffith did not produce this reaction in me. I think he played it pretty straight and was quite believable. Kate Winslet seems to have an affinity for these psychologically-damaged women roles and pulls it off as usual. Josh Brolin is steady.At some point in any film, you have to suspend what you know about the real world, the evils of life, and the conniving ways of the people in it and trust in the possibility that there may be some good left in this battered world.

78,kiowhatta,Authentic character drama,8,29 April 2020,"This film offers an engaging, warm and enchanting backdrop for the story to unfold.
This is not about high drama, police chases and a fugitive on the run - though this does serve to show real themes of human frailty, tragedy, loneliness, opportunities lost, love lost, and a coming of age story for the young son from which the perspective and occasional narration flow.
Both Brolins and Winslets characters share a similar past: one of betrayal, disappointment, trauma - which leads to both experiencing forms of imprisonment; Brolins is actual resulting from a momentary crime of passion; Winslets from suffering multiple miscarriages leaving her psychologically and emotionally debilitated.
Both also share losing a child.
All three are bought together as a result of Brolin needing to seek refuge, and this is the unlikely circumstance that leads to the three forming a strong bond, whilst the son has doubts which are strangely delivered by an obviously mysterious, perverse and precocious young teen girl.
They all decide to risk absconding with a plan to start over, but, as often happens in life, life conspires to dash the hopes of the struggling though that is not the end.

Great performances all the way around. The plausibility of a woman falling so fast and hard for this guy is a bit of stretch. Also, the dragnet in the neighborhood seems a bit of an overkill, since you would guess the police would be more inclined that the escapee high tailed it out of the area. And then the 25 year wait after just 5 days...well, I am a romantic, so I sat through it and did enjoy the ending, sometimes you just want a happy ending.

81,anthony-727,Yes but...,6,22 December 2013,"The first thing I will say is... It is beautifully shot every image is well thought out... so much so that each image lasts a lifetime. The film rambles and rambles and though it has a decent enough story at it's heart and is supported by some very good performances, it is another film that could do with at least 15 minutes cutting out.Josh Brolin is the lynch pin (for me) of the film, his gravitas keeps a lid on it being too sentimental. The script is okay too but it is simply drawn out when they are packing up to leave, the damn thing goes on for about 2 minutes... I got it after 10 seconds.Also this man has made a break from prison and when it starts reaching a point to get it together before he gets caught - well guess what. Then they tie the whole ting up in about five minutes.The flash backs are vague and it seems that what the director wants us to be concerned with is the emotion - so as to the fathers reasons for leaving or his reason for being imprisoned - it's all there but it's all vague and left that way in favor of the quivering emotionality of the relationships - this could have been an excellent movie but misses for me. Josh Borlin though - he's the man!",Labor Day
82,thenekassyni,Good sentimental movie,8,17 April 2014,"This movie benefits from good actors and a well thought out script. The movie starts off rough as the man takes hostages but the script slowly works it way to explain his life and his time in jail. The controversial part of the movie, as I can see from some of the reviews here, is that he begins start his life anew with the mom and son. I am not sure what some reviewers would want to see rather than this transition as the story is carefully and methodically explained to them about his past life. So it only begs the question why would he act any different because he isn't really a criminal to begin with. Odd remarks by reviewers to be honest. People just don't pay enough attention to the details.The movie does, however, remind me of Bridges of Madison County. The mood, setting and music lends itself to that similarity, one that I don't mind at all. If anything I recommend the movie for the good actors in the movie. I am surprised I missed the movie when it came out. Enjoy.",Labor Day

Superior acting by Kate Winslet, Josh Brolin and young Gattlin Griffith, this is a story with multi- layered depth and haunting flashbacks through dreams ... some viewers might become impatient as the various dream scenes flicker across the movie screen. Just wait, it's all done with amazing dramatic effect, and when the dream scape finally reveals itself, you'll be impressed with the final story.More importantly, ""Labor Day"" displays the under utilized message of the impact of relationships, even though the positive results are revealed many years later.The soundtrack is unusual and haunting, providing a surreal effect on the entire production.",Labor Day

The book is very good and packs an emotional wallop at the end (a similar ending with some added nuances). Having read the book, I knew what was going to happen so in some ways it took away any of the suspense that existed in the film for people who were seeing the story for the first time.I think the book fills in the details of the characters' lives better than the film does, however the director obviously had to choose how to provide the background stories of Adele and Frank, and given their individual pasts, it wasn't an easy feat. The director did an admirable job in my opinion, yet I don't know if I hadn't read the book if I'd have been able to piece together Frank's story all that well.The casting of Kate Winslet and Josh Brolin was very inspired and they each captured their characters believably.

Brolin is perfectly typecast as the dangerous, masculine, ultimately relatively gentle and loving mail lead.The best thing about this movie is that there are two best things about the movie, it perfectly sets the time and place, small town 1980s when the world was a little simpler, but still far from perfect, and the look and tone is almost dreamy throughout the picture.The other best thing about the movie is that it is more than the usual bad guy meat good women and improbable love story follows, how the son interplays with the story becomes and major theme, and has a major influence on the outcome of the story, Kate Winslet's character obviously has issues, and they slowly unfold and her character is developed with the somewhat unique aspect that it is mostly as seen by her perceptive and sensitive adolescent son. Brolin's character is complex as well, obviously not a cold hearted violent man, but you are also never quite sure if there isn't a little something below the surface ready to flare up under the proper circumstances.I also liked that it both did and didn't embrace the Hollywood against all odds happily ever after ending, watch the show to find out how.",Labor Day
86,pinkybanana2000,Nothing rescues this movie (SPOILERS),2,2 January 2015,"This is a very bad movie. From the conception to the execution, it is a bad idea. First, the conception. A divorced mother living with her pre-teen son accosts an escaped prisoner in the supermarket. Even the progress of that scene was too clumsy. The prisoner merely summons the boy, talks him into accompanying him. And, on the way, he steals a jacket and a baseball cap. We are not told whether there is anything in the boy's past that makes him susceptible to this kind of blatant manipulation. It seems to me that he could have simply walked back to his mother, or screamed. It was during the day. There were several shoppers. I presume the store has some security apparatus in place.Then, the mother as the equally naive, but unwitting accomplice. Despite being within earshot of several shoppers, the mother then decides it is a good idea to let this stranger ride with them to their house. Whatever hesitation she had was so tepid, it was barely noticeable. Then, the-I-can't-believe-they-are-trying-to-make-a-romantic-movie- out-of-this chain of events. Predictably, this hunky escaped murderer turns to be quite handy. He can fix cars, he can do things around the house. Heck, he even knows how to cook. At no time did anyone of the other two decide, ""hmmm...this is not a good idea. We don't know this guy."" Things reach absurd levels of incredulity before the boy wises up, albeit prompted by a smart, but potty-mouthed girl of approximately the same age, and he contacts his estranged father who calls the police. Thereafter, the fugitive is arrested.Oh, but they fall in love in the meantime. Don't tell me you didn't see that coming. And, at the end we learn that upon release, after spending more than a decade in jail, she was still waiting for him. Okay, whatever. Why I hate this movie, apart from the rather pretentious plot and bad execution is the message: that a divorced woman with her young child should take in an escaped murderer in the off-chance that they might fall in love. It makes you shudder at the concept. Please, ladies, do not do this.",Labor Day

I am still undecided whether it was a good or a not so good pick but I think that's the theme that this movie carries overall. A young boy who's trying to make through life living with his single mother and a sudden inception of an escaped convict in their world. The movie does well to justify Frank's (the convict played by Josh Brolin) act and I'm glad they did not portray him as someone who was wrongfully accused. The acting is decent from everyone including Kate Winslet and his son portrayed by Gattlin Griffith. The script is good but not great and the ending is apt. It's one of those movies that will leave you teary. Some really touching scenes and acted well indeed, specially the part where Frank teaches them small joys in life like playing baseball and making a peach pie.",Labor Day

It is unrealistic. However, it is truly stunning. I won't say anything to spoil it for anybody other than stating how much you HAVE to go and watch it.

90,mokhatib,a great tragic love story,8,25 February 2016,"A single mom Adele (Winslet) with son Henry are forced to harbor a fugitive Frank (Brolin) at theirown home. An unexpected relationship develops among the three. A beautiful story with a great cast including the super talented Gattlin Griffith as Henry. A very sensual, delicate, and rather natural direction on the hands of Jason Reitman (Up in the Air, Juno). Jason scripted this movie based on the novel by Joyce Maynard. Jason did a terrific job in interpreting Adele's yearning for male attention and care, in brief a man around the house in every aspect, especially in the scene where Frank wraps his arm around her waist and when we see her face turning towards him, I and I am sure a lot of the audience expected a kiss but what do you knowWinslet beautifully and vulnerably lays her face on his shoulder.. absolutely mesmerizing!Another scene stands out for me how Reitman plays down and tones down the sexual relationship between Frank and Adele by suggestive scenes for example, when Henry does not find Frank on the couch where he was usually sleeps but hears him in his mom's bedroom and another scene where he opens the bathroom door to find her brushing her teeth with her under gown on with Frank there with her, but then in the movie's most vulnerable scene, we just get a single passionate kiss between Frank and Adele. I loved the use of sunlight throughout the movie right about when Frank arrives at Adel and Henry's house and starts affecting and impacting their lives, which to me is rather symbolic for light of hope that is shed on them, a second chance for a normal and loving family life, for them and for Frank as well, clearly evident in the final scenes when upon telling him about her problematic pregnancy life , she tells him:"" I can't give you a family."", he replies: "" you have"". I loved the clash of two unfortunate characters who lost love and regained it under the most unfortunate circumstances and their love conquered and endured all times and survived. You got to give praise to how Reitman in script and direction, sprinkled more than four dramatic tension points that could result in the capture of Frank, Henry's rebel girlfriend, Henry's letter to his Dad and mentioning at dinner that there is a man around his house, Bary the mentally handicapped kid who visits them and meets Frank, but the wow factor, is how all these did not play any part in Frank's final capture. Turning my attention to the script and as much as I loved it, a few things bothered me and caughtmy attention as weak and incredible as far as plot and characterization. Starting with Bary's visit and Frank's okay with that, how could a character like Frank who was cold and cautious from the beginning in order to protect himself, let a mentally retarded kid see him? What did he think it was okay? What was he going to say? He turned out rather shouting his name, how contradictory is that? Add to that, Reitman making Bary conveniently watch the news broadcast where for maybe the 20th time they show Frank's young prison pic and for the first time in the movie, they put an adult pic of him next to it, come on how convenient and corny is that? Also keeping with Frank's character motif , why would someone like him on the day he was all alone in the house and knowing from before that Adele's neighbors and friends barge in and pop in unexpectedly not to mention rudely like Bary's mom, and while standing conveniently in direct vision of anyone coming through the main door, leave it unlocked??? Hehe.. Of all the days they could have gathered their stuff and escape to Canada, they picked Henry's first day of school to do it, and where everybody in the movie made a point of it, that's just silly. Obviously it was added to create dramatic tension and suspense but to a weak effect and result. I will end my comments with the corny ending of the movie, we understand that Frank takes a lot of thecredit for the fine upbringing and how a fine man Henry turned out to be, but it was rather commercialand clichéd for Reitman to actually show us Henry doing exactly the same things Frank taught him, changing a tire while with his girlfriend, cooking and baking a pie for his mom, playing baseball etc and the corniest of them all, Henry becoming a pie chef and opening a famous restaurant, that ending was just too hollywoody and I imagine every scene that comes after Frank's second arrest is rather made for commercial box office reasons, come on would you rather have this ending or just maybe see Henry cooking for his mom, and being with his girlfriend? I know your pick.",Labor Day
91,ekenaudra,It was an OK...,7,11 February 2014,"Watched this for date night, of course I picked and my poor husband had no say. But he didn't put up much of a fuss. Like many others I thought the movie evoked emotions more than told a plot line. The best thing for me about the movie was the performances of Brolin and Winslet and how natural and real the time and setting was. It's based in 1987, but it wasn't dripping in cliché 80's memorabilia. The things I did have a problem with was the overtly sexual undertones that some how seemed misplaced in the storyline. Like when he tied her to the chair then feed her chili moments after he ""kidnapped her and her son"" .. Or when a neighbor came over with a bucket of ripe peaches and they made a pie... Literally I thought I was watching a cooking show but a very sensual cooking show... I get it that some ""foodies"" think food is sexy, but I'm not one of them, so that scene was uncomfortable for that reason; but also uncomfortable for the reason that the son was also involved in the pie making scene which brings me to my next complaint. At night when Brolin's and Winslet's characters were obviously getting hot and heavy in the next room it was weird to see the son laying in bed obviously fighting with his new found budding sexuality my husband commented on how he thought the character would ""whip it out and go to town"" while listening to his mom's moans in the next room... So for me that was weird and uncomfortable. I think it could have been a better movie if the sexuality seemed more natural at moments and less incestuous at other moments.",Labor Day
92,sherineyousery,A piece of art: Unconditional love and other matters of the heart ..,9,6 July 2014,"What a wonderful movie .. After watching too many movies, I learnt something very important: the rarest and most beautiful of movies are usually -but not always- unappreciated. Some movies become classics and I have no idea why, and others are simply overlooked when they have great things to teach ..I have too much to say about this masterpiece, but here's a few points to try to sum up:1- Judgment, we oven tend to judge without ever having a good thought or a tender approach. We do not care to listen to the story, we just condemn. This movie puts you right there, in an extraordinary unfamiliar situation you would normally judge and condemn anyone in, and tells you, ""Deal with it"" ..2- Unconditional love. Too rare in the real world, too rare you'll see a human being loving another with all the demons inside. This is so unfortunate, for unconditional love usually opens the door for us to view the world in a completely different light and perception. What was extraordinary about this movie, is that it showed two types of unconditional love, one romantic and the other parental.3- Good parenting doesn't mean transforming into a policeman, or choosing what your child should have as a hobby. True parenting means loving your child as he/she is, and most importantly, taking the time to live together. You share a life, you should not just preach about what's right and what's wrong, and I wished people would appreciate how a relationship like this is formed .. So beautifully portrayed when the mother took the time to teach her son about sex, not the bodily fluids and functions, as she says, but rather the feeling .. or when her son takes the time to make her breakfast in bed, rather than the father who just cares his son would not join a dance group so his peers wouldn't think he's gay.4- True love is something we should value as much as our own lives. And you get a lot more from life when you know what your priorities are. Also, true love doesn't ""develop"" in weeks or months, sometimes it takes an eye-contact. Decades of living together or hardships do not make for two lovers, it makes for two ""partners"".5- Beautiful people come in all sorts of form, and I usually view the most beautiful as the ones who've learnt the most from their pain, the most forgiving and the most ""open-hearted"" before ""open-minded"" .. Just pay a little more attention to what the father tells his son at the end of the movie about his ex-wife and you'll ""feel"" what I am talking about.6- The movie was realistic, it didn't just alter the ending to fit or to have more of a ""feel-good"" garbage effect. With some exceptions as leaving the door unlocked sometimes, or all three of them playing outside, I consider the movie didn't lose its grip on reality.Overall, this movie had some elements from ""The bridges of Madison county"" and others from ""Mud"", but still stands on its own as something different, interesting and thought-provoking. The flash-backs to both of their histories didn't matter to me much, because this is basically about unconditional love, so I appreciated the moment when Frank opens the album and sees her pregnant photo but doesn't ask, much more. I recommend it to anyone who wants to learn about redemption, unconditional love, relationships of many types and what hunger for love and human contact means. Not recommended at all if you didn't enjoy ""The bridges of Madison county"" and the kind of adult realistic Meryl Streep- drama movies. Very well acted, adapted and directed, I didn't have a dull moment, and the clichés were minimal.",Labor Day

94,nbthalia,A very good movie,8,9 March 2016,"Although this film is in many ways excellent both from acting and cinematography, it relies quite heavily on a few improbabilities that initially do not distract from your enjoyment. In retrospect however you can't help thinking, woah how did that happen? An escaped ex-con accosts a woman and gently but firmly persuades her and her young son to conceal them in her home, to which she agrees, though somewhat reluctantly. Unlikely? Of course it is, but this is a story after all. We are expected to believe that her loneliness and depression override her common sense. Possible, I suppose, I am no psychologist. Gradually the pair begin a relationship. Turns out this guy although an ex-con, is a real nice guy, does helpful jobs around the house, becomes a father figure to her little boy and even shines in bed. He is, in fact the man of her dreams. Of course, the law eventually catches up with him after various peripheral characters, plus an infuriatingly nosey cop, put two and two together. Result: Mister Nice Guy is banged up for another long stretch in the pen. The final rather unlikely situation: The woman waits for an eternity for his sentence to end and they are reunited in a sentimental final scene. And guess what? He is even more handsome and rugged-looking than he was before, despite being many years older. So, yes a very good and involving film, despite these minor cracks, rather than holes, in the plot.",Labor Day

Having said this, let me say a little about this movie. The movie plays very nicely with fear and tension. Any moment we expect something very terrible to happen. Murder, betrayal, rape, you name it.

100,LetwitJr,A new kind of film from Reitman,8,10 September 2013,"I attended the premiere of Labor Day at the Toronto International Film Festival. Most people walked in expecting a Juno/Up in the Air style comedy and if that's what you expect you'll be mildly surprised. The film is darker that Reitman's usual works though you still recognize the director's touch. The movie tells the story of Adele (Kate Winslet), a woman who slowly shut herself off from the world, relying heavily on her young son Henry (Gattlin Griffith), whose father abandoned them to another wife and other children. Enters a menacing escaped convict (Josh Brolin) who finds refuge with Adele and her son as he tries to remain hidden from the police. The summary will have you believe that 'the mother and son gradually learn his true story as their options become increasingly limited.' or that the family realizes they're now prisoners in their own home which makes it sound like the movie is going to be some sort of Panic Room 2 but the story is nothing like that. As Adele and her son get to know the prisoner, they both find the family they've been longing for. It's a beautiful story despite being somewhat implausible but I found what mattered wasn't the story we see, so much as witnessing the characters finally having a shot at happiness and how the remainder of their days is shaped by this weekend they spent together. This film isn't driven by dialogue as much as Reitman's other films were. The director has said in interviews that he found it challenging to do a movie where there was little dialogue (he actually said without music or dialogue and I walked in half expecting to see a silent film.) He worked around it by having Tobey Maguire narrate the film as an older Henry. The narration works though I think the film could have done without it as well. Don't let the whole 'silent' thing keep you from seeing this film, I found there was enough dialogue, and there is music as well though unlike Juno it doesn't play as a whole hipster soundtrack. The movie is more subtle yet more raw, slower than his usual films and it lets the actors take us through every emotion. Kate Winslet is a terrific actress and she gave a beautiful performance as Adele, very convincingly portraying a woman who's given up on living. Josh Brolin was great as well, giving us both a tough convict and a soft hearted man at times. Gattlin Griffith was great at a kid who grew up faster than he should. I'm always very iffy when it comes to child actors but he pulled it off very well. In conclusion, Labor Day is a different, more adult and more mature film from Jason Reitman. It's a nice transitions from his previous comedies and goes a bit deeper than his other films, bringing tension, tears and some laughs. Whether you're already a Reitman fan or not, I recommend this film, you'll be pleasantly surprised.",Labor Day
101,jdj2122,Much better than I expected,9,15 September 2013,"The movie Labor Day stars Kate Winslet, Gattlin Griffith, and Josh Brolin. When I saw this film yesterday, I was lucky enough to have the director, Jason Reitman, get up on stage and introduce the movie. He made it clear that this film was not a comedy, but a romantic drama that he made with tons of passion. For what it is, I think the film is amazing. I will warn you, this is a film was made for women, but guys can appreciate it too.So this movie was fun to watch. There was a lot of tension, and the actors did a good job of making even the unbelievable situations seem natural. There was a mystery that unfolded over the course of the movie, and the film was able to create real emotion and genuine shock from the audience. There is also great cinematography, nice subplots, and a final quarter that keeps you guessing. I'm not exaggerating any of this, so seriously ignore the critics and give this film a chance.The main thing that is wrong with the film is a certain level of disbelief, but it doesn't require more suspension of disbelief than any of the big blockbuster movies. It could also get cheesy and a little uncomfortable to watch at times, but it is still a great movie. i hope Jason Reitman continues to make great movies, as he has not made a single misstep in his career yet.This is a good movie to take a girl to on a date, and I'm sure you both could enjoy it. It is a little like a Nicolas Sparks book except with Oscar level acting, directing, cinematography, and screen writing, so if that sounds like your kind of thing, I highly recommend this movie, and reward it with an 8.7/10 stars.",Labor Day

It was like watching paint dry. I've not felt this way about a film since Butterfly and the Diving Bell. While for the most part the performances were fine, I felt the premise was implausible, highly contrived and full of holes to the point of being distracting and laughable.

Love leads us places where we don't expect to appear. This movie was about it. Dramas like this is not often we see. For everyone who likes slow-motion movies and wants to experience love, should watch it. Kate Winslet and Josh Brolin were brilliant as ever! Surprisingly we also see Tobey Maguire in the film too. As a conclusion I wanna say that this was one of the recent movies worth to give it a shot. I hope we'll see dramas like this again in near future. Thank you Mr. Reinar! Beautiful! Loved it!",Labor Day
108,mikerapuano,"A surprising film from Jason Reitman, but not a disappointing one.",8,1 February 2014,"Labor Day stars Gattlin Griffith, Kate Winslet, Josh Brolin, and the voice of Nick Carraway. The film is the latest by writer/director Jason Reitman, who, for my money, has never turned out a truly unsatisfactory movie. Labor Day is no exception.Now there are a few flaws with the movie. When going to see Labor Day one needs to bring a very generous portion of ""suspension of disbelief"". Mainly the plot setup itself, the relationship between Adele and Frank (Kate Winslet & Josh Brolin) is more than a little far fetched. The logic behind their eventual infatuation with each other is the idea that they are both wounded by their past relationships, but to be honest, it isn't handled very well. Very quickly after an escaped convict starts passively aggressively threatening her, she wraps her hands around his as they prepare a peach pie in a particularly ridiculous sequence that is referenced a few times throughout the rest of the film. The beginning of the relationship is executed quickly and sloppily, rather than the slow burn that it should have been. There are several slightly unbelievable events throughout the movie, and it's often a little irritating early on in the film to try and play along.However, after the first act is out of the way, the film finds its feet. Once the main relationship has been established, the major threat of the film comes not from Frank, but the people hunting him. The reviews of Labor Day have hailed it as a perfect date movie. This is true, but rather than being a date movie in a romantic sense, this is a date movie in the same way as a horror/thriller movie. The movie deals less with romance and more with suspense than most trailers are emphasizing. The fact is, the romantic aspect is almost sidelined, and the main focus is on keeping the harboring of a fugitive a secret from the police and Adele's particularly nosy friends. The film features an array of extremely nail biting sequences in which Frank finds himself on the verge of being caught, that had me genuinely shaking. This is suspenseful in the same way that Argo was suspenseful, and that's an outstanding compliment.I think that negative reviews of this film are either a result of inaccurate expectations, or the slight implausibility of some of the plot. If you see Labor Day, understand that it is a film that deals with a romantic relationship, but even more so on the aspect of hiding a wanted fugitive in a suburban neighborhood. That being said, the film is beautifully shot and directed. The performances are universally excellent, with special emphasis on Kate Winslet. All in all, if your willing to play along with some of the more unbelievable aspects, Labor Day is a very entertaining and somewhat thrilling experience.",Labor Day
109,joshua-g-ochoa,Forget the silly plot and get swept away by an emotional experience.,9,1 February 2014,Labor Day is a fantastic emotional experience with great direction from Reitman who manages to lift a melodramatic source into a film of beauty. Easily Reitman's most mature work (though not his best) unfortunately people will be too turned off by the plot that they won't give the movie the chance it deserves. Fantastic performances from Brolin and Winslet and newcomer Gattlin Griffith. Great score and gorgeous cinematography; this film is beautifully crafted. Easily one of my favorites of 2013 and one I hope people embrace even with some of the silliness of the plot. Great film. It also makes me really hungry for some chili and peach pie!,Labor Day

112,musesboy,Jason Reitman is still batting a thousand,10,2 February 2014,"I was apprehensive attending the Saturday morning showing of Jason Reitman's Labor Day. Although I almost always avoid reviews and trailers when I am certain I will see a movie, I had heard the mostly negative buzz for Reitman's fifth movie. I also knew that this wouldn't contain the humor that I loved in Thank You for Smoking, Juno, Up in the Air and Young Adult. In short, I was afraid that Reitman's perfect record would be broken, but in my mind at least, he's still batting a thousand. If you're a Reitman fan, I urge you to stop reading until you have seen the movie. It's impossible to talk about it without giving away significant plot points.For those of you who are undecided, I'm not going to mention anything that isn't revealed in the trailer.Adele (Kate Winslet) plays a single mother who lives with her son, Henry (Gattlin Griffith). Her former husband had a child with another woman and Adele struggles to cope with depression and social anxiety. She barely leaves the house, shopping just once a month for supplies from the local store. It might be difficult to understand this condition if you have never suffered from it. Some days are good, and it's possible to talk to a total stranger; other days are difficult, and the slightest trigger can result in a surge of panic. This fight or flight feeling can be overwhelming, and, as a coping technique, those who suffer from anxiety run through every possible scenario before facing the world.You can imagine Adele's horror when Henry introduces her to Frank (Josh Brolin), who just met him in the store and asked for a ride. I can imagine Adele wondering how to extract herself from the situation without upsetting her son. Does Frank look safe, or could he turn out to be dangerous? Frank more or less insists that Adele help him, and then demands to be driven to her home. He's an escaped convict.This is not the Reitman that we have come to know and love. Make no mistake, Labor Day is a drama. It plays out somewhat like a Hitchcock movie, but instead of seeing things from the viewpoint of the man on the run, we see things through the eyes of Adele and Henry. Frank just wants to rest for a while and says that he will leave that night by train, but Labor Day weekend is approaching and the trains aren't running.The story is set in 1987, and the narration is handled by Tobey Maguire, who also shows up later in the story as an adult version of Henry. If you're planning to see this movie because Maguire is involved, his role is fairly minor. This is all about the interaction between Adele and Frank, and how it impacts Henry. The acting is superb, and Winslet thoroughly deserved her Golden Globe nomination.As the trailer shows, this film isn't a traditional crime drama. Adele has missed her husband and Frank doesn't seem all that threatening. The news bulletins say that he is a murderer serving 18 years, but he insists that things didn't happen the way they were described on TV. We eventually learn the truth through flashbacks, but I won't talk about that here. We are also shown more of Adele's past, and come to understand some of the things that trigger her anxiety. These troubled people find that they like each other, and both Adele and Henry seem content to have Frank around. Instead of treating them as prisoners, he even fixes things around the house.I found myself actually rooting for Frank to escape and it reminded me of Roger Ebert's comments about the scene in Psycho where we wanted the car to sink into the water when Norman Bates was hiding it. I keep mentioning Hitchcock because tension and suspense is present throughout the film. I think I was engrossed in the story for every single moment of the 111 minutes.So why are the reviews so negative? Is the story unrealistic? Not to me. Is the ending contrived or weak? I certainly didn't think so. I was never bored and the resolution wasn't immediately obvious. The actors didn't put a foot wrong either. Were people disappointed by the lack of Reitman's established formula? I really don't know why the reviews are so bad. I can assure you that I would echo those opinions if the same were true for me, but I loved Labor Day. The score was subtle and effective, the pacing good, and the atmosphere just right.The only difficult thing is deciding whether to give the film 4.5 or 5 stars, and I think it deserves a 5. If you like Reitman at all, please give this a chance and make up your own mind. I'm delighted that I did.",Labor Day
113,riceflan,unique and beautiful,10,29 August 2014,"I would say that ""Labor Day"" is an unusually sensitive and nuanced film. Not many will appreciate it, which makes it all the more enticing. It is not for the cynical, that's for sure. Very moving. Fabulous sound-score and photography, as well as directing. Do not listen to others! The sensitivity of Reitman's direction was very evident and most likely quite different from the other films he has made. The actors were excellent, and the scenes very authentic and believable. The actress who played Kate Winslet deserved a mention There also should be a mention of the set. The house they used was perfect for the part- and the outside your space and gardeners proved to be a fine setting.",Labor Day
114,gioprete79,Kate Winslet proves again that she is one of the greatest actresses of all times.,7,4 December 2013,"I haven't got to say a lot about this upcoming motion picture but praise Kate Winslets dynamic intimate and breath taking performance.Kate once again gives it all on the big screen. And one thing I am telling you for sure, she is going for an Oscar. Since we saw Kate winning that golden statue back in 2009 for her performance in the historic ''The Reader'', Kate has been a bit distant from the screen. Apart from her minor movie roles in ''Contagion'' and ''Movie 43'' and of course the successful ''Carnage'', Kate hadn't had a big emotional performance like that for years. The English Rose once again leaves us with tears on our eyes with her performance. She proves us through the film that she for sure deserves the title of one of the greatest actresses of all times. Apart from Winslet's praised and acclaimed performance the film is generally very good and it will make you tear a bit that's a fact! However, the screenplay is a bit dull for this film and the rhythm of the whole motion picture a bit slow. I wont be surprised if the film receives mixed reviews from critics.",Labor Day

But its hard to believe anyone would bond that closely and decide to move with a stranger, must less your kidnapper within a time span of a few days?

No not an exciting film but one that delves deeper in to the characters, you are captured immediately when Kate winslet's character, who is very troubled begins to interact with the escaped convict who is played by Josh Brolin. As he settles in and you watch their relationship develop in to something very beautiful, you discover darker secrets which adds more intrigue and keeps your attention. The son of Kate Winslet delivers a ten out of ten performance, also giving you an individual storyline, not only is he a key part in the film talking you through everything as it unfolds, but you see his struggle through puberty and finding his way as a young boy learning about relationships between men and women. This film is very dark, yet i feel there was beautiful message conveyed throughout. A must see! If you come across this film you should never over look it.

119,oganicfingers,So good,8,11 August 2021,"Labor Day is a very different film for Reitman. Rather than being sharp and quick-witted, it's careful and considered. Before the Telluride screening, he introduced the film as a story about love, so I was shocked when the film began as a thriller in which an escaped convict kidnaps a single mother and her 12-year-old son. Although still as Reitman said, it's a gentle, loving story. Rather than following someone dodging police bullets or breaking into buildings, Reitman lets the camera calmly glide up streets and around trees in the quiet yet intense New England setting or watch three people bake a pie together.",Labor Day
120,snbarnes2003,"Mmmm, Peach Pie",2,20 April 2014,"In one scene the escaped convict is to scared to leave the house for fear of being caught, while in the next scene he's in the front yard changing a tire or clearing leaves from the gutter. Within three uneventful days the convict, mother and son are in love and by the convict simply shaving his beard they can leave town, pass the road blocks and make for Canada. Is it really that easy? Neighbors make random entry into the house, fain suspicion, then leave. Police never really feature, despite a convicted double murderer of his own wife and child roaming the streets, although they do make random drive-by's past the convicts new home, perhaps they should have driven past when he was cleaning the gutter? While all of this happens our convict makes unnecessarily violent moves towards his captives, then lovingly makes peach pie....The whole plot is disconnected, there seems to be no logical reason for anyone doing anything - except for that was how it was written. The actors, despite all of their talent, look bored and uninterested.If you're able to take logic out of the story you will find a love story, as removed from reality as it is.

123,juliana-zee,"Not great, but I loved some things.",6,15 June 2014,"I was not feeling much for this movie at the beginning, when the single mom and her son took the escaped convict home with them from their shopping trip. Adele, the mom, played flawlessly by Kate Winslet, has a serious anxiety disorder that keeps her home most of the time. She has ventured out shopping, at the start of Labor Day weekend only because her son Henry is unable to fit into any of his clothing, and they need to get him some back to school duds immediately. The son encounters the escaped con, Frank, first. Played by Josh Brolin, he is handsome, but scary, with some blood dripping from him for added effect. He asks Henry if he and his mom can help him. When they approach Adele, Frank has his thumb and middle finger on Henry's neck, and he asks for her help, implying that Henry has already endorsed this idea. Adele, despite her anxiety disorder, allows this rough man, who is being rough with her only child to enter their car, and subsequently their lives. Naturally he is the perfect gentleman and is a father to Henry in ways that his own father fails, and manages to soothe Adele's disabling anxiety. He is fixing every broken part of their car and home over this long weekend. I found myself becoming impatient with every fix. It seemed as though all this little family needed was an ex-con on the run to come into their lives and fix their house, car and broken hearts and the sky would fill with sunshine forever.Just when I was prepared to hate this movie, I found that I absolutely loved some aspects of it. I loved the pie making scene. A neighbor brings a bowl of peaches and Frank sets about putting together a pie, rolling out the dough. It was mesmerizing and beautiful. They each took a turn in the process, and it seemed full of love and healing somehow. Henry's middle school struggle, becoming a little man in the context of having an impaired mom, and a pretend perfect dad; learning about girls and sexuality, suddenly having this ex-con in the house who treats him and his mom better than anyone ever has.

125,shahalambasharat,Take home message,5,5 February 2014,"What I am reviewing is more related to the theme of the film as I found it quite interesting. I am taking the liberty of looking at the roles of the characters from my own perspective rather than the movie-maker's. I see three main characters in this movie- Adele, Frank (escaped convict) and Gerald (ex-husband). Even though the movie makers may have wanted us to focus more on the first two but I see all 3 of them equally prominent. Adele is a dreamer. Apparently she did not go along well with her ex- husband, most likely because of her idealistic demands from the relationship; therefore she ends up living an isolated life filled with hardships and lack of protection. Apparently, she takes the legal custody of her son and gives him his share of whatever she chose for herself. The most disturbing thing about her character is the fact that she falls for an escaped convict who has not even talked about his past to her. Interestingly, Frank never reveals to her under what circumstances he gets his sentence, nor does she make any serious attempt to dig into his past but allows herself to be drifted in to a romantic world just because she is impressed by his household chores and man's jobs. What's worse is the fact that she lets her son grow in his company as well and decides to move to another country and live life of an outlaw and chooses the same for her son as well. She doesn't seem to care much about her son's schooling as well. It may look romantic if you are a teenager but it's just so hard to swallow if you are a parent. And, people who think that going to Canada is just like crossing the state line need to know that one cannot cross international border without a passport, and thus without revealing your true identity. That may be actually a flaw in the movie itself.Frank is an honest man, a victim of circumstance. Wrongfully convicted of something he never did or intended to do. There are many prisoners in the USA who are serving punishments for the crimes they never did. He is a caring guy and brings joy to people around him. He gets his reward at the end of his sentence- company of a woman who he loves.Gerald is a responsible father and a responsible husband and believer of long lasting relationships. It may seem initially that he is flamboyant because he made an affair with his secretary. But the fact that he ends up marrying her and raising a family with her plus taking care of the children that she brought along with her from her previous marriage, more than clears Gerald's image. He admits to his son that he probably wasn't the 'ideal guy' his mother had dreamed of. So he broke up and got in to a more doable relationship. He plays his role as father well. He takes Henry out with the rest of his family every weekend. He is keen to know who his ex-wife is hanging out with for the sake of his son, and is always there for his son at all the milestones of his life. Gerald is more realistic than emotional and is far happier in his not so complicated world than Adele.",Labor Day
126,jims070868,Great but should have followed more of the book plot,7,16 April 2014,"I thought this was a very good movie. However, like all movies based on books, I feel some important parts of the book were left out. Especially in the case of Henry's half sister. In the book her name was Chloe and she represents everything that Adele (Kate Winslet's character) couldn't have. What I mean is a sibling for Henry and when the father could not handle it he went out and created a brand new family for himself. That is where Henry's half sister comes in. The little girl who played her was adorable and I found out her name is Alyssa Walsh. They should have expanded on this character, I'm sure this young actress would have been great.

127,yojimbo-biff,Mommy Porn (spoilers a'plenty),1,5 January 2015,"There is so much wrong with this movie that it's hard to know where to start.Let's begin with the plot. Frank, an escaped convict, takes a single mother, Adele, and her son, Henry, hostage. Over the course of a few days, Adele falls in love with Frank and Henry latches on to him as a father-figure. This sort of thing is not unheard of (Stockholm Syndrome, anyone?) but within a day? After taking them hostage, less than 24 hours later they're begging him not to leave! Setting aside the fact that Frank is played by Josh Brolin (this is a movie after all) he threatened Henry and tied Adele up for the night. We're supposed to believe that they're not still terrified of him at this point? Again, this takes me back to the time factor. Everything that happens in this movie is entirely plausible given enough time. I could easily see this kind of bond taking place over a month or so. The movie tries to gloss this over by making Frank into a fantasy man. He cooks! He cleans! He fixes things! Frank throws a baseball with Henry! Frank rubs Adele's shoulders! Frank is interested in everything Adele says! Frank dances! (Now you see why I titled this review ""Mommy Porn"".)This brings me to my next point: plausibility. Escaped Convict/Hearthrob/Fantasy Man Frank (I'm sure there's lots of those running around) spends a lot of time working around the house in broad daylight. The movie establishes early on that Adele is very depressed and rarely leaves the house. Now a strange man shows up out of nowhere and parades around in full view of the neighbors at the same time an escaped convict is on the loose. Given how nosy the entire town seems to be (neighbors dropping by, the bank questioning withdrawals, the grocery story clerk commenting on items purchased), nobody notices Frank? I thought maybe he was fixing things ninja-style but there's a scene where he teaches Henry how to change a tire on a car that's parked in the driveway. Not exactly keeping a low profile.Just so this isn't completely negative let me say this. I'm a big fan of Kate Winslet. I think Josh Brolin is a good actor. I've enjoyed Jason Reitman's previous movies. This movie is well-made. The performances (most of them) are very good. If this was the plot of a romance novel, I would chuckle at the silliness of it all and move on. This movie ranks up there (or down there) with Twilight and 50 Shades. If your idea of romance is a 100+ year old vampire finding his true love in an underage high-school girl or a rich guy spanking his secretary, then Labor Day is right up your alley. For the rest of us, this movie is a horrible mess.",Labor Day

I guess we could tell a entirely different story for the mother and the escaped convict. I would be welcome to all. Brilliant story telling but again: when you tell a story that is static and not visually moving; you better have the goods to grip.
