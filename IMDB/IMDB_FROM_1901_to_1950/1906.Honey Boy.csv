0,SnoopyStyle,interesting but not mind blowing,6,6 March 2020,"Otis Lort (Lucas Hedges) is a young Hollywood star mired in addiction. After crashing his car, he is forced into court ordered rehab in lieu of a 4 year prison sentence. He must face the trauma of his childhood as a child star being controlled by his recovering biker father James (Shia LaBeouf).I applaud any therapeutic relief Shia LaBeouf is able to achieve with this film. On top of that, there are a couple of really compelling scenes. I really like the adult young Otis resisting rehab. One thing that took me out of the movie is LaBeouf's look. It's very superficial but it does look like a clown. It's a clown on a bike and it throws me off. It's not about his performance. I also like him when he runs out of his rehab group. I like his performance but I don't like his look. Also there is only limited tension. He faces the danger of his addiction everyday and there is a danger of jail. Those dangers were never elevated. In the end, it's about his childhood and I find it interesting but not mind blowing. That's this movie. It's interesting but not mind blowing.",Honey Boy
1,CinemaSerf,A forthright and moving exercise in confrontation and vulnerability.,8,6 December 2019,"Yikes, but this is an angry film. An almost unrecognisable Shia LaBeouf portrays a father - a former rodeo clown - in this semi-autobiographical project. He has a pretty turbulent relationship with his son so, perhaps unsurprisingly, the kid goes off the rails and the story is cleverly related from the perspectives of the older version of the child (Lucas Hedges - now a 22 year old with anger-management and alcohol issues) and a really impressive Noah Jupe (also great in Le Mans '66) playing Otis as a 12 year old whose work as a child actor on daytime television is keeping himself and his father employed, as they live a sort of hand-to-mouth existence in a motel. I was never quite certain as to whether (or not) he is actually loved, or is just being used by his father as a mealticket. This is a moving, touching story - perhaps more so because it is written by a man who does not appear to wish to cover up much in this warts-and-all representation of some of his own early life. FKA Twigs offers a few moments of tenderness to the younger Otis as he struggles to come to terms with his fathers indifference. Otherwise this is a profoundly honest and absorbing, occasionally difficult 90 minutes. Ought to be seen, though.",Honey Boy
2,evanston_dad,Cinematic Narcissism,3,16 December 2019,"""Honey Boy"" is 90 minutes of Shia LaBeouf in an unacceptable haircut acting like a twerp.LaBeouf the personality is incredibly unlikable to begin with, so it took virtually no time for me to tire of his one-note, relentlessly unpleasant performance. I knew going in that this movie was basically him working through his daddy issues, but I thought it would bring some more universal enlightenment and not be quite such an act of cinematic narcissism. The point of ""Honey Boy"" is that messed up dads raise messed up kids. Well I can just hang out with people I'm related to come to that conclusion, without paying $10 bucks for it.""Honey Boy"" has one bright spot, and that is the performance of Noah Jupe as the LaBeouf surrogate as a little boy.Grade: C-",Honey Boy
3,ferguson-6,Shia's childhood,7,10 November 2019,"Greetings again from the darkness. Most 12 year olds don't have a job. Perhaps their parents have assigned a few chores around the house to help them learn responsibility, but for the most part, they go to school and play ... the things that kids do. Shia LaBeouf had 2 jobs as a kid. He was a rising actor and he was employer/quasi-guardian of his father. Now in his 30's, LaBeouf has written a screenplay about his childhood and he stars as his father in an attempt to exorcise some personal demons. It also happens to make for compelling cinema.The film opens with a montage of cuts between a 20-something LeBeouf (played by Oscar nominee Lucas Hedges) performing stunts on an action movie set (clearly meant to represent TRANSFORMERS) and a serious automobile wreck and subsequent DUI. The wreck caused major damage to his hand and resulted in court-mandated rehabilitation. While in rehab, his therapist (played by Laura San Giacomo) diagnoses him with PTSD ... not military war related, but rather broken family related.In this film, LeBeouf has named the character based on himself Otis, and the character based on his own father James Lort. In addition to Hedges playing the early-20's version, another rising actor, Noah Jupe, plays Otis as a 12 year old. As rehabbing Otis puts his childhood memories to paper, we see flashbacks featuring the younger Otis and his father. They live in a dump of a motel, and ride to the TV show set (meant to be ""Even Stevens"") on dad's motorcycle. James Lort/dad is a former performing clown, recovering addict, and ex-con. He's the kind of guy who talks a big game and blames everyone else for keeping him from succeeding. To put it mildly ... he's a jerk. That's not to say he doesn't have his moments as a caring parent, but those moments are nullified by the bullying and threats of violence towards his young son. That son is desperate to please his dad, yet wise enough to know that he's not to be trusted.Shia LeBeouf dives in head first to play the man who had such an impact on his early years. This, mind you, is the kind of man who offers cigarettes to his young son, makes fun of his pre-pubescent body, and is quite jealous of his budding career. LeBeouf is at his best in a difficult role that surely cuts very deep for him. Supporting roles are played by singer FKA Twigs as the shy neighbor girl who befriends Otis, plus Natasha Lyonne, Maika Monroe, Clifton Collins Jr, and Byron Bowers.Director Alma Har'el structures her first narrative feature film (she has previously worked on videos and documentaries) with timelines showing Otis at the two ages. There are no fancy camera tricks. Instead she trusts these talented actors to bring it home ... and that they do very well. Lucas Hedges was Oscar nominated for MANCHESTER BY THE SEA, and he is in the beautiful upcoming film WAVES. Noah Jupe is a star in the making, having previously appeared in A QUIET PLACE, and in the exhilarating upcoming film FORD VS FERRARI. These are some top notch actors at their very best.As viewers, we have to remove ourselves from feeling anger and disgust towards the James Lort character. That's easier said than done when he says things like ""The only thing my father gave me of any value was pain."" It's meant to sum up his reasoning for his own parenting approach. There is a truly brilliant, and well-coordinated scene that acts as a three-way phone conversation between father, son, and estranged wife/mother. The kid is put smack in the middle of the two people who are supposed to love and nurture and protect him. Instead, Otis comes across as the adult. We do get some comic relief with the 'world's first daredevil chicken', but this is just not a warm, cuddly father-son fairy tale. This was real life for Shia LeBeouf and he's brave to bring it out in the open, even if it's less confession and more therapeutic session. He deserves it after hearing, ""I'm your cheerleader, Honey Boy"", and ""Trust me, I'm your father.""",Honey Boy
4,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Catharsis incarnate.,7,12 December 2019,"'Honey Boy (2019)' is an, essentially, autobiographical account of Shia LaBeouf's strained relationship with his father and his attempts to overcome the resultant PTSD while in court-mandated rehab. The film was actually written during LaBeouf's stay in the previously mentioned clinic. In it, he portrays his own father. It's fair to say that it's an incredibly personal piece; you can practically feel the catharsis oozing from the screen. It's actually very satisfying, feeling almost like a form of medicine. Even though you don't know LaBeouf personally, it's difficult not to feel sort of proud of the guy. His performance as his own father is nothing short of fantastic. It's highly empathetic and feels like an effort to understand, rather than to destroy. The piece posits that the only road to recovery is forgiveness, which removes the generational anger that plagues cyclically abusive families. It makes distinct efforts, mainly via repeated motifs, to convey this theme across both of its time-periods. The direction is markedly good in general. It separates its stories via subtle changes in cinematography, often creating pseudo-surrealist sequences which wonderfully bridge the two. It's a considered effort, for sure. The final movement does occur a little quickly, as the movie seems to skip to its denouement whilst in the middle of its underplayed third act. Prior to this, there's no real sense of escalation, either. Still, these relatively small issues aren't all that detrimental. The performances are brilliant, the narrative is nicely balanced and the end-result is as engaging as it is affecting. It's catharsis incarnate. 7/10",Honey Boy
5,ThomasDrufke,Cinematic Therapy,7,5 December 2019,"Honey Boy is probably a film you appreciate the craft of it more than you do the actual film itself. Shia LaBeouf is having perhaps the best year of his career with this and The Peanut Butter Falcon both getting awards buzz, and rightfully so. LaBeouf, who supposedly wrote the movie in a rehap stint, during the filming of the aforementioned The Peanut Butter Falcon, presents Honey Boy as a form of cinematic therapy while also opening the window for the audience into a potential life of a young hollywood actor providing for his/her family. If for nothing else, Honey Boy is one heck of an interesting story to tell, though it never truly packs the emotional gut punch that I hoped it might.7.1/10",Honey Boy
6,Cineanalyst,Circle of Cinema,7,27 February 2020,"As a semi-autobiographical account of Shia LaBeouf's upbringing, ""Honey Boy"" is a vanity project, to be sure, but I like the doubled mirroring of filmmaking. As a person may be best equipped to examine themselves, which is what LaBeouf did in scripting and starring in this and what the character based on him does in his therapy sessions, some of the most intriguing movies are those that are likewise reflexive. This part seems more revelatory than that a family lineage of drug and other abuses would lead to a child star growing up with his own problems. Although, I think the direction, with the montage of pretty compositions--many of them involving a water pool--set to music to be more banal in its navel gazing than anything in the script, which is engaging enough in its seemingly honest reflection. By the age of 12, LaBeouf's screen surrogate, Otis, is already smoking tobacco and marijuana, witnessing his father's abuse of other drugs, being hit and otherwise mistreated by the man, and having a sexual affair with an adult--besides being a child celebrity and the family's breadwinner through his acting career.While this circle of life revolves, another circle of the existence of the movie itself emerges. The boy is raised in show business, including starring in some trite Disney-esque family fare and migraine-inducing ""Transformers"" type action flicks, before he starts writing his own memories for court-mandated therapy (as played by Lucas Hedges, who had a similar role of therapy through writing in ""Boy Erased"" (2018)). The movie is being written and is seen to be within and as it plays. The plot jumps back and forth between Otis as an adult and as a child, with the adult remembering and composing the childhood memories we see in the picture. In the end, Otis, the adult author, informs his father--or the memory of his father--that he's making a movie about him. Á la ""The Player"" (1992), the pitch is for the picture that just played. Furthering the circle of doubling, LaBeouf stars as his father, while other actors play Otis.",Honey Boy
7,nairtejas,MAMI MFF Review: Honey Boy (5 Stars),5,21 October 2019,"The performances in Honey Boy made me gasp in awe. Shia LaBeouf is so energetic and fast and lively and tremendously infectious in his dialogue delivery that I am going to make it a point to watch everything he acts in and read everything he writes. But then equally charming is Noah Jupe who plays a young prolific film extra in Hollywood while being managed by his hotheaded and abusive father separated from his wife perhaps because of his characteristics. What begins as an exploration of PTSD in cinema people (extras who take the toll for scenes that require technical and aesthetic perfection) smoothly turns into a drama between a father and his son with the typical roles reversed. Jupe plays the son who works so that they can drink soda and eat unhealthy and his father can pay hookers while LaBeouf plays the father, the parasite, who is but only human even though he controls the family thread that's left between them. Honey Boy makes you think and makes you yearn for relationships even though it highlights how they can go wrong sometimes and how such wrongs can have devastating impact in the long term. The fast-paced conversations between the two lead certainly outsmarts the haggard plotline that aches to the finish line which troubled me some. And boy, Lucas Hedges has grown up.

8,UniqueParticle,Riveting all around should've been nominated,10,30 March 2020,"Shia Leboeuf should've been nominated for the screenplay and acting! Wildly entertaining throughout no wonder Honey Boy got praised. Beautiful cinematography that inspires me to wanna live in California rather than NC like other films, I don't know though I hear different things. Absolutely love the glossy colors in several parts! Heartbreaking the things Shia experienced; I'm sure not many knew about his life struggles. Highly recommend Honey Boy it's very well made and touching, some would consider it a tearjerker.",Honey Boy
9,eddie_baggins,A noteworthy LaBeouf experience,6,9 March 2020,"Forming a strong part of an early career renaissance for its star and writer Shia LaBeouf, alongside 2019 indie darling and breakout hit The Peanut Butter Falcon, Honey Boy is a deeply personal and confronting examination of LaBeouf's childhood and relationship with his demanding and troubled father that is worth the price of admission to witness LaBeouf deliver one of his best turns in years (playing a version of his father) in partnership with a noteworthy childhood performance from emerging star Noah Jupe.Made in collaboration with debut narrative filmmaker Alma Har'el, you can only imagine what type of wounds Honey Boy opened up for its at time troubled star but in what was surely a therapeutic and cleansing experience, Har'el and LaBeouf's quietly devastating and uniquely structured film allows us to gain a better understanding of the somewhat illusive actor who has been a part of the Hollywood scene for the better part of two decades now, a career that has seen its fair share of ups and downs in regards to quality and personal life decision making.For years on end it had appeared as though LaBeouf was destined for a sadly declining career progression but it's a sight for sore eyes to see the talented performer get it all back on track again as he pours his heart and soul into the role of James Lort, whose mismanaged life and poor parenting skills takes its toll on both the young Otis and the older Otis played well by Lucas Hedges, who is one of the films most underutilized assets as the struggling movie star version of LaBeouf, who finds himself regressing due to his troubled childhood as an actor and son to Lort.There's not much of Honey Boy that conforms to usual movie storytelling as we go back and forward between Jupe's and Hedges trials and tribulations, with those seeking a traditional way of plot developments and engagements sure to be left disappointed by a dreamlike film that does at times suffer from a lack of focus and clear direction in what can at times (particularly in a weakish middle section) be a distracting way of telling LaBeouf's journey into the man that he is today.There's a lot of screen time devoted to Otis and James time staying at a divey motel, doing not a lot more than arguing about irrelevant things or Lort drinking or drugging himself into oblivion and while more than likely true to its based on reality happenings, these aspects don't make for the most thrilling or engaging of elements to the film that at times feels as though it's on a slow and pointless road to nowhere in particular.When the emotional beats kick in however, moments such as Lort breaking down in front of Otis after a string of disappointing decisions or Hedges coming to terms with his PTSD symptoms, Honey Boy is a unique and insightful examination of growing up and parental relationships and with such great performances from its lead cast and a script that means a lot more in the context of its inspiration, Har'el and LaBeouf's original offering stands up as a fine piece of independent filmmaking that is a must-watch for fans of one of the most unique characters operating in the Hollywood system.Final Say -A deeply personal, odd and sometimes confronting experience that is an open-book look into the early life and making of its star Shia LaBeouf, Honey Boy doesn't always work but its original approach to its material and string of strong turns make it a solid, if not always gripping watch.3 highway garden plots out of 5",Honey Boy
10,digitalbeachbum,"Difficult to dive in at first, but then it warms up",8,18 May 2020,"Shia LaBeouf definitely had to do some growing up. I really didn't like him much when he first started out. In fact, if I knew he was in a movie I would think, ""ok this movie is going to completely suck""Then Shia grew up and matured. Sort of like wines do. At first they are nothing but color and fruit, but give them twenty years in an oak casket and they turn in to something far better.Shia LaBeouf has really shown his skills as a writer and actor. He's really !@#$ good. I don't know if he ran off to mediate on a mountain top with some monks or if he found some acting coach like Strasberg or Stanislavsky, but he has really changed his on screen presenceShia LaBeouf, I hope, will continue making great movies and Honey Boy is one of them. It is worthy of a !@#$ OSCAR! and it got snubbed and all the more reason why Hollywood is full of itself.The production has grade A direction, writing and cinematography. It is the life story of Shia LaBeouf and he put his heart in to it from start to finish. The effort he puts forth, is amazing, and I believe is a caricature of his father or how he remembers his father.This is a classic movie. Watch it.",Honey Boy

12,paul-allaer,Feel-bad movie of the year (with apologies to Mr. LaBeouf),5,9 December 2019,"""Honey Boy"" (2019 release; 95 min.) brings the story of James and his son Otis. As the movie opens, it is ""2005"" and Otis works on a movie set. Later he drinks heavily and eventually gets in a car crash, resisting arrest and berating at the cops. He ends up at a rehabilitation camp, which can still turn into a 4 year prison term if he fails that camp. We then go to ""1995"", where 12 yr. old Otis is working on a movie set, and eventually goes home with his dad, home being a cheap motel near the 101 Freeway. We get to know James, who in no time becomes insufferable... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience.Couple of comments: this is the long-rumored semi-autobiographical movie written by and starring Shia LaBeouf (playing the role of his dad, no less), examining the relationship with his dad. Let me pause here for a second. I typically like ""emotionally heavy"" movies. But I was not ready for the relentless onslaught of emotional and physical abuse that the 12 tr. old boy suffers from his dad. I mean, I cannot recall a less sympathetic character in the movies in a long time. He carries so many burdens that supposedly he can't but help himself, bit is that really this case? Anyway, for me this was the feel-bad movie of the year, and I came close to leaving before the end. When we did come to the end, I was more than ready to leave the theater. My apologies to Mr. LaBeouf, who poured his soul into this project. All of the technical aspects of the movie are top-notch, with great performances from Shia LaBeouf, Noah Jupe (as the 12 yr. old), Luca Hedges (as the 22 yr. old), and check out as well English singer FKA Twigs as the ""Shy Girl"". All of them are great, but it didn't make me feel any better...The movie premiered at this year's Subdance film festival to immediate buzz (Amazon Studios ended up buying the film). It finally opened this weekend on 3 screens here in Greater Cincinnati. The Sunday early evening screening at my local art-house theater was attended so-so (7 people to be exact). Let me immediately add that this film is currently certified 93% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, so a lot of people think highly of this film, and I can understand why that is, but I just didn't enjoy the viewing experience. If you are into emotionally heavy movies, or are simply a fan of Shia LaBeouf or Lucas Hedges, I'd certainly invite you to check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu=ray, and draw your own conclusion.",Honey Boy
13,subxerogravity,It's very real and very raw.,7,17 November 2019,"It's a strange movie in a sense that Shia Lebeauf who wrote and starred in this picture is kinda saying thank you to his father for making him the man he is today, but the portrayal of his father is not the most favorable.
Movies do not get realer than this one. It holds nothing back and tells no lies it's just emotionally honest. I'll give it that. Shia's betrayal of that overbearing father was great and the movie overall is an excellent watch.",Honey Boy
14,jtindahouse,LaBeouf proves he can do more than just act,7,19 February 2020,"I love Shia LaBeouf, I really do. I'll watch basically anything he puts his name to. The man blew up his own career by being too honest, and I respect him immensely for that. I didn't actually realise going in to 'Honey Boy' that it was him telling a very personal and true story abut the relationship he had with his father. I worked it out very quickly though that that was what was being portrayed. It can't be easy to write a film like this, but LaBeouf does a terrific job of presenting how he perceived things, without ever feeling like he's trying to ram a point down your throat.The acting in this film is incredible. Firstly LaBeouf playing his father is truly mesmerising. Sure he knew the guy better than anyone, but that isn't enough to justify just how phenomenal he was in this film. I'm surprised he didn't get a lot more love during awards season. Lucas Hedges also really impressed me. Within 30 seconds of him being on screen I was able to say, ""That guy is playing LaBeouf."" He mimicked him perfectly in voice and actions. Finally Noah Jupe blew me away. What an incredibly difficult performance for a child actor to have to pull off. This is no ordinary kid he was playing. He was superb and also deserves every bit of recognition he gets.This is clearly an extremely personal film for LaBeouf. He has laid his heart and soul out on the table. The result is a very good film that is well worth your time, whether you're a LaBeouf fan or not. I recommend checking this one out.",Honey Boy

18,masonfisk,"TAKE THE SWEET W/THE SOUR, BOY...!",7,23 March 2021,"Shia LaBeouf's semi-autobiographical 2019 account (he wrote the screenplay) about his rise as a child actor (he was the star of Even Stevens) but his conflict at home (if you can call it that since he was staying at a motel) w/his recovering addict father (played by LeBeouf) leaves a hurt that will affect him even as he grows older. Shifting between the present (where his older self is played by Oscar nominee Lucas Hedges) & his younger self, we see him booking gigs & has a decent work ethic (he's usually early to set & well prepared) but ultimately is felled by his father's emotionally abusive relationship since he's the de-facto breadwinner & his mother (not seen but heard in a phone call) lives elsewhere. The role of stage father does not become him as we see him fall into bad habits (lusting after women at his son's acting jobs, planting pot seeds by the side of the highway) & his own inabilities are seemingly thrown back in his face as his son's star is in the ascendant. Not breaking especially new ground, this film does find a nice off kilter take on tried & true material w/LaBeouf acquitting himself nicely as writer & co-star (I read somewhere a follow up screenplay of his was snatched up as well for production so kudos to him) but it was weird seeing this take because if people know of the series Project Greenlight, specifically the second season, LaBeouf was cast in that season's film The Battle of Shaker Heights & there were some scenes of him interacting w/his mother (her photo pops up in this film's end credits) & nothing in their relationship belied what was going on.

20,aidanratesmovies,The Most Underrated Film of 2019,10,10 April 2020,"A bold, brilliant, and deeply personal drama, that hits closer to the hart than most films even dare to try. The performances are fantastic, with Shia LaBeouf, Noah Jupe, and Lucas Hedges providing the best of the films high class performances. The film doesn't just show the realities of show business and trauma, but lets us feel the pain being brought upon the character of Otis, which is both a daring, and impressive feat to match. The script is most brilliant in this way, as well as its use of dialogue and progression of plot and story. The pacing is excellent, and I was fully entertained all the way through. It can be a bit hard to watch, but it's also the point, and it illustrates it much clearer than most. The cinematography is excellent, with some shots in the film truly putting a grin on my face. In the end, Honey Boy is a great success and a fantastic semi-autobiography that gets its story right, and is truly the most underappreciated film of 2020.
My Rating: 10/10",Honey Boy
21,questl-18592,Honey Film,8,20 February 2020,"I wish I'd gotten to this one sooner. Exceptional acting, a touching story, and a fascinating look into the life of Shia LaBeouf.The parallels drawn here of the difficulties a child actor faces when forced into the spotlight as he struggles to separate reality from fiction and father from manager. It's no wonder that child actors go through such tumultuous periods as they grow up and into their own.I found this to be very affecting, the kind of heartfelt story that likely is only possible because of LaBeouf's direct involvement.It pushes a little hard on the film school artsy touches in spots, and I think the way they dance between the two different ages could've been handled better, but aside from that I found this to be poignant and powerful in its own way. Definitely worth checking out if you're able.",Honey Boy
22,truemythmedia,On Screen Therapy,8,7 January 2020,"Remember when Shia LaBeouf went to rehab and had to undergo a bunch of therapy. Have you ever wondered what that therapy was for or what it was like?Then this is the movie for you.The story is mostly told in flashback with Lucas Hedges (""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"") playing 22 year old Shia proxy Otis, going through therapy, resisting therapy, writing in journals, and developing a better sense of his childhood and career. These flashbacks star Noah Jupe (""A Quiet Place"") as 12 year old Otis who is acting and living with his father James (Shia LaBeouf, ""Peanut Butter Falcon"") in a rundown efficiencies complex across from a ramshacklee house.James is pretty much what most people would consider a worst case scenario father. He yells at Otis, squanders his money, lets him smoke, is a convicted felon (sexual crime), hits on movie crew members half his age, and all manner of derelict behavior. Otis is just trying to figure out what it means that his father is a person that he mostly has to take care of, not be taken care of by, and put up with rather than love or be loved by.Watching this film you get a real sense of what a chaotic life some children lead, even here in America, even some of the most famous people in the world. We get insight into the breakdowns that child actors frequently suffer and a peak into what recovery from those breakdowns looks like.I wanted to be blown away and transported by this film but I just wasn't. That doesn't mean I don't think this is a good film or even an important and very worthwhile one for many people. I just didn't connect with it in the way that I think many will.Despite this, I am extremely happy that this movie was made, made in the way that it was, and will be readily available to most people since it was done by Amazon Studios. I am glad for a couple of reasons. The first is what I mentioned above about people getting to see what is going on in some of these meltdown Hollywood situations behind the scenes and hopefully create a little empathy in those people who watched Britney shave her head, or Michael Jackson name his baby Blanket, and then go on to make jokes about it.The second is because it is a fantastic example of what I think is the most admirable spirit from which to make true art. Shia LaBeouf wrote this movie and chose to play his dad as a way of working out his own father issues. This movie wasn't made because it would be a box office smash. It was made because someone had something in their soul that was dying to get out and this was the only way he could do it.Watching the film you feel like you are watching Shia ""do"" therapy. He's trying to see from his father's perspective and get in touch with a man that he couldn't understand through his own 12 year old eyes yet. You see him internalizing self-hatred, reckless behavior spilling out of his pores, and desperation to set his son's life on a better track flying like spittle from his angry mouth. It's a brilliant performance and vulnerable piece of work.Playing opposite him Noah Jupe does a great job as young Otis, struggling to understand the harshness and dereliction of his father yet yearning for his affection and guidance, though he can't trust him. His attempts to assimilate his father into a normal life and take care of him are consistently frustrated by the shame James feels at being dependent on his son. This shame, by contrast, highlights the resentment that Otis feels for not being allowed to be a kid or have a loving family because he already has had to grow up and take responsibility in so many ways.This dynamic and exploration is the heart of the film and, in my opinion, many great works of art. An artist laying their heart out there and hoping that someone, anyone, connects to, is helped by, feels mirrored by, or understood through the sacrifice one undergoes when they hold their soul in their hand for people to see.",Honey Boy

24,saadgkhan,Disappointing Honey Boy,3,20 April 2020,"Honey Boy - C- (Disappointing)The movie treats Shia's life as an open book as if everyone watching the movie knows what Shia went through in real life. You can clearly see his obsession with his father that he even endup playing him in the movie. PTSD is real regardless of the age, rich, poor, famous or ordinary.The movie tries soo hard to create conflict by recreated the same scenario 10 times between father and son or therapist and Shia. That you're unable to feel any growth towards unsanitary to sanity. If movie had focused more on Shia's life till now than his father. It would have been impactful but unfortunately again this is more story of his father than the son or maybe Shia wanted more screen time. His sympathies towards his father is evident as he refused to acknowledge what he truly was a coward felon feeding off his son's money and fame. Which is understandable he was his father and he would have him in any form in his life.Anyways, Some other reviewer rightly pointed out that it's a vanity project.",Honey Boy

26,Jeremy_Urquhart,"Well made, and perhaps even uncomfortably personal",7,10 March 2020,"Honey Boy is a film written by Shia LaBeouf, starring Shia LaBeouf, about Shia LaBeouf, and most likely made first and foremost for Shia LaBeouf. If any of those statements put you off, it's unlikely to be a movie that will have a great amount of appeal to you. But, if you're on the same page as me, in terms of respecting LaBeouf's career trajectory over the last few years, as well as enjoying his work in fairly recent films such as American Honey and The Peanut Butter Falcon, then you'll likely find a good deal to enjoy in Honey Boy.LaBeouf has come a long way since the days in which he seemed to annoy audiences more than anything, and in hindsight, maybe the way we tended to treat him was more than a little unfair. After all, he was most famous for films like Transformers and the fourth Indiana Jones, which hardly had amazing screenplays in the first place. Legendary actors like Daniel Day Lewis or Denzel Washington would surely struggle to turn in great performances with the kind of material LaBeouf had to work with in those films. That being said, I'm not saying he's on the same level as those actors, but within the sorts of indie films he's been doing lately, he's really been shining and standing out. And with Honey Boy, he proves he can write a decent screenplay too.It's a simple story, with a somewhat flashy structure that nevertheless isn't ever too hard to follow. Otis is introduced as a troubled young actor in his twenties, who finds himself in rehab circa 2005. Otis is quite clearly LaBeouf, which we can understand from the film's opening montage, depicting him appearing in the sorts of Michael Bay blockbusters the real LaBeouf used to be well known for. While in rehab, a therapist convinces him to search and explore his past, and to confront the source of his trauma and current problems. Turns out, a whole lot of his troubles stem from his strained relationship with his sometimes well-meaning, though sometimes very abusive father, played- in a fascinating casting/ artistic choice- by the actual Shia LaBeouf.I'd say one half to two thirds of the movie centres in on a pre-teen Otis struggling with being a child actor and his father, and while these extended flashbacks have little in the way of mounting tension, developing drama, or structure, they're still for the most part quite compelling, and towards the end, emotionally potent too. Noah Jupe and LaBeouf turn in great performances as well, it's worth mentioning. With perhaps a little more artistic liberty taken with the truth, this could have been stretched to a full-length film with a more compelling narrative, though the more honest, less story-heavy approach is appreciated. And it's not as though the material with 22-year-old Otis is bad, as Lucas Hedges does some good work, and both Byron Bowers and Martin Starr turn in very entertaining performances as people Otis meets while in rehab.I think due to the loose, stream of consciousness flow of the film's events, it ends up feeling quite a bit longer than its 94 minutes. It's a slightly tricky complaint to make, because with a more traditional structure, perhaps Honey Boy would have run the risk of feeling more like a derivative, by the numbers biopic. And I don't think it wanted to be a strict biopic, exactly. More a reflection on and depiction of a traumatic time in LaBeouf's own life, put out into the world to potentially help others who are dealing with or who have dealt with similar situations. And for that, it serves its purpose well. On top of that, the performances are all good, the characters straightforward but believable, and it's generally well-shot too, with a few memorable sequences employing colour in a way that adds to the nostalgic, dreamlike haze that some of the childhood flashbacks are going for.A small-scale, fairly loose feeling character study largely about a somewhat polarising actor's childhood life is not going to be for everyone, and I respect that. It wasn't 100% for me either, because while I liked most of it, it dragged a little in parts and I came away mostly impressed but not totally in love. But that's okay. I think it'll mean a great deal more to others, who can find its themes immensely relatable, and for that reason, I think it's a film that deserves a good deal of respect. Shia LaBeouf was brave to put something this personal and honest feeling out there, and I imagine the process was very cathartic for him, especially through portraying his father- the source of so many of his problems. My respect for him that's been growing over the last couple of years only continues to grow after seeing Honey Boy. If it sounds interesting to you, I'd recommend checking it out. Even if you aren't generally a fan of LaBeouf, but want to see what all the recent fuss regarding him is about, this is likely a great place to start.",Honey Boy
27,aciessi,Shia's Reckoning.,9,9 February 2020,"Honey Boy is a Shia LaBeouf biopic, done only how Shia LaBeouf could do it. We never thought it could or should exist, but thank God it does. Honey Boy is profoundly moving and majorly insightful about what make's Shia tick. For a while, nobody could understand why Shia was so aggressive and bizarre in his behavior. This film makes sense of it. He is the product of abuse and a lack of proper parenting. Shia portrays what is supposed to be his own father, in a role that has certainly been overlooked last year. Not only is he good, he would in any other year be a lock in a Best Supporting Actor category. We journey back and forth between his childhood as a rising star, and rehab as a washed up actor. It's jarring in that sense, but you couldn't have it any other way. Shia, after this, I wouldn't say that you ""Aren't Famous Anymore"". If you still are, there's something wrong here.",Honey Boy
28,rockman182,Honey Boy(2019),7,15 November 2019,"I for one, am fascinated by Shia LaBeouf. I'm sure I'm not the only one. He is a polarizing figure in Hollywood and I was amazed that this guy marathoned all of his films in the cinema. I think he is a wonderful actor as well, see The Peanut Butter Falcon and American Honey for proof. When I heard he was writing a memoir of sorts about the tumultuous relationship with his father, I was definitely going to go see it. This film was pretty much what I expected it to be.A semi-biographical picture about the life of Shia LaBeouf, Honey Boy follows a young rising child actor and his bipolar relationship with his father. His father is a former rodeo clown and is a deadbeat, for a lack of a better word. The relationship is marred with verbal and physical abuse. The child actor grows up with post traumatic stress disorder because of his upbringing and must learn to come up with ways to cope with his past that effects him. The film stars Lucas Hedges and Shia LaBeouf in the father role.The story feels authentic because it is. I think the child actor involved and Shia were very good and you just can't help but feel the toxicity involved in their relationship. Its something that pains the young kid much later into his life, which unfortunately in a common curse in a bad upbringing. I still feel like there were parts of the film that were left unrealized but for what we get its a worthy time watching this film about a relationship that has some ups but mostly a lot of downs.You can feel that the film is a personal one which is why its just an entertaining watch. I'm here trying to look for parallels between the child actors works depicted and a corresponding work that Shia LaBeouf did, to see the similarities between the film and real life. Overall, this will be a painful watch for some and invigorating for others. I enjoyed it for what it was and want to see Shia do more writing for film.7/10",Honey Boy
29,kjproulx,One of the Most Necessary Movies of the Year,10,13 September 2019,"From Even Stevens to Transformers, I've watched Shia Labeouf's career rapidly evolve and slowly wind down to how people view him today. Recognized as someone who may have let the fame get to his head, Honey Boy is a film that will show you why he was the way he was throughout certain moments in his life. Recently premiering at the Toronto International Film Festival and hitting theatres this Fall, here's why I believe Honey Boy is one of the best and most necessary movies of the year.Written by Shia LaBeouf, Honey Boy tells the true story of his own childhood, with name changes to make it not quite so obvious. LaBeouf plays his own father, who is really the central focus of the movie in a way. Noah Jupe and Lucas Hedges portray Otis (the name used for his character in this story) from two different time periods in his life, and both of them deliver award-worthy performances. Those two great performances aside, Shia LaBeouf is the main reason to see this movie.Celebrities are viewed by people in the way they create an image for themselves or by the roles they choose to take in films or television shows. While those things may reflect certain personalities, there will always be certain celebrities that are not allowing their true selves in the public spotlight. For this reason alone, I believe this movie is a necessary watch for those who have negative thoughts toward LaBeouf, especially over the last few years. This movie showcases one of the most incredible performances of his career and it's truly heartbreaking to see behind the curtains.This is the first film that I've seen by director Alma Har'el, but her work here is crazy good. I can't wait to see what her next project will be. The combination of terrific dialogue, great direction, and performances that felt so natural just had me completely immersed in this 93-minute, quaint, emotional roller coaster. Although it's kept simple, there is a lot of reading between the lines for audiences to see when they watch this movie. I love when a film can be effective with even more to say as you look deeper.In the end, Honey Boy is one of the greatest true stories that have been disguised as fiction that I've seen in quite some time. If you know Shia LaBeouf in terms of how he has been behaving lately, I think this movie will be quite the eye-opener for you. This is a great story from start to finish and it even becomes slightly meta at times, which surprisingly worked very well. Using pseudonyms really helped this movie and it can be viewed as a story about any young actor with a hard lifestyle. In my opinion, this is a brilliant little film that I fear will not be noticed by many viewers. Please seek this one out when it hits theatres or streaming. I think you'll be glad that you did.",Honey Boy

35,Alexander_Blanchett,Redemption,8,20 January 2020,"Beautiful and emotional Father/Son Drama and semi Biopic of writer and star Shia LaBeouf. One of the best Indie flicks this year and a great redemption for the ""fallen"" Actor. It was an intersting look behind the curtain of his life but also the life of many child actors out there who are often used as a tool by their parents for ""easy and fast Money"". Its in that regard a dark film but also with many bright highlighhts. A Little bit of humour to rise it up and in General a very Beautiful and intimate film. The acting is strong. You have Noah Jupe who once again proves himself as the most intersting and talented child Actor we have of his Generation at the Moment. He just nailed it and it was absolutely not a simple Task. Its a very moving Performance and absolutely natural. Definitely Top 10 material in a strong year for leading actors. Lucas Hedges who played the older Version of his character also does good. Sometimes a bit too monotone and he generally loses in comparision with his younger ""equivalent"" but still a decent Performance. Last but certainly not least you have Shia LaBeouf himself who Plays his ""own"" Father in this film. A side we have never seen of LaBeouf before. And I am not Talking About the deglam but rather the different facettes he Shows off here, as he never did before. He really goes Deep into that character and uses it as his own Kind of therapy. The result is excellent and absolutely Award worthy. Its a shame he is being widely disregarded this year as he desrves all applausse possible for this dislousure of his Soul. Wonderful Comeback and I hope he uses this Kind of Talent in his future Projects as well.

Shia LaBeouf in Honey Boy is maybe the best I've seen him in any film. He really was breath taking, I couldn't take my eyes off him at times. Lucas Hedges as the older Otis was incredible, and one of my criticisms is that I would have liked to have seen more of him on screen. Then there was the fantastic performance by young actor Noah Jupe, who excelled in his role. All three were sublime, and the film is worth watching purely for these performances alone.However Honey Boy isn't just a display of great acting, it also has fantastic dialogue, complex and engaging characters, and top notch direction. You can tell that this must have been a very cathartic experience for LaBeouf, and this comes through in the film. As such it carries some extra special energy and weight as a piece of art.I'm only giving this film an 8 because I do feel like, as mentioned earlier, we could have done with more of an insight into the life of the older Otis, and the whole film maybe could have done with more time to breathe.A highly accomplished and very personal film, Honey Boy definitely deserves a watch.",Honey Boy

I can imagine that Shia LaBoeuf's self reflective film is like a form of therapy for him. Written by LaBeouf, ""Honey Boy"" is an emotional ride and sometimes a tough film to get through. The cast is sensational, Noah Jupe, Lucas Hedges and FKA Twigs deliver provoking performances. As much as ""Honey Boy"" is tough, it's beautiful and you can't keep your eyes off the screen.

Shia Le'Bouf plays a version of his own father in this autobiographical account of Shia's life as a 12 year old child actor wanting to be loved, and a (ten years later) 22 year old actor with demons. We know where the demons come from. Perhaps Shia wouldn't be where he is today as an actor without the abuse he'd faced in his early years and the 'love' shown by his alcoholic father (and his alcoholic forefathers). I would have liked to have known more about his relationship with his mother and why he didn't love with her - but Shia (who wrote the film) no doubt has his own reasons for not going into that. No, this film was about him and his dad, and the unconditional love that manifests, in spite of everything. I held it all together during the film, but the inevitable floods of tears came down as the credits rolled. Shia has, no doubt, had a chequered past, and maybe this film is his attempt at some redemption.

48,CabbageCustard,A movie that says a lot on a lot of levels,7,29 January 2020,"Honey Boy is not an easy movie to watch. In fact, it is often quite harrowing. Don't expect to come away from this with a warm and fuzzy feeling inside. You won't. You'll probably be angry, horrified, repulsed but maybe even educated.I know that this was written by Shia LeBeouf as a representation, of sorts, of his life growing up as a child actor with an emotionally abusive, egocentric, self-loathing father. All I can say is if this is really what Shia LeBeouf's childhood was like, it's no wonder he grew up to be such a nut case. Why did his mother allow this to happen??? Your heart really goes out to young Otis (i.e. the young LeBeouf) in what he goes through. You can even understand and make allowances for the angry, young substance-abusive man he becomes. In some ways, you even feel for the abusive father. You realise his pain, which he projects onto his son, was the result of someone damaging him. It is all so sad. All young Otis wants is for his father to love and care for him. Sadly, his father is just incapable of doing that.This movie says a lot about fathers and the importance of the relationship they have with their sons. There is a powerful message here.I have never liked Shia LeBeouf as an actor. I didn't mind him when he was younger. I saw him for the first time in 'Holes' - a very clever family movie - and was impressed. Sadly, that youthful promise came to nothing and Shia grew into a very mannered and and, for me, unnatural and irritating actor. In fact, if I saw his name in the cast of a movie I would give the movie a big miss. I'll probably do the same in the future. I have to say though, he acts up a storm in this. All his irritating acting quirks are perfectly suited to the role of Otis' father. It probably helps that though that in playing his father he is also playing himself. Noah Jupe is fantastic as young Otis. What a gifted young actor he is! He is totally natural and believable in this. He will make your heart break. Lucas Hedges is also good as the older Otis, though his role isn't as big as Noah Jupe's or Shia LeBeouf's. Even the actors in minor roles are good.Do I recommend this film? Yes I do.

Most films nowadays try to explore these harsh realities but bail at the last minute to appeal to a broader audience, but Honey Boy bravely tackles its niche subject with raw intensity and doesn't hold back. It doesn't go to an extreme length like Joker. It's enough of a short, straightforward and powerful therapy to recommend to those with similar experiences.

In ""Honey Boy"", Shia himself plays the role of his own abusive father. Perhaps, bringing out his story in front of everyone will help him to fully heal, and move on and move ahead in his personal and professional life. Shia is definitely still very much capable of doing further memorable and brilliant roles as an actor. I hope all producers and directors realize this fact about him.

""Introducing"" preceded LeBeouf's screen credit, but the relatively unknown actor, already an industry veteran with small parts and guest shots on thirteen television shows and films, all but guarantee that the child star would make the successful transition into adult roles, after ""Holes"" grossed $67.4 million domestic($71.4 worldwide). This is no small feat. Look at Haley Joel Osment, who held his own opposite Bruce Willis and moreso, in M. Night Shaymalan's ""The Sixth Sense"", arguably, stealing the film away from the A-lister, with an extraordinary performance that seemed at the time, a predictor of great things to come. But Osment is not a vampire; he only wishes, because the industry can be cruel to child actors. Still working, the child prodigy exists on the margins; the calls from Steven Spielberg and other A-list filmmakers came to a sudden end. Osment finds himself on the outside looking in, a has-been, at an age when most actors hit their stride. Nobody refers to the ""I see dead people"" kid as a movie star anymore, not since the 2003 flop ""Secondhand Lions"", directed by Tim Canlies, in which audiences rejected his post-pubescent self. When your voice changes, it has to change the right way. No ""For Your Consideration"" ad appeared in ""Variety"" on Shia LeBeouf's behalf, but despite never having been an Oscar nominee, audiences liked the ""Holes"" star's post-pubescent voice, so much so, when he talked to anthropomorphic cars in the ""Transformers"" franchise, nobody laughed, catapulting the young journeyman's ascension into superstardom. His father must have been proud.A stage father? Have audiences seen this film before? No. The closest antecedent that comes to mind is ""The Marinovich Project"", a documentary film about a father who tries to build the perfect quarterback, which was part of ESPN's ""30 for 30"" series. That's entertainment, too, sports, but ""Robo"" has a fixed skill-set, whereas Shia, in a sense, calls audibles, for each performance. And Shia's father knew, in theory, how to be a chameleon. Rose Havick(Rosalind Russell), a failed diva-turned stage mother, in Mervyn LeRoy's ""Gypsy"", pushes Louise(Natalie Wood), a burlesque performer, while her career was in its infancy, and pushes still, even after the stripper achieves fame and fortune under the stage name Gypsy Rose Lee. It's not hard to imagine Michael Bay having to ban James Lort(Shia LeBeouf) from the set of ""Transformers"" for being obnoxious to the cast and crew. ""Honey Boy"", perhaps, the granddaddy of vanity projects, directed by Alma Har'el, exists because LeBeouf knows he owes his father a debt of gratitude, while simultaneously chastising him for the method that got him there: Hollywood, the land of dreams. Hollywood can also be the land of broken dreams, especially for guys like James, who from the very start, lived vicariously through Otis(Noah Jupe) when he was still a moderately popular child actor. The audience sees how James uses his son's fame to chase after women, going so far as ignoring Otis while he's in the middle of acquiring a woman's phone number. He knows it and she knows he knows it. Being a successful pick-up artist is contingent on James being the father of the show's star she works on. Away from the studio lot, he's a nobody. Another woman, identified as Shy Girl(FKA Twigs), who lives across from their cheap one-storied apartment complex, always seen in the same folding chair, blows off the father, but takes a special interest in Otis despite being underaged, and starts an undefinable relationship, not so dissimilar as the one between Pierre(Hardy Kruger) and Francoise(Patricia Gozo) in Serge Bourguigon's ""Sundays and Cybele"". Both Otis and Francoise search for parental love that their own fathers are stingy with, but receive a love, otherwise, that almost, but never crosses the boundary line.Fame is a powerful drug. People bask in the afterglow of stars. If Otis was older, she would sleep with him, just for being on daytime television. Poolside, Shy Boy gives the boy his first kiss; nothing scandalous, but not quite appropriate, either. They're two lonely people who carve out a space where the rule of law ceases to exist. James caresses her neck, nothing more; no first base. Some describe the character that pop singer FKA Twigs as a sex worker, since Otis hands Shy Girl some money before he leaves her apartment. In my opinion, it's just a reminder to the audience that Otis is no ordinary preteen; he has the power, a star, not the young woman, a **********. Without being fully conscious of his actions, Otis flexes his entitlement, which we can see more clearly in Otis, the man, who expects special treatment at the rehab clinic, following his third DUI. The relationship between Otis and his father deceives, too. James is on his kid's payroll; he's an employee. The father intermittently gives Otis the star treatment, allowing his son to smoke cigarette, and gives him trauma, brought upon by physical and verbal abuse that will lead to psychiatric treatment as an adult. In one scene, acting on the advice of his doctor(Martin Starr), he lets out a primal scream in the woods. So many things to scream about. Sure, James expressed unabashed outrage towards Shy Girl at the possibility of intimacy being experienced by his son from an older woman, but it's an anger born from jealousy, not abject horror. James should be fired. The kid can hire another acting coach, but as fathers go, this drug-addled narcissist is all that he's got. ""You're in,"" the father tells Otis, adding, ""You made it,"" with barely-concealed bitterness. The failed actor is an updated version of Rose Hovick, who at the end of ""Gypsy"", stands alone on an empty stage looking outwards toward empty seats, wishing they were filled by smiling faces attached to bodies rising up, tingling from her extraordinary way with song and dance. The film industry had no place for James, so he ended up being a rodeo clown. Otis is his second chance. To work with the kid, the show's producer knows it's a package deal; you get the scene-stealing father, too, after the director yells ""cut!"" The failed actor knows Otis has talent, so he uses the cachet of his son's sought-afterness as leverage to behave badly. Nobody on the set believes for a moment that James cares if the director is breaking child labor laws when the shooting goes into overtime. Acting like a big-shot, James loudly storms off the soundstage, carrying Otis in-tow, over his shoulder, with theatrical indignation, in regard to the welfare of his son. ""I just wanted to be noticed,"" Rose tells his daughter in ""Gypsy"". James just wants to be noticed.As Stanley Yelnats, Shia LeBeouf's character takes a shining to Hector Zeroni(Khleo Thomas), the youngest prisoner at Camp Green Lake, in ""Holes"". Stanley goes off searching for the kid after he escapes, since the people who run the sham detention center could care less if the child lives or dies in the desert heat. He becomes Hector's father figure. When they're released, the Yelnats take him in, for the time being, until they locate his long-lost mother. The character of Stanley Yelnats calls for the actor who plays him, to internalize the paternal. Real-life experiences, perhaps, found its way into Shia LeBeouf's star-making performance, acting like the father of his dreams as a riposte to this nightmare dad.""Make me look good,"" James tells his son, as an adult, while riding on two wheels. ""Honey Boy"" tries, as Shia LeBeouf tries, to forgive.",Honey Boy

I've been a fan of Shia's for many moons, he manages to transcend even himself with this. A testament to his tortured talent. Out of the strong came forth sweetness. I love the decision to present the story as a dyad; a very powerful juxtaposition. Exceptional performances by all involved, including Henrietta the Daredevil Chicken, whose performance is anything but fowl. Stand-out acting by Noah Jupe, Lucas Hedges, FKA Twigs, Martin Starr (he's always great), and, of course, Shia (he tricked his father into signing off on this film by telling him that Mel Gibson would play him!). Kudos too to Alma Har'el who directs with a poet's heart and a painter's peeled, unflinching eye. Oftentimes, the greatest strength comes from vulnerability. This film conveys that beautiful truth with flying colors. Watch this, then watch American Honey, another spectacular, cinematic example of Shia at his finest.",Honey Boy
63,Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews,Honey Boy's Got Some Daddy Issues,8,7 January 2020,"The Stream: Too self-referential for its own good.The Big Screen: Great chemistry between the two lead actors.The Final Bill: Almost like reading someone's diary that you don't really care about - intriguing but unsatisfying.-Trip FontaineFirst, I was tempted to title this review ""Honey Boy Don't Care,"" but Honey Boy do care.Yes, friends, we saw ""the Shia LaBeouf movie"", Honey Boy, this weekend. It has been marketed as ""the Shia LaBeouf movie"", and it plays like that in more than one way. Honey Boy is a fictionalized account of the life of the former child star struggling in rehab and his memory of working as a 12-year-old and being chaperoned by his unreliable, abusive, felon and recovering addict father. The film was written by LaBeouf through his most recent rehab stay; and it is directed by Alma Har'el. Necessarily, there is a meta-fictional aspect to the plot, and it becomes too self-referential for its own good.Honey Boy sets the main character, played by Lucas Hedges, off on his destructive road to the rehab that will force him to deal with the effects of his time with his father. Hedges plays the 22-year-old LaBeouf surrogate named Otis that leads us to the meat of the movie. Noah Jupe plays the 12-year-old Otis, and LaBeouf, himself, plays the fictionalized version of his own father named James. Setting aside all of the self-referential, self-consciously, metafictional stuff, Jupe and LaBeouf are fantastic together. Jupe is heartbreaking in the role, at once loving and fearing his father. The relationship between father and son is fraught and heavy - each scene between the two is electric. LaBeouf is mesmerizing both because his portrayal is great, but also, because you know he's channeling the character from real life experience. He expresses the damage, rage and empathy he must have been able to find in his father.Now, what makes LaBeouf's performance so good is also what makes some of the movie feel empty. The Lucas Hedges parts are supposed to be the raw portrayal of the consequences of the Jupe/LaBeouf parts of the film, but they fall flat. You always want more of Jupe and LaBeouf as their characters playing off each other. Hedges' portray is one note and his rehab scenes aren't particularly interesting.There are some great sequences aside from that. The direction of Alma Har'el shows that she cares about all these characters. FKA Twigs has a special part that leads to a cool scene between her and Jupe. They're just filled with innocence and fun. It very tender.Honey Boy plays best when it's just grappling with the tension between the demons of the father and the needs of the son. It is difficult to put aside the specter of Shia LaBeouf when he's front-and-center for much of the movie, but that somehow seems to mostly affect the parts concerning the 22-year-old. If you don't care about his journey in rehab, then those parts of the movie just don't work. While I think that Honey Boy is a good movie particularly because of Shia LaBeouf and Noah Jupe, a trip to the theater isn't warranted.",Honey Boy

It is time to eradicate the erroneous ""Shia can't act"" or ""he's a joke"" claims. The guy is an immensely underrated talent and he more then proved that with his creation of ""Honey Boy"".

66,Abranth-d,You will never look at Even Stevens the same way again.,10,14 July 2020,"Here's my review of Honey Boy. So Honey boy is directed by Alma Hal'er and is written by Shia labeouf . The movie is loosely based off of Labeouf's life as a child actor. The story takes place while labeouf is in rehab while calling back to his childhood through flashbacks. Now what this movie is about , is the relationship between Shia Labeouf and his Father. And the best part about it is , Labeouf plays his father in the movie , and I thought that was brilliant ! Cause Labeouf plays this abusive , eccentric , unpredictable and distant father of his , so when you feel terrified for the kid playing younger Shia over his father's actions , you realise that the man who's playing his father was the kid himself , that just made this movie much more layered . The kid who played younger Shia was also really good and had great chemistry with his onscreen dad . The majority of Shia's childhood flashbacks are during his early years on the sets of Even Stevens. For those of you who don't know , Even Stevens was a popular Disney Channel Sitcom in the early 2000s and Shia Labeouf starred in it as a child star and then rose to fame. So yeah , the flashbacks show Shia's father as his chaufer who drives him around from the tv set to a little motel where they stay. If you were someone who watched Even Stevens growing up , you might never look at that show the same way again , cause you might've imagined all these Disney kids having great lives outside their sitcoms , and most of them really did , but not Labeouf . This guy was troubled and all he wanted was to connect with his cold and distant father and there are scenes of Shia rehearsing is lines and the way his father helps him through it is heartbreaking . The movie is shot like and pretty much is an Indie movie , and that got me thinking , how great would a Shia Labeouf biopic be , if it was a mainstream Hollywood blockbuster like the wolf of Wall Street. And then I read somewhere online that the director said this movie is ""definitely not a biopic"" , and it makes perfect sense. Cause if it was a biopic , it would overshadow the father and son relationship , which again is the heart of this movie. My only gripes were how the music wasn't amplified to suit certain scenes in the movie , and that's just about it. Other than that , I thought HoneyBoy was a simple story with complex characters , Shia's amazing yet layered performance and the most realistic behind the scenes Disney Channel Could not offer.",Honey Boy
67,Bek204,A very slow and boring movie that Shia LeBeouf's acting saved it.,6,27 July 2020,"Honey Boy was one of the movies that I was really really looking forward to it, especially after I read some of the reviews and watched the trailer that made me more excited to see it, but after I saw it, I was so disappointed.Honey Boy is such a slow, cold, and boring movie that you might sleep while watching it. Nothing grabbed my attention or made me connect to the dramatic and emotional story at all other than the last 30 mins.The last 30 mins saved the whole movie, the only reason I gave it a 6/10 is because of the last 30 mins, other than that I would've given it a 4/10. These 30 mins had such powerful and dramatic scenes that were so emotional with a great acting performance by both Shia LeBeouf and Noah Jupe that ill talk more about.The directing was really bad, the cinematography and colors were good, loved that purple light that was in some of the scenes and how it represents the emotional feelings. The production design was pretty cool, that little motel or whatever that they were living in looked pretty amazing and did represent their shit life, that swimming pool too was an amazing touch, costume designs were also okay not great but not bad at the same time.For those who don't know, Honey Boy is based on Shia LeBeouf's life specifically when he was shooting Disney's comedy series: ""Even Stevens"", and that explains why the movies had many references to that show. The movie also speaks about Shia LeBeouf's relationship with his dad (Played by Shia LeBeouf himself) and that part was so creative, Shia LeBeouf's dad is played by Shia LeBeouf and I think that's what made his acting performance so great, he really did ""personify"" that character so well, wasn't gonna be surprised if he was nominated for an Oscar or a Golden Globe, I think because of Shia LeBeouf, the movie is really good, he saved the movie. And let's not forget Noah Jupe his a real talent and gave us a good performance.Honey Boy could have been a real masterpiece especially that it had some powerful and emotional scenes, the movie is just 1h 34 min and felt like I was stuck in a deep hole or something and struggling to get out of it, can't imagine what would it be if it was 2h or something, I don't even want to imagine it.My rating is: 6/10",Honey Boy

69,huntersmithx,Unexpected and moving,9,21 December 2019,"Shia LaBeouf is one of the most complicated and fascinating filmmakers in the Indie film scene today. In spite of a controversial background and history of legal troubles, he manages to soldier on and impress critics and film buffs (myself included) in versatile roles. ""Honey Boy"" is Shia's coming to terms with his traumatic childhood in cinematic form.The protagonist here based on Shia- Otis, played brilliantly by both Lucas Hedges and Noah Jupe, while LaBeouf plays James, a version of his own father. The story around them here is original and relatable as I came to like and (mostly) hate the troubled relationship between Noah and his father as they attempt to make something out of Noah's up and coming Hollywood career.This film is hard to watch at times and can be somewhat meandering; yet it's profound and could mean more for Mr. LaBeouf's potentially upward career.

70,popcolin,Entertainment factor missing,4,8 February 2020,"I feel like this movie could have been super entertaining. With a name like Honey Boy and a poster of a boy with a pie in the face this movie seems real interesting. It's about the turbulent life and relationship between rising star Shia and his father? Great! But then you watch it, rather you slog through its 90 minute running time waiting for something to happen, some excitement like a pie in the face. And while this does happen, as do a number of ""behind the scenes"" moments, the film never rises to any height of seeing over the fence in the crappy motel that takes up 90% of the movie, you will not rise up to see anything much over the backlot fence, nothing more than a few brief ""mentions"" of the entertainment and fame that Shia has lived through. That's what I want to see and while I understand this is more of a heartfelt movie about pain and suffering, the filmmakers need to understand no one is going to recommend this movie to anyone because it is so depressing and boring, and repetitive, repetitive, so repetitive. There really needs to be more scenes of the positives to balance it out, because other than one half-scene with adult Shia in front of ""Transformers"" camera, instantly we are thrown in with him into the rehab facility where I certainly cannot sympathize with anyone there, back and forth back and forth with little to no meaning with any of the scenes in either timeline. And it seems as though each timeline only progresses maybe a few weeks time, so where is the rest? Why show such a narrow viewpoint of a few days in the life of one man separated by 20 years? There needs to be more connecting scenes, orherwise it just leads us down a hallway that abruptly ends. The funk of stale cigarettes on the breath of a 12 year old kid is ultimately what this movie boils down to. It just had no entertainment factor whatsoever and that is what would have really saved this movie. I don't know how true it is but I read that Shia wanted Mel Gibson to play the role of the father Shia ended up playing himself. Already that is a much more entertaining movie. I'd probably watch that twice because while Shia did not do a bad job he is certainly not the force that role deserved, since that seems to be the point of the movie. I watched it once super excited, already making plans to watch it a second time with my girlfriend but now I just wanna forget about the movie and the sad state of affairs Shia wants to remind us of, the couple of weeks he spent in the hotel trying to give his father a chance, then after the third (the third?!?!) time he gets a DUI and is put in a fancy rehab facility, but alas, no he does not want to let us know of his happy moments, the years and years of fame mean very little when we just have all this pain to sort out.

76,kaneeddy,"Strong performances and writing, a good film",7,15 June 2020,"Honey Boy is a film I was fascinated by, with the way it was made and the subject matter behind it. The story of a young Shia Labeouf and the relationship with his father influencing him as an adult. The performances from Noah Jupe, Lucas Hedges and Shia Labeouf are fantastic, all giving committed performances that will draw out emotions, the direction from Alma Har'el was solid as well as Labeoufs writing, as it felt personal and gave us a glimpse into his life that he didn't need to show us, so I commend him on being brave enough to do that.However, I did see some flaws with the film that didn't quite hook me into it as much as I wanted, its strange but I think showing us real authenticity at times doesn't translate well into films and it felt like that here at times. I also wanted to connect to the characters in the film more but I just couldn't, I wanted to see more from his time in rehab as I thought Lucas Hedges was amazing in his role and I wanted to see more. The 3rd act felt rushed and seemed like it needed an extra 15 minutes to wrap up the plot lines it created nicely.Overall, Honey Boy is a good film with some great performances and some brave writing from Shia Labeouf, I just didn't connect with it as much as I would have liked with a rushed 3rd act made me not sing its praises, I do recommend audiences watch this film as it gives you a glimpse of what a childhood celebrity's life can be like, which is definitely fascinating and worth the watch on that alone.",Honey Boy

Shia really left himself vulnerable on writing this script and I salute him for that.

I am always disappointed because I work so hard and it's hard to get a paying acting job when other actors seem to get arrested and drink and do drugs and are constantly getting hired. However, his performance in Peanut Butter Falcon gave me a new window into his ability as an actor and this movie gave me newfound respect for him and hearing him speak of the film and the process really resonated with me as an actor. I never had a parent pushing me to do it and always felt alone in the business but the character of Otis has a father pushing him and he is as alone and broken as ever.

86,cledakling,Almost unbearable to watch,5,9 February 2020,"Shia LaBeuof should have been nominated for an Oscar for the portrayal of his own incredibly abusive father (who is still alive). But the odd and occasionally confusing story telling, coupled with the fact that it is easily seen as a vanity project keeps it from acceptance. All of the performances are superior to most of what's nominated; but it still doesn't make for a good movie. It is so relentlessly dreary. And it's hard to imagine that if the dad was that bad that his child would have a career and not me in jail.",Honey Boy
87,decarloj,Disappointed,5,7 February 2020,"Let me just start with the good and why I gave this a 5. The performances were great. This was probably the best performance of Shia's career, and he should've been nominated for an Oscar.Now the bad. I was expecting a movie that showed how a troubled actor came to be troubled by growing up a child star. Instead, we got a movie about Jeffrey LaBeouf, a junkie child abuser who wasn't interesting enough and certainly didn't deserve to have a movie made about him. They had a young female black character in one of the films larger roles. But we really knew nothing about her so didn't really care about the character. Lucas Hedges is a fine actor and wish they did more with his character, which had zero development. He started the movie an angry person and remained that way up until the end.So all in all I can see why this movie didn't get that much recognition. It was a good first try for Shia, but if he writes another screenplay he needs to write characters that the audience can root for.",Honey Boy

I loved how open it was and how shia was able to use his own rehab experiences to convey the damage his character ""otis"" goes through, and the work he has to do to understand his behaviours and take responsibility for his recovery. It's such a brutal, funny, touching and sad portrayal of his childhood and I loved it.

92,Joetampa90,Why? Nothing Worth Seeing.,4,8 December 2019,"I've finished Honey Boy and have no idea why Shia LaBeouf felt the need to share this fairly uninteresting personal story. Hats off to him for writing and acting in this because it couldn't have been easy. But I have to ask why? Why did he think this story was unique or interesting enough to force an audience to endure it. The film is a straight forward biography. Shia played by Lucas Hedge's enters rehab at age 22, he's an out of control confrontational asshole. I think then he begins to reflect on his childhood at age 12 or they just splice it together this way it's never fully explained. Most of the film takes place when Shia playing his father a sex offender, alcoholic, child-abusing scum bag. While Noah Jupe plays 12-year-old Shia.Honey Boy is, for the most part, various degrees of child abuse taking place mostly in a motel, with the occasional scene of older Shia in rehab being a total dick. Let me say, I would consider myself a mild Shia LaBeouf fan, I certainly appreciate a decent portion of his acting work. Now let me say, I did not give a crap about what was happening. I was never given a reason to care. The film had next to no depth. It's just scene after scene of Father being utterly horrible to son. There is a tiny bit of other stuff thrown in like boy Shia making a friend at the motel, but it's brief and never fleshed out. Once again there is no reason to care.The best thing about Honey Boy is LaBeouf's performance, which is very strong. Jupe does a great job. Hedges's acting always felt a bit off to me in this work. Honey Boy feels like this film has no reason to exist. It brings nothing new to the slice of life sub-genre, It does not seem to bring with it any kind of deep message, and there is nothing special going on as far as cinematography or direction. I would say Shia was being a bit pompous to think that this was a story that needed a feature-length film to be told. I would recommend passing on watching this unless you are a super fan of Shia.",Honey Boy

The parents are separated and living in LA, and the child gets a job acting in a tv series. The child not really looked after, and father belittles, shames, humiliates, bullies, bashes his son. Like most kids raised by a narcissist, the boy loves his dad, tries to please his father. As an only child, the boy falls into roles to supply his narcissistic dad's needs. The hero projected role, the golden child ""star"", laying the golden egg and providing income. And perhaps more tragic the role of a lifetime, the scapegoat kid. Dad shames his son sadistically. Trauma in a person over time, considered in isolation from the context, looks like personality. Trauma in a family, over time, considered in isolation from the context, looks like family traits. Trauma in people, over time, considered in isolation from the context, looks like culture. A scapegoating, punch down, suck up story about a child bullied at home, who becomes a Hollywood star.

99,niels2765,Shia Labeouf's passion project is brilliant!,9,9 February 2020,"Honey Boy is a 2019 drama, directed by Alma Har'el and written by Shia Labeouf. The film was written by Shia Labeouf while he was in Rehab, after discovering he was suffering from PTSD.Honey Boy is Shia Labeouf's passion project, it's a semi-autobiography on Labeouf's life, and you can see the true soul put into the film by Labeouf, which I truly admire. The performances in the film are outstanding, even by Noah Jupe, who plays a younger version of a character based on Labeouf. Shia Labeouf himself plays James Lort, who is based on his father which must've been a struggle, seeing how broken his relationship with his father was. Shia Labeouf gives an Oscar-worthy performance (even though I HATE The Oscars and I shouldn't care about it at all but for some reason I do).Honey Boy takes many creative risks, especially with the use of the handheld shots and flares. There is a very distinct colour palette of Honey Boy. These creative choices could easily passed off as pretentious, yet it feels so egoless, which is fantastic for Labeouf, who is infamous for his large ego. The film makes me respect Labeouf as an artist so much more.I may like this film more than others due to my pure admiration for Labeouf's work and his vision. The film has a completely new take on the coming of age genre, and is a genuinely powerful film.",Honey Boy

It is extremely humane and deeply discomforting. It is a difficult watch but a transformative film.Despite Shia Lebeouf's dysfunctions in his own life, it is definitely his most gut-wringing performance. He plays his own father. There's an honest heart in Lebeouf's own script.

Firstly how astonishingly brave! To write your true story like this, to explore its depths and reveal its bleak realities without flinching, how astonishing!
This is the story of Shia's father, more than of Shia himself. Shias Dad was a flawed man, failing in his relationships and in his life, but mostly failing as a father. But throughout, though we witness this we also feel an intense sense of his tragedy. I was doubly moved because Shia himself played his father, and it is a wondrous performance. Its ironies are not lost, because Shia was the victim of his father's irrationalities, but one feels throughout the film a desire to reconcile the child to the man. Its beautiful.
I cannot imagine how difficult it must have been for Shia to put himself in his father's shoes. But he does it, and does so with heart. He doesn't make his father a monster, he renders him as a man who longs for something more in his life and this performance must be a gift that shia gives to his father because he shows him that he understands.
I would love for Shia to write more. he is a sensitive man, we need such courageous artists now and I wonder what else he can bring to enthrall us.",Honey Boy

106,jwvandegronden-1,Just watch it for the kid and it will be time well spent!,10,19 September 2020,"Noah Jupe is amazing. Shia LaBeouf Is incredible, but the kid is mesmerizing! I really don't want to sell short the current older version of him, Lucas Hedges. As the vessel for the traumatic experiences of his younger self he had to play the canvas, the backdrop against which the story could unfold. But man, that kid, now still only 15, is the dark matter of the movie.Shia LaBeouf wrote this autobiographical work and played his own father, the reason why he got in that dark place to begin with, so I can't even begin to fathom what this must have done to him, and quite possibly and more importantly, for him, emotionally. And to go through that and being able to deliver a movie of this intensity, this level of reality and honesty towards his inner demons, must have been the spirit that haunted all the other actors. Shia LaBeouf created a masterpiece, and his work gave Noah wings. But the kid (sorry kid calling you kid, but you were, and still are) still had to do the flying all by himself, while the owner of those demons was watching, and judging. As an artist, more than a human being I reckon as that is what happens when you deep dive into a creative process. And that is possibly even potentially worse to deal with because you now are being judged on both your humanity and your professionalism as an actor, by someone go could overstep his boundaries and still operate well within his as he might act as judge, jury and executioner and still be well within his right from a creative process point of view.it would play out badly for the movie if you wouldn't trust the actors you hired for the job but this would be a uphill battle for anyone! Yet Shia LaBeouf focused solely on his own part and played off against the kid like he has been a pro for centuries.

The characters were 2 dimensional and offered little understanding into the causes for their behaviors beyond the obvious common triggers in life. The characters did not reveal any deeper understanding of their mental condition as the movie progressed. It was just the same scene over and over again.
The flashbacks offered no juxtaposition for the viewer to gain an understanding of the characters declines and any improvements that may have occoured. If anything, you are left wondering what the heck happened between the 12 year old and the adult.

110,mike_diamond,Finding the love and humour in therapy,8,13 June 2020,"Written by Shia LaBeouf, Honey Boy is the semi-autobiographical output of LaBeouf's time in rehab grappling with the trauma induced by his emotionally abusive father. Building on a well-rounded script and top tier acting, director Alma Har'el brings a creative construct to the film that breaths life into LaBeouf's project. Split into two timelines, Noah Jupe is incredible as Otis, the 12 year old version of LaBeouf, living in a crappy motel, reciting lines with his gaslighting father, James, at all hours. Lucas Hedges, one of the most promising young actors in Hollywood, plays the adult version of Otis in the rehab timeline, trying to reconcile the skills that James has imparted with the abusive nature of his neglect. LaBeouf plays the role of his own father in both timelines, giving him the opportunity to dig deeply into the source of his pain and empathetically, into the source of his father's. It's a brave project and revelatory in its brutal honesty. Neither self-pitying nor castigating, Honey Boy is a celebration of the therapeutic power of writing.",Honey Boy

118,JRodFilms,Honey Boy (2019),7,12 December 2019,"Honey Boy, starring Shia Lebouf, is supposed to be about the life of Shia Lebouf as a child actor and the relationship he has with his father, who is managing his career.The movie begins on a film set with Lucas Hedges portraying main character Otis, in the year 2005 - he gets into some trouble and is admitted into a rehab facility, where they diagnose him as having symptoms of PTSD. Otis begins having flashbacks of himself as a child actor 10 years prior, set in 1995.The main focus of the film is the relationship Child Otis played by Noah Jupe and his father played by Shia Lebouf. Otis and his father live in a dingy motel looking apartment complex, where their neighbors sit outside their porch till all hours of the night, and Otis develops a friendship with the character known as Shy Girl who is played by singer FKA Twigs.It wasn't exactly mentioned if Shy Girl is a prostitute or not, but that's the impression I got. Otis sees Shy Girl being verbally abused by probably her female pimp, and then have a really intimate scene where they get really close together on a bed and share a kiss on the cheek. It's honestly one of the most intense scenes in the film, and although it may be awkward at times, I think the scene works.Honey Boy is essentially a two man show between Otis and his father. The beginning kind of starts out humorous although cruel where his father comments on his sons urinating skills, but as the film goes on, we dive deeper into the father's jealousy of Otis relationship with his step father Tony, who Otis father lures him to Otis only to beat him up and throw him in a pool.Otis relationship with his father is abusive but its also mature, with Otis cursing at his father and smoking cigarettes with him, and eventually confronting each others insecurities.Meanwhile back at the rehab center, adult Otis grows frustrated applying the rehab cliches to his life. He acts like a brat for most of his stay there but who can blame him. His roommate ticks Otis off by enjoying his time at the rehab. Its not until Otis does the cliché go yell in the woods, that he does get his epiphany and begin to battle his demons.Although most of Honey Boy takes place in a dark motel room, its Shia Lebouf and Noah Jupes performances that carry this film. There is a mysterious and intriguing feel to the film, with Shy Girls character and Otis father appearing as a rodeo clown. It lacks exploring more outside of the motel room. There are only a few scenes of Otis working on movies, and they are all shown in the trailers for the film.Still Honey Boy is worth watching for both Shia Leboufs transition in cinema, and for watching up and comer Noah Jupe act along side Shia.

No matter how vulnerable it leave Shia, i am really thankful to him for sharing a piece of him that played a great part in his life.
And Lucas Hedges, Noah Jupe both did justice to their roles. Even Shia Labeouf himself undoubtedly.
Lucas Hedges's rage, that tension resonates his hard work for this role and he immaculately shine just like the co-star Noah Jupe, who you could really see achieving his best through every second's performance.
Shia's underrated, in fact, he's one of the most underrated actor of my generation. I've noticed him after Lawless and this man bring a different, another level of everything that his character requires. From Fury to American Honey to Peanut Butter Falcon to this right here, A Gem For A Movie.
i always thought why Shia seems to be on the edge every time.

132,johnhandsome-32658,Honey Boy is a movie that knows how to breath,10,12 December 2019,"Honey Boy is the autobiographical story of Shia LaBeouf growing up in the outskirts of a suburb somewhere near Los Angeles.It's a careful and thoughtful piece. It's simple, without pretension and still manages to have brilliant use of direction, atmosphere, dialogue, art direction and sound track.Noah Jupe as Shia and Shia as his father have a chemistry that only a father and son can have. While it's a story about an abusive father. It's also a script about a father doing his best and dealing with a child who's a rising star and being told by everyone around him that his father is trash. It's a delicate character study, written in a loving tone. By contrast a movie like Mommy Dearest would appear to be superficial and cartoonish. While the script doesn't demonize the father figure it's also understated with it lens in portraying how James' behavior is affecting his son.There's some especially endearing and complicated scenes with young Shia, (12) and a nearby prostitute in which ironically Shia manifests his own childhood.It's a script that does as much as to consider its antagonist as well as its hero. The film effectively covers both of their pasts and in this case, juxtaposes them within the same frame.See this movie. It's an imaginative and mature movie about self reflection. It's also often both troubling and hilarious.",Honey Boy
133,N1ck-E,(the story is good but the film it's) Slow Torture...,3,4 October 2020,"... due to the pace of the story, the limited skills of more than half of these actors gave, the limited skills the director contains (maybe music videos would be better suited for this director), boring montages, and random scenes, that drag on, of nothingness.The best acting in this entire film is by the kid playing 12 year old Otis and Shia LaBeouf did a good job, too. The worst acting in this film is by the ""actor"" playing adult, ""rehab"" Otis (was it really that hard to find someone good? Or maybe it was the director's amazing skills? smh)There's several scenes that serve little to no purpose in the story (and not just because these scenes have no dialog), that hasn't been made vividly clear, several times already. (It was like watching a student film reel, with at least 30% of it comprised with b-roll of the same droning purpose, nothingness... WHY! It was just too many failed attempts at art house cinematography, with depth & purpose, in a scene)Aside from the crap-specs, this story is quite relatable and honest (while still maintaining hints of the main character's narcissism, loneliness, anger, and partial disconnect from reality and probably people, at times).The story itself is good, and I would have given it a higher rating, but I ended up having to skip though AT LEAST 20 minutes of the film, due the many scenes of nothingness as an illusion for depth in a scene and repeated pointless filler montages.Side Note: (my own personal feelings about 1 character ... not actor.... in particular) idk if this story is precisely accurate about his life with his father, during his childhood. But if just a fraction of it is true to their life, then that man is a piece of trash. I very much dislike this man! I despise adults who are worthless as a human and CHOOSE to have children, instead of being a worthless loser on their own.I felt zero sympathy for the father character. And I'm willing to bet most (if not all) of us has had a person like that in our lives. Unfortunately for Otis, it's an immediate relative.",Honey Boy

136,lindabrown-01437,OSCAR WORTHY ACTING,10,21 July 2020,Noah Jupe is the finest young actor I've seen in a while. Shia LeBeouf playing the role of the father was brilliant. Heartbreakingly beautiful movie.,Honey Boy
137,alanlenihan,A raw and personal insight to LaBeouf's childhood,8,1 March 2020,"This movie provides a very emotional and a very REAL insight into Shia LaBeouf's youth and acting start; providing real intensity.The film provides an indie aesthetic within its cinematography that is both immersive and tense, which also portrays a real sense of warmth with its scenery, imagery and metaphors (such as the chicken and its connection with his father). what I believe is brilliant is that we as the audience will never know the true extent of such metaphors only what we could guess, the only person who will truly understand the symbolism of everything within this movie is LaBeouf himself- he leaves it open to interpretation. its crazy to think it was filmed in just 19 days.the main themes I think this movie tackles well and sets out to bring into public discussion is the impact of a seemingly broken family through multiple scopes. The first being divorce and its impact on a developing child- most clearly shown through the conversation between Otis, his father and his mother over the phone where he relays the abuse both parents are throwing at each other so willingly. The second is mental health and drug abuse problems within adults with convictions and the effect it can have on their job prospects, and ultimately the relationships they have with their children; making them feel utterly useless and like failures,What norm I believe this movie battles the most and I credit the director first and foremost for their skills to portray this in a manner that makes the audience not to feel completely sorry for the childs (Otis) situation but to empower them to break constraints of control given to him by society due to the mere fact of being a child in the eyes of the law. This norm is the assumption of childhood innocence and dependence- you feel that the child is ultimately controlled beyond reason and thus resorts to other forms of compassion given to him by the 'Shy Girl' (FKA Twigs), a reaction you feel necessary for Otis' wellbeing.Now to the acting. Although aesthetically LaBeouf didn't really fit the parent with a teenage son look, due to his youthful face, it was ultimately brushed under the carpet. Due to his real, raw and powerful portrayal of his own father. Imagine the emotion it would take to portray someone who you still love (which he has declared) but had such a testy relationship with because of mental and physical abuse; the epitome of toxicity. He, in my personal opinion couldn't have done it better, and as per usual deserves more recognition and opportunities in drama roles, which seem to be overshadowed by his early works in Even Stevens (2000-2003) and the Transformers franchise; he is a true talent.Noah Jupe, as a child actor is impeccable at his job- the emotion he gives within his performances, in particular this and Wonder (2017) are far beyond his years and will take him far in the industry and provide him with the opportunities he deserves. He truly embodied his character and provides a expressive performance. Lucas Hedges, I loved him in Lady Bird (2017) and Mid90s (2018), and in ways of casting this film was brilliant as the two actors have very similar facial features and expressions. He provided a good portrayal of PTSD caused by childhood trauma and rounded the film off brilliantly with embracing his fathers mistakes but also finds it within himself to accept that at the end of the day nobody's perfect.""I'm gonna make a movie about you"" and he most certainly kept that promise.",Honey Boy

I wanted to reach out and grab him and hold him and tell him it's going to be ok, and I would NEVER let anyone hurt him, ever! I haven't heard anyone say, ""Where the hell was his MOTHER?!"" Maybe they said and I didn't catch it, but she is just as responsible as his despicable father. I can't understand why no one stepped in and stepped for this child? Even the Big Brother guy could have had him arrested and get the mother to come and get him?! Thousands of kids go through the same thing, and it's important for parents to see this and see how it affects their children, but it's just upsetting for most people watching it. I didn't enjoy any of it. This girl taking him out of this for a minute was sweet at first but crossed the line. He needed someone to protect him. To love him and give him kindness and joy and god this made me sad. I am sorry that this happened to him and all of us who didn't have a safe and loving father. The thing is they're our father and it's awful that we feel or that we have to keep them in our lives. As a rule, as the law. It really got to me in a bad way...obviously.

143,GarretCapristo,Portrayed beautifully,8,10 March 2020,"When Shia LeBeouf was in rehab he had plans to make a movie about his childhood and relationship with his dad. As soon as he got out he started working on this movie. Shia LeBeouf took on the role of playing his dad in the movie with Noah Jupe as young Shia LeBeouf and Lucas Hedges as older Shia Lebouf. Shia LeBeouf is portrayed by a young boy named Otis. This movie goes between the perspective of young Otis and older Otis. Shia LeBeouf could've earned an oscar alone just for his acting performance as his father in Honey Boy. Not only did he play the role of his father in a way do get the audience to feel the emotions he's showing towards Otis but he also did a great job directing the movie. He had a great idea where when scenes with older Otis in and out of rehab would go to scenes with young Otis would seem odd or strange showing how his memory is faded or that he doesn't completely remember his childhood. It was a great idea but if you didn't know it prior to watching the movie you would just be confused and think Shia LeBeouf was being lazy or didn't know what he was doing. Besides this, the acting was pretty phenomenal between all the actors. For how young Noah Jupe is, you can really feel a strong relationship between him and Shia Lebouf in the movie. After the movie came out, Shia LeBeouf showed it to his dad and it made him cry. This was there first time talking for years prior to the film. All around if you were watching this movie not knowing much about Shia LeBeouf or anything about his life this may not be the movie for you. Essentially it is a movie about his life as a young actor and can be confusing at some parts. On the other hand, if you love Shia LeBeouf films or him as a human and actor this movie is very interesting. I enjoyed the film but I can see why someone wouldn't want to watch it.",Honey Boy

159,grantiworden,"Three Standout Performances (Labeouf, Hedges, Jupe) Force Audiences to Confront Childhood PTSD 9/10",9,25 November 2019,"One aspect of this heartfelt drama that struct me was the non-linear story telling of Shia Labeouf's script. By choosing two ages (times in Shia's life) to focus on and study, the audience is able to filter their childhood, their trials, their failures or successes through the sad scenes of a child-star living out of motel or a young adult battling the rehab.The film is brave, gritty, and dark. If the discussion of an American, character focused, New Wave of cinema is upon us, ""Honey Boy"" would have to be considered with such films as ""Joker"" or ""Taxi Driver."" Obviously not as violent, but a real contribution to an artist studying his own life, portraying a real character and coming out the other side stronger.The film's rawness can be attributed to Shia Labeouf, Lucas Hedges, and Noah Jupe standout performances. I loved the supporting roles in FKA Twigs and Byron Bowers. These two character's roles stand out instantly because of how alone Noah Jupe (younger Otis) and Lucas Hedges (older Otis) truly are.The longer and intense scenes of dialog between Shia Labeouf and Noah Jupe are the bread and butter of this film. Their performances were incredible. The Between Dad, talent agent, drinking buddy and mentor, the flip-flopping of family dynamic kept you wanting more. I hope Noah Jupe finds a lot of success off of this performance.Thank you Shia, for sharing your story.9/10 rating due to; the story structure, singular locations, pink/blue neon lighting during drug or dream sequences, but most of all for the actor's performances.Dive into the childhood trauma of Shia Labeouf, you won't be sorry, but perhaps thankful.",Honey Boy
160,drjorgeobregon,"Bitter taste, great movie!",8,10 March 2020,"Shia gives us an intimate, personal and uncomfortable work about the story that made the man and actor he is at the moment. Always thought that Shia was a weird man, it is easy to judge someone who ""has everything"" and still have self-destructive attitudes, in this movie, the reasons are clear water, an absent mother and a broken father, consumed by how he conceives himself and by the envy caused by his son's success, something that he never could achieve. Otis, the character that represents the childhood of Shia interpreted beautifully by Lucas Hedges, is a child tormented by living in a dysfunctional family and for not knowing what is to be loved by the people who are supposed to do it. The baseball game scene doing pantomime is probably the cutest moment and at the same time the most heartbreaking in the film. All relationships are difficult and nobody is taught to be a father, behind every broken and abusive father it is very likely that there is another home just as broken and full of abuse. Otis's character as an adult in rehab is diagnosed with PTSD, just like his father when he returned from the war, but, is not worse than a war to live feeling that you are not loved? Excellent work of the director who knew how to keep the essence of the script based on the Le Beouf's recordings during her time at rehab.

I'm grateful I was able to view this movie at the Sundance theater last night. I was too nervous to ask a question during the Q and A session after the movie but wanted to ask if they purposely chose to portray the modeling behavior between son and father. I recently went to a parenting class by @simplyonpurpose where they mentioned that 90% of the time a child is punished for repeating the same behaviors as their parents, only 10% of the time are children actually being disobedient. This movie did a wonderful job portraying that inevitably in a few very powerful scenes. Anyways parenting was obviously on my mind so perhaps I found what I wanted to see. We can't choose our parents or control their behaviors. We can only choose to be better, do better, love deeper and make an effort to model the type of behavior that will benefit our future generations.

175,itsmyrt,Watch it!,9,24 November 2020,"Hey - trainee children analyst here. So in my opinion, Honey Boy is a very unique film for all types of reasons, but most importantly because it atempts to dig deep into one of the most difficult subjects for most people, which is childhood trauma.I'm thinking that when people try to put trauma into art it can easily come out either as an underestimated or over-dramatized, grotesque situation. What is achieved in this movie though (and with the amazing acting from all the cast -especially the boy, I loved him) is a very delicate and sweet but also realistic depiction of the whole history of childhood trauma, including it's formation, embodyment and behavioural consequences. Together with these comes a very down to earth depiction of PTSD therapy, which focuses on the pain, grief and difficulty surrounding the process of confronting one's trauma.The way these elements are passed through in this movie actually leaves the audience wanting to connect the dots of their own childhood experiences and touch their own trauma roots - which is very much needed in these times of generalized emotional disassociation and narcissism. Most probably, I imagine, what gets the audience is not only the thorough analysis of the characters' psychology but also the fact that the whole story is mostly told through the eyes of the child. And anyone can relate to a helpless child - we just usually prefer not to, cause it hurts.So, watch this film, but even if you don't, just start asking children how they feel.

It was meant to be semi-autobiographical..but all of the characters are fictionalized (as stated in the credits)? Yet, there are photos of real people during aforementioned credits..? If it was meant to be a fictionalized, universal story of eventual self-reconciliation, the credits undercut this and confuse the point.

If you're telling a story strongly based on your own story, and you go out of your way to point this out, it no longer feels like a universally approachable journey. Autobiographies that are too self-aware can be off putting and misconstrued as conceited.As a movie, it was fine but there wasn't much depth to most of the characters and there was not much to the story as a whole. The acting and directing worked (I can understand the rave reviews of those aspects) but, the lack of fleshed out characters and plot made the whole ordeal seem stagnate at times. I appreciate how the unreliable narrator made for lighthearted fluff but how much was actual history for Otis and not just cobbled together by blindspots in a fractured adult mind?We don't really get insight as to why child Otis wants to act or if it was even his idea or not; not sure if the father was trying to live vicariously through him and he just, simply appeased him. It leaves a lot to the imagination, which can making viewing this hard. If you don't have a tendency to over-think things, you might be fine. At some points, it did seem like important plot points had been left out or removed while awkward, unnecessary filler was placed in the gaps.In summation: the over-entitled main character is gifted a third chance after an intoxicated police altercation (some people don't get two, some are killed in the altercation before they get one) and then, sent to a detox program rather than jail. He still has the nerve to be pissed off about the situation but begrudgingly goes through the motions. While in rehab, his therapist tells him that he is showing clear signs of having ptsd but does not elaborate on her findings. He is confused and questions this diagnosis so she has him journal childhood memories as therapy. The audience has to weed through his random memories with him. He ultimately forgives his emotionally-withholding father..?(is that what happened or is that what he wished had happened..?)I, personally, am still not sure if the condition was due to the collective events we saw from the past or if something else happened prior or in between..? Based on what is presented to the audience, I would've assumed it was from the car accident. Some events were working cogs in the narrative but others were imagined; the difference was apparent, except when it wasn't. I don't mean to undermine the journey but it got a bit muddled.",Honey Boy
179,atait421,Under appreciated,9,27 June 2020,This movie was fantastic start to end. A tragic but beautiful coming of age story. I've been a fan of Shia for a long time and this might be the top of his game.,Honey Boy
180,talyaerel,would recommend,9,1 October 2020,"You certainly obtain an insight into Shia Laboef's life behind the scenes of his promising acting career. Not only is Honey Boy very elegantly shot, the dim lighting and frequent use of stills really creates a serene atmosphere. I found it hard to take my eyes off the screen, what an enticing movie with a lot of underlying messages. Honey Boy allows for the engagement with the audience as it slowly reveals the realisation that nobodies lives are really what they seem. A somber movie but a movie well worth watching.",Honey Boy
181,lukec327,Very good movie!,8,21 November 2019,"Just came out of the theatre from watching Honey Boy! Very good movie, and such a powerful movie! I personally would go and watch it again!All the actors did amazing throughout the film! Shia surprised me with his outstanding performance. Lucas Hedges and Noah Jupe surpass their level of acting! They both did an outstanding job with their performances!
Noah Jupe does take the cake for his performance in this film! You have to watch it to understand!",Honey Boy
182,kellyadavis2012,Do yourself a favor....WATCH THIS!!!!,10,19 June 2020,"Seeing this young man's struggle all while dealing with my own makes me strangely feel like I know him. Shia, you put your heart in soul in everything you do and I just had to say, I feel it. As a mother, I just want to hug you and as a friend, hang with you. Just one more film blessed by your beautiful soul and not surprisingly, I fell in love again.",Honey Boy
183,nightesprit,At a loss of words.,9,2 March 2020,"This movie was really something else.First of all, I would like to commend the acting of Noah Jupe. It was probably one of the best child performances I've ever seen, and it did not cease to move me. As for Shia LaBeouf, it was unconventionally intriguing how he decided to play a fictionalised version of his father, yet ultimately it served the autobiographical underpinning of the film, as LaBeouf obviously knew his father better than anyone.The cinematography goes from bleak, suiting a run down motel in L.A, to retro, to surreal, which gave feels of illusion and desperation for both James and his son, and added to the film's unique and unprecedented charm.Above all, what you cannot fail to see are the self-aware references LaBeouf has made. First Transformers, undeniably Even Stevens - which was a humorous show in its own right, yet Honey Boy spoke in heavy allusions that there was none of that happening to its lead actor behind set - his childhood friend (whom was directly named), his costar (Megan Fox) and a bit of the actorly self-criticism which was said during his hard days.
Also would be terrible not to mention Lucas Hedges who absolutely nailed the roll of an older Otis and FKA Twigs, whose enigmatic performance really made me question the reality of her character's presence.They were all brilliant. I've seen Honey Boy twice, and I must say, it's unforgettable. Perhaps not a feelgood, and a little saddening, but believe me, take this movie's existence as a happy ending. A way to conclude LaBeouf's chapter of arrests and odd public behavior by coming to terms with his past, and enable a future of better choices and positive self-reflection.",Honey Boy
184,mynameiswood,HONEY 🍯 BOY 👦 IS THE BEST FILM OF 2019!,10,25 November 2019,"Honey Boy is a patient and honest film. From the realness and authenticity in the way Shia LaBeouf plays and writes his father, to the true-to-life complexity of alcoholism. The subject matter never feels poorly handled and the character of James (Ottis's Dad) is anything but two dimensional, especially when tackling the effects of his 'nefarious' actions towards his son. Along with some equally raw performances from Noah Jupe, who I may add is the most convincing 12 year old captured on film ever, as he balances the innocence and edginess that comes with being that age perfectly, making for some really powerful scenes of conflict between father and son. Lucas Hedges, who plays Ottis in his twenties also does a great job, making for some of his best work to date.I couldn't go through reviewing Honey Boy without bigging up Alma Har'el's directing, that compliments Shia LaBeouf's script almost always, with perfectly timed punch ins, dutch angles, and blocking. Natasha Braier's cinematography is mesmerising, through the soft lights and colours,that really capture moments of dreamlike recollections, or childlike wonder, and melancholy.Honey Boy's biggest strength is capturing the complexity of our relationships with our parents, and reminding us that they do indeed love us even if we never see the warmness that we long for so dearly. This is captured from the outside in, rather than the inside out. Through Ottis learning to understand his father's struggles, he can finally come to terms with the trauma he had felt for so long, and alleviate the pain of a false belief that he was never loved.The film works through how deep Shia LaBeouf is willing to go with his truth, allowing for the audience to have an emotional experience unlike any other, even as someone who doesn't share the same experiences as Shia LaBeouf, I was still able to draw similarities, and meaning from Honey Boy.Side Note: Must watch of the year; do yourself a favour and catch this ASAP.",Honey Boy
185,guerrilawarfare,Definitive Oscar Snub of 2020,9,8 February 2020,"Most well acted movie I have seen in 2020. The direction, writing, and cinematography were all amazing. The fact that this is not nominated for a single Oscar is atrocious. How anyone could say Pitt or Hanks put in even close to the effort and performance Shia did is asinine.",Honey Boy
186,aidanbova,A moving and touching story,10,19 May 2019,Honey Boy tells a personal and touching story through dreamy visuals and incredible performances. Such a well crafted piece of narrative art. I highly recommend this film to those who enjoy and appreciate cinema for the beauty that it is.,Honey Boy
187,tschneider-76106,Wow.,10,6 September 2021,Wow. Just wow. Extremely emotional. Very well made. 👏 Shia has alway been one of my favorites. But THIS ..... just made him not only a favorite actor. But now writer as well. I cant wait for more from this amazingly talented person. Thank you Shia for sharing your life with us. This couldn't have been easy to make. ❤,Honey Boy
188,snayer-83285,"Great acting, poorly written.",1,26 July 2020,"The acting on everyone was great. I felt real emotion from then actors. However the movie was written by someone with strong emotional attachments and it is evident and not in a good way. It felt like a bit of a fever dream. Scenes were jumbled, and progression was lacking. The script was clearly written for only the writer, I understand he was getting things off his chest but you need to establish things with the audience and follow some sort structure. The scenes seemed like it is being told by a guy that got drunk at a party and is telling his life story to someone who wasn't really listening. Embellishing here and there and then abruptly just stoping with a chicken and motorcycle. Movie had potential if it was in someone else's hands.",Honey Boy
189,kconi-09824,This movie earns a standing ovation,10,16 July 2020,I loved it so much i watched it three times. Everyones going to love it!,Honey Boy
190,armen-83928,Best movie,10,12 December 2020,Amazing heartfelt movie written by the man himself.,Honey Boy
191,biancalacy,Most touching moving and beautiful movie !!!!,10,9 February 2020,This film brought me tears and touched my heart. They way everyone worked together to make this film was amazing. Shia i love him thought he has always been real and i admire him this movie was defintley from the heart,Honey Boy
192,densba,Am adult performance from a child actor.,9,15 February 2020,Noah Jupe was excellent in this film. He is definitely growing as an actor and can no longer be dismissed as just a child actor.The story was good and Lebeouf did a good job playing the father. I recommend it highly.,Honey Boy
193,grnoni,"2 THUMBS UP to SHIA, CAST, DIRECTOR poignantly writtenMovie.!!",7,6 July 2021,"This is a very good movie. The cast were all FANTASTIC!! Shia's portrayal of his father was one of his BEST ROLES EVER!! I'm certain that was very emotionally hard, to emulate and ""channel"" his father but he was superb! Also, young Otis was also incredible in his portrayal of a 12 yr old ""star"" who didnt quite live as such and screamed for parental, fatherly love and guidance. GREAT WORK and helps mNy of us understand what many child actors go through and the challenges.",Honey Boy
194,danilodiludovico,Great movie. Amazing acting.,8,17 April 2021,Great writing that touchese the right spots. Overall a really great movie. The acting performances are stunning. Shia LaBeouf is perfect throughout the movie. Lucas Edges has consistently been one of the best young actors in the industry for the past few years and It shows. FKA Twigs fit perfectly in the role. But what amazed me was Noah Jupe performance. Wow. I wouldn't be surprised to see him win some awards in the next future.,Honey Boy
195,mccreanordaniel,Shocking,1,31 March 2021,"I can sympathise with FKA Twigs, as I also feel abused after watching this film. A self-indulgent rag tag of excuses to try and make Shia a redeemable character. It fails miserably. He atempt to justify his indefensible actions with this self pitying, woeful tale to try and convince us that he is a good person.",Honey Boy
196,princesslovesyellow,It was good,7,1 June 2021,"I liked the movie but I do have to say, it kinda got confusing for me because of how the scenes are.",Honey Boy
197,marauder800,Boring,5,9 February 2020,One of the most boring movies I've seen in a long time. I watched to the end to see if things would get interesting but they never did.,Honey Boy
198,kb68,Screaming actors,5,10 May 2021,"Unfortunately, the actors scream throughout the film in the typical American unnatural way so it is unbearable. No one will scream that way in reality so it quickly becomes enslaved.",Honey Boy
199,Kris_Pleiko,Unique take on growing up,8,28 September 2020,"This movie, while being very specific take on growing up, still is interesting to watch and heartwarming to feel. It felt like short film because it's runtime literally ran away and felt like 20-30 min movie. However, subjectively it doesn't get 9 or 10 stars from me because it was really narrow view, the same as childs view. It serves the story, but steals from movie as a whole.",Honey Boy
200,indiefilmguy-117-238133,Movie was okay.,5,19 July 2020,Movie was okay but seemed to be mostly Anti-climactic. Many people warned that this movie may be triggering but I don't think any of them know what real abuse is.,Honey Boy
201,pladder_87,Honest and moving,10,22 January 2021,A piece of art that moves you with a story that is told in such a naked and honest way. Sharing your inner like this is a true act of courage and Shia has both written and performed it in a way that is worthy of all praise. Just wow.,Honey Boy
202,two1498-113-258494,Truth hurts.,10,8 November 2019,Mine was the same but he was never there. Chillingly seen self up there in that lol boy. Scared again sad again whole,Honey Boy
203,julietvalli,Beautifully sorrowful,9,18 December 2020,Shia was great in this as he is in everything. He sucks you in and makes you feel the emotions the characters go through. Definitely a fan and definitely should watch when you get a chance. Great movie !,Honey Boy
204,tahinmanjurok,Shia reinvented,7,14 March 2020,"These films are quite rare, in a sense that; you don't find films this heartfelt.I'd always thought LaBeouf was a bit off the rails and that his career was on a downward spiral, after watching this I'm eager for more of his content because he was stellar in this film.Having done more research on the background of this film, I feel I can empathise with this film; you rarely a film so sincere and genuine like this.Noah Jupe is a young actor that's been in a few good main films; such as Le Mans. He does a fantastic role playing young Otis. The on screen dynamic between him and LaBeouf is so wonderfully constructed.",Honey Boy
205,Igor1081,An Oscar worthy depiction of the struggles of a troubled upbringing,10,17 March 2020,"I think this movie was by far one of the most incredible films I've seen in a long time. The level of emotion, honesty, exposition and raw truth was compelling enough to make anyone cry.Shia deserves all of the praise and this movie really paints him in a different light. In a way that is endearing and relatable.Most definitely the most important film he's ever done.",Honey Boy
206,rudygee-68264,Close To Heart Story,10,16 February 2020,"Really loved it great cast for the story and impressive storyline had me looking at my life and being able to connect with my self and gave me an understanding of how life is amd how you are always in the eye of everyone else and if you just do the right things in life and not blame anyone theres always a sunny day the next day so you can make changes in whatever you need to so you never regret what you do in life but if you learn from it you win .So lets see what the sequel ""honey made"" brings after the son realizes how his father kept his secret to his dying day and left the planted seed in him to figure out and now will he make the same errors or will he use his time he had with his life coach to implement in his life? ""Honey Made"" the sequel now hes in the spotlight or is his plant the star ? Family tree .....",Honey Boy
207,juanbossicard,A story to remember.,10,7 November 2019,You gotta love when a movie is build on personal stories and hurt. This movie is a love letter to a dysfunctional father.,Honey Boy
208,angelafoster-76146,Heartbreaker,10,26 January 2021,This movie shows Shia in all his brilliance . Its beautifully done but very sad. It's hard to watch at times because of the complete honesty of the characters . I highly recommend this movie.,Honey Boy
209,christinestone,Great movie,10,11 April 2020,"Brave of Shia to share such a personal & real account of his life. Some of us out there had a traumatic childhood. This will help me heal from my severely messed up childhood through my teenage years.
This movie was outstanding. Wonderful production.",Honey Boy
