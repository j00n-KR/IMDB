0,SnoopyStyle,Robert Rodriguez kids franchise,5,6 January 2021,"Sharkboy and Lavagirl are two of the adult Heroics. All of them are called upon to battle an alien invasion and their superpowered children are gathered at the headquarters. The Heroics are all captured and their children are forced to go on the run from the aliens.I don't want to complain about Robert Rodriguez cashing in on his children's movie franchise but that's what he's doing. One also has to remember that he's doing it for his crew and his people. Nevertheless, these are no longer top level theatrical releases but more akin to those straight-to-DVD sequels to Disney classics. When one rates this on that level, this is actually fine. The kids are generally good. They are child actors of good quality, ethnically diverse, and mostly try-hard. The first half is perfectly fine. The kids are fine. The story is mostly fine. The action is fine for what it is. Some of the kids actually do good action which points to their try-hard child actor status. The movie is pretty good until everybody gets to the spaceship. The reveal really deflates the danger and the stakes of this movie which one does feel more and more on the spaceship even before the reveal. I get that Rodriguez wants to make a point about the real world but the danger needs to be maintained. I think kids will like more especially since they will see themselves in the young leads. Adults will see all the flaws.",We Can Be Heroes
1,nogodnomasters,"Did they just say, ""Aliens?""",5,11 January 2021,"Grown-up super heroes get captured by aliens. Their kids must learn to work together and save the world.For fans of Lava Girl and Shark Boy, this is your film. The acting and plot ranged from bad to horrible. The kids were exceptionally bad, with most having few lines. It is a production kids might like, just didn't have anything for adults like smart kid cartoons sometimes do.",We Can Be Heroes
2,paul_haakonsen,Superhero movie for the entire family...,6,31 December 2020,"I sat down with the family to watch the 2020 movie ""We Can Be Heroes"", and it turned out that it was actually a wholesome fun and enjoyable superhero movie for the entire movie.And yes, this is a superhero movie aimed for the younger audience, so you shouldn't be expecting it to be violent and over-the-top like the superhero movies you get to see from D.C. or Marvel. This is entertainment for the family, meant for having the children alongside you to enjoy the movie.The story is actually good, taking into consideration that the it is a children's movie. The storyline does offer enough of action and suspense to entertain, without tipping the scale and becoming too much. And my 10 year old son definitely enjoyed the movie from start to end.The acting in the movie was good. Again, take into consideration that the script, dialogue and characters - both heroes and villains - are written with a young audience in mind and at heart. And it was definitely fun to watch Pedro Pascal in a movie such as this.Visually, ""We Can Be Heroes"" was actually pleasing on the eyes. Lots of good special effects and CGI. And the superhero powers for the children were actually fun and interesting to witness.If you have children and want to watch a light superhero movie, then ""We Can Be Heroes"" is a good choice, as it proved to be a very children-friendly kind of superhero action movie. We enjoyed it thoroughly as a family here as we sat down to watch it.My rating of ""We Can Be Heroes"" land on a six out of ten stars.",We Can Be Heroes
3,neil-476,Decent superheroes for youngsters,7,16 February 2021,"Earth's superheroes are captured by invading aliens, and it is up to their kids to come to their rescue.Robert Rodrigues does superheros in the same way he did spies in the Spy Kids movies - the kids are very much front and centre. They aren't bad - certainly as good as the material demands. The story is straighforward with a couple of twists which will fool kids but not adults.The special effects and production design are pretty good.",We Can Be Heroes
4,Cineanalyst,Jejune,3,9 January 2021,"Filmmakers who keep recycling this trope that children are smarter than them might be right, because that's a very stupid idea. ""We Can Be Heroes"" is more mollycoddling of underdeveloped humans in that vein. But, hey, if parents want to undermine their authority by raising their offspring on or, worse, subjecting themselves to this garbage, that's their problem. It's a nauseatingly daft Netflix burger in most respects, relying as it does on the supposed cuteness of bad child acting competing with placating adults mugging equally poorly and some ghastly fast-motion effects (and I'm not talking about the rewind and fast-forward twins) to cover up the lack of better stunt choreography or the lack of a bigger budget for CGI. On the latter account, another impoverished superhero flick I saw recently, but on the opposite end of the age spectrum, ""Supervized"" (2019), did the same thing. Not realizing that this is somewhat of a sequel and not merely an excuse to reuse the titular song until after having seen it, I'm also already not looking forward to next checking out another likely poor superhero flick in its predecessor ""The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D"" (2005), also made by the wildly inconsistent Robert Rodriguez. Now knowing this, however, it's interesting to note that they didn't get the same actor for Sharkboy back this time, so the character wears a mask and doesn't speak. It's easily the best performance in the movie.The only reason I don't rate this lower is because of the reflexivity of the TV footage, which make for superhero movies within a superhero movie. The first one has the children watching their parents fighting aliens for the cameras, and this performer-spectator role is reversed for the second act. One of the kids' powers involve drawing, too, while another makes water sculptures that rip-off ""Jaws"" (1975). A neat notion, but nothing particularly interesting is done beyond that. The youngsters make fun of the comic-book tropes that their parents partake in, but only for them in the rest of the movie to continue other clichés. Overall, ""We Can Be Heroes"" is the sort of rubbish where it's a good idea to read a book or do something intellectually engaging afterwards just to make sure your mind hasn't entirely turned to mush.Oh, I almost forgot to mention that there's also a requisite training montage in the middle of the picture, which I suppose goes towards the flick being an extended school allegory and despite the race-against-time plot of the alien invasion. No sense of time with these youngins... or of wasting mine with the movie.",We Can Be Heroes
5,ops-52535,''we dont need...,5,25 December 2020,"Another hero'', at least not for x-mas, and allthough nice and cool effects cinematography (if that words valid to use when its so green/blue or whatever colour of background) and kids that seems to enjoy being in front of a camera its not a film to make the merry go around for the adult viewer, and may be felt like a rollercoaster for children too. it has far too much gaming like features and a terrible amount of verbal hacksawing, just like listening to my son (actually all 3 of them ) when playing against the rest of the world interactively, screaming into the headsetmike, and crushing the fightscene on the screen and i start to wanda...is he sick, sad or just dellusional?...this flick would be a buster 20 years ago, along with spy kids etc, but as a family entertainment it works, but not well enough for a grumpy old man.just a 5 for this heroic try.",We Can Be Heroes
6,cruise01,Cheesy fun but adults may find it boring.,6,5 January 2021,3 out of 5 stars.Robert Rodriguez does another family film involving kids. Like how he did Spy Kids or Shark Boy and Lava girl. Which is a spin off film from that movie. Involving a group of superheroes when they get kidnapped. Its up to there kids to save the day.Plot is cheesy. Direction and humor is cheesy. It does have some fun moments.It does have some decent cast with the adults and children. But performances are forgettable. Visual effects are cheap and iffy. Action is decent. Its a family film that adults may get bored of. But kids may like it.,We Can Be Heroes
7,RosanaBotafogo,"A very cute and engaging story, contagious...",8,8 January 2021,"I was completely in love with the little big heroes, each more cute and captivating than the other, completely in love, and that tiny, cute cute girl, daughter of Lavagirl and Sharkboy, only I think the two should be played by the actors who made them children, a very cute and engaging story, contagious...",We Can Be Heroes
8,subxerogravity,Very cute and very corny but I did have fun watching this made for kids superhero movie,5,31 December 2020,"Was a little unsure if I wanted to watch this. Robert Rodriguez as a director has more hits than misses but in my opinion his attempts to make children's movies are not the best, and putting Shark Boy and Lava Girl in this universe is not helping.What is helping is that Pedro Pascal is a part of the cast. Right now he's 1 for 1 when it comes to 2020s greatest dads (As Baby Yoda's father a hit but as a dad in Wonder Woman 1984 a miss) but I'm putting the odds in Pascal's favor.Like Zoom and Sky High We Can Be Heroes is about the children of superheroes all put in one place. It's not a school like the other movies but a Bunker that they put these kids when their parents are facing a bad guy that might used the kids as leverage, and like the other films, you have that one kid who does not live up to the expectations of their Super human parent (and fully lives up to the cliché of the character).It's very cute. The superhero genre is a genre that favors children yet We Can Be Heroes is actually made for children. Not just because it stars children and centers around their story, but even the adult Superheroes have really cute powers.What I really loved about We Can Be Heroes is that the kids all look like they were having fun and that was contiguous, cause I had fun watching them have fun.Very formulated like a Disney flick and like a Disney flick it knows how to attack the heart.Enjoyable.",We Can Be Heroes
9,DarkVulcan29,Spy Kids meets The Incredibles,8,27 December 2020,"You know what to get from director Robert Rodriguez, when comes to family films, sure ya'll remember the Spy Kids films(2001-2011) and The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl(2005) , so you probably know what to expect here.
Kids whose parents are superheros, are so suddenly force to come together has a team, when there parents are suddenly captured by aliens, who are bent taking over the earth, so they must work together rescue there parents and stop the invasion before it's too late.The kids all really shine well here, and effects also pretty good too. Also some surprises you almost won't see coming, that only film like this can deliver. it's just a fun family film so don't go in expecting greatness, now if you didn't like it that is fine, but expect nothing more or less.",We Can Be Heroes
10,Sergiodave,The kids loved it,7,8 January 2021,"Watched this with 2 young children. Not sure what made me smile more, the look of enjoyment on the kids faces, or reading the reviews of teenager and adults complaining about a movie aimed at the under 10 market. Get a life.",We Can Be Heroes
11,jeremycrimsonfox,A Superhero Rehash Of The First Spy Kids' Plot,3,25 December 2020,"Yeah, seeing this film, I can see the makers recycled the plot of the first Spy Kids (a movie they made in the past) while ripping off elements from the Marvel Cinematic Universe (mainly the first Avengers film, with its alien invasion plot). Three stars for Pedro Pascal, who is the best of the actors, and some of the neat ideas for superpowers (like levitation via voice), but sadly, with CGI that looks like it was from the early 2000's, and a bland story with the villain reveal being a let down, this is something kids would enjoy, but adults would be confused about.",We Can Be Heroes
12,Snootz,This Can Be Fun,6,5 January 2021,"This movie can be fun... if a person will let it. We have to realize this is a KID's film. If one is an ADULT and giving this 1-star... that person may need to question their motives and choice of entertainment. If you hate this kind of fare so much you would label it as ""the worst movie ever""... why watch it in the first place? Just so you can post a scathing review? Seriously.In response to some of these 1-star reviews: there is a difference between a Kid's film and a FAMILY film. Shrek was not a ""Kid's film"". The Incrediles was not a ""Kid's film"". ""Toy Story"" and ""Cars"" were not ""Kid's films"". They were FAMILY films, intended to delight adults and children alike. Kid's films (which this is) is aimed directly at children. Adults should not expect this to be cerebral drama... and certainly not expect scientific reality. ""Over the top"" is somewhat normal for this genre.This film was aimed mainly at kids, though many adults enjoyed the absurdity, comedy and camp just as much as the kids. Were some plot elements ridiculous? Yes. Was the acting over the top? Yes. Was the story line a little goofy? Yes. BY INTENT. It was meant to be absurd, silly, campy, and goofy. They were aiming at a CHILD AUDIENCE.This film contains some pretty decent CGI and set effects. The characters were interesting (if a bit lame... but then, that was a major plot point). The film got a few morals across to the kids: teamwork instead of egos, cooperation instead of arguing. Believe in yourself and work with what you've got. Never give up. Those are all valuable life lessons.I didn't much care for the cliche ""children are smarter than adults and should be ruling the world instead"". Seriously Hollywood, we've been fed that junk food long enough. But then again, look at the mess adults have made of this planet. First time in history we've threatened the planet itself. But the reality is, this internet-addicted, self-focused, ""entertain me!"" generation is unlikely to do any better, and will probably do much worse (if ""civilization"" manages to survive that long).For those who rated this 1 & 2 stars and posted lines such as ""Worst movie ever!""... I have to just shake my head. Do those ""reviewers"" have any idea what the worst movies really are? This doesn't even come close to that puddle of goo. This was better than Batman and Robin. Electra. The X-Men franchise. Superman vs Batman. Catwoman. Wonder Woman 1984. THOSE are the rotten tomatoes ... and even they aren't 1 & 2 star level. Seriously people, save your 1-star ratings for movies that *really* deserve it. If you really can't tell the difference, maybe you should be doing something other than writing lame reviews.For a KID'S MOVIE this was pretty good. It held interest all the way through and it even had some laugh-out-loud moments. Not the best movie ever made (thus my 6-star rating), but it by no means the worst. This movie had a lot going for it. Kids will love it and was goofball enough to give kids-at-heart a chuckle.",We Can Be Heroes
13,legobuilderpro,Sharkboy and lavagirl sequel?,4,27 December 2020,"Directed by the same person who did ""spy kids"" and the first ""sharkboy and lavagirl"" movie.The effects were cheesy looking with maybe one green screen looking scene.The child actors were ok and weird action along with these ""Heroics"" (they are called this), and made-up names.One interesting scene and stupid ending/I guess plot twist.This is more of a hero movie with sharkboy and lavagirl in little scenes than a sequel",We Can Be Heroes
14,hotwheelerd-61843,Super Hero Kid's,8,24 January 2021,"Ok now I watched this Film and it was pretty good for the Family. The Young cast was pretty funny at times and they played there Hero very well. Remember everyone the KIDS IN THIS FILM ARE THE HEROES NOT MOM AND DAD. They are out to save Mom and Dad from the Allies. They did a pretty good job it being there FIRST time saving people. I kind of liked the way it was done. The brother and sister could not stand each other. But they will save each other and work together. Oh and that youngest little girl the water one she was pretty crazy and tuff and will kick your butt. I also licked the Young man with the stretchy neck and arms and legs. And the singing girl was also pretty good as well. At the end when the Kid that didn't help out much. It was Awesome to see all of his power when the other kids believed in him.
Anyways this is a GREAT Family Film and I kind of want to see what happens next.",We Can Be Heroes
15,coreyjdenford,Not very Heroic,4,1 January 2021,"While it maybe a nice homage to David Bowie for making one of his songs as the name of a film. It isn't so nice that Director Robert Rodriguez has yet again fallen into the ""same film pit"" as here it goes into the same styles as Spy Kids and Sharkboy and Lavagirl before it, albeit the second film is worse than this, in pretty much every way, that means We Can Be Heroes is just that little bit more bareable. But only that little bit more. A lot of us at this point are starting to miss the Robert Rodriguez that made The Faculty, From Dusk Till Dawn and even 2005s Sin City, even the Spy Kids version Rodriguez wasn't anywhere near as bad, but we are left to wonder what else is down the road for Rodriguez, as he continues down this slope of 'same old stuff'. Yet there's a light at the end of the tunnel as We Can Be Heroes isn't anywhere near as insufferable as the aforementioned Sharkboy and Lavagirl or the black hole that was Spy Kids: All The Time In The World. As there are moments of storytelling grandeur here (and we use that term loosely) as it feels a bit more original, here we have superhero kids (not so original) taking on aliens who guide them to be better than their parents (that's better), and while it plays out that way for most of the film, the rest is jut stuff we've all seen before from Rodriguez. Instead of feeling Heroic, it feels powerless compared to the likes of Sky High or the many other superhero films out there. In fact if this were to be Sky High, the only thing missing is a giddy Kurt Russell and a fourth wall breaking Linda Carter - oh wait no its not. Let's just say these kids should've just stayed home, and the adults should've done too, no wait everyone who made this should've just not done it. But at least it's something that children can enjoy. 2/5.",We Can Be Heroes
16,faer_kr,A nice family movie,6,25 December 2020,"A teenage heroic adventure movie.
It is about some children of superheroes who have to go save their parents after being captured by an alien invasion, where they discover the power they have.
With the essence of Robert Rodríguez films.
Quality.
Entertaining
Use the same Mini Spy photo.
A mix between ""Mini spies"" and ""Super school of heroes"".
With quite crazy situations, as well as the director's own effects.
Organic jokes and moments of sarcasm.
Talk about the importance of teamwork.

17,Brooklynsmagicmike,This movie really only fits demographic of 10 and under.,4,31 January 2021,"Robert Rodriguez is known for making family oriented movies along the lines of this film that have been great. However this one is just way to kid-friendly and not really anything adults would even be slightly entertained by. Corny jokes, bad action, and terrible acting.Sad part is the visuals in the movie aren't bad and the acting cast is actually great. However the movie itself was just incredibly subpar in my opinion. Again if I asked group of 5-10 year olds though they might tell me its best movie they ever seen and that is exactly the problem. Do yourself a favor put it on for your kids to watch and leave the room.",We Can Be Heroes
18,the_doofy,This is no ZOOM,2,26 December 2020,"The acting was very uninspired from adults to children, but then their dialogue was pretty uninspiredPolitical agenda clearly wriiten into the dialogueI'm trying to figure out why a children's movie is going to have a primary antagonist with that much tanned cleavage lighting up the camera that much, another nice message for childrenU got kids and parents telling one another they love each other in the closing, so I guess the guy responsible for this tripe would figure it would white wash the debacleTwo stars for the constant close up tanned cleavage with the hip swaggeranother disney flop",We Can Be Heroes
19,faithless4734,Cheesy......,9,31 December 2020,"What a wonderful kids show. This is a simple and plain children's show. It is great fun and so fantastic, They do not try to do anything but entertain children and encourage them. Frankly I have no idea why so many of these reviews are so poor. My guess is that these are adults who were expecting an adult aimed kids movie. This is not that, it is a kid aimed kids show. It is not made for parents at all. I love how both of the leaders are unsure and fail at some points, that it is a male and a female. I think it is fantastic that the smallest is the strongest and that the brother sister combo actually act like brother sister and ""fight"" like many siblings. You should absolutely let your kids watch and enjoy this show and set aside all your wishes to have a movie for kids made for adults. Let the kids have their own movie also.",We Can Be Heroes

If you have a family, watch this film, if you're on your own, watch this film, if you fancy an enjoyable Sunday afternoon watch this film. It's not going to win any Oscars, but it's a fun, bright, amusing ride into Superheroes. The perfect way to spend a cold Sunday afternoon, curled up on the sofa.I'm not going to go into the story, just watch it and find out, but you have good guys, bad guys, twists and a whole group of kids who are the offspring of a legendary Superhero group.Actos, such as Priyanka Chopra, Pedro Pascal, Boyd Holbrook and Christian Slater of all people pop up. It's directed by Robert Rodriguez of Desperado, From Dusk to Dawn and Sin City fame, oh yeah and ALL the Spy Kids films, so he has previous! The young actors range from brilliant to a little bit school play but they do carry off their characters and YaYa Gosselin, Lyon Daniels and Vivien Lyra Blair (as the awesome Guppy) stand out.Oh yeah and if you ever watched The Adventures of Shark Boy and Lava Girl back in 2005, this is set in that world and even has Taylor Dooley reprising her role as Lava Girl - Guppy's Mum.Well done Netflix.

26,TheMysteriousReviewer,This Movie Can't Be a Hero,3,13 April 2021,"We Can Be Heroes is a really bland Superhero movie for kids. At first, I thought it was just gonna be a pointless sequel to Sharkboy and Lavagirl. After seeing this myself, this is actually more than just that. This is the kind that doesn't have a purpose to be a superhero movie. The story is very predictable that makes the movie not interesting to watch. The action doesn't work. The characters are either pointless or annoying. And the movie steals some stuff from other films such as Avengers, Aliens, Kung Fu Panda, etc. I'm not gonna lie, the visuals do look better than in Sharkboy and Lavagirl. But that's seriously not saying much. They're now just pretty bad. And the biggest issue that makes this barely a superhero movie, the ending with a horrible twist. You know what, I'm just gonna spoil this movie. The kids were only a second too late to save the world. And so the takeover begins. But it turns out there wasn't any alien invasion. It's all just a training for the kids to become superheroes! I'm not kidding, the alien invasion was all a scheme and the parents were involved with it. And the parents are superheroes. And you know what's funny about this movie? After the ending, I could imagine how the world might feel about the scheme. Think about it. In the beginning of the movie, you can see the satellite destroyed. And there was actually a news scene about a alien invasion. So I can imagine the world would go on a angry mob for the heroes because of the scheme. And because of this, it ultimately makes this movie that cannot be a hero. Just do me a favor and don't watch this film. We know from all these years we've gotten much better superhero movies such as The Dark Knight, Avengers, Gaurdians of the Galaxy, etc. So I recommend watch those if you want to watch a superhero movie. Did Sharkboy and Lavagirl really need a sequel? Judging this barely felt like one, the answer is no.",We Can Be Heroes
27,javiergarcon,It is a perfect 10! Finally a Kids Movie for kids!,10,30 December 2020,"I did not know much when I saw it on Netflix, I was thinking Wonder Women or Guardians of the Galaxy instead I got The Incredibles or Inspector Gadget. It is a well made movie with very expensive rigs! The flying was done well especially being children it is difficult at that age because there brain is not fully developed and they can not see themselves floating or flying so instead they are just having fun and for us it looks like a kid on wires. I really enjoyed these powers that did not make sense and instead it took a real leader to understand those powers and used them to combat the problems as a team. This movie is a great team building movie for kids from ages 4 to 12 years of age especially those that are in sports. I am very pleased to give this a 10 because I have given many movies before a 1 star (Worst Movie ever made ""Open Waters"" a movie for ignorant brainless humans) I really enjoyed this kids movie!

28,moorek,Child's (not pre-teen) Movie... see it as that,6,6 January 2021,"I watched it thinking it would be a kid's movie but did think it might be aimed at pre-teems but it seems aimed at a younger age. I don't think many pre-teen and certainly teens would find it very interesting.PACING. Having said that it is a fun movie that understands its role and moves fast enough that you don't have time to think of the silliness of the plot lines or any individual scene.ACTING. Most of the actors are poor, even the adults, but there are a few that are good. Enough to make up for the bad acting. Having said that most of the child actors are acting at a school theatre level.PLOT. Don't worry about it. The writer's didn't. Just know it is a very simple ode to teamwork and that the children are our generation's savours.TWISTS. Not that you expect much from this type of movie but the kid with the most useless power, and even the adults acknowledge that, has a great role. Also some of the CGI for him was fun.Love the less than subtle reference to the President being Trump like as ""how did he get elected when he can't string two sentences together"". Being alien might be an excuse.As others have said, this is a kid's movie so really they should review it.

30,samratsingraur,We cannot be heroes!,5,25 December 2020,The movie takes you back to the world of sharkboy and lavagirl but fails to be what we expected it to be.

31,PaxD75,Innocence revisited: A film for adults w/younger children.,7,4 January 2021,"Going into this film, I did not expect that this film's target audience were pre-teens and/or adults with younger children. As a result, I received the intro period of the film in a negative way.While watching the film, I took a break and when I returned, my brain adjusted and my expectations became more realistic - I was watching a film for younger audiences.Once I accepted the script for what it was, I found the characters had grown on me (every single character was likable), the story suddenly became relaxing and even touching as it ended. I even found myself laughing at slo-mo (who became my fav character. Poor kid running at top speed - like all the time just to keep up!). Puts a smile on my face even as I write this.I'm not sure how to rate this. I understand that most adult viewers would pass on a film like this. Still, I enjoyed it, liked the characters, the child-safety packaging of the film and especially the innocence of the entire presentation (something we have all lost).To wit, I'm rating this a 7 for adults coming to this film with reasonable expectations. An 8 for adults viewing this with younger children.",We Can Be Heroes

34,ty-jensen,Really lame movie but it's for kids.,2,25 December 2020,"Robert Rodriguez made his first shared universe with Spy Kids and Machete and he made his second with Sharkboy and Lavagirl and We Can Be Heroes. I couldn't get into Sharkboy, I seen parts of it on cable. We Can Be Heroes is really lame not to my surprise.We Can Be Heroes is really for kids, the odd adult should like it. This movie is really cheesy and cliche, you know what's going to happen from beginning to end. There are two twists but they're lazy mainly the last one. This movie is fast paced like most family movies but it's a little too fast so the characters are weak. Don't be excited for Sharkboy or Lavagirl because they're barely in it and Sharkboy doesn't have any lines.The acting is fine, you can tell the kids had fun. The adults were fine, they were just working. Nobody had good or juicy material plus everyone had to work with green screens.The CGI is terrible, it's like early 2000s CGI. Was Rodriguez paying tribute to the old movie? I doubt it. I think most of his movies are mid budget.Overall, We Can Be Heroes is really lame. No, I wasn't in pain. I'm not the target audience, kids will enjoy it. Rodriguez will make another mature movie sooner or later.",We Can Be Heroes
35,verminhater,"Nominated for worst acting, worst script and worst film categories.",2,30 January 2021,Anyone who has had to suffer to watch Nickelodeon or Nick Jr with their kids will understand that all American child actors come off the same production line with the same OTT identical acting style. Here those mannerisms are taken to new lows with caricatures of what are already caricatures. They are aided and abetted by the worst script imaginable that has come off it's own autobot production line.

I think just like everything else the script was also made by a child. If I look at it that way it was a pretty good movie.
The script makes no sense most of the time and so 0/2. The plot setting gets 1/1. The cinematogrphy and direction gets 0.5/2 (for the creative powers) and the cast gets 0/2. However, it was funny watching such a disaster so I will give this movie 0.5/2.",We Can Be Heroes

40,neiljones1981,Typical Rodriguez Fare,6,28 December 2020,"For reasons that are lost to the mists of time, I've ended up sitting through various Rodriguez productions (including the entire Spy Kids series, the later Sharkboy film and then this that was waved at me on Netflix) and to be honest they all blend into one after a while. They're all obviously cheap and cheerful green screen productions with some CGI thrown in for good measure and this appears to be a Rodriguez trend - make them quickly, cheaply and get them ready before the promotions department has woken up. This may have a place in some areas but whether its right for the target audience for younger Rodriguez films is up for debate.So We Can Be Heroes is now available to view on Netflix. Its more straight than Sharkboy was, let's put it that way. I think you need to go into these sort of films with an open mind and be realistic as to what you're going to get out of it. Its not a bad film, its a bit of light hearted fun and you could do far worse. Its a relative unique thing to have somebody like Rodriguez who writes, produces and directs his own films, so if nothing else they're probably closer to the Rodriguez vision than your normal production cycle of somebody writes it, somebody else directs, somebody else produces, somebody else does this that and the other and the need to compromise tends to mean you end up with something that works, but doesn't please everybody.Tooted as a sequel to Sharkboy, it has about as much connection to Sharkboy as I have to quantum physics. There is little here that you haven't seen before considering the target audience, but I would say if you liked Rodriguez's other child-friendly films like Spy Kids and so on, you'll probably like this.",We Can Be Heroes

43,KissMyAss31193,Kids will love it,7,24 July 2021,"It's cheesy as hell and that's probably why I kinda love it as well. I guess I'll never truly understand how a director can make a gritty and gory comic book-movie like Sin City and then something as weird and wholesome s Spykids or in fact.. this.That's some flexibility right there.I actually thought about this quite a bit. A perfect kids B-movie like this has all the wholesome elements that make it family friendly, while having just enough creative elements within a simplistic package, so that kids will never be confused by what's happening, or what's at stake.This is certainly not a movie for adults, but the adult who made it is very experienced with adult entertainment in the cinematic sense. Don't get me wrong, this is all clean, but there is a little bit of stylistic bleed-over noticeable, for anyone paying attention.Overall I'd say this movie is fine.

And I was very disappointed with how everything went down!!! First off, and this one is my main complaint. Why the heck did the writers make it seem like SharkBoy just never said a word?! Now I fully understand why Taylor Launter said no in reprising his role! This version of SharkBoy literally said nothing! Nothing! Throughout the entire movie! And who are we kidding with the suit he had on?!? Are they serious! The only one with a decent costume was Lavagirl! And that's because her outfit was from the original film! I mean come on!!! If they wanted to make a sequel from SharkBoy and Lavagirl then they should have said so!! Just like they called Taylor Dooley to reprise her role, I'm sure it wouldn't have been that hard to get in touch with Taylor launter and say ""Hey we're launching a remake project on SharkBoy and Lavagirl, are you interested?"". I mean seriously! Not take it for a test run in this nonsense they call a movie! As for their kid, I won't say too much because Guppy is just as adorable as she wants to be and kids don't deserve to be bashed for doing their job as an upcoming kid actor or actress. But I'm most definitely coming for the adults! Mainly the writer's! This movie literally looks like no time or effort was put into it, some of the actors weren't even funny ( aka news anchor lady and man ) most scenes with the kids aren't well enthusiastic enough. It's just a whole mess! Bottom line of you have a five or four year old then by all means let them watch it.

66,nickijjohnson-16955,Should've been Sharkboy and LavaGirl movie,3,1 January 2021,"First off yes it is entertaining for kids but disappointing for older kids who were fans of Sharkboy and Lavagirl. The main girl in the movie should have been their daughter. We know who Sharkboy and Lavagirl are yet they're in the background of all these new characters. Why? Just because Taylor Lautner didnt come back for the role did not mean they had to A. cover his face and B. not give him one single line. Anyone who knows the character Sharkboy knows that being quiet is not his strong suit. They completely changed his character taking away his attitude and his one-liners (I.E ""Hungry? How bout a knuckle sandwich?"") I don't understand making this powerless child the main character. Not to mention the girl they cast to play Sharkboy and Lava Girls daughter was too young for the part and still talked like a toddler. You didn't even know who some of their parents were until the very end. They never show Christian Slater use his powers so how are you supposed to know that the kid who teleports was his son? And Noodle's mom wasn't stretchy so I guess we were supposed to know she was his mother because they have the same hair? And Wheels' father is a dumbass yet he's a genius. Although he's such a genius he didn't know that the girl who drew pictures was drawing pictures of the future? And the slow mo kid is so fast he's slow? Makes no sense. Sloppy writing all around but it's an R.R movie so of course it looks good. Just disappointing especially for Sharkboy and LavaGirl fans.",We Can Be Heroes

I also kept in mind this is for kids. It'd be odd being so critical with a film in terms of the audience. In this case, kids! So, things I liked about the film. It looks cleaner than any of the director's previous work. At least it looked better, not saying it's perfect but I did find sequences watchable and entertaining. I thought the cast was pretty good, they are children yeah, but to be honest it gave a lot of them opportunities to be involved in the film. Not everyone was sidelined to the point they were forgettable. Although I do have issues with this film, I mean, I didn't feel much from the adult cast, not to mention they aren't new faces, though the script and choices were probably not theirs to make, they definitely felt extra int he film, yet I kept in mind the focus were the kids but would've been nice using the older cast. Even a little more. I do see this movie impacting kids and teaching them to be strong so besides my complaints with it, I do see the good in this. Not the worst I've seen this year but definitely not the best film for children either. Watchable and entertaining. Not as bad and harsh as some people call it out to be.",We Can Be Heroes

71,CouchReview,We can be Heroes(2020)- Review,4,9 January 2021,"We can be Heroes is a superhero film, a standalone sequel to The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl (2005). In a world that is protected by superheroes 'Heroics Program', Missy Moreno (YaYa Gosselin) is a quiet & introvert girl who likes to be in the shadows, her father Marcus Moreno (Pedro Pascal) once the leader of all the heroes, now stays low and away from being a hero as he has promised to Missy to do so. On a dreary morning earth is attacked by aliens much powerful than all the heroes combined. To fight them Marcus has to break his promise and pick up his sword once again. But to no avail he along with all the heroes are captured by the aliens. Meanwhile before Marcus goes to the battleground Missy is transported to the Heroics Headquarters where she is kept with children of other heroes, they are children but all with their own set of superpowers, unlike Missy who doesn't have any. The Heroics program is headed by Ms. Granada (Priyanka Chopra Jonas) who orders the 'super kids' to stay put in the headquarters as their parents have been captured. With the defenders of earth now fallen it is up to their kids to save their world from an alien takeover.
The movie even with its rudimentary plot is still able to throw a few surprises no viewer would be expecting. The post-production work is not great but at a satisfactory level one would expect from a movie where people fly. As far as positives go that's about it.
Priyanka Chopra Jones starts off bad and gets even worse as the film continues. It is unclear what the target audience of the movie is with it trying to emulate a few aspects of the MCU and at the same time displaying a juvenile storyline with even more childish scenes. Robert Rodriguez doesn't do anything worthy of mentioning. The story reminds the viewer of Sky High (2005) with a couple of its sub-plots. The background score too was abysmal & unnecessary. With great performances in the recent past, even Pedro Pascal can't make the movie remotely worthwhile to watching.
Netflix most certainly would have better projects to put its resources into but it is still went on to make this, who know why. We can be Heroes is one of the worst way to spend your well-awaited evening of enjoyment. No one should waste their time watching this awful production. If you stare at the wall for two hours it will still be better use of time than watching this movie.

The dialogue and attempted comedy in this movie is so cringe-inducing that it makes Disney's Descendants look like Citizen Kane by comparison, and I hate to slam child actors but most of the ones cast in this movie are really really bad. The only positive thing I can say about this film is that now there is a worse superhero movie starring Pedro Pascal than Wonder Woman 1984.I'm sure a lot of people will defend this atrocity with the standard ""It's a kids movie? but that's no excuse for lazy writing and poor character development, actually, this film had no character development and the script felt as if it was written by kids.

I watched Spy Kids- the first one is an okay, second one not watched, third one was a below average and I hated the fourth one. Robert Rodriguez's kids films are not that appreciated but according to me this film is good not great. The acting is good such as the kids and YaYa Gosselin did an amazing job as playing the character of Missy Moreno and I also appreciate the other kid actor's acting especially the kid actor for Guppy who has cool powers and also the daughter of Sharkboy and Lavagirl. Rewind and Fast Forward build up their relationship throughout the movie which I really appreciate. Wild Card also gets a lesson from Missy which quite impressive for a character buildup. Others were also great. Coming to the adult Heroics. Starting with the leader, Pedro Pascal as Marcus Moreno who always is an excellent actor and his acting was also great in this film. Pedro Pascal and YaYa Gosselin have a great chemistry in this film and also the others. The other adult Heroics have a great relationship in the film. Coming to the end, there are two twists. The first one was a surprise which was hinted in other scenes but not noticeable. Second one kind of gives this movie issues. First it just ruins the evil plans in this film and second it makes this film kind of just a setup for a franchise.Overall, this movie has a little bad CGI but it entertains.

I didn't want to hear about it. The only reason I watched this movie was for dear Pedro Pascal (even he couldn't make it enjoyable).Yes lots of children movies are cheesy, but most were enjoyable for the rest of the family to watch. As a retired child myself, I remembered liking content that was made for a general audience, because although kids are well... kids, they like watching more mature types of things because they want to act more mature (although they wouldn't get some jokes until years after.) That's why every child now turned teen, or teen now turned adult likes watching like Shrek all the time or something.This movie was horrific, especially since it was supposed to be related to SBaLG but they didn't even get 5 minutes of screen time?! Plus the writers messed up the whole story of ""They are supposed to be dreams conjured by a child"" and skipped straight to, ""They're popular superheroes on a team in the real world!!"" They sure did drop that bomb on my childhood.Moral of this is, I'm not a professional child anymore, but I know children's movies, and I know what children like. This won't be a memorable movie, it won't even be a fever dream to my younger siblings who've watched this; it's just a trip down cheap street to generate another let down for a boost of cash.

181,tehyaeddy-96667,A nostalgic fever dream,3,5 January 2021,"This is...bad, to put it lightly. It's a bad movie, and I know how hated this word can be, but it is indeed very, very cringe. You can see the inspiration from spy kids, and evidently shark boy & lava girl (seeing as the characters feature in the film, almost like a bizarre parody of themselves.) Almost impressively, the cgi hasn't improved, even though it is now 2020. The costume design is also just as terrible. Not even when it comes to just the superhero outfits, even the kids' clothes look...bad.The main cast are all children, which presents the usual issues when it comes to acting, though it was bearable in comparison to some child-acted roles.The characters were lacklustre and cliche, as were the plot beats, with each reveal fairly easy to predict. There were a few laughs on my end, though they were aimed at the film, not with.Some cute moments, but mostly this film was a terribly acted knock-off. I suppose it would be fine for young children, as a distraction or background noise, though there is nothing particularly informative, with no real strong moral message (other than ""teamwork good""), and I can't imagine any conscious adult enjoying sitting through this steaming trash.Maybe give it a watch, if you want to be reminded of spy kids or shark boy & lava girl, or hell, even sky high (which this was vaguely reminiscent of.)I will always personally prefer Sb & Lg though, and would recommend showing your kids the classics instead of this poor attempt at recreating them.",We Can Be Heroes

184,uptowner-42193,Laughably forgettable,2,31 May 2021,"If you are like me, and have seen other movies by Robert Rodriguez, then you know that his movies are either hit or miss. With his Spy Kids films, they were mostly passable, save for the soft reboot that was the fourth one. However, one of his more atrocious movies was Sharkboy and Lavagirl. If you saw this movie, you either forgot it instantly or still have sleep paralysis. Naturally, Rodriguez decided to make a sequel, and this nightmare fueled insanity that is somehow a movie is that sequel.The acting is laughably bland, and the plot is beyond forgettable. Not only that, but the climax of the film, which is the most important piece of the film, ends up being nothing. It is pointless and dumb. And so is the entire movie. There are so many plot holes that I won't mention, but here are a few of the big ones; Why don't the alien people just release the adult super people if they end up being good guys? Why don't the other super kids know that the iPad girl isn't actually a super kid? Why do the alien people attack the kids if they are ""helping"" them? The entire movie is just so dumb and pointless. The only reason that it has a two out of ten instead of a one out of ten is because it serves as a somewhat passable kids' film if your kid's brain is a scrambled egg.Overall, I hated this movie, and I will never see it again.",We Can Be Heroes
185,FinnRiffs,"A poorly-established, low-budget film with a decent, but poorly-executed message.",3,15 June 2021,"Before we begin, I just have to say that I genuinely respect Robert Rodriguez. He is a man who shows that you can make a good film with a low budget, as seen with his movies like Sin City, From Dusk Till Dawn, and The Faculty.Not every good filmmaker is without a bad movie, or in Robert's case, several (Spy Kids 4, anyone?). It's been a rough couple of years, movie-wise, for Rodriguez; he was a producer and writer on the critical and box-office failure Uglydolls, he directed/written/produced Alita: Battle Angel, which had lukewarm (but mostly positive) reviews, and he directed/written/produced Red 11, which gained negative reviews. He also directed an episode of The Mandalorian, the episode was well-received from what I heard.As I said before, Robert Rodriguez CAN make a good movie, but those are his movies for adults/or teenagers. When he makes movies for children, like The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl, and pretty much every Spy Kids sequel, he really fumbles the ball.For example, his children's films usually have some issues: Bad special effects that make you realize the low budget, lackluster writing, and less-than-stellar performances from both the child actors (which I can excuse, due to them having not a lot of experience) and the the adult actors.His latest venture into children's filmmaking, the Netflix original ""We Can Be Heroes"", is no exception.My first complaint is about the message of the movie, and by that, I mean how the message is delivered. The message is your standard ""the children are our future"" pap, but it's done in such a bland, half-hearted way, it reminds me of that scene in School Of Rock when Jack Black's character (who pretends to be his roommate to get a job as a substitute teacher at a prestigious prep school) quotes the first two lines of Whitney Houston's 'Greatest Love of All' (""I believe the children are our future, teach them well and lead the way."") upon being asked on his opinion on the students that he's teaching, as a way to seem like he's genuine, but not really. What I'm saying is that the way the message is delivered feels fake, and cheap.The script of the movie is VERY poorly-made, at some points it feels like a first draft. The movie's main story concerns a superhero team called The Heroics. Early on in the story, the Heroics get kidnapped by aliens and its up to their kids to save them. When they get kidnapped, we get a sad sequence of the kid's watching in horror as their parents get kidnapped, and the movie tries to make us feel bad too. Here's where the movie fails at that, we barely get to know seven out of the eleven Heroics, the other four member's names are mentioned in the credits. We only get to see the parent-child relationships for fifteen seconds per parent/kid scene at the end. The reason why people feel sad when they see Simba's dad die in The Lion King, is that we get to know Simba's dad Mufasa, and the type of relationship they have until Scar kills Mufasa! The movie doesn't show the type of relationship each member of The Heroics have with their kid, we only get a of insight with the main character Missy Moreno and her Dad, Marcus Moreno (Played by Pedro Pascal) who is the leader of the Heroics.Now, there's a plot twist involving an alien takeover that raises more questions than answers: The twist is that the evil aliens that kidnapped the kid's parents and tried to take over the world were good all along, and it was all a training exercise for the kids. But, here's the real kicker, the president of America (who is supposed to be a parody of Donald Trump, because he fumbles his words up) is secretly an alien, and Priyanka Chopra's character, who is supposed to be the mean, child-hating human adversary, and a kid character who was on the kid hero team named Ojo are also aliens who were in on the test. They openly admit to infiltrating the government and the Heroics, but they don't get ANY punishment for their heinous crimes. Like, the announcement of the takeover and the adult superheroes getting kidnapped got coverage on national TV in the film, so I bet the people wouldn't be happy with finding out that the government AND the Heroics are being ran by aliens, so it means that the alien takeover ALREADY HAPPENED.If you're a little kid, you'll like it, but if you're an adult, the plot holes will be a little too much.",We Can Be Heroes

199,SSFilms269,"Its a kids movie, please stop taking it seriously",7,31 December 2020,"The bad kids movies are the ones that make kids bored. Which is the opposite of what parents buy them for, this movie however, does the opposite of that. While it may not be a theatrical masterpiece or an SFX work of art, the movie provides entertainment for not only the kids watching but the adults. The callback to Sharkboy And Lavagirl make this film appealing to audiences such as myself (16) and my parents who showed me the film, and have familiar memories of it. The 'cheesy' acting can sometimes get annoying but can be overlooked as, again, this is a kids film. Some of the comedy throughout this film was effective, such as the windows firewall icon that disables the shield to the pyramid rocket that is meant to take over earth, strange plot huh? Which brings me on to my next point, the film features a-lot of exposition, which makes the plot more predictable, such as the alien spy story line, however being a kids movie, this is needed as the plot has quite a developed plot. Ive mentioned quite a-lot how this film is a kids film (which a-lot of the media-critics need to remember) but this film features many parts that adults will find entertaining. Such as the previously mentioned Sb+Lg throwback, the windows reference, but also subtle details such as the warning signs back at Heroics HQ, with warnings such as 'no freeze rays' and the obvious 'no powers' which wildcard procedes to break each of later in the film. We can only believe that these were put up to prevent what happened in the control bay. The film finishes with your classic children's message, this one being that 'we're all heroes' and of course 'children are better than adults', which being a 16 year old myself, i can only agree with.",We Can Be Heroes

The plot is predictable, cheesy, cliche, shall I go on? The CGI is subpar to trash. The usage of green screen is done horribly, and set look so fake, that it's hard for me to take it seriously.

NO POWER, seriously? leadership cant save your parents, idk why they let her be leader in the first place. also, with that leadership, the rest of the characters were terrible at first and a little bit of encouragement helps them work together in like 8 minutes. also, why do the other main characters act like fillers the whole time. aside from ojo, they barely talk at all, so whats the point of them being the main characters? theres a lot more i would talk about, but my disappointment cant express itself into words.some people might say that its a kids/family movie and that we would have different opinions on it...but if your child has seen the originals they would be disappointed too. netflix really wasted some money on this film, and personally i don't think you should watch this mess.",We Can Be Heroes

Loved Pedro Pascal in ""The Mandalorian"". He had nothing much to offer. Priyanka Jonas is probably the biggest negative in this film.. Her lack luster performance made things much worse. Regina King or Tiffany Haddish would be a much better replacement. Making this movie itself is a waste, why are they making a sequel? There are better movies on Netflix.",We Can Be Heroes

There has been many kids movies that were hands down amazing or at least good. It just seemed like spy kids had a better plot than this movie. I have never been so disappointed in a movie like this in a long time, so much to the point that I have to make a review. And on top of the that, this movie had the audacity to be an hour and 40 minutes long. There were characters in this movie who could've ended fights with ease instantly and yet they do absolutely nothing at all. They could have even made up for it with their acting but that was even worse. The dialogue, CGI, acting, plot is just wow. I mean this could've been so much better.",We Can Be Heroes

I thought that it was a good movie.I'm glad that they had a diverse group of kids with many different creative powers. I thought the girl is so high pitch was a good creative power. Another one fast forward and rewind powers, And the slow motion power which I still don't get it it was pretty funny honestly I was laughing at has powers the whole time. The only thing I don't like is how the leader didn't have power but she was telling all the kids want to do. I don't think that would fly with kids today in the real world having one person telling somebody what to do. She was like do this do that.People they're on their writing negative reviews and they must not spend time with her kids. I understand it's about the kids and no matter what they want to watch, do, or play, spending quality time with them means a lot to them.

I can't believe Padró Pascal did this hahaha.... my daughter really enjoyed it and she's gonna be 8 in two months so there's your target audience and it should be.

I actually got a headache from it. There were a lot of really cheesy parts but hey... kids movie, right? The little girl that plays Shark Boy & Lava Girls daughter ""Guppy"" was really cute though.

we got a dark emo boy that miraculously becomes a kind kid and all the other kids were treated as filler, I would have loved if we got the spagetti curtly haired boy as a protagonist.
Should have made the girl Max's daughter with ice powers or something. The fight scenes were horrible, the equivalent of the fight of Sakura Haruno and Ino Yamanaka in the chunin exams.
Terrible, sharkboy didn't even talk.
There was no sense of urgency and all of the movie was terrible. I just lost nearly two hours of my life I would never get back.",We Can Be Heroes

The acting was bad, yes, but how often is it the child Actors in their breakout movie are good? That's not my problem with this movie. My problem is that I have spent longer being mad at this movie than the time it took to actually watch.
The plot was made up as they went along. That is the only explanation I can find for why things were so incoherent. What should have been major plot points, came out to just be major plot holes. The power system does not make sense. The villains didnt make sense at the start, and especially do not make sense at the end. The twists cant even be considered twists, because they either are too obvious to be twists, or have absolutely no warning and function as a ""Gotcha"". There are scenes that are completely invalidated by earlier scenes. I watched this movie with a child, and they asked ""but why are they..."" at various points in the movie. If a child thinks your movie for children doesnt make sense, then your movie for children does not make sense and should not be made.

If the kiddos wouldve had a better plot and a better antagonist it would've been better IMO.BUT we didnt even watch for the first time until Mid January bc I forgot about the release of it- in the 3 weeks since my son has watched it, he has watched ti MINIMUM 5 times since then, it 100% works for it's target audience and full deserves the 9 stars, just bc I hate it. Doesn't mean it dropped the ball on what it was made for. I hope they make another, bc seeing my 6 year old love sequels to things i watched as a child makes my heart happy",We Can Be Heroes
307,SkylerMaeRoberts,Loved It!!,10,12 February 2021,"Since this is basically a spinoff of The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl and were the second main Heroics...
ONLY thing they should have made more sense would be to make Techno (Wildcard's) father, Dreamboy:(Main Character in The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl)....
Wildcard was the temporary leader of the heroics children with ALL abilities of Dream Boy... so why not just make Techo Dream boy amd Wildcard his son instead of creating an entire different character when his kid has all the original abilities of the (Dreamboy) main character in The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl

310,tashaasparks,"It's for KIDS, people. Get a grip.",8,23 February 2021,"As a movie buff and an ADULT I didn't find it to be a great movie but kids are visual. They like the colors and exaggerated emotions and spontaneous fun. They couldn't care less how ""original the plot is"". Good grief. Some of yall need to stay off the internet. My 5 year old really likes this movie and I will continue to watch it with her as many times as she wants because it's a special movie about the parent-child bond. Thank you Robert Rodriguez and all the actors and crew for bringing us family friendly entertainment that has nearly vanished in modern times for some reason.",We Can Be Heroes
311,gabrylmcalester,Super Cute Family Movie,10,8 March 2021,"I loved it, it was super cute cheesy family fun.
I don't understand the low rating, but I thought this was really kid friendly and had a nice message at the end .",We Can Be Heroes
312,chacharealsmoothdab,"Bad, not good 🙄",2,20 March 2021,"I know it's a kids movie but this is just an abomination! The writing is awful and the characters are annoying. They hinged off the fact Sharkboy and lava girl's child was in it yet they were barely mentioned. The main character was useless and stupid. I get that for kids it was probably great, but seriously? The CGI was awful. Just because it's good for goods doesn't mean it needs to be cheap and colorful. I'd give it a headache/10",We Can Be Heroes
313,bastidehitta,AMAZING MOVIE! THE KIDS LOVED IT AND SO DID I,10,2 April 2021,"Amazing acting, the plot was absolutely phenomenal! It was intricately placed with surprisingly detailed and knowledgeable background information on all of the characters, and an enjoyable amount of foreshadowing. To the untrained eye, the movie seems like it's full of plot holes and cheesy twists, but to an absolute professional, the plot is majestically placed with the heroes all intertwining with their cooperative skills and teamwork to defeat the, 'villain.' To be honest, we all thought it was going to be a cheesy, 'the good guy turns into the villain' type plot but we were all swayed and taken aback when the entire movie turned out to be a big training camp. Overall, the movie was a crowd-pleasing, science-fiction work of art that people all ages alike can come to enjoy.",We Can Be Heroes
314,e-29014,Review,1,24 May 2021,While yes it was cheesy it was made for kids. That isn't my problem with it. My problem with the movie is how they advertised it to be a sequel to Shark Boy and Lava Girl but barely show them. They also break the rules that were created in the first movie (they were a dream) and never showed Max in the second movie. They randomly add superheros to the world even though they weren't present at all before. If there were some sort of explanation for why superheros existed and why Max didn't matter for Shark Boy and Lava Girl any more it would be a little better. My last complaint that isn't really related to the other is how they had a non verbal character for most of the movie before taking that away from her. There was no reason for her to be nonverbal if it was going to be taken away at the end. She still could've done foreshadowing and be quite but making her nonverbal just to be verbal at the end seems wrong to me and really upset me personally.,We Can Be Heroes
315,pmnjwyk,negative reviews,9,1 August 2021,"Why so many negative reviews? I understand that this isn't the best movie and yes some scenes are cringe and some are cheesy and predictable but you need to understand that it's a family film. The cgi isn't the best i can admit but like do you expect the cgi to be like the cgi in stranger things? It's literally a movie directed towards kids. Overall i think the movie is good, it's one of my favourites but as i said i do admit some of the scenes were pretty cringe.",We Can Be Heroes
316,angelinacatino,"NOT A MOVIE FOR ADULTS, GET OVER IT",9,1 August 2021,"Specifically created an account to let people know that yes, this movie is pure cringe! But guess what?!?!?! ITS A KIDS MOVIE!!!! Does not deserve the hate it's getting, as the TARGET AUDIENCE (ie my 6 & 10 yr olds) loved it!! Action packed and motivating! Some pretty fun famous actors make an appearance as well.",We Can Be Heroes
317,gameknight-03419,I liked it,8,28 August 2021,"I don't think that the movie should get a much flak as it does, but there are some valid criticisms. I agree a kids movie shouldn't have the same standards of quality as a movie for adults, but I agree with the saying,' A kids movie that adults can't enjoy is a bad kids movie'. A criticism I see a lot is that the movie make cringey jokes, and they do a lot, but any jokes that references a semi-related movie I found incredibly enjoyable, and shows that the writers had at least a semblance of respect for the original works. Another one that I saw was that the music sucked, but that's something that I never saw. In the introduction scene for the Supers' kids , when they introduced Guppy I knew who her parents were just by the light motif that they played. Overall, it's a pretty good movie. Plus, it was made by the same director and studio that made the entire spy-kids series as well as Sharkboy and Lavagirl. I enjoyed it, as well as the rest of my family.",We Can Be Heroes
318,ccastellanos-26242,Fun for the kiddos,7,5 September 2021,My children liked the movie very much and that's all it matters. Everyone with a bad review needs to relax and let kids enjoy a feel-good movie catered for them.,We Can Be Heroes
319,haileymoua,Just terrible,1,22 October 2021,"I watched this with my family today and we couldn't stop making fun of it. This is literally the cheap version of ""Sky High"" but the mc doesn't even get powers. The names and powers are so bad it's funny, I get its a kids movie but you could really do better if you put in time and effort.",We Can Be Heroes

321,klabrum,Even kids' movies can be clever,5,30 December 2020,"I didn't realize this was the sequel to SharkBoy and LavaGirl, which I haven't seen. I thought the storyline was interesting and engaging. The theme was heavy handed and clumsy but I can see younger children enjoying it.The diversity of the cast was refreshing and I'm thrilled to see this happening.However the acting was just abysmal. Overacting doesn't even start to describe. It felt like an older silent movie where you had to emote big to communicate but sadly, there were also voices involved. There's a fine line between cheese and camp and sadly this blundered through the camp and settled firmly on cheese.",We Can Be Heroes
322,unclerussg,Watch Paint dry .. you'd have more fun,1,3 October 2021,"This movie ... oh my gosh, painful to watch. The whole thing comes off dull, slow boring, don't care about anyting going on... it made me wish aliens really were coming to earth to kill us all ... but . Oh shocking .... the whole thing was a ""lesson"" or whatever ... just do yourself a favor and pick the next movie you see on the list ... scroll past this one.",We Can Be Heroes
323,hrmatsui,Not worth it,3,1 January 2021,"This movie was supposed to be the continuation of Shark Boy and Lava Girl, but it barely compares to the original one. First of all, Lava Girl has only a few lines and Shark Boy, well, it is not even the same actor. The script is awful, they underestimate the intelligence of today's children. Jokes are so unfunny it is embarrassing, even for the little ones. The superpowers kids in this movie have don't actually make sense, specially during the third act (not getting into any spoilers here). CGI is terrible, not much to say about it. In summary, there are many other better movies than this on Netflix.",We Can Be Heroes
324,Konstantinos-metaxas,Not for adults,3,30 December 2020,"For 5 years old it's ok. Not for adults. Some funny moments, and a collection from various action heroes movies. Nothing special, some special.effects. Children actors are ok",We Can Be Heroes
325,richardhudginsphotograph,My 5 year old daughter LOVED it.,8,28 December 2020,And that's exactly who it was made for. Everything doesn't have to be complex and cater to adults. She loved Sharkboy and Lava girl and this was much much better.,We Can Be Heroes
326,ttdavis18,Think about what you want your kids to be watching. I love this movie because...,10,29 December 2020,"1. My 8 year old loves it. Watched it three times in a row.
2. No underlying sexual stuff.
3. No snarky language to pick up. I am so tired of my 8 year old talking to me like a 15 year old valley girl ( that is on me for letting her watch other garbage with higher ratings)
4. Lots of positive messages.
5. Teamwork and self improvement over gender bashing
6. Some really clever writing. It is hard to add clever writing into kids movies. The plot must be simple. It is for kids. (eg. single file)
7. Great sets and graphics. Bright colors, makes me happy.
8. Leading by example taught better than I have been able to teach.
9. All awesome kid actors
10. So much heart. My favorite one of the franchise! I hope there is a sequel. ( To be fair, I don't think I have seen all of them, but parts of most)Okay, I am 50 so I will also watch anything with even a few minutes of Christian Slater.",We Can Be Heroes

328,mj-lorenzana1,WTH did I just watch. Enjoyed it though. 1/10 Movie 10/10 Time,5,30 December 2020,"So, this is my first ever review, even though I have been using IMDb for years, but I just had to for this movie.Now to the point. This movie is truly terrible. Everything about it is terrible; the acting, the plot, the story, the music, the cinematic, etc. ,,It's supposed to be for kids"", personally, doesn't excuse to make such a garbage movie. BUT, and here it comes. I did enjoy the movie, because I watched it with friends. We couldn't stop but laughing about all the bad things this movie had. We enjoyed ourselves WAY more than we should have, but we did.So, I don't recommend you to watch this movie alone or if you are expecting a masterpiece. Cause it is truly garbage. But if you watch this with some good friends, who normally also appreciate good movies, you will have a blast of a time. That is why I gave it a 5 star rating, even tough it is a 1 Star movie. But it is so bad it's good",We Can Be Heroes
329,pabloemontes-357-527685,Really fun!,8,27 December 2020,"Robert Rodriguez is back at it again!. If you ever found joy in the spy kids franchise, you'll find it again here. This movie is just fun and lighthearted, the acting and efects are good, and it's clearly made with a lot of love and heart. It is ultimately a movie made for children that adults can still sit back and just enjoy. Being mad at this movie for the plot is like being angry at green eggs and ham.",We Can Be Heroes
330,benpsutcliffe,Guff,2,31 December 2020,"Based off the trailer I felt it could have been something I would happily watch along with my 6 and 9 year old boys.
Instead, it was the movie watching equivalent of having the webs between my toes sliced with a thousand paper cuts.
The acting is mostly horrendous, the plot and story telling was painfully shallow although its propped up a little by some relatively decent special effects and production.
I've seen worse (Going Overboard with Adam Sandler) but not much.
Pedro Pascal is one of my favourite actors around at the moment and he shall be forgiven for this but I plead with him and his agent to never consider a sequel to anything that includes the characters Sharkboy or Lavagirl",We Can Be Heroes
331,joeshachaf,"Nice, naive movie for the little ones",9,31 January 2021,"This is a very nice and naive movie for the little ones. I doubt adults will enjoy it, but then again, I don't think it is aimed at that age range.
The plot is simple and easy to follow, most kids will find at least one character to relate to, the happy ending makes sure there are no ""winners"" or ""losers"", so if you relate to one of the alien characters, they still end up being ""good guys"".
The plot enforce many values, like accepting the different, lead by example, and many others.
Bottom line, it is a great time passer for young children.",We Can Be Heroes

While I enjoyed the connection to their other favorite Sharkboy & Lavagirl this one highlights the importance of working with others and everyone has their own talents. What made me write this review was my 3 year old just told me he wants to be wheels when he grows up. I gave him a high five and said that's awesome. I love that the movie chose to have one of their superheroes in a wheel chair and that my kid looks up to him.
