0,MartinHafer,"About midway through, it starts to become really, really stupid...and then it only gets worse.",3,2 November 2011,"During the first portion of this film, I was confused. After all, I remembered when the film debuted and just how scathing the reviews were--yet it didn't seem that bad. Aside from revealing secrets way too quickly and not exactly being original, it was a pretty decent film. But then, to quote Marlon Brando, ""...the horror"". What went wrong? I have no idea. All I know is that it looked as if the famed director, John Frankenheimer, must have given up and let his cat direct the film. And, as for the writing, it must have been left up to his dog...because this film truly is a dog! What surprised me is that although his appearance was weird and ghastly, Marlon Brando wasn't bad. Later in life, he seemed to often 'phone in' his performances--and he strayed very, very far from the scripts (which he was famous for not learning or memorizing). Here he might have done the same, but it worked. Val Kilmer, on the other hand, made absolutely no sense and looked as if he was on acid for most of the latter portion of the film. He must have felt pretty embarrassed by all this...or just didn't care (which it really appears to be). I could say more, but Mr. Kilmer is still alive and I'd hate to make him cry. But the biggest surprise I talked about above--Frankenheimer. How could the genius who directed classics like ""Day of the Jackel"" and ""Seconds"" make this mess?! Too often instead of brilliance, he gave us explosions, gun fights and bloody guts. What happened?! Why the appeal to stupid people and the sense of nihilism?!By the way, what did I think was the best moment in the film? Well, actually, there were two. First, when Kilmer's character was killed. Second, when the closing credits began to roll. Yes, the final half of the film is THAT bad! It's especially bad because it took a heck of a lot of money and the film STILL turned out this awful.",The Island of Dr. Moreau
1,bkoganbing,Marlon's Freak Show,3,21 September 2008,"This expensive remake of the Paramount classic, The Island of Doctor Moreau fell on all fours in the telling. It looks like the inspiration wasn't Moreau, but rather Tod Browning's classic Freaks.The film was not done on the cheap either either, shot in gorgeous technicolor in a tropical location in Queensland in Australia, replacement director John Frankenheimer did the best he could, but he had a couple of runaway actors in Marlon Brando and Val Kilmer who just went completely over the top. And the computer graphic creations made me think that Narnia had gone over to the dark side.This was once again one of Marlon Brando's Christian Defense Fund films made to pay the lawyer's for his son's murder trial. It was during the filming of The Island of Dr. Moreau that daughter Cheyenne Brando committed suicide. I'm not sure what anyone could have done with Brando at that point.Of course I'm not sure what Val Kilmer's excuse, was except that he might have seen this was going to be an expensive turkey and he might as well cut himself a slice or two of ham. Brando's three hundred pound albino Moreau reminded me of Dale the Whale from the Monk series and he seemed to recycle bits of Colonel Kurtz from Apocalypse Now into his performance. Then Kilmer decides to do an imitation of him.When we first meet Brando he's being carried through the jungle on what looks like the Popemobile and dressed all in white and giving waves and benedictions to the crowd of his creations looked for all the world like the Pope going through St. Peter's. If this was to inspire awe, it missed the mark, I laughed myself silly. This version of The Island Of Dr. Moreau had to bow to advances in medical science since Charles Laughton and Arthur Hohl were operating in the House of Pain. What Brando is doing is injecting human DNA in various amounts in different creatures, creating his freak show. Still Laughton's sadistic experiments gave us more genuine terror than what Brando was doing.This one will make you nostalgic for the old House of Pain.",The Island of Dr. Moreau
2,Leofwine_draca,How not to make a movie,4,6 August 2016,"An unnecessary second remake (following the oft-forgotten '77 version with Michael York) of 1932's THE ISLAND OF LOST SOULS, based of course on the classic short story by H.G. Wells. A huge flop on release, this movie starts off pretty well and looks extremely promising with the crisp, highly colourful photography and interesting locations (Queensland actually). Sadly it deteriorates constantly as it goes on, until it becomes an almost parody of itself at the end, and is completely impossible to take seriously!Directorial disputes resulted in original director Richard Stanley being fired in place of the more mainstream John Frankenheimer, although even his veteran presence can't hide the dodgy editing and episodic nature of the narrative. The movie opens very promisingly with an well-choreographed fight aboard a rubber dinghy (trust me, it is very impressive) but that about as exciting as it gets. British star David Thewlis (not a bad actor, but his character is far too whiny to be likable) meets up with the ever-grouchy Val Kilmer, who takes him a remote island where they meet the incredible Marlon Brando. Brando overacts as never before in this movie, dressed in a white sheet and white face-paint, and his hamminess knows no bounds; his performance is so terribly and completely off beat that it serves as one of the movie's highlights.Soon afterwards, a hyena man discovers the implant which Moreau uses to control him through painful shocks, and tears it out, thus inciting a riot amongst the beast men, who eventually storm the island and learn how to use guns. The action-packed finale is absolutely terrible and laughable, with the beast men having far too much screen time (forget the eerie glimpses in the original - here they're on screen for ages which totally ruins their impact) and running and jumping about all over the place before they all kill each other.Aside from the miscast Thewlis, the wooden Kilmer and the laughable Brando, there is one other main character - Fairuza Balk (THE CRAFT), who plays a panther woman. Balk is far more attractive here than she was as the teenage witch in that other '96 horror movie, and indeed her feral beauty does most of the acting for her. Hidden inside costumes and make-up are a number of noted actors like Ron Perlman, Mark Dacascos, and Verne Troyer, but you'd never recognise them. The special effects are by Stan Winston, and the beast men are initially very impressive, with CGI being interspersed flawlessly with live-action footage. Sadly their overexposure soon shows and, as you see more and more of them, the less impressive they become until the laughing stocks of the finale.The morals are muddled and the film ends in an inconclusive fashion with most of the cast dead and the rest carrying on with their lives. A tragedy it is not as most of the dead characters are selfish and unlikeable or just plain odd. In the other versions, Moreau was attacked and killed at the end of the film, but that happens halfway through here, leaving the movie floundering with nowhere to really go afterwards. Kilmer ends up going mad too and dressing as Brando, but the irritatingly non-conclusive script means that you never figure out why.With an above average cast wasted along with a substantial budget, hopefully the poor reception of this movie at the box office has put off any other chancers with an idea of making a buck from a remake of a classic horror film. In an ideal world it certainly would, but I'm not so sure. THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU is worth a look as a curiosity piece for sure, but it feels all the more frustrating as you get the impression that a good idea is in here somewhere, waiting to get out.",The Island of Dr. Moreau
3,SnoopyStyle,interesting turns ridiculous,2,3 December 2014,UN peace negotiator Edward Douglas (David Thewlis) survives a plane crash and other survivors in the Java Sea. He is rescued by Montgomery (Val Kilmer)'s ship. Edward is dropped off with Montgomery on a mysterious island. He meets Aissa (Fairuza Balk) and then Dr. Moreau (Marlon Brando). Moreau has been on the island for 17 years obsessed with animal research.There are some interesting makeup jobs. I think Thewlis is miscast for Douglas. He should be more of an innocent and maybe younger. The start is kind of interesting but then a white-out Marlon Barndo comes in with his Popemobile. It turns something interesting into something ridiculous. It's like Brando insists on being stupid looking. It just deteriorates from there on. The movie loses all tension as the plot meanders. Thewlis is such a cool customer that he can't project fear from the mounting danger. It's also not campy enough to be funny.,The Island of Dr. Moreau
4,lee_eisenberg,better than most people said,7,26 May 2006,"Maybe most critics panned ""The Island of Dr. Moreau"" because director John Frankenheimer has been known for the likes of ""The Manchurian Candidate"", so everyone expected more from him. The truth is, the movie isn't any kind of masterpiece, but not bad at all. Granted, some scenes do seem a little silly (and Marlon Brando looks weird wearing a muumuu), but the movie does take a scathing look at science. Maybe in later years we'll take a more serious look at the movie. Brando, Val Kilmer, David Thewlis, Fairuza Balk and Ron Perlman all do a pretty good job in their roles.So are YOU ready to try and turn animals into humans?",The Island of Dr. Moreau
5,ccthemovieman-1,Very Interesting Re-Make,8,11 October 2006,"This is a something different when it was released, yet not so in the film world as it was first made into a movie in the 1930s and was called ""Te Island Of Lost Souls."" This re-make produced some fascinating and gruesome human- monsters. You can thank Hollywood FX wizard Stan Winston for these creatures.Meanwhile, Marlon Brando and Val Kilmer ""play God"" attempting to create perfect human beings. What is created instead are ""people"" you almost don't want to look at. It took me two viewings to be okay with it. The first viewing left a bad taste in my mouth, but I gave it a second (and a third) look because the story is so different and intriguing. I liked Brando's dialog, too. His role, as ""Dr. Moreau,"" was easily the best in the film.What else is a bit unusual is that almost all the main characters in this are killed off by the end, some with sudden surprise.Back in the '90s, this was one of the best-looking DVDs I had seen up to that point.",The Island of Dr. Moreau
6,ma-cortes,Average adaptation based on H.G. Wells' novel realized by John Frankenheimer and with remarkable makeup by Stan Winston,5,31 March 2011,"It's an excitingly produced remake of ¨Island of the lost souls¨ with Marlon Brando heading a solid casting as a nutty doctor who develops a process of transforming animals into half-humans at an desolated tropical island . Through DNA experimentation Brando has upset the balance of nature. By turning animals into humans, he's turned heaven into hell . It starts when David Thewlis is rescued at sea by Val Kilmer and brought to a strange island where he's terrified to discover the terrible genetic experiments realized by Dr. Moreau , a former prize Nobel winner .Passable horror-fantasy chiller that is developed up and down with some lousy moments and in other side contains eerie and thrilling scenes. It results to be a strong rendition of H.G. Wells' novel about an isolated scientific who has spent several years creating half-animals turning beasts into half-human . Good secondary cast as Fauriza Balk , William Hootkins and Temuera Morrison . Ron Perlman's sturdy acting , displaying a magnificent portrayal of one of the beasts . Watchable by excellent makeup by the late Stan Winston . Colorful cinematography filmed in Queensland , Australia , by the classic cameraman William A. Fraker and atmospheric musical score by Gary Chang . The motion picture is middlingly directed by John Frankenheimer and the director's cut version runs several minutes more . The movie will appeal to Brando devotees and Val Kilmer fans who will want to check out their excessive performances . Other adaptation based on H.G. Wells' known novel are the following : The classic of 1933 titled ¨The island of lost souls¨ by Erle C. Kenton with Charles Laughton , Kathleen Burke , Bela Lugosi and Richard Arlen ; and 1977 retelling by Don Taylor with Burt Lancaster , Michael York , Barbara Carrera and Nigel Davenport .",The Island of Dr. Moreau
7,moonspinner55,Well-produced but out of control,4,15 April 2006,"David Thewlis is very good as air-crash survivor who is taken to mysterious island in the South Pacific where recluse Marlon Brando mutates various animals with human genes; Fairuza Balk is Brando's daughter, Val Kilmer (in arguably his weakest performance ever) plays Brando's assistant. Uncontrolled version of H.G. Wells' horror story is crippled by behind-the-scenes strife and ego clashes. It opens well, sustains itself for about forty-five minutes, but then goes completely to hell afterward. John Frankenheimer is credited with the scrappy direction, though he stepped in mid-production and finished the picture after Kilmer had the original director canned. Too bad, with more focus this could've been incredible. Story previously filmed in 1933 (as ""Island of Lost Souls"") and with Michael York and Burt Lancaster in 1977. ** from ****",The Island of Dr. Moreau
8,BandSAboutMovies,Ugh,2,3 June 2020,"Literally, how did this get made?Bruce Willis was originally the lead, but allegedly dropped out in the aftermath of divorce procedures from his wife Demi Moore. He was replaced by Val Kilmer, who had limited availability and unlimited anger issues after he too got divorce papers. Then Rob Morrow quit because the script kept changing. Brando left after his daughter committed suicide and upon his return, he would refuse to learn his lines and only listen to an earpiece.Oh yeah - Richard Stanley also had been fired days into production and replaced with John Frankeheimer, who saw this as anything but his dream project.I mean, what could go wrong at this point?After spending four years developing the films, Stanley had come to work with New Line, who responded by going behind his back to offer the film to Roman Polanski. Furious, Stanley got a meeting with Brando, who unexpectedly - or not, as Stanley had undergone a magick ritual to gain the actor's trust - proved very sympathetic to Stanley's vision. That said, Stanley was beyond familiar with the source work, as well as its connections with Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, which became Apocalypse Now, which still fascinated Brando. Even better, Stanley was directly related to African explorer Henry Morton Stanley, who had been the inspiration for Conrad's lead character - and Brando's role - Kurtz.That said, days into filming, Stanley was having difficulty with New Line executives and Kilmer, who was a legend of ego on this film. At one point, the former Batman burned a crew member in the face with a cigarette.Stanley was fired, but disappeared, finally showing up in dogman costume and acting in the very movie that he was to direct. Oh yeah - the full fury of nature would also destroy much of the set.This movie is an example of actors off the literal rails, with Brando's wearing an ice bucket on his head with the idea that he had mutated into a dolphin and the bucket was to cover up his blowhole. He also pushed for Nelson de la Rosa, the world's smallest man, to be his mutated twin. Brando was obviously in a much better movie than the one that we're watching.Meanwhile, the actors playing Doctor Moreau's children had a better time than anyone else, pretty much using the movie's long periods of downtime getting up to alcohol and drug-addled craziness. Again, they were in a much better film than ended up getting unspooled on the screen.Charitably, this movie is a mess. Would it have been better if Stanley stayed on board? Well, it certainly wouldn't have been boring.",The Island of Dr. Moreau
9,michaelRokeefe,Not natural. The evil doctor must defend his way of making life.,2,10 February 2002,"John Frankenheimer directs another adaptation of H.G. Wells novel. Critics and most movie goers agree this Richard Stanley screenplay leaves a lot to be desired. Hollywood giant Marlon Brando plays the strange Doctor Moreau, who on a remote South Pacific island experiments with humans and animals. Of course the results end in a clan of ""special"" children for the egomaniacal doctor to defend along with his own quirky life style.
Beautiful scenery and haunting background music; but the total weirdness of the story and sluggish dialogue does not a classic make. Brando does nothing more than is expected of him. And in this juncture of his career...all that is required for him is to show up, I guess. Forget about the great actor he was. Val Kilmer does the best he can with what he gets to work with. Sometimes smug; sometimes flat and boring. Also featured are Fairuza Balk, David Thewlis and Ron Perlman.This is really an experiment in viewing. So beautiful and fantastic a vista; but then so crude and ugly the experience becomes. A powerful movie for a special breed.",The Island of Dr. Moreau
10,Theo Robertson,HG Wells And The Acid House,2,10 January 2005,"I first became aware of this remake when a clip was broadcast on Barry Norman's FILM 96 . It's the scene where Dr Moreau ( Marlon Brando ) sits with his animal experiments and tries to justify himself to UN diplomat Edward Douglas played by David Thewlis . The reason the scene stuck in my mind was because Thewlis is best known for his work in British social realism movies so as Douglas points to the animals asking "" What the bloody hell's this all about ? What's he supposed to be ? "" I couldn't help thinking that Thewlis's performance had jumped out of a Mike Leigh movie . Even more bizarelly when Moreau replies "" You expect me to condense seventeen years into seventeen minutes ..."" Brando plays the part exactly - And I mean exactly - as he did as Col Kurzt in APOCALPSE NOW , and all the time the camera intercuts with Moreau's creatures all of whom are giving embarrassed looks . I thought because this clip was shown out of context that may be the reason it looked so ridiculous but unfortunately after seeing the whole movie I can say this is one of the least ridiculous parts of the movie THE ISLAND OF DR MOREAU isn't as well known as some of HG Well's other books like THE TIME MACHINE or WAR OF THE WORLDS but it deserves to be remembered since it deals with humanism , genetic engineering and vivisection . Obviously these concepts were beyond the productions knowledge and we have a film that makes little sense . It goes without saying everything about the movie is bad , the directing is bad , the screenplay is bad and the acting is bad but the worse thing is the way the producers have tried to update the storyline by having much of the action take place in an acid house ! No seriously in order for it to appeal to a 20 something audience Val Kilmer's character ( Who's not really a character - He's just there to spout lines and be used as a plot device ) decides to have an acid house party with his furry friends . No doubt the animals favourite tune is Panic by The Smiths because they decide to hang the bloody DJ and install a new furrier music maker who then shoots anyone who either appears too sycophantic or too critical to his choice of music . The film ends with Douglas escaping after the animal experiments have killed one another in a shoot out Anyone reading this review without seeing the film will no doubt be phoning an ambulance for me . But the events take place on screen exactly as I described them and an ambulance would be better served by being sent to the house of the studio executive who was insane enough to finance this mess",The Island of Dr. Moreau
11,Hey_Sweden,Strictly so-so.,6,31 August 2012,"Third official version of the H.G. Wells novel was such a troubled production that it's fortunate it would be watchable to any degree. In any event, the story of its making is infinitely more interesting than the final result.For those not familiar with the story, it deals with a plane crash survivor, Edward Douglas (David Thewlis), adrift at sea and picked up by a passing ship, and ending up trapped on a remote island where the local mad scientist, Dr. Moreau (a hilarious Marlon Brando) has been busy turning animals into human like abominations. He's just in time to witness as the beasts start tiring of their treatment and stage a horrific uprising, while Moreaus' second in command, Montgomery (an amusing Val Kilmer) goes bat *beep* crazy, and Edward becomes taken with a cat woman named Aissa (sexy Fairuza Balk).This film is never terribly involving, but at least it manages to be a somewhat *intriguing* mess. The ideas at work here still make some impact, although it would have helped had there been a stronger protagonist. Thewlis, who has gone on record as saying this was a very negative experience for him, looks largely disinterested, unlike Kilmer and screen legend Brando (Brando looking very pasty faced and rotund here); they both ham it up something fierce. Balk is quite appealing, and there's also the always welcome presence of Ron Perlman, playing the Sayer of the Law.One good thing that can be said is that the creature designs by the Stan Winston Studio *are* indeed impressive, and the actors buried under the makeup all do a creditable job, especially Daniel Rigney and Mark Dacascos as the scary characters Hyena-Swine and Lo-Mai. This movie is beautiful in a visual sense, so it does have the look of quality, with production design by Graham ""Grace"" Walker and cinematography by William A. Fraker; it was filmed on location in Queensland, Australia.One can't help but wonder what could have been had original director Richard Stanley (the man behind the cult items ""Hardware"" and ""Dust Devil"") not been fired. As it is, legendary political thriller master John Frankenheimer (""The Manchurian Candidate"", ""Seven Days in May""), who was brought in to try to create something releasable, does a slick job, even if his heart wasn't really in it.Fans of the book would be advised to stick with the '32 and '77 adaptations; overall, this film does have good horror movie moments, and ends fairly well, but isn't too memorable when all is said and done.Six out of 10.",The Island of Dr. Moreau
12,LeonLouisRicci,Inconsistent and Intolerable,2,31 October 2012,"A confusing composite of make-ups and performances that border on absurd. Both Brando and Kilmer make their characters behave like they are in a comedy sketch while the rest of the cast and assorted monstrosities are caught in a nightmarish Horror Film.There is literally no depth or exploration of the genetics and cloning science or the morality of it all, just scene after scene of half-breeds running around looking as bewildered as the audience. This has got to be the Director's worst film as he strays wildly from his usual gritty political and crime action dramas and finds himself unable to get a handle on the material.The monster makeup ranges from pretty scary too silly and is as inconsistent as the rest of the proceedings. Nothing at all comes together and the result is a laughable and embarrassing take on the profound H.G. Wells story. The still definitive version is Island of Lost Souls (1933).",The Island of Dr. Moreau
13,zardoz-13,Once More with Moreau,5,9 May 2012,"Sitting through ""Prophecy"" director John Frankenheimer's pretentious horror fantasy ""The Island of Dr. Moreau,"" starring Marlon Brando and Val Kilmer, may be enough to turn anybody into an animal. Presumably, the financial success of recent genetic thrillers such as ""Jurassic Park"" and ""Species"" prompted producer Edward R. Pressmen to reanimate H.G. Wells' literary classic for its third rendition. Ironically, this deeply flawed but imaginatively updated version suffers a fate similar to that of the genetic mutants created by the titular villain on his remote island.The movie opens on three plane crash survivors who have been adrift in the Java Sea for days. Two of them are killed by a shark leaving our hero, Edward Douglas (David Thewlis of ""Naked""), a United Nations peace negotiator. Douglas awakens to the sight of a sailing vessel hovering over him. He collapses from exhaustion and reawakens to find Montgomery (Val Kilmer of ""Tombstone"") attending him. Douglas is too weak to do anything more than swoon. Eventually, the ship deposits them at an exotic island where the research center of Dr. Moreau is located. Montgomery persuades Douglas to join him, on the basis that they have a telecommunications system on the island that Douglas can use to contact the UN. As we soon learn, however, Montgomery is lying. The island is actually the home and refuge of Dr. Moreau, a brilliant geneticist who was forced into seclusion due to his controversial experiments on animals. Moreau has learned how to transform common animals into human beings, or almost human beings. Douglas finds himself trapped on the island, surrounded by Moreau's beastly creations. He tries to escape several times to no avail. First, he stumbles in on an ungodly birth scene, then finds himself in a half-man, half-animal zoo at an abandoned military airfield. Finally, Douglas meets Moreau. They argue about which way the scales of morality should tilt and dredge up Biblical passages to support their arguments. Moreau tries to explain how his experiments will help mankind. He reveals that he has discovered that the devil is a collection of genes. Moreau means to sort out those bad genes and produce an ideal human. He is even willing to accept a failure or two along the road to success, which accounts for the vast number of beast-men. Moreau keeps these ugly creatures under his thumb by means of implants which he uses to shock them into paralysis. Meanwhile, Montgomery keeps the creatures dazed and confused with narcotics.The inventive but predictable Richard Stanley & Ron Hutchinson screenplay updates the 1896 Wells novel and does a good job of establishing the action in the 1990s. The opening 40 minutes introduces audiences to everyone and everything they need to know about the plot. Sadly, the script packs no surprises. If you cannot figure out what's going to happen from one moment to the next in the film then you must be on horse tranquilizers. Suffice it to say, ""Moreau"" doesn't qualify as a date movie, (unless you never want to see your date again). Some of the gruesome looking creatures may even go on to inhabit the island of your dreams. Stan Winston's creature designs are impressive. His mutants look as convincing as mutants could possibly look. Sometimes, they are even nauseating. Typically, they retain the basic shape of the animal from which they were mutated so they have a beastly looking head, hands and feet, while the rest of them is hidden beneath their apparel to conserve on costs. The first grisly glimpse that Douglas gets is a multi-breasted beast mother siring an ""E.T."" infant. The other animals are a hideous collection of mutants with claw hands and snaggled teeth. They gallery of beast men and women appears twice as grisly, gyrating their horrid bodies as Montgomery peddles narcotics to kill them happy. Marlon Brando treats moviegoers to another of his characteristically peculiar performances. There is nothing ordinary about Brando's brilliant but eccentric Dr. Moreau. Brando stages a dramatic entrance, swathed in white garments under a pagoda-style hat, resembling a Japanese Kabuki actor in sunglasses. He tolerates the steamy island heat and wears chalky make-up to preserve his delicate skin from the sun. Metaphorically, this sun allergy relates somehow to Moreau's moral infamy; he cannot stand up to the light of morality. He appears like the great white hope in the camp of the beast men. Brando adopts the same sissified voice that he used for his Fletcher Christian in the 1962 version of ""Mutiny on the Bounty."" He also never appears twice in the same wardrobe. One scene finds him garbed like a nocturnal fridge raider while in another scene he appears bundled up like an Arab sultan. Audiences are meant to identify with the David Thewlis' narrator. Incidentally, Thewlis replaced Rob Morrow of CBS-TV's ""Northern Exposure."" A similar air of mystery clouds Val Kilmer's Montgomery. Montgomery gravitates between moments of extreme clarity and apathetic zombie like drug dazes. Either the script is purposefully vague or (more realistically) the editors sheared Kilmer's performance to reduce the film's running time to 90 minutes so they could squeeze in more showings and parlay a quick profit. Ultimately, Montgomery assumes a Luifer-like character in his apparent rivalry with Moreau. Again, the script doesn't clarify this part of the story. Is Montgomery Moreau's rival? We never know for certain.""The Island of Dr. Moreau"" ranks as an ambitious but flawed horror fantasy. Anybody who relishes Frankenheimer's version of ""Moreau"" can hope that someday New Line Cinema will release a director's cut that restores the lost parts of the film. This well-made but routine concludes with Douglas moralizing about how Moreau's island serves as a microcosm of the world and that we must all go in fear of man's unstable nature. The only thing that audiences can really go in fear of is the sequel that might lie over the horizon.",The Island of Dr. Moreau
14,Boba_Fett1138,What was that?!,3,15 December 2006,"What exactly did I just watched here?To be honest, the movie started of promising. It seemed to have some nice actors and character and above all the movie made SENSE. However the movie started to go down hill rapidly and I mean really down hill!This movie is real wasted potential. The premise is good and interesting and good enough to raise some provoking issues. The actors are also good and so is the visual look of the whole movie (with the exception of its early special effects), with its Stan Winston make-up effects, settings and cinematography. Yet somehow they messed everything up and all of its potential is wasted in this messy, confusing, weird cinematic piece of garbage.It sounds ironic but from the moment when Marlon Brando's character appears in the movie, the movie becomes all quirky, weird and extremely messy. The movie starts to become very unbelievable and toward the end also very far from understandable. Marlon Brando and Val Kilmer are of course great actors but in this movie also unintentional funny and not credible as persons who like to play God. The act like a bunch of idiots in this movie and they do some weird things, Marlon Brando especially, who also looks totally ridicules with weird make-up and odd clothes. In one sequence he even wears an ice bucket on his head! Ice bucket helmet...I rest my case. I think that says enough about how this movie is like. The ice bucket sequences is iconic for the rest of the movie. He is also accompanied by a small dwarf like creature, who wears the same clothes and sits by his right side. It obviously formed the basis and inspiration for the character of Mini-Me in the Austin Power movies. It makes these sequences even more unintentional hilarious to watch.But yet it are still the well known actors who give the movie still some 'watchability level'. David Thewlis was perhaps not the right choice for the main character, he isn't charismatic enough for that but nevertheless he's a great actor of course. Marlon Brando doesn't plays such a prominent role as you would expect. He actually appears quite (too) late into the story. Val Kilmer perhaps delivers the best performance of the movie, until the moment when his character goes crazy. The movie further more features well known actors such as Ron Perlman, Temuera Morrison and William Hootkins in unrecognizable roles.I wish that the movie made more sense. It would at least had made the movie more entertaining to watch. It instead now offers very little entertainment, even to the most objective and open viewers. The way the story is told makes it far from interesting, compelling or thought provoking. If I had to tell what the story is about, I would say; about a bunch of weird like half human-animals who want to break free from their master and 'God', played by Marlon Brando. Everything else gets muddled into the messy story. It makes the movie look like a ridicules potential-less Z-movie from the '50's.Really not worth seeing. I only have one more thing to say, that should sum it all up; Ice bucket!3/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Island of Dr. Moreau
15,anaconda-40658,Animal Crazy!,7,10 September 2015,"The Island of Dr. Moreau (1996): Dir: John Frankenheimer / Cast: David Thewlis, Marlon Brando, Val Kilmer, Fairuza Balk, Temuera Morrison: Remake of the 1977 classic about authority and power over a powerless medium. David Thewlis is boarded onto a ship where Val Kilmer takes him to an island populated by creatures that are half man and half animal. A device is planted within their system that controls them. Concept still works with much suspense but the climax is an ongoing battle that never seems to end. Director John Frankenheimer succeeds in the film's mood but he is hardly matching his work in The Manchurian Candidate. Thewlis fares well amongst the cast as a drifter becoming a prisoner but upon learning the process involved he sets his sights on survival. Marlon Brando is an interesting case as Moreau but his concluding scene was perhaps a tad premature. Val Kilmer is confusing towards the conclusion and unreadable before that. He locks Thewlis in a room and becomes like a different person. Fairuza Balk plays an animalistic female who attempts to help Thewlis but unfortunately her role is nothing more than a romantic tease and a violent dismiss. Whether viewers will prefer this over spending all day watching Animal Planet is up to them. The theme still works regarding our animalistic behavior that traumatize our society.

16,AaronCapenBanner,What A Movie!,5,5 October 2013,"Troubled adaptation of the H.G. Wells novel, directed by John Frankenheimer after he replaced original director Richard Stanly, who wrote the script. Marlon Brando gives an indescribable performance as Dr. Moreau, as if he's barely there at all, looking and acting like a phantom, though it is strikingly original! Val Kilmer is bizarre as his assistant Montgomery, playing it for camp, yet it is an amusing performance. David Thewlis is Edward Douglas, shipwreck survivor who looks every bit as bewildered as the character he's playing. Fairuza Balk is the panther woman Aissa, and she is quite effective, as is Ron Perlman as the Sayer of the law.Film is faithful in spirit to Wells, if not in execution, and though it is far from a success, there is some guilty pleasure enjoyment out of it, and has some striking end narration in its memorable finale.The type of film that was more entertaining to watch than it was to make, if the first hand accounts from the cast and crew are to be believed!",The Island of Dr. Moreau
17,FlashCallahan,there's a robbery at Woolworths........,5,5 August 2011,"Hilarious for all the right reasons, the film is an oddity and well worth seeing, but not for the usual stuff you would expect, but for what was going on behind the scenes whilst it was being made.For what it's worth, the story consists of a man meeting Val Kilmer, who takes him to the titular place, meets Brando, who has combined humans and animals.Brando offers one of them a biscuit, they get vexed by tat, kill him, Kilmer impersonates Brando, Thewlis looks puzzled, and the worlds smallest man is in it. Absolutely crazy stuff.Brando is surprisingly sane in his role as the mad Doctor, and Kilmer, looking as withdrawn as Thewlis, is a hoot as Montgomery, who goes balls to the wall come the end.It's a genuine 'so bad it's good movie', lots wrong with it, but so right in a sadistic sort of way.Poorly edited, crazy narrative, and a feeling of funk all over it. It's worth a trip to this island, just to show how a crazy film set can influence the overall product.This film will be studied for years.",The Island of Dr. Moreau
18,Wuchakk,Troubled production is semi-coherent with some entertainment,5,12 March 2014,"Ever wonder where Col. Kurtz would've ended up had he survived the end of ""Apocalypse Now""? Well, now we know: He exiled himself to a deserted island to create humanimals - the horror, the horror.This 1996 version of ""The Island of Dr. Moreau"" was such a troubled production that articles, books and documentaries have been made about it, like the 2014 documentary ""Lost Soul: The Doomed Journey of Richard Stanley's Island of Dr. Moreau."" Stanley championed the project, wrote the screenplay and was set to direct, but was fired after a few days of filming due to conflicts with Val Kilmer, who wasn't in the best of moods due to being served divorce papers while on set.Actually that wasn't the main reason Stanley was fired. He was fine for small indie productions, but he was out of his league with a blockbuster like this. Veteran filmmaker John Frankenheimer was brought in to save the production from being a complete disaster. He got the job done, but his tyrannical approach didn't help matters.The production was so bad that Fairuza Balk (the cat-lady, Aissa) literally tried to escape the set, but was caught at the airport in the nick of time. Add to this Brando's well-known eccentricities, not helped by the recent suicide of his daughter, Cheyenne, and constant rewrites and you have a formula for a cinematic chaos!In light of the horrible production and the ensuing bad press you would think this would be a lousy movie, but it's actually not THAT bad. I can see why some people don't like it because parts of the third act are pretty crazy and don't flow very well, but if you're a sucker for lost-on-an-island type yarns and appreciate the mood & insanity of films like ""Apocalypse Now"" and the original ""Planet of the Apes"" (""It's a madhouse, a MADHOUSE!"") you'll probably appreciate some of it. Don't get me wrong, it's nowhere near the caliber of either of those films, but comparisons are inevitable and there are entertaining bits.The main problem is that the story isn't that compelling; the flow of the movie is off, which is mostly apparent in the mounting craziness of the final third, which tempts the viewer to tune out.Thankfully, there are some positives. The title sequence is kinetic and dazzling; the score by Gary Chang is varied and all-around phenomenal; the plot is intriguing; the humanimal make-up and actors are quite good with Daniel Rigney's 'Hyena-Swine' standing out (Rigney would be dead a mere year after the film's release); there's some creative pizazz, like Marlon Brando's 35-minute stint where he's as captivating as always, albeit a fat bastage; the inclusion of Dr. Moreau's ""Mini-Me"" is hilarious in hindsight of the Austin Powers trilogy; and there are flashes of nigh greatness, like Edward's revelatory talk with Aissa in the third act.Marlon's Dr. Moreau is a variation of Kurtz, i.e. nutjob in the jungle, albeit twenty years later. For Brando fans it's enjoyable seeing him in his old age. This was one of his final films and it shows that he had his magnetic charm 'til the end.Furthermore, there are some interesting themes: The humanimals who get to live in Dr. Moreau's abode are more human-like in appearance than the animals living in the smelly humanimal 'village' in the forest; the most human-like one, Aissa, he even refers to as his daughter. Wouldn't this lead to tensions between the factions? Moreover, while Moreau is a benevolent dictator he's still a dictator and dictators are rarely good. When Hyena-Swine usurps the crown he immediately becomes a malevolent dictator.The original version runs 96 minutes and the DC 99 minutes. The film was shot in Cairns, Queensland, Australia.GRADE: C+",The Island of Dr. Moreau

20,bensonmum2,"""I wanna go to Dog Heaven!""",5,12 February 2008,"Where to start with this bizarre modern-day retelling of the H.G. Wells' classic? In many respects, The Island of Dr. Moreau is a train wreck of a movie. On so many levels, it's an unmitigated disaster. The problems on the set with the cast and crew are legendary. People getting fired, others getting mad and walking off, and some distracted by personal issues  it must have been like living a soap opera. Maybe it's all these competing issues that helps to make what should be an unwatchable mess so interesting. For all its faults, The Island of Dr. Moreau is actually quite an enjoyable experience.Bizarre would be a good word to describe much of The Island of Dr. Moreau  and I'm not just talking about the events in the movie's plot. The characters are just plain weird. Each appears to be competing with the other to be the most bizarre. David Thewlis' Edward Douglas goes through range of emotions including fear, lust, anger, and disinterest. If it weren't for Marlon Brando, Val Kilmer's Montgomery would be one of the strangest characters in movie history. He's like some sort of butch game-keeper with a death wish. But Brando is in the movie and his Dr. Moreau tops everyone. The scene with Brando in a muumuu and an ice bucket hat is a sight that must be seen to be believed. Words cannot do it justice. Add to that the variety of half-man, half-animal creatures on the island and you've got one strange collection of characters.Speaking of the creatures, the make-up effects are the film's strongest assets. Some, like Hyena or the Sayer of the Law, are as good examples of creature make-up as you'll see. These effects do add a certain creepiness to the whole thing (that is if you can keep from laughing at Brando's latest get-up).Despite enjoying much of the movie, I cannot call The Island of Dr. Moreau a particularly ""good"" movie  not in the traditional sense anyway. The movie has too many problems to do that. The movie is terribly paced, any attempts at drama or horror are usurped by the ridiculousness of the characters, some of the special effects look like they came from a Nintendo 64, and, frustratingly, none of the characters demonstrate anything remotely resembling common sense. As much as I hate to do it, but because of my mixed feelings, I feel forced to give The Island of Dr. Moreau a very wishy-washy 5/10.",The Island of Dr. Moreau
21,Rodrigo_Amaro,Utterly Pointless,3,10 December 2011,"One word to describe this film: pointless. I mean, what was the purpose of this after all? So, cast away David Thewlis lands on this island whose habitants are animals with human characteristics such as speaking and notions of right and wrong, all of them created by the great interpreter of Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), this time as Dr. Moreau, another crazy man living on a jungle who has his own view of the world. Oh, the horror...the horror wasn't here though. It's simply a dull project that has nothing to say and show.Basically, what comes after the arriving of this strange man is a rebellion from part of the creatures that seem to have more power than their ""father"" and this desire of being human, just like us. It's not given much of a reason of why they want that, why this is so important to them. It's very vague! I believe that films that involve science and questions about ethics, humanity and scientific progress versus religion, those films must, at all times, have something great to say, a plausible way to make viewers think ""What if such thing happens? How we would react?"". Those insights are important but they weren't given here. I don't believe H.G. Wells would write a novel just to show an adventure, he must have made more than that, the film failed to capture this. It was nightmare to make this film (just check info at trivia) and it is a nightmare to watch it as well. If the creatures made by Stan Winston are the most enjoyable thing here, the rest is completely absurd by starting with the awful script (if there was one while making this thing), and ending with the waste of good actors like Brando, Val Kilmer (why he had to impersonate Brando as the doctor?) and Thewlis, reduced to playing scary expressions for the whole mess. Fairuza Balk deserves some credit for playing Moreau's creature/daughter, she was good and the actors who play the creatures as well. One of those flicks you can't wait for the ending to come right away once you started. I watched it and didn't like. If I were you I would skip this with no regrets. On the other hand, I know I'm regretting the missed hour and a half... 3/10",The Island of Dr. Moreau

Unfortunately, ""The Island of Dr. Moreau"" earns it's bad reviews the easy way , by being a real stinker of a film. Picture Marlon Brando as a jumbo albino geneticist who controls a nice assortment of grotesque creatures with a TV remote. Do not be confused by any attempt at logic, because there is none. You get Marlon Brando as some sort of huge white god, and then to make matters worse, after his demise, you get Val Kilmer doing a weak imitation of Brando.

26,thinker1691,""" None shall leave the island alive! That is the Law! """,7,19 February 2012,"In 1896, H.G. Wells that incomparable English writer wrote the fantastic novel "" The Island of Dr. Moreau. "" Since then, no less than five film versions have emerged on the silver screen. Beginning in 1913, it was called 'The Island of Terror' and created both heated controversy and moral outrage. Charles Laughton and Bela Lugosi's version was called 'The Island of Lost Souls.' Burt Lancaster and Michael York did theirs in 1977. In this modern adaptation of the same name, we have the late Marlon Brando as Dr. Moreau, Val Kilmer as his assistant, while David Thewlis is the Englishman stranded on that mysterious spit of land. There, he is welcomed as a guest, but unexpectedly discovers a brilliant, but unhinged scientist who has been tampering with hideous DNA experiments. As a result, the entire island is now teeming with animal mutations bent on killing him. Led by noted actors like Ron Perlman as the Sayer of the Law, the movie becomes a fright-fest in terror. Detractors point out, Brando's less than convincing role and his obese size. Never-the-less, there is Stan Winston's extraordinary creations to frighten those not so observant.

He seems to be mutilating these animals for the pure hell of it.They also shoe-in a love story between the protagonist and the panther girl, something all three movies did but H.G.

28,parry_na,Mild spoilers follow ...,7,30 July 2015,"This is adapted from the story by HG Wells in 1896, which was famously filmed as 'The Island of Lost Souls' in 1932, concerning animal/human hybrids.Initially, Douglas's (David Thewlis) disrespectful comments about Moreau's cross-bred children, whilst in their presence, grinds alongside their exemplary manners. Indeed, the agent is told there is not one note of malice in them. However, it soon becomes obvious that Moreau's control over them is far from humane, and the good doctor is – not that there was ever much doubt – insane.Marlon Brando wrestles with an upper-crust British accent and some outsized false teeth. The accent is perfect, the prosthetics less so, rendering occasional moments of dialogue incomprehensible. His performance though, is terrific. Dangerous and a lot of fun. From his first appearance, draped in white, outsized sunglasses and a full face smothered in white 'sunblock', he is delightfully bizarre.The film loses something when Brando's presence is removed, and events become a bit of a jumble. Val Kilmer's Montgomery, who takes Moreau's place, is good, but he's no Marlon Brando.Ultimately, 'The Island of Doctor Moreau' is a thoroughly enjoyable film. David Thewlis (who joined the film after shooting had started, replacing another actor) initially seems miscast as Douglas, but he soon proves himself as the talented actor he is. The same can be said for the various hybrids, most of who really take advantage of the excellent make-up jobs and imbue them with tangible emotion which would be lost if everything was achieved with CGI.It is difficult to ignore the critical mauling the film received, due in part to a series of unfortunate occurrences behind the scenes. Viewed almost 20 years after its release – and I speak as someone yet to see the original Charles Laughton version, so therefore have no other film to compare this to – I found it hugely enjoyable.",The Island of Dr. Moreau

TIODM (yes, that acronym is only a few letters shy of idiotic) is one of Marlon Brando's last and most flat-out enjoyable movies. He's the title character, whose island of macabre experimentation is visited by shipwrecked David Thewlis. Thewlis rightly thinks he's gone insane when he sees what Brando (and crackpot side-kick Val Kilmer) are up to: creating human/animal hybrids and then attempting to keep them under control by implanting shock devices under their skin. Gonzo is the word for John Frankenheimer's adaption of the HG Wells classic. Brando looks even more ghoulish than the monsters he's created driving around in what appears to be a clown car waving to the grotesque throngs. Kilmer is a hoot as well, doing a brilliant Brando impression! The striking Faruza Balk plays Brando's daughter and Ron Perlman is the ""sayer of the law.""

30,MissSimonetta,A mess but not at all one of the worst movies ever,4,13 May 2020,"This movie reminds me of what I felt when watching the infamous 70s film CALIGULA: it's a huge mess where at times you can glimpse the great movie it could have been. Some scenes are genuinely moving, the make-up on the creatures is astounding, Marlon Brando is actually rather brilliant in his campy portrayal of a benevolent tyrant, and the philosophical ideas are present amidst the gore and schlock. But man, the movie is a mess and the plot development is choppy.The first third is a black comedy. It has to be. The goofy characterizations, strange camera angles, and David Thewlis's straight man reactions to the antics of Brando and co. feel like they're out of a Terry Gilliam movie. This part of the movie is genuinely enjoyable. And then in the last two-thirds, the movie suddenly becomes a horror movie, only the tone is still goofy, so the horror doesn't land.THE ISLAND OF DR MOREAU is baffling viewing, but I would not put it in league with the worst movies of all time. It has a touch too much entertainment value for that.",The Island of Dr. Moreau
31,NateWatchesCoolMovies,"Say what you want about it, I enjoyed the hell out of it",8,10 June 2017,"I don't think there's a film out there with a more volcanically troubled production history than John Frankenheimer's The Island Of Dr. Moreau. It wasn't even supposed to be helmed by him, rather an upstart named Richard Stanley, who's control on the creative reigns was violently yanked away by the studio and given to notoriously fiery Frankenheimer, who, lets face it, could never really get his genetically altered ducks in a line when he took over. Between Val Kilmer acting like a lunatic and very nearly being replaced, Marlon Brando being an even bigger lunatic because he knew no one would ever replace him (the big guy had an ego to match his girth) and raging budget problems as a result of the antics, the making of this film was, in short, a straight up disaster. So now I've said my piece on the most talked about aspect of this film, I want to shift gears into an area that just doesn't get covered a lot in discussion: the final film itself. Because of the maelstrom of bad PR circling the film like the storm that maroons our heroes on Moreau's isle, many people just assume it's a bad movie, which is not the case. I happen to love it, and if anything the level of obvious behind the scene chaos seeping through just gives it an organic unpredictability free from shackles of a script that I imagine was fairly generic in the conception phase. This is a bonkers film, no denial from me there, but I'll be damned if I didn't love every certifiable, furry prosthetic adorned, opulent, disorganized minute of it. David Thewlis took over from Kilmer as the lead, when Val had behavioural issues, but they're both present and accounted for as the wreckage of a ship meets Moreau's isle, a twisted Eden where human animal hybrids live under the delirious monarchy of the good Doctor, played with reliably laconic mania by Brando. He's been playing god, the old codger, and his island is now home to a host of varied zoological wonders, and no narrative would be complete without it all going tits up in a giant mutiny later on. The practical effects are delightfully excessive and elaborate, packed onto specifically chosen actors who already have an ethereal, animalistic aura on their own. Ron Perlman is the sagely Sayer Of The Law, Marc Dacoscas the leopardly Lo Mai, Temuerra Morrison the lion like Azazello and wild eyed Fairuza Balk is feline goddess Aissa, who happens to be Moreau's daughter. 'She's a pussy' Kilmer quips in one of many candid slips of the tongue on his part. The inmates eventually run the asylum, or whichever clever parable you want to apply, and it hurtles towards a third act full of flying fur and fangs that releases the floodgates on Frankenheimer's lack of cohesion, the mad scientist workshop of Stan Winston's special effects, Brando's bug eyed dementia and Kilmer's ADHD riddled performance, in one scene going so off far off the rails that Thewlis has to literally break character and tell him to 'quit f%#kin around', an unintentional laugh riot. Brando has a midget Mini Me, too, which is never fully explained but always good for a nervous laugh, as the thing looks like a fetus that vaulted out of the womb a few month too early, although I suppose that's the point. Look, it's a mess, but it's a beautiful one, a kaleidoscopic parade of grotesque costumes and cartoonish performances wrapped up in a story so overblown and off the map it almost takes on a pulse of it's own. For insight on what went down behind the scenes you can read Ron Perlman's autobiography, watch the recent documentary on the film or simply check out IMDb trivia, but whatever went down for real, it ended up branding one of the most bizarre and wonderful creature features of the 90's, and I love every feral, freaky minute of it.",The Island of Dr. Moreau

34,Jonny_Numb,"a muddled, messy, mutated pile of mush...",3,21 January 2006,"A lot of slag has been thrown in the direction of John Frankenheimer's ""Island of Dr. Moreau,"" and with good reason: this is a film (brought to the screen on 2 other occasions, in 1933 and 1977) where nearly nothing goes right over the course of its run time. It's a jumbled mess of a thing, based on the H.G. Wells novel (which I have not read), but astoundingly lacking in the intellect department. White-faced, mountainous 'Godfather of Manimals' Marlon Brando conducts DNA experiments on a remote island, crossing men with cheetah, buffalo, etc. in an attempt to craft a perfect race; Val Kilmer is his constantly overacting assistant; and David Thewlis is the Daft Git who washes ashore and acts completely irrational every step of the way. While trying VERY hard to make profound statements on man, mutation, the manipulation of nature, all we have conveying these themes are gibberish on some 'Law' and Brando being referred to as 'Father.' While the creature effects by Stan Winston are well-done, the movie is so amazingly inept (comeplete with a ""Cannibal Holocaust""-style ending pondering man's savagery) that it doesn't even resonate in a 'so-bad-it's-good' setting...

35,Samiam3,Weird and wonderf.....no actually just weird,5,28 April 2010,"If New Line Cinema had a theme park in the tradition of Universal, (former Paramount Canada's Wonderland) and Disney's MGM studios, I think The Island of Dr. Moreau would make a sensational ride. Based on the novel by H.G. Wells, The Island of Dr. Moreau is supposed to explain one of the key differences between man and beast, man has the ability to create law and order. That said, I personally think it's important to acknowledge that man is not separate from the animal kingdom. We too of course are animals. Sir. Darwin knew it a hundred and fifty years ago, and modern science knows it. Even the church knows but won't accept it. Such a theme has been touched before of course, and actually The Island of Dr. Moreau is the last film I'd recommend to get the message across. this b-grade sci-fi flick is occasionally interesting, and potentially freaky (in the sort of way that dark fairy tales are) but generally, its just reckless and dumbThe curtain rises with a sensational aerial shot of a life raft adrift on a soft blue sea. Three souls are on board, two kill each other in a fight and the third, Mr. Douglas (a UN representative) is left in nature's hands. He is picked up by a small ship and taken to a lush jungle island, where he finds out that the once famed Dr. Moreau has been hiding for seventeen years conducting bizarre experiments of a rather hairy nature. What could the old doctor possibly want with an ordinary guy like Douglas, and why is it becoming increasingly evident that the island ain't gonna let him go.The set-up is very good, but after about forty minutes, the scenario becomes kinda pointless, starting from when we meet the old Doctor. So this where Marlon Brando's career ended up in the last years of his life. The actor who delivered two or three of cinema's most memorable performances ends up dressed like Miriam Makeba, and doing a terribly inept David Attenbourough impersonation. I'm not even sure I'm that sympathetic personally. Val Kilmer and David Thewlis are equally lazy and sloppy in their performances. some of it also has to to with the atrocious dialog they have been given.I'll gives props to Stan Winston and his make-up department for the weird and wonderful beasts on this crazy island. If anything they are a step up from those goofy apes in Congo, (made the precious year). Here, there is a variety of forms and styles, almost as many as there were dinosaurs in Jurassic Park. The creatures themselves are rather emotionally confused it seems, but they all share the wish to be human, like 'the father'. Well, the film favors them in one manner. They get to deliver dialogue as equally cheesy as that of the few humans on the island. It might have been nice if the story got us to care a little more for these guys. There may have been some thematic values there too, a chance to explain how one cannot be judged by its looks. Perhaps the film's intention is to do the opposite, and get us to see them as what they look like; savage beasts. It's really not something worth dwelling on.The Island of Dr. Moreau is a little over ninety minutes, which is about the average length for these sort of movies, but it feels surprisingly short. Among many other things, it is definitely in need of a couple more scenes which focus on character rather than chaos, or motif rather than monstrosity. I think I'm being somewhat generous to The Island of Dr. Moreau. Though not terrible, it is very silly indeed, and perhaps the money would've been better spend on making it a theme park ride after all.",The Island of Dr. Moreau

It catalogs Brando's kinky, neurotic, isolationist, aberrant diva behavior.This movie is pure junk. Stan Winstons latex humanimal costumes are laughable. Why should Brando portray Dr. Moreau as a powder-faced drag queen dressed as a dowager empress? Well he's the coddled Mr. Brando and even at his most assinine he's good for a headline or a scandal. But mostly it's for the most maturbatory reason of all: ""because he can..."" No director can curtail his ridiculous musings if Brando doesn't want to make the movie.The opening credits are amazing because a different source produced them.",The Island of Dr. Moreau
37,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,A sad film that could have been more,4,30 October 2018,"Using big name actors to sell a movie isn't a bad concept. However, using them just because it supposed to sell a bad movie is another thing. It's even worse though when it goes beyond even those intentions. For director Richard Stanley, he was at a point where he was making his way up, and was getting close to the place he wanted to be. His hopes were to create a film based on H.G. Wells Island of Dr. Moreau novel and make it into something that would be totally his, while giving the story a new twist. Unfortunately for him and everyone else on board the movie, nothing worked out the way it supposed to. Stanley was fired not long after filming began, mainly because of the lead stars Marlon Brando and Val Kilmer. However that was just one of the disruptive moments in the process.Amazingly, as bad as things were, the film crew managed to put together a film that isn't too discombobulated. Yet this doesn't mean it's a good movie either. Instead, much of the story comes off lazy, unfocused and board. With Stanley fired, John Frankenheimer was brought in to take over. This didn't help though. While partially working with Stanley's script, Ron Hutchinson (Blue Ice (1992)) was also brought in for rewrites. This furthered the confusion and it shows. While becoming stranded out in the ocean, Edward Douglas (David Thewlis) is picked up by Montgomery (Val Kilmer) and brought to the island of Dr. Moreau (Marlon Brando). What Douglas doesn't know is that Dr. Moreau has been doing twisted experiments, mixing human and animal genes to create new monstrosities.Premise wise, it sounds uniquely horrifying, but that's where it ends. The execution of the plot is very similar to that of something like Planet of the Apes (1968). Dr. Moreau is the one who keeps the order on the island and has a device that remotely controls his creations. Though hiding behind something to control everyone else can prove to be ill advised. What really doesn't help the plot is the whole purpose behind it. Dr. Moreau explains the testing that he's doing, but he doesn't go into detail on how it'll benefit anyone outside his reach. He was outcast to that island because his actions were so controversial. As for characters, there's really very little to get behind. David Thewlis as Edward Douglas is a sympathetic character but there's not a lot of focus on him. Instead much of the attention is given to Marlon Brando and Val Kilmer.Being that Dr. Moreau is played by Brando, it could be understood as to why he would have more screen time, but Kilmer's character is just bizarre. He explains how he got in contact with Dr. Moreau but that's it. The rest of Kilmer's performance is all over the place. It's difficult to tell whether he was acting or being lazy. Brando, although a credible actor, does seem disengaged at times. He does give a sense of mystery to the doctor, but it's only for a short while. This is the unfortunate bit, being that the marketing went on about having Val Kilmer and Marlon Brando being the faces of the movie, when there was more to it. Plus, David Thewlis' role had more significance. There are other actors viewers may recognize like Fairuza Balk, Temuera Morrison, Ron Perlman and Nelson de la Rosa.The real positive things that can be said for this creature feature were the visual aspects. The makeup effects crafted by master Stan Winston was spot on. Making the combination between human and land animal type features can be tricky, but Winston made it look easy. Sort of like a 180 degree turn from his work on Leviathan (1989), which involved human and marine life mixing. The cinematography shot by William A. Fraker was decent. With filming locations coming from Queensland Australia, the jungle terrain looks legitimate. Fraker also worked on 1941 (1979), Tombstone (1993) and Waking Up in Reno (2002). Lastly, the music composed by Gary Chang was an intriguing element. The tracks heard are reminiscent to that of his score from Sniper (1993), but thankfully, he gives this film its own theme. Not to mention, it got its own release which is rare for him.Sadly, the premise, makeup effects, cinematography and music cannot save the wildly unfocused performances by the cast. It may feature heavy hitter names, but they don't save the feature after all the trouble it went through. The plot execution isn't even that unique.",The Island of Dr. Moreau

The crazy scientist says lots of things but does not speak anything at all. They are all just vague sentences that don't interest the spectator. The only decent thing in this film are the special effects. Until the 55 minutes I watched, there is no such thing as horror or action, just a bunch of animal-people grunting and moving freaky. Marlon Brando is a waste; a good actor like him could've made a good film to avail his talent, but what can I do about it...",The Island of Dr. Moreau
39,tomsview,Method in the madness,7,11 July 2021,"To get the most out of this film, it's best to watch it in conjunction with ""Lost Soul: The Doomed Journey of Richard Stanley's Island of Dr. Moreau"" a 2014 documentary about its making.Questions about how the movie ended up so crazy are answered in often hilarious detail. Yes there is an explanation as to why Marlon Brando as Dr. Moreau wears an ice bucket on his head in a bizarre scene.I didn't know anything about Richard Stanley, the original director who was sacked and replaced, until I read the information on IMDb trivia after watching the movie. Much of that information comes from the documentary.Like the 1977 version of the story, the film is based on H. G. Wells' novel where Dr. Moreau retreats to a remote island to put into practice his theory about creating humans from animals. The story is told from the point of view of a sailor who ends up on the island and witnesses the good doctor's work unravel as the creatures regress and tear up the joint.This version sticks closer in some ways to the basic structure of the book, but overlaid with the original director's vision of updating it to the present. The makeup and special effects are also many notches above the 1977 version.However it was the actors that sent the film off kilter, and that's where the fun really started. Few mainstream Hollywood movies ever went as completely out of control as this one. What becomes obvious in the documentary as you watch the interviews with the actors and crew is that they could dine out for years on the stories they have to tell - most of which revolve around Marlon Brando.Marco Hofschneider who played one of the creatures proves to be a brilliant raconteur as he describes interactions he had with the legendary actor. Fairuza Balk who was a supporter of the original director, and seemed traumatised by the experience tells of a conversation with Marlon where she actually does a brilliant impression of him. All were provided with pure gold for a lifetime of anecdotes, and reveal that what went on behind the camera was more entertaining than anything in front of it.The 1996 version is a mess and wears out its welcome before the end, but when you know why it ended up like that, it could be the most enjoyable movie you'll watch all year.",The Island of Dr. Moreau
40,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,What the hell was that?!,3,6 August 2020,"This movie was the byproduct of a troubled production cycle involving two directors clashing with the studio, Marlin Brando and Val Kilmer and the rest of the cast wanting to get out of the movie desperately. No one in this film seems like they want to be there AT ALL; David Thewlis looks like he's about to cry from realising the embarrassment this will give him for his career, and Marlon Brando looks like he's the most care-free arse on the planet whenever he's on camera hamming up his appearance to the extreme. How the hell did this movie get finished and then released? It's incomprehensible; the plot makes no sense, the characters go back and forth with their logic and the direction is unsure if the movie wants to be a body-horror or comedy.And to top the absurdity of the movie off it's bookended by narration that tries to give meaning to the nonsensical experience we just witnessed. It tries hammering the relevance of men playing god by using newsreel footage at the end of the movie. The big problem though? Nothing happened in the movie to warrant using this commentary at all. It's just an overblown adaptation of a HG Wells story that could have been a good experience if the production wasn't such an outright disaster from start to finish.This movie is a classic 101 in what NOT to do in Hollywood moviemaking: and it's bound to be a token example for years to come.",The Island of Dr. Moreau
41,CharltonBoy,Don't listen to the critics,7,11 July 1999,I Started watching this film expecting the worst after reading the reviews for it and I ended up enjoying this film a lot. The photography is stunning in places which makes up for the weak storyline. Marlon Brando is great in this film it's a shame Val kilmer is disinterested in making a go of it.The Monsters are superb I especialy liked the the little guy who dressed like the doctor. 7 out of 10,The Island of Dr. Moreau
42,DarthBill,Pretty bad,4,9 July 2006,"Marlon Brando is the mad scientist who tries to breed a race of creatures that are part human and part animal with horrifying results. Val Kilmer is an eccentric assistant (he was originally supposed to be the film's hero but his divorce prompted him to switch parts). David Thewlis is the hero who gets caught up in all this nonsense. Fairzu Balk is the ill-fated heroine. Ron Perlman is the Sayer of the Law. Based on the book.Alas, this is one of those films that just doesn't come together. An ambitious film, yes, but ultimately an unsuccessful one. Even the normally reliable Val Kilmer is bad here, and that's saying something. So is the late Marlon Brando, though David Thewlis, Fairzu Balk and Ron Perlman aren't too bad. I can only imagine that the film suffered from off screen turmoils, such as the many changes in writing, directing, the now legendary off screen problems between Val Kilmer the late director John Frankenheimer; I can only assume that Kilmer's inner pain from his divorce must have gotten in the way.Point of interest: the film features three men who have been involved in comic book adaptations. Brando was Jor-El, biological father of Superman in the 1978 Superman film, Kilmer was the 5th actor to play Batman, and Perlman later played Hellboy. Seeing the three of them together may just be enough to merit a rental but not much else.",The Island of Dr. Moreau
43,Agent_Iris,A colossal train wreck,1,29 October 2020,"This is one of the worst films that I have ever seen. It is so completely disjointed, nonsensical and bush league. H. G. Wells must have been spinning in his grave.The drama behind the making of this film is far more interesting than the film itself. The first director was fired, promptly destroyed all his production notes, had a nervous breakdown and disappeared into the Australian wilderness; Marlon Brando refusing to learn his lines and insisting on being force fed them through a hidden earpiece; Val Kilmer being a total diva and questioning every decision the director made; Marlon Brando's mini-me sexually harassing female cast and crew members; Marlon Brando insisting on wearing a giant ice bucket on his head because he was hot; the leading lady absconding to the airport in an attempt to flee the country and film shoot...I could go on, but I think you get the idea.Having said all that, if you watch this film as a comedy, it is incredibly enjoyable. You could argue that it is a proof of concept for The Room.",The Island of Dr. Moreau
44,perfectbond,Hard to evaluate,6,27 May 2004,This film has been savaged by most everyone that has seen it. I haven't read the book or seen any of the other versions yet so I have no other references. I actually found the movie relatively interesting considering the negativity surrounding it and was reasonably enlightened by the film's main theme of the consequences of man playing God. Marlon Brando was just bizarre as Moreau though it isn't out of the realm of possibility that a man like that would be exceedingly eccentric. His relationship with his mutant daughter is disturbing and moving. Val Kilmer's character is a bit of mystery. David Thewlis does quite well in portraying a character in an unimaginable situation. The special effects and makeup to create the grotesque human-animal hybrids was done quite well I thought. I want to see the other versions to see how this film really handled the material.,The Island of Dr. Moreau
45,artzau,Ghastly!,2,9 February 2001,"Take a cast of fine actors, a classic horror story from the guy credited with having invented the genre of science fiction, amazing effects and some startling cinematography and you come up with a winner, right?  No. This is a stinker of a movie.  Why?  Because they screwed up the script with a lot of absolute nonsense which completely misses the point of H.G. Wells orthogensis of animals forced into human form.  The classic ""Island of Lost Souls"" with Charles Laughton and Bela Lugosi's haunting ""Are we not men?"" is absent from this parody of a tale, as is the seamy remake with competent performances by Burt Lancaster and Michael York.  Terrible performances by Brando and Kilmer matched by the hammy struting of Thewlis coupled with this garish script add up to a disappointment.  I have to look hard for any pluses and can only think of Balk's gorgeous, provocative Balinese dancing interrupted by Thewlis, and Brando's remark, upon hearing the monsters banging on the piano, that it sounds like Schoenberg.

52,Aly200,Wells's Classic Story can't save this train-wreck,3,10 July 2016,"One needs to have a serious sense of humor to watch this epic disaster of a movie which I luckily have about this film.This reboot of H.G. Wells's classic mad scientist tale maintains its roots in the original material. The story is straightforward in staying relatively faithful to the novel on which it is based. As with every book to screen adaptation there is of course Hollywood changes such as adding in a love interest for the hero. Sadly that lowers the quality of the story a bit, but does not derail the plot.What does hurt the film is its horrendous miscasting of the lead roles. The story of switching cast members around on this project is highly infamous. In particular is the switch of star Val Kilmer from the film's hero to the film's secondary antagonist; this was at the actor's request due to his on- set rampage over personal issues that he took out on his fellow actors and the crew. Kilmer is not convincingly villainous as Montgomery, rather a crude caricature of a wannabe baddie. Taking Kilmer's spot as the hero, Douglas, is a terribly miscast David Thewlis after actor Rob Morrow bowed out due to the chaotic nightmare of the film's delaying production. Thewlis is visibly uncomfortable in the lead role that it shows during the entire film. And finally in a disastrous turn as the mad Dr. Moreau was the infamously uncooperative Marlon Brando (he won the Razzie for Worst Supporting Actor over co-star Val Kilmer for the film). Brando clearly demonstrates his lack of preparation for the role as he recites dialogue just as someone reading it to him; one of Brando's infamous tactics in all his later work. Chemistry between all members of the cast is absent and is completely evident from the start.I do recommend seeing this film more for the notoriety of the production process. It's one bad ""B movie"" though like a ""D movie""",The Island of Dr. Moreau

Well, bearing this in mind and witnessing a long 96 minutes of this movie, makes one wonder just exactly what went wrong? Something did go terribly wrong, and I don't mean the good doctor's experiments, either. What proceeds to spew forth from the film is a jumbled, loosely-knit, campy collection of scenes strung together. The only things this film has going for it, is the some good special effects. The music by Gary Chang is haunting and bizarre. The rest of the movie, you can pretty much skip. Of course, we know this isn't exactly John Frankenheimer's fault, as the first director left before the project was completed. Don't even bother to look for a hint of continuity, or you will go as mad as Brando's character is supposed to be. Speaking of the marvelous Marlon, where DID they dig his costume up? He was a wig short of impersonating Divine. I had to ponder what effect this portrayal would have on the sale of muumuu's.

It's also a great deal of fun to watch Thelwis and Kilmer try to figure out how to cope with the maniacal scene-stealer in their midst. The original director threw up his hands after a couple of weeks and turned the production over to a comparative novice, who also had no idea how to handle Marlon.

Now, unfortunately, I have not seen the original Island of Dr. Moreau, but if it's better than this, it must be one of the best movies ever made. And, contrary to popular commentary, Marlin Brando played his role better than any actor I can think of. He was the father of the creatures, and he acted like it. And that little guy. Oh, he was great. I just wonder who they got to play him. But the whole movie was really worth the two hours I spent watching it on TV.

Then what you have is the lighter side of Apocalypse Now but with deadly truth of inescapable fact that we may one day be genetically engineered and owned by corporations is not at all far fetched. Already Monsanto owns GMO Corn, Rapeseed and even pigs. Cows injected with Bovine Growth Hormone o produce more milk. What prevents them to own a pig face humans made from pigs with human genes added? It's the effect of that day of Armageddon and it strikes me what happens if one day Monsanto owned genes accidentally made their way into humans from contaminated GMO foods and courts demand we humans to pay royalty fees to the companies much like the case where GMO seeds accidentally made into an unfortunate farmer in Canada, as in the documentary ""The Future of Food"", then you have a somewhat somber view of the movie in a new perspective and it's serious human perspective of the effects of bioengineering gone wild, with the legal protection of the court - the skies the limit. Why would the Island of Dr. Monsanto be confined to just this small island when Dr. Monsanto is already doing a great job in U.S. Canada and the world on a much larger scales. Could it be said that they have already done so with Monsanto being the patent owners of Pigs and Cows, with a human gene that produces a nutritious human milk coming straight from a cow?

A film legend if you remember A street car named desire and the gangster epic the godfather. But i just bought it and sat in and watched it.I was moderately entertained. Marlon Brando was quite good and everyone elses performances were good.The story is about a man stranded at sea who is brought to an island where animal DNA is fused with human DNA to make hybrids.

This is a film which has a lot to say about society, a fact which more than a few SF slacker fans could not appreciate. This version of Welle's classic story was filmed in the mid-90's when the world was in uproar over the Bosnian conflict. I'm bringing this fact up because I think that this film --aside from the usual 'don't mess with God's creation' crap -- was trying to make a statement about international and domestic relations, about how the more governments try to interfere with international and domestic policies, the more they foul it up. Hewlitt's U.N. peace-keeping negotiator character reminded me of the U.N.'s inneffectual stance in Bosnia, something which I don't think was a mere coincidence. His character is laughably inneffective in dealing with the tensions at hand, just like the U.N. in real life.The mutated animals Moreau created have a suspiciously ""ethnic"" look to them...could it be that Frankenheimer was trying to make a statement about our governement's inneffectual domestic policies toward the underclass?

I love Fairuza Balk as one or Marlon Brandos 'children' Val Kilmer plays Marlons second in command with a sort of freakiness that he exuded in his role as Jim Morrison. The other creature/people successfully created by Stan Winston made me feel sad in their grotesqueness as they moved around on two and four legs both hoof and claw.

It's widely regarded as one of the worst films in history, and in many ways it is, if you consider the quality of the cast, director and budget.But revisiting it 20 years later after seeing the interesting documentary ""Lost Souls"" about this car crash of a movie, I didn't find it quite so bad. It's poor, no doubt about it, but it's not tedious and mind numbing in a Battlefield Earth kind of way and nowhere near real dross like Batman & Robin or The Spirit. It's entertaining for many reasons, chief among them being Marlon Brando's blatant trolling of the entire production, insisting on wearing white make up and using buckets instead of hats to keep his head cool. His performance is worth the admission alone.The rest is worth watching for the implosion of Val Kilmer's career as an A-List actor. Fresh from the success of films like The Doors, Batman Forever and Heat he was apparently extremely arrogant during the making of this film, and he just oozes apathy in every scene he's in. If he truly was as insufferable as he's been accused of in ""Lost Souls"" then karma certainly paid him a visit here, as his career never recovered from this wreck. Fairuza Balk is decent and tries her best with weak material, Ron Perlman is solid as always, but David Thewlis is miscast, his North England accent and bad teeth detracting from his performance.

Not quite godzilla pitiful, but very close.  The performances of Brando as Moreau and Kilmer as his assistant are bizarre.  Instead of being grand, Brando comes off as an absent-minded diva.  Instead of being menacing, Kilmer is smirky and chipper as he wanders through the plot looking for something to do besides mumble some expository info.  Thewlis looks  embarrassed to be there, both as an actor in a disaster and as character that just wandered into a colony run by a flamboyant moron and his aggravatingly dim mutant pets.The source material itself is questionable.  Why would anyone want to dramatize the great colonial father trying to civilize the natives? Because this is such a squeamish thing to talk about these days, Wells' story is eviscerated and retold as an almost antique B-movie rerun about a mad scientist who plays god and how humans are more beastly than animals.  And, yes, and the poor narrator solemnly intones these Vincent Price genre cliches at the end of the film.  There are hints that the screenwriter was working within Wells' theme - many elements of the story and art direction suggests a third world tourist trap and military client state.Kilmer does a really endearing Brando impression.  The editing and narrative pacing in this film is almost as bad as Battlefield Earth. Almost.",The Island of Dr. Moreau

68,mark-rojinsky,Enterprising science-fiction/adventure film with serious underlying issues,5,22 July 2020,"Produced in the second half of 1995 in tropical Queensland this science-fiction film has the ambition of an 'adventure' film and deals with serious contemporary issues such as fears of genetic engineering/mutation, aggressive tendencies in the human and animal world and the context of nature. The visual props/relationships are amazing:- skulls of exotic animals, interesting framed high-quality acrylic/oil paintings and murals, classical busts, the light wooden hues flanking the walls in Moreau's house, sophisticated lighting- super-bright electric Cambridge-blue and pure neon white colours and shimmering chrome props and tubes and scientific hardware, the deployment of 17th/18th-Century baroque oratorios and Balinese music in the background. In appearance Brando is tubby - he sports a golden/green silk kimono, bandanas, granny glasses, steel wristwatch and cropped silver hair and re-deploys the preposterous upper-crust English accent of his Fletcher Christian (Mutiny on the Bounty (1962)) and Sir William Walker (Burn! (1968-1970)) - which were adventurous flairful performances. Young Lancastrian actor David Thewlis (Naked (1993)) shows Northern English common sense. The special effects - explosions, makeup, costumes etc are very impressive. The opening credits are sensational - a montage of embryos, cells, aggressive spermatozoa, flashing vulpine eyes, moody pinkish/brown tropical skies, screeching animal cries etc while William Fraker's digital video camerwork is pin-sharp.",The Island of Dr. Moreau

71,ferreira0665,I liked it.,6,28 August 2000,"This movie reminded of Jurassic Park. This movie was I believe more realistic but not as good. 1) Jurassic Park's plot was based off this movie. How I know, DNA research. H. G. Well's book was written in 1899 or around there. Jurassic Park was written in the late 1900s.2) This movie I thought was a lot more doable. You can't take any mosquito and magically find just Dino DNA in it. It just doesn't happen. You can mix human and normal animal DNA more easily because of the fact they are both alive today.3) Yes, this movie was a whole hell of a lot more depressing. JP ended with a kind of sad but relatively happen ending. Now, face it, a lot of things in this world do not end happily ever after. The world is not a fairy tale. Things don't always end happy.4) The character's were majorly changed between the book and the movie of JP. The JP Owner was more of an a**hole in the book and gets killed. Certain other didn't die as they did in the book. The Island of Dr. Moreau had a mad scientist who was portrayed well, and had a Montgomery who you could tell was mad five minutes into the movie. Then there was Edward Douglas who played a role of being amazed by what the scientist was doing. To tell you the truth, his attitude wasn't out of line. If you telling certain people you are their father, why would you hurt your own children horribly more than they deserved. Montgomery and Dr. Moreau did not get along but ate together, which means they hid their differences when in a group of other people. Which is more of a professional way to handle a situation. Fairuza Balk played a very sweet person, Aissa, whom did not like the changes she was going through. I believe everybody did an excellent job in acting. I do agree with most of the comments that say that the killing of the father may have been a little too graphic. If I was in this movie I would have liked to played Val Kilmer's role. His role was hella funny. Both movies had the same motto. ""Life finds a way. You can't control everything.""5) Everything in JP was theory. Things in The Island of Dr. Moreau could probably actually happen. They will probably never ever have a Dinosaur Park in this world at any time in the future. It wasn't an excellent film but wasn't horrible either.",The Island of Dr. Moreau

Throughout the film Edward plays a voyeuristic role and like him we all become spectators and see all the spooky events that happen during the island, the FX's and makeup are great, a good mixture of suspense and horror/survival in this remake, the fact that Edward is the only character that stays alive in the end made me happy!Cons: Obviously a movie of this type will always leave a lot to be desired, it is somewhat uncomfortable that Val Kilmer and Marlon Brando are just the biggest names trying to sell this film believing that it will not be disgusting because their characters are very stereotyped!

I was never sure why. It opens strong, both visually and musically. The locale is beautifully claustrophobic, appropriate for a secluded tropical island. Stan Winston's creature make up is excellent. The body language of the ""humanimals"" is very interesting. The underlying commentaries on the savagery of society and the morality of biological scientific experimentation are intact. Marlon Brando makes a daring, and critics said poor, choice in playing his Moreau like an effete, physically feeble, unbelievably polite British University English Professor, more eccentrically insane instead of the usual madly insane. Val Kilmer, always a strong performer, as Moreau's assistant Montgomery, does a spot on impersonation of him toward the end of the film. Fairuza Balk, as Moreau's daughter Aissa and David Thewlis as the ""rescued"" diplomat Edward round out the over all well done performances given by all.

77,MikeSmash,Dr. Moreau is Dr. Ridiculous!!!!!!!!,3,12 January 2006,"""The Island of Dr. Moreau"" made a mockery of the late Marlon Brando's talent & legacy. H. G. Well's incredible novel adapted to the Hollywood screen was better served in the 1977 version than this utterly ridiculous 1996 version. The story is based on an account by ship wreck survivor Edward Douglas(David Thewlis), English diplomat on a peace settlement. Montgomery, vet & Moreau confidant, finds Douglas adrift in the Red Sea adrift a bloody raft. Douglas arrives on Moreau's Island, where he soon learns what the good doctor is REALLY doing in his seclusion. Douglas is told that a radio is available to call for help & a ship will arrive shortly. Douglas meets the beautiful Aissa(Fairuza Balk), Moreau's daughter. Douglas is shown to his room by Montgomery where he is locked in for ""his own good."" Having escaped, Douglas creeps up on a horrible operation & many caged animals. What Douglas discovers is the horror of science realized in half human/half animals created by Moreau. These poor creatures are subdued by shock implants & live by Moreau's pseudo-moralistic Laws for Men. The group of creatures are led by Sayer of the Law, a Ram headed blind man who preaches Moreau's rules of conduct to the masses. Dr. Moreau is creating monsters with science, being the same man who received the Nobel Peace Prize for inventing Velcro?!? Go figure!!!! As the doctor preaches the Law to the beasts on man's good behavior, a beast kills a rabbit & consumes it voraciously. Dr. Moreau finds out & holds a mock trial to flush out the culprit. Lo-Mai the Cheetah, guilty & frightened, lashes out at Moreau. Moreau shocks Lo-Mai into submission & forgives him. Lo-Mai takes a bullet to the head by Azazello & now the beasts realize that violence equals power. Hyena-Swine goes to the kiln where Lo-Mai is cremated & finds a shock implant on the cheetah's femur. Realizing what he found, Hyena-Swine pulls out his own shock implant & knows he can no longer be forced into submission by Moreau's shock control unit. With a few other aggressive animals with him, Hyena-Swine plots to kill Moreau & control the beasts on the island. All the while, Moreau continues his work despite the turmoil surrounding him.Douglas tells Moreau at dinner that his work is ""destruction & debasement"" of the worst kind. Moreau defends his work stating that ""I have seen the devil in my microscope & I have chained him. Metaphorically speaking, I have cut him to pieces. I am closer to perfecting the human species than you could possibly imagine, sir."" Of course, Montgomery adds insult to injury by requesting rabbit fricasse instead of the usual vegetarion diet practiced on Moreau's island. During a routine med distribution, Montgomery realizes that Hyena-Swine is a loose cannon when the torn away shock implant is shown. Hyena-Swine runs & teaches his cohorts to rip out their shock implants. Planned & carefully executed, Hyena-Swine & friends invade Moreau's main house to let him know that the animals will be taking over. Dr. Moreau is attacked savagely & is murdered. Douglas threatens Montgomery to give him the serum to stop Aissa's regression to no avail. Montgomery is subsequently murdered by Azazello who was ordered by Hyena-Swine. War is declared, with Douglas (David Thewlis) & Aissa(Fairuza Balk) fighting for their lives. Aissa was Moreau's finest work but her ""cat animality"" was taking over. With no serum, Aissa's womanly appearance begins to take on a feline persuasion. Jealous of her favor with the Father, Aissa was murdered by her brother Azazello, leaving Douglas to fend for himself. Captured by Hyena-Swine's minions, Douglas is brought before the devious hyena to convince the animals of his superiority. Knowing of Hyena-Swine lust for power & yearning to be a god, Douglas tricks Hyena-Swine into the trap of his own lust for power & turns his brethren against him. The mad hyena is beaten by the others & throws himself into a fiery building. With a following day of raft building & supply gathering, Douglas prepares to leave Morea's island. Monkey man Assassimon begs Douglas to stay & Sayer of the Law refuses help to reverse the scientific damage caused by Moreau. According to Sayer of the Law,""To go on two legs....is very hard. Four is better, anyway."" Douglas finally left the island with a warning for all those who would follow in Moreau's footsteps. ""...and I go, in fear.""Brando's Dr. Moreau was simply dreadful, as well as Val Kilmer's completely assonine performance as Montgomery, the beast people's jailer. Thewlis & Balk were surprisingly good in their performances with the rest of the cast floundering in the jungle abyss. Such a waste of acting talent & film!!!!!!Unless you just like to be insulted by horrible remakes & silly beast make-up work, grab your popcorn & soda. But remember, I warned you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",The Island of Dr. Moreau
78,bioscoopzaal,Interesting but irratic,4,16 June 2000,"On paper this project must have looked like the real thing. A great novel being made into a film starring Val Kilmer and Marlon Brando. But in reality, this film turned out quite the opposite. It is rather pointless and boring, which hurts me to say, because I rather enjoyed the book. The many problems this film has are supposedly due to infinite clashes between the studio and the director, who eventually abandoned the project, leaving a vacancy for John Frankenheimer, who finished the picture. I guess it must be hard to finish a project that you haven't been involved in from the start, and it really shows. The scenes with Val Kilmer are painfully over the top, and David Thewlis and Fairuza Balk are not quite sure what they are doing either. The plot is practically non-existent, but it must have something to do with cloning, since they have an island with a giant laboratory on it for the purpose of ""designing"" new species of animals. Which brings me to few redeeming features of this film, being the phantastic special effects and animatronics (kudos to Stan Winston) and a truly dazzeling central performance by Marlon Brando, who seems to be born to play the role of the God-like Dr. Moreau. He delivers his (what appears to be) unrehearsed dialogue with such stunning ease, that it reminded me why he truly is one of the best actors of his generation. But apart from these highlights, some stunning photography and an unforgettable scene between Dr. Moreau and a midget (later successfully spoofed by Mike Myers in ""The Spy Who Shagged Me""), this film doesn't really have much going for it. Which is a shame, since it had so much potential.",The Island of Dr. Moreau
79,lbk,Quite another view on a gem run over by a review truck,10,31 July 1998,"All reviews and votes for The Island of Dr. Moreau judge this as a bad movie. I disagree!If you think positive characteristics of a film are - unconventional - no Hollywood sob - no bleeding heart romance greased all over the actual theme - explore the main theme (in contrary to films which ""have it all"" ) - offbeat - realistic within the predefined frame, this one is a gem. It is what I call a ""clean"" movie: few cliches and lot of room for reflection. The action scenes at the end comes close to cliches but are plausible within the framework though and therefore spoils nothing.An example of a very unusual filming is that the main characters die without lingering close-ups, sobbing and famous last words. They die as they die because its on line with the situation and mind of the characters.The themes of gene manipulation, the persistence of instincts, morfologi, the flexibility of biology and human lack of broadsight (and insight) is handled with intelligence in a thought provoking manner - and that is rare in a movie.Dr. Moreau brilliantly portrayed by Marlon Brando may be mad in the eyes of everybody but he has a kind of broadsight (and insight) that is fascinating. If you have read and liked any books by the gene scientist Richard Dawkins (The Selfish Gene, The Blind Watchmaker, The Extended Phenotype) who has theories on biology as profound as Darwins theories, this film is it!",The Island of Dr. Moreau
80,Quinn-5,An Enjoyable Movie...,9,13 September 1998,"For whatever reasons, a segment of the higher-up film reviewing community did not like this movie. Following that segment's lead, countless others jumped aboard the bandwagon following their lead, and thus the film 's bad press was born. Being a film critic myself and not a big John Frankenheimer fan, I think I am capable of giving a fair review here and saying Frankenheimer's first theatrical effort in years was quite enjoyable. Suspense, tragedy and even humor all make it into this H.G. Wells remake about an exiled scientist played by Marlon Brando who conducts whacky experiments on DNA and animal cells to create an island of shunned species, half animal, half man. It plays like a good X-Files episode, with David Thewlis as our haggard Agent Mulder, playing a U.N. worker stranded on the island of classic Frankenheimer wide-lens shots. Val Kilmer tunes down his annoying level for most of the film as Moreau's right-hand man gone awry.

The movie was sorta interesting especially it got Val Kilmer and Marlon Brando. Now that I've been able to watch it thanks to Comcast's on-demand, well I certainly didn't miss much. The movie pretty much was so and so. So many of the actors' talent was wasted by the director and I heard there was some clashes with the director and the cast.

You don't look like anything"". Outstanding photography, effective tropical suggestibility (you can almost feel the humidity), excellent animal make-up, some truly memorable scenes (the birthing scene, the Hyena-Moreau confrontation) and even a sense of philosophical examination.

83,Cioran,not nearly as bad,8,19 November 2000,"This film was not nearly as bad as judging from the comments by some Americans. Acting was good, dilemmas were relevant, only thing seriously lacking was contextualization. Characters weren't historically well contextualized to make their activities coherent. Action wasn't founded but happened unexpectedly out of nowhere . It gave a chaotic sense to the film. Calling this film boring is totally off base. This is not a boring film. It just tried to encompass too many complex topics into a relatively brief film: animalistic brutality, confusion of origins, the frustration of many unanswerable questions to existence and suffering, the fragility of civil society and the often rigid adherence to laws to maintain a community. The film portrayed the dilemmas of human condition, suspended somewhere  between gods and animals.

And I agree with those others who said the story line held up well for being 100 years old.I look upon the beasts as Palestinians who are mistreated and rebel. Yet they do so by destroying the society around them. There is the Ghandi appeal of the underground dwellers (the blind sage); but the wild killers win out and destroy much of what is there. And the few educated animals (again read Palestinians) are left without the society that an educated person needs and wants.And, like the Palestinian conflict, there is a cycle of violence that continues, even when there are moments where peace can prevail (when Brando pardons the killer creature).I guess I am writing for the moment, instead of for all time, but on the NBC news today and yesterday (Monday, July 10, 2006), an Iraqi woman (Sunni) whose kid is killed asks ""Is this Islam?"" A good question. I would say ""Yes, it is Islam."" Although, if you go to Ireland, you could have a mother cry out ""Is this Catholicism?""

David Thewlis is a dependable actor in his role of a U.N. official lost at sea. Val Kilmer steals every frame he speaks in with his role of the resident doctor, who slowly goes insane as the animals take over. Marlon Brando is like a nicer, but crazier version of Colonel Kurtz.

While it embarks on a modern telling of the classic novel, so many elements remain timeless due to the nature of its construction that the timeframe can be oblique. As the movie was in the infancy of CGI, special effects are practical and rather impressive. The story itself it a bit mucked, and the acting of the three leads are practically phoned in, but it's still unique stuff.

I'm as dumbfounded as you are over my existence in this movie. what can you do?I'm stuck here just like you are, but cut me some slack, you're only watching. I am in this thing!"" Throughout the movie this little thing is just sort of there. At one point he's lounging around and flashing his mutant butt like we are at a photo shoot for midget mutant porn.Midget Mutant porn would be a better thing to watch.This movie is a crazy train going off the rails into a black hole that is at the center of a volcano populated by insane clown posse demons. Kilmer and Brando.. appear to giving us, Hollywood, Earth, and reality itself a huge ""F*CK YOU."" Sarcasm mode on.My friend and I both agreed, however, that the decision to have Val Kilmer play 13 different characters who all dressed the same and went by the same name was brilliant! the only way you could tell he was different is how he would behave completely different, and then you said ""aha GENIUS! he's playing one of the other characters now!""

88,yoyodinepropulsion,Worse than bad (or better?),1,23 November 2003,"Here's a rare case of a film that's not only bad, but incompetant (Only ""The Avengers"" comes to mind as another recent example). The fact that original director Richard Stanley was fired only days into the shoot, and that a pouting Val Kilmer was allowed to run loose pretty much self-destructed this film. It's obvious that the heavily altered script was either slapped together, written on the fly, or at the very least not well thought out. The tone of the picture changes dramatically as it progresses (especially after its relatively assured beginning) but its not until we see Val Kilmer doing a Brando impression (certainly one of the most inexplicable scenes I've ever come across) that we realize no one seems to be in control of this incoherent mess. If this was just a schlocky b-movie there wouldn't be much to consider, but given the excellent cast, a capable director, and good makeup work, the occasional bits and pieces that register with the audience just make the film see that much more disjointed. For a big-budget action picture, ""Island of Dr. Moreau"" is a unique experience. It isn't as much bad as a mess, a cacophony of sights and sounds lacking a coherent narrative, and occupied by two egotistical stars too caught up making their own movie in their minds to bother with what's in the abysmal script. The one positive thing that I can say of ""Island of Dr. Moreau"" is that it does have value as a curio. It's almost fascinating to watch what happens when a film just plain goes bad, and makes you start to take for granted witless moronic fare that at least makes a bit of sense.",The Island of Dr. Moreau

Like the 1977 version this one does a woefully inadequate job of explaining what Dr Moreau thinks he is doing. Surgically changing animals into humans certainly needs some explaining. Why a Nobel Prize winner would waste his talent on such hare-brained nonsense needs explaining. This is the kind of sad thing Brando was doing towards the end of his career. This is well-mounted and the surgically offended ""animals"" truly and foolishly abused. Val Kilmer is very good in spite of having to perform the silly scene which ends in his death. Wells would, no doubt, find it amusing that after a life pretty much devoted to Fabian Socialist thought, he would be characterized as fascist. He did indeed think humans were, if not perfectible, they were at least improvable. I guess I should read the book and get his take on th Doctor's motivation.

The screenplay mercilessly exposes all the weaknesses in the source material, and the director's utter inability to make even one character sympathetic makes the film's Grand Guignol aspect rather tedious.The only plot development I could react to with even a flicker of mild interest was the escape scene at the end; I thought it was a pity that anyone escaped, as they were all so disagreeable. And then - the moralizing voice-over! Did they honestly think we didn't *GET IT*?????

The people who construct defenses of this film by referring to the message and admittedly interesting premise seem to forget that you don't need to watch this film to get either, since there are two other film versions and (whoa!) a classic novel as well. In other words, there's no reason whatsoever for this waste of celluloid to have been released on an unsuspecting public...or even for it to have been made in the first place.""OK, wise-guy--what's so bad about it, then?"" Everything except the costumes. This was Brando's return to the full-blown inmates-running-the-asylum lunacy of Apocalypse Now, except there's precious little talent involved (save Brando's own long-squandered acting chops) or anything resembling an artistic vision to guide the horrible mess. What we get instead is a morbidly fascinating ego pile-up fueled by drugs and chaos--and did I mention that it's ineptly edited as well? You could start a whole new drinking game based on the inexplicable lingering blank looks, awkward pauses, and perplexing continuity gaps. Every time something happens that makes no cinematic sense whatsoever, shout ""WTF?!?"" and down another shot. At least that way, you'll pass out halfway through the movie and spare yourself ""the horror"" of watching the rest.""OK, wise-guy--how about some examples?"" Fine. What's with Kilmer doing his freaky Brando impersonation when his character temporarily takes over the island? It would almost make sense except that it's Brando's Godfather character that he's doing(!). Why didn't anyone on-set have the cajones to tell Brando to quit f***ing around and take the g-ddam champagne bucket off of his head during the ""stupid hat"" scene? Why do the occasional chase scenes lack any suspense or excitement and just sort of end? Why do all the actors seem like they're completely blitzed on quaaludes and heroin? The inevitable impression one takes away from this movie is that no one was in charge, and the resulting film feels like watching a grown-up kindergarten populated by furry things who are all amped up on superhuman quantities of narcotics...and did I mention that the teacher's called in sick?

The writhing and squirming micro-organisms have you itching in your seat before the movie even starts. That said - This show has some very mediocre performances from some of the greatest actors.  Val Kilmer almost gives his icky character some appeal before vaulting into a demented drug trip, but Marlon Brando does nothing to redeem the evil Dr.  In fact, I'm hoping the whole time, the poor castaway - the only appealing fellow on screen - will jump back into the ocean from whence he came and the whole place sinks to the bottom of the sea.

95,fullam-david,Complete and utter garbage.,1,23 November 2016,"It's pointless to go into all that went on behind the scenes of this monumental turkey, superb articles and a truly excellent documentary (Lost Soul) have already done so. Suffice to say, had we gotten the original Richard Stanley film (the script is to be found online), we might have gotten a modern Science Fiction/Horror masterpiece along the lines of John Carpenter's The Thing. Instead we got one of the biggest film fiascos, perhaps, of all time. Marlon Brando looks (and acts) an utter fool as Moreau. So sad to see what was America's greatest actor as an overweight mime/clown, his glory days long gone. Val Kilmer is equally horrible in his role, on an incredible ego trip via the Batman film he was in, he gives a truly embarrassing performance that rightfully helped to derail his career. Fairuza Balk, at least, tries real hard. She was utterly disgusted at Stanley's firing and wanted desperately to quit the film. But contractually bound, she was forced to stay. She does well to hide the strain and give a good performance. But it's a shame she has to be associated with this. Other than that, it's the magnificent make up FX of the Stan Winston Studio that shines, and the beast men and women are very, very impressive.In the end, it gives misfire a new name and only further sullied the later, downward spiral, career of John Frankenheimer.

Frankenheimer was a master film maker and this one is no exception. Chock full of messages, metaphors and allegory on man's ignorance and arrogance, this film is very much worthwhile seeing. It remains one of my favorites after multiple viewing but it is not light fare or ""entertaining"" in the Hollywood sense. Brando and Kilmer are masterful. Cinematography and make up are superb.

97,tyrexden,Better than what you might have heard,7,16 September 2019,"I saw this theatrically as a kid, and then again as a full-blown adult. My reaction is pretty consistent where i felt it was decent entertainment. Thematically, i can't really argue with how they depicted any of the story or portayals, or action. its a funky story in the first place, and movie does a good job of inflecting some subtle humor here and there, some horror elsewhere (although you can't really say this movie is actually scary), and some off-the wall performances. While one could say Brando probably took this role only for a paycheck, he still creates a bona-fide character who is interesting and you can believe, even though the character is a weirdo. The makeup effects throughout the film are above-average, especially as it shows the animals progress, and while the CGI is spotty sometimes, the technology was only a few years old at that point, and its passably good enough. if this movie starts to fall apart a bit, its the sequences inside the villianeous tribe of animals, because here, its more about showing off the physical performances and some pyrotechnic explosions, and thus the whole thing has a different vibe and directorial style than the rest of the film. Its understandable, because these parts were probably filmed by a different person who specializes in these types of sequences. David Thewlis is great at being constantly and progressively fed up at the whole ordeal, and Val Kilmer brings a certain magneticsm as well. All in all, i'd recommend for a lazy Sunday viewing if you have nothing else going on., if for no other reason other than witnessing the Brando performance which has been references a lot in pop culture.",The Island of Dr. Moreau

101,hgni,Sense of humor needed to watch this,7,7 October 1999,"This movie gets a bad rap -- viewers say Brando plain sucks and that it butchers a good Wells story. Perhaps the latter is true, but I consider Brando, as the mad doctor, a fine choice and, while he is rather subdued, he is still the candid, self-conscious actor we all know and love. He practically mumbles his lines as his mouth is lined with cotton and (probably) cheeseburgers. And, the scene where Brando plays piano along with his ""pre Mini-Me"" sidekick is a classic. Now, I know Brando refused to learn his lines for this movie and Kilmer is known for being a real ass to work with, but the in-production feuds add to the aura of this film. These characters aren't supposed to like each other and the tension fills the air. The special effects are top notch, albeit gruesome and a bit overdone. It all adds to the feel of the movie. I have this movie on tape and watch it again and again, alongside ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,"" ""Taxi Driver,"" ""Rear Window"" and ""Dr. Strangelove.""

I feel it only fair now that I've seen it to convince you to ""use your time and go watch it!!!"" This is a thinking film. Much of the dialogue is well thought and convincing especially from the mouth of Marlon Brando (who is yet again another 'distasteful' character, though after reflection is merely a character with a different point of view on life).I really enjoyed the film.

Val Kilmer (in the middle of his divorce) looked like he wanted to kill everyone there and then himself, and Brando was the beyond creepy crazy weirdo that they wanted to be 1000 miles away from. It was so bizarre... the tone of the movie from the actors *in* it was just as unsettling as the story. I don't get why they couldn't just fire Kilmer if he was causing most of the trouble, but it seems like the studio made him stay or made the team ""work it out"" or both.I graduated from film school years ago and this nightmare of a production is one example why I'm not pursuing that career any longer.

I can't believe that Marlon Brando accepted a role in such a project. He was awarded a ""Golden Raspberry"" for his performance and he deserves it.

107,gabriel@arq.net,"Watch for Mini-Marlon, Buckethead, and Val's Brando!",5,21 January 2006,"I didn't know what to expect, as I sat down and started watching a VHS of this with some friends several minutes into the movie.At first I thought it was a movie about how a spoiled-rotten Englishman might learn a thing or two about life from a swarthy, island-hopping character played by Val Kilmer. The Englishman goes on about how cute a rabbit is, so Kilmer snaps its neck in his face, that sort of thing. That's right about where I started watching. For a few moments I thought Kilmer was going to preach about the desolation the seemingly innocent rabbit can bring to a beautiful island if its population goes unchecked, but then he broke its neck (and I never figured out why).Then I thought it was going to be a movie about teaching the spoiled Englishman how to loosen up and have a good time, when Kilmer allows him to discover the belly-dancing girl. A lot goes wrong; the Englishman exotifies the woman and alienates her at every step, and I kept thinking she was trying to seduce him to get close enough to smack him around or hurt him for being so inhuman in such a rottenly subtle way. Instead, she sees Kilmer watching from nearby and runs off. I thought Kilmer said something to the extent of bringing her some pudding upstairs, and my impression was that the Englishman was able to make himself comfortable with the thought of her as a toy, but still having no idea why he was on the island with Kilmer.Then the Englishman wakes up in some kind of jail, and running around discovers -- almost as if he was directed to -- a little zoo inside the mansion on the island. And then as he's walking around the little zoo, he discovers there are doctors taking a screaming, bloody, animatronic baby out of pregnant woman wearing a pigface out of Kubrick's ""The Shining"". Then he freaks out and runs around. The scene of him running or falling into a zoo happens again, later, and my impression was that the Englishman was receiving some sort of moral lesson for having not helped some small monkeys free another small monkey from a cage, on an island where obviously you're supposed to do something humane to balance out all of the things that make English people uncomfortable.Instead of learning to be less spoiled and learning to enjoy and share the company of the strange animal-people, the Englishman decides to always freak out and alienate and threaten everybody around him. When he gets his hands on a gun, it's really the pivotal point of the movie. At the perfect moment for the Englishman to say ""oh, I didn't know you were all buddy-buddies living under the careful watch of a fat man pretending to be the Empress of China,"" instead he waves the gun at all the animals and starts a power-imbalance that eventually unravels the island's entire social structure.Eventually there is a trial where a monster who particularly scared the Englshman is used as a scapegoat for the Englishman's crime of failing to help the boatload of little monkeys release their fellow little monkey from its cage. The Englishman's lawyer tries to defend him by stating that nobody is allowed to escape, but not until after he persecutes him by stating that nobody's supposed to act out violently. So, the scapegoat is given the opportunity to show how fierce of an animal he is towards the fat transvestite, who shoots him. The post-trial atmosphere is that the scapegoating has bought the alienating, rude, obnoxious Englishman some more time to live and think about what he's done, but that soon he's going to have to pay the price for his violence; that, or attempt to break the law of never escaping, and get killed in the process.Then something totally unexpected happens, one of the animal-people sniffs around the burned remains of the scapegoat and pulls a bone out and appears to be ready to eat a piece of charred flesh when instead he stabs his fingernails into his guts and pulls out some kind of little black box. Evidently this frees him from the island's mind-control network, and from then out the movie makes little sense.Despite not making sense, the movie has three great scenes later on: 1. the fat transvestite playing a baby-grand piano, with a small version of himself sitting on top of that piano and playing his own, smaller version of a grand piano. Then, there's a scene where the alienated girl pours stuff into an inverted bucket on the transvestite's head, and he scolds her for making it too strong. Then he convinces her that being like him isn't so great because his behaviour is so strange. The best scene in the whole movie is when Kilmer dresses up in enough clothing to cover his form and sits down dictating in the voice of Marlon Brando. He sounds just like Brando in ""Apocalypse Now"" when he was talking into his recorder in the jungle. Then he turns around and because his form is so hidden he looks like the little guy from the piano scene. So it came across like the little guy was pretending to be the transvestite in the transvestite's absence. It was so ridiculous that even the Englishman ran out of the scene screaming laughter.That's what the movie was about.",The Island of Dr. Moreau
108,hamlet65,Has Brando replaced June Allyson for Depends Undergarments?,1,28 December 1999,"This film is proof positive of what a mediocre actor Marlon Brando is.  This movie defies description.  It is like the Mardi Gras with Marlon camping it up in diapers, a mumu and kabuki make-up.  The scene where he plays the piano with one of his creatures is something out of John Waters.  My favorite scene is when he sits with a bucket on his head while his daughter fills it with ice.  I'm sure the director hope that the chill my startle a performance out of him.  Brando is an actor who has given a handful of extraordinary performances due in most part to the fine writing that he was given.  When one looks at his career it is loaded with bombs in which he sleepwalks through.  It is easy to see why he is so admired by the current generation of actor's his lazy, undisciplined and self-indulgent behavior is the same traits that many of them have adopted.  One must go back and look at Spencer Tracey, James Stewart and Barbara Stanwyck to see actors whose work was a craft whose professionalism and dedication is apparent in all the performances.

It's beautifully photographed for one thing and the tension on the set between the actors -- especially Val Kilmer and Brando adds to the tension of the film itself.

I'm not saying that the theme is all that deep nor that I am so smart to have discovered it. I'm just saying that I had a thought about it. Anyway, perhaps the theme is that we all have a little animal inside us (evolutionarily speaking) and why should we always try to repress it - as the animal/human hybrid had to do in this movie.

When Brando's character was killed, I was very upset (he was the only character I felt much interest in or sympathy for), and wondered how the rest of the movie could possibly hold up. But when the cat woman got killed, the idiomatic camel's back was broken. What followed was horrible maelstrom. Both my friend and I were very close to leaving early (which I have never voluntarily done), but we both stuck it out, in what in retrospect could only be described as pure masochistic fashion. Again, this was a very embarrassing film considering the talent involved. I traditionally love Brando and Kilmer; Balk was another wasted treasure.

Hyena finds the remains of a chip which is used to shock the animals. He begins to form alliances with other fellow mutants and wage's a battle against the doctor. There are many explosions in this film along with good plot twists. the film ends with Thewlis leaving the ill-fated island in a raft/dinghy recounting his thoughts of his involvement on the island.

Marlin Brando is unleashed here, and with absolute effortless extracts from his repertoire a delicious, eliding performance that dominates the film. However the transcendance of medium achieved here relies on David Thewlis and Val Kilmer as well. Each of main leads bring their own rich flavour of campiness. The happless Thewlis brings a turn of the century stilted formality to pay at least part homage to the original work, which is otherwise deservingly massacred. This arch patina of homoeroticism is in turn burnished up to a flashy sterile veneer by Val Kilmer's fleckless self prostitution. The dynamic between the two, compelling in itself, is both eclipsed and illuminated by the pure radiating light that is Brando. The three form a constellation of pulsing chaos that drives the film though its myriad of clichés punctuated with whatever viceral imagery stayed off the cutting room floor.

The actors/actresses do an amazing job with the terrible script, plot, motivations, and direction of the movie. Fairuza Balk does an amazing job and actually took me away from the terrible movie briefly with her great acting. I gave this 2/10 instead of a 1 because of the great acting by Fairuza Balk and David Thewlis.It's a shame because I think all the actors and actresses really wanted to work on the project because it was with Brando and it was the first major film for some of them. Unfortunately Brando's arrogance, terrible writing, terrible plot, bad directing all sink the movie.A few ways I think I would improve the film is this; use less camera shots, stick with just the shot of them in the car pulling up to the compound instead of showing the whole place in 5 different shots. I think for this movie, less shots would have helped keep the mystery and the creepy of the island. Besides that the writing needed a huge overhaul and the actors (not Brando) needed more of a say.",The Island of Dr. Moreau
121,stevenweitzner,Weird but entertaining,6,19 December 2020,A great cast in an average movie. This film is a weird one and the story kind of stalls in a few places. If you like Sci fi films this aint the best movie ever but it is worth the watch.,The Island of Dr. Moreau
122,ben149,Complete mess of a movie,2,22 June 2006,"I'm not being unfairly vindictive here in giving it a 2/10. Its just that this barely resembles a quality movie you'd associate the names Brando and Kilmer with. Prior to seeing it I was extremely excited on hearing the premise of the story, and learning that it was a remake of an old H.G. Wells novel I even went as far as to read the first 3 chapters of the book to psyche myself up.Bitter disappointment. The story of mad scientist creates half man half beast is the sort of fantasy I dreamed of as a kid, but in this movie it makes a mockery it. Voice acting is often dodgy, sometimes pretentious, costumes and physical acting seem primitive by today's standards, plot and pacing is all over the place. Surely the book couldn't have been this bad.I was particularly interested in this film because I've been doing some reading on Darwin and watched the excellent PBS documentary series on his life and legacy. I thought this would be the great 'next step' in evolution, something akin to Jurassic Park. Nope. Just a mess of a movie.",The Island of Dr. Moreau
123,lisapoppy1,weird,9,20 June 2001,"This was a good film but it was spoiled with the animals they were too fake but other than that it was good,val kilmer brightened it up with his insane charactar its a shame he died at the end though.it goes down hill at the end it just gets a bit tiring",The Island of Dr. Moreau
124,two_rings_one_heart,Both good and bad,3,19 September 2006,"The Island of Dr. Moreau has both good and bad points. The main strength of the movie is the scientific warning to our community that it provides: this could happen to you. Despite the strength of the gene manipulation, the characters are often supposed to be scary but come across more humorous than frightening. The plot has a few holes. Up until Aiessa asks for Edward's help, there is no real drive in the main character. He finds he cannot help her, but he's more concerned with what he finds his use was going to be: his DNA=a permanent stop to her regression. Then abruptly she is hung in a fight, and soon after he gets to leave. You see that he has bonded with the races upon the island at the end, but there is no lead in. It is disputable, in fact, because Edward says to Aiessa that if it weren't for her, he would say the Dr. failed in his goal completely. Now she's gone and he likes them? What is that? Now don't get the wrong idea, I definitely think it's a good movie to prove a point to scientists, but I don't think it has a strong plot line. Read the book.",The Island of Dr. Moreau
125,DKMovieguy,Over the top Brando and cool Winston FX make for fun time,7,29 April 2007,"Much has been said about Marlon Brando's signature roles (eg GODFATHER, LAST TANGO IN Paris, ON THE WATERFRONT, etc)but it's his lesser seen performances that truly enhance his stature. The guys is always watchable and never boring and his role in MOREAU is just one of many examples. Weighing in at close to 300 lbs. and covered in white kabuki style make-up Brando's role in this is borderline insane and pushes MOREAU well beyond being just another late '90's circa FX filled action pix into something that over time will be considered a real cinematic oddity. My favorite sequence is when he is playing a piano duet with the world's smallest man, something that probably inspired Michael Myers to create the character mini-me in the AUSTIN POWERS series.Cutting edge FX (for the time) by Stan Winston and brisk direction by John Frankenheimer, in one of his last outings overall position MOREAU as an enjoyable 100 minute plus ride for fantasy film fans and a must for Brando-philes.",The Island of Dr. Moreau
126,daler001,A wonder to behold through parted fingers,6,27 October 2008,"A fascinating train wreck of a movie. Everyone should see it and marvel at the shambles. There are very few studio flicks where you can actually see the cracks and seams of a film, and the seeming awareness of the actors that the movie is falling apart. You can't help but wonder by points what the hell Marlon Brando and Val Kilmer are doing, their behaviour seems so absurd. Either Frankenheimer lost control or just went along, I don't know. This is one of the those bad movies that is infinitely more interesting than an average one. There is a good chance Apocalypse Now could have turned out this way if Francis Ford Coppola hadn't kept it together, some of the difficulties and possibilities of disaster seem similar. Apocalypse Now skirted disaster, Moreau did not. I'd love to see an honest making-of film about this one.",The Island of Dr. Moreau
127,AnotherBoringLoser,"very, very interesting",9,27 January 2003,I must say that this new version is maybe only a half as good as the 1977 version. But I have to give it some credit because its so different. Its very messy and could have been directed better but I find it very interesting. Especially the character Azazello. He was intriging in a way and I enjoyed watching his character throughout the movie. Even though this movie wasn't the best it could have been and doesn't compare to the novel or the original movie I gave it a 9 because its the type of movie I could watch over and over again.,The Island of Dr. Moreau
128,jp404,A sorry spectacle,1,10 June 2005,"I was one of those privileged to see Brando on stage in ""A Streetcar Named Desire."" It was an experience not to be forgotten and impossible to describe -- a searing, blue-flame performance which could not be fully realized in the film version, fine as it was. And now it has come to this! In his first appearance he looks like Buddha in clown white improbably garbed in a nun's habit. The remainder of the performance is a passable imitation of Sidney Greenstreet in ""The Maltese Falcon"" having a chuckle at his own expense. For some reason Brando seems to be having a jolly time displaying his monstrous corpulence in this monstrous travesty of a film. The pity! the pity! the pity! Still there is that formidable presence. Like the proverbial train-wreck it is horrible to see but impossible to look away from. As for Kilmer and Thewlis, they were present. The virtuoso work of the make-up department should be noted as a plus. They did create some truly monstrous creatures.The film at times becomes almost incoherent due to some strange lapses in the stories continuity. For instance, for a time Kilmer seems to be the only rational person on the island (even though he wears a sarong left over from a Dorothy Lamour flick. And then without any sort of transition he is as mad as a march hare. If you care to see a number of significant talents crash and burn this is the film for you.",The Island of Dr. Moreau
129,cemrw,"Read the book, don't waste time with the film",3,21 July 2021,"I saw David Thewlis in the cast as starring role first. I ran to buy the book, read it in rush and absolutely loved it! The book was really good. Then I came back to watch the film. It was a great disappointment. I killed all my excitement and pleasure. To me the film was a freak show! I hope someone remakes it.The storyline is similar to the books however they changed the one crucial thing. From this point spoiler alert for both book and the film,In the book, Dr. Was trying to transform animals to humans. There were creepy scenes explained and creepy creatures. However in the film, Dr Moreau creates kind of hybrids.The hybrid idea is cames to my mind first when I was reading the book. The author gave some hints about the experiments of Moreau and I thought that it should be hybridization but it wasn't! And for me it was a great pleasure to find our it wasn't!Then they added the weird cat-woman, which was not from the book. I could have been written better that the cat woman was the only successful subject of the experiments but there were some meaningless drama there. They wasted the whole opportunity.",The Island of Dr. Moreau
130,kabanzafer,was a good start for me,6,8 September 2006,"This is the first movie I have ever watched in cinemas. It was ten years ago so far and as far as I remember I enjoyed watching the film. First of all the visual effects and the environment were so good that you cannot close your eyes one seconds. The ones who like the nature would like to see this movie I think. Make-up is a very important issue on cinema I think and I am mostly beware of this while watching movies. This film was good at make-ups really. The scenario was also nice at all, at least was not boring but as I said it was ten years ago and I don't remember too much. Marlon Brando in the cast is a plus for this movie. Anyway if you have chance someway watch this out.",The Island of Dr. Moreau
131,grahammayer,To go on two legs is very hard,9,3 September 2005,"I'm not sure if that is the exact quote from the movie, but I think altogether too many reviewers of this film go on four. I really enjoyed this move for its story, the acting and the way it conveyed its many messages. One guy even had the gall to describe it as a bad Jurassic Park. Now that was a bad movie. Great special effects for the time perhaps but a paper thin story that failed to explore its subject and the implications thereof. This movie makes no such mistake. It explores themes of what it means to be human, whether ends justify means, and what is moral or immoral from different perspectives. It even explores the nature of good and evil to some degree. There are far too few movies, especially these days, that have this kind of depth and leave you, ultimately, to be the judge. Yes, it is disturbing; its meant to be. Yes, it is dark; its meant to be. It makes you think and leaves and indelible impression. It certainly has its flaws but if you can see past them, then perhaps you go on two legs, even though its hard.",The Island of Dr. Moreau
132,joyhenry,Total Cult Classic,9,8 March 2021,I never understood why this movie got such bad reviews. It's always been one of my favs. The weirdness and eccentric acting is soooo spot on. You have to have kinda an off sense of humor to appreciate it though. It's just fantastic in every sense of the word....a happy accident.,The Island of Dr. Moreau
133,jarvis-83710,Train wreck,3,6 September 2020,"Some may have you believe that this film is unfairly judged and the Richard Stanley version would have been a triumph. Neither are true. This film was always destined to be a B-movie and the blame cannot be put on Brando, Kilmer or Frankenheimer solely. Even Thewlis puts in a cringe inducing performance, who can blame him with the campy source material he and everyone had to work with. This film is like a compilation of all the worst bits of the original Planet of the Apes movies.",The Island of Dr. Moreau
134,jamesb-5,"Unique, out of the mainstream, thought-provoking, great soundtrack",10,2 December 1998,"If you are bored with traditional romance or adventure or horror films and want something different, something powerful, this is it.  The title sequence is amazing (huge vivid images of microscope views of bacteria moving, eyeballs blinking, all flashing rapidly through a sequence).  The acting is powerful.  The story is very thought-provoking and, given the time when the original story was written, not too unrealistic. The soundtrack is great - mysterious, powerful, unique - again, something you'd like if you're bored with modern pop music or rock or tear-jerker romantic string orchestras.  But the film does get vividly violent and may be *too* powerful and emotionally disturbing for some.",The Island of Dr. Moreau
135,leika,Treat yourself to Brando being eaten...,1,8 December 2002,"You won't be surprised to learn that he offers a complete three course serving for a large number of actors, including doggie-bags to go. The beasts are dressed in discarded costumes from the musical Cats - here used to cover up mutated crosses between humans and animals.You also get to see Val Kilmer imitating Brando in Apocalypse Now; and Brando imitating Anthony Hopkins, including a session at the piano before the great Brando gets chewed up by his animal critics.Thewlis has no idea what he's doing in the movie, but that's OK, since he's fallen out of a plane and ended up on the island by chance.The director has no idea what he's doing WITH the movie - and that's not OK, though you wish he'd fallen out of the same plane, on the way to the shoot.It's kind of distressing to realize that the film was made by John Frankenheimer. Let's hope they had a lot of fun after each shoot day - though since a lot of the scenes are at night, they probably didn't, since nights were spent shooting. And days were spent regretting what they just shot.They shouldn't have bothered. If I ever get hold of another of H.G. Wells' invention, the Time Machine, I'll use it to go back to when this mess premiered in LA. The reactions from an astonished and perplexed industry, while watching this, must have been at least as rewarding as they were during Battlefield Earth.This is, truly, one of the worst films ever...",The Island of Dr. Moreau
136,floki,Good idea awfully screwed up!,3,10 June 2000,"The only good thing about this film is the work of Val Kilmer. The story is told much too quickly, which causes it to be unconvincing. The beasts that appear (we're told they are half man, half animal) all look like chewbacca the Wooki. After seeing the superfluous performance of Marlon Brando, I'm even more convinced than I was that he should have retired after he played Kurtz in ""Apocalypse Now"", who by the way he tried to be one more time. David Thewliss nagging makes me want to beat him up...if you agree with me, please go see ""Naked"", a film that really shows what he can do.",The Island of Dr. Moreau
137,comikozie,"Sub-par special effects and costumes, amazing plot and characters.",8,2 January 2001,"The costume design was patronizing and would have benifitted from 2000-era computer animation, but I thought the film was wonderful. I believe many would agree with me that this was a classic sci-fi sleeper hit. It was edgy, visually interesting, and it avoided tired cliches and much other standard movie fair. It was to the point and grabbing the entire way through. Many people didn't like this movie because it was too edgy, or it ""lacked a plot"". Many people called it garbage or a waste of time. But as all serious moviephiles know, you need to look deeper into the movies you watch. It's not just about being entertaining, it's about having an impact on the viewer. I highly reccomend this movie, simply because it's so different, so fresh, and so thought-provoking.",The Island of Dr. Moreau
138,rshute2005,If We Can See Stars We Can Hear Voices,10,23 November 2008,"Let me be the first one to admit I still don't understand this movie but I might add I enjoy it a lot none the same. It's frightening to say the least when we study what they teach us in University only to find that with all that might and power comes the inevitable mistakes. Somebody should be watching the Scientists closely it seems because we have come a long way from dynamite and steam engines... but just how far can we go before we end up where we began? There's the cycle of the seasons... it rains then it freezes then it thaws and then it goes away... and if you will how long before the rains come again and the sharks get us,but this is my tribute to The Island of Doctore Moreau and not a roast.I had seen this movie broadcast on TV many times but never had time to sit and watch some corny make-up artists version of Deerbeasts and Pigmen and the like until like all things it became available to me so I bought it and took it home. I must have been in the right frame of mind when I watched the whole thing or maybe it's just that well made a movie but I watched the whole thing without getting up for even an intermission.Moreau is a character created by a long dead authour of some remark whom wrote many books of far out fiction and social comment. This story as in the original must have been a little hard to comprehend in it's day and this movie although infused with late twentieth century technique and mastery is not a bad attempt at what I think is at best a difficulty concept for us all to grasp. There's the allegory of the whole thing like some thick books of old used to do... presenting a story if you will but all the while showing us all just how far wrong you can be with some things.And there's the joy of the whole thing... about escaping paradise and getting back to the five o'clock world but that would defeat the purpose of this review... which is too comment honestly about a movie and yet not ruin it for those that haven't seen it.. right? So i'll quote myself on this one and say... this is a movie you "" should "" have seen and as for the book keep reading.",The Island of Dr. Moreau

I can't believe I'm actually bothering to write anything here. It was just a ridiculously bad film. What were they thinking? Maybe I missed the point. Did they mean to say that Dr. Moreau was God? Was a religious metaphor film? Well it was still terrible. Just bad, bad, bad. No acting. No dialogue that was believable. Absurd in a bad way musical-style costumes and plot lines. I rank it up there with Congo and the Apes movies as to be avoided due to poor primates dressing up to slur other primates and have other primates watch and believe.

This is one mind boggling tour de force with the likes of fat Marlon Brando channeling Colonel Kurtz and the Godfather all rolled up in a giant freezer of ice cream complete with hairy half human animals. The creatures costumes are a scream and a half. Val Kilmer plays his role with such serious intentions it makes a hilarious foil to Marlon Brando's over the top performance. Marlon creates an evil deranged Dr. better than the other 2 versions. Anything with Marlon is worth watching. Based on the HG Wells novel, this version would make old HG turn flips of hilarity in his grave. You will find this film astonishing, frightening and hilarious. I'm still giggling over the creatures outfits/hairdos/makeup. Imbibe while watching this and I promise a good time for all.",The Island of Dr. Moreau
