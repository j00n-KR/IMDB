0,Leofwine_draca,A crushing disappointment,2,16 October 2015,"Dull, derivative and distinctly boring, BASIC INSTINCT 2 is one of the worst studio films I've sat through in the past couple of months. Fans of Paul Verhoeven's steamy original will find their patience truly tested with this routine, out-to-make-money-and-money-alone sequel in which almost everything goes wrong from the very beginning. Things kick off in an unintentionally hilarious fashion as writer Catherine Tramell (played by the only original star to return, Sharon Stone) and real-life premiership footballer Stan Collymore are having some fun in a speeding car until it crashes and the footballer drowns. Soon afterwards, Tramell goes to see some shrink who attempts to get inside her head, while all the while a serious of sadomasochistic murders are being played out around them. Yep, it's a retread of the first film's plot, but with none of the genuine 'whodunit' atmosphere that that film evoked. Here, even a monkey could figure out the blindingly obvious 'twist' that comes up in the final reel, exposing the identity of a killer in a plot revelation that's so clichéd that it's frankly unbelievable.For some reason this film was relocated to London, and despite a fair bit of location work, the city just doesn't gel with the story. I blame director Michael Caton-Jones, whose drab camera-work saps life from the surroundings. Truly, this guy is a pedestrian when it comes to direction and he saps the life from what was a poor script to begin with. In these situations, the actors have little chance of making an impact. A miscast David Morrissey is wooden and uncomfortable as the psychologist who gets out of his depth, but he's of Olivier quality when compared to a bloody awful Sharon Stone. Stone, looking to have had a ton of surgery since the first movie, frankly stinks. Her attempts at being sultry are laughable and it's no wonder why she's not seen on our screens anymore. She's lost it.The supporting cast fare no better, aside from the reliable David Thewlis, the only actor to come out of this with his dignity intact. Somehow, he manages to salvage his poor dialogue and become the film's most interesting character. There's actually a good cast in this film, with the likes of Hugh Dancy and Charlotte Rampling popping up in minor roles, but you wouldn't know it as they're all mired down in sub-par scriptwriting and unbelievable dialogue that sounds trite. The death scenes are uninteresting and the mind game and cat and mouse stuff between the two leads is just boring. The overlong running time means that this is a real chore to sit through – a definite shame, as I thought the first film wasn't half bad.",Basic Instinct 2
1,SnoopyStyle,Not as bad as I hoped but still bad,4,26 July 2014,"Murder writer Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone) is living in London. After crashing her car, football star Kevin Franks in the passenger seat is killed. The police finds various drugs in his system and detective Roy Washburn (David Thewlis) is bent on locking her up. Police psychologist Dr. Michael Glass (David Morrissey) interviews her. Adam Towers (Hugh Dancy) is dating his ex-wife Denise Glass (Indira Varma) and wants to write about Tramell. Adam is also threatening to write about a former patient of Glass who killed his pregnant girlfriend. Milena Gardosh (Charlotte Rampling) is Glass's colleague. Glass diagnose Tramell as being addicted to risk, but she is released after a key witness is found to be unreliable.It opens up pretty well. There are great actors around. The police investigation holds good possibilities. Sharon Sone and David Morrissey just don't have enough intensity. His character is too lifeless. I would prefer the movie stay locked with David Thewlis keeping the same dynamics as the original. A police investigation is much more exciting. All the sitting around and talking isn't that compelling. At least the original had Stone crossing her legs and had more fun with the material. This doesn't work as a mystery or as a thriller or anything else. It ends with a very annoying sequence where it becomes really stupid what Glass does.",Basic Instinct 2
2,claudio_carvalho,Unbelievable and Absurd Plot,3,20 November 2006,"In London, while using drugs and having sex in a speeding car with a famous soccer player, the blond writer Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone) drives off the road, falls in the river and the athlete drowns. Dr. Michael Glass (David Morrissey) is assigned for a forensic evaluation, and in spite of being against bail, Catherine is released. Later Catherine goes to Dr. Michael's office and initiates therapy with him, and he sees that she is an omnipotent manipulative woman. However, as far as Dr. Michael knows her deeper and deeper, he becomes obsessed for her, while people of their relationship are killed.I do not know what the writers and director of this flick think about their target audience, but probably they believe they are at least imbeciles. The plot of ""Basic Instinct 2"" is so unbelievable and absurd that I dare to say that it is disrespectful with the audiences. The bureaucratic direction seems to be one of these ""canned"" movies broadcast on television and the neo-noir style never works. Sharon Stone's hairstyle does not fit well to her face, but she still is a very pretty and sexy woman and is the best in this lame movie. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): ""Instinto Selvagem 2"" (""Savage Instinct 2"")",Basic Instinct 2
3,jboothmillard,Basic Instinct 2: Risk Addiction,2,31 May 2009,"From Razzie nominated director Michael Caton-Jones (This Boy's Life, Rob Roy), this erotic crime thriller sequel is nicknamed ""Basically, It Stinks, Too"", and I can definitely agree. Basically crime novelist Catherine Tramell (Razzie winning Sharon Stone), now living in London, England, is in trouble again after her football player boyfriend Kevin Franks (footballer Stan Collymore) drowned in a car crash while she survived, and he was apparently already dead from a drug overdose. Police psychoanalyst Michael Glass (Cape Wrath's David Morrissey) is assigned to examine Tramell, who is obviously trying to seduce and manipulate him, while his friend Det. Roy Washburn (Harry Potter's Razzie nominated David Thewlis) is sure she is guilty. Tramell asks Michael to treat her for ""risk addiction"", and with each therapy session he is suspicious of her intentions. More and more murders are being committed, including Michael's ex-wife, Michael is now obsessed with proving Tramell's guilt with no real evidence to convict her. Also starring The Duchess's Charlotte Rampling as Milena Gardosh and King Arthur's Hugh Dancy as Adam Towers. This sequel may have been long- awaited, and Stone may have returned to her most famous role with one or two good icy lines and sexy scenes, but with no sign (or explanation) of Michael Douglas and a rubbish story this is a complete waste of time. It won the Razzies for Worst Picture, Worst Prequel or Sequel and Worst Screenplay, and it was nominated Worst Screen Couple for Stone's lop-sided breasts. Pretty poor!",Basic Instinct 2
4,Tweekums,Basic Instinct moves to London,6,1 June 2009,"I'd heard good things about this... from a reviewer who admitted that he only knew three people who liked it and that included himself and his wife. Given this review I had to check it out when it was on television.The film didn't seem to be particularly related to the first, largely because instead of being set in San Francisco it is in London; if it weren't for the presence of Sharon Stone it would have been a B grade British film that few outside Britain would have heard of. That said it wasn't terrible by any means; David Morrissey was good as the psychologist Michael Glass who was originally employed by the CPS to determine whether or not Catherine Tramell (Stone) should be bailed after an car crash in which a footballer died and it was alleged that she had deliberately killed him. Despite Glass's recommendation bail is granted and Trammel turns up at his office in the somewhat phallic Gherkin building asking to become a client. After some initial reluctance he accepts and things start going badly for him as people around him start getting murdered causing him to become a suspect.The plot is fairly convoluted with the chief suspect changing more than once. For an erotic thriller it isn't all that erotic, there are a few sex scenes but these are shot so as not to show more than the occasional glimpse of a breast or backside so anybody hoping to see as much as the first film showed will be disappointed. Overall it was a reasonable film that I suspect would have got better reviews if it hadn't been called ""Basic Instinct"", of course if it hadn't hardly anybody would have seen it.",Basic Instinct 2
5,BA_Harrison,Sorely needed Verhoeven's touch.,3,1 October 2012,"I've never been averse to the idea of a Basic Instinct sequel, even after all of these years—Sharon Stone has kept herself looking pretty damn good, after all; however, without the involvement of Joe Eszterhas and Paul Verhoeven, any follow up to the controversial 1992 erotic thriller was almost certain to fail.Director Michael Caton-Jones certainly isn't up to the task, lacking the perverse sense of humour and sheer outrageousness necessary to wring any fun from Leora Barish and Henry Bean's rather preposterous script. Where Basic Instinct opened with a bang (literally), part 2 starts with a whimper, not once comes close to matching the original in terms of tension, eroticism, excitement, violence or style, and ends with a dumb twist that makes very little sense.",Basic Instinct 2
6,wes-connors,Sharon Turns 2 Stone,4,13 August 2010,"""She captivated moviegoers with her raw sensuality and steel heart. Now Sharon Stone is back as the notorious crime novelist Catherine Tramell. This time she proves to be respected criminal psychologist Dr. Michael Glass (David Morrissey)'s deadliest challenge. With professional boundaries blurred by obsession, Dr. Glass is lured into a murderous web of lies and deceit and begins a torrid affair with Tramell that takes him to the point of no return. As their passions rise, so does the body count - and Dr. Glass faces a choice that will change his life forever,"" according to the DVD sleeve description.This belated follow-up to ""Basic Instinct"" (1992) has Ms. Stone's original novelist character going after Mr. Glass' psychiatrist character like she went after Michael Douglas' ""Shooter"" cop in the original, or does she The picture wants to re-open the question about who is killing off the cast. If there is some conclusive answer to that question, it passed me by. After the film reaches mid-point, you begin not to care, anyway. Stone looks like she may be positioning herself to go under the knife one too many times; she looks sexier and more natural in a ""special features"" interview. Others simply fill space.**** Basic Instinct 2 (3/21/06) Michael Caton-Jones ~ David Morrissey, Sharon Stone, David Thewlis, Charlotte Rampling",Basic Instinct 2
7,michaelRokeefe,Does crime novelist foretell the future?,8,20 July 2006,"Beautiful, leggy and sex personifide...crime novelist Catherine Tramell(Sharon Stone)writes about sex and murder. Once again she is on the wrong side of the law. Last time she was in San Francisco...this time London, where she is thought to be responsible for the death of a popular sports figure. Well respected psychiatrist Dr. Michael Glass(David Morrissey)is assigned by Scotland Yard to profile and evaluate Tramell for trial. She eventually lures him into her own mind game 'out shrinking' the shrink and manipulates him into confusion about her guilt or innocence as the body count rises. And his desire for her becomes an obsession.So many people have panned this sequel of the 1992 BASIC INSTINCT co-starring Michael Douglas. Strong sexuality and language, violence and nudity...I loved it. Stone is still HOT! I thought Charlotte Rampling was classy as Dr. Milena Gardosh.

8,sunwarrior13,What A Disastrous Sequel,3,22 October 2011,"The sequel of Basic Instinct has been in development for a decade since 1992.Sharon Stone,the lead star of the film,has stated that this would be her last sensual and sexy film.There were even litigation from the lead star and the studio to get this movie done as she started her preparations for reprising her role as Catherine Tramell like working out and following a healthy diet.Too bad that this film should have not been done despite from the pressure of Ms Stone's camp as Basic Instinct 2 turned into a disastrous sequel.Basic Instinct 2, also known as Basic Instinct 2: Risk Addiction, is a thriller film and the sequel to 1992's Basic Instinct.It stars Sharon Stone, who reprises her role of Catherine Tramell from the original, as well as David Morrissey, David Thewlis and Charlotte Rampling The film was directed by Michael Caton-Jones and produced by Mario Kassar, Joel B. Michaels, and Andrew G. Vajna. The film follows novelist and suspected serial killer Catherine Tramell, who is once again in trouble with the authorities. Scotland Yard appoints psychiatrist Dr. Michael Glass,played by David Morrissey, to evaluate her after a man in Tramell's presence dies. As with Detective Nick Curran in the first film, Glass becomes a victim of Tramell's seductive games.When the mysterious death of a major athlete prompts Scotland Yard detective Roy Washburn (David Thewlis) to order the investigation of best-selling crime novelist Catherine Tramell,criminal psychiatrist Dr. Michael Glass is slowly drawn into Tramell's seductive world of lies and sexual intrigue. Upon relocating from San Francisco to London, alluring crime novelist Tramell once again finds herself pursued by authorities when all clues point to her being somehow involved in the death of a popular sports superstar. Intellectually intrigued by his new subject and undeniably drawn to her physically, Dr. Glass finds it increasingly difficult to resist the cunning black widow's devious web of deception and physical temptation. When the professional boundaries between Glass and Trammel come shattering down in a shower of unbridled lust, Dr. Glass is forced to make a difficult decision that could mean the end of both his professional career, and his life.The movie was a disaster in the sense that it was unable to match the suspense,tension and sexuality of the first film.The screenplay was by Leora Barish and Henry Bean was unable to match that of Joe Eszterhas. Also,the performances were lacking even that from Sharon Stone,who was less interesting in this film.Aside from that,the film follows a confusing story that has somewhat turned from implausible which is highlighted by a ludicrous ending.Also missing is this film are memorable sex scenes and lines such as ""What do you do,charge me with smoking?"". In the end,this has disaster written all over it.It would have been better it it was never made at all.",Basic Instinct 2
9,preppy-3,Not bad at all,7,25 June 2007,"This picks up about a year after the events in ""Basic Instinct"". Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone) is now in London. While having sex with a soccer player while speeding about in a car going at 110 miles/hour (don't ask) she goes off the road and ends up in the Thames. She survives--he doesn't. The police hire psychiatrist Michael Glass (David Morrissey) to see if she's mentally competent to stand trial. Naturally she starts playing with his mind instead and plenty of murders and sex follow.This movie was doomed before it even opened. It took forever to get a cast and director, script problems were constant and the cast was not happy (Morrissey complained about the movie often). Still it's not too bad. It's a lot like the first--there's a lush music score, beautiful locations, plenty of sex and nudity (this had to be edited for an R), a nicely convoluted plot and good acting--but there's no impact. It feels like a retread of the first. People are being killed here with a choker leash (I believe)...just like people were being killed by an ice pick in the first. In one cute moment Stone picks up an ice pick and looks at it longingly. She's also playing mind games with a man and might be getting him implicated in murders. The similarities are too apparent.This is also VERY R rated--there's plenty of explicit sex talk, male nudity (Morrissey looks a lot better nude than Michael Douglas), female nudity (Stone still looks great) and some bloody murders. The acting is good across the board. Stone is just fantastic here; Morrissey looks miserable but is OK; Charlotte Rampling and David Thewlis are good in supporting roles.So--this isn't at all bad but feels like a remake of the first. Still I recommend it. People just attacked this because Stone is not well liked and they thought it was stupid to do a sequel to ""Basic..."" 14 years after it was made.",Basic Instinct 2
10,neil-476,Poor,4,24 April 2011,"Basic Instinct was trashy. But it was slick, glossy, well constructed, well acted, and it made sense.Basic Instinct 2 is trashy. It is also dull, slow at times, appallingly badly constructed, badly acted, has no believable chemistry between the principals, and makes very little sense.Moving Catherine Trammel's adventures to London is understandable but works against the film - it completely negates any possibility of glossiness which might have slightly rescued the film.Sharon Stone is required to look sinister and laugh at inopportune moments (like underwater in a jacuzzi as she is being strangled). She isn't very good.David Morrissey is worse. Not only does he have zero chemistry with Stone, he has zero charisma. And the script requires him to act with a complete absence of believability.This film is not very good.",Basic Instinct 2
11,gridoon2021,Surprisingly dull sequel,4,19 April 2015,"The 1992 ""Basic Instinct"" is a landmark in the erotic-thriller genre, and a film with great replay value. I have watched it about five times over the years, but I had never bothered with this belated - and critically / commercially lambasted - sequel until today. Maybe I should have kept away longer. This movie manages to be the one thing you least associated with the first ""Basic Instinct"": dull. The ""is-she-or-isn't-she-a-killer?"" question, which was a big part of the original's appeal, has been answered, so the plot this time is predictable. Aside from a shockingly bold sex scene with Flora Montgomery and a bloody throat slashing, it's pretty tame, talky stuff. The dialogue tries to be saucy, but it's mostly forced; there are no lines here that can match ""What are you gonna do, charge me for smoking?"". There is little heat generated between the miscast as a stud David Morrissey and the too old for the part (though still well preserved) Sharon Stone. Liberal use of Jerry Goldmith's now-iconic music score only serves as a reminder of a far superior film. Even the cinematography lacks the sheen of the original. *1/2 out of 4.",Basic Instinct 2
12,anaconda-40658,Basically It Stinks Twice As Much.,2,25 May 2015,"Basic Instinct 2 (2006): Dir: Michael Caton-Jones / Cast: Sharon Stone, David Morrissey, David Thewlis, Charlotte Rampling, Hugh Dancy: Manipulative and morbid thriller that does pretty much what the original film did and that is mess with one's mind and hormones. It also tells the same bloody story. Sex and murder mystery writer Catherine Tramell is suspected of murder again and David Morrissey plays a police psychiatrist whom is sucked into her mind screw. People die horrible deaths while Tramell is suspected yet not witnessed. The ending is an bigger kick in the ass than the original. Directed by Michael Caton-Jones who previously made another trash film that bares certain similarities in The Jackal. Morrissey is basically reciting Michael Douglas only he seems to get screwed over worse. Sharon Stone as Tramell can still turn on the heat but to a far lesser degree here. She is running the same drill manipulating while sitting pretty when fingers are pointed in her direction. David Thewlis plays an interrogation officer who originally arrests Tramell only to be killed in the overly stupid climax. Charlotte Rampling is unfortunately flat as someone set to take Morrissey off the case. While the original film has its supporters, its twist ending leaves much to be desired. With that said, it is still ahead of the sequel in creativity. This all winds down to a ninety minute mind rape. Score: 2 / 10",Basic Instinct 2
13,AaronCapenBanner,Catherine Returns.,4,26 September 2013,"Sharon Stone returns in her signature role as novelist Catherine Tramell, who is now living in London, and becomes the center of attention after being in a car with her football player boyfriend when it crashes into the river, drowning him. Police discover that he died of a drug overdose first, so Catherine is arrested and ordered to undergo therapy with Dr. Michael Glass(David Morrissey) who, like Nick Curran before him, is seduced by her brazen sexuality, and begins a torrid affair, despite warnings from his detective friend Roy Washburn(David Thewlis) and more murders piling up. Is Catherine guilty? Belated sequel, now directed by Michael Caton Jones, has Sharon Stone returning most convincingly as super-sexy Catherine Tramell, but otherwise this mystery is cold and unsatisfying, though not as dreadful as its reputation would lead you to believe. Still not as memorable as the first, which may be its biggest problem(along with the unexplained absence of Michael Douglas as Nick Curran).",Basic Instinct 2
14,FlashCallahan,Phallic cigarette lighters....,7,27 May 2012,"Catherine Tramell is living in London, and becomes the centre of police investigation when her boyfriend drowns in a car accident and it is revealed that he was already dead because of a drug overdose.Police psychoanalyst Michael Glass is called to examine Tramell, and is intrigued by the seductive and manipulative woman.On the other hand, his friend Roy Washburn is sure Tramell is guilty.Tramell asks Glass to treat her for her 'risk addiction' problem, and with each therapy session, Glass gets more and more suspicious about her intentions.As more and more murders are committed, including that of Glass's ex-wife, Glass becomes obsessed with proving Tramell's guilt even though the evidence is contradictory......So what if the film is fifteen years too late? The first one was just for dirty old men who sit at the back of the cinema, it just had a little more kudos because of Douglas, and a certain leg crossing scene.I for one enjoyed seeing Stone again on the big screen in the role that gave her fame, and the fact that it features scene chewer Thewlis, and the city of London endears me more.Morrisey is fantastic as the troubled doctor, and even Good old Stan Collymore is in it right at the beginning.The story and narrative are strange though, she destroys his life so she can write a book basically, but it seems a lot more confusing than that.Caton-Jones makes good use of all the Phallic based buildings in London, and uses the locale to great effect. Even if the film is a little on the shlocky side, it looks amazing and very slick.It's a fun little movie, never boring, and it's the best Stone has been in years. She's loving every minute of her screen time, and you know what? So did I.",Basic Instinct 2
15,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Basic Instinct 2,6,8 July 2006,"I was still under-aged when the original Basic Instinct made its debut in the local theater's under the relatively new R rating system, but suffice to say many already know of the kinky scenes, especially the infamous crossing and uncrossing of legs sans panties which sealed Sharon Stone's status as a Hollywood femme fatale.It's been 14 years since, and the sequel is just released here. Which makes one wonder why, given the question would anyone still be interested to see an aging body doing her thing again? It's no wonder that the preview crowd was mainly elderly uncles and aunties, who apparently had a good time dissecting whatever plot there is to this movie, and of the occupational hazards of being a mental doctor if your mental strength is found wanting.Not that it's not entertaining (I think my week of work work and more work made me easy to please), but elements which were associated with the original psycho sex thriller, save for Sharon Stone's returning novelist cum serial killer Catherine Tramell, are gapingly pissing. Gone is the icepick, and the graphic violence and killing. In place is a series of murder scenes which happen almost after the deed. The sex scenes here are so reduced, they're negligible, if compared to the original.And perhaps to balance the lack of sex, this movie migrates to a more mind-numbing psycho-babble flick, since the mind is the greatest sex organ, as Stone's character Tramell, mind-tangos London psychiatrist Dr. Michael Glass (David Morrissey), and detective Roy Washburn (David Thewlis), investigating her for an apparent murder-suicide of famed footballer Kevin Franks, in a cameo played by Stan Collymore, yes, THAT Stan Collymore. All he had to do in his movie debut was to act stone (pun intended) and finger Tramell. How hard is that?In dialogues filled with double entrées and sexual innuendos, Tramell basically waltzes through England in her see throughs, having fun running rings around the two male leads, in a carefully crafted game of cat and mouse with Glass. In her psychosis sessions with Glass on her ""risk addiction"", there was mention of Nick Curran (played by Michael Douglas in the first movie), but that was just about the link to the original. Basically as the movie wore on, bodies associated with Glass turned out murdered, and naturally Tramell, Glass and even the detective Washburn all become plausible suspects.Being the master manipulator, the audience might even be seduced by her ideas on the plausibility of certain events, and this swung the narrative into varying directions if you'd allow it. If you do, you'll probably give the possibilities the nod, despite some plot holes and an ending tense sense bordering close to absurdity.What's the motivation for the sequel? One wonders if it's just to revitalize Stone's flagging career by putting her back in one of her more iconic villain roles in cinematic history. Then again, she should have gone back to basics and not stain the original with a relatively lacklustre sequel.",Basic Instinct 2
16,christopher-underwood,sexy thriller with Stone on top form,7,31 May 2009,"Wow, don't folks have a downer on this film? For those like me who loved the original, saw it, not as a great film classic, but as a good solid, sexy thriller. This is very similar, it is a little more in your face perhaps and some are clearly put off by some of the more explicit moments and strangely, by the heady mix of sex and violence. But I thought the title alone would prepare most for what can be expected. With today's sensitivities, it would probably have been safer not to aim this at a mainstream audience. Clearly the US popcorn crowd are not up for the leading lady to stick her fingers up herself within the opening seconds, particularly whilst driving a car at speed. However for everyone else, this is a very decent sexy thriller with Stone on top form. The only problem for me is Stan Collymore. With the accusations and rumours of his violence against women, he must have seemed a great choice for the reluctant man of dominance here. Unfortunately, however charismatic a footballer he might have been, he looks drab and very ordinary opposite the sparkling seductress. Still worth a watch though and it is a rotten shame that because of this financial flop we are unlikely to see much more of the very fine, Sharon Stone.",Basic Instinct 2
17,Smells_Like_Cheese,It really wasn't all that bad as long as you're not expecting the first movie's excellence,6,13 December 2006,"Despite some pretty poor reviews of Basic Instinct 2, I figured that since I loved the first Basic Instinct, to give the second one a chance. I love Sharon Stone and she was so beautiful and dangerous in the first movie, why not give the sequel a chance? While it felt just like the first plot did, I thought it was actually over all a good mind f word thriller. I thought the acting wasn't too bad and the story worked, although I have to admit the psychiatrist screaming at the end was a little over the top, but it was a fun movie to watch.Catherine is back and while her and an athlete are in a car getting stoned and having sex, they crash and Catherine gets out in time, but the athlete does not. Catherine is under investigation for murder of the athlete, but since there is not enough evidence for the investigation, so she goes to a psychiatrist, Dr. Glass. But soon he finds himself being seduced into Catherine's world of sex, drugs, and murder, and he's starting to like it! Basic Instinct 2 is a pretty good thriller and I think people were expecting too much, or at least what the first Basic Instinct was, but believe me, on it's own, the sequel is a fair story that deserves a little more praise. Come on, I know IMDb users have seen a lot worse, and it's Sharon Stone! How could you hate Sharon? That excludes Catwoman, but still! 6/10",Basic Instinct 2

With Franks not surviving Catherine is charged with his death in both her wild driving and getting Frank's so doped up that he couldn't swim to safety!It's when court appointed psychiatrist Michael Glass, David Morrissey, was given the job to examine Catherine's mental condition that she started to manipulate him into thinking that he was responsible for all the killings that was to take place in the movie by the time it ended. It was in fact Glass' handling of a previous case that of convicted psycho killer George Cheslav that really started him going bananas. Telling the court that Cheslav was completely normal he was released on Glass' recommendation and later murdered his girlfriend by bashing her skull in with a brick! Now with the news that Cheslav had committed suicide behind bars tabloid magazine editor Adam Towers, Hugh Dancy, is about to publish the story that Glass knew all along that Cheslav was a danger to society! And where did Towers get that information from?

Alas, unintentional comedy was not what I was treated to, rather just one long, boring, seemingly never ending piece of pointless, cheap, exploitative, tacky artless crap. Quite possibly THE worst film of 2006, which also has to contend with some truly abysmal acting (including a cameo by controversial soccer ace Stan Collymore), a boring, meandering plot/script with no sense whatsoever of narrative structure or pace and even, God help it, some crap sex which fails to stimulate or arouse in any way. Ba-suck In-stinkt 2, indeed. Truly dire. NO STARS",Basic Instinct 2
22,dromasca,may the defense have a word?,7,9 September 2006,"Honorable jury, I would like to say a few words in defense of this movie. I believe that it has been trashed beyond limits, and it's not such a bad movie as the low IMDb average seems to indicate.If you try to look beyond the genre, and you make abstraction of all the history around the first movie, what we have here is a well written murder drama, set in a dark, yet slightly futuristic London, involving a presumed serial killer and sexual predator and a psychologist who will fall gradually under her spell. Or is it so? Around the two main characters played by Sharon Stone and David Morrissey gravitate a few other characters related to the story - the police inspector (David Thewlis), the fellow more aged psychologist (Charlotte Rampling), the ex of the psychologist (Indira Varma). All give good performances, by the way.The story has several twists, the guilt seems to pass from one to the other of the main characters gradually, and we are never exactly sure of what is truth and what is appearances in the story line. Sex does plays a role, but it's within the story and despite being quite explicit it's never in bad taste. Sharon Stone would not have gotten this role without her sex-appeal, but this film would not have existed without Sharon Stone. In my opinion it's by no means the abysmal movie many people seem to think it was.",Basic Instinct 2
23,MLDinTN,how did this sequel ever get made,2,18 June 2007,"This movie was awful compared to the first film. First the story was not thrilling, it did not keep you on edge like the first film. Also the sex scenes are very tame for today's standard. And it is no where near as hot as the first film.Sharon Stone does not even look like Sharon Stone any more. I don't know what she did to her face, but it didn't work. And I didn't think she played her character very well. Katherine in this film was too over the top and silly. The script just didn't work.FINAL VERDICT: Not good. This isn't a sexy thriller, but a boring wann-a-be mystery. Do not waste your time watching this.",Basic Instinct 2
24,CuriosityKilledShawn,"A rehash, but an entertaining rehash",7,31 March 2006,"A sequel that comes traipsing in 14 years after the original can be accused of cashing-in. But you shouldn't judge a film until you've seen it right? Yes, I know I am being a total hypocrite here. And if Basic Instinct 2 were to be accepted as a potentially good movie then perhaps they should have done it back in the late 90s when David Cronenberg was involved. Think of the movie he would have made!But, Hollywood being that grinding, pounding machine that it is, postponed this film until 2006. Verhoeven, Cronenberg, Jan De Bont and even John McTiernan all came and went. Lead actors such as Michael Douglas, Benjamin Bratt, Kurt Russell, Robert Downey Jr and Pierce Brosnan all passed.As the years passed, the film shifted from America to London and underdog director Michael Caton-Jones took charge. The lead went to David Morrissey, who I have never heard of and a supporting cast of recognisable British faces filled out the rest of the characters. But after all this...is all this teasing and sexual depravity still relevant?A lot has changed in 14 years. We no longer need to walk away from newsagents ashamed for buying a jizz mag because so much better stuff is easy available for free on the internet. And I know where to find the best stuff! Softcore porn is almost extinct and TV has become racier and more hedonistic. A film selling itself on sex would have to be more than just competent in the story and character department.If this is what matters to you I am afraid that Basic Instinct 2 is pretty much the exact same as the original with the same character arcs and developments. The new location and a fresh crop of characters to kill is really all it's got to offer.This time around Catherine Tramell is causing havoc in the streets of London and 'accidently' causes the death of a famous football star by driving her car into the Thames. She's not sorry and shows no sympathy. Sent for a psych evaluation she meets Dr. Michael Glass who convinces the judge she has a 'risk addiction' and will not stop pushing the limits to her madness until it costs her her own life.Glass must be a convincing man as Tramell is soon scot-free to do more evil deeds. And Glass, despite being as reserved and collected as a man can possibly be, like Nick Curran before him, falls head first into a wildly complex plot that bears more than just a shadow of a resemblance to the first. But this time we go a little bit deeper into the devious mind of Catherine Tramell. As a writer myself (simultaneously really crap and unbelievably brilliant) I really dig her style. She lies and deceives and manipulates people in diabolically genius ways for her own inspiration. She hides it from everyone but when you look in her eyes you can see the fire of a brilliantly evil mind blazing away. She's a great character and Stone pulls it off perfectly. She may be pushing 50 but she's still gorgeous and in my opinion she looks better in this than she did in the first.What Basic Instinct 2 lacks is a defining set-piece or action scene. It's most all talk and has none of the car chases or panic the original had. Michael Caton-Jones, who's career in film has been extremely unbalanced brings a slick edge to movie and makes it a bit darker than Verhoeven's approach. The world of Basic Instinct 2 is set in a London filled with shining glass and steel surfaces by day and dark shadows by night. Jerry Goldsmith was set to score the film but due to his untimely death the duties were passed onto John Murphy. But worry not, all of Goldsmith's wonderful themes return and although Murphy tries to make it his own by adding his own developments, almost every cue still belongs to Jerry. It's a great score and one of those that stays in your head forever. It's easy to criticize Basic Instinct 2. It's easy to call it loads of names. But the first film suffered from this exact same problem, but the audiences of today are just far more savage and unforgiving. See past these problems and, like before, you'll discover a film that the rest of the world seems to be missing.",Basic Instinct 2
25,tabuno,One of the Best Dislikable Movies,8,22 January 2019,"24 July 2006. It's really hard not to hate this movie but at its core, its actually quite good technically. The convoluted plot and the twists and turns, the set up and the mystery are all solid. By the ending, it's the real deal. Yet, with the female you love to hate, it's still almost impossible to dislike this movie. The sex isn't over the top. The action isn't there, but the psychological thrill is. This is the mystery thriller as it was meant to be as the gyrating who done it becomes almost impossible to pin down. Except for the complexity that's a tad too overwhelming, an unconvincing turn of events (dealing with one of the major twists) towards the end, and perhaps to just too nice gentle landing (or not), Sharon Stone wins hands down for her performance and script. Yet, it's still one of the most detestable movies to watch at the same time. How's that for a real test of a movie? Eight out of Ten Stars.",Basic Instinct 2
26,johnnyboyz,Seduction by the numbers in this uninteresting and flawed 'thriller'.,4,17 March 2008,"Any trace that the first Basic Instinct film still lingers in the filmmakers memory is short and sharp in Basic Instinct 2 with the references consisting of Tramell (Stone) standing next to a block of ice and stabbing it with a pick. But it is not just the visual references that are sparse, it is the look and feel of the original that also lacks here, in a rather disappointing and woeful 'whodunit' film aimed at an audience that is old enough to be able to watch sex and violence but stupid enough not to notice a daft narrative and silly script.The things I'm referring to when I say the certain charm of the first one is lacking mainly consists of the atmosphere. I wrote about the first one that it felt eerily like a horror film of sorts with short, sharp bursts of music firing up at certain points and what with the brutal murder happening in the opening scene complete with accompanying music, it went a long way in setting up an eerie presence and ominous atmosphere. Here, the first scene also goes a long way in setting up atmosphere and tone  for all the wrong reasons. Tramell and a footballer (played by Stan Collymore, no less!) speed along in a CGI car at 110 mph in an urban, built up area. They go through tunnels, through streets and crash over bridges before ending up in a river  the look on Collymore's face as he comes to terms with his predicament, the sexual activity that leads up to the crash and the generally odd looking environment the two are driving around in do more wrong than right.So with what we think is the initial incident set up, it is the turn of the British police to interrogate Tramell as to what happened, echoing the events of the first film when she is collected for the interrogation but there is no cop sneaking a glance at her as she dresses for the occasion, nor is there any incidental cross-legging in the police station  what a shame some might say after all, that is one of the more memorable moments from the first film. But Basic Instinct 2 does not have any particularly memorable moments at all. So, what do we learn of Tramell when she is being spoken to by Roy Washburn (Thewlis, complete with odd Welsh accent). The answer is nothing much apart from that she is up to her old tricks again; Tramell still has the one-liners but she does not have the script writer to back her up, Tramell has the confidence and the attractiveness but she does not have a good male foil in the form of Michael Glass (Morrissey) to back the film itself up. A little sample of her dialogue this time round consists of things like: ""Is this where we'll do it?""; ""A hundred and ten, we must've hit a pot hole"" and ""I may never cum again""  all to men and all for supposed fun.But apart from the screenplay, which actually get worse when a Scottish reporter in a rather cheesy manner says ""I'll take that as a no then"" after Glass rips up his business card and leaves, it's the narrative and general logic of the characters that suffers. Glass is a psychiatrist but is conned into temptation and lust too easily for my liking; here is a man who's a doctor; who's an educated man that remains sexually active despite his credentials and yet Tramell seems to get his to think what she wants. So the character background is there but we pick up on Glass' life as he enters a bad patch of madness since over the course of the next fortnight, he'll tell a waitress ""I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you"" in a jovial manner; he fingers evidence at a crime scene and even manages to throw a piece of evidence away; he has all the clues spend so much time under his nose, that it's not even funny and manages to fall for a woman he has already rejected after she describes what sleeping with her is like. This is indeed a frantic and brain-dead fortnight in the life of Michael Glass.In the thriller genre, the film's crucible is where the grip is tightened as the audience edge ever closer to their seats edge since events happen, things occur and we see characters for what they might really be, but not here. Glass reads Tramell's book but when the events in the book actually happen, Glass cannot put it together. Things that Tramell actually tell him begin to happen like the ""ever visited a crime scene before?"" quote  sure enough Glass is at a crime scene later on and the guy has a belt around the neck, just like in the book. After these little occurrences, Basic Instinct 2 goes down a route that would confuse even those who have spent their life studying Luis Buñuel films. I say this because the film descends into a progression random and bizarre scenes; my favourite of which was when Glass followed Tramell to the red light district and watches her partake in an orgy  they stare at each other through the skylight in an odd and seemingly pointless exchange. Then there is the scene at Tramell's apartment when they have an altercation in her Jacuzzi  again, I was not fully understanding the logic behind showing such a scene especially since it isn't revisited later on. By the end, we are left disappointed, angry and somewhat sorry for what we have sat through with too many incidences taking place and not enough answers following them.",Basic Instinct 2
27,insomniac_rod,Worths the watch only for the not-so hot sex sequences. Go figure...,3,23 November 2008,"We didn't need a Hollywoodesque Erotic Thriller! That's why we stick with the goodness of Skinemax! It's really nerving that Sharon Stone tried to do a sexy, hot sequel to the extremely successful early 90's hit.The plot couldn't be less interesting and dull. To be honest and realistic, Sharon Stone is the main and only reason to watch this poor attempt to storm the box office. Of course, it didn't have success or anything; in fact, it will be remembered as one of the most unnecessary sequels of all time.One positive point is the incorporation of the super hot Flora Montgomery. Her sex scene was the highlight of the movie for me! A very hot and steamy scene involving a Sharon Stone picture. That's it. I found the best thing about this feature: See, every soft core flick has something ""good"" about it. Some of them feature hot women, or a memorable sequence, and in small cases a decent plot. Here, we have hot women and that's it.Watch it only for the sex scenes which aren't too steamy but oh well, it's Hollywood.Otherwise, stay away from this. It's completely utter trash.",Basic Instinct 2
28,Chris_Docker,film noir with a confusing cleavage,7,29 April 2006,"Sharon Stone has had a very chequered career, spanning performances that have garnered Golden Globes and Oscar nominations, as well as Razzies. Her performance in Casino convinced skeptics of her acting ability and yet it is for her portrayal of the sexily sinister author Catherine Tramell - in Basic Instinct - that she is perhaps most remembered. Basic Instinct II revives the role  a dangerous undertaking and one that many critics have panned (possibly without even watching it). Yet the character is an interesting one and deserves not to be dismissed so lightly, especially in this well-written sequel.The enigma of Tramell is whether, in researching her novels, she just gets very close to actual murders, or whether she actually commits them. In Basic Instinct II we become aware of a third possibility  that she manipulates people into creating interesting story lines, even if it means pushing them over the edge mentally and emotionally so they perhaps commit crimes they would not otherwise have committed. Following in the footsteps of twisted real-life authors recently depicted on screen such as Capote, such a possibility does not seem so preposterous.Where Basic Instinct II fails, is in capturing a suitable target audience. The original Basic Instinct, however good a thriller, is linked in the public imagination with a particularly explicit scene involving Stone uncrossing and crossing her legs during a police interview. Given the raunchy nature of Tramell's personal life, to which the film gave ample reign, the movie drew adult audiences hoping to be shocked. This creates a number of problems for Basic Instinct II. Firstly, the public taste for sexual explicitness seems to have ebbed. Sex scenes are more likely to kill a blockbuster than boost attendances. The independent and European films featuring explicit sexuality tend not to get multiplex coverage  and the limits are now so broad that most mainstream actresses are unlikely to want to push the envelope with such explicitness unless it is to test the limits of art  and Basic Instinct II, like its forerunner, is a thriller not an art house movie.Yet it suffers from the 'sex-movie' tag. Re-shot in black and white, with a shorter running time, and minimizing any nudity, Basic Instinct II could have been marketed as film noir. The difficulty of puzzling out the who-dunnit keeps the attention, but waiting for the next sex scene it just fizzles (as there's very little to wait for). With a running time of nearly two hours, some of the direction could have been tighter, but the overall feel of the movie almost creates a genre. Sharon Stone hones Tramell's character even better than in the original, and the final twist is difficult to anticipate. As a portrait of a genius writer that can run rings around police detectives and psycho-analysts, Basic Instinct delivers in spades. While Sharon Stone is a good-looking fortysomething, those watching it for sexy thrills may be disappointed.",Basic Instinct 2

I watched the film without any comparison and tried to watch the film from a fresh perspective but still got disappointed mainly due to loose approach towards the making of the film and under-cooked characters.The plot of both the films is almost similar with almost similar execution, the character is also not chosen wisely, it seems that Sharon Stone had completely outshone the character played by David Morrissey and he looked like a second string character.Screenplay of the film is average and doesn't excites much, the climax of film is senseless and doesn't gives any purpose to make this film.Acting is average and apart from Sharon Stone none of the character has been effective and is easily forgotten.Overall an average film with nothing new and exciting to offer, erotic thriller lovers might enjoy the film.",Basic Instinct 2

This sequel does work as a stand alone film. But somehow the script by Leora Barish (Desperately Seeking Susan) and Henry Bean (The Believer, Deep Cover, Internal Affairs) nearly sucked out the fun of this sequel. Which it's take this silly premise too seriously than it should and it explain why the sequel was an box office flop. But it's remains fairly watchable, thanks to a top cast and Caton-Jones' moody visual style.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an informative commentary track by the director, an featurette and deleted scenes with optional commentary by the director. This review is the Unrated Extended Cut. This version adds two minutes of additional footage. I seen this movie in theaters, i find it hard to spot of what added scenes in the Unrated Version. This sequel is somewhat of a guilty pleasure thanks to Stone's performance, she's still got what it takes to be the lethal Femme Fatale. This has nice supporting work from David Thewlis as a police detective and Charlotte Rampling as Dr. Glass' colleague. This picture is a highly forgettable misfire sequel. Only die-hard fans of Stone might enjoy her performance. This film has one of the most dumbest twist endings in a while and the film do suffers from unintentional laughs. That conclusion plays like an ending of your favorite Soap Operas on daytime television. Some of the better unintentional ones are coming from Morrissey's character. The opening sequence of the sequel are the best moments. I felt the only thing missing watching this sequel in the character of Detective Nick Curran (Two Time Oscar-Winner:Michael Douglas), he was certainly needed badly in this sequel. Part of the reason why the original was so much fun to watch, it was because Douglas' character as well. Watchable but nothing special. Too bad, the sex scenes are not erotic as well.

32,jfgibson73,Reasons Not To Care,2,9 September 2009,"I watched this movie because I heard a reviewer say that even though it was bad, it wasn't boring. I now know that this is not a good enough reason to see a movie. ""Not boring"" does not always mean entertaining. Sometimes it can mean that you may not like yourself for having sat through it.Basic Instinct 2 is an erotic thriller, which must be the genre that is easiest to produce a piece of trash from. In this movie, the main character is the psychiatrist who becomes obsessed with Sharon Stone's character and makes every possible bad decision until it eventually ruins his life. Now, because it involves temptation, murder, and a career in jeopardy, it may seem to justify its existence as a cautionary tale for adults. Actually, the behaviors in this movie don't reflect real life adults any more than Spongebob contains real children.I'm not going to give in to the argument that this was just meant as entertainment, is supposed to be escape or enjoyment and not taken seriously. This movie takes itself VERY seriously and works very hard to be grown-up. I don't mind a movie that has a dark tone if it does so to show us that sometimes the world really is bleak. Basic Instinct 2 is sour and joyless because it wants to appear deadly serious.If you were to watch a movie about, say, Darfur and the difficulties its people are going through, imagine how upset you would be if you found out afterward that the writer had never been there and nothing you had seen about the people or the place resembled reality. Even when a story is set in a complete fantasy world, it can still show you something truthful about human nature. Here is a movie that is set in the real world, but employs characters that are complete fantasies. I think that kind of emptiness is a reason not to recommend a movie.",Basic Instinct 2

34,EUyeshima,Desperately Joyless Sequel Misses Its Destiny as a Black Comedy,1,27 July 2006,"This is awful stuff but not for the obvious reasons. The most offensive aspect of this too-delinquent 2006 sequel to the 1992 box office hit is that it pretends to be a double-dip psychological thriller as well as yet another did-she-or-didn't-she sex crime story. Personally, I think there was great potential to turn this into a very black comedy about female empowerment, but the irony seems lost on the filmmakers. The net effect of all this heavy lifting in the plot is this enervating feeling that the movie will never end. The overly complicated screenplay by Leora Barish and Henry Bean is not the only culprit here, as Michael Caton-Jones' direction is pedestrian and plodding. Even the explicit sex scenes are captured in a rather clinical manner that generates nothing close to heat.The plot picks up crime novelist Catherine Tramell years (fourteen to be exact) after her San Francisco police troubles. Relocated to London, she gets implicated in the car crash death of her soccer player lover (she, of course, was driving). Enter police psychologist Dr. Michael Glass to assess her mental state, and the sexually oriented dangers from the first movie get recycled in this story. People start to get murdered. Inevitably, Glass gets painted into a corner, while Catherine keeps one step ahead of everyone else. It seems beside the point that Sharon Stone looks great for 47, though there is a surgical aura about her beauty (whether or not this is the case). Her nihilistic character has not been empowered by the intervening years but flattened into a one-note Machiavellian nymphomaniac, all knowing looks and come-ons with nary a trace of humanity. The fun in her performance has been deflated to fit the constant contrivances of the plot turns.She gets no help from her pasty-looking leading man, David Morrissey, who looks and sounds like the younger brother of Liam Neeson. He lacks the charisma and primal instincts to get away with Glass' quicksilver changes in behavior, especially in the sex scenes. The most inspired in-joke is placing the doctor's office in London's phallic-looking Swiss Re building. It seems a shame to recruit two world-class actors in supporting roles only to waste them  David Thewlis plays the suspicious police inspector, and Charlotte Rampling, looking spectacular at sixty (and a lesson in humility for Ms.Stone), as Glass' more seasoned colleague. Suffice it to say that the last five minutes are absurd to the extreme with no sense of viewer satisfaction over the conclusion.The journey from theaters to DVD has been an unsurprisingly fast one, and the disc includes Caton-Jones' rather bored commentary on an alternative track, and there are several deleted scenes all wisely excised. In fact, not enough was excised for my taste. There is also a disposable ten-minute making-of featurette where there is mention (or dare I say, the threat) of a ""Basic Instinct 3"". Perhaps they can get Dakota Fanning for the role.",Basic Instinct 2
35,aharmas,what a sad waste of Stone's marvelous character,2,1 April 2006,"I had been looking forward to catching the sequel to ""Basic Instinct"", a film that was inspired by a twisted admiration for a killer that actually gets away with it and enjoys every minute of it. The original had Stone, portraying the sassy and sexy writer who might or might not be a killer (depending on what you want to believe). She was a terrific, beautiful, and intelligent manipulator who pushed every single male's, and some females' buttons. She remains as powerful and bewitching as ever, but this time, she manages to wander into a mire of banal and polluted talent.Catherine is now in England, still seeking thrills and inspiration for what will give her another successful bestseller. Does her creativity lead to the destruction of others? Is she just ""lucky"" enough to wander into a pile of stupid people who surrender to her charms and find themselves involved in a mess of their own design? These are tantalizing prospects that never come to full realization in the film. Instead, we are given an awful, half-cooked mess of a script that can't ever survive the terrific sets and some new provocative outfits for Stone.Her poses are still effective and were the only things that kept me from slapping a zero on this film, but she can't fight everything that is wrong with this movie. In fact, there are a couple of things when we see how powerful an actress and incredible her Catharine could be in the right film. The closing scene hints at what could have been as she slowly details the plot of her novel to one of her victims. These last minutes show how much the camera can love an actress with the magnetic star power Stone has, but it is not enough. One can only wish she doesn't go the way of Indiana Jones, and someone gives us the opportunity to see her in her full glory (no pun intended).Too bad.",Basic Instinct 2

She turns herself in to the police and begins to tell all sorts of cocky Faux sophisticated stories about how the bloke died and how she tried to save him but had to save herself first etc. etc. Det. Supt. Roy Washburn (played by David Thewlis) doesn't buy her for a single second and just wants to throw her into the nearest jail, but then her defense council introduces a psychiatrist whom they send in to evaluate Catherine. Dr. Michael Glass is played to perfection (with a great transitional prelude on his part) by David Morrissey and the minute he and Catherine Tramel meet, you just know what is going to happen for the rest of the film. Charlotte Rampling is stunning as Dr. Milena Gardosh, a friend and close colleague of Dr. Glass, and she (Rampling) probably turns in the best performance in the entire film. Stone on the other hand is a wreck who takes herself too seriously. Her and her Uber perpetual bad hair day and not to mention druggie look, her stylist really did her character wrong. The Dialogue was horrible! The plot twists were disastrously unbelievable and Sharon Stone was just all-round bad! The entire film turned out to be like masterpiece theater gone awry!Oh! and the recent trend of casting one major American actor or actress against a bunch of actors for the UK is revisited in this film as well ala 'Paranoia with Jessica Alba, Love Actually with Laura Linney, and The truth about love with Jennifer Love Hewitt' just to mention a few. Indira Varma plays a subtle ex. Mrs. Denise Glass in a mild cameo and even with that she did way better than Sharon that's for sure but not enough to save the film.",Basic Instinct 2
39,Sandcooler,Can't even move her face or anything,3,14 December 2008,"The problem with this is pretty obvious, but sadly pretty fundamental: the script sucks. They tried to go for a rip-off of the original and couldn't even pull that of. The point is exactly the same, you have this Catherine Tramell(though she doesn't even look like the same person anymore), and she kills people and then finds some guy for the sake of using a web of lies on him. But here's the exciting new twist, now it's set in England. Wow. Pathetic. As the film progresses, and when it's supposed to get interesting, it just gets worse and worse. I mean the ending just doesn't make any sense. Tramell is supposed to be always in control and omnipotent and whatnot, but seriously the chances of her new devil plan to work were like zero, she just trusts on the fact that the completely charisma-less psychiatrist(you actually forget him while he's on screen, he just blends in with the wall) is a moron. In the original, which is starting to look like a pretty good movie, stuff just looked cool. This is gray and lifeless. And you could see that coming from miles away really. Just sad, ruins a perfectly good movie character for me.",Basic Instinct 2
40,antoniotierno,Unenjoyable,5,19 April 2006,"It's neither a soft core porno film nor a cop thriller. One of the main reasons why the audience has been expecting this film was to find out whether Sharon Stone would be up to the fame of sexy icon. Well, this is one of the most unerotic flicks I've ever seen, though Catherine Trammel is very attractive for the age she is (48). Basically it's the same plot as the one starring Michael Douglas, except for the setting moved from US (San Francisco) to UK (London) but having nothing thrilling of its predecessor. In fact Douglas kept off this sequel, in reason I could say, whereas Sharon Stone wanted to invigorate her image and accepted that useless role.",Basic Instinct 2
41,jon.h.ochiai,Mesmerizing Trash,5,3 April 2006,"""Basic Instincts 2"" is like watching a train wreck unfolding, and you can't take your eyes off it. ""Basic Instincts 2"" is mesmerizing trash at its best, and some of the glossiest camp. No, this is not praise for Director Michael Caton-Jones's sequel to the 1992 erotic thriller, rather an experiential indictment. Sharon Stone, returning as the deadly author and sexual predator Catherine Tramell, is great and at her smoldering best. The movie itself is not so great. Stone reprises her star breakthrough role of Catherine from ""Basic Instincts"". Granted the original ""Basic Instincts"" was a somewhat predictable erotic thriller notorious for the crotch baring scene of Stone. However, Stone's screen magnetism and brazen portrayal elevated her to stardom. In ""Basic Instincts 2"" Stone's smoldering swagger as the all devouring sexual predator Catherine is the only compelling aspect of the movie. Sharon Stone looks absolutely stunning. Caton-Jones's 'Instincts 2' is sleek and stylish looking too, but the shiny objects eventually tarnish.The story by Leora Barish and Henry Bean opens with a bangso to speak. Catherine (Stone) drives while climaxing in her sports car tearing through the streets of London with drugged out boy toy soccer star Kevin Franks (played by soccer star Stan Collymore) and crashes into the river. Fortunately, Catherine is able to escape the car and surface to safety. Held in custody along with circumstantial evidence for the murder of her lover by Detective Roy Washburn (David Thewlis), Catherine undergoes a psychological profile with psychiatrist Dr. Michael Glass (David Morrissey). Dr. Glass possesses his own demonsa patient under his watch murdered his girl friend after confessing his desire to do so. Glass suffered a 7 year meltdown during which time his wife Denise (Indira Varma) left him for reporter Adam Towers (Hughe Darcy). Towers writes a story about Glass's mishap. Glass predictably is aroused and drawn to Catherine (Stone), and renders his diagnosis to the courts that Catherine suffers from ""risk addiction"". Convoluted? Yes. Preposterous? Absolutely. Barish and Bean's screenplay begins superfluously complex then quickly spirals into the completely ridiculous. The resolution of ""Basic Instincts 2"" is either revisionist genius or just plain embarrassing. I lean to the latter.One of the many miscalculations of ""Basic Instincts 2"" is that Morrissey's Glass folds under the shear force and charisma of Stone's Catherine. Morrissey is a good actor, but may have been woefully miscast. His Glass is more sensitive and complicated as opposed to the dangerously trapped animal. For a sexual thriller ""Basic Instincts 2"" seems more camp than eroticcompared to its predecessor. Another miscalculation. The lurid discourse between Tramell and Glass at times although unintentional, bordered on ludicrous. Shockingly given such glossy camp, Stone isn't more naked to compensate for the dreadful writing. This will likely be amended in the DVD director's cut release. Barish and Bean's narrative mess does retain unintentional entertainment value.The performances under Caton-Jones's direction are scattered. Morrissey as Glass suffers valiantly under the weight of an ill conceived character. Indira Varma is interesting as Glass's scorned ex-wife who is sleeping with reporter Adam Towers (Darcy). Both Varma and Darcy's roles are mere plot devices. David Thewlis is convincing as Detective Washburn, who strangely is obsessed with convicting Catherine. The great Charlotte Rampling fairs better as Glass's mentor Milena Gardosh who warns him, ""You're falling in love with her."" Other than Stone as Catherine, she is the only one who apparently retains her wits. Ultimately, ""Basic Instincts 2"" is all about Sharon Stone's Catherine Tramell. As Catherine, Stone is the icon of icy cool and deadly sexuality. This time around she strips Catherine of any vulnerability. She is merciless. Oddly enough that works for her. Watching her as Catherine is the only compelling aspect of ""Basic Instincts 2"". As mind bending stupid as the movie devolves, one is captivated by what Stone as Catherine will do next. Consequently, that may warrant waiting to see a better Sharon Stone movie.",Basic Instinct 2
42,juliankennedy23,Instinct says run,4,28 November 2006,"Basic Instinct 2: 4 out of 10: I understand the urge of some to declare this a guilty pleasure. After all the entire movie is fascinatingly ridiculous. Sharon Stone's character from the first film has turned into a tour de force caricature. Yes she is too old to play the role but as written I can't think of any other actress who could play it either.The idea that any of the characters would find her so appealing that they would jettison any shred of common sense out of the window is nuts. It's not so much the physical as mental. Her character screams look at me I am psychotic. Now certainly some of us have been guilty of being seduced by a patently psychotic middle aged nymphomaniac, but alcohol and late hours not to mention a dimly lit bar are usually involved. To be seduced by such a creature in the sober light of day is pure science fiction.Indeed every character in the movie seems inexplicably smitten in one way or the other by Stone. I can buy one disturbed and naive character such as the baby faced psychiatrist going nuts over her but his ex-wife and her lover as well? The movie has other faults as well. There really isn't all that much sex and it does drag at times. And while beautifully shot the lack of cohesive story and supposed twists are more yawn inducing than shocking.Certainly the film is worth a look just for Stone's over the top performance but don't be surprised if you check your watch while shaking your head in disbelief.",Basic Instinct 2
43,MihaiSorinToma,A less impressive sequel,7,7 September 2017,"The same wealthy, sexy and perverse woman from the first installment is accused of murdering her partner and as a result, she starts visiting and courting at the same time, a young psychologist with a troubled past of his own. He tries to understand her peculiar character but the more he gets involved, the more he seems attracted to her in a seduction game which is apparently out of his league. As more and more characters around them continue to die without any traces, he gets into a lot of trouble as the protagonist of the first movie, ending up in a very unexpected position.This movie tries to continue the first movie's story, using the same but much older woman antagonist but unfortunately is not able to be on par with it. Unlike its predecessor, this one does not feature as much action. On the contrary, it is slow paced and sometimes dull, focusing much more on the mystery than on the action. This is regrettable because it reduces the excitement this kind of movie could offer, making it less appealing. It's a good movie with good actors and a good plot but it falls behind in terms of action.",Basic Instinct 2
44,russem31,Average,5,2 April 2006,"Unlike the first film, this sequel Basic Instinct 2, is sub par at best. Sharon Stone returns in the role that made her career - that of high risk and sexy blonde, Catherine Davis Tramell - to her credit, Sharon Stone does the best job she can to portray the sexy vixen, though the 47 years of age that she was when this was filmed does show (however, she looks REALLY good for 47). Even the story isn't that bad, I went in expecting this film to be awful and I was pleasantly surprised that is wasn't bad. Director Paul Verhoeven, writer Joe Eszterhas, Michael Douglas as Det. Nick Curran are sorely missed in this sequel. And though the late Jerry Goldsmith's exceptional score to the first film does come through in snippets here and there, the original score by John Murphy is so different from Goldsmith's that it's jarring to hear two very different scores in the same movie. I must say in the end, though it was nice to see Sharon Stone reprise her famous character, this film is overall only average - all in all, a 5 out of 10.",Basic Instinct 2
45,mario_c,A powerful mind twist,7,6 April 2006,"The sequel of Basic Instinct won't be for sure a remarkable movie, as the original one, but we cannot say it's awful, because it isn't. In fact, I think it's quite good.The main reason why so many people think this movie is so awful is because they compare this one, more than they should, to the original one! Beside that, the expectation for this sequel was very high (many people expected the sequel since 1992!), and when that happens it's very hard to have success. In most cases it's condemned to fail. But in my opinion, this movie didn't fail, especially because it's a powerful mind twist!All the plot is a twisted labyrinth where lies and deceives mix together with killer instinct. It's a game to survive! Of course Sharon Stone is not so ""hot"" in this sequel as she was in the original, nor either exist any ""unusual sexy scene"" (cross legs' scene), but on the other hand I think she has refined her ""killer instinct""! In the original, her character was provocative, seductive and manipulative, but it didn't have the coldness and the evilness on its sight, as it has now at the sequel! The way she manipulates the psychologist and the way she looks at him, is really cold, wicked, in a word: evil!So, generally, I don't think this movie is brilliant - in fact, it's far away from that - but it's not as bad as some people told!",Basic Instinct 2
46,Pedro_H,Hysterical and overblown airport trash - but easier to watch than many Oscar winners!,7,15 May 2007,"Let me be up-front, I like pulp. However it is like one of these ""easier dives"" that you see at the Olympics. It has to be marked down a little because it is easier to give a cheap thrill than drag you inside the world of, say, a late medieval painter.This is only a two hour ghost train ride and while often (or more accurately, most of the time!) ludicrous and unlikely it always goes forward and it always entertains. If not always in the right way. Check out the memorable quotes section for a chuckle.(However quite why it has been given a ""Worst Film"" Razzie is baffling - I bet there was a thousand worse films made in 2006, but this film got the treatment because it was viewed as a fashionable victim.) Head case and popular novelist Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone) is now over in London writing a novel, but death and destruction follow her around like flies follow a horse during a spot of hot weather. God heavens, she can't even visit the toilet without tripping over at least two corpses and I am sure if she opened the closet in her vast penthouse flat one would come tumbling out in grand Hollywood style.Yes, clearly a very dangerous lady to be circling around (if you like your pulse to be above zero), but is she personally responsible? I mean why would anyone put two-and-two together and start thinking she might be a murderer? Equally her reaction to such accusations seems very casual. However is this just a personality disorder (some form of b/s risk addiction) or further evidence of her guilt? For reasons I cannot fully understand or explain Stone is assigned to psychiatrist Michael Glass (David Morrissey) for evaluation rather than taken down the cells following another ""lover found dead in mysterious circumstances"". Thankfully (for Stone) he is far crazier than any of his patients and has a troubled home/working life of his own. In the blink of an eye the relationship changes from doctor to patient and then it is hard to tell because it all becomes something of a revolving blur.In to this heady mix comes Roy Washburn (a strange Welsh sounding David Thewlis) who tells the love struck doctor - in his capacity of policeman of many years standing - that the lady in question may be dangerous. I mean, hold the front page. However Glass is now too glassy-eyed to realise or care. Like a dizzy boxer in front of a prime-time Mike Tyson he ripe for the big take-down, however not before finding that Washburn might have a secret or two himself.Now comes Millena Gardosh (Charlotte Rampling) a fellow psychiatrist and a rare example (in this film) of someone who isn't barking mad or else a murder suspect. Presuming that she has actually watched the finished film she must look back with nostalgia when her underwear came off with the ease of Stone's - thankfully (for us at least) those days are long gone. Strangely she doesn't think Stone is quite as dangerous as everyone else - or else she doesn't think the script is good enough or her cheque large enough to do any proper acting.After several laps of the track roughly outlined above it comes to a climax that mixes provincial rep with a cliff-hanger/twist, that while as farcical as the rest of the movie, gives us enough elbowroom for Basic Instinct 3 - highly unlikely this may be at this point in time.",Basic Instinct 2
47,FloatingOpera7,"O, If Only Basic Instinct 2 Had Been Released in 1995",6,9 April 2006,"Basic Instinct 2 (2006) Starring Sharone Stone, David Morissey, David Thewlis, Charlotte Rampling, Hugh Dancy, Anne Caillon....Basic Instinct Part I was released in 1992. Sharon Stone became a huge star and a sex icon of the early 90's (everyone recalls the unforgettable Interrogation Scene in which she uncrosses her legs). She was only 34 at that time and exuded both fierce venom, total depravity and evil, and sexual magnetism and alluring beauty. Michael Douglas was only 48, but quite virile and young-looking. They had genuine chemistry and their love scenes, in which both appeared in the buff, was mesmerizing, the hot stuff you see on late night HBO or Cinemax. Stone is now 48 and Douglas is 62. Obviously, for the sequel they could not cast the aging Michael Douglas and so instead they cast the younger David Morissey as her latest prey. Miss Stone has had a lot of plastic surgery or has preserved her body so well through physical fitness, yoga, or age-reducing products that she looks almost as beautiful as she did in Basic Instinct I. But she should know better than to appear in a sequel to a highly successful first film just for eye candy. Her lines seem tacked-on at the last minute, she seems to be repeating what she said in the first film, she offers no real character development and remains uninteresting. The only thing has changed about the film is the location from the States to London, possibly in the hopes that the bleak urban London scene would create an eerie, mysterious and frightening mood. The majority of the actors in the cast are British and seem to talk a great deal but don't act their parts with any real vitality or intensity as the other actors in Basic Instinct 1. So, just why was this film a big flop at the box office ? Because, quite frankly, the sequel came to late. Maybe no one has stopped to think that if this film had been released in 1995, at least 2-3 years after Basic Instinct Part I, the movie would have garnered greater critical acclaim. But NOOOOO! They waited 14 years later. If the film had been released in 1995, Sharon Stone would have still been naturally beautiful and Douglas would have still been hot, and audiences would have been treated to a better film. If the writer/writers had come up with a intense, dramatically compelling sequel in 1995 which wraps things up so that it wouldn't be a trilogy (Basic Instince 3 is no longer possible), then this movie would have been terrific. No matter how hard this film tries to imitate the original or appear as thrilling, it does not impress. The script is lousy, the acting is weak, the music is bland, the whole thing is a mess. Not even fans of Basic Instinct are pleased, or fans of Sharon Stone. This is a terrible movie that should not have been made, or at least not at this time. It should have been made much earlier, while it was still the 90's. Interesting note: In 1995, (the time I wish this film had been made) Sharon Stone was busy in a Western film (I forget the title) and Douglas was filming the American President in which he played the President. If only they had squeezed in Basic Instinct 2 at that time, I'm 100 percent sure that this film would have been greater. Nothing beats the greatness of the first film.",Basic Instinct 2

49,DonFishies,"A cheesy sequel that should have been made well before now, if at all",3,30 September 2006,"I never managed to watch all of Basic Instinct for one reason or another. Of course, I have seen pieces of it (including the most notorious scene from it), but never from beginning to end. Despite this, I gave the recent sequel, Basic Instinct 2 a whirl. And like everyone could have predicted from the start, it is quite terrible albeit not as bad as I thought it would be.After a fairly intriguing opening, we catch back up with Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone). She has apparently relocated to London since we last saw her, and she is being charged with murder. Detective Roy Washburn (David Thewlis) wants her behind bars, but since the murder cannot be proved, he needs to have a state psychologist examine her. So enter Dr. Michael Glass (David Morrissey). He thinks she may re-offend, and despite his testimony in court, Tramell manages to get out on bail. But she feels the need to get some help, so she enlists Glass to be her therapist. And then the bodies start piling up.This is without a shadow of doubt, one of those sequels labeled ""should have been made less than 14 years ago, or not at all"". Basic Instinct was fresh (or fairly fresh) back in 1992. A lot of copycats and ripoffs have come and gone since, and now we finally have a sequel. The film smells stale from the start, and fails to pick up at all through its two hour running time. It just does not have any zest or even feel like a real story unfolding. It just looks like a really confused guy with a jones for a great-looking woman, who just happens to be turning 50 in less than two years, mixed in a blender with a half-assed plot. The weakness emits itself throughout, and the film just cannot get anywhere away from it.Moving the action to London felt like a good match, but never do we really actually feel like we are in London. There is almost nothing to suggest it being any different than an American city. The cinematography is interesting to watch however, as despite the undistinguishing features, the bright colours and great scenery all look beautiful for the camera. Some of the costumes Stone manages to put herself into are also quite interesting in their own way. The writing itself is cheese all the way, and none of the actors really make a valiant try at helping to make it any better. They seemed content at what it was at, and really did not care what everyone else thought.Morrissey tries his best here, but he's too young and innocent looking to actually believably get wrapped up in the web of Catherine Tramell. Michael Douglas had edge. This guy has an expressionless face, and not much else. He tries playing off all of the other actors, but he just does not have any chemistry with a single soul, and just looks and feels totally awkward. It may be the problem in the fact that Morrissey did not bother making the almost two-dimensional character any better, or it just may be that he is not that great an actor (but I have yet to see any other films with him starring in it, so I will just leave that out).Stone, while her physique is absolutely stunning to look at (especially out of the clothes, which takes almost an hour before we see), just sounds too old for this role. She is well past her prime, and she is still trying to do the roles that got her fame back when she was younger. Her face looks nowhere near as perfect as her body, and neither does her posture. When she is sitting trying to seduce Glass, you are unsure of whether she is believing what she is telling him, or is looking at the material and wondering why she even bothers. Her character is supposed to have stronger potential than Morrissey's, but they really feel like they are on the same page (and what is up with practically tearing out all that lesbian subtext from the original film?).Thewlis on the other hand, despite his very small role, is excellent as the ""corrupt"" detective. He has the charisma, the zest and the actual morphing of the character to allow himself to feel real. He carries the film on his shoulder when he is around, and is one of the key reasons why this movie is mildly watchable. He gives poetic justice to some of the most horrific dialogue I have ever heard, and looks great saying it. More than everyone else can say for themselves.While it is muddled by all sorts of issues, Basic Instinct 2 is not a bad choice for some random escapism. Just do not go in expecting it to be anything amazing, or anywhere near as good as the first one (or at least, the brief parts that I have).3/10.",Basic Instinct 2

Yes, these lifeless and colorful-less characters can really dull a movie...but through it all, Sharon Stone still does her thing.No pussy shot in this one - even though you think you're gonna get one.The tension is gone, but somehow, someway it still keeps your eyes glued to the screen.However, it's time to retire the Basic Instinct movie lie and let her age slowly in other movies.Her face is beginning to show lines and if she has to wait another 14 years to make a movie, it just might be filmed in an old age home.This movie is a rainy day viewer and watching the two in sequence will definitely make you wonder why it took 14 years to complete.",Basic Instinct 2
52,Flagrant-Baronessa,Tacky embarrassing cheese-fest,3,10 August 2006,"This is not the worst film I have ever seen nor is it the most cringeworthy, but it is definitely a contender. It has maybe 1-2 redeeming factors like scenery and score but you can impossibly build a decent movie on this alone - you need a solid template plot to facilitate the whole thing and this is something that Basic Instinct 2 (2006) simply lacks. It is meant as a sexy enticing cat-and-mouse game between novelist Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone) and the psycho-analyst Dr. Glass (David Morrissey) who works with her, but this ends up unengaging.This film 'cleverly' invents its own logic to propel an inane plot but then, so did Basic Instinct so you can hardly judge it too harshly on this point. If it works, then who cares about logic? The sad news is, this film doesn't work. Not even a little bit. Not even if you desperately want it to. People's film taste and demands change and are not the same as in 1992, so making a sequel fourteen years later with a near identical approach as the original is just a bad idea. The pseudo-dark sex games schtick is misused, overused and endlessly tiring.What's worse is that there isn't even THAT much sex in the film, just the idea of sex and sensuality, teasing, flirting, and enticing the viewer (except it was more annoying than enticing). Morrissey and Stone have decent chemistry (no, they really do) but they have completely different ways of acting. Morrissey underacts and Stone overacts so it is painful to see them in a scene together as both methods get so highlighted and look so ridiculous juxtaposed with each other. Where's the middle-ground, people?I don't know what Sharon Stone is trying to prove in doing this cheesy thriller because she's always been stunning and she still good great today. We all know this. But here she ends up a shamelessly vulgar old lady - the kind that makes you uncomfortable to be around - playing her silly pseudo-dark sex games and writing sexy novels, desperately trying to convince us how sensual she is in every scene.

Catherine Tramell (Stone) masterfully manipulates a well educated group of people's lives, playing on their frailties to collect experiences to write a murder mystery book. She plays the female psychopath quite well while using her ample sex appeal to convincingly portray what could be considered one of the ultimate Black Widows. Tramell is use to dark places within society and freely partakes in sadomasochistic flings in the 'never visit after dark' side of town. From the beginning, there is nothing short of an R rating here from the dialog alone.

Though, like Detective Nick Curran before him, Glass is entranced by Tramell and lured into a seductive game as she pushes him to the cinemax.I should make it known that this review comes from the perspective of someone who has not seen the original Paul Verhoeven film and whose only interest in it comes from it's overwhelmingly negative critical reception upon release. So bad it's good you say? Hold my San Pellegrino.Much like the 2002 remake of Rollerball, another box office bomb from the 2000s, Basic Instinct 2 is reported to have had an elongated and deeply troubled production history spanning six years at the least, mostly revolving it seems around Sharon Stone's ego and, understandably, hesitation. Especially when the question needs to be asked about why did certain producers wanted so desperately to see this film made.Numerous recastings and one class action lawsuit later, Basic Instinct 2 made its way into cinemas. And unsurprisingly, that's the most remarkable thing you can say about the film, that it exists. Because several decent performances and brisk pace aside, there is no avoiding the sense that Basic Instinct 2 was the Justice League of it's time.Let gets the awful out the way first, shall we. The cinematography in this is extremely flat. Considering the $70 million budget, it's amazing how much actually went onto background artists and not a more elaborate lighting plan or more ambitious shot composition. I can't really pinpoint what makes this film look cheap, but it does. It looks like an expensive cinemax movie and no more.Though the story is good as a boilerplate thriller, the plot twists are still ludicrous and some dialogue truly autistic. It's bad. Just not bad enough to be thoroughly entertaining throughout.Now let's move onto the good. The characters are merely functional, but they are well acted. David Thewils was a particular highlight i found. The score is polished, the editing is on point and as a result, the pacing is tight. The reason why the plot in this film is so infamously stupid. The craft was fine enough that people would be engrossed enough and actually acknowledge that sort of thing.Rounding this off, I'll say that Basic Instinct 2 is nowhere near the unsalvageable bomb it was seen as at the time of it's release, more or less entirely due to the cast who all understood what kind of film they were in. But, it still features an unremarkable story, inane dialogue and artless cinematography, and in no way should be seen as anything but a film that outstayed it's welcome ten years before it was even made.",Basic Instinct 2

We get to see film revolve around Glass and Tramell in their web of entanglement just like Curran and Tramell in the first film.Added to that,we also see how many murders occur during this investigation and how Glass destroys himself just like Curran as she falls into Tramell's seduction.Unlike the first movie,this film definitely was inferior.The characters are less interesting as they are practically less intense and lifeless especially Morrissey in his portrayal as Glass.Added to that,the dialogues are less memorable,less intense,and less exciting. Finally,the sexuality was definitely toned down. Too bad that Stone wanted to bare more flesh in this film as it would be her last hurrah in terms of sexual and sexy roles.Too bad that the filmmakers made it less sensual that led the film less interesting.Overall,it is still worth to watch. But don't expect it to be as good as the first film.Others would even be disappointed with it.",Basic Instinct 2
56,christian123,"Besides for Sharon Stone, this sequel is a mess",1,27 July 2006,"Novelist Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone) is once again in trouble with the law, this time in England, where her sports star boyfriend has turned up dead. She's assigned a psychiatrist, Dr. Michael Glass (David Morrissey), which gives her the perfect opportunity to resume her sexual antics.The original Basic Instinct was a pretty good movie. It was erotic, unpredictable, engaging and it was just a fun movie to watch. Unfortunately, Basic Instinct 2 takes a giant step back from the original's appeal. It's dull, not erotic, not engaging and not a lot of fun either. The premise is actually pretty good. I think Henry Bean and Leora Barish did an okay job with the script. They offered some nice twists and at least they made the audience think. The ending was also pretty good though it's left open for another sequel which is not a good thing.Besides for Sharon Stone, the acting is very weak. David Morrissey plays Dr. Michael Glass and he gives a horrible performance. It was bland, dull and he put no emotion into the role. His performance hurts the movie because he is the main character. He gets the most screen time and he takes the film down with him. It's too bad that they didn't find someone else. Charlotte Rampling was pretty bland herself and her character had potential to be a lot more interesting. David Thewlis was just okay, nothing special. The only good performance was given by Sharon Stone. It was a little cheesy but she's still a lot of fun to watch on screen. However, they still wasted her talents in this weak sequel.Director Michael Caton-Jones does a poor job behind the camera. He moved the film at a slow pace. He introduced pointless characters and he didn't develop the central characters very well. Most of them were pretty bland and none of them broke out of their one dimensional personalities. He was clearly not the right man for the job since he has very little imagination. He just used a bunch of ideas and themes from the first movie. This sequel felt more like a rehash than anything else. The cinematography was pretty good and it was a nice portrayal of London. The score was also decent though a little generic. After finishing this movie, I was wondering why it took them so long to make a sequel. Sharon Stone still looks amazing but the film was not worth the wait. In the end, Basic Instinct 2 is a poor sequel that's not worth watching. Rating 3/10",Basic Instinct 2
57,nobbytatoes,"glossy, trashing, indulgent romp",6,12 September 2006,"Jumping from America, now settled in England, crime novelist Catherine Tramell doesn't take long to be the center of another murder case. While speeding around London, living a sexual fantasy with Kevin Franks, Catherine crashes the car into the river, killing Franks while she escapes. Questioned by the police, Tramell is appointed too psychiatrist Dr. Michael Glass. Glass concluded that Tramell is a risk addict, constantly taking bigger risks to prove something to herself. While Tramell is released from charges, Glass starts a downward spiral falling for Tramell, while she starts her mind game.Basic Instinct 2 is another one of those sequels that has come after a long hiatus from the original. Paul Verhoeven's original film Basic Instict was a highly indulgent, sexy romp, crime thriller. Hedonistic sexual pleasure and violence with class. Basic Instinct 2 ramps the hedonism and drops the class. Director Michael Caton-Jones has created slick, glossy, trashy, day-time soap opera, with enough crass to skyrocket the camp levels.There is pleasure in Basic Instinct 2, but there's a miss fire this time. It's not a sassy mystery, but an overly drawn out soap opera; with overly dramatic close ups abundant. Tramell's mind games with Glass, run just the same as her games with Nick Curran, so there is a lot of deja vu, even with some of the scenes; the night club and the sex scenes. Though it's the mind games and Tramell's brashness that keep you glued. The cheesy innuendo and one liners; ""Im worried I'll never c*m again"", smack you with bluntness but end with you gaining a giant smirk across your face.It's Sharon Stone's presences which holds things together and keeps proceedings moving. She plays vixen Tramell so well; the character which made her the superstar. She makes Tramell such an enigma, you never really know what she's thinking, behind her sexy facade. The rest of the cast pales to Sharon. David Morrissey always looks on edge and constantly nervous working beside Stone. David Thewlis just flounders around the place.You're best to stick with Verhoeven's Basic Instincts, but if you want some hedonistic, indulgent trash, you have a winner right here.",Basic Instinct 2
58,Gunnar_Runar_Ingibjargarson,One of the worst in the 00's,2,17 June 2008,"Despite its inevitable fate as a critically reviled box-office flop, Basic Instinct 2 sure has a funny way of holding your attention. It's not just Sharon Stone's trash-talk and occasional nudity that keeps you watching, but also the way she gamely earns every cent of her $14 million paycheck, vamping like a real pro in her second outing as mystery novelist and alleged serial killer Catherine Tramell. Now living in London, Catherine sets her lethal sights on Michael Glass (David Morrissey), the control-freak psychiatrist assigned to evaluate her as a risk-addicted suspect in the ""accidental"" killing of a star soccer player. Turns out Catherine's just getting started (or is she?), and that's bad news for Glass's ex-wife, a tabloid journalist, and the Scotland Yard detective (David Thewlis) who's desperate to put Catherine in jail. With plenty of sex, murder and salacious dialog, BI2 is certainly never boring, especially with the morbid fascination of seeing the once formidable Stone torpedo her career in a sequel that took 14 years (and countless drafts of screenplays and at least one high-profile lawsuit) to bring to the screen. She's still impressively hot at age 47, prompting critic Roger Ebert to observe, ""the Catherine Tramell role cannot be played well, but Sharon Stone can play it badly better than any other actress alive."" So, while this ill-fated sequel falls just short of being a guilty pleasure (if only because Morrissey is no match for Michael Douglas in the 1992 original), it's enjoyably absurd and slickly produced, and the hot-tub scene is guaranteed to wear out the freeze-frame function on a lot of DVD players.

61,jaibo,"""Even Oedipus didn't see his mother coming""",7,10 August 2008,"A recipient of much critical derision, Basic Instinct 2 is actually one of the best mainstream films of recent years. It's not as good as the original, but it does many intriguing and provocative things with the character of Catherine Trammell, portrayed in a performance of virtuoso cheek by Sharon Stone, the most underused actress in Hollywood.The plot echoes and extends the first film: Catherine is involved with a mysterious death - this time the drive in and drown demise of a celebrity footballer (played by the real-life caught-dogging soccer star Stan Collymore) - and is sent to a top psychiatrist for evaluation. The psych - played by British PM Gordon Brown-surrogate David Morrissey - is entrammelled into Catherine's world of pulp fiction, sent mad and bad and finally incarcerated in a mental home as a dangerous psychotic - his mind as blown as his dick.The psychiatrist and the cop investigating Catherine are both figures of establishment patriarchy with feet of clay. The psychiatrist is a control freak who spectacularly mismanaged a previous case; the cop (a very funny David Thewlis) is both sexist (his first line refers to Catherine as a ""c*nt"") and corrupt, given to planting evidence when he thinks someone is guilty. These interior faults bring them under the sway of Catherine, leading to their undoing and her final triumph.Who is Catherine Tramell? As in the first film, but here exaggerated to giddy extremes, she is a demiurge and mythic figure, described by one character as thinking ""she is one moment omnipotent and the next has no existence at all."" She is the basic life force itself (Shaw might have appreciated these films), making mockery of men's attempts to build a rational civilisation, and emerging victorious because rationality is itself full of fault-lines and fictions. The men in the film are inexorably led to their fates, like characters in Greek tragedy - as explicitly acknowledged in the film: Catherine turns to the psychiatrist and says ""Don't take it so hard - even Oedipus didn't see his mother coming."" Set in a post-modern London which stretches to extremes the Deleuzian notions of any-space-whatevers - ""this could be anywhere, most likely could be any frontier, any hemisphere"" - the film offers a vision of a phallic mankind bound to a (Catherine) wheel of destruction, in a city of the plain dominated by buildings shaped as cocks and a giant wheel.",Basic Instinct 2
62,kooleshwar,Another one in the long line of Bad Sequels. But...,4,20 April 2006,"We all know what they say about sequels and this movie is a prime example of the saying ""You cant have a sequel half as good as the First One"" and this case lets face it- the original though entertaining had its flaws as well.Needless to say I went into this movie expecting nothing more a few erotic moments (read as steamy scenes)peppered with a few genuinely sexually charged moments and some good chemistry between the hopefully hot Sharon stone and the other guy. This I daresay was not much at all and all in all besides this i expected quite a trashy movie.And trash is exactly what I got minus the few expectations i had from the movie. The chemistry was non existent , the scenes were trash and Sharon stone looked bad. Any person who went to the movie expecting what i did can safely just scroll down to the end of my review as the next part of the review is the unfortunate by product of having to see the movie as a normal movie and not a simple b-grade sequel.The acting in this movie is strictly OK. Sharon Stone's seduction and mind games parts border on hamming (and trust me a cosmetically and possible surgically enhanced 47 year old Sharon stone looks bad almost in every scene, her hair especially felt like it had gone through multiple treatments). David Morrissey displays no acting talent here. The only saving grace are the supporting cast who act out their brief roles comfortably and efficiently, special mention for David Thewlis who seems absolutely believable as the tough cop and Indira Varma who is thought was B-movie semi porn actress but who is actually much better than that ( sorry but ks was the only yardstick i had until now).The script of the film had looked like it could have had some potential but the shoddy acting and OK direction made sure we never saw any of it.The characters are all unidimensional and boring , even a child could see what Sharon's character is doing in the film yet we are to believe a trained psychologist can only stand and watch the ruining of his life. What bullocks.Not to mention the this movie does not benefit from ""The Scene"" from the first movie and save for one appropriate and disturbing scene in the film (which does not involve Sharon) the movies sex scenes all seem forced and badly executed.The only good part about the movie was the background score which added some excitement and tension to scenes which the actors were hamming to, there are a few scenes (mainly towards the beginning of the movie) that are likable and the background score plays a major part in that.But.............that said i didn't really get that bored in this movie and the only reason i can think off that is satisfied a burning curiosity in me, and having being satiated and realising i was right, i felt content once i left this movie.That being said the above reason is probably the only reason why you should be seeing this movie otherwise avoid it and see the Unrated DVD (which I'm sure is round the corner) instead.p.s I've changed the rating from 3 to 4 an back 2 times while writing this review",Basic Instinct 2

The only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not.Therefore, it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us! We NEVER EVER listen or read the critics. We only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us. Well enough about that.This movie is very good. not just good but very good.

Sure, Stone throws in a few ""camp moments"", but who cares, as she is Catherine Davis Tramell, weaving a story of intrigue and doom for whoever falls into her hands.London is a perfect location for the grown up Catherine, and the city reflects the new sophisticated evilness which she is weaving into another book of her deadly sins. The British cast, Charlotte Rampling and the handsome David Morrisey especially, provide the perfect moments in the film to send Stone/Tramell into her evil ways. The sets are so dark, reminded me of ASYLUM, and Stone perfectly matches the glamor of London.BASIC INSTINCT 2 will never be the first BASIC INSTINCT, and it shouldn't, as Catherine Tramell has moved on from Nick and pretty little San Francisco to something bigger-London, and with the ending, also reminded me of ASYLUM, you wonder if our Catherine is onto new and more deadly games.

66,lotekguy-1,sequels this bad usually go straight to video,2,1 April 2006,"Seldom has the decline from hit to sequel in a theatrical release been this severe. B.I. 2 is an awful movie (B.O. might be more accurate), coasting on fumes left over from the sizzling sensuality of the 1992 thriller that made Sharon Stone a star.First of all, Stone is absolutely not too old to reprise her femme fatale, Catherine Trammel. Though we don't see as much of her body this time, at 48 she's still got enough of the icy cool sexuality to toy with the men around her, despite their authority over her. It's the script that's flaccid, further sapped by British TV actor David Morrissey replacing Michael Douglas as the male lead. Douglas played a tormented cop, torn between convicting and bedding her; Morrissey's a tormented psychiatrist who can't tell whether she's a psychopath or the love of his life. The guy's such a stiff, one wonders how many wiser Clive-Owen wannabes read the script and declined. Morrissey's wife is Sigmund Freud's great-granddaughter, which apparently qualifies him more for the part than either his charisma or chemistry with Ms. Stone. He imbues this shrink with about the same emotional range as the office couch.In a sexy, but almost cartoonish, opening sequence, Stone drives a drugged-out dude around London for a high-speed thrill ride that ends in his death. Once again, the circumstances ominously match the plot of one of her novels. A detective (David Thewlis) seems hell-bent on convicting her, and brings in Morrissey for a medical opinion on how dangerous she may be to herself and others. The rest of the film involves more murders and another guessing game about whether Stone is the killer, someone else's front, or even a potential victim, while dredging up various devils and temptations of Dr. Dull.Everything about this story feels contrived, failing to create characters or a situation that stirs the emotions as the first one did. The original interrogation scene has become a film classic, even apart from Ms. Stone's controversial leg-crossing. Its analog here is so ill-conceived, director Michael Caton-Jones almost seems to have intended parody, rather than an homage.At one point Stone's Catherine asks the shrink who he thinks she's gonna kill next? In real life, her most obvious choices would be among the writers, director and her agent.",Basic Instinct 2

He deems her to be a risk addict, willing to do whatever it takes to feel a thrill and to have taken a risk. He starts seeing her on a regular basis as a client, and she reveals to him that she is aware of his past. Over a year ago, Michael had a patient who ended up killing his pregnant wife which has left him with a lot of guilt.A reporter, who is also sleeping with Michael's ex wife and Catherine, decides to write a negative article on him and his handling of the patient. The reporter eventually ends up dead, with viewers of course seeing that Trammel is the main suspect. Eventually, a few more people around Michael start dying as well which prompts the police to stop pointing the finger at Trammel and onto him. Will the truth come out, or will Dr. Glass be perfectly framed for a series of brutal killingsBasic Instinct 2 is such a let down after a wonderful original film. It just felt like an inferior film in pretty much every single category. A big flaw with Basic Instinct 2 is that Catherine has become an annoyance to the male protagonist and not a sexual being who is meant to ravished. She seems to follow around Michael like a lost puppy looking for a thrill or to take a risk, but it comes off like she is a nuisance. Stone and Morrissey lacked the chemistry that was there in the original with Michael Douglas for sure.Another flaw was the sex scenes and the sexual dialogue. I thought some of the stuff in the original was teetering on exploitative, but Basic Instinct 2 takes it to the ultimate cheap level. Catherine isn't as sleek and mysterious with her sexuality and sensuality. In this one, she simply says sexual words and phrases which is almost meant to turn Michael on and I guess shock the viewer. It failed to be impactful.I give Basic Instinct 2 credit and marks for keeping my attention with it's mystery, but it is an inferior film to the original product.

Didn't happen in the DVD version I got. The Poster lied. That was the first disappointment.The second one was the story itself and it would have been okay if I didn't realize that this was just a vehicle for Sharon Stone to put herself out there again. She played everything too flip and it became annoying, most annoying. The rest of the cast played it straight even with some terrible dialogue, but they couldn't keep up with her. This was her moment and she took advantage of it a little too much. She is a good actress, but why did she act this way is beyond me. After a while I realized that it didn't matter what the clues were as I no longer cared who did what to who (whom?) and who was blamed. Everything was so contrived nothing mattered. Twists were thrown in to really confuse the issue and they sure did that. So what was the point? There was no chemistry between Stone and Morrissey (Dr. Glass) and that hurt the story immensely and if Stone didn't play everything so flip that might have helped the story. You see, one person can make a difference and when that one person screws up everything comes apart in a NY minute.

Nevertheless, not so bad as some people would have us believe, and with a good (mostly British) cast in any event. In London novelist Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone once more) again gets suspected of homicide, after which she's evaluated by a successful psychiatrist (David Morissey) who falls under her sexy influence the same way the cop in the first film did (indicating how that plot ended and thus kinda spoiling its predecessor's open ending), after which he is drawn into London's erotic nightclub scene determining whether she's really an insane, sex hungry murderer, or whether he's slowly losing his own mind caught in her web of lies and sex. Despite good acting, very decent cinematography and editing and a fairly solid plot, this movie just lacks the punch of the previous movie: in fact, it would have been better if this was just a regular thriller with no actual story ties to Basic Instinct. Though Sharon Stone got a bit older, she still looks quite good naked, as she's demonstrating a bit more often than feels appropriately comfortable for the audience in this film's case.",Basic Instinct 2
72,pekinman,A car wreck,4,4 September 2006,"'Basic instinct 2' begins with a car wreck, and like car wrecks one always slows down to watch it. This is the kind of flick I don't pay to see in theatres anymore but it happened to be on pay-per-view last night at a friend's so I watched. I watched simply to see how Sharon Stone is doing these days after her stroke and plastic surgery. She LOOKS good I thought, still every inch the demonic succubus she was in Verhoeven's original 'Basic Instinct', though she's leaner and has a couple of new blemishes on her body. Some of her costumes were ill-advised but that's the fun of Sharon Stone. She wears stilettos like no one else since Joan Crawford.Stone holds the movie together single-handedly. The script is awful, the balance of the rather good cast is wasted and the plot a muddle. The writers have confused obfuscation with mystery. It is unclear at the end of this flick just WHO done it, but we know, or at least it seemed obvious to me who done it, and I knew it all along, though the so-called ""twist"" at the end attempted to cast doubts in the viewers' minds but it didn't fool me.The opening car wreck is ridiculous, as a car hitting the Thames at 95mph isn't just going to going to go ""splash"" and float to the bottom all of a piece, it's going to crunch. Hitting water is just as devastating to a vehicle, and its passengers, as it is hitting solid groundBut we get to see Sharon and her lover sitting placidly under water, not a scratch on them, or the car, sinking peacefully to the bottom. It was then that I knew what I was in for so I put myself into fantasy-gear and let this turkey gobble. Having done that I could enjoy Sharon as Sharon. No one does intelligent sluts like she can and she certainly has more charisma and energy than most of the other stars being featured in Hollywood flicks these days.Michael Caton-Jones is a seasoned director when it comes to flashy trash. His best work is 'Scandal' from 1989 with Joanne Whalley-Kilmer and John Hurt (as well as Bridget Fonda who is splendid as Mandy Rice-Davies and alone worth the price of admission). But Caton-Jones is saddled with this stupid script in 'Basic Instinct 2' and can't do a thing with it. The highlight of 'Basic Instinct 2' is the cinematography and interiors, though the latter are a bit old-hat these days. I'm tired of multi-million dollar urban hotel lobbies masquerading as luxury flats. But the coldness of the settings suits the coldness of the characters. The sleazy bits in the sex-streets of London are reminiscent of a back-lot. They don't ""smell"" as Verhoeven would have made them do. All in line with Stone's ""dirty Barbie"" portrayal, but it's fun when she's on screen and does her orgasm thing.Her leading man is not an entire failure. David Morrissey is a very good actor and suits the role of the (possibly) psycho analyst. His whey-face and hunky body make for an interesting combination. The great Charlotte Rampling is utterly wasted but I hope she made a lot of money and will continue to act for many years to come, taking over Maggie Smith's lot in life as various goofy old ladies in blockbusters. David Thewlis is also wasted although his role is more faceted than the others, aside from Stone's but he resorts to over-acting to try to make something out of very little.The panoramic shots of London that knit the various scenes together are evocative but there are so many panoramic shots of London between the many scenes that they become rather a bore in the end. And the parts of the city that are filmed from above look more like Houston or Denver or any other U.S. city financial center that has popped up in the last 25 years.So, if you are ""in"" to car-wreck movies, in every sense of the word, get a bottle (or 2, or 3) and settle back and let your left brain doze for two hours. This sequel to 'Basic Instinct' has none of the original's assets so don't expect much, but it's sort of fun, until the last half hour when I began to wish it would end, which it does with that terribly lame ""twist"". It wasn't as bad as I expected it to be, and if you are ashamedly (or more importantly unashamedly) fascinated by the career of Sharon Stone this movie is essential viewing.",Basic Instinct 2

Granted its not an Oscar type film nor should it be reviewed as such but it sure delivers the punches. It was extremely entertaining. The storyline was very good and it made a very interesting thriller and whodonnit. Sharon Stone in her ripe age of 48?-50, looks exquisite and Davide Morissey...well let's say the sex scenes were very,very, very hot!!! I highly recommend this movie for its a very entertaining film. I saw this film at midnight when I usually fall asleep in films but this one was good. Yes, it may be corky here or there but overall I give it a ten. Don't listen to the critics and see this one for yourself!!! it is good. As a sequel, I found it to be very original and was able to stand on its own. It's not that BI1 was better, is that BI2 is just plain different. Same concept but different development. I look forwardt o see more of David Morrisey in other film because he is very talented.",Basic Instinct 2
76,lhhung_himself,Made me appreciate the original...,4,7 November 2007,"I used to think that Basic Instinct was a pretty empty movie, more famous for that one scene than anything else. After finally sitting through the entire movie (I had previously only seen er.. snatches) the original is actually quite a decent thriller. The plot is just plausible enough and Verhoeven clever enough to keep that sense of suspense and tension all the way through the film.In Basic Instinct 2, Sharon Stone still looks great, and the performances were pretty good overall, arguably better than in the first film, especially that of Thewlis. The problem is that we already know what the main character is like so there is no longer any suspense there. This means that there is much greater emphasis on the plot - we have to believe that Stone's adversary could buy her version of the story without being a complete idiot. Unfortunately the plot is very weak and predictable - with a climactic scene which is simply not believable. So when the denouement comes at the end where everything is explained, it's a big yawn since it was all pretty obvious and not very plausible.",Basic Instinct 2
77,samuelding85,"Beyond Excitement, Filled with Disappointment",3,8 July 2006,"Mabey producer Mario F. Kassar should not have made the decision of bringing a sequel to the 1992 best selling erotic classic, and Sharon Stone should not have picked up the role of the author who uses psychological tactics to lure her victim into her trap.Basic Instinct 2 is due far too long from the prequel, which not only makes the audience lost the excitement and anticipation, but also puts Sharon Stone at a disadvantage of baring nude at 48 years old. Her charm from Basic Instinct was lost, and what the audience get was a old actress trying to resurrect her fame by taking up Basic Instinct 2.While Michael Caton Jones try to direct Basic Instinct 2 close to the same way as Paul Verhoeven, it seems to be a total disaster when the final piece of work was presented to the public. Cheesy and lengthy dialogue wrecks the film. The lack of chemistry between Stone and David Morrissey makes Basic Instinct 2 a crappy production which was hastily made instead of a sequel that guarantees to thrill the audience with new excitement. Somehow, Jones seems to be unable to bring the chemistry out of Stone and Morrissey, compared to Stone with Michael Douglas in Basic Instinct.Basic Instinct 2 follows everything from Basic Instinct: Catherine Tramell kills a man, investigation conducted, she try to control the man who wants to control her, and makes sure that he will fall into her trap which was written in her novels. Though there are thrills in Basic Instinct 2, it lacks the kick and the suspense it should had in Basic Instinct. Also, no excitement from Basic Instinct was seen in the sequel.Perhaps it is time for Tramell to call for an end with her menace on man manipulating in Basic Instinct 2.",Basic Instinct 2

It's what most men, including Englishmen of colour, wanted to do with the Sharon Stone of Basic Instinct and 'Sliver'. Relocating the film to London instead of San Francisco shows what a huge following the original film had in the UK. However, this film does not live up to the original. For a start, Sharon Stone is too old and way passed her best. In the original, not only was she sexy but she was a good actress. In this film she looks plain and washed out. She had no presence or anything going on her face to advance the story. She was soulless, but then so was David Morrisey. I didn't connect with any of the characters, although some of the ideas could have been handled better.This film shouldn't have been made and does not deserve to see the light of day.",Basic Instinct 2

Towards everything gets back on fast forward and suddenly everything happens so fast that you are left wondering if David Thewlis was right all along... ""This one is for the mind f***ers""... There is nothing right in the movie. For starters, the plot stinks, the acting stinks, Sharon Stone the prime attraction of the movie, isn't even a quarter of what she was in BI-1.

80,walken_on_sunshine,Not Unbearable But Boring and Anti Climatic,4,3 March 2007,"No Basic Instinct 2 is not the monstrously unbearable film it's been made out to be personally i believe that this movie has received low ratings because it didn't top the original and because it starred Sharon Stone whose movies may be Razzie worthy but whose performances are never Razzie worthy.Basic Instinct 2 follows novelist Catherine tramell being questioned for the murder of a soccer star and going through psychiatric treatment on her own terms, Catherine soon plays a seductive game with her psychiatrist getting him into loads of trouble.I'm just going to go out and say that no this film does not live up to the original and no it's not that great of a movie in general but this movie needs to stop taking it up the @$$ from a bunch of p*ssed off fanboys or people who expect everything to be an original motion picture that will leave them breathless.Basic Instinct 2 has a pretty interesting plot but the pacing is so horrible you lose interest very fast but there is always a scene that brings back your intrigue and keeps you wanting to watch.The character of Catherine Tramell is played flawlessly by the still sexy Sharon Stone who gives a performance full of greed,sex,seduction,insanity,intelligence, and just pure evil.The look in Sharon's eyes during this movie is that of a snake sneaking up on it's prey, knowing it's prey's every move, waiting to strike when the time is right.The rest of the cast gives very ho hum boring performances and while the entire cast is believable as their characters there nearly expressionless faces just end up giving you the want for more Catherine Tramell.Like the first film there is a lot of explicit sex and Sharon stone shows her still magnificent body off in sex scenes that appear to be just full of violence and aggression.The movie is very slow moving and doesn't promise the kind of film the opening sequence leads it on to be.At the beginning you get this very pulp noir film but soon it just turns to a film about psychiatry with boring lighting and boring visual effects.A lot of the dialogue can't be heard over the very overbearing background noise that drowns out the actors voices.The dialogue is brilliantly dirty and definitely intelligent and original, Sharon Stones line delivery is perfect and hauntingly beautiful as is her character.Overall this is a very boring, silly, movie but with good acting and fantastic dialogue yes it is a pretty bad film but not to the degree that people have brought it to.Sharon Stone and the writers of this movie deserve better than to be viewed as making one of the worst movies ever made.Overall a so so movie that is enjoyable because of Sharon Stone's performance.",Basic Instinct 2

The totally plastic and scrawny old Sharon Stone just ISN'T sexy, her creaky attempts to BE sexy are quite sad. Appalling dialogue, an incoherent plot and dreadful acting make this a prize turkey. I'm not sure who carries off the honours for worst performance, but the ghastly David Thewliss must come close. This man is one of the most over rated actors in the UK and this example proves it. David Morrissey just isn't big screen material (he's fine on TV). As for Charlotte Rampling, what the hell were you thinking of girl - to take part in this garbage?

Of course the acting wasn't any good, and the story line was boring because there was, basically no story line, no sequence, no hope or fear for the actors, no audience involvement, except for laughing at moments when the filmmakers didn't want you to laugh.

The script is good... and you never really have the ""complete"" truth, even at the end of the film.Supporting cast is good, too, with a good Willem Dafoe, Charlotte Rampling and David Morrissey.

But here's a little taste: in the opening sequence, under the influence of some drug Sharon Stone's character drives through deserted central London streets (!) at 110 mph (!) at night while masturbating and french kissing her boyfriend in the passenger's seat. After crashing into the Thames, in the nicely lit water she manages to give her boyfriend another kiss before getting out and floating away while boyfriend drowns... and then the police think all that is quite OK under the law. Sharon Stone's quotes in the advertising for the movie here suggested that there would be plenty of erotic action but it doesn't deliver much that satisfies on that count. Where the film does have a modicum of merit is its surreal ambiance throughout and its exploration of the suggestion that some psychiatrists may be as screwed up as some of the people they treat.",Basic Instinct 2

93,ascheland,Stone Walks Away with a Movie No One in her Right Mind Would Want,5,30 December 2016,"The primary reasons for seeing ""Basic Instinct 2"" are to find out if it's as bad as people say it is and Sharon Stone. Concerning its reputed badness, I have to say ""BI2"" wasn't nearly as awful as I was expecting, which was a disappointment in itself. Whereas the predecessor gleefully catered to the audience's baser instincts, the sequel tries to pass itself off as a sophisticated psychological thriller, director Michael Caton-Jones doing his best smother the movie's camp potential beneath a blue-tinted English chill. Fortunately, Sharon Stone cannot be so easily tamed. Having spent much of her career trying to grow as an actress, playing moms and cuckolded wives and death row inmates (yet only getting an Oscar nomination when she played a hooker in ""Casino""), Stone, approaching 50 at the time this was made, sets out to prove she's still a sexpot. I'm sure many people would've wished she'd just posed for Playboy instead, but Stone is almost single-handedly responsible for ""BI2""'s entertainment value. True, she looks a bit haggard throughout much of the movie, but given her character's fondness for excess – so much so it's a wonder the woman has time to write a grocery list, let alone a trashy potboiler – one should expect her to look a bit rough. Smirking like she's in on the joke, Stone takes over every scene she's in, walking away with a movie no one in her right mind would want. I still hold out hope that there's a trashy prime time soap in the works that has an evil temptress part with Stone's name on it. Just like Joan Collins did in the 1980s and Heather Locklear did in the 1990s, Stone could quite easily revive her flagging career by becoming the prime time vixen of the 2000s.

It's not ALL about sex, but also about taking time to develop the story. Worst screenplay, my a**""Basic Instinct 2"" won a Razzie Award for ""worst prequel or sequel"". HA! Now that is indeed a lie.

95,rajah524-3,"Over the Top, but Consistent with Stone's Career Path",5,31 May 2008,"The DVD is out and I have seen it. We get more murk, more nukid Sharon (which is neither altogether bad nor altogether good at this age), and more confusion. My main problem is that the (Scottish?) brogues here are so thick that it's very hard to grasp the dialog. But even if one could understand what was being said, there are other problems here, as well.BI Two purports to be a psychological thriller and then represents three experienced mental health professionals and a veteran detective who would (in real life) be far more likely to understand a vengeful female sociopath for serial-molested adult child she probably is. In the real world, such women -are- well-understood, and handling them appropriately would -still-, I expect, make a pretty interesting movie. This is unfortunate, because women (at least somewhat) like Catherine really do exist. And they -will- use their physical and intellectual gifts to serve their need to get back at the world for what it did to them when they were little. Eszterhas and Verhoeven managed to keep the very bizarre impulsivities one sees with intellectually gifted, sociopathic borderlines on a nice, tight leash in BI One. The dog simply runs amok here. Was Stone's financial control over the film the reason? At least to some, many of her role choices suggest an over-identification with an angry abused child fixated on castrating powerful males (e.g.: Lori in ""Total Recall,"" Ginger in ""Casino,"" Ellen in the ""Quick and the Dead""). In whatever event, the intriguing character of Catherine Trammel that emerged in BI One is overcooked here. And that's a shame, because the revenge-bent Jezebel who's empowered by a decadent society to use all her ""tools"" to grind up those around her -is- worth having a look at. And, whatever her reasons may be, Stone has given us a bunch of excellent examples over the years. In this case, she just overshoots the target.That said, the forensically oriented viewer (say, the fan of ""Law and Order: Criminal Intent"" of the D'Onfrio/Erbe era; or those into Michael Stone, Robert Hare, Reid Meloy or Teddy Millon) will see a lot of ""character"" here in yet another of Stone's -august- depictions of female psychopathology.

You need to understand this because Shannen Doherty makes a great Catherine Tramel because she is the Beverly Hill 90210 bad woman. Laura Dern and Bridget Fonda are younger that Sharon Stone because they should be in the Basic Instinct sequel.

This one has a good thriller story and it would have worked without Catherine Trammel and the Basic Instinct title which drags down the expectations and makes it seem cheap. The best thing with the film are the supporting characters. David Morrissey is excellent as are David Thewlis and Charlotte Rampling (she was the reason I saw it at all). Rampling could have done something as Catherine. Sharon Stone walks around like a blonde ghost in high heels. She's too much of a cliché - she wears party dresses to her shrink! I liked that it took place in London and not in some enormous faceless American city as is the usual in thrillers. The ending, *SPOILER*, drags down the story and makes it ridiculous. Even if the writers would have kept it as it was they could just have had Catherine tell it to Michael instead of the lame flashbacks showing it all.

98,maatmouse-1,Basic Instinct 2 - the question is why?,5,31 August 2006,"The original Basic Instinct was basically (yawn) a vehicle for Dutch director Paul Verhoeven to peddle his idea of what an adult whodunnit movie was supposed to be. Instead, it turned into a voyeur's treat for fans of Sharon Stone and gave her a certain degree of notoriety. It did little for Michael Douglas's career, other than condemning him to a lifetime of being analysed by what film roles he decided to do. Douglas has never been one to be afraid of taking risks, but BI 1 was an exploitative film which could have been so much better if half the sex had been taken out.Basic Instinct 2 fares little better, regrettably. Relocated to London for reasons never fully explained and shifting the focus of Tramell's 'dangerous' obsession to a psychiatrist/doctor, Sharon Stone once again manages to both appal and bore us all in the same sitting. Sure, she looks very pretty and is extremely well dressed but there is a hard, cold edge to the character that wasn't there before. Becoming little more than a bored thrill seeker, Tramell manages to kill her first victim in her car after some frankly daft driving and then proceeds to drag the film along by taunting her victim Dr Michael Glass, played with little life by David Morrissey. Did she kill Adam Tower (Hugh Dancy)? Did she kill Denise Glass? Did she kill some male prostitute in a seedy Soho brothel after screwing him? An endless and frankly boring plot about Dr Glass's guilt over some other murderer who may or may not have beem guilty clouds the film's narrative and should have been resolved and dumped early on, but drags throughout the film and constant references to Tramell's drug taking are never really explained. Charlotte Rampling, playing Glass's colleague, is completely underused and remains a kind of side plot to tantalise us over the whole 'is she a lesbian?' issue.All in all, a reasonable film but don't watch if you're expecting something good and beware of explicit language and some nasty sex.",Basic Instinct 2

101,martijn-56,Good movie! Do not believe the bad reviews! Read this one!,9,30 October 2006,"I have to say that this was an excellent thriller! I cannot believe the bad reviews I read about this one! Maybe it is because people expect something exactly the same for a sequel. Well, this one is partly a blast from the past, and partly an independent movie from the first, as it should be. The strong points of the first one were of course that at the time explicit sex, and language alluding to it was new. Now it is harder to shock without getting vulgar. I think the sex in this movie is more shocking than in Monsters ball, and still has a point for the plot (that is, Katherine manipulating her characters). The Hitchcock style filming of wide sweeping coastal scenery was another strong point of the first, but is compensated by the slick looks of the more classy English atmosphere in Londen. Both movies had excellent dialogues, and left the story open for multiple twists. I think this one is even better with that: did Katherine do it, the doctor, or the cop? They all had motive and opportunity. Of course, her expressions leave little clues about the probability it must have been her all along, but...The only BUT this movie would have is it did not have a knockout scene like the famous one with Katherine not having her underpants on. That indeed is hard, impossible,to beat. But the point is, was this a good movie in itself? I think it was very good. Good dialogues, good setting, good plot, and good acting. I think Sharon Stone did well with choosing an English cast. English are known for not showing their emotions, or even having problems dealing with it. This charged the movie up. I don't know how I will look when I am 48, but for her age, Sharon Stone looked GREAT in this one and showed once again she is a hell of an actress! Highly recommended!",Basic Instinct 2

This movie isn't that bad at all, and I hated the first one (except for that scene, of course). Now, it's easy to trash the movie without seeing it, just because of the exploitation of the first one. But even though this is no masterpiece either - the first half of the film fits into the stereotype very well - the second half is truly engaging, and does keep you guessing, as hard to believe as that may be. Really, I kept wondering till the end, and that's a hard feat to achieve. I have lost my respect for the Razzies Award because of this movie. Now I know the guy just wants the media attention and will stoop to kicking a 48-year-old (still beautiful) woman just to get his one day of fame.",Basic Instinct 2
103,TruPretender,The heck with Capote and Johnny Cash- this is Catherine Tramells' movie!,9,9 April 2006,"Finally, after years of awaiting a new film to continue the sexual mayhem of ""Basic Instinct"", we have been given a great sequel that is packed with the right elements needed for a franchise such as this! I remember everything about the original, the steam, the romance, the sex, the interrogation, the music (by the master Jerry Goldsmith), and everything else from violence and murder, to intense confrontations of all kind! Make no mistake, ""Basic Instinct"" was a real winner for audiences everywhere. I can remember in 2001 when we were first given the news about such a sequel. Five years later, we have it. I never would have thought it to end up such as this. When it was declared a dropped project, time sure couldn't tell if it was ever a real possibility to begin with. Well, I guess we now know anything's possible in this case. Even if the original director, or writer are not present, all we need is the glamorous, always reliable Sharon Stone, and we have a done deal! Please, hear me out...When people say that this film is bad, I think it is only due to the fact that the style is extreme, and slightly dated. I use the word ""dated"" only because we have not seen a certain film of the like in many years, and audiences have become adapted to the pointless, boring storytelling seen in other movies that actually make money, and the only reason they make such big numbers is because those films are family friendly. Who needs hole some and clean? Of course it's a pleasant thing to have, but c'mon! Escapism is really seldom these days, and ""Basic Instinct 2"" gives us real fans what we've been expecting. This film is not an Academy Award winner, nor does it try to be. It simply delivers the die-hard fans what they have been expecting. It's a film for fun. Movies today seem to take themselves way too seriously, but this film is just loose and fun, not taking itself seriously, not too seriously anyway. That said, I shall evaluate the film.The film is a fast-paced film from the first second, as we see Cathernine Tremell in a car, speeding at 110 MPH-and enjoying lustful thrills doing so. Perhaps sex and driving does not mix, because our sexy novelist takes a bad turn and...well, she gets away unharmed, but her studly partner doesn't fare too well. Once again, Tremell is the primary suspect of the accident, and will be put under analyst's and psychiatrists. Dr. Michael Glass (Morrissey) is automatically drawn to to her from the first moment he meets her. Like another criminal investigator before him, he is entranced and seduced, slowly, and surely. His denial of it all begins to crumble around him as she weaves a spell only she has the power to do. Tramell is possibly more dangerous now, than she was before,but like the first one, we'll never really know, will we? Once the seduction is in motion, jealousy, rage, drugs, and a plateful of erotic scenery ensues!This film does not recycle the first one, but rather mentions the previous films incidents briefly from time to time. This is a good thing. It lets us as an audience know that the script has been written to bring the level up a notch or two. Sharon Stone dazzles us again, as though 14 years has not come to pass. Her second run of the deceitful novelist is right on the spot as earlier. Just awesome! David Morrissey is well cast, and manages pretty well. The fact that a non-popular star was chosen, makes his performance all the more enjoyable because we as an audience have no background on him, just what we see him perform. My final thought-8.5 to 9 out of 10. So it's not the first one, nor can it live up to the first ones prize winning place. It can, however, live up to the standards set by the first film, and it does folks! It does.",Basic Instinct 2
104,Tecun_Uman,Brilliant screenplay and stellar acting make for a home-run,10,13 April 2006,"You really have to question the release date of this movie. Traditionally Oscar has not been friendly to such an early release. A late fall release of this epic would have meant two things, a blockbuster bonanza at the box office and more Academy nominations than Hercules could carry. However, some dunce in Hollyweird decided to run with it now and I will tell you why. Certain movies get a buzz. Producers start watching the dailies and cannot contain themselves, they want to get it out there as soon as possible. Before you know it, the studio is screaming, ""get this piece of gold out there!"" Well, who could blame them. This film rotates around the sun that is Sharon Stone. Whose Sharon Stone? She is Charlize Theron, with more acting chops. In this movie, Stone is not simply acting, she is grabbing the moviegoer by the throat and screaming ""watch me!"" And do we ever watch. We are captivated by a master thespian at the top of her game. Sometimes seductive, sometimes lurid, and always dangerous, meow! In all my years, I can think of only one other sequel that was so vastly superior to the original film and that was Jaws II. However, history repeats with a mighty cha-ching in Basic Instinct II. What is my instinct, my instinct is Basic Instinct III and IV are already in the works. Like a Barry Bonds swing, Sharon Stone has hit another home-run, and no longer has to rest her laurels on the great gunfighter movie she made with Gene Hackman and Russel Crowe. Ms. Stone, I and your country thank you.",Basic Instinct 2
105,kayabay,not as terrible as mentioned... entertaining too...,8,30 August 2006,"Well if this was not a sequel and a totally different movie even may be without Sharon Stone, who would have blamed everyone for being lame ? The story is good actually...The casting is good too... A 47 year old Sharon Stone is STILL Sharon Stone, and she's a professional. And she's still beautiful too no matter what aesthetic surgery or other methods, look around you, how many 47 year old women you know who have kept herself in good figure ? The exciting thing is also we see a London with a different angle of view, not some classic American look to it.David Morrisey is a good choice too. He's acting calm & British...Michael Caton-Jones has also done a perfect job, the tempo gets slow and gets fast but never let you loose the concentration.Isn't it too easy to blame all people who put their best efforts with a few words and get along ? I've seen many worse movies that people gather around and applause.You won't waste your almost 2 hours for nothing ! PS. On the ratings, I see many people quoted ""1"" on this movie. Is this a joke ? Or are there too many 45-50 year old women who doesn't feel good watching Ms.Stone and having tears :)",Basic Instinct 2
106,gorgonite,Shazza Does London,10,14 February 2011,"Basic Instinct 2 is essentially a vehicle for Sharon Stone to reprise her infamous role as Catherine Tramell. Tramell is now an even more intelligent, controlled, menacing, mature character and just as sexually deviant as before. Stone obliges with a better performance than Basic Instinct 1.The original film had an over the top style stamped upon it by Verhoeven. This film has a subtler almost film noir style and is shot in London. The music score from the original is referenced and gives the film a genuine feel of the sequel. The tongue in cheek humour from the original is also retained and given some British spin!Basic Instinct 2 uses a very similar structure to Basic Instinct and as such is not original. This however is no bad thing as everything that was enjoyable before is also enjoyable here with an added twist. For example instead of Shooter there is Glass, and instead of Beth there is Washburn. This film is an ambiguous, twisting, slightly thrilling, whodunit. Only the suspense and controversy from the original film seem to be lacking.David Morrisey plays Dr Glass who is a stiff upper lipped, control freak, psychiatric consultant and is assigned by London's Police to evaluate Tramell. Tramell keeps throwing bait at Glass who keeps biting until subsequently losing control and turning into Tramell's puppet. David Thewlis plays corrupt London detective Washburn who is determined to convict Tramell.Two slight drawbacks of the film consist of weaknesses in the characters of Dr Glass and Detective Washburn. Glass initially appears as a strong willed professional, but then seems to involve himself in a game he doesn't control and turns into an adolescent stalker! Everyone knows that London Met Police don't do corruption. Now if Tramell had parked her Spyder on a yellow instead of Docklands, or demonstrated in the G20 I'm sure Washburn would have interrogated her for a few days, and arrested her for smoking.Pros - Catherine Tramell, Humour, LondonCons - Glass and WashburnOverall - Duck Of The Century!The humour in this film was great. The beginning with footballer Franks dogging at 100mph with Tramell. Stan is definitely the man.Also Tramell in Soho, cocking her leg and flashing her ... well soliciting 'Dickie Pep' (lol) and offering him cash!!!!!******************************************************* ******************************************************Here's my take on who was responsible for the murders in the movie.Cheslov's wife was most likely murdered by Cheslov who was involved with drugs. It's suggested that Washburn did it due to corruption however this scenario seems less likely.Franks - accidentally on purposeTramell is likely to have befriended, manipulated and murdered Towers. Tramell indirectly tells Glass of the intention beforehand. Her Big Ben lighter was left at the crime scene for Glass. She also admitted the murder later.Denise - Tramell most likely arranged this in order to have an alibi. No-one else would have a motive for this. Tramell subsequently frees Glass on a technicality.Pep - The style of the execution coupled with the risk addiction would imply Tramell arranged it. Washburn planted the bottle and syringe at the scene!Washburn - Tramell set it up in a similar manner to Basic Instinct 1. Glass trying to prevent a murder before it happens ended up setting himself up.",Basic Instinct 2
107,surfandski,"Sharon you sex goddess, you rule !",7,28 June 2007,"I could not agree more with the fact that people ARE indeed to get this movie just because of their dislike for what they perceive to be a cocky actress full of herself. But if a guy behaves like her (hey JaaAck) they cheer him on. Well Sharon you have a new fan honey. Oh sure some of her movies have been crap, but have you watch anything from DeNiro lately, the only thing left for him to be is in a dog food commercial, plueeeeeese ! Sharon Stone rules the screen on this one, and her male counterpart is also very good. I have never seen this guy on anything before and I was pleasantly surprised. From the opening scene this movie rocks, and entertains the pants off you...almost literally. There is a good plot about who the possible killers might be, but of course you know who the killer is, you have to be dumb not to (so no this is not a spoiler), but it is the doubt that she puts in her psychiatrist mind that is the backbone of the movie, and as far as he is concerned, it COULD be someone else. Now yes, 1 minute before one of the main characters is killed you are like, OK wake up dude, you can't be this dumb, but I am willing to overlook that little factor because the movie has delivered so much fun all the way up to that point without breaking pace. The production is excellent, and like someone mentioned before, the photograph of the buildings of London are beautiful, it makes you realize how uninteresting American cities really are. So stop beating this movie up just because you personally don't like Sharon Stone, there is a LOT to like. You watch !",Basic Instinct 2
108,SonOfMoog,The Face of Evil,6,20 July 2007,"I have looked into the face of evil. She is a woman, and her name is Catherine Trammell (pronounced Tra-MELL). I'll be quoting a lot from other critics here, because I found reading their reviews, they said what I thought better than I could.First, though, before we go any further, please know that whatever you think of Sharon Stone, or this movie, this is a first rate murder mystery. It is set in London and all the players except Sharon Stone are English .. and, as I watched, I couldn't help thinking this would have been a terrific episode of Mystery! on PBS.The movie like the psychotic Catherine Tra-MELL, draws you in. At first, you think it's obvious what's going on; then, you're not so sure; then you're sure, and angry at all these stupid people for falling for Catherine's schemes; then, at the end, you're not sure again .. On that level, this movie works.But, this movie is not at its most .. well, basic .. a mystery. It is a character study of Tra-MELL, and the actress who plays her, and as such, it does not succeed quite as well.Roger Ebert gives us the first clue to unlocking the mystery of Trammell and Stone: ""The Catherine Tramell role cannot be played well, but Sharon Stone can play it badly better than any other actress alive .. "" Chris Hewitt delivers another: ""Stone, who never raises her voice above a bedroom purr, plays Catherine like she doesn't give a ""research"" if anyone thinks she's ridiculous. She knows ""Basic Instinct 2"" is a comedy, and she is the only one in on the joke."" This is critical. You buy this, you buy the movie. If you don't, then BI 2 becomes a farce, not a comedy or a murder mystery. Trammell is in a world of her own, and Stone creates that world first in Trammell's own head, then in the shrink's who sees her for what she is and is taken in anyway, then .. in ours.Owen Glieberman tells us how Catherine weaves her spell: ""What counted wasn't the words but the subtext Stone brought to them, her persistent toying glimmer of You know you want to f--- me. Everything else was just talk."" This movie is all about subtext. The sexual tension builds .. and builds, and while there is release for some of the characters, usually in death, there is none for us. ""It's a treat, "" Glieberman says, ""to see Stone rev her evil vixen engine again .. "" Indeed.Stone is still a strikingly beautiful woman (and so is Charlotte Rampling who costars, but I digress), and if she were not, the audience wouldn't buy into her character, nor would we believe what we were seeing when the psychiatrist who is treating her, falls under her spell.The mechanism of seduction was absolutely perfect, down to the smallest detail. Trammell meticulously schemes to seduce her therapist, every line she speaks in session a ploy to arouse his libido .. And, as soon as he shows an interest, she secures the hook in his mouth .. and disappears. ""I'm canceling therapy,"" she says at one point, and briefly drops out of his life. He's hooked.What is most interesting here is we are not. The psychiatrist who is her foil, her mark, her lover, her boy-toy, and at some moments her enemy .. begins to unravel before our eyes, and it is here where this movie lost me. His helplessness did not ring true.So, we've come to the end of our Catherine Trammell character study, and it is time to summarize. Is she a serial killer or is she not? The movie does not say, so we are left to decide for ourselves.But, Roger Ebert and Director Michael Caton-Jones provide the most important insight into her character, when Ebert says of the director: ""he alternates smoldering closeups with towering dominatrix poses"" Catherine Trammell stands revealed at last: a garden variety dominatrix, whose entire life consists of playing head games with everyone she meets. And, she is very good. Her psychiatrist early on says that she has an ""omnipotence"" fixation, and we don't understand that at first. By the end of this movie, we know exactly what it means: she is, indeed, the dominatrix, working every circumstance, every emotion, every lapse in judgment into an intricate tapestry of evil in service to her own ends.I liked Basic Instinct 2. Not a lot, but more than the 15 or 16 other people who saw it .. Call it a guilty pleasure.",Basic Instinct 2
109,EyeoftheBeholder1,"Had it come out in '98, it could have been received better.",6,18 June 2010,"This film in my opinion gets a critical beat down more than it deserves. It is indeed highly underrated. They definitely should not have called it Basic Instinct 2. Just 'risk addiction' would have been fine. For example, 'hannibal', was not called 'silence of the lambs 2' thankfully, but still it was a worthy sequel. Besides that, the script should have recognized that Katherine Tramell is quite older now, and should have laid off the sexual themes which were dramatically overplayed, especially in the opening sequence. True, Stone did look great, but it just felt wrong and forced. Tramell is a calculating, brilliant killer/sociopath and she does not need to rely just on looks to get what she wants done. The story besides the mentioned flaws above, is actually good. Morissey was enjoyable as the male lead and held his own against Stone. But the unrealistic opening sequence, Stone's age, and forced sexual dialogue are the negatives that far outweigh the positives. Unfortunately, this sequel came out quite too late. If released in '98, I believe it would have done better at the box office. Perhaps even Verhoeven would have been on board. Sequels should definitely come out within a 3-4 year range of their predecessor, if it can't for whichever reason, then a new name should be given, for example 'risk addiction'. Watch this if you're a fan of the original, it does certainly have some good moments, and the Oscar nominated Stone does give it her all. But I think it's safe to say you'll agree with most of what I have said.",Basic Instinct 2
110,fuadkhan2002,Better than the original!,7,21 June 2015,"In all honesty, I found this sequel to have much more substance and brains than the sleazy original pop cult classic. Where the first Basic Instinct was loud, brash, gaudy and gratuitous, this one is subtle, dark, intellectual, imaginative and cerebral. The plot, storyline, and Sharon Stone herself, have all matured for the better. Gone is the bad 90s psycho nympho girl called Catherine Tramell and in comes the highly intelligent, manipulative, calm and confident older Tramell. She plays a deadly cat and mouse game with her male psychiatrist to the point where he is unable to differentiate between fact and fantasy. Her acting has matured considerably over the years and she exhibits a highly understated, subtle acting style and exudes just the right mix of seduction and threat, the perfect femme fatale. David Morrissey does great with his British accent and sensibility as the psychiatrist contrasted with Michael Douglas' boorish Nick Curran. Stone has maintained her enviable figure over the years and only looks better physically and psychologically to play the role. I highly recommend this movie to all the fans of the erotic thriller genre that was so chic in the 90s.",Basic Instinct 2
111,crukeg,An interesting thrilller,7,10 February 2007,"Yes i'll say before i start commenting, this movie is incredibly underrated.Sharon Stone is great in her role of Catherine Trammell as is Morrissey as Dr glass. He is an analyst sent in to evaluate her after the death of a sports star. Glass is drawn into a seductive game that Trammel uses to manipulate his mind.The acting was good (apart from Thewlis)Stone really has a talent with this role. She's slick, naughty and seductive and doesn't look a day older than she did in the first.She really impressed me(like in Casino). Morrisey was also good. He showed much vunerablitity in a role that needed it. Thewlis however was lame. He ruined his character and was over-the-top the whole way. He really sucked.Overall, this movie not as good the first but Stone is a hoot to watch. Just ignore Thewlis.",Basic Instinct 2
112,mhthehammer,Lame sequel,3,28 May 2020,"Lethal weapon Catherine Tramell is back with a sequel to the 1992 hit noir film Basic Instinct. Years later, the sexy blonde viper (Sharon Stone) lands in London where she pays daily visits to Dr. Michael Glass (David Morrissey) and once again plays a series of mind tricks with him. Dr. Glass is left with conflict between having sexual relations with her and arresting her for the murders of Adam Towers (Hugh Dancy), Denise (Indira Varma), and Roy Washburn (David Thewlis). Despite having the similar plot, this movie holds accountable for some of the silliest moments in the series. Unlike the previous film where she mostly used an ice pick to murder her victims, in Basic Instinct 2, Catherine drives over 100 mph in a car with Kevin (Stan Collymore) masturbating her and drowns the car into the Thames. This over-the-top murder method might fit more in a parody of the first movie and makes her seem like a sleazy B-movie villain. Furthermore, how nobody in Scotland Yard can be immediately suspicious about her and arrest her after she killed Kevin is anybody's case. Even the ending was a bit cheap and hokey, with Dr. Glass getting arrested and taken to a mental ward. Instead of killing him like she did in the last film, she leaves him her bestseller and some more predatory manipulation. Basic Instinct 2 is nothing more than a lame sequel with very little suspense and not much erotic undercurrent. (1 ½ Chinese Dominatrices out of 5)",Basic Instinct 2

For Ms. Sharon Stone being 50 she looks like she did when the first BASIC INSTINCT was made.Its an entertaining little guilty pleasure of mine with some super sexy scenes and a fun trashy little mystery. What I like about this movie is you never really know who the killer is...and the ending leaves it open to the viewer! The story line is similar to the first film... but for some odd reason I like this film better. It starts out with a super action packed sexy scene and ends with a dramatic triumphant ending.

Thewlis is great.,1,11 September 2006,"The best thing about this film was seeing how a talented actor like David Thewlis work around crappy, corny writing to produce an entertaining, noteworthy performance. Sharon Stones' portrayal of Catherine Tramell is very outdated and calculated. Her plastic surgery disasters are so prominent, it distracts from the character and the story. The plot goes from uninspired cheese to predictable cliché. The cinematography is decent and the intention OK, but ultimately worthless. That being said, the overall tone is, at best Noir, at worst, typical Hollywood nonsense. The scene when he sees her getting it on with some guy from the rooftop is beyond bad, into worse than B-movie ridiculousness. The score is a typical tug at your emotions embarrassments. Plot advancements, not character development dominate the story. Another no-fun contrived farce!",Basic Instinct 2
116,jayce2279,Not as good as the first one but worth a look,3,15 May 2007,"I've always had a special place in my heart for the first Basic Instinct movie. Back in the early 90s, you didn't have instant internet access like you have today. So the easiest way for adolescent males to look at naked female bodies was to head over to your local video store and rent any one of the broad selection of outdated low budget action movies that were available to you. Needless to say those films were not exactly top of the line material. But then came along Basic Instinct, a film loved by male teens whose hormones were running amok, adults looking for an exciting thriller, or just curious what all the fuzz was about, and film critics alike. Basic Instinct was special because it was not only sexually provocative (remember the interrogation and bondage scenes) but also had a strong cast, a good storyline, well developed characters, beautiful photography, fast cars and a nice setting. It was a violent police thriller in which the central character and main draw was a pantiless femme fatale with a taste for all things extreme and directed by the accomplished Paul Verhoeven, a Dutchman famous for making for harsh films with a touch of sexual provocation. Fast forward to Basic Instinct 2. Whereas Cahterine Tramell was the most intriguing figure in the first movie, she was surrounded by other equally well developed characters. Nick Kurran was the borderline cop, played by Michael Douglas, who became obsessed by the beautiful and dangerous Tramell, Jeanne Tripplehorn portrayed the jealous co-worker and Leilani Sarelle was Sharon Stone's lesbian love interest, which was pretty revolutionary in early 90s mainstream cinema.The sequel shows Catherine Tramell living in London and that's about it. Caught in her web this time around is Stan Collymore, a boring psychologist whose life is influenced by equally uninteresting women: the sexually unsatisfied ex-wife, a mother figure and mentor and some kind of love interest. I suspect the cliché London setting and subsequent cast of unknown actors was done for financial reasons. There is not a whole lot to say about the story. The movie starts off with a famous soccer player getting killed while he's making love to Catherine in her car while she's doing 110 miles an hour in downtown London, which is immediately the most exciting sexual scene in the whole movie. There is one other where Collymore has sex with his would-be girlfriend but that's a poor reproduction of Michael Douglas letting his suppressed sexual appetites rage havoc on Jeane Tripplehorn. The other erotic scenes are pretty lame compared to today's standards, especially after such extreme opening credits and taking into consideration Catherine Tramell's sexy outfits. Why would anyone want to go see an erotic thriller whose love scenes are tamer than a Britney Spears concert? Sharon Stone does look as beautiful and seductive as she did in the first film. However, whereas in the early 90s Catherine Tramell wore sexy outfits, made even more exciting because it was obvious she didn't wear any underwear, she was still pretty elegantly dressed. Her clothes in the sequel are designed for the sole purpose of turning men on. So all in all, I conclude that director Michael Caton-Jones has pretty much exploited the sexually provocative aspect of the first movie (but not in a very good way, unless the unrated version features a lot of spicy cut scenes) and neglected all of the other aspects that made Paul Verhoeven's film so special. Is it any coincidence he's since gone on to direct the critically acclaimed Blackbook and Basic Instinct 2 was nominated for worst film of 2006? So, if you were an adolescent male in the early 90s, whose sexual fantasies where forever influenced by Miss Tramell or if you just like Sharon Stone, who looks as good as ever, go check this film out, even if it's just for nostalgia's sake. If it's an exciting crime story you're looking for, better go watch one of the other erotic thrillers Basic Instinct paved the way for, like Body of Evidence, Disclosure or Sliver.",Basic Instinct 2
117,Doctor_No,"It's not to say that ""Instinct"" is completely horrid but more that the sequel is uninspired and Stone has lost the sex appeal",2,25 March 2006,"Another lame sequel that loses its touch along the lines of well story plot, acting, directing and etc. Sharon Stone is in her what? 50's now? And she tries to swindle and attracts other males, lets face it she can't attract anyone. Her character much like herself has become old and feeble which is much like the story, three in a row. When we last saw her she was cunning and in a relationship with a Detective (Michael Douglas) but in this case is obviously dead and the whole act should be dead along with him. Anyway, she again tries to evade being caught by her shrink and carries on the act again. ""Instinct"" can't go any where but down, we know who she is so the whole plot was a waste. And I'm surprised it even got a wide release my speculations were direct to video. If you must see Sharon Stone in this god awful sequel then what for the DVD release and rent it.",Basic Instinct 2
118,purban,"Okay...probably a 7, but the pleasant surprise makes it an 8",8,25 July 2006,"Really, I think this movie is more an example of an easy target than a truly bad film. In fact, the movie is done very well in many respects and is very entertaining.Yes, the script is a little convoluted, but that's the genre. The film has a noirish atmosphere centered around a femme fatale. Just like all the old noir classics, this, too, has a screenplay that twists you around so that you don't always know how to make sense of it at first, and it can be a stretch if you think too deeply and try to put all of the pieces together. That's the genre. In general, the script has enough surprises and turns to keep the viewer guessing and, in turn, surprised, without abandoning the viewer.Sharon Stone is also an easy target. The truth is she looks great and she speaks her double-entendre laden dialog in such a way as to zhuzh it up into something mysterious, sexy and fun.The direction is more than passable, because let's face it--you have to keep an audience interested in the ""did she or didn't she?"" question for two hours. In addition to a twisty script and a fun performance by Stone, this is done effectively through the direction by the creation of a noirish atmosphere that is both dark and very stark and modern at the same time, with straight industrial lines to go along with Stone's sexy curves. The frame is always beautiful--press pause anywhere and there is something interesting to the eye.The film also effectively builds on things that were gimmicks in the first film and turns them into something a little more real, particularly the sex. ""Katherine Tramell is bisexual...how shocking!"" becomes treated more matter-of-factly here, and typically, the sexuality of the film is used to better effect. It is still titillating, but not done so readily for shock value and buzz as done in the first. I won't say that it isn't still somewhat of a gimmick because, let's face it, this film is supposed to be fun.And a fun film it is. It may be an easy target, but if you watch it for what it is: a noirish, femme-fatale driven, twisty, sexy, did-she-or-didn't-she who-dunnit, you're bound to enjoy it (no pun intended).",Basic Instinct 2
119,BrettC,Why I liked the WORST movie of the year...,7,3 April 2006,"Just got back from a Monday night showing of Basic Instinct 2. We had maybe twelve people in the theatre, all couples. I was with my single mom friend Jennifer who has somewhat provincial tastes (she loves chick flicks!). The plot was silly, and the lines were some real groaners. But what else is new? Michael Douglas and Sharon Stone had horrible lines too, and the plot was ludicrous in the first installment. The sequel was bad enough to chase off two rather offended looking couples who scurried for the door halfway through the screening. Yes, the film is bad. But what did anyone expect? It's chock full of sex, murder, and double entendres. Sharon Stone is past her ""sell-by"" date to play a seductress nobody can resist, and she seems like Joan Crawford in one of those B-pictures the flailing diva did late in her career (Strait-Jacket or Trog anyone?). But for some damn reason I can't totally dismiss the film. As unimaginative as it was, I still had an absolute blast. Sharon Stone may be 48, but her boobs are probably only sixteen years old at best. I'm sorry, but I admire the hell out of her for having the balls to try and pull this one off. And guess what? She kind of does. Her voice is lower, she has to wear a lot of make-up, but Catherine Tramell is still in there begging to come out. She's still hotter than half the stars in Hollywood half her age, and reigns as the ""Queen of Mean"" (maybe even more so after hearing what all she's done after being famous). I had a hard time buying a shrink would fall for her. But then again in the first installment, why would a homicide detective? Paul Morrisey looks great, and does all he can to make sure his character is more subtle than the cocksure Michael Douglas San Francisco detective from the original. It's a more restrained journey, but he's English and a psychologist. In a way it's a nice contrast to the first. And how in the hell did they get Charlotte Rampling and David Thewlis? They both turn in their usual fine performances providing exactly what the script demands of them (not much, but they make the most of it). Most of all, I just had a really good time. It's not a brilliant film by any means, but I was never bored. The movie, Sharon Stone, and David Morrisey all look good. I liked Catherine's new fixation with auto-erotic asphyxiation (belts around the neck right before orgasm). It's simply a vanity project for Stone, but she still has some sex appeal left even at nearly half a decade. Sure it's all like some kinky car crash, but you can't take your eyes off it. I'm trashy for saying it, but I liked it. It very well may be a hoot to call it ""the worst film of the year"" or ""top pick for a Razzie"", but in the final analysis it entertained me. Don't believe the hype, it's still a fun adult erotic thriller. And I for one can't wait for the inevitable ""unrated"" DVD. It'll sit happily nestled between my copy of the original and Catwoman. Somehow it seems to fit right in - not as great as the first, but not nearly as bad as Stone's turn in the Halle Berry flick. Because at least here she looks good, and happy to be back.",Basic Instinct 2

Others come close to the originals (My father the Hero, both the 1994 and the 1991 versions are with Gerard Depardieu). Some remakes are a little less interesting than the originals (point of no return vs. Nikita, Vanilla Sky vs. Abre los Ojos), others are distinctly worse (Hypercube vs. Cube).And then there are those that should never have been made. Basic Instinct 2 is of this category.

121,arus_royus,Just giving it a ten because it doesn't deserve a one.,10,20 March 2012,"Quite a few reviewers have given this movie only 1 star... now either they really hated this movie (which I am not going to go into) or they have never seen a 1 star movie. 1 star movies are so bad..., well it's beyond description, best you go and see for yourselves and check out the ""Bottom 100"" on IMDb and torment yourself for a couple hours.Now I really enjoyed the first one, a classic thriller, great cinema (there are movies which everyone accepts that they are great, cause they cause no controversy and then there are movies which will divide the race, so to speak), very suspenseful and gripping.Now to the second one, it's definitely not a 1 star movie. For entertainment value alone it is well worth watching. Sure it has it's flaws and isn't as exciting as number one, but overall a nice movie. I am sure if it had come out on it's own, without a prequel to live up to, there wouldn't have been such a big hate fuss. For anyone who likes thrillers and some suspenseful entertainment I recommend this movie. To all those who hated this movie (I heard that many people hated it even before it came out), I am actually pretty curious on what your biases are based on, it sure isn't a logical issue, since logic doesn't inspire such strong resentment. But I myself got movies which are actually good but I just don't like them, so in fact I can empathize with you.So to sum it up, I'd give the movie a rating 7 out of 10 just for entertainment value, which it fulfilled just nicely.",Basic Instinct 2
122,d_anast,Mae West Reincarnated,3,2 April 2006,"Sharon Stone is sharp. So sharp she perceived that since the script was so hackneyed the only way to salvage anything out of this mess was to have a seance and ask Mae West's advice about self-parody and apply the lesson to a magnificent comic turn that could rival anything from the original cast of Saturday Night Live. On every level except one this thing is derivative, silly, and an enormous waste of talented people. David Thewlis and Charlotte Rampling, for instance, have always been risk takers and acted out of the box; here I guess a paycheck became more important than consideration of their parts. Only Sharon gave me my money's worth as the new Mae West and if you want to spend some time observing her high camp please go see this.",Basic Instinct 2
123,wgranger,A guilty pleasure,9,2 August 2006,"No, this is not my favorite movie of all time, and not as good as the original (but really how many sequels really are), but I still enjoyed it as a guilty pleasure. A guilty pleasure, by the way, is a movie that you know should be panned but you can't help but like it. The original movie is hard to beat, but I thought the current writers and director did an excellent job of making a reasonable sequel. Remember, many critics panned ""For Your Eyes Only"", the James Bond film following ""Moonraker."" But I enjoyed ""For Your Eyes Only"" because it was more down-to-earth (literally) than the out-of-this-world ""Moonraker."" Really, how could you top the original ""Basic Instinct""? Would it have been believable to have the same character, Catherine Trammell, attracted to another cop in L.A. or Sacramento? No, so I think it was reasonable to change the venue and fall guy, but keep the primary reason to watch this psychological thriller - Sharon Stone's totally amoral femme fatale character as she wreaks havoc on a more genteel London populace. These London characters still have their flaws as did the San Francisco ones and this made it all the more believable as to how they could all be sucked in by Trammell's character. Part of the guilty pleasure of watching this movie is wondering whether she is actually a serial killer or has deftly manipulated other people to do the actual murders. I thought the ending was more satisfying than the original movie. The only thing I didn't like about this film was that the soft-spoken British accent made it hard to understand parts of the film. I had to see it twice to fully understand what was going on.",Basic Instinct 2
124,cmivie,This movie should have never been made.,4,27 December 2006,"I was thinking the same thing many of you were when I learned that this movie was being made (and then eventually debuted in 2006). Why make a sequel to Basic Instict? Still, even wondering ""why"" this movie was made, I knew that I would eventually sit down and watch it. The original was nothing great, but at the time of its' release (1992) Basic Instinct turned our heads because it was a film that Sharon Stone sold (cause of her good looks, the fact that the role of Catherine Trammell was one that she ""made"", her uncrossing of her legs, and some wild sex scenes). Seriously. You mention Basic Instinct and the first thing out of people's mouths is talking about Stone's character. In a nutshell, she made that movie. I am not saying that Verhooven did not do a good job directing it, or that Douglas was a slouch. But we all know damn well that Stone was the star of Basic Instinct. I am saying this simply because I think that is why this sequel was greenlit. But, 14 years removed from the first one, there are some painful realizations here. First is the fact that Stone is not the star she was back in the early to mid ninties. Second is the fact that (in this day and age) nothing seems to be ""controversial"" anymore when it regards the subject of sex. I mean, back in 1992, Stone uncrossing her legs made major waves. You do that now and it barely even registers on the newsline. Even as painful as these two realizations are, I am willing to bet that had this sequel been made, say in 1995, then Stone could have sold it by herself. But in 2006, and after watching Basic Instinct 2, I think we can all agree that this movie should never have been made.Now, the film does start off with a promising beginning, in which Stone's character, Catherine Trammell, is speeding down the streets of London with some guy who is all doped up on some sort of drug. I say promising cause she is driving at 110 MPH while she is helping the guy get her off while she drives. Now, I am sorry, but I found this to be ""hot"", and I was once again reminded why Stone (as Trammell) made me have ""happy, happy thoughts"" when she played her in Basic Instinct. Even at the age of 47 or 48, Stone looks good. I don't care if she has had plastic surgery. Stone is freaking hot at her age. But after this scene is done, the movie becomes a mess.As was done in the first film, BI2 asks us the same question, ""Is Catherine Trammell a murderer?"". Now, the element that is added to BI2 with this question is that we learn Trammell has a ""Risk Addiction"". In fact, we are to believe that she thrives on it. From the opening sequence (speeding car while masturbating) we see evidence that supports this theory. But, the movie loses this element once Trammell starts to try and manipulate her therapist (who is about as bland an actor as I have seen). Don't get me wrong. When Stone plays Trammell as the manipulator, it works. Thing is, in Basic Instinct, you could never quite figure out if Trammell really was a killer. Heck, to this day, there are people who still believe that she was the killer in Basic Instinct. But in BI2, it is so easy to see through her. You know darn well that she is not killing anybody. Manipulating things? Oh yes, she does do that. Killer? Nope. Now, had the movie focused more on the ""risk addiction"" theme, I think we could have had a better, more interesting story. But what BI2 tried to become is Basic Instinct all over again....just 14 years later. And that just does not suffice.The twists and turns in BI2 seems to be thrown together, without any explanation as to why they are happening. And the sex scenes? Well, nothing really to write about here cause you saw it all in the first film (minus the orgy). Douglas and Tripplehorn did the ""doggy style"" scene that we saw in BI2....only the one in BI is better and had more tension in it. No ice pick stabbing while having sex. In fact, there really isn't a lot of sex in BI2. So, nothing to write about as far as the sex scenes go.Overall, the movie should not have been made. Having said that, I still think Stone did as good a job in BI2. I did not feel that she ""forced"" any of her lines, especially the ones in which she is manipulating people. She knows how to play Trammell, and this turned out to be the lone bright spot of BI2.",Basic Instinct 2

I didn't like this!,3,29 December 2018,"From the OVERUSED, INSIPID BACKGROUND MUSIC, to Trammell/Stone being an EXTREMELY manipulative woman who AFAIC only gets to have extensive influence over first Nick Curran (in the original B I movie) then over psychiatrist Michael Glass in B Instinct 2, Trammell only gets her way because she is found to be pretty and sexy by those 2 men. This movie doesn't cut it. As someone who has been BURNED BADLY by people I allowed to get very close to me for years who were extremely MANIPULATIVE, I despise the practical glorification of Trammell's character. I place manipulation way down there with lying and other major deficits of human behavior.

127,Lord_Frog,The Bitch is back!,5,17 April 2006,"So, Basic Instinct 2... as crap as they say? Nope, just very average. I've seen hundreds of worse movies. As good as the first one? Nope, lightyears away actually. Worth watching? I only wanted to see this because I loved the 1st movie and Catherine Tramell's character. So after reading the reviews, and expecting the worst, I went to see it anyway.The premise is an interesting one, unfortunately the producers hired the writers of ""Desperately Seeking Susan"". WTF? Why?! The result is a by-the-numbers screenplay without much excitement, sex scenes or murders. The problem is that audiences have become used to the fact that sequels are supposed to at least try to be bigger than the original movies they're based on. But here, it's a much smaller film. Apart from the opening scene, there's no action at all. Lots of mind manipulation through dialogue instead. It kind of works since when the end comes it becomes harder to be sure of the killer's identity. Did Tramell do it? One minute you're sure of it, the next other possibilities are creeping in your mind. I enjoyed that aspect of the film, even if it's far, very very far from a masterpiece.Sharon Stone camps it up big time compared to her performance in the original, but I thought she was fun to watch, and even though she definitely doesn't look 30 anymore, she's still good as the evil temptress.",Basic Instinct 2
128,appealing_talent,Role Reprisal,9,30 September 2012,"Well, well, well, here we have the nasty novelist Catherine Tramell at it again. She manipulates everyone and everything she can, creating drama, so that she won't get bored. Her efforts result in art imitating life, or could that be vice-versa? This time around she's visiting England and her attitude is as hardened as her facial features. There's nothing, whatsoever, subtle about it. She sets her sites on an analyst, with a guilty conscience and spins a web of lies and deceit designed to drive the poor sucker mad. His friends and foes alike, as flies would do, get stuck in the sticky netting and die by way of her calculating strategies. It's all for the sake of a good storyline for her latest best seller, a thriller based on her victims and the circumstances she enmeshes them in. I'm purposely reserving my comments for Sharon Stone, since the film is really a showcase for her and she is the main focus around whom the first class production values and excellent soundtrack revolves. Aside from a few instances of unnecessary trite dialogue, for which I deleted one point, the acting and story are uniformly well done.The only thing a bit difficult to understand is how Stone's Catherine manages to snow the seemingly intelligent women, as well as the vainglorious men she plays with. Apart from an initially sly, glib meeting with Charlotte Rampling's character, an analyst cohort of the 'leading man,' we aren't really privy to her approach, or technique, used on other females. Most of her motivation is predominately sexual, with violent undertones, so it's somewhat of a mystery as to how she manages to deploy the heterosexual women who are vital in her plot. Her quest for complete control, despite whatever risk involved, is rapacious and positively palpable. But the more mature ice-cold Catherine displays no hint of vulnerability, as she did in her earlier veneer and is seemingly guided by pure unadulterated hatred. Does she succeed in her Machiavellian treachery? It's worth the time spent watching to find out.Sharon Stone portrays Catherine as a stylish, mockingly evil, villainess. Although I've read many negative critiques regarding her hair and overall appearance in terms of age, these comments are only opinions based on the superficial aspects of her physical presence. Since she is supposed to embody beauty, both of face and form, some reviewers have gotten caught up in their own personal estimations and judgments of what signifies beauty to them. The purposeful blunt hair cut is chic, modish and sophisticated, exemplifying Catherine's, sharpness. Her face, while more mature, still holds up to scrutiny as being extremely attractive. Her breasts are shown on a few occasions and appear to have been enhanced, to prevent sagging, but it was very good work if that's the case. All in all, as far as femme fatales are concerned, simply put, Stone is in the same class as the best of them...",Basic Instinct 2

130,vpa21133,I'd rather stick my head in a toilet for two hours...,2,3 September 2006,"The primary failure of this film relative to the original is an aged, faded Sharon Stone who is supposed to portray an irresistible sex goddess. That just does not work at all. In the first Basic Instinct she was credible as a sexy young beauty exploring the boundaries of her ability to control men by exploiting their lust for her.I've noticed many other comments say ""Wow, look at Sharon Stone, she is almost 50 and still attractive and sexy - that's incredible!"" That is nonsense. It is ridiculous to say that mature women can't be attractive and sexy. What I would expect (and I am a 50-year-old man), is that an attractive woman of that age range would be more subtle and sophisticated about her sexuality. The way Stone's character acts in this film, I'd expect to find her as an old drunk falling off a bar stool in a trailer park in Dog Fart, Kentucky rather than as supposedly glamorous, world-famous novelist.The secondary failure is David Morrisey's character, supposed to be a psychiatrist or psychologist. How could the character have an M.D. or Ph.D. degree when he is a moron who apparently never got past puberty sexually?The tertiary failure is the complete unbelievability of the plot. How can one believe it is many years since the first film, Stone's character continues to be suspected of multiple murders, yet she is still free? At the rate people Stone knows get murdered, everyone she ever knew would have been dead five years before they made this film.Even though I found the first Basic Instinct over-the-top and occasionally unintentionally laughable, it worked much better than this putrid sequel.",Basic Instinct 2

As Catherine lives her life she both discovers and is discovered to be the full extent of an achiever.In this case, an ambitious English psychiatrist, Dr. Glass, recently knighted by the Queen, is trying to advance to a prestigious academic award. He encounters Tramell as an expert to the prosecution against her. Examination Tramell: Oh, I bet you like to take risks, don't you, Dr. Glass. Glass: But I'm not the one who's on trial for murder.

At this point, it begins to become clear that the psychiatrist is not a person of true quality in an overall sense.He begins to stalk Tramell to find answers to appease his mistaken sense of character. When the cards are down he is left holding a smoking gun.In the final scene he is shown to be an incurable psychiatric patient.As a ball in play is a concept, so is a man. How well does anyone know themselves?Milena Gardosh is thrown out of the way because she does not gel according to the removed observations of Glass who desperately chases after a fleeting vision of establishing obvious meaning. Glass is a hollow entity, a success-seeker who comes to be at a great disadvantage one day. Glass is actually a debased character who uses his career to artifice a meaningful life but is nonetheless drowning in desperation. The saying is that life never changes and Glass and Washburn are caught in that cycle of desperation. The difference being Glass and Washburn are profoundly isolated as opposed to being a part of the good life. What if anything could establish their pursuits as just pursuits and provide the humanity that Glass and Washburn are reluctant or incapable of establishing?Glass and Washburn factor into the inhuman world and are sideswiped by the alien world of success. They inadvertently concede that they are not a big deal when they agree to take exception to an investigation. Their hard side is a lie because honesty is based on an inappropriate compromise of abusing their office to stage revenge prosecutions or extra personal controversies. In this particular case when they take exception and can no longer own the law they are weeded out as failed experiments by a golden girl.Tramell is largely a benefactor who inserts a reason to live into her friends and fans. The people who welcome Tramell share in her observance of a greater love of life and death. Tramell has a completely honest introduction and a completely honest conclusion in that she is guilt free with some grey in-between.

134,Screen-Space,Worse than any of us could have imagined.....,1,22 March 2006,"It's not like I have overwhelmingly fond memories of Verhoeven's original pants-down shocker - it always struck me as a glossy, well-made airport-novel-of-a-movie. Thrilling, sexy trash, but trash nonetheless. It was also a film that tapped into a certain sexual zeitgeist. After a decade of anti-sex AIDS-induced hysteria, a film about a wildly-sexual hotbod who thrill-kills to heighten her sexual pleasure was pretty enticing stuff. Basic Instinct 2 was always going to struggle to provide the same social relevance and immediacy, so the fact that it's desperate attempts at raunchiness are so lame can sort-of be overlooked. All it really had to provide was that thin veneer of titillation and a mildly engaging story and all would have been watchable. That it resoundingly fails on so many levels, and in such a way to be a career nadir for everyone involved, is really quite extraordinary to watch. Let's state the obvious for starters - Sharon Stone is too old for the part of sexual magnet Catherine Trammell. What was so photogenic thru Verhoeven's lens looks like mutton dressed as lamb in the hands of gun-for-hire Michael Caton-Jones, who's flat, drab colours and static camera render her undeniable beauty totally moot. I like Sharon Stone a lot, but if the first film launched her career, BI2 could kill it. She has no chemistry with stuffed-shirt David Morrissey - their only sex scene is embarrassing too watch. His dough-faced mamma's boy of a character made me yearn for the swaggering, orange-skin machismo of Michael Douglas. Supporting turns by David Thewlis and Charlotte Rampling waste these fine actors on talky exposition scenes and cliché-heavy posturing. And what of the much-touted sexual shenanigans? Poorly-lit, fleetingly-glimpsed, as utterly mainstream as an episode of Desperate Housewives - the European sensibilities that Verhoeven brought to the sexual content of the first film are sorely missed. Don't watch this film for carnal thrills - there are none and what there is is tragic. The film is, as a whole, convoluted to the point of utter confusion, boring and laughable. The last 40 minutes in particular, where you come to the realisation that the film is, in fact, not going to go anywhere of interest at all, are particularly gruelling and hilarious in equal measure. As a failed sequel, Basic Instinct 2 will come to occupy similar cinematic ground as Exorcist 2 The Heretic, Beyond The Poseidon Adventure and XXX2. As a vanity project, it rivals Battlefield Earth in its misconception. As a multi-million dollar piece of Hollywood film-making, it's a travesty that will be hard to top as the years worst.",Basic Instinct 2
135,neighborlee,Watch the movie closer if you didn't get the 'ending'; great crime thriller!,10,21 April 2013,"First off, I did not see BI1, nor do I 'need' to, because either a movie movies me, or it does not. THis did, to the extent that I kept watching, though I was getting tired as it was after midnight.When I saw the very LOW score of 4 or such from some reviewers here, and also saw that they didn't 'get' the ending, I knew I had to chime in immediately.The ending , which I won't divulge, may not have the twisting involvement of a Sherlock Holmes, but it's intriguing enough to have made me wish for #3 to see about getting This scheming, cold , but brilliant writer her just rewards . That's how great of a job Sharon Stone did in this, and the supporting cast and crew while new to me, I felt did a completely adequate job of sinking my attention further and further into the tawdry, deceptive and thrilling plot's development.When we talk about a thriller, we can't help but give respect to Alfred HitchCock's 'The Birds', and while BI2 did most certainly not rise to that occasion ( in part due to the content/script) and there was a lot to rise TO,- it most certainly brought it right to the BRINK of it, with great character allure and thought provoking twists and turns throughout it.If you are looking for something to watch late at night and be on edge for those few hours, wondering if a murderer would go free, victims would be saved and who really did it and why, then this movie is certainly worth your time.",Basic Instinct 2

Compared to Sharon Stone, Madonna is too coarse and BAUERISCH. She's not even close. EVIL INCARNATE: Sharon Stone is a bit long in the tooth, the ameliorative effects of modern chemistry and surgery notwithstanding. However, she artfully treats us to a frightening personification of evil beyond redemption. In the obligatory sex scene, she projects pure, crystalline lust. Especially her hooded, luminous eyes and a face flat with pleasure. Thanks to brilliant use of lighting and other stage techniques, the harsh lines of age are only occasionally manifest. Rather, she seems to have a slight golden glow (YES, YEATS). The locations gave us a view of London that is a welcome departure from the usual Londonscapes .The Catherine character is so powerful and menacing that I thank my lucky stars that our paths never crossed. I wouldn't have had a chance.THE ORIGINAL BASIC INSTINCT; ATTEMPTS AT CENSORSHIP: I must briefly comment on the original 1992 film, set in San Francisco, a beautiful city worthy of this film. It is outstanding, from the music to the locations to the sets, and so on. Paul Verhoven pulled striking performances out of the cast and crew. That the main Baddie was a woman did not escape the scrutiny of Bay Area Gay and Lesbian activist groups. Attempts at censorship were vehemently denied. SWELL. These philosophical pygmies demanded editorial control over the script, insisting on re-writes that would promote their political and psychiatrically driven agendas. Example: Sanctimoniously alleging sexism and misogyny, they demanded that the lead role be switched from BAD GIRL to BAD GUY. On locations in San Francisco, the gentle, tolerant activists did their best to sabotage filming of the scenes with noise, flashing lights and other tactics. The Executive Producers, Mario Kassar and Andrew Vajna, vowed to fight any efforts to restrict the artistic freedom guaranteed in our democracy and obtained restraining orders against the disruptive tactics. BLOWBACK: Thanks to the fulminating activists, the film got huge national press coverage - millions of dollars worth of free advertising. Their calls for viewers to boycott the film resulted in a backlash that had customers waiting in long lines wherever the film was launched. It also received widespread critical acclaim. It was, in the words of the reptilian Hackett in NETWORK, ""A BIG- TITTED HIT!"" Sorry, Gentle Reader; I just couldn't resist that one. Yes, it's a gibe.In conclusion, I believe that both BASIC INSTINCT 1 AND 2, with their brilliant musical scores, aesthetics and acting, are works of art that deserve protection under our Constitution.",Basic Instinct 2

140,julie_bartholemy,Boring...,3,2 February 2007,"I saw this movie months and months ago so I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, but I do remember being bored. When I walked into the theater and got my ticket I was expecting a fun, clever thriller, I got a boring sex-thriller-film that was supposed to make Stone a big Hollywood star again. Sure she looks good (who wouldn't after all that work she had done, she's 40 going on 20...impossible) even still she annoyed me.A lot of money and hard work has been put into this movie and for that I give this movie a 3 and that's nice of me. The story just didn't grasp my attention, if during the whole movie all I could think of was, ""no way in hell she looks like that without help"" and ""what is that 12-year old doing watching this movie"" and I don't think that was the point of the movie.Don't waste your time or money, but if you really want to see it, watch it when it comes on TV, because it's not worth the rental.",Basic Instinct 2
141,doorbomb62,Writers could not pull off what Joe Eszterhas created.,4,1 July 2015,"There's really no way to pull off a sequel to the original classic, Basic Instinct. To do so would require much more than Sharon Stone who sizzles no matter what she is doing. She a fine actress, but surrounding her with unfamiliar actors in London, and handling a script that lacks everything witty and tight that Joe Eszterhas weaved in the original picture, is just disastrous.Our story here has Ms. Tramell, notorious author from Basic Instinct at the epicenter of a death, accidental, or perhaps...intentional??? She is handled by Scotland yard in this one, a far cry from the San Fransisco PD and Detective Nick Curan, who is sorely absent. Rather than prance around with her sexuality tugging at the police, and seducing them blindly, she is more a bully here, and she pushes authoritative figures, especially Michael Glass the professional assigned to her case, into her game this time around.Sharon Stone turns in a mostly witty and sharp (no pun intended) continuation of Catherine Tramell, Complete with incomparable physique, sexy sultry voice, and some more blonde poison. Her co-stars, however, do not measure up.U.K. veteran Charlotte Rampling is the only other cast member/character on Stones level. The rest of the cast are like fish out of water. I think it's part of why the film doesn't work. We have very stiff European authoritative figures, bent on the unraveling of the case, as well they should be, except it doesn't feel like Basic Instinct, and the good moments that are had, are reminders that it might have been better had they stuck with the original idea which was to have been set in NYC.The production design and art direction are diabolical though (again, no pun intended), and it's a scene set greatly, if only the expectations were met. Ultimately I feel the writing was the biggest let down. It's as if Leora Barish and Henry Bean didn't know the character of Catherine, and thusly could not completely tell her story. Whatever they have for every one else is a more or less lacking shadow of what the original was.Michael Caton-Jones is okay, but this flick, released in 2006, looks like EVERY other action thriller from that time period, and that's sad. The original was a cut (there I go again)above the rest of what was released back in 1992. It had so much style and charisma, and even charm, mixed with an extremely interwoven and complex, even abstract plot/story. This is just a run-of-the-mill follow up sequel that is as bland and boring as every other product that was churned out by studios at the time. It's all in your face at value, which is not very high. There is noting beyond the cheese & crackers. The cigar is just the cigar, and in this films case, it needed to be a highly intoxicating cigarette.",Basic Instinct 2
142,twilightseer,As awful as it gets,2,3 July 2007,"I thought that BI2 could not be as bad as most reviews said it was. Well, it turns out that I was wrong. BI2 is indeed a serious piece of crap without any redeeming factor. The movie is disastrous and dismal on all levels. BI was a sexy thriller and in it, Sharon Stone was the epitome of the deadly seductress. 14 years after, Catherine Tramell has become a poor shade of her former self: she's as sexy as a lead pipe and about as dangerous as my mother's best friend. David Morrissey is ghastly beyond belief. Charlotte Rampling seems to be lost in that mess (why in the world did she accept such an uninteresting part? Taxes to pay, perhaps?). David Thewlis is the only one who actually seems to do his actor's job but it's a complete waste. The material is so terrible that not even Jack Nicholson could do anything with it. The script is the biggest load of codswallop I've seen in recent years. Did the writers actually think the ending was a good one? My take is that they thought that the audience is mostly made of imbecils who'll swallow anything hook, line and sinker provided it's labelled as a plot twist. To me, that kind of ending is just insulting to the audience. And don't expect anything raunchy in this movie; it simply isn't there. The so-called hot scenes are: Sharon Stone getting fingered offscreen while driving a car at 110MPH (she climaxes before the car falls down in the Thames), Sharon Stone going at it with a guy in some club and finally Sharon Stone displaying her breasts while getting in a jacuzzi. Believe me, it's way hotter when you write it than when you see it. It's not even softcore in my book. Lame stuff that's all. So don't bother renting this just for saucy stuff, you'll be very disappointed. There is nothing remotely intense, sexy or interesting in BI2, only the promise that you will waste 110 minutes of your life that you'll never get back. If you want a thriller, watch Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"". If you want nudity and sex, rent any good porn film, there are plenty out there and unlike BI2, they actually deliver the goods.

Catherine Trammell remains an exciting and fascinating heroine and I'm sure a lot of people would like that have seen what she was up to these days. Their biggest mistake was toning down the sexuality.The original Basic Instinct is still, to this day, one of the sexiest and most controversial mainstream films of all time. The fact that a film that sexually frank (and also violent) played in suburban theaters to middle brow audiences is a bit of a miracle. Why did Basic Instinct 2 feel the need to tone that down and become respectable.Basic Instinct 2 isn't that bad. It's competently made with good actors and well lit/shot. If this were a made for TV rip off of the original film, people would probably love it, but it's not and that's the main issue - it refuses to take risks like the original did. Where the original film was sexually explicit and shockingly violent at times, this sequel takes a much more subdued approach. Sure, it could still be considered shocking to an audience of nuns or schoolchildren, but it's nowhere near as daring as the original.It's still nice to see for Sharon Stone, who looks gorgeous (in spite of some unfortunate bangs).",Basic Instinct 2

Both for the very first time.The first one got me excited as the actors were great and the story pretty cool. A great crime movie. I knew about the bad reputation the second installment has and expected a flop. But I did not get one. I got a movie full of honestly great actors, great environments and a great plot. The camera, sound, music, editing, actors, suspense... Everything is on top. I loved the movie and frankly have no idea why it is rated bad and why was it nominated for razzie awards. I guess you have to have a black sheep every year to point a finger at and unfortunately for the Basic Instinct 2 this movie was that black sheep in 2006.I rated Basic Instinct 9/10 because I was really entertained and I am rating the second one also 9/10 because I was entertained as well and even a bit more because the movie is more current to me as it was shot in 2006 and I am a younger person.

145,Newairbus,Sexy Beast,5,28 April 2006,"Hey, Basic Instinct 2 feels like a Agatha Christie novel written for a sexy protagonist and a modern setting. But there is no Miss Marple involved, for she is at the same time the woman who gets away, the author and the ""gärningskvinna"" or perpetrator. The word in quotes is Swedish, not German, though it looks like ""Götterdammerung"". Everybody and his cousin has chided Sharon Stone for being such a wooden actress cast in this role for the second time, but put your hand on your heart: Could someone else have pulled off the part (which is provocative and implausible from the beginning) any better? Would Keira Knightley, Gwyneth Paltrow or Lena Olin have portrayed a better Catherine Tramell? My verdict is no, therefore, she gets a vindication of sorts. You see, this role doesn't require a perfect body but rather someone who almost has it with brains, conceit and assuredness on top of that. Also, this sequel is good in the sense that it has made me want to see the first part which I missed to see at the time.",Basic Instinct 2

The plot is awful...but on the plus side the acting is pretty good, with a few good shouts and rants. Sharon stone is OK this time...not even half as good as the original mind you. The murders aren't as gory as the first one either, which is a shame. Its not the unpredictable mess everyone say it is though. The sex is pretty graphic at times while others it is clear it is fake (they are fully clothed). The script is weak most of the time, but the scenes with banter and arguments between Dr.Glass and Washburn are highlights. The plot twists a few times, but the ending is awful. The tension is always constant with a huge dollop of 'Oh my god!'. The chase sequences are brilliantly directed, and shots and camera angles are impressive and bring a bit of class to an otherwise, rush-felt film. Sharon stone is a bit old for this too. The bits where we see her breasts were, in the first one, delights. This time around, they are too horrid to describe. The films its self is rather average, but it is worth a go. Mainly because the film does deserve some good buzz...with the opening sequence being a highlight. Not to be critical, but if you liked the first one - leave this one. Don't ruin the run.

148,TTaipale,Sequel - Why does one make them?,4,4 January 2007,"Basic Instinct was a classic as it came out in the early 90's. It's sexual contents and the erotic chemistry between Sharon Stone and Michael Douglas made it one of the movies that most people new. It brought something new into the movies, although the same kind of erotic thrillers were already available as paperback novels.The question that rises always before actually watching a sequel to a movie is, that why does one actually make those movies. The same question rises also when watching this film: Basic Instinct 2. Whereas the first one is thrilling, the second part has none of that chemistry. The only one doing a decent role is Sharon Stone.David Morissey wasn't a name for me before this film and I have to say that although he was not really bad, he lacked everything that Michael Douglas had. Perhaps one of the reason was also that the director of the movie wasn't at the level of the first one and neither was the whole script.Basic Instinct 2 is not really a movie that one should see. It doesn't have any really thrilling moments and it is lacking in every aspect that would make it a good and entertaining movie.",Basic Instinct 2

The only part of the story that is the least bit unrealistic, is the fact that Sharon Stone's character is still alive and not in jail at this late date.SPOILER ALERT: As the movie progresses, we are presented with three theories of what is going on: 1) Sharon Stone's character is killing all these people because she's crazy (Risk Addicted); 2) David Thewlis' crooked cop is killing these people in order to frame Sharon Stone's character; 3) David Morrissey's analyst is killing these people for revenge. What upsets most people about the movie seems to be that none of these theories are ever explicated as the ""real"" story. (Although the analyst is in a psychiatric care facility for killing the cop; the only killing that occurs on screen.)I think this is a brilliant plot device in the spirit of ""2001, A Space Odyssey."" WHO CARES what is real? The blonde really is crazy, the cop really is crooked and the analyst really wants revenge.

That is the best descriptions of this movie i've ever heard. The plot spins out of control especially the ending which it turns out to be Dr. Glass as the killer. What is that all about, because when you watch it there isn't a shred of evidence that would make you think he's the killer, and that might sound good but it doesn't' work for this movie because we want to watch this movie because for the character of Sharon Stone. The first film reveals that she is the killer so you expect her to be at the top of her murdering game in this one as well, and she doesn't even kill anyone! She doesn't commit one murder through the whole thing and isn't that why wanted to see it in the first place, to watch a femme fatal be played wonderfully by Sharon Stone? I truly enjoyed the original film because of the movie's maine villain, Catherine Tramell was one of the best female villains in film and this movie doesn't do the character the justice she deserves. Like i said earlier, if you watch this movie, you're going to think its stupid but there is absolutely no way you will be bored.

It had silly dialogue, phony drama, unbelievable relationships and psychology. Costumes, hot girls, the crotch shot, that's what Basic Instinct I was about.Basic Instinct II is an agglomeration of small pleasures. Unfortunately it lacks the steamy sex and lingering seduction scenes that would have made it fun to watch on a scene-by-scene basis, but I say you can still salvage a fair evening's entertainment out of this harmless film if you let yourself in on the joke.Enjoy David Thewlis's performance as a fixated and demented cop, the grimy little investigative journalists, the murders, the scruffy, half-buttoned costumes, the vault-like sets, London's rainy streets, Sharon Stone's surprise hairdos, and David Morrissey's puffy-faced vulnerability. It's also fun and different to see a mature seductress in Sharon Stone. Don't ask for acting; what you get is mugging and mouthing off and posing, and Stone is fine at it.I must admit that I didn't really care who was committing the murders, but I felt a bit of suspense and was mildly amused by the ending.So all in all it was better than washing dishes or watching a DVD I've already seen a hundred times.

I was quite surprised Stone showed ""so much of herself"" but was also (pleasantly) surprised she was in SUCH good shape. Well done Miss Stone.

David morrissey is totally wasted in the Micheal douglas role (albeit this time as a brainless shrink) added with a leaden script with even more holes in it than a piece of swiss cheese after the first film. Micheal caton jones is a worthwhile and competent UK film director but he seems to have either taken the money and ran or been asleep on the job to have ever been credited for this sorry load of cobblers. the ending is a total joke and it's so obvious that indeed gaping plot scenarious were left on the cutting room floor when the entire enterprise should have also been binned in the first place.",Basic Instinct 2

However, if you rent this film for her supposed full frontal nude scene, you're going to be extremely disappointed as it's not there. There's a scene of her in an open robe with nothing underneath, but all we get is a brief flash of her breasts and no lower area views.

I, however, really enjoyed the original, and the sequel also worked for me, and I'll tell you why. BI2 isn't a masterpiece by any means, there are some problems with the plot, and if it's nudity you want, go elsewhere, there was a lot more nudity in January's Hostel. BI2 worked for me, and deserved my high score for one reason, Catherine Tramell. In my opinion Catherine is one of the best characters out there, and Sharon plays her so well, I often wonder if she doesn't have a bit of Catherine in her, herself. My biggest comparison to her would be that of the also addicting Hannibal Lecter, cause besides the eating people part, both Hannibal and Catherine are manipulative clever geniuses, you never know exactly where the truth lies, yet they are both so likable, you can't help rooting for the bad guy. Now, I'm not going to go into details on the plot, cause you get that in so many other reviews, but the point I'm making is Catherine Tramell makes BI2 a very fun experience, one that makes me hope she'll return again someday, maybe in another 14 years.",Basic Instinct 2

She is ""screwing your brain"" as Catherine with such a skill that in the end you don't be quite sure who is the real villain.As for the technical part of the film: Only real setback is the B-rate crew of actors. Sharon Stone is the only really big name in the cast compared to her and Michael Douglas etc in the first part. I also think BI2 would have been better had Sharon Stone been a bit younger but she is still quite stunning in her looks and has only improved concerning her charisma. Her B-rate ""assistants"" are not so bad either although I would have wanted some bigger names to the cast.I think there are quite good improvements in the basic plot.

I should have walked out after the first scene, so shame on me. Cigarette advertisements? It was unbelievable how many times cigarettes were lit and waved around ensuring the viewer caught that these people were smoking. Whether you are a smoker or not, it took away from the movie because it was too much too often. In fact, there were many segments in the movie where the cigarette was the whole point of the scene. Shame on the producer.It was impossible for me to get past those two major issues, but for the sake of this review here is an attempt: The movie is entertaining, it has a solid though not original plot, and a creative though unsatisfying ending. The actors play their parts well. The British setting though, to me, wasn't appropriate for this sequel. Since the first Basic Instinct was American, I fully expected the second to be also. For that reason, the movie never felt like a sequel to the outstanding first ""Basic Instinct"" and in my opinion isn't worthy of being labeled the second in the series.I was disappointed, won't watch it again, and don't recommend it.",Basic Instinct 2

It seems even more fashionable to trash Sharon Stone wholike all of usis now fourteen years older, andunlike most of usstill looks wonderful. First comments on this movie were so vicious that I had to see for myself. In my opinion, this sequel is not nearly as good as the original film, but is not as bad as most comments pretend. Michael Caton-Jones is not Paul Verhoeven, neither Henry Bean and Leora Barish are Joe Eszterhas. ""Basic Instinct 2"" is just an entertaining, average thriller, and besides the addition of Jerry Goldsmith original score, keeps little resemblance to its predecessor. Even Stone gives her character a different dimension, creating a lustful, devilish Catherine Trimell, who can perfectly well rank among other monsters like Hannibal Lecter. She is an intelligent actress who is not afraid of taking risks and can play with camp at her leisure. Unfortunately, she seems to be the main target for those who enjoy trashing this flick. She became too successful, too much of a main icon, and like all those actors who have reached that level, her time has arrived and she is now bound to be destroyed by Hollywood audiences.The rest of the cast is outstanding, giving performances that are far better than the material deserves. David Morrissey is a much better actor and by far more interesting than Michael Douglas: his acting is flawless, giving a dense, complex dimension to an otherwise one dimensional character. Since he has more screen time and is the axis of the movie, he can keep your attention from beginning to end.I am not recommending ""Basic Instinct 2"" as a great movie; I am just expressing my disagreement with most of the comments on this site and my conviction that agendas other than the movie itself are shaping the opinion of most spectators.",Basic Instinct 2
168,robspacey,Basic Rubbish,1,31 March 2006,"How are people giving this a 9 rating? Are they seriously saying this 'effort' is on the same levels as the Godfather and LOTR? Be serious, just for a minute. After all, these reviews are for people to read...OK, so for anyone under 16 or has lived in a cave for 20 years, let me bring you up to date on Basic Instinct. It was a film, made in the early nineties which, like it or not, came to be hugely influential on the film industry. It wasn't amazingly well acted, well written or particually well directed. However, what it did have was eroticism. And in huge doses. It created the Erotic-Thriller genre of the 90's and became the trend-setter for every horny guy looking for a 'proper' film.Fast forward 14 years and we have BI2: Risk Addiction. Now pay attention to the 'Risk Addiction' bit because you'll hear it about twenty times through the movie, just in case you didn't get what it's about the first time through.The film opens with Sharon Stone sucking Stan Collymore's (1990's footballer, convicted women-beater and dogger) finger as he's pushing her buttons in a night time drive over a bridge. Yes, good idea director, cast a renound real-life villain doing what he was made infamous for. Brilliant. All we need is a 'Gary Glitter at a playground' scene and the film's complete.So, we're then following the trial of Stone, on trial for Collymore's death. This is where the storyline ends. The next 90 minutes are mostly dialogue between Stone and her Psychiatrist, mostly going along the lines of this:Stone: ""Innuendo, Innuendo, Innuendo, Risk Addiction?"" Psychiatrist: ""I'm your psychiatrist"" Stone: ""Innuendo, Innuendo, Innuendo, I like playing games"" Psychiatrist: ""I'm your psychiatrist"" Stone: ""Innuendo, Innuendo, Innuendo, I'm off now, to MAYBE murder""And that's pretty much it...I've not bothered referencing all 30 seconds of erotic scenes, or AMAZING acting skills, not to mention having to see a 47 year old woman trying what only can be described as a mid-life-crisis erotic display, complete with chair. This film, is TERRIBLE. Possibly the worst film ever made - worse that Gigli, Showgirls and Striptease combined. Anyone who can even see an ounce of credibility in this film needs a head exam.",Basic Instinct 2
169,RonKlijn,Wasn't as bad as I thought,6,6 January 2013,"I didn't expect much from this movie given the reviews. A rating of 4 doesn't help my expectations however IMDb-ratings haven't got a reputation of being accurate all the time. The first let's say half hour didn't do much for me, but the rest of the movie was OK. OK, Sharon Stone is older now. I didn't see that one coming... . Acting was good, the story was good , kept me interested until the end. Conclusion must be this movie suffers from it being a sequel. When you aren't bothered by that it's a worthwhile watch. When you want to see the young and beautiful Sharon watch part 1. For the mature and still beautiful one watch this. For a nice movie you can safely watch both although the first is better.",Basic Instinct 2

The script is not terrific but it is good enough to not laughing your ass out while watching it. Sometimes the movie actually is exciting and compared with 300 which everyone seemed to love in the cold North I'm from, it is a freaking masterpiece!!

171,LizardKingBey,The movie I thought would be great is one of the worst movies ever made...,1,1 April 2006,"""Basic Instinct"" is among my favourite films. I was really excited about this one. I mean, for about two years I'd been waiting for it. And I was extremely disappointed. This is one of the worst movies ever made. The story, the dialogues, the whole script, everything is cheesy as Hell. I mean really cheesy. It's like they throw a big ball of cheese straight at your face. They tried to make a ""clever"" film but it turned out to be unbelievably stupid. David Thewlis will never get a job after that movie. He's one of the worst actors out there. The ending was just as bad. It was utterly ridiculous. Why, Sharon, why?? The ending of the first movie was left to interpretation. Well, here they tried to do something similar.. But it failed miserably. The whole movie fails miserably on every imaginable level. Sharon flashes her V once again, but even THAT fails.. It is nothing compared to the interrogation scene. This one isn't subtle at all.. she was like ""Hey LOOK everyone, LOOK, *THIS* is the moment! I'm showing it! Did you see?""... They tried to re-do the ""Latour's Blue"" scene as well, but still failed. They tried to re-do the anal rape scene from the first movie, but still failed. Also, in the first film, we discover that Catherine had an affair with Beth, cool. But in this one, she's just been having sex with everyone he knows... Wow, WHAT A TWIST! Hey THAT was clever!! Didn't see this one coming!! Anyways... Don't waste your money. I wanted to escape the theatre about an after an hour, but I wanted to see the ending. And guess what? The ending made it even worse.*I re-watched this film when it came out on DVD, 'cause I thought maybe my expectations were too high when I saw it in theatres, but no. It was just as bad, if not even worse.",Basic Instinct 2
172,betorlando35,"Bad Marketing, Bad Script and the need for A List Actor to play off of Sharon Stone",6,2 April 2006,"Well obviously by the 3 million dollar take this weekend, not as many people were ready for the return of Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct 2. First of all, Sony/MGM did a HORRIBLE marketing campaign (was there even a campaign?)for this film. Honestly I don't recall seeing much PR and I certainly did not see any ads on TV or for that matter trailers in the theatre. I am a weekly moviegoer and did not see one BI2 trailer attached to ANYTHING. Having said that I was excited to see Sharon back as Catherine. But I have to say, she just did not have that sultriness she had in the original but then she did not have a strong actor to play off of. Like a number of people mentioned, the script was confusing and to be honest weak. I did not care for the change in venues. The London setting took me out of it. The biggest problem is that other than Sharon, there is NO big names attached. At one point Pierce Brosnan had been approached and a number of other A list actors. But unlike the original which had Michael Douglas playing off of Sharon, in this movie, it is lacking. This movie should not have gone forward without an established actor for the movie and the marketing's sake to play against Sharon. I may be in the minority here but I would still love to see Sharon come back for a third film and finish it off right, this time finally getting caught.",Basic Instinct 2
173,tinome,Gorgeously photographed camp fest,9,17 July 2006,"This one's for the camp afictionados crowd (and architecture students, perhaps). Highly funny in a black and/or double-entendre way. Mrs Stone delivers an expectedly fierce performance, while Morrissey maintains a quiet stubbornness on the other side.I should mentioned that I just loved the black comedy Diabolique (advertising it as a thriller was a terrible idea, in my opinion, with a very broad use of the term ""remake"" ). Don Roos' script was full of juicy one-liners, gay humor and a definite predilection for form over content. And most of all, Stone went Lee Strasberg-ish (that self-parody ranks in her best outings, I think), improbably dressed in a film-noir-on-acid kinda way. The same applies here, except for the costumes, which are here closer to haute couture.Like I mentioned in the summary, the movie is also extremely well photographed all around London and shows great locations, old and new (a voluntary contrast), with exquisite lighting.The story, of course, is absolutely improbable, but I don't think the screenplay was a big issue here...This is guilty pleasure in all its decadent splendor. I have a feel I'll watch this one again...",Basic Instinct 2
174,mbrook6,Amazing Sequel being unfairly bashed!,10,18 April 2006,"I just saw Basic Instinct 2 again, and my opinion of the movie changed. Initially, I had a lot of issues with the movie. And then I read all of the negative press and reviews, and coupled with the awful box office, I really went in a second time with a much dimmer impression. But oddly, I very much came to love this sequel. I went back to see it looking through the lens that was created by all of the negative and vicious criticism. I went out of my way to pay attention to why people were saying this was one of the worst movies and/or sequels of all times, and I was very happy to realize that are all dead wrong. (Warning: some of this may contain slight spoilers) First, people are attacking Sharon Stone like she dressed up like the Prophet Mohammedand defecated on the screen. Her interpretation of Catherine is no different than it was in the first movie. She is SUPPOSED to be over the top. They did add a little more sarcasm to her character though, but it's because her position in the movie is different. This story definitely told from Catherine's P.O.V. She is purposely being a sarcastic and nasty and blatant about her machinations to see just how stupid these people really are. If you notice it's mostly directed towards Glass. It's a form of antagonizing him and making him angry enough to fight her, which is what she wanted. Catherine is much more exacting and evil in this sequel. I really enjoyed how much it fully exploited her character's potential.The screenplay is just as implausible as the first movie. It takes no more leaps in logic that the original. The same goes for the dialog. Actually the dialog is a little more restrained in the second one. Am I the only one who remembers: ""She's evil! She's brilliant!""? The acting in this one is also a lot more restrained. Michael Douglas wasn't all that subtle if you remember correctly.The sequel was darker and more focuses on the mind games than the first movie, which I prefer.A lot of criticism has been placed on the sex scenes (or rather, the chopped and butchered ones in the R rated cut). Again, I felt the same way the first time I saw the movie. But I was wrong. People are viewing the sex through the lens of the first movie. The first movie's view of sex was very titillating and very much told from a soft-core-porn-cable-male point of view. It was so choreographed and so overdone. It worked brilliantly for the first movie. The sex in the second one is completely different. It's much more realistically done. It is not as staged. Also the sex in the sequel is, like the rest of the move, dark and violent and disturbing. That doesn't mean that it's not hot; it just means that the sex in the sequel is used for a completely purpose. Every sex scene has a very specific purpose and that is control and/or manipulation.To be sure the first movie has sequences that can't be beat: Johnny's death; interrogation scene; the club scene, but the sequel isn't trying to one-up the first movie. It stands by itself. It's a completely different feel and angle. But the sequel has its own great moments as well: the scene where she straddles the chair in his office; threesome scene was hot and a great example of her power over him; the Jacuzzi; Milena's apartment. But especially the ending! It was far much more satisfying than the original. Evil, dark, and uncompromising, the ending was awesome.People are condemning this movie for reasons that go far beyond tastes and preferences. They really seem to be punishing this movie for its existence. They are also not comfortable with a woman being that unapologetic about her sexuality. Also, Sharon's age is being repeatedly attacked and used as a negative slant. That's just stupid and indefensible. We should celebrate age and sexuality. Condemning them just shows how ignorant and pathetic the purview of this country has become.I do agree that the timing of the release was very poorly chosen. This just isn't the market for erotic thrillers or for a more serious frank view of sex, period. It's a really safe time for movies. No one's really taking chances. And Brokeback Mountain doesn't count! I loved it, but it was defiantly very carefully done. It wasn't really all that envelope pushing. The fact that people think the idea of two men falling in love as ""radical"" or ""envelope pushing"" or ""new"" should probably stick their heads back in the sand.If this movie had been released in a less restrictive time, it would have done better. It certainly wouldn't have been as vilified as it has been. Further more; the MPAA wouldn't have felt the need to cut the thing to all hell. It is an excellent sequel. It deserves far better treatment than it is receiving. It's really a shame actually, and it's also very telling of major issues within our overly judgmental and uneducated culture.If for some odd reason Sharon Stone, ot some one from her team reads this review, I have seen ""Basic Instinct 2"" three times now. The second and third times I saw the movie with two different people, and they were totally surprised at how good the movie was and how much they really enjoyed it. They were also equally surprised at how unmerited and how cruel the reception for this movie was. And whatever each of our issues were with the movie, we all agreed on one thing - your portrayal of Catherine was everything that we had hoped for and more!",Basic Instinct 2
175,vamp-07,"GET REAL PEOPLE,watch it first.",5,17 February 2007,"LESS MAJESTIC than it's predecessor,BI2 came out 14 years later,and the waiting made the audience's expectations grow enormously,and in the meantime,Sharon reached 40..the N0-NO age-to-be in Hollywood. Even before it was released,BI2 was hued by the critics=the audience. Audiences going to see BI2 already know who and what Catherine is,unlike in the first part where we had to find the identity of the killer and i think that BI2 should've taken us into an immersion of Catherine's private world,instead it's an exact replica of the first BI,with less suspense and much less screen magic. The direction by Michael caton-jones is doubty and really fails to grip ur attention.Too bad cause Catherine's superb character is somewhat wasted by mediocre direction and screenplay.. u can even sense that Catherine in BI2 is a bit over the top,and we don't see any of that brilliant passionate evil yet vulnerable persona,instead she's dry and plastic but her manipulation is so delicious. SO, BI2 doesn't live up to the standard of the first part, but it's not bad either.could have been great with better direction.",Basic Instinct 2
176,AVeryAptPupil,Give it a chance...It'll grow on you,8,11 April 2007,"On the day that this movie was released into theaters, a not-so-well known critic said that it ""came up all wet"". He said that the rest of the movie was good, but Sharon Stone's performance was less than desirable. Was it because she was an older woman getting the younger boys? Or was it because he expected her to soften up and act sweet? Perhaps I'll never know.Anyway, it's a sequel; so of course it's not going to be as awesome as the original. Few sequels are. Now that that's out of the way...The story line is tight, daring, and suspenseful. The acting is great. The music is incredible. The character Catherine Trammel is back to doing what she does best, which is toying with people's minds and luring them to their doom while she writes lurid and incredible books about it.Some critics, and people in general, should hold judgment until they really look at what they're critiquing. This movie still might not appeal to some people, but it is definitely worth a view. I'll certainly be watching for the next Basic Instinct film.",Basic Instinct 2

The setting was also fabulous and the whole atmosphere of the movie was that mysterious,thriller like masterpiece.

178,fennis2000,"A good thriller, unjustly panned",10,11 July 2006,"Basic Instinct 2 is a film people were prepared to slam from the moment filming commenced... rarely had a project raised such ire among critics, many of whom didn't even wait to see the movie before getting out their claws! I guess something about an older woman playing a sexy killer bothers American movie-goers, if you're over 30 and a woman you are past your expiration date, it seems. Sharon Stone seemed to incur most of the wrath - how dare she try to be a sexual icon at her age? Who does she think she is? Obviously she is desperate for money!It didn't matter that none of this was true, the film going public largely stayed away from BI2, and it was a sad thing, since it was a fun, sexy murder-mystery with lots of twists and turns. Beautifully shot, it even adds a touch of class with it's glamorous London setting and bona-fide actors like Charlotte Rampling and David Thewlis. If I've any complaint, it's that the film was too reserved, not going far enough in terms of sexual situations, and bizarrely blurring over the lesbian plot line. The opening car-crash masturbation scene is brilliant, and should have set the tone for what followed, but instead the film is a rather prim affair, considering the first film.Speaking of which, since when did the first Basic Instinct become a cinema classic? If you remember, the critics also slashed the neo-noir to bits with their pens, and indeed, it WAS a tawdry campy affair... BI2 is a step up in terms of acting and storyline, if only the director had taken the violence and sex up a notch as well",Basic Instinct 2
179,lfca1,BASICally should have followed my INSTINCTs.....,1,31 March 2006,".....and stayed away. This movie was like a really, really, bad parody of itself. Where to begin? Sharon Stone. She looks ""good"" for her age.......the last three words are imperative to follow the first three. Never once did her highly BOTOX-ed brow move. She was angry? Nothing. She was smiling? Nada. And the sneer! Too much. Her constant monotone delivery did nothing to help the audience stay awake- and I noticed 3 movie goers dozing in my area within the first 45 minutes! David Morrissey wasn't much better. His weak, sniveling character was totally implausible for a shrink. (She WASN'T ""all that""!!) Michael Douglas, he ain't! And speaking of Michael Douglas....they sure paid homage to the absent -but sorely needed actor: Shrink's name? Michael. Stone's name? Catherine. And the shrink was trying to earn the ""Douglas"" award. In a better script, with better actors, it could have allowed for some comic relief, but near the end of the movie when one character emits an overly-long anguished scream, I found myself, with the rest of the audience, wishing I could do the same aloud, instead of inwardly. Sharon, PLEASE, I beg of you, if they come around (which is doubtful) with BI-3, ""Just say NO!"" You're already too long in the tooth to play the original seductress. Everyone was laughing at you! Minus one star from me! This was an abominable waste of time and money. It's destined to be a 2 week (max) runner.....PS It's now 4/22, and apparently I was right.

Maybe it's because I myself am ten years older than she is, but she looks pretty good to me. No, the problems with this film are the plot (absurd and, worse, unbelievable) and the acting (especially the ""analyst"", though it's not entirely his fault, given the silly things he has to do and say.) The first film had an almost equally improbable plot, but somehow you could suspend your disbelief for the time it took to watch the movie. I think it had to do largely with the chemistry between the two leads, which seems to be utterly lacking here. I just can't believe the psychiatrist is THAT obsessed with Catherine, whereas in the first movie the cop's obsession felt very real.

183,brushfirerecordsaddict,"Not THAT bad, but far from being great",4,5 April 2006,"It seems fashionable to hate this movie, put the blame on Sharon Stone and try everything to throw this movie into the ""Bottom 100"" slot. I will try my best to judge this movie decently.First of all, the question we all wanted this movie to answer: Is Sharon Stone still as hot as she was 14 years ago? The answer must be Yes. Stone still does look radiant, thanks to plastic surgery, good make-up artists, sexy dresses and -- in her (very few) sex scenes -- body doubles.Is Stone convincing in her part of Catherine Tramell? Sure she is. Stone is one of the best (and most underrated) actresses in Hollywood. She did great in part one, and she did a convincing job in the sequel. After 14 years of preparation, she knows Catherine Tramell inside out.What did I like about this movie? First of all, I was thrilled to see Charlotte Rampling again. She is one of the most beautiful women in the world (still!), and she does fine in her part. I pity that she hasn't got more scenes. There were several supporting actors who made this movie worth watching: Indira Varma, David Thewlis, Hugh Dancy, Heathcote Williams, Kata Dobó. Sad thing that each of them only has three scenes or even less. (If you look closely, you can briefly spot André Schneider from ""Deed Poll"" as an extra at the police station.) The movie looks cool and stylish, but after all this is a big budget movie, so I do expect good editing, fine photography and art direction. With a budget of about 80 million dollars, one CAN expect a good-looking movie, I think.The weakest spot of ""Basic Instinct 2"" is David Morrissey who has to carry the movie. (He's got more scenes than Stone, and the story is told from his point of view, after all.) He's an accomplished stage actor, and he's made some good movie appearances (i.e. in ""Drowning by Numbers"" or ""The Suicide Club""), but this was certainly one of his bleakest ones. He just couldn't deal with the part, sometimes he's unintentionally funny, especially in the end when he's become crazy.The script. My oh my! The first draft was finished in the late 1990s, and they kept re-writing and re-writing it over and over and over. Michael Caton-Jones, who made ""City by the Sea"" and ""Shooting Dogs"", two little masterpieces, stated that he had to change it practically every day while they were already filming because it just didn't work. In the end, ""Basic Instinct 2"" is overlong, and it tries to surprise the audience so much that it gets ridiculously boring. In the end, you just don't care anymore whether Catherine did it or not. The script alone would have sufficed for a made-for-TV mystery, but...There are some things about Miss Stone's make-up. She IS hot. She has aged damn well. She's almost 50 and looks like 42. By trying to make her look like 25, they kind of made her face look like wax. Why?",Basic Instinct 2
184,michaelm1979,The Best Belated Sequel One Could Ask For,10,9 April 2006,"I saw the original ""Basic Instinct"" when I was 13 years old and thought it was absolutely fantastic with a slam bang ending. The sequel ""Basic Instinct 2: Risk Addiction"" is surprisingly well done with a lot of plot twists that I would not dare give away. ***(POSSIBLE SPOILERS)*** Sharon Stone gracefully steps back into the shoes of cinema's most notorious female vixen Catherine Tramell. The film opens with a smash, and as the result of the death of a sports star, Catherine Tramell is once again the prime suspect in a murder. She is, as we all know, diagnosed with what Dr. Michael Glass calls a 'Risk Addiction', a need to prove to herself and others that she is basically invincible. The story carries out with great dialogue and Catherine speaks as freely as she always has. Like Detective Nick Curran in the original, Dr. Glass is entranced in her web of lies and seduction, meanwhile taken into the seedy undergrounds of sex and violence. David Morrissey is perfect for this role. Unlike most sequels, this manages to be unique, rather than attempting to imitate the first film. There are some obvious homages, but nothing over the top. Catherine Tramell is brilliant and masters her ways of manipulation stonger than ever. This film helps fans of the original understand her character better. Michael Caton-Jones (""Scandal"") is a man of genius by taking risks and directing something from an old formula and making it fresh again. John Murphy, the composer does the film justice by reinventing the Jerry Goldsmith theme from the original, which is one of the best scores in Hollywood history. All actors are brilliant and the cinematography is breath-taking. If you liked the original and are willing to see something different than most sequels, I urge you to go and see this film.

Thumbs up (ignor the haters). If you like Sharon Stone, you must watch this movie. YES, she's older, but she still smolders, like only Stone can. Lets face it, there are few actresses that can exude the Sexuality and confidence of Stone. With her Crystal clear piercing blue eyes that sit inside a perfectly symmetrical face. The Tall lanky body frame that she works, Sharon can still put on a show (and she's actually a good actress too). Hard to take your eyes off Stone and she commands the plot and stage through-out the movie (the other actors are good too).

For all the hype and curiosity that was ingrained in me after watching all those Sharon-Stone-interrogation slapsticks, the movie completely failed to make me like it. Yes, she's still hot though she's technically old (a MILF for that reason) and the sight of her boobs makes one think ""natural or synthetic?"" However not even the best sexual connotations and denotations can save Basic Instinct 2 from bordering in the A-/B movie territory.

I bet most people inside the theater basically went in just to see how Sharon Stone would look like in the role that made her famous a decade or so after. Sure, Sharon Stone is still in the league of Demi Moore, but who really cares? I guess this is what you get for watching 2 movies in a row just for the sake of doing something. I want my money back!http://kingdelrosario.wordpress.com/2006/04/01/back-to-basics/",Basic Instinct 2
187,vinish777,Spoiler movie but great sex,6,17 May 2006,"Now the movie did manage to raise a lot of heat during its release using Sharon Stone as the ""venture catalyst"" but somehow,Michael Caton Jones failed to deliver that degree of brilliance and trill that he promised his audience through the trailers of B I 2.Insted it turned out to be something like watching soft-porn on the big screen! Stone is a risk addict who loves taking risk and in turn falls for the detective that we do not realize until the last scene in the movie.It may be slow and dragging,but what may keep you through the movie will definitely be naked women and the sex scenes. So watch the movie only if have the live action urge in u else chuck it!! A treacherous 3 out of 10 for the story and the movie but an extra 3 for the sex.",Basic Instinct 2
188,maxpower03,"Not the worst movie ever, but still a lazy and generic thriller",4,31 May 2010,"Catherine Tramell, Sharon Stone's icy, bisexual murder suspect from the classic '90s thriller Basic Instinct, is now living in London, where she undergoes therapy with a respected criminal psychologist (David Morrissey). Dr Michael Glass diagnoses Catherine as a sufferer of ""risk addiction"", while at the same time growing obsessed with his mysterious patient, who may be responsible for a series of murders.Sharon Stone's sex appeal does not translate in this belated sequel. Don't get me wrong, this is not due to her age, but more the fact that she appears to be trying too hard to appear sexy. While the original film wrote Catherine as a manipulative, icy and irresistible temptress, similar characterization is ignored here, leaving Stone to stand around in revealing outfits and recite embarrassingly graphic dialogue. Then there's the constant filter on her face, as well as the volley-ball breast implants positioned so far apart that you can practically drive a car through her cleavage. If the film didn't go so far out of its way to make her appear young, she just might have gotten away with it.The murder plot treads similar ground as the first film, even down to the positioning of the bodies (naked man in bed, somebody bleeding to death in a closed room). But unlike the original, the writers don't utilize Catherine's possible guilt well enough. Something about the whole character is phony, and she's definitely not the same woman we were introduced to in 1992. Despite her top billing, Stone disappears for long periods of time, leaving David Morrissey (adequate, but no Michael Douglas) to put the clues together and reach some kind of conclusion to the mystery.Strangely for a movie claiming to be an erotic thriller, scenes of a sexual nature are few and far between. Even a trip to a sleazy London orgy comes off less as an arousing thrill and more pretty depressing, seeing Catherine reduced to underground bars and back-alleys to get her kicks. But, thinking about it, I guess that was what they were trying to do with the whole ""risk addiction"" thing.In the end, Basic Instinct 2 is pretty desperate. Sharon Stone appears desperate to prove she is an attractive 40-something, the script features dialogue that doesn't even reach Joe Esterhazs quality, and the amount of phallic imagery (key-chain trinkets, giant penis buildings...) is pretty damn hilarious. When a trashy thriller like this fails in terms of both erotic thrills and genuine mystery, you know there's something seriously wrong.Rating: D",Basic Instinct 2
189,Seaman2223,Good movie!!!,7,2 May 2006,"I don't know why many people have reviewed this movie as awful, I didn't pay attention to those review and I saw the movie lat night and it worth the price of the ticket. Sharon Stone's acting is great. One of the best Femme Fatale. She is in the 40's and still look hot. Great face and body. The history is good and, the acting is great, I would to see Sharon Stone. I think that the problem with the movies was that they last too long to film it, more then a decade. I would like to see a 3er part if there are plans of filming it.I recommend this movie. Don't pay attention to the review and see it. And try to make your own point of view.I give it 7/10.",Basic Instinct 2
190,cranberry-1,pretty good movie,7,15 January 2007,"It was entertaining and suspenseful. Unfortunately too many disappointed commenters expected it to be a sequel to Basic Instinct, but it almost has nothing in common. I thought it was a sexy mystery that kept me interested the entire movie. It is for mature audiences that can appreciate some levity and artistic excess libido. Sharon Stone, while older is still hot for her age. The phallic shaped building in London (real building) symbolizes the real and surreal setting for the real and surreal relationships that Catherine has. The unconvincing opening scene with the car careening out of control could have been rewritten and re shot, but that can be said of most movies. It was a pretty good movie that I would watch again.",Basic Instinct 2
191,spaceodds,Tongue-in-cheek,7,9 April 2006,"Basic Instinct 2 it an appalling and atrocious film. It has some of the worst dialogue ever put on screen, and it loses all the sexuality the first one built its legacy on. However one of the things this film offers is pure entertainment and it delivers it in spades. As an audience I knew this film would be bad, but I never expected to be actually entertained by its with its tongue-in-cheek humour and shameful story. Stone again shows that she's still sexy, and I personally think that some of her scenes were brutally cut. David Morresey fulfilled his duties as a leading man very well. Dr. Glass was a far more interesting male lead than Nick Curren(Michael Douglas) and with Morresey adding a dark edge to his character.Leave your snobbish critical egos at home and go and see this just for the fun of it all.",Basic Instinct 2
192,danieljamesb,Not THAT bad but not nearly as good as the original,4,9 April 2006,"A lot of people are tearing up this film. Although I didn't think it was a great, I didn't think it should be thrown into the same bin as Gigli.The movie is somewhat predictably unpredictable which is either a good or a bad thing. Sharon Stone does a good job bringing her character back to life although the performance seemed somewhat repetitive.The thing this movie did best was building up sexual tension between characters. From beginning to end you could cut the tension with a knife. Very real and raw, even with the acting being sub-par.I was moderately entertained, yet I did look at my watch a few times. I am by no means saying this is a great film, but if your looking for something risky, sexual, raw, entertaining at times, and completely different than whats out there, then this is the movie to see.",Basic Instinct 2
193,vancoolguy,not as good as the first one,5,20 December 2006,"Catherine Tramell, as depicted in this sequel, is slightly different from the predecessor. I guess I would say that she appeared more straight than bisexual, far more slutty with definite loss of her soft innocent charms. It definitely did not live up to my expectations of the Catherine I knew from BI 1 who was charming, intelligent, sexual and at the same time soft and innocent. The group sex scene was totally not necessary and I thought it was deliberately pushed into the movie to make it overtly sexual. The story line was neither so tight or suspenseful (not to mention confusing at places), nor filled with erotic tension as we have seen in BI 1. Still I think the writers were successful in making the story just as open ended as in the first one with spectators left guessing on who the real murderer was! Also I think the film has some provocative dialogs from Catherine which was fun to watch too.The only positive side that I see in the movie is David Morrissey's acting as Dr. Glass. I think he did a great job, perhaps better than Douglas as Curran. Oh BTW, we get to know that inspector Curran was murdered in between BI 1 and BI 2, ""his girlfriend did it"". Honestly, I really felt bad to hear Douglass' this sad destiny.Overall, I would say that the writer and the directors (the fact that they were not the same as the ones who made BI 1 were pretty obvious in the whole movie) were probably more carried away in making BI 2 a soft porn movie than an erotic thriller with a suspenseful and entertaining storyline. If you do like soft porn stuff, go ahead and see the movie and forget about what you had known from the BI 1 days. Just another effort in making a successful sequel gone waste.",Basic Instinct 2
194,maryasha_lubelska,Michael Douglas was 48 in Basic Instinct 1,7,13 September 2006,"Perhaps my maths is out, but as Michael Douglas was born in 1944 that means he must have been 48 in 1992, the same age or maybe a couple of years older than Stone in Basic Instinct 2. The difference is that Michael Douglas was really ugly in 1992, while Sharon Stone still looks pretty good to me. When BI 1 came out, it was almost universally panned - I remember when my friends came back from the cinema they were saying things like, ""The plot makes no sense"" ""Michael Douglas is just so ugly"" ""they've got a psychiatrist who wears glasses to look clever,"" and ""the dialogue is so lame and flat it's unbelievable."" Then a lot of bisexuals started to complain about BI and no one could see why anyone would bother to complain about such a movie. Then it seemed to capture the public imagination, in a way that Basic Instinct two will never be able to do - we've moved on as a culture and we expect more.BI2 is just as enjoyable as the first movie. Yes, it's corny and implausible in every way, and the dialogue is just as silly. The London setting made a good backdrop for the action. It would perhaps have been better to make BI2 about five years after the first movie, instead of fourteen years later, but this way we get to see Stone as a veteran seductress of the witch variety, which I think is the way her character would develop in the fourteen year gap between movies.",Basic Instinct 2
195,dware86-1,"seriously underrated, very intelligent film",9,9 March 2012,"I cannot believe all of the seriously negative reviews of this film. I cannot afford to write a lengthy review as I am in the process of a dissertation, but from the off, I must offer that my opinion is that this film surpasses the original.People have mentioned how predictable the film is, how 'past it' Sharon Stone is, yet I couldn't disagree more. I love the idea that it continues from the same character, the idea that she hasn't changed her colours, and is, if anything more intelligent and manipulative than before. She looks great for her age and although that sounds a cop-out, I think she is perfect for the character, just because we as audiences are constantly bombarded with the youngest and skinniest and hottest girls that society tells us we should find attractive, doesn't mean that she doesn't hold her own, the target audience encompasses a slightly older age group. You don't watch this as from a lusty caveman perspective, go watch Porn for that, this is a thrilling psycho-sexual ride, playing on the psychology of manipulations of lust and desire. It shows that even the best of us, still have the aforementioned caveman lusts, but intermixed with intelligence and cunning so true of life. It kept me guessing until the end, even then shocking me with not knowing what was actually the truth as it did with the characters. I thought a very intelligent film, worthy of its name.",Basic Instinct 2

What a fine line a middle-aged woman must walk to be accepted! The movie was finely made and tension is well sustained throughout. Sharon Stone's acting cannot be called excellent, but it is nowhere close to being bad. She is sexy and seductive. Too bad we don't see enough of her (as we did in BI1) in the movie.Disregard all the negative comments and see it for yourself. There are thousands of ways you can worse spend five dollars and two hours of your time.",Basic Instinct 2
197,thebuddhadharma,As fun as the original....,10,2 April 2006,"If you enjoyed the original you'll definitely enjoy this one also. I saw it with friends opening day...apparently we were the only ones who saw it opening weekend according to what it made money-wise, nonetheless...all of us enjoyed it a lot. Sharon Stone has this character down pat and it's obviously her best role. I think that had it been marketed better...I believe I saw maybe one very short commercial for it before the opening date, it would have made more money. Also it opened against a kids film, Ice Age 2, which is never good for an R rated film. I highly recommend you see it at the theater, but if you must wait, definitely buy the DVD when it comes out, as it will surely have an unrated version, which will be hotter than what I saw I'm sure. Sharon Stone looks wonderful (better than 14 years ago if that's possible) and the whole cast, and local (London) is superb!",Basic Instinct 2

I think that the very low grade it received is very unfair. I hope to see part three :).Since I am not native English is hard for me to write in this language and I really don't want to say more besides I already said : the movie is really good, go and see it and I am sure you will not regret it.

199,popculturejunkie85,An underrated camp classic!!,7,31 August 2008,"When I first saw the trailer for this film, I must admit I was really excited. It looked sexy, stylish and suspenseful and I eagerly was looking forward to seeing Catherine Tramell back on the big screen. Before I actually saw the film I read the very unkind reviews which prejudiced my mindset before seeing it. When I actually did see it I wasn't all that impressed, and I left the theater feeling very confused as to what made sense. The ending unnecesarily throws you for a loop.However, I really began to appreciate this movie once I picked up the DVD. Yes, I have frequently watched this movie! The movie has a lot of good going for it. it looks fantastic. Very modern and sleek with a very good original score with additional usage of the original score from the first one. I love the music used while Dr. Glass is waiting for Tramell at his office.The sets are really impressive. This was not a cheep movie. Dr. Glass's office is the centerpiece of the film. It's so unrealistic and over the top but adds so much to the scenes and feel of the film. Catherine Tramells apartment is also impressive. A dark hidden lair of sexuality for a cougar on the prowl.The cinematography is truly gorgeous. This is the best part of the movie. Every shot of London looks so beautiful and contemporary. The costumes Sharon Stone wears are very eye catching and risqué and are eye candy the viewer.The film most definitely qualifies for the ""so bad its good category."" There are truly campy lines, most of which go to Stone. I cant possibly list all of them, but its really funny stuff. ""Even Oedipus didn't see his mother commin"", Watching the film makes you wish Joan Crawford was still making movies!! The only complaint I had with the movie is the ending. that last ""final Twist"" was so unnecessary and totally confuses the viewer. The director says he did that to make the viewer think and to leave it ambiguous. The whole movie makes you think and leaves you a bit confused, so an ending that reveals the true killer and explained the missing pieces would have helped bring some things into focus. All I can say is watch the film with the mindset that Tramell IS the killer and you will have a good time and it will make sense. And think of the ending as Tramel's final mind F*CK with Dr. Glass.Rent it and watch it a few times! happy camping!!",Basic Instinct 2
200,Jay_Vonne,basic instinct 2:risk addiction is a good film :),8,17 November 2006,"Fistly, I understand that this film did not live up to the sequel but hey, how many films do? There was no need for the amount of criticism the film received, at the end of the day there are many features in this film that were similar to the original for starters Catherin tramell is back, and has not changed a bit, still as sexy as ever. However the down play of her sexuality was a mistake because sex is her weapon in these films, it was kind of like watching a horror slasher film without any stabbing. But still that was the BBFC's fault because the sexual scenes were made just not shown, there was nothing the director or actors could do about that, so holding a grudge against the film for that I feel would be pointless, however from reading an interview I found that they are planning to release the REAL uncut DVD. Secondly the male protagonist is still annoying and thinks he knows it all like Micheal Douglas in the first. But most importantly the ambiguity and mystery that confuses the audience is still there, I think that critiques have to understand that it would have been difficult to match the suspense of the first film because the audience is now familiar with Cathrine tramell and what she does so it may appear repetitive but I feel it's not. The clever word play and sexual innuendo's are still there but of a higher standard, I feel this is to compensate for the lack of sex in comparison to the first. Sharon stone once again lived up to HER role as Cathrine tramell perfectly and the acting of the others was fantastic. I feel that you should what this film first then make a judgement rather than listening to the critics, it was a long awaited sequel starring the seductive goddess Miss Stone and the film did all it could to entertain. I would recommend watching the film, it was excellent.",Basic Instinct 2
201,adrian-stern-1,I loved it!,8,1 January 2012,It seems hard to understand the criticisms of those who disliked this film. Perhaps they are not comfortable with older female stars or English actors it's hard to tell. Sharon Stone was fascinating to watch in the film and still as desirable as ever. David Morrisey always out acts everything Michael Douglas has ever done - perhaps I just don't like him but am enamoured of Morriseys performances; for American viewers - he's very well known in the UK and greatly admired. Charlotte Rampling's rôle was too small as she too is an actress fascinating to watch; all three took big chances in their rôle playing and I was entertained from start to finish. Loved it! In fact far more than BI1!,Basic Instinct 2
202,MacLovesMoon,It's Clear Some People Are Out To Get This Movie,8,5 April 2006,"I think the reason for all the opinionated diarrhea on this movie is that most people have it out for Sharon Stone being around 50 and getting naked while playing sexy. No one cared when the Golden Girls sat around eating cheesecake and discussing their first orgasm, but to see someone post menopausal getting digitally pleased while driving I guess is just too much for some to handle. Let's face it, she looks good, she's light years hotter than my mother who's the same age! It's not an Oscar or a cult classic like the first, but ever since the turn of the century that's all movie goers seem to expect: a cinematic experience that will touch your soul. As such, it never claims to be either. It's an erotic thriller that is both erotic and thrilling, and is a continuation of a brilliant character that we all love to hate. It's the character of Catherine Trammell that helped give way for this sequel. Fans of the first movie want to see more of that frosty ice queen.The cinematography and art direction were lush and extravagant and made me want to move to Britian for sure. The score is amazing as well.Sure there's some overacting from some characters but there's some brilliant work from David Morrissey who's virtually unknown.There's a setback in that the script is virtually the same as the first movie only plugging in a psychiatrist in place of the cop. As well as the criminal decision of the MPAA to force the movie to be cut down even more which takes away from the guilty-pleasure raunchiness that the story is known for.At the very least it's entertaining and fun to look at it, and that's the movie's only intentions. So if you've got beef with Mizz Stone, maybe you should actually SEE the movie and draw your own conclusions before you spew forth your projectile vomit?",Basic Instinct 2
203,Steven_H,Has all the ingredients of a good thriller...,9,22 March 2006,"...that's exactly what this is: a thriller. It's not supposed to sweep the Oscars, the acting isn't supposed to be perfect, and it's not supposed to make perfect sense.The story follows our beloved psycho Catherine Tramell, who's once again under investigation for murder. The psychiatrist who's after her is taught and trained to become her love-slave (in a very comedic scene). After that, a whole lot goes wrong.I loved this movie, and I hate how everyone's been calling it 'mindless nudity'. It's not mindless, it's actually very dramatic. The acting is great from pretty much all accounts, even Sharon Stone does a good job.David Morrissey captures the 'reluctant hero' role, and Charlotte Rampling does well as his friend. David Thewlis delivers a great comedic performance as the genius who goes insane once the killing starts.Great, funny, intense, dramatic movie. 9/10.",Basic Instinct 2
204,petertommaatta-1,A solid thriller,9,18 February 2010,"I'm sorry, but I have to declare that this movie kicked ass. You can't go into this movie after seeing ""Capote"" or ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" or something and think that this will compare with those Oscar caliber projects. It's not meant to. This is a sequel to the 1992 sexual thriller and is meant to be nothing else. And it's a damn good one.If this were to have been made back in the mid 1990's, immediately after the original, it would have been consider a big hit and the critics wouldn't have bashed it (as badly). Unfortunately for this sequel, it came out about 10 or more years too late. This kind of movie just doesn't appeal to mass audiences anymore. Those who flocked to the cinema back in '92, are at the age now, that they don't go to see movies in the theater, they wait for DVD.But, you can still watch the original ""Basic Instinct"" and appreciate how well it was written, directed and acted by those involved, even though, these kind of films don't bank at the box office now.I was one of the $6.8 million of domestic box office that went to see this when it came out and I bought it the day it was released on DVD. If you loved the original ""Basic Instinct"", or similar themed movies, then you'll at least like this sequel.If you don't love them, and just want to bash this kind of sexual thriller and called them ""dumb"", ""out of date"", ""silly"", or whatever, then there's no way you'll appreciate it.",Basic Instinct 2
205,rbsmith2000,"Twice as hot, but only for the thinking viewer",9,5 December 2006,"This sequel is way above the original, improving on some of the clumsier attempts at tense, wound sexuality. Sharon keeps getting hotter with age, cosmetic surgery notwithstanding. She's grown and evolved with the role, in the same way a real character would. Some won't get the layers of subtlety mixed with intensity, but maybe the more intense sex scenes will make up for that. Even the driving is up a couple of notches right down to the upgraded automotive technology. The screen play writers clearly used the original as a base, but the average viewer may not get that. It's too bad there isn't a guide to help the less cognizant with the parallels, metaphors and analogies. The extended version of the DVD heightens the experience. Don't look away or some nuggets will slip past you.",Basic Instinct 2
206,karl-mauk,A sequel that should have never been made!,1,30 March 2006,"In my book ""Basic Instinct"" was a perfect film. It had outstanding acting on the parts of Stone, Douglas and all the supporting actors to the tiniest role. It had marvelous photography, music and the noirest noir script ever. All of it adding up to a film that is as good as it will ever get!This sequel is the exact opposite, it cannot possibly get worse, bad acting and a lame script, combined with totally inept direction, this is really bad, boring, annoying. The only thing that somewhat keeps you concentrated is the relatively short wait for the next scene that is an exact re-enacted copy of the original. These copies are so bad they make you laugh and I laughed a lot in spite of myself, because it was like watching the demolishing of a shining monument. The only thing that is good in this horrible mess are the excerpts of the Jerry Goldsmith score of BI1. Michael Caton-Jones and the half-wit responsible for the script even included the ""There is no smoking in this room"" dialog in the interrogation scene and yes she sends her attorney (who is now a solicitor) away! I am sorry I have seen this awful film that should have never been made! It does damage to the original, so bad is it. The only redeeming value is the realization that cosmetic surgery (and I am sure Ms Stone afforded the best surgeon money can buy) can do a good job but can obviously not restore the perfection of the original. And what concerns the human body applies to film-making, too. There should be a law: Don't ever make a sequel to a perfect film!",Basic Instinct 2
207,thevoyces,"Life is ""2"" Short To Sit Through This",1,6 August 2006,"Maybe the first film was good. I don't know. I never saw it. All I know about the original 'Basic Instinct' is that all of its fame seems to come from one primary scene during which Sharon Stone flashes her vulva. Perhaps quite obviously, I sat down to watch the sequel hoping she'd hike her skirt again. Not even because I find her attractive, or need soft porn to get me by, but because due to all the hype I've often wondered if she had some kind of magical beaver or something. It would be difficult for me to write a cohesive review of BI2 due in large part to the fact that it was so boring from the opening credits that I stopped trying to pay attention to the plot almost right out of the chute. There are A LOT of faux-dramatic ""thinking"" shots. A lot of sweeping sound-asleep cityscape shots. Sharon tries with everything in her basically elderly body to convince viewers she is sexy. It is funny for a minute. Then sad. Then boring. Then funny again. Then boring for about an hour. Then sad for a spell. And then funny again. Then it's over.

It really does get you guessing and I found myself switching allegiances every five seconds. Unfortunately Sharon Stone really was too old to play the part of the femme fatal and she does not pull off sexy older woman at all well. She definitely looks like mutton dressed up as lamb. The psychiatrist part is well played and mostly believable, until the last segment of the movie when you feel like yelling at him to wise up. The detective part is also well played but then you wouldn't expect anything less from the talented David Thewlis. So, I have a few criticisms, but all in all, not a bad movie.",Basic Instinct 2

The twists are just devices that make no sense, and their explanations are weak.The acting was OK not great, The British actors do better than Stone though.I did like the first one it was sexy and kept you wondering ""Is she the Killer?"" This one made me think man when is this movie going to be over?If you going to see this movie hoping for a good thriller don't bother.

However, Stone was better than the supporting cast but still not as powerful as she could have been. I blame the writers for that. When you are making a movie like B.I.2 you have to have some elements in the second movie that were in the first one. What happened to the sex? Curran and Tramell made sex what it was on screen. In the second movie it was lacking. I know that there were scenes cut from the final movie that will appear in the DVD, but c'mon. I went to see it for the sex and gore that the first one had and I left the theatre not happy. Stone did a superb job with what she was given. The script was weak and needed about three more re-writes. Even though it was a marginal movie, it was not as bad as Cutthroat Island, Waterworld and Fialure to Launch.

This is beautiful an it deserves the best note : 10/10. Thanks to Gyulia Pados, the director of photography. I will never forget to mention the excellent music originally composed by Jerry Goldsmith and rearranged by John Murphy.Then, the story is a real mind game and a very sophisticated European film noir. It depends who you believe in an it could change your point of view. Everybody lies to everybody or do they say the truth ? Why ? This is the key factor to manipulate people thanks to a tortuous script (Cf Memento, Chrisopher Nolan, 2000).The acting is very good. David Morrissey is excellent, charismatic and he amazed me. Does Dr Glass try to understand and to educate Catherine ? Tricky and impossible. However, he will be riveted by her. Sharon Stone does not steal the show to her partners. Ms Tramell is more diabolical, mad, nuts, ill, pervert and less innocent. Catherine is even more seductive, more predatory, this is what we call a killer.If you loved the first movie, you will love this one even if this is a complete different movie : less action but more acerbic and hurtful retorts.",Basic Instinct 2

215,volvorottie,"Awful film, terrible acting, ludicrous storyline, nudity distracting",1,4 August 2006,"Horrendous film! Awful! Embarrassing for Sharon Stone, who clearly has had her share of plastic surgery despite claims otherwise. I don't care if she appears naked, that's her business. I don't think it's a form of feminism to bare it all at her age. If this had been a film intended to do anything other than appeal to the prurient interests in a segment of the audience, her nudity may have advanced the story line. Yet it didn't, as it came off as a 48 yr old woman trying to show off her enhanced assets. Not empowering, just humiliating!Sharon Stone is a one note wonder who's outlived her interesting period by a good ten years. The woman can NOT act her way out of a paper sack.She's basically so self-absorbed that every ""character"" she plays ends up being a thinly veiled version of herself. Evidently the woman is highly intelligent, but a monster to live with in real life. That comes across loud and clear in her acting. I've seen pretty much every movie she's been in in the last 2 decades and the lady simply doesn't have real acting chops. I'm including ""Casino"" in that assessment too. Why you may ask? Principally her ""acting"" consists of wooden delivery, devoid of emotions, wherein the viewer is constantly aware that Sharon Stone isn't buying the character's words either. This comes across in nearly all her more recent films. The woman has a total inability to portray any warmth whatsoever. She truly does seem like an ice queen. The sort of predatory, amoral witch that women hate and men are afraid of knowing but drooling over nonetheless. However ""seductive"" that trait may be, it's not acting.Another huge issue: overly beautiful women who are self aware of this trait. The problem is, when you're THAT beautiful, you know it. And you unconsciously, or consciously, telegraph that out to the audience. It's highly distracting to watch a beautiful woman go through what I think of as ""set pieces"" - they read the lines, they mimic the emotions but don't feel them as they're acting. This means they're still whomever they are in real life, barely concealed. Not all gorgeous actresses have this problem - Selma Hayek, Reese Witherspoon, Cate Blanchett, Kate Winslet - and others can disappear into a role.Actors like Julia Roberts, Michelle Pfeiffer, Sharon Stone - they can't disappear into any role. You always ""know"" it's them you're watching and you can't get into the story of the film because they lack the acting chops and lack the ability to be humble to the role in order to deliver the goods. The fact is, these 3 in particular, are more 'renowned' for their looks than the acting chops. Especially Julia Roberts, Oscar winning notwithstanding. She didn't deserve that - she was WAY better as a hooker in Pretty Woman, before she became ""self aware"", painfully I might add, of her own 'power and beauty'. Not good! The acting suffers tremendously.Acting well is Meryl Streep, Signourney Weaver, Francis McDormant, Geena Davis, Holly Hunter - and the list of women over 40 who're at the top of their game goes on. None one of these super talented actors needs to remove their clothing, show a surgically enhanced chest and spew filthy words in order to appear younger/edgier and hip. Stone needs to learn some humility and dignity but at her age, it's doubtful. She's an arrogant narcissist and it comes across in every single movie she makes. I can't stand her at this point. She needs to seriously go away.",Basic Instinct 2
216,herlenwein-1,Stone Cold Vanity.,2,31 March 2006,"It's hard to believe, after waiting 14 years, we wind up with this piece of cinematic garbage. The original was a high impact, dark thriller that achieved ""cult"" status demonstrating the fine art of cinema as directed by Paul Verhoeven. This film adds nothing, delivers nothing, and ultimately winds up in the big box of failed sequels.The opening sequence could have triggered an intriguing set of plot developments using a considerably talented and able cast. Unfortunately we are treated to a 90 minute dissertation in the self-indulgent life of Catherine Tramell... or is it Sharon Stone. Possibly a copulation of both.If the desire is too see a continuation of the sensually provocative stying of sex as in ""B.S.1"", forget it. You wind up with soft-porn boredom which ultimately upholds the old adage that a woman can be more alluring in clothes than out of them. It's interesting to note that the wonderful Charlotte Rampling was romping around in her skivvies, via the 1966 GEORGY GIRL, when Ms. Stone was only 8 years old. A very talented actress and quite adept at holding her own even here.If you're a true cinema fan then you must see this film and judge it using your own rating system. If not, you might as well wait for the DVD release in the ""rated"" version, ""unrated"" version, ""collectors"" edition, or ""ultimate"" version, and perhaps in another 14 years we will be saturated with news of ""Basic Instinct 3"" at which point Ms. Stone will be 62 years old and nobody will really care.",Basic Instinct 2

I mean, this has to be one of the most pointless follow ups to have come out of Hollywood in some time. The opening scene, which had a cameo of footballer Stan Collymore in, was ridiculous and to over the top to be believed. From then on i hate to admit i was actually quite intrigued as to see what the seductive Catherine would do next, and when, as was obvious, she would get sexually involved with her Therapist! The movie was full of flaws, the acting poor and the direction un- balanced, but thats if you go in to the cinema expecting it to be a decent follow up to the original. If you take it as a totally different movie, without comparison, then it is quite entertaining, with Sharon Stone proving she looks amazing at the age of 47!",Basic Instinct 2
218,porcelainbarbiedoll,Briljant movie,10,3 November 2006,Briljant movie... Far better plot than the first one. With great dialogs and superb psychological profiling. Sharon is a super-sexy version of Hannibal. And the mental cruelty is as fine to taste as was the maliciousness in Dangerous Liasons. When it did not have the success it deserved only proved to me that some critics are just no longer capable to recognizer a good thing when it bites them in the ass. I hope one day they will meet Catherine/Sharon and enjoy her psychopathy first hand. I'm sure she'll find a very creative way to use a pen! If you really want to enjoy your evening...

Sharon plays her part to the hilt, espcally in the last half hour when she seems to relish being evil. David Morrisey is excellent with strong support from Charlotte Rampling. The London location makes a great backdrop to the action.It stands up well as a companion to the original film.The only real problem I had was with the sex scene. I think they should have remained true to the original intention regarding the explicitness. They've cut a little too deep pandering to the ratings.

Sharon Stone does a great job and she still looks amazing. Because of the bad reviews I read I really didn't expect much and I was positively surprised. I think it's the same with every movie the original is always the best one, but in my opinion Basic Instinct 2 isn't that bad. I saw the movie with a few of my friends and we all were positively surprised. Sharon stone is a great actress and the kind of moody character she plays in Basic Instinct 2 suits her pretty good. But also David Morrisey did a great job. So all together I really enjoyed the movie.",Basic Instinct 2
221,moner-1,Can this be even worse than CATWOMAN with a grade of 2.9???,10,9 April 2006,"Some people think that this movie sucked because it took fourteen years to see the sequel on big screen, some of them think that it sucked because M. Douglas is not in it, some of them think that S. Stone stole the show and the other characters did nothing, some think that this time the director was no P. Verhoeven etc. etc. I do not agree with none of the above thoughts, Because:a. I watched this in theater I watched the first one DVD again and realized that everything including the dialogs, the tricks, the score, the twist of the plot and the suspense were kept as in the original and further more suspense was higher in BI2 most of the time. b. Why do we need M. Douglas in this one while most of us think that he already got murdered at the end of first Basic Instict. If he was in this sequel it would be the biggest space of the plot. D. Morissey playing an English psychiatrist the story take place in England and he was a typical an English guy and sure is that he can not be compared to an American playing in this role. I mean he is doing as best as he can. c. The success of the first movie was not because of P. Verhoeven it was S. Stone's great ability to make an influence on the audience leaving them with a thousands of question marks in their heads if she is the real villain or not. d. The ending of the first movie was quite simple with leaving only the killer's weapon under the bed . However in this one it keeps you thinking hours and hours after you leave the theatre.The twist at the end is really much better than the first one!!! e. The score is also suspenseful and much more effective than the one it was in the first movie with oriental mixes in it and a combination of the first movie's score.f. I want to ask anyone who is commenting on this with a meaningless and exaggerated negative reviews: why does it suck in only USA and not in European countries and all over the world???In short this movie is a good even more good sequel and can be one of the best of its kind.

It is not a three star one but it was entertaining. I thought Sharon did a great job playing a psychopath killer. I thought the movie revealed how vulnerable some men are to an attractive lady and how easily they can be manipulated by a beautiful lady. The movie theme is similar to the First Basic Instinct. The male lead was weak an unknown. I thought the detective did a good job of acting. I enjoyed the beginning of the movie and the ending. If you have high expectations for this movie you will be disappointed. If you like Sharon Stone,you will likely enjoy it. My friend and I agreed that it was not a great movie but we have seen worst.",Basic Instinct 2
223,jonplay,"Basically, an instinctively worthy sequel - with style.",8,2 March 2007,"I approached this film with a wide-open mind, expecting the worst. I had read discouraging critiques when first released, and also the current ""Painfully Bad"" IMDb comment. I was prepared to cut and run if it was as bad as the ratings and comments purported, having, as I do, scant tolerance for crap and slush. So, with low expectations, I was surprised to find how much I enjoyed it. I am still bewildered at how badly it has been received.In preparation, the previous night, I refreshed my experience of its predecessor, Basic Instinct (1992). Of course we know it is a classic, and so time has in no way jaded its impact. As a sequel, however, Basic Instinct 2 squares off just fine. I loved the flash beginning - swept us right in in good style. Being British and knowing London well, I felt comfortably at home in the film's setting. That was a good start.The scenes and sets were stunningly dazzling, crisp, contemporary, breathtaking and sensitively contrasted. In that respect I think Michael Caton-Jones demonstrated great skill and maturity. The photography was superb, and never failed to surprise and, as it must and did, carried the story beautifully. The story itself was intricate and sufficiently puzzling to keep one guessing and involved, echoing the theme and complexities of its earlier version. I think Caton-Jones did an excellent job of mimicking, rather than merely regurgitating, the distinctive chilly demure and sultry, enigmatic combativeness of the dialog and interactions. While it was nice to be reminded of some of the original one-liners that gave BI1 its zip and humor, there was no point where it seemed cheap or glib. Though we certainly could anticipate many of them, they served more to reassure than disappoint. There was nothing stale in their repetition since they were entirely consistent with, and helped to restore our connection with, the protagonists who uttered them. At worst, they were tongue-in-cheek in their predictability.Sharon Stone carried her role with consummate aplomb, fresh as a daisy and looking not a day older. I never tired of watching her face, or her body for that matter. Only at the very last scene (which I felt was quite redundant) did I feel the slightest twinge of dissatisfaction. Her counterpart, in the shape of David Morrissey, resonated well with his stiff upper lip and fragile professional kudos. It was a clever shift in scenario to cast her new adversarial paramour in the guise of a forensic psychologist. I absolutely loved the character of Detective Ferguson (Neil Maskell) - I guess we were meant to - as a much subtler element in the plot than any of Nick Curran's shambolic sidekicks.The sex was tasteful, powerful, believable and.. sexy. It fitted well into the rhythm and unfolding of the story, as it did formerly, with nothing gratuitous or too ridiculous. My girlfriend, with whom I watched both films, however, found David Morrissey's face and physique very ugly. It didn't bother me at all, which just shows how very personal these things are. We agreed that the photo in the toilet though, was a wOw.So what's been turning everyone off and giving it such a low rating? Beats me. Is it because it is too British -- no guns (except once), explosions, car chases, mayhem, destruction and heavy-handedness? You'll just have to find out for yourself, which I thoroughly recommend you to do.I would give this a 7.5, but since I can't, I'll bump it up to 8. The ridiculous and incomprehensible 3.7 deserves some counterbalancing, for sure.",Basic Instinct 2
224,bloodpuppy11,Why?,2,19 August 2006,"I suppose it's sort of like shooting fish in a barrel to point out that there is absolutely no reasonable justification for this movie's existence, but it seems as good a place as any to start. Some movies cry out for continuation, while others make you feel so close with the characters that you want to go back to them, to see them again. But ""Basic Instinct""? Huh? There's a lot wrong here, from the bad acting to the bad script to the absolute pointlessness of the film's existence, but the real problem is that the whole premise of the movie just doesn't work; specifically, the notion that Sharon Stone's character is so seductive that seemingly rational men will completely ruin their lives for an opportunity to get nice with her. This is, of course, the premise of ""Basic Instinct"", but there it worked; Sharon was mighty foxy and the Michael Douglas character seemed dumb enough to fall into her web.Here, Sharon is still looking pretty foxy, but her male foil (David Morrissey) seems substantially more intelligent (if horrifically boring); that he would fall into her games seems completely illogical and silly. Additionally, the ""seductive"" banter between Stone and Morrissey is so pithy and juvenile that it is hard to believe that he would somehow be aroused by it. In the first ""Basic Instinct"", stone may have portrayed a ""femme fatale"" in the classical sense, but here her character is little more than a caricature, floating by on bratty references to sex acts and flashes of thigh.Ultimately, I suppose this movie is no worse than any other B-grade erotic thriller, although its high profile release and the hype surrounding it ensured that it would be scrutinized in a way that movies like ""I Like To Play Games 2"" never are. Of course, a movie like this is much better when it is subject to no scrutiny at all, and if you can suspend disbelief and/or judgment, ""Basic Instinct 2"" has the potential to be a marginally enjoyable (if totally unnecessary) film; anyone who cannot is advised to skip this one.",Basic Instinct 2

227,wildchocolate,Loved it!,10,1 April 2006,"Sharon Stone is still as beautiful and sexy as she ever was. People who complain about the story line not well developed and all, that's because they went in the movie with the wrong expectations. This is not Mission Impossible or CSI. You cant expect this to movie to be action packed or with a great murder plot. This is Basic Instinct! The movie is focused on a hot seductive dangerous woman, very skilled at mind games. There is sex, there is murder, there's basic instinct.I loved this movie as much as I loved the first. this one is slower paste than the first, with more talking, more mind games. And scratching out Michael Douglas makes perfect sense. This movie is about Catherine Tremell, not Nick, it's about basic instincts, not love. So the man has to change for sure. And Douglas looks way too old to be in this movie. I mean he's 60!! Cant he even get it up? And do you seriously wanna a 60 yr old saggy man naked? Sharon Stone is 48 but she looks nothing like a 48 yr old woman.I loved Basic Instinct not because of the sex, or coz she gets naked. I love it because it's about a woman who is in control, and she uses sex as her power. She controls every one around her, she manipulates them and uses them for the sole purpose of her entertainment, for her story writing. It's not like those typical love stories where the woman, no matter how successful she is, she still needs love and all that crap. Here, Catherine Tramell is a cold blooded person, that's why she always wins, she always gets away with everything. No emotions attached. She plays the men, drives them insane, then completely destroys their lives. People around her knows she's dangerous but still lets themselves fall into her hands. If you didn't like the first Basic Instinct, don't bother watching this. If you are expecting a lot of sex, you'll be disappointed too. Afterall, this isn't porn. This sequel is like another chapter of Catherine Tramell's life.",Basic Instinct 2

If it hadn't been titled ""Basic Instinct 2"" I'm sure it would have been better received. But like most sequels, it could never live up to its predecessor. Nevertheless, the story is engaging, and the cityscape of London in which it was filmed -- an interesting mix of old and new London -- is a welcome relief to what we Americans usually see of the city.Sharon Stone is still incredibly sexy, not just for her age but for a woman of any age. She carries off this role quite well, at least in my mind as successfully as in the first movie. The ending is a bit trite (and I won't spoil it here), but if you go into the movie just looking for an entertaining evening with some lovely eye candy, it can be an enjoyable experience for you.",Basic Instinct 2
229,SwimSuz,Stone-Cold Terrible. 'Basic Instinct 2' nothing more than a vanity project,2,2 April 2006,"There are two purposes for making a sequel: a) it was planned already, even during the original's filming and/or b) hoping to bank on the success of the original. Also, it's usually done within a reasonable amount of timesay 5 years. Basic Instinct 2 boils down to nothing more than a poorly written vanity project for Sharon Stone. Not to mention the original Basic Instinct was 14 years ago, leaving little interest for a sequel in the first place.Now in London, ice-pick wielding novelist Catherine Tramell (Stone) is back and she's in trouble with the law again. And of course, any man who crosses her path is walking the dangerous ground of falling under her spell.The plot of Basic Instinct 2 is too similar to the original: simply transplanting Catherine from San Francisco to London and replacing detective Nick Curran (Michael Douglas) with psychiatrist Dr. Michael Glass (David Morrissey) as the latest in her game of deadly psychotic seduction. The ideas are nothing new. She's still battling that murderous and insatiable sexual appetite, and she's still getting any with it.There's no doubt Sharon Stone knows how to play Catherine Tramell. She can capture the icy seductress with ease, mixing intoxicating sex appeal with deadly intelligence. However, with sloppy dialogue and the inferior pairing with Morrissey, BI2 just comes off pointless. Morrissey provides little in his role, using one facial expression throughout the entire filmI think his furrowed brow must be permanently fixed.The majority of the movie is just a vain showcase for Stonewho wants to show that at 48, she's still hot. If that's the purpose, I think she could have waited for a better projectI mean, for 48, she is in great shape.The new writing team of Leora Barish and Henry Bean create a script that fails to capture the provocative nature and characters originally created by Joe Eszterhas with no shred of respectable dialogue. There's an obvious struggle to create some sort of memorable line, all of which are terribly calculated. Maybe if the script was written over a few months rather than the thrown-together sound of it, this sequel might have been something. But that's a big maybe.This time around, the haunting direction of Paul Verhoeven is severely missed. Verhoeven was able to capture mesmerizing characters in a tale of seduction and manipulation. Along with the inferior script, the new direction of Michael Caton-Jones falls short of the original, providing little interest in the characters producing nothing more than a terrible film.The sex scenes in the original made sense to the plot; the sex scenes in the sequel are simply for shock value. Even then, they're more confusing than shocking. Including a completely necessary orgy sceneas I assume most all orgy scenes are. Personally, I like the original Basic Instinct. It's a genuinely good sexually-charged psychological thriller with a role tailor-made for Sharon Stone. The relationship between Douglas and Stone worked brilliantly, the dialogue was cuttingly vicious without force, and the graphic sex scenes worked with the plot.Poorly trying to relive the success of 1992 without the original director or writer ultimately causes Basic Instinct 2 to become one of the worst sequels ever to be made.Unless you have some uncontrollable need to see this movie, wait about a yearcheck the $5.99 bin and I bet you'll find it along with Weekend at Bernie's II and Out to Sea. That, or rent the original. At least it's a captivating thriller.1 out of 4 stars",Basic Instinct 2
230,smashsmack,"BI2. A beaten down horse without a fighting chance,",5,11 April 2006,"It has been over a decade since the original Basic Instinct was released and more resources have came along that provide easy access to information. Have these very resources caused more harm than people realize? Have people become stuck up and over-opinionated for their own good? In the recent years it seems to be pointed in that direction, some people are dependent on popular belief and with these new resources it can sometimes cause a negative reaction. More on this later, right now let's move onto the review.Basic Instinct 2 is the long-awaited sequel, at least by Sharon Stone, of a raunchy classic that was released back in 1992. Sharon Stone reprises her role as Catherine and once again finds herself mixed up in some trouble. After surviving a car crash, tragically leaving her momentary lover dead, Catherine is put to psychiatric care with one Dr. Michael Glass and is diagnosed with ""Risk Addiction."" After a very intimate session, more murders are taking place and Michale starts to gain an obsession over the might-be murderer. Is she really capable of such unspeakable acts? Is there someone else out there after her? Or are they after him.The plot is very basic indeed, if not a little exacerbated by me, but the movie really isn't as bad as everyone says it is. The suspense might not be high, the sexual tension isn't always there, but that doesn't mean the movie isn't interesting. The plot holds it's ground and can keep your attention if you don't try to take it all seriously. Despite what other people might say, Sharon Stone steals every scene she is in, no matter how over the top it may be. I guess we'll have to wait until the ""unrated"" DVD to be released to see all of the goods, which may be very shortly from the looks of it.Since the announcement of the movie, people have been trashing it before the production even began. Even the negative votes were coming in long before the movie was released, which is something IMDb really needs to fix, because how can people rate a movie that isn't even released? Most of the trashing is towards Sharon Stone, according to some once you hit over 45 you're not allowed to be sexy anymore. The fact is that Sharon Stone still is sexy and she can still deliver the goods she did over a decade ago. So what if she's up there? Let me see you at her age and try to pull off anything she did in this movie.It really seems that this movie didn't have a fighting chance, because now it seems to be a popular thing to not give anything a chance. Even when given a chance, a hard headed person will still trash something, despite them enjoying it. Which is why I gave this movie a 10, it really doesn't deserve it, but somebody has to bring some balance to the ever opinionated and biased world.",Basic Instinct 2
231,spykerdtc,Good movie unfairly bashed!,10,16 March 2009,"I just saw ""Basic Instinct 2"" again, and my opinion of the movie changed. Initially, I had a lot of issues with the movie. And then I read all of the negative press and reviews, and coupled with the awful box office, I really went in a second time with a much dimmer impression. But oddly, I very much came to love this sequel. I went back to see it looking through the lens that was created by all of the negative and vicious criticism. I went out of my way to pay attention to why people were saying this was one of the worst movies and/or sequels of all times, and I was very happy to realize that are all dead wrong. (Warning: some of this may contain slight spoilers) First, people are attacking Sharon Stone like she dressed up like the Prophet Mohammedand defecated on the screen. Her interpretation of Catherine is no different than it was in the first movie. She is SUPPOSED to be over the top. They did add a little more sarcasm to her character though, but it's because her position in the movie is different. This story definitely told from Catherine's P.O.V. She is purposely being a sarcastic and nasty and blatant about her machinations to see just how stupid these people really are. If you notice it's mostly directed towards Glass. It's a form of antagonizing him and making him angry enough to fight her, which is what she wanted. Catherine is much more exacting and evil in this sequel. I really enjoyed how much it fully exploited her character's potential.Also the costume designer Beatrix Aruna Pastor really did outstanding job with Catherine's unique look. It was very odd and very stylish. Nothing was off the rack or your typical designer trash, it was all very interesting and really helped convey Catherine's character.The screenplay is just as implausible as the first movie. It takes no more leaps in logic that the original. The same goes for the dialog. Actually the dialog is a little more restrained in the second one. Am I the only one who remembers: ""She's evil! She's brilliant!""? The acting in this one is also a lot more restrained. Michael Douglas wasn't all that subtle if you remember correctly.The sequel was darker and more focuses on the mind games than the first movie, which I prefer.A lot of criticism has been placed on the sex scenes (or rather, the chopped and butchered ones in the R rated cut). Again, I felt the same way the first time I saw the movie. But I was wrong. People are viewing the sex through the lens of the first movie. The first movie's view of sex was very titillating and very much told from a soft-core-porn-cable-male point of view. It was so choreographed and so overdone. It worked brilliantly for the first movie. The sex in the second one is completely different. It's much more realistically done. It is not as staged. Also the sex in the sequel is, like the rest of the move, dark and violent and disturbing. That doesn't mean that it's not hot; it just means that the sex in the sequel is used for a completely purpose. Every sex scene has a very specific purpose and that is control and/or manipulation.To be sure the first movie has sequences that can't be beat: Johnny's death; interrogation scene; the club scene, but the sequel isn't trying to one-up the first movie. It stands by itself. It's a completely different feel and angle. But the sequel has its own great moments as well: the scene where she straddles the chair in his office; threesome scene was hot and a great example of her power over him; the Jacuzzi; Milena's apartment. But especially the ending! It was far much more satisfying than the original. Evil, dark, and uncompromising, the ending was awesome.People are condemning this movie for reasons that go far beyond tastes and preferences. They really seem to be punishing this movie for its existence. They are also not comfortable with a woman being that unapologetic about her sexuality. Also, Sharon's age is being repeatedly attacked and used as a negative slant. That's just stupid and indefensible. We should celebrate age and sexuality. Condemning them just shows how ignorant and pathetic the purview of this country has become.I do agree that the timing of the release was very poorly chosen. This just isn't the market for erotic thrillers or for a more serious frank view of sex, period. If this movie had been released in a less restrictive time, it would have done better. It certainly wouldn't have been as vilified as it has been. Further more; the MPAA wouldn't have felt the need to cut the thing to all hell. It is an excellent sequel. It deserves far better treatment than it is receiving. It's really a shame actually, and it's also very telling of major issues within our overly judgmental and uneducated culture.",Basic Instinct 2

I thought Sharon Stone gave a great performance and looked stunning and the cast of well known British actors also gave their usual high standard of performance. The camera work was very atmospheric and , as I am a Londoner myself, I felt it captured the glamorous and the seedy side of the West End. I thought the dialogue in the original was clichéd whereas this felt a lot more believable.The only scene I thought the film could have done without is the orgy in a Soho brothel.",Basic Instinct 2

You only need to watch this movie to see what I'm talking about or not. I mean you could just take my word for it and save yourself the cinema ticket and more importantly the two hours that you're gonna sit there fighting to stop yourself from doing all sort of unimaginable things to all those responsible for making you suffer the agony that is this movie.They tried too hard with this movie, trying to make something out of nothing. You want to see a plot with twists and turns, watch seven, watch the usual suspects! They were huge hits and no one took their clothes off! The dialogue is full of clichés and reminds you of all those B movies only except you wouldn't pay to watch a B movie. The sex in this movie was needless, pointless. In BS1 it was part of the story...It was original and thrilling and there was chemistry! This time around it was Granny Stone forcing herself onto the Pillsbury Dough boy. Forced, awful and just peppered in wherever they could fit it. I guess they were trying to follow the old Hollywood concept...you gotta strip to make a hit but what they forgot was that this does not apply to Grannies! I mean what is that woman thinking! She nearing here 50's! Yes the big 50! Keep your clothes on woman, for god sakes, regardless of how much cosmetic surgery you've had! So it all that bad you ask....well its worse! However there are some good things, the locations are stunning, sharp and slick. Along the way there are some thrills to be had but above all, after watching this movie you sort of get the feeling that Ms Stone has probably stripped on screen for the final time and well there is comfort in that. I mean if this movie were a box office hit, you could be sure to see Ms Stone strip again when in 14 years time! (ughhh ... shudder)",Basic Instinct 2

The attempt at film-noir is a high investment polished flop, the producers and director would have done better to film in black and white and concentrate less on adrenaline and testosterone/estrogen pumping...Sharon Stone without a doubt could play an excellent Bad Bitch , but the effort is wasted....they chose to show too much T&A under the false impression this would convey a sense of realism...The attempt failed. What a waste of talent. Maybe if every one goes to see the film Ms. Stone can make a few dollars and finish her days living frugally in a small Albanian or Turkish village ( if she gets paid % ) and the American or British Psychiatric association can reap the benefits of everyone trying their hand at manipulating a Psychologist....Go see it,but don't eat till afterward.",Basic Instinct 2
237,annaharbacz,Painfully Bad,1,19 March 2006,"Well, I saw this movie yesterday and it's - unfortunately - worse than you could think. First of all the plot is idiotic, it has no sense at all. The screenplay is full of intentionally funny dialogues. The audience was laughing many times. And the suspense is very low. Actors play so-so, with an exception of Sharon Stone, who has some good moments but also some awfully bad acting moments. The saddest parts are when she tries to be aggressively sexy and says things like ""I want to *beep* you "" and it looks like, let's say it gently, a very very mature woman acting rude and not sexy at all. That erotic tension from BI1 is totally gone. From the technical point of Basic Instinct 2 is a mediocre movie - better than typical straight to DVD, but on a far lower lever than the original movie. For instance the scene of crazy joyride is done poorly. The director of Basic Instinct 2 is no Paul Verhoeven and it shows. The new composer is no Jerry Goldsmith and its shows. The script is done by people who are no match for Joe Eszterhas. There's no substitute for Michael Douglas in it. The film looks cheap and badly edited at times. I'm sorry but my first thought after I left the theater was: ""Why heaven't they made this movie earlier and with original talents behind the success of the first movie?"" All to all the original movie is like Citizen Kane compared to this. The first Basic Instinct is a classic and was a kind of break-thru in the popular cinema. It was provoking, sexy and controversial. It had the best Sharon Stone's performance in her career. It had this specific Paul Verhoeven's style. Unfortunately Basic Instinct 2 is a unintentionally funny movie, badly directed and a sure Razzie Award Winner in many categories. It's a pity that they made this film.",Basic Instinct 2
238,borgs1,Sharon Stone was bad and just got worse,1,3 June 2007,Sharon stone is the epitome of talentless women who think they are 'serious' actresses because they get famous. Forgetting they got famous for flashing flesh. The high point (low point?) of her career is the crotch shot in the first basic instinct. Making this movie shows how completely desperate she is to hold on to her fame despite the fact that her dubious good looks have aged past what Hollywood will accept for the type of roles she fits. Please! Revoke her SAG card! She also represents the worst of the checkbook liberals who spout dangerous unresearched opinions that are reported on biased media outlets. The best we can hope for is for her never be heard from again.,Basic Instinct 2
239,gw_lady,Pretty good standalone story in it's own right,8,1 February 2007,"Dudes, If you put aside all the prejudice from the BI1, you'll see this as a pretty good standalone movie. It has menace, it has creepiness, and in fact, this one has a lot of depth and dialogue. No one really has any one-liners. There are many different camera angles (shots of the skyline, birds-eye view, closeups), there's lots of style (see costumes). The cinematography definitely reflects 2006. Looking back, the BI1 had cheesy dialogue, plain colours, lack of depth. The BI1 just seems rather dated.If you try to tie the BI1 storyline to BI2, you'll see that it connects pretty well. Folks, it's been 14 years since BI1, changes to characters/situations are expected. It's natural for Catherine to be more confident and skilled at what she does. Whereas BI1 portrayed her as having a softer, naive side, this one gives her more edge due to the additional 14 years of life experience in between. It is unrealistic to have her be exactly the way she was before. However, if the BI2 story is set to be just shortly after BI1, then yes the character should be similar. Also, choosing a London backdrop seems to indicate that she was evading something from the US.I personally think Sharon performed better in BI2 than BI1. She has more screen time, says more witty things, has more expressions, and is more consistent with her character from shot to shot I notice that in BI1, sometimes she acted differently between shots. Most people would take it as the intention to confuse the audience, but I think it was just inexperienced acting. Somehow the effect worked (by accident?), which became an end to itself.-GW",Basic Instinct 2

And now she's showing off her 50 year old cosmetically altered body?...YUCK! Anywho, never mind all of that 50 year old sexless body garbage... This movie was stupid, no other words can describe it. I usually enjoy Sharon Stone in films, but here she over-acted which caused her to underachieve. Her evil B*%$# role was overstated and silly. I tried to follow this film but it was too campy. The characters were bad as was the plot. Other than a fantastic wardrobe rocked by our aged heroin (which was the only reason I didn't turn this schlock off), this movie sucked.",Basic Instinct 2
241,DutchMan82,"A really terrible film with no saving graces - bad dialogue, bad acting, bad direction...just plain BAD!",1,16 March 2006,"I saw this film at the London Premiere, and I have to say - I didn't expect much, but I did expect something that was at least mildly entertaining.The original ""Basic Instinct"" was no great film and is still something of a ""smut classic"" but it was entertaining. I can recall countless times flipping through channels on TV on a late Friday or Saturday night having come across the movie and finding myself beginning to actually pay attention to it.However, this lame-brain, waaay-belated sequel has nothing. Is Sharon Stone still gorgeous? Well, let's put it this way -- for a 47-year-old, she's pretty hot. Is she as beautiful as she was in the original? No. She also has clearly had plastic surgery on her face, and her haircut in this movie is somewhat unappealing. She doesn't look as soft or genuine or innocent as she did in the original -- which is sort of the whole point of being an evil seductress, and whatnot.The rest of the performances range from bad to terrible -- and Michael Caton-Jones (a typically safe director -- one who doesn't always do great work but manages to make worthwhile movies) has officially delivered his first true turkey; a movie so bad people were laughing at certain moments that were intended to be serious.I hear the film went through multiple editing sessions, and it's very clear from the start. Nothing makes much sense. The whole plot is a cosmic mess and the ending -- oh my! Talk about stupid AND unbelievable. (Still predictable, though.) I saw ""Gigli,"" I saw ""Son of the Mask"" -- and although I'm not looking to ""smear"" this film, I can say with my own authority (which you don't have to agree with at all, mind you) that I prefer both those films over this catastrophic failure.By the way, Stone left five minutes before the movie began and people in the theater began throwing things at the screen during a particularly outrageous and insulting scene inside an orgy-type nightclub.""Basic Instinct 2"" -- basically, it stinks, too.",Basic Instinct 2

My take on it is that the issues were just blown out of proportion. I think Basic Instinct 2 is a passable film with a good story and is just a victim of snowballed negative emotions. I'm beginning to feel like to give Basic Instinct 2 a bad bad bad review is somehow cool and there's this need for reviewers to join the bandwagon. It has become the easy target when there are worse films out there. Before I saw the film, i rarely found an objective review (NOTE: I said objective, not positive, because even though I am aiming for objectivity, I cannot say that Basic Instinct 2 is a perfect film, as mentioned earlier, it is passable).(SPOILER ALERT) I liked the story's twists and how Catherine Tramell's evil schemes and cunning caused the disintegration of Michael Glass. It seems that after all these years, Ms. Tramell has just gotten better deceit-wise.I agree that the film lacked eroticism and I think that the London setting did not help: It just lacks the sleaze and the lusty atmosphere of California in the first film.If this film has been shown earlier, say 3-5 years after the first installment, then things would have been way different.",Basic Instinct 2

Maybe not to see a half a dozen times at the movie theater but still a good movie to watch.Sharon Stone still looks pretty good for being as old as she is. She played a role that is very sexy and i think she still pulled it off. Maybe not with flying colors but she still had the sex appeal.I agree, the movie shouldn't be in the theaters for too long.

First of all, I had really enjoyed the first one which came out when I was still in college. Secondly, I like the fact that Sharon Stone wanted to show that women over 40 can still be sexy and desirable. Unfortunately, the movie didn't work for me. It misses its natural audience: mature and/or older people who still have a very active social and sexual life. Had the movie been conceived to appeal to them, it might have been interesting. Instead, BI 2 seems to go after a younger crowd. (nothing wrong with that.) However, why would a 20 year old want to see 48 year old Sharon Stone naked when he can look at Jessica Simpson's legs in the ""Dukes of Hazzard""? Beats me. I left the theater a little sad because Sharon Stone is a great actress and I admire her courage for trying to show that it's a shame that women over 35 suddenly become invisible nowadays. It is a pity that such an intriguing concept, because of poor execution,will probably go to waste.",Basic Instinct 2
245,crazy_nanabush,It Has Its Moments But Doesn't Measure Up To The Original,5,12 April 2006,"Yes, it's true. This film is a bit of a turkey but it does have its moments. For instance, one of my favourite scenes takes place during Catherine's last treatment with Dr. Glass. Straddling an armless black leather chair with her legs spread out on either side, she confronts Dr. Glass with a seductive sexual purr about his fantasies of wanting to sleep with her. She goes into explicit detail about how he'd like to ravage her all the while we hear the squeaking of the leather fabric on the chair that she's straddling. It was a great moment. Probably the best in the entire movie. The audience literally burst out laughing when Catherine suddenly breaks her predatory purr and gets up from the chair then walks out of the office.True, this film will probably go onto to win a bunch of Razzies but I'm sure it will do relatively well on home video with the ""rated"" and ""unrated"" versions. I got a sense that a lot of the sexuality was cut out of the movie. A lot of the steamy scenes felt chopped to bits by bad editing.Do I recommend you go see this film in the theatre? If you simply want to see a little bit of eye candy, fluff and experience Ms. Stone at trying to squeeze what's left out of the role that helped catapult her to stardom, then by all means go for it.

The effective plot is very much alike in the two movies. The plot is driven by mind games (and not always very realistic ones) and attempts to challenge the viewers opinion on who the killer is.It may also appeal to people with professional interest in psychotherapy, not because of its accuracy, rather the opposite, but it is always entertaining to watch ones profession depicted on screen, regardless of the accuracy of realism (if nothing else it is good for a laugh).If you don't fall into one of the above mentioned categories, you probably shouldn't watch this in the theaters (or at all), but if you do, you would probably enjoy it at least as a rental :-).",Basic Instinct 2

I will admit this film is not as good as the original, but it's almost as good. The quality of filming in some scenes is superior and the film takes a confusing path once again. Sharon Stone at times looks like she walked off the set of Basic Instinct straight on to this one, OK maybe off the set of Sliver, but she looks great and Catherine is as seductive as ever. I did walk into the film thinking she'd seem more like a desperate, horny old woman, but she proved me wrong and i have to eat those words.

I don't think someone can seriously believe it's a squeal. They just use the name to attract people to watch. The movie is excellent but it has nothing to do with Basic Instinct.Someone said its better late than neverso I glade they did this movie .i think if they had using another actress(younger) and find another name for itthis movie would become the hit of the decade.I forget about basic instinct label and I enjoy the movie very match. If you going to sit on the chair and be exited to watch the sequel of Basic Instinct you going to be disappointed.And I so Miss Michel Douglas but David Morrissey is an excellent actor. I don't know where he was hidden till now. I'm sure he is going to be a big star.As the bottom line I think the script of this movie was more colorful than the original but less emotional, more killing , more movies , more food for thoughts.

The sequel takes place in London, where Catherine has now relocated. Both bustling cities known for excitement, haute couture ~ and a perfect place for someone like Catherine Trammel to take residency. David Morrisey, (""Derailed""), plays the smooth role of psychiatrist Dr. Michael Glass. The character David Thewlis plays as Roy Washburn with Scotland Yard, is a refreshing departure from his role as Lupin in the Harry Potter series.

252,don-594,"Great Movie, depending on your mindset",10,1 April 2006,"Catherine Tramell is back, and she is busy mind-f***ing yet another guy (besides the physical act itself). This time she's moved to the UK and London. The movie is very slick and if you enjoyed the first one you will like the second one. It's very seductive suspenseful and full of twists and turns.The people that will tell you this movie is bad probably didn't enjoy the first one, or like movies about powerful women who can manipulate a situation to it's fullest. I rank Catherine Trammell as a character who is up there and way beyond Hannnibal Lecture, and others. There is something lustful and lovingly devilish about this woman who personifies control and manipulation.I think straight men will be spooked by this movie, even more than the first one because it will rub at their psyche.. I think most of the male reviewers giving this film the thumbs down won't like it mainly because it will hit too close to home. Gay men might like it because of the film's emphasis on sexual openness and risk taking. Also seeing a strong female lead character who is in control is a very seductive and fun thing to watch. There are very strong sexual situations in the movie, and I don't think it's good for young people who don't have some parental guidance.The movie is full of beauty from the London sets, to Sharon Stone's wardrobe. Watching her in the movie it's very difficult to remember that I saw the first one in 1992 and we are watching the sequel in 2006. Sharon Stone is absolutely beautiful and her grace and elegance hasn't been lost in the years between. In fact she looks very much the same. Age hasn't crept in at all even though we know from the news that this woman has been through a lot in the meantime. Either way it's good to see her back. I look forward to more of her films in the future. If they plan to sequel this one, they really need to find a male antithesis of her character as no one stacks up to her so far. Another look into her life needs to show us some equalization.If you want an edge of your seat weekend movie experience I recommend Basic Instinct 2.. If you are going because you expect a different movie than the first one or something out of character for Catherine don't go. If you like the character's perverseness, open sexuality, and a story about a woman in control you will like this movie. I don't agree with the previous person's review. The movie is slick, well-made and a fun romp into a woman's life who obviously has some control issues. If you like the character go see the movie. If you go expecting a mystery or a completely new storyline don't bother. It's like seeing Hannibal after seeing seeing silence of the lambs. Completely different focus.

253,david-3004,"Lotsa sizzle, but no steak",3,2 April 2006,"Let me start by saying that Sharon Stone is an exceptional actress. However she tries, her acting alone cannot rescue the disaster created by the director and the script writer.This is just a bad movie. There's nothing to hang onto in this film. The male actors are spineless unknowns that cannot counterbalance Sharon's performance -- she dominates the film, overwhelming it actually, and been given lines that just seem ridiculous.It's so sad the Basic Instinct 2 is such a disaster. There was SO much potential -- picture this...Catherine Tremell could have married the cop in basic instinct (who could be the now-promoted head of the San Francisco police force) who now writes about world leaders and gets swept into an international drama involving the UN and an underground crime ring with a sleeper cell in San Francisco. OR something else. But, this story is so misplaced that the whole movie doesn't make sense. Catherine Tremell, 14 years later, should be more socially integrated and respected, into politics, and able to see things that others can't.My vote: fire the director and the writer. Tell movie lovers that the whole film was a huge mistake, head back to the drawing board, and come back with something that works. I'd be ready and willing to give it a second chance as this story has incredible potential - the likes of being a series classic, like the 007 series.

I would rival the acting in the film to an Angel Soft commercial (if you've never seen one - it's definitely not a compliment). Sharon Stone has taken overacting to a whole new level, maybe rivaling Jim Carey without a comedy. The plot is skin deep, and if it makes sense, predictable until a confusing ending that seems to lack any forethought as to a direction for the movie.

In fact, it is a highly entertaining and even intelligent film noir. Sharon Stone was great  sexy and funny (and no, not unintentionally funny; she seemed to be having fun with the character) . I would urge everyone who hasn't seen it yet to do so, and judge for yourself. It's not only not awful, it's actually pretty good.

Congrats to a haggard old Stone for playing a mentally unstable self important middle-aged woman, which she does very well on a daily basis as she is approaches 60. I'd say her performance as a killer is really more believable than most of the nonsense she generally spews from her celebrity pulpit on sex and politics. Anyway the film is a total disappointment, the stiff who take's on the Michael Douglas role is obviously cashing a paycheck more so than acting - and I feel especially bad for the two veteran actors who have stained their careers with this piece of tripe.

You may think that it would compare to the original Basic Instinct, but that would be an insult. Basic Instinct was a great erotic thriller that kept me interested to the very end. Basic Instinct 2 was downright boring and predictable from the start. I kept waiting for the eroticism and mystery to begin, but the only mystery was why I stayed in the theater. I guess you could say that Sharon Stone is sexually captivating...even at this age. However, if you are planning on watching this movie to see Sharon in all her splendor, you'd be better off watching the original...or surfing the web for a few minutes. The only sex scene involving S.S. was painful and amusing. You will not be missing anything if you pass on BI2, so save your money or see ANYTHING else.

258,vikierdinc,"close to superb cinematography, Stone is a perfection as she always used to be...",10,8 April 2006,"First of all I want to highlight that I have watched this movie the second time yesterday evening to come to a real conclusion if I really liked it or not. Luckily I made myself clear that BI2 did very well at all in most of the criteria.When I first saw it I thought that BI 1 was way better than this because I had too many unsolved questions in my head . However when I saw it the second time , everything has changed and now BI2 is surely better than first for me.I do not understand why a lot of people have great objections to this movie and too many negative comments. In fact the main reason of this is always comparing it to the first one which I already did. This is not fair to compare a sequel to a prequel if the first one is already a smash hit and effected a lot of people. I remember a few movies that the sequels surpassed the popularity and the box office success of the prequels which comes to mind first is T2 , it was a sequel and it was a real success. But T1 was also a classic , can we say that due to T2 was great so T1 sucked , no not at all!!. I liked Basic Instinct 2 because: 1 ) It started a bit slow , with so many dialogs . But about after 40 minutes it started to get faster, suspense started release it self and the movie started to get some meaning and finalizing with a great twist and left everyone highly effected by Ms. Stone again.2)There is a real real fact that Sharon Stone is a great actress and she did her best in this movie no less than the first one. (She can not do any less acting even if she wants because she is naturally good!!! )About the sexiness and beauty: Well it is strange that something is missing from her sexiness and beauty from the first movie (by the way we're talking about 14 years!!! , its OK.)But somehow she is more beautiful and dazzling. Her looks and tricky behaviors are fantastic, thanks to her she deserved 14 million to the each cent!!! 3) It is true that the absence of Michael Douglas can not be filled because he is a great actor and he caught a very good combination with Sharon Stone in 1992. However now he even himself can not fill his space because he is 60!!! and he looks 60 maybe more than 60 but Sharon doesn't so whoever has a good or close to good acting talent replacing his role would be OK for this movie and so is David Morissey.He is not great , even sometimes boring but what does it matter ? We have no Michael Douglas here and Morissey is not much a problem. He could also catch a good connection with Stone and he did in some ways especially in the end.4) Charlotte Rampling was a great supporter and gave seriousness to the movie.5) The score was great , even greater than the first one. I'm sorry but I really can not understand why some people still have even objections to the score.Oh come on people you are really lying to your selves. The score was so fascinating and effective especially when Morissey was following Stone on the streets,that was really great. And also in some scenes there was a combination of the first movie's score and still some people say the score was not as good as it was in the first movie . . How can this be true while the music is same with the first movie just different tones and instrumentals are used ??? Thats really unbelievable !!!6)The plot was good , twists were good, the clothes were good, the locations were good, what can I say more? In short it s a very pity that this movie is sucking in box office at the moment and it is really not deserving it. Its just because of the ridiculous negative critics. On the contrary this movie is one of the best of its kind. I want to say that we have very popular movie critics in Turkey and the most popular of them gave 3 out of 4 stars to BI 2 and rated it on top of Brokeback Mountain and Capote. 2.8 points in IMDb is really not fair. I suggest everyone to watch it again!!!!",Basic Instinct 2
259,peter-burton-1,Well I liked it !,7,9 April 2006,"I cannot accept the negative comments of other reviewers. They are too critical, perhaps because they are stuck in the past. I would like to see a comment from someone who had never seen Basic Instinct 1, perhaps someone very young ? I left the cinema feeling glad that I had not been swayed by the IMDb reviewers. 14 hours later I am still trying to find flaws in the plot but I cannot think of anything serious. My advice to everyone is see it for yourself and make up your own mind.It follows a similar pattern to Basic Instinct 1 but the plot is less confused. It still left me wondering at the end but in a more satisfactory way. Sharon Stone is as sexy and evil as before and wears her 48 years extremely well; this remains her defining role. David Morrisey was satisfactory even though he is no Michael Douglas. Of the supporting cast I particularly liked David Thewlis as the police detective.",Basic Instinct 2
260,stephk911,Critics are Wrong,8,9 April 2006,"VERY entertaining, skillfully made, Sharon is right back into her character, she is excellent and the cast and location are hot!! I don't understand the critics who want to skewer her, there is such jealousy of her talent and looks, which is so unnecessary. The movie is fun, entertaining, true 'popcorn movie' and as good a sequel as any. while missing Michael Douglas, the other actors were very accomplished, and hold their own with her. It kept my attention to the very end, and I for one look forward to the DVD release with extras. Sharon looked great, her clothes were gorgeous, and the sets were stylish and very much a part of the movie. It was a great concept to put her in London, different and actually made some of the S & M more believable. All in all, a very entertaining diversion and a sexy time at the movies.",Basic Instinct 2
261,shoelessone,Surprisingly good,9,14 July 2006,"Although I started watching Basic Instinct 2 with a good deal of reservation after reading numerous negatives that cast the film in a less than positive light, I found in time that the movie was surprisingly good. I must admit first of all that I may very well have enjoyed this movie because of the sexually charged characters in the film, however I think this says a lot about the film itself. Sharon Stone did a fantastic job and in my opinion was just as sexy in this flick as she was in the original, despite the fact that the old film was done 12 years ago.I felt the screenplay was well done and most of the dialog was well done and felt right with the movie, especially when you take into account the previous movie. I will say that I was not thrilled with all of the plot (and plot twists) but just like the original movie I appreciated (and hated!) being left at the credits thinking to myself ""wow, so what DID happen?""",Basic Instinct 2
262,charls_smith_xx,"i think that it was a great film, or may be i just liked the actress??",8,12 April 2006,"I have a very different opinion to what i have seen so far, i believe this movie was brilliant, yes Sharon stone was cringey at times, but i think she was brilliant, but she could have been seen as annoying at times.Throughout the film there was an obvious thought which meant Sharon was the killer, but the twist was good because it was obviously not going to be the person who you thought it was from the beginning or there would be no point watching the end. Yes, Sharon stone is still sexy, and i believe that she it a great actress.. However i would avoid going to see this film if you want an easy watching film, as you do need to put the pieces of the jigsaw together. So far from basic instinct 2 i have only seen bad reviews and i do not think this is fair. It it not a particular strange taste that will like this as i like all sorts of films (man on fire, honey) all kinds such as chick flicks, comedy's, and thrillers. Some people will not have liked the goriness, and raunchiness of the film, but it wasn't that bad really!! overall, this film was a sexy film, i would see this again, and it is a good film to see with a partner or friends!",Basic Instinct 2
263,waysgain,I have rated the movie 9 - read why,9,14 April 2006,I had seen reviews of various portals for the movie and expected that it would be crap as the average rating was 2.5 on 10. I was expecting to go to sleep in the hall but the movie was not all that bad and so I enjoyed it as my expectations were low. I am hence rating it 9 out of 10. Those who go to the hall with low expectations will enjoy the thriller for sure. At least I did and so did all my friends who expected crap after I told them what I had read. Sharon Stone is definitely looking old but hides her age well. She is no longer the same she was in 1992. I was impressed with the movie and would recommend people to surely see it.,Basic Instinct 2

I think they have been intentionally engineered that way.The industry had been panning this movie, before it was even released and reviewed. They want it to fail.You can tell, the reviews are not critical, they are down right hostile and hateful. Even some of the reader critics here, I'm wondering if they are really your average Joe, or someone making up email addresses just to write bad reviews.The movie was extremely entertaining. Yes, it's true, sometimes you will laugh. Not because it's bad, but because some of Sharon's line are so cut throat and on the mark. It's like when your friend is being evil.Sharon's acting was great. She really caught the character.People will look back on this movie and say how good it is.",Basic Instinct 2
265,jim-huggard,Can't understand the bad reviews,10,17 April 2006,"I saw Basic Instinct 2 in German last Friday because a friend wanted to see it. Normally I wouldn't be bothered with this kind of movie and can't remember ever seeing the whole of Basic Instinct 1. Anyway I found the new one very entertaining and went to see it again in English yesterday, Sunday, partly too because the plot needed a bit of checking out. I enjoyed it even more the second time around. It's a film with very strong visual images that really stay with you. The acting is first rate, Sharon Stone is in my opinion just divine to look at, and the development of the plot is slow enough for the characters to take on real flesh but without losing tension. The plot in itself is incredibly unlikely but who cares? The scene where Dr. Glass screws the waitress was missing in the English version, and possibly a few other short scenes too.",Basic Instinct 2

The first one had the basic instincts surrounding the story, but this one has the basic instincts surrounding a plot! An excellent plot, I must say. Besides, the temptation, the danger, the emotion, they are all there, with the wonderful action of Sharon Stone and David Morrisey. And those minor details, from the shape of a lighter to the subtlety of a phrase. It's a movie to excite you and keep you on the seat seeking and waiting for the truth, which is revealed on the last scene. Or isn't it?",Basic Instinct 2

I saw this movie and thought it was better than the first. Maybe it wasn't big budget but the story was fine for what it was and Stone's character was much more developed. Why must Americans pick our flicks apart? Can't we just enjoy the movie for what it is? sex, suspense, sex. Not everything has to be Forrest Gump. (The lamest, most over-hyped movie I've ever watched) Like some others have noticed, I think most of the reviewers that gave this film a negative review were just uneasy with the sex symbol/seductress being 40+++ and not 19. For those of us without deep seeded Mommy issues and that are a little more sophisticated and comfortable with our sexuality, that isn't a problem. I'm a 30+++ straight female and Sharon Stone's performance had me looking for a cold shower. This film isn't meant to provoke thought but stimulate one in other areas. Go in expecting that and you'll walk out satisfied.",Basic Instinct 2

I wish I could send the 20 quid bill to the EP.Its such as shame since the first was a lovely homage to noir and Sharon Stone essentially revived the Femme Fatal with such modern force. I guess when a film is six years in the making and faced so many setbacks in really should have ben binned.It misses on direction, editing, acting, storyline and, and, and.....

270,aworlando,A great accomplishment - every bit if not better than the first,9,14 July 2006,"If you like sexy mystery thrillers, this is one film that is a must see. And, if you like Sharon Stone as I do, you will find that this film may in some ways - be better than the first. Sharon Stone, plays Catherine Trammell as in the original Basic Instinct. She is extremely revetting, and stronger than ever... very direct, captivating, and brilliant. She delivers an even more seductive performance than the younger Catherine Trammel of the original Basic Instinct which co-starred Michael Douglas. The story has the right blend of complexity and atmosphere. To help gain perspective and to try to understand the wickedly clever character Catherine Trammel, this film probably should be viewed several times - watch the subtle facial expressions, and hear her confident dialogue. It is obvious that Sharon Stone has the intelligence for the cunning role of Trammel. The part is just so well played. She certainly has my vote for the all-time brilliant, cunning, beautiful and sexy femme fatal. With great care given to the set design, casting, and background music, this is a film not to be missed.",Basic Instinct 2
271,danawuerfel,Worst Movie I've Seen in Years,1,5 September 2006,"This film is awful. The screenplay is bad, the is script mediocre, and even the sex scenes are worthless. The thrill and intrigue of the original film are completely lacking. This movie was shot in a dark, shadowy and monochromatic style (a la ""War of the Worlds""), which is so disappointing after the beauty of the original film. Greg Morrisey's brooding character displays one facial expression throughout the film. The twists and turns of the original plot are woefully lacking here; the few that do exist are simply anticlimactic. The only highlight is Sharon Stone's performance as Catherine Tramell, faithfully continued in this sequel, but it isn't enough to make up for the other shortcomings. The only circumstance under which a ""Basic Instinct 3"" should be made would be if Michael Douglas agrees to join the cast.",Basic Instinct 2

I hate the Disney feel that most films have today, and I love that this film has gone beyond that, to the dark, sexual, trashy, and dirty elements and it serves us with a fun film. I like it a lot, there's a lot of fowl language, and some pretty risqué scenes, and all the psycho sexual mind boggling is awesome! Who wants to be trapped in a Christian family movie when you get Sharon Stone reprising her role as the Catherine Tramell character? Screw the best film movies, and the Oscars for that matter!

When an actress or an actor become old, people usually start to put them aside and forget what they brought to us, things like a name, an new attitude, a message among many other things. I think we should appreciate all efforts of those professionals because whatever they do, they do for us. There's no bad or good movies, only critics (they need to work too).

The movie is so pathetic and it should have been in the category of a comedy. Sharon stone is old and she looks like an ugly witch. The story line is so weak and none of the characters were impressive with their performances. There was no suspense, the sexual scenes are horrible and finally it was a real pain to watch the movie. At least there should have been an end to the story in the sequel after watching all that crap. Instead watch either a pure thriller or a porno. I would not suggest this movie to anyone.....especially to people who might fall into the trap of watching Sharon... No she is not hot at all.....It so funny that she at grandmother's age had done this film. Actually I thought of giving a zero to this film, but unfortunately there is no zero here.",Basic Instinct 2

Sharon Stone is not only unbelievable but also a complete turnoff in this dreadful sequel to an otherwise great first movie. All the butox in the world can't help her make this movie even a little bit sexy. Sad really, because I have always found Sharon Stone entertaining.The plot is a laugh/cry which I won't even take time commenting on. What is for sure is that the only reason this movie was made was to cash in on the first Basic Instinct. I am truly amazed that some producers (and directors) have the nerve (and the money) to make movies like this anymore, considering most moviegoers these days are pretty quality orientated.Last but not least is the production. It just looks so cheap. The stage sets reminds me of B rolls from the sixties. It's all mostly paper. The location is suppose to be London but the first scene in the movie don't quit look like London to me ...I would strongly recommend to leave this movie on the shelf where it belong and rather try to remember Cathrine Tramell like she was 16 years ago in the first ace movie. This is pure crap!",Basic Instinct 2

The plot was OK, could be better actors in the main roles. The directing and the filming were good, I think that Michael Caton-Jones did a nice job with this film, and i will not forget that the score was as good as in the first movie.Maybe some of the story events may seem without sens or some actions are simply ""stupid"" that a normal person would not do them, and i think that is the reason of the film misunderstanding, but the storyline is interesting and the idea of serial-killer sex-addictive psycho is the point of the entire movie, and i'm sure that the director transmitted it so well for those who understand it.For me this movie is so underrated and i saw much worst movies than this one and I will say if there will be the third movie soon, i will go out and see it! and my advice for you all, don't judged a movie by their ratings or critical point of view, just go and watch them!",Basic Instinct 2
280,Trinity7mac,Should Have Left It Alone,4,16 November 2008,"I understand why a sequel to this movie was made. The original had so much to offer. It's a fantastic mystery that somehow convinced you to feel sorry for the beautiful rich woman who always got what she wanted. She even got away with murder. The sequel however lacked the ability to carry over the suspense, the intrigue or a script that didn't seem to completely be a rip off of the original only with more names and more twists than you can imagine making it hard to follow at times. Sharon Stone looked fantastic and the cast was great. The acting was good for what this script offered. Personally I wish they would have just left it alone.

This time she's just a rich beautiful crazy chick, who writes bad novels and doesn't really care about anything... You don't feel her strong presence in the whole story. Maybe this is because of the weak script, but the actors made the best out of it...

And this doesn't make this movie seem like realistic at all to me, like this guy Dr. Michael Glass hears how dirty she is and even see her having sex with some punk and after all he still fancy her? Sex seems to be main thing in this movie and then some murders just that it wouldn't get so boring. If you want to see sex, I recommend renting a porn film or something instead of this crap.

I thought this film was actually alright, certainly not as bad as most people would suggest. I thought the acting was pretty solid from the main characters however pretty poor from the minors. The story was alright but hardly anything original and the ending just didn't work for me. I felt this film was reasonably well directed but could have easily been done with a much smaller budget..i still have no idea how they managed to spend 70 million on this.. Unlike other reviews, i didn't think of this film as cheap and tacky and have to admit i enjoyed most of it.

It has layers within layers, nuanced acting by Stone,and a plot that will keep you guessing even after it's over. People need to get over the fact that Sharon Stone is 48,and that Michael Douglas isn't in this one. I predict that this film will be a huge hit on DVD once people see it for themselves and stop paying attention to the drivel professional reviewers put out.

285,phughes699,Basic Instinct 2,7,23 April 2007,I have just watched Basic Instinct 2 and found it to be quite a good movie. The acting by Sharon Stone was good and the psychologist Michael Glass played a great part. I think I watched the uncut version because there was a fair amount of nudity in the movie. Quite interesting to see Sharon Stone topless but not really necessary. She is a lovely lady with her clothes on. The story was interesting.It was quite plausible and the type of thing that can happen when a man is intrigued with a beautiful woman.It took place in London England with Scotland Yard doing the investigating.I cannot understand why people have criticized this movie.It was very enjoyable to watch and there were plenty of twists in the story at the end. I'm still not sure who did the murders. Is there going to be a Basic Instinct 3? Maybe there will be. I for one will watch it if it happens.,Basic Instinct 2

Moments of bad acting from her yes, but for the most part my heart raced while watching her. It was not a brilliant movie by any means but it had suspense, sex, and it did not seem slow. I left the the theatre with the movie still playing in my mind and is still with me an hour after it was over. Sharon Stone how ever fake she may be is just a sight to see. She is amazing for her age, and hey it is not the beauty that always makes her sexy, it is her confidence level. She is sex and she shows it. The opening scene is intense and the intensity stays with throughout. I give it a 8/10 and a brava to Ms. Stone",Basic Instinct 2

In the first Basic Instinct she was just hot and mysterious, the second one shows her sick side, her dark side, the way she watches people, you see a women who has grown, a women who is still doing what she has done all her life, but it is getting harder for her, harder to get satisfied from what she does. I loved the scene where she goes to the red light district and tries to pick up some guy, and when he refuses she pulls out some money and pays him to Bang her. the storyline didn't have to be so similar to the first movie, they could just shown her living a normal life until she meets someone who gets interested in her and tries to find out everything about her. Catherine Trammel went from being this dangerous vixen in Basic Instinct 1 to a sick dangerous women in the second part.",Basic Instinct 2
288,lt-ripley,Watch without prejudice! It's not that bad at all!,8,9 April 2006,"So, every year there is at least one movie, that hasn't got any chance of being a box office success, because from the moment of production, even before one simple shot is filmed, everybody's picking on this movie... There is a long list of these kind of movies, and in the end, some are really bad (Battlefield Earth (2000)), some may have their flaws but are quite enjoyable (Catwoman (2004), Elektra (2005)) and then there are a few, which actually are really great for what they are, but no one admits! I mean, my gosh, just because the wide crowd does have to have a victim each year they can pick on, not everybody has to join them. So yeaaah, maybe those movies aren't perfect, but c'mon, how many movies are? Not every movie is supposed to be a new The Lord of the Rings! Not everybody will enjoy these movies, but I bet there are more than who admit they do. Hudson Hawk (1991), who is just hysterical funny, Color of Night (1994), which may not be Oscar-worthy, but is definitely a not dumb at all thriller with some nice twists, Swept Away (2002), which I thought is a great mix of sick humor and a beautiful romance, Gigli (2003), which was great entertainment with some really memorable lines and not badly acted at all from the former ""Bennifer""-Couple, and this year it's ""Basic Instinct 2""! Well, when I heard the rumors of a sequel to one of my favorite movies I was very sceptically, and although I really love Sharon Stone I stayed sceptically until I've finally seen this movie. And really, I was very positively surprised! I can't understand why it gets such a bad press and such a bad voting here. It never simply copies the original, it has a quite clever story, has tension, action, humor and the absolutely stunning Sharon Stone reprising the role of her life! With 47 years when shooting the movie she looks hotter than many stars in their 20s, but it's more than her being beautiful, it's brilliantly acted, with all her looks, her famous smile, the way she speaks and moves... from the very first frame she's in you can't take your eyes off of her. It's simply a pleasure to watch her as Catherine Tramell, and all of the other actors deliver solid performances, too! So I really can't see what's wrong with this movie... it has a dark, thrilling, sexy and gritty look, strong performances, and you never felt bored! Maybe the story isn't Oscar-caliber, but it never even tries to be! It's an entertainment-movie, and by this standard it absolutely delivers in my opinion! So give it a try!",Basic Instinct 2
289,fleuby,not completely awful,7,18 August 2006,"I rented the unrated version of this from the video store the other day and wanted to write a comment before I forgot all the details. I read other people's comments and saw how low the movie's rating was when it first opened, but I have to say that at least I did not find the movie to be as bad as what many people are saying.Sharon Stone is still a movie star and does what she can with what is often mediocre writing. She still knows how to sizzle and keeps your attention throughout. The direction is not bad (the beginning sequence especially is very well shot) and the plot is interesting enough so that you are left with several possibilities about the identity of the bad guy. There are a few strong supporting performances, especially Charlotte Rampling, who I wish had gotten more screen time.So I go with my academic background and give this movie 7 stars, basically a C-. Is it a great movie? Of course not. But is it one of the worst movies ever made (as some have said)? That is even more ridiculous. But I do have 3 main problems with the film: 1. David Morissey is miscast as Stone's adversary. He may be a very competent actor, but he is no match for Stone and there doesn't seem to be much in the way of chemistry between them. Very different from Michael Douglas' case.2. Screenwriters are in love with the big mind-blowing twist at the end trick these days, but in this case you need to apply such revisionist history to the rest of the film that basically 50 minutes or so of dialogue isn't really necessary anymore. That's a shame because the film would have been fine without it.3. Whoever decided to give Sharon Stone those extensions ought to never work in Hollywood again. She occasionally looks like she has a mullet with them.",Basic Instinct 2

I expected an absolute disaster, and got something which is easily one of the most exciting films I have seen in a long time.It is alarming to read such negative reviews from respected film critics who quite frankly, do nothing but romanticise the original - as we all know, time makes the heart grow fonder. It really does make you wonder if many reviewers have actually seen the latest movie. Obviously everything comes down to personal taste so one would expect some 'mid-range' scores, but within reason! There is very little to dislike about this movie.Because of this, the movie (through no fault of anyone involved with it) will bomb at the box office. In the rental/retail market however, I have a feeling that it will be a different story altogether.Do yourselves a favour, watch the movie and make up your own mind.",Basic Instinct 2
293,brent77772,Basic Instinct 2 has flashes of brilliance,6,13 April 2006,"The movie starts out with a bang with a great scene with Sharon Stone and a soccer star in a car. I won't give away the details, but it is pretty racy, no pun intended...and also a waste of a perfectly good Viper.Actually, the Viper is a great metaphor for Stone's character Catherine Tramel. The venomous vixen like a sexually supercharged sports car. One that can go from zero to 120 in ten seconds. Or maybe faster in her case.She does play the evil temptress very well. And she still has the ""it"" quality that people talk about. Stone is still very much the star that drives this movie.The only problem is, the lead male character, Dr. Glass, played by David Morrissey, does not measure up (again, no pun intended). We miss the red-blooded male machismo of Michael Douglas in the first movie and instead have to settle for a cerebral, brooding analyst with a constant stone-faced expression.The movie was very engaging when dealing with Stone's ""risk addiction"" and all the scenes that mix Tramel's two favorite subjects, sex and death.However, the best thing about this movie is Stone. She carries it. And the plot isn't bad either. Very manipulative, yes, but much like the Tramel character we are left mesmerized by her beauty and charm, yet not knowing quite what to believe.",Basic Instinct 2
294,dekke,Not that bad - believe it.,8,15 May 2006,"The movie is not that bad. Do not be fooled by the over-hyped ""fact"" of the critics that it's a piece of ****. It's not a great movie - true, but i'm SURE that it would gotten five times better reviews if it wasn't a sequel. As a stand-alone movie, it's quite good. And as a Basic Instinct sequel, it's OK. It's clichéd and on some occasions ends up being a parody of itself, but it's fun, sexy, and great entertainment. Sharon Stone does a great job (and looks hot). The male lead and the directing are a bit weak, but it's not an epic movie, so don't expect it to be perfect. It's light entertainment. What else would you expect from a Basic Instinct - movie. Geez, people.",Basic Instinct 2
295,sharonjennings-1,Surprisingly good after the bad reviews...,10,1 April 2006,"I went to see this film last night, I was excited about it as I was a huge fan of the first one. I think what a lot of people are forgetting is that the first Basic Instinct was brought out in 1992 and at the time was shocking, nothing else around that time was quite like it, but since then movies have featured a lot more sex and violence than back then. If BI2 was brought out just a year or so after a lot more people would be raving about it. I cant see there is anything to dislike about it, It's a totally different setting in London with a whole new set of people, even if this film was set in San Francisco most of the people from BI1 died anyway so wouldn't be in it, which of course happens again in BI2. I think Morrisey came across as a believable character and an actor to look out for, Sharon played Catherine just as well as last time, her age has made no difference, yes, she looks a little older but still sexy as hell. I admit some of the lines were corny, but they were in the first movie too. The story is complicated so you have to concentrate to follow it, it's fast paced and action packed. You don't see much of the vulnerable side of Catherine in this film apart from when she admits to needing therapy, but then after killing that many people wouldn't you be hard as nails by now? They tie up loose ends from the first movie nicely regarding Nick, so you don't forget this is a sequel, but it could stand alone as a film in it's own right. I don't know what some people expected from this, there is good acting and a few shocks and a clever twist at the end, talk about role reversal! There is not as much sex in it as the first one, if there was, people would be moaning about that saying it was a cheap copy, and the only obvious person to play Catherine is Sharon, if somebody else had taken the role there would be complaints about that too. My only moan is they didn't make this sooner, 14 years is too long for a sequel... unless your Arnie/Sylvester Stallone/Harrison Ford.. Um in that case - what next Sean Connery returning as James bond? It's a good movie, go make up your own mind!",Basic Instinct 2
296,jasgalli_us,Enjoyed it a lot....it's just a movie!,8,4 April 2006,"I never trust the opinions of anyone regarding a film. That goes for critics as well. Sure, if it gets positive reviews that's OK and a plus, but most films that get critical rave I hate. I enjoyed this film for what it was, an entertaining film. It takes you out of your life for a couple hours and into a fictional character...that being Catherine Trammell. Sharon Stone is awesome in this role, just like she was in the first one. Anyone who says she is horrible in this film must have felt the same in the first one b/c she is back acting the same way she did in Basic Instinct 1. Catherine is hers and she plays her to perfection. Her one liners are great, much like in the first one. Who can forget in the first film when she tells the cops, ""If you're gonna arrest me do it...otherwise get the f**k out of here!"" Great scene, and believe me, she does it again in this one. I was captivated by her. Her outfits, the way she smoked her cigarettes, believe me, its worth the price just to see Stone's performance. I cannot wait for this film to be released on DVD, uncut, because I can only imagine how much better it is going to be. And yes, there are lots of twists, as in the first one, including the ending!",Basic Instinct 2
297,ashleysparksssss,Worth watching,6,16 November 2006,"I watched this movie before seeing Basic Instinct 1. After watching this movie, I absolutely loved it. Then I bought Basic Instinct 1, and I thought this was kind of boring. If you loved Basic Instinct 1, you don't really need to see this movie, because it's predictable. On the other hand, if you see the second one before the first you understand the first better. If youhaven't seen the first one, you will probably enjoy this a lot. I likethis movie, but it is definitely not as good as the first one. I thinkit's worth watching though, I don't understand why it got such harsh reviews. It has suspense to some degree, but the sex scenes suck. The version I got only had one with Sharon Stone, and it was barely a sex scene.",Basic Instinct 2
298,5by5_989,Saw it and Loved it! Better than the 1st!,10,13 April 2006,"I'm really angry at the critics and all the people who are hating on this film, when they haven't even seen it because the box office is terrible. In my opinion the sequel is better than the first Basic Instinct, the sequel stayed true to the 1st with music and everything besides Sharon Stone looks hotter in the new clothes she has in this one. The only thing better about the 1st is that there is more sex scenes and that was the unrated version of the 1st film so it is oblivious that they are going to release a unrated DVD of this movie when it comes out on DVD. Right after I saw Basic Instinct 2 at the theater(there were only 6 people in the theater 3 women & 3 men) I went home and watched the 1st one on DVD (unrated) and Sharon Stone looks amazing still, she was 31 in the 1st film and she is 46 in the second film (theoretically she is 48 now but BI2 was filmed in 2004). I hate how the producers didn't promote this enough they barely gave two weeks notice with TV spots and trailers there should have been more promotion and I'm sure the box office would have been better and of course it is released on a day when 3 other movies go out to theaters wide (Ice Age 2, ATL, & Slither) of the four new movies that were released BI2 was the last at the box office of the new movies! The first film made a total of $117 million in the US and it made $352 million world wide! I'm angry that people were like ""there's no point for a sequel"" good or not everyone should be happy they at least continued the franchise especially with the ending of the 1st film. Basic Instinct 2 has been a long awaited sequel for 14 years and now its finally here but they waited just too long they should have released the sequel in the late 90's, still a big gap because the 1st came out in '92. Anyways all you people out there who won't shut up about how bad this film are wrong because they probably haven't even seen it and if they saw it and still didn't like it they must have something wrong with them!",Basic Instinct 2
299,tvcn27303,everything I had hoped for,10,7 April 2006,"I am not a usual commenter on this website but seeing how underrated this movie is, I endeavour myself to write some comments and remarks about it. I had fun watching this movie, perhaps because Cat is everything I wish I could be, I am not going to post spoilers or reveal plots but there's are things that i really found amazing, the way she manipulates people it's just so divine. this is a very underrated movie, I lack of arguments here, I usually go enjoy and then speak little about it, when you go to the movies is to have fun, and i really enjoyed the 1h53 i stayed in the dark room. a must seen over and over again until the delight fades away. let's try not be so critical about it. thank you for reading.",Basic Instinct 2
300,mainman-6,Psychiatry on the line of fire,9,13 April 2006,"The Basic Instinct movies have an evil psychiatrist who is trying to do harm to Cathrine Tramell one way or the other. However, she is not the type to give up and she fights back with her best weapons, her good looks and ""magna-cumlaude"" educated brain.This movie is about free speech; about how far can you go into pushing someones ""buttons"" and who is responsible for the consequences. Why do psychiatrists have so much say about who is free and who goes to a mental institution, even if there is no proof of a crime of violence? This movie is about justice and I would call Cathrine Tramell the Dirty Harry of psychiatry.",Basic Instinct 2
301,The-SpecialTwo,Destroyed all the fond memories I have of the original film!!!,1,31 March 2006,"I was a huge fan of the original Basic Instint but this film completely annihalates the legacy of the first. Where do I even start? The plot is virtually non existent with the three dimensional Trammell from the first film turned into a pathetic caricature of what she once was, spouting awful sexual innuendoes like a cheap prostitute! David Morrissey is completely and utterly incompetent! He looks like a little boy looking for his mother, and he only serves to prove how sorely Michael Douglas' presence is missed from this film! The story is excruciating! It does not make sense in the slightest and all the actors look bored and the cheap sex scenes look like they were tacked on as an after thought. All up, I hated this movie and it is really hard to imagine any film in 2006 being worse than this!",Basic Instinct 2
302,ppolirakis,Hot! Excellent sequel!,7,2 April 2006,"I don't understand all these negative comments... Take the movie for what it is; an erotic thriller! I believe it's as good as the original, which is rare for any sequel to accomplish. The acting is outstanding! The movie is hot, and that's an understatement! It sets the mood from the beginning, and seduces you like only Stone can. Very interesting, a tangled web indeed... Morrissey is excellent is his role, and the chemistry between both is obvious from the start. They couldn't have made it any better if they tried. This is a film that will have you entranced and begging for more. It's not intended for the timid or faint, it's intention is to demonstrate the power of seduction and of the mind. As the title describes, in the end the basic instincts take control. If you liked the original, you'll love the sequel! Great job, guys!",Basic Instinct 2
303,jsica1,Great popcorn flick!!,10,3 April 2006,"I'm tired of people bashing this...it's not as bad as everyone is saying...I think people are going in expecting too much. The film is a popcorn flick and never tries to be anything more than an entertaining and over the top thriller. The language is hilarious and the sex scenes are dangerously fun. The mysterious killings are just fun to follow even though you already assume who the killer is which is pretty obvious although still never stated completely. All in all, if you just want to have a good time at the movies that's what this movie is all about. I'd recommend it to anyone who was a fan of fun '90s style thrillers like the original.",Basic Instinct 2
304,ajm600,A cracking evening's entertainment.,10,2 April 2006,"Sharon Stone is a magnificent and totally credible manipulative siren. She obviously enjoys the role and plays it full on for all it is worth. What's more, at the age of 48 she still rings the bell of every male in the audience, and most of the women too. David Morrissey looks at times like a rabbit caught in the headlights of the Stone personality, but on the whole gives a sound, satisfying performance as the psycho-analyst with a crush. The plot is always interesting and twisty enough to keep you on the edge of your seat, and the story moves along at a cracking pace. The ending leaves room for yet another sequel, and I for one can hardly wait. A cracking evening's entertainment.",Basic Instinct 2
305,a-smith-5,Biggest Basic Instinct fan sees Basic Instinct 2!!! (V.Mild spoilers),5,1 April 2006,"Let's set two things straight first.1. I love Basic Instinct (I'd rate it 8 out of 10)! The character Catherine Trammel is as good as Hannibal Lectur (apart from Thomas Harris's detailed account of Hannibal in the novel 'Hannibal' which was very detailed and deep).2. I know a good film when I see one, whether I'm a Basic Instinct fan or not! My review will be fair.So I see the trailer... didn't like it at first. Catherine seemed too blunt. In BI 1 she was subtle. After watching the trailer a good few times I got into it... but still sensed 'something's not right'.I'm VERY picky when it comes to sequels. Sequels have the chance to either expand on an already good story or make up for a bad one. Unfortunately, as most sequels do, they can also tarnish the original. Look at Star Wars the original, amazing for it's time and respected even now. It's simple storyline defining who the goodies and baddie is, through colour and family connections. Then the prequels come along :oS (I didn't like Episode 3. It was diluted, giving us a lame montage of the end of the Jedi, and a weak reason of why Anakin chose to become a Sith... oh i could so go on...) At least Episode 1 (even though disappointing as a Star Wars film, had cinematic presence... when ever Darth Maul appeared... everyone was in awe.So back to Basic Instinct 2. Thank god they got rid of the sub-title. The opening scene was very impressive. I liked how the credits appeared (something that sets the mood and pace of a film I find). Something I wanted to see in BI 2 was an acknowledgement of how she was losing control in part 1 (caring for certain people). As the audience, I wanted to empathise for her at moments, which did happen, at the beginning of her therapy lessons. Then the weak moments seeped in. The character Adam Towers... I didn't care for this character at all as he had little screen time. Detective Washburn was good. The ending is quite lame. Won't say what happens, but NO WAY as stylish as BI 1... I found the first scene with Glass and Trammel wicked. Also the open legs scene/cancel therapy had great dialogue. Jaczzi scene revealed parts of BI 1 which, as a fan is enjoyable. P.S You do figure out whether Michael Douglas's character lived or died after BI 1. It's a very subtle message but it does tell you.Major flaw with this film was the cut scenes: Where was the following scenes??1. 3-some (including Catherine's girlfriend) scene 2. ""This is all f****d up"" (Glass) 3. Extended orgy scene 4. Office sex scene 5. ""I don't know why I like you, but I do. I don't like myself for it"" in therapy. (Catherine)Shooter novel seemed a better parallel story to BI 1 than The Analyst in BI 2. The sets for Glass were good. Catherine's flat didn't impress as her mansion and beach house did in part one. Then again, London prices are unreal :oPBasic Instinct 2 does tarnish the first slightly. I won't go on about the lame ending in BI 2 but it does ruin the movie. Catherine's plan all along in this movie is as smart as the first (slightly bonkers and complex) but it works. A shame about the feeling some important scenes were cut or just should have been explained more. This is not as bad as everyone's making out. It does disappoint slightly, but still entertaining and some funny and clever lines between Glass and Catherine character. Plus a real bonus seeing so much of my own London in the film!! I was walking down one of the streets in the film pretty much when walking of the cinema!!Positives: Catherine's f*****g ruthless in this one! Very, very nasty but not as stylish.",Basic Instinct 2
306,lukegroves1986,Dark and Twisted,7,6 April 2006,"Interesting, yes, very interesting indeed. Is she the killer this time around? Or......? This is a 'Basic Instinct' film in name alone of course. What this actually is this time around is far more dark and far more twisted, without the massive, thrilling campery of the first instalment, there's a far more interesting story here. Its enticing, claustrophobic. David Morrisey carries the film, but Shazza provides excellent value. Production values are high, London looks like some hi tech Gothic nightmare. 'A soft core porn movie' Eh? What's all that about? There are exactly three brief sex scenes in the entire movie, but then maybe that's a problem for lots of people.Is this destined to be the equivalent of Alien 3 for this particular franchise?",Basic Instinct 2

Although Sharon may be 48 years old... she looks amazing! I don't care if she's as fake as a Barbie. She looks good and that's that. Basic Instinct 2 gives you everything you want from the first.

Plus Sharon's voice and trademark walk made it all the better. I was surprised at the crowds that turned up for it, but maybe that had to do with Basic Instinct 2 being at only three theaters here in Tucson, Az. I was also surprised at the good word of mouth from exiting moviegoers. I heard ""fabulous"" and ""you're in for a wild ride."" The reason I was surprised was because of all the badmouthing in the media and saying she was too old. She looked like some women I've seen in their early 30's. This film seals her status as a cinema icon and one of the great ""movie stars."" Anyway this was a good date and popcorn movie and the audience was really into it.

These days when movies receives bad ratings in general, thats normally the good ones !! So strange how things work !! I highly recommend this outstanding movie !! Please take the time and watch it !

311,hannibalxxx,Don't believe reviews...,10,6 August 2006,"...if you liked the first basic instinct you will love the second one, and in many ways it is in fact better than its predecessor. The plot is suspenseful and well thought out, and leaves the ending in as much ambiguity as to who the true murderer is as in the first film. The sex scenes although turned down compared to the first are still steamy hot and give off an edge of danger within them. The camera work is amazing giving a almost claustrophobic air to London (with actually a lot of familiar places to me seeming much more spectacular then when i see them everyday going to work!). As far as the acting goes, I thought Sharon Stone was excellent once again as Kathrin Trummel, while David Morrisey was sometimes a bit unconvincing but nevertheless carrying on the role well enough. All in all, I recommend this film to fans of the first film, while also to the fans of a more edgy sexy thriller then the average.",Basic Instinct 2

She doesn't perform memorable scenes like the opening of the legs, but the sex scenes are truly amazing for those who like to see action and appealing women. ¿David Morrisey? Puhlease. He needs a serious acting coach. The storyline is, still again, random and lost. I liked the settings and how the dark corners are entraped in this film. The script, you ask? Worse than the adapation of ""Narnia"". No intelligent lines. I ask, why did they do this? The answer: to see Sharon Stone again, in her best moment.
