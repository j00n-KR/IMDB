0,TheLittleSongbird,Love/hate...,6,21 September 2011,"The Bodyguard is an example of a movie that isn't for everyone. I personally didn't either love it or hate it, I was overall kind of eh on it. The dialogue is cheesy, the characters underdeveloped and lacking subtlety, the pace drags in the middle and the story makes little sense. However we do have some good cinematography, locations, costumes and editing, credible direction and a great soundtrack including the haunting And I Will Always Love You(and it will always be the best version no matter how many Huston wannabes try to sing it and end up murdering it). The acting is fine, Kevin Costner is good and Whitney Huston is more than credible in a role that showcases her beautiful voice excellently. Overall, The Bodyguard is a love or hate it sort of movie, but for me my reaction was mixed. 6/10 Bethany Cox",The Bodyguard
1,SnoopyStyle,A very standard movie with a little bit of corn,6,9 April 2014,"Former Secret Service agent Frank Farmer (Kevin Costner) is a no nonsense bodyguard who doesn't like to get involved with his clients or stay around too long. Rachel Marron (Whitney Houston) is a pop diva with a stalker. Her manager Devaney (Bill Cobbs) begs Frank to work for her. She is reluctantly to have the bodyguard interfere with her life, and it's obvious that they haven't told her the worst of the situation.Written by Lawrence Kasdan and directed by Mick Jackson, this is a very standard and predictable thriller. Kevin Costner is very solid as the straight laced guard. Some may downgrade the movie because of Whitney Houston. However I found her to be a good natural performer especially for someone who is untrained. She actually adds a sense of reality. There is no denying that she has the persona of a pop diva. And it helps to have her great soundtrack to prove the point. The romance is a bit corny. That's probably its biggest weak point. The movie expects a little too much from an acting novice.",The Bodyguard
2,mark.waltz,"Still a crowd-pleaser, and oh that soundtrack.",7,5 March 2021,"Take probably the most beautiful pop singer of the past 30 years, give her a slew of obvious hits to be and a thrilling story, and you've got the makings of a smash movie. Give her probably the biggest movie hero of the past 30 years, and you've got the makings of the stuff that legendary screen romance is made of. They are Whitney Houston and Kevin Costner, and once you get past the feeling that this is a forced interracial romance, you can actually see how it progresses.Her character of Rachel Maron is undoubtedly based on Houston herself, and once you get past what the press has said about her and see her safely away from the spotlight and just able to be herself, you really route for her. As she says about her reputation, it's only because of what's been said about her that she has become that way, and that's only when she feels she has no choice.Also, being surrounded by a bunch of people that won't tell you no, it's difficult not to become a little spoiled. It's amazing to watch her character express her vulnerabilities, especially when Costner insists after a night together that he shouldn't have allowed it to happen. He's very concerned about the fact that there's possibly a psycho killer after her since a slew of pasted threatening letters have come to her attention.It's rather a wistful experience seeing this again for the first time in many years because the emotions with the story and the facts of Houston's life can get in the way. But that wouldn't have mattered much had this not been a good movie and had Houston and Costner not had chemistry. You really get to see the goings on in the life of a superstar and the hassles of fame, her kindness to fans and how she treats her staff, which includes a her sister who gave up her own dreams and an adorable son whom Costner comes to adore. Ralph Waite is also memorable as Costner's father.This has many classic moments and if it is an old fashioned type of movie, that makes it all the better. A great star of the cinema gets a very funny cameo in the Academy Award sequence which is filled with tension, as is a concert scene where she is accosted by the fans watching and Costner must go into action. He's perfectly quiet yet brave knowing all eyes are on her, and she really proves herself to have star quality as an actress as well as a singer. The soundtrack is still played today, and I can see it easily standing the test of time to where it will be played still in another 30 years.",The Bodyguard
3,jboothmillard,The Bodyguard,4,8 July 2005,"Most people know about this romantic (not very thrilling) thriller film because of the number one theme song, from director Mick Jackson (Volcano). Basically former Secret Service agent turned on bodyguard Frank Farmer (Razzie nominated Kevin Costner) is hired by the manager of successful pop singer turned actress Rachel Marron (twice Razzie nominated Whitney Houston) who has recently been receiving threatening notes/letters. Farmer is haunted by the fact that he quit being a bodyguard for Ronald Reagan, just before he got shot. Farmer wants to keep his relationship with Marron professional, but he does agree to go on a date, and they do sleep together, but of course he feels this was a mistake, and she is obviously being bitchy towards him, and he knows he can't stop thinking about her ""in that way"". Rachel had been nervous going on stage during this difficult time, but you can imagine her fear on the big Oscar night when she is presenting an award, and then nominated for Best Actress, which she does win, and her assassin is certain. Rachel was saved by Frank, and he is later seen as she boards a plane with a new (older) bodyguard, but she can't take off without that big kiss. Also starring Gary Kemp as Sy Spector, I Still Know What You Did Last Summer's Bill Cobbs as Devaney, Ralph Waite as Herb Farmer, Tomas Arana as Portman, Michele Lamar Richards as Nicki, Dumb and Dumber's Mike Starr as Tony, Christopher Birt as Henry, Terminator 2's DeVaughn Nixon as Fletcher, Home Alone's Gerry Bamman as Ray Court, Batman's Robert Wuhl as Oscar Host, Debbie Reynolds and Deep Impact's Richard Schiff as Skip Thomas. Costner isn't completely believable, and as for Houston, while her singing is fantastic, her acting is lacking a lot of flare, and it is ironic that she was nominated a Razzie, and that in the film her character wins an Oscar. It just isn't my cup of tea for a thriller or love story, I found myself wondering why do so many people, particularly women, like this mediocre schmaltz, it is as the critics say (not very, in my opinion) entertaining baloney. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Song for ""I Have Nothing"", and Best Song for ""Run to You"", and it was nominated the Razzies for Worst Original Song for ""Queen of The Night"" (it's not that bad), Worst Screenplay and Worst Picture. ""I Will Always Love You"" was number 65 on 100 Years, 100 Songs, it was number 33 on The 100 Greatest Number One Singles, but also number 51 on The 100 Worst Pop Records, why? Okay!",The Bodyguard
4,moonspinner55,Corn and clichés courtesy screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan (who must have been embarrassed until the checks came in),4,3 February 2008,"Music superstar is threatened by a twisted fan and so hires a stolid bodyguard to protect her--and quickly falls in love with him. Nonsensical rubbish served as the debut acting vehicle for real-life music diva Whitney Houston, who does passable work off the stage. Kevin Costner, on the other hand, is enervated beyond belief; his brand of low-keyed machismo isn't in tune with the general air of camp inherent in this tacky scenario--he doesn't seem to be in on the joke and comes off seeming tired and indifferent. This got by with audiences via Houston's musical numbers; otherwise it is second-string stuff, with a script that makes very little sense, tossing ideas at the screen with no point or purpose. Disappointing throughout. ** from ****",The Bodyguard
5,edwagreen,The Bodyguard- I'll Always Love this Picture ****,9,13 December 2009,"Even with a weak acting performance by singer Whitney Houston, this is a fabulous film as it gives up everything: a wonderful plot, fine chemistry between Kevin Costner and Ms. Houston, the reality of finding love while on the job, and an Academy Award show never to be forgotten!The beautiful Oscar-winning song is sung here with perfection by Ms. Houston.As stated above, Houston's performance is lackluster through most of the film. It did pick up somewhat as the plot thickened. As for Costner, as the over-zealous agent, he was never better. What makes the film so good is the believable plot twists that are discovered. All does not seem to appear what it should be regarding a former agent as well as the woman who portrays Houston's sister and secretary. We have often heard of what happens when love blossoms in the work place and this film is no exception to that rule.",The Bodyguard
6,sunwarrior13,A Melodramatic Love Story,8,18 October 2012,"The Bodyguard is a romantic thriller film starring Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston. Costner stars as a former Secret Service Agent-turned- bodyguard who is hired to protect Houston's character, a music star, from an unknown stalker. Lawrence Kasdan wrote the film in the 1970's, originally as a vehicle for Steve McQueen and Diana Ross.It was directed by Mick Jackson. When imperious musical superstar Rachel Marron begins receiving death threats, she is compelled to hire a bodyguard. An ex-Secret Service agent, Frank still hasn't purged himself of his guilt feelings over his inability to protect from an assassination of the President of the United States.He is now a highly successful private and professional bodyguard who protects corporate VIPs. He is hired by Rachel's manager, Bill Devaney to protect her after she receives a number of threats against her life and a small bomb detonates in her dressing room.Gradually,Rachel and Frank fall in love. This 1992 crowd pleaser made almost as much money for Whitney Houston as its chart-busting soundtrack. A high-wattage star vehicle as only Hollywood can make as she is baring her tonsils with a rousing rendition of the Dolly Parton chestnut ""I Will Always Love You"".Overall,it is a cheesy, melodramatic potboiler with occasional moments of electricity.But nevertheless,it does contain a love story, but it's the kind of guarded passion that grows between two people who spend a lot of time keeping their priorities straight.",The Bodyguard

8,hitchcockthelegend,"I can't protect you, not like this.",7,30 October 2008,"Frank Farmer is a top line bodyguard, formerly secret service protector to President Reagan, he is approached to guard Rachel Marron, the latest pop sensation on the cusp of Hollywood domination. After initially being reluctant to take the job, Farmer gets to the task of protecting Rachel from a potential maniac who's been sending her threatening letters. As the initial in camp hostilities die down, Frank & Rachel start to draw ever closer, but so does the person who wants her dead...The Bodyguard is one of those films that was long in gestation, originally mooted in 1976 to star Steve McQueen (it was written with McQueen in mind in the 60s) and Diana Ross, it was put on the back burner after McQueen fell ill to the cancer that killed him. Then it resurfaced in 1979 with Diana Ross to play opposite Ryan O'Neal, but the two stars just couldn't get on and the project again fell by the wayside. Enter Kevin Costner and his boys at TIG Productions, original choice to star alongside Costner, Maddona, ruined her chance (thankfully) of starring after being a bitch to Costner in her Truth Or Dare documentary. In stepped Whitney Houston (brilliantly diva casting), Costner gave himself a crew cut (in homage to McQueen) and The Bodyguard went on to make $410,900,000 worldwide.The film now seems like a myth to me because the rating across many forums is on the low side, critics hate it and you will be hard pressed to find macho film fans readily about to own up to liking the picture. That's a shame because as undeniably nonsense as it is, it has got a great thriller heart to blend in with its romantic core. The good ship Bodyguard may dock at all the formula ports in the genres, but it's one hell of a journey getting to the end, even with that song that seemed to top the charts for years! (the soundtrack to the movie selling 17 million in America alone).In spite of the obviousness of the plot, and the general feeling of familiarity, The Bodyguard has much going for it, things that ensured it became a monster hit and had cinema goers queueing round the block to see it. Houston is something of a revelation, here she nails the diva bitch heart of gold portrayal of Rachel with astonishing ease, and couple that with a voice sent from some deity paradise far away, makes her total value for money. Costner also stepped up to the plate to win a new breed of fans as Farmer, his charm and laid back manner works well with a ruggedness that the male viewers could easily get on side with. The rest of the cast are merely playing second fiddle to the well matched up leads, and outside of Gary Kemp becoming increasingly annoying as the film progresses, they all blend in well to create what is now a sadly undervalued picture.See it with someone you love, don't just take my word for it, look at the box office take, it doesn't lie. 7/10",The Bodyguard
9,Theo Robertson,Jarring Jump Cuts,4,18 August 2004,"Strange as it seems the director of THE BODYGUARD is a former BBC director called Mick Jackson who made the nuclear holocaust docudrama THREADS . I say it`s strange because there surely can`t be a bigger contrast between a director`s two pieces of work . On one hand you have a very cheaply made kitchen sink drama dealing with a subject you pray will never happen , or if it does you`d hope to be vapourised in the opening exchange while on the other you have Hollywood blockbuster melodrama material (Though the plot has also popped up in several latter TVMs ) featuring love and songs and the occasional shoot out There is a stylistic connection between these two Jackson directed contrasts and that`s the jump edits . I checked the credits on both THREADS and THE BODYGUARD and was very surprised to find that different editors were used in both because the editing is very similar in its jarring quality of having a scene where noise is overwhelming followed by a scene of total silence which lasts several seconds . I guess it`s the fault of the director
As for the rest of this movie I didn`t think much of it . For a romance to work on screen you need a lot of chemistry between the two romantically linked protagonists and THE BODYGUARD features the charisma free Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston , and I was certain that the film would have worked far better if the movie was produced in the mid 1970s with Steve McQueen and Diana Ross in the main roles . It wouldn`t have saved the film from its TVM type plot but at least we`d see some convincing characterisation and acting Finally the title song is one you will either love or hate . I hate it",The Bodyguard
10,preppy-3,A boring mess,2,5 March 2008,"**POSSIBLE MINOR PLOT SPOILERS** Superstar Rachel Marron (Whitney Houston) is receiving death threats and fears for her life. She hires a high-priced but excellent bodyguard Frank Farmer (Kevin Costner). They hate each other at first but naturally fall in love. Utterly predictable and a real mess. There are so many things wrong with this movie it's hard to know where to start. First off Costner's haircut is terrible! Seriously, it's so bad you look at it in amazement. I realize he did it because Steve McQueen was originally supposed to be in it--but that's still a stupid reason. The script is just lousy--full of terrible lines and the plot really doesn't make a lot of sense. The romantic sequences between Costner and Houston are so horribly written and acted that it's almost embarrassing. Purportedly Houston and Costner got along during the filming but they don't show any sparks on the screen. The acting doesn't help. Costner plays the movie with a blank expression on his face throughout (but that DOES fit his character). Houston is a very beautiful woman and a fantastic singer--but she can't act. A few times I was actually smirking at her terrible attempts at acting. An overblown overdone mess of a movie. Very dull too.Also if you're seeing this for the music don't bother. Houston sings four songs that all became hits (especially ""I Will Always Love You"") but you never hear the full versions of the songs in the movie! You might hear the beginning and middle but never the whole thing. Despite all this though audiences in 1992 loved it. It was a huge hit and was nominated for two Academy Awards (for the music). So, use your own judgment. Also Debbie Reynolds turns in a pointless cameo.",The Bodyguard
11,dbborroughs,Better than you think it is,8,12 February 2005,"The story of a superstar singer who falls in love with her bodyguard could have been a major disaster. I remember the previews and thinking it was going to be one. However once the film was out and I actually watched it I was pleasantly surprised to find out that this is a really good romance and a really good thriller. Of course its hokey and Hollywood and all of that but you get sucked in and carried along for its running time.Trust me this is better than you think it is.The only problem is that the film is a bit too long to do what it has to do. I think the problem is in the early part of the film where all of th e pieces are being set in motion, however once its all going its great.Get some popcorn your honey and enjoy.",The Bodyguard
12,view_and_review,Excellent Pairing,7,3 April 2019,"Besides turning out a smash hit song Bodyguard was also a good movie.The stunning Whitney Houston plays Rachel Marron, an entertainer who's had threats on her life. Kevin Costner plays Frank Farmer, the no-nonsense bodyguard that's been hired to protect her. Their personalities couldn't be more different. She's loose, open, and dangerously carefree. Frank is conservative, tight-lipped, no-nonsense and all-business. They were definitely an odd couple.The storyline was a dandy and the onscreen chemistry between Costner and Houston was good. To be honest, I was surprised by Whitney Houston's acting skills. It's not an automatic that a singer can crossover no matter how accomplished of a singer she was. Michael Jackson was just passable as an actor. ""The Bodyguard"" overall was a solid production with one of the best pairings you can think of.",The Bodyguard
13,Uriah43,A Bodyguard in a Difficult Situation,6,30 August 2019,"Having recently resigned from the Secret Service, a bodyguard by the name of ""Frank Farmer"" (Kevin Costner) is offered a high-paying job protecting a musician by the name of ""Rachel Marron"" (Whitney Houston) who has recently received several serious threats upon her life. Although initially hesitant, he eventually decides to check out the situation as a matter of courtesy and is thoroughly appalled by what he finds as not only is her security greatly inadequate for the task at hand but her carefree lifestyle makes things even more difficult. Yet, despite the fact that it goes against his better instincts, he reluctantly accepts the security position-and it's then that he discovers just how precarious the situation really is. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a decent film with an interesting plot and a nice twist at the end. Along with that, I would also like to mention that this film received several awards and nominations with most of them pertaining to the musical abilities of Whitney Houston rather than her acting abilities or that of Kevin Costner. To that point, although both of them were panned by the Razzie Awards, I personally didn't think that either of them deserved this criticism. That being said, while this certainly wasn't a great film by any means, it was still entertaining for the most part and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",The Bodyguard
14,HotToastyRag,"Lousy, unless you really love Whitney Houston",1,18 June 2017,"There's really only legitimate reason to watch The Bodyguard: if you're a Whitney Houston fan. And I mean total, complete, number-one fan. Anyone else in the audience will see from the first scene that Whitney is a terrible excuse for an actress, and the plot is as thin as the romance. And, if you don't even like her music, you haven't got a chance at making it through this movie.Whitney's blatty, expressionless voice aside, this isn't a good movie. The love story of an extremely popular singer (gee, I wonder who plays her) and the man who is her bodyguard falls extremely flat. It's boring, there's no chemistry, and there's no sense of danger to even necessitate a bodyguard.So, even though Kevin Costner's a cutie, this is one to skip unless you really, really love Whitney Houston songs.",The Bodyguard
15,FlashCallahan,Im in disguise.....,8,19 June 2011,"A pop singer has been receiving threatening notes, and her manager hires a bodyguard known for his good work.The bodyguard ruffles the singer's feathers and most of her entourage by tightening security more than they feel is necessary. The bodyguard is haunted by the fact that he was on Reagan's secret service staff but wasn't there to prevent the attack by Hinckley.Eventually the bodyguard and the singer start an affair, and she begins to believe his precautions are necessary when the stalker strikes close to home.....remember back in the day when whatever film Costner was in it was Gold? well this was released at the height of his popularity, and Costner has never had a hit this huge since. Modelling himself on Steve McQueen, Costner id everything you would expect him to be.Brooding at first, but eventually becoming a man with a heart of gold and being friends with everyone. But the real reason to watch this film is Houston, and to be fair on her, she isn't all that bad, but is as what you would expect, all attitude and 'mmmm hmmmm', until you discover that she has a heart of gold too. It's just that the two of them can't swallow their prides to tell each other how they feel, until the very last frame.And somewhere in the film, there is some plot about someone wanting to kill Houston with sarcasm and threatening letters, and it's not who it would seem.It's inoffensive stuff, very easy to watch and as equally enjoyable, just don't expect too many people to admit it.",The Bodyguard
16,SimonJack,"Some drama, intrigue, crime, music and romance",6,14 February 2019,"""The Bodyguard"" has some drama, a little intrigue, crime, music and romance. That's about the best that can be said for this film. It has just enough of each to hold one's interest to the end. And, the ending makes watching this film worthwhile. It's the best part of the movie.Everyone knows, or should know, the plot. A former CIA agent is hired to protect a hot female singer. And, he falls for her and she for him. Whitney Houston is good as Rachel Marron, the big name singer. Kevin Costner is mostly wooden as Frank Farmer. I get it, as I think most movie buffs do, that a real bodyguard doing a serious job is not going to be a friendly, funny Joe with the people around him. Mike Starr's Tony, as such a glad-hand character, exaggerates that notion with his distractions for lunch, watching and enjoying the show, etc.But Costner's Farmer goes to the extreme in the opposite direction. He's almost sullen in his constant alertness. He's overly calm and slow to the point that he doesn't shoe much life or intelligence behind his apparent thinking and critical watching. The plot dances around, as do the scenes, with sharp breaks, so it doesn't have a feel of fluid continuity.One very good scene in this movie makes it worth watching. It takes place at night in the kitchen of Rachel Marron's mansion. Frank Farmer is sitting alone at a counter drinking his orange juice. He has just gotten Rachel home safely after a near riot broke out with her fans at an event. When they sped away, they left Tony behind.Now Tony kicks the door in. He's mad and goes after Frank - four times. Each time, Frank uses his martial arts and fisticuffs and lays big Tony out. Tony's face is bloody and he's about to try a fifth time with a big butcher knife. Frank picks up another knife and hurls it so that it sinks into the woodwork beside Tony's head. Tony backs down. Not a word has been spoken to this time. Frank turns to leave and says, ""I don't wanna talk about this again.",The Bodyguard
17,Mr-Fusion,Watch it to remember Whitney,6,20 December 2014,"I vividly remember the stranglehold Whitney Houston had on the closing months of 1992 because of THE BODYGUARD, but I didn't remember much about the actual movie. I wasn't expecting much, and I guess that's why it exceeded expectations. . . but only just.Whitney for the most part fits what the role requires: stuck-up, naturally über-talented; she doesn't need much range. This whole thing rests on the shoulders of whoever's playing her protector. And Costner's decent here; he gets to flex his action movie muscle with a sweet dive through a window into a crouch, although he's frequently got that anxious trying-to-remember-my-next-line look on his face (unusual for him). He's got a ridiculous character name - but also drives an El Camino. The man is complicated.But on the whole, the movie never rises above mediocrity. It's a love story without passion and the tension doesn't come until the last ten minutes of the movie (which it really needed much earlier). But I also didn't feel like quitting before the credits rolled, which kinda surprised me. I can see why it was the IT movie of its time (it's very '92, like a shot-for-MTV snapshot of the period), but staying power is not one of its virtues.6/10",The Bodyguard
18,namashi_1,Simply Superb... A Classic!,8,26 April 2010,"Mick Jackson's 'The Bodyguard' is a film that has a routine story about a Secret Service Agent turned bodyguard who is hired to protect a music icon, from an unknown stalker. Depsite zero novelty, I loved the film. It holds appeal from start to end, it keeps you interested even when the story isn't really moving. In short, a winner all the way! 'The Bodyguard' was also a Box Office Blockbuster Hit during it's release, way back in 1992. It has since gained a fan-following, it's a classic. It's Lawrence Kasdan's water-tight screenplay that keeps you glued, and Jackson's direction keep the proceedings alive. Alan Silvestri's music score, is another brownie point.Now coming to the acting department, Whitney Houston sinks her teeth into the character and brings it out like flying colors. She steals the show all the way! Kevin Costner is restrained this time, which works only to it's advantage. Gary Kemp is passable. Bill Cobbs is okay. Others fill the bill.On the whole, A Must Watch Film! Two Thumbs Up!",The Bodyguard
19,JamesHitchcock,Adequate Thriller-Romance,6,20 July 2006,"I was interested to note from your ""Trivia"" page that it was originally intended to make this film in the seventies with Steve McQueen and Diana Ross in the leading roles, but that the film never got made because it was ""too controversial"". The cause of the controversy was presumably the mixed-race love-affair between Frank and Rachel, as there is little else in the script that might upset anyone. The story centres around Frank Farmer, a former Secret Service agent now working as a private bodyguard. He is hired by Rachel Marron, an African-American pop star, who has been receiving death threats, presumed to come from a mad stalker. Frank's obsessive concern with security initially alienates both Rachel and some of the other members of her entourage, but, after a number of misunderstandings, he becomes first her friend and then her lover. He, however, is unhappy about becoming emotionally involved with a client and ends the affair. He would also like to end his employment with Rachel, but she is becoming genuinely frightened for her own safety, and he agrees to stay on to protect her when it is clear that she is in danger from an unexpected source.When I first saw this film in the cinema I disliked it. I was a great admirer of Kevin Costner's performance in ""Dances with Wolves"", and I went to see ""The Bodyguard"" in the hope that it would be a film of similar scope and vision. Of course, it isn't, but then it was never intended to be. Having seen it again recently on television, I was rather more impressed than I had been the first time. There is a respectable performance from Costner as Frank, a man who on the surface seems cold and detached but who hides his emotions under the surface- not only his love for Rachel, but also his feelings of guilt stemming from the assassination attempt on President Reagan in 1981. Frank was not on duty at the time- in fact, he was attending his mother's funeral- but he cannot escape from the thought that, if he had been present, he could have prevented the President from being shot.Whitney Houston is a beautiful woman, with a beautiful voice which was shown off to good advantage in this film. Her rendition of ""I Will Always Love You"" is one of the most haunting ballads I know, far superior to the Dolly Parton original. Her character is supposed to be an actress as well as a singer- the finale actually takes place as she receives a ""Best Actress"" award at the Oscars. Unfortunately, it seems unlikely that Whitney will ever emulate her alter ego in this respect, as her acting is certainly not in the same class as her voice. She seems to have too small an emotional range, and it is no surprise that her subsequent film career has been so patchy. ""The Bodyguard"" is a perfectly adequate thriller-romance, if at times too slow-moving, but I felt that it might have been better with a more commanding female lead. 6/10",The Bodyguard
20,Smells_Like_Cheese,"It started off pretty good actually, but then the plot slid down after the first half the film",5,27 June 2007,"Ah, The Bodyguard, I was 7 years old when this film was released, and the funny thing about it is that I actually remember all the hoop-la there was about it. Well, mostly what I remember is how much my mom and sister complained about it's hit song by Whitney Housten, I will Always Love You, was way too over played on the radio. Hence the reason why I never saw this film, well, I passed it at Hollywood Video and I figured I would see what it was about and if it really should of got all the praise that it did in 1992. Now when the film started out, I was actually surprised, I found myself enjoying it, but then it got into a mystery thriller that wasn't really needed in my opinion, that wasn't explained very well or wasn't even enjoyable.Frank is one of the best bodyguards around, he has protected some very important people in his life, but he refuses celebrities. But when a superstar, Rachel Marron, is getting death threats, her assistant begs him to join the team. One problem, Rachel is a bit of a diva, big surprise. Her and Frank keep clashing but can no longer hide their deep sexual tension for each other and give in. But Frank must remember that he is here to protect Rachel and save her life and protect her family as well.The Bodyguard had it's moments and a very promising plot that could have worked, but unfortunately what happened with the character, Rachel's sister, just got too confusing among with the friend of Frank. You'll see what I mean when you see the film. I'm not sure if I would recommend this film or not, but I do think it's worth a look. But I agree with my mom and sister, I did fast forward through the singing moments, no offense, Whitney.5/10",The Bodyguard
21,DKosty123,Great Song and Creepy Irony,6,25 February 2013,"I Will Always Love You will be remembered for a long time with this movie. In fact, singers imitating Whitney Houston are still winning Karoke Contests using this song 20 years later. The power of this song is perhaps more powerful than the film itself.Still I would argue this film is one of the roles which helped establish Kevin Costner's career as he is excellent in his title role. Whitney Houston gets to play herself in a lot of ways here which makes her acting very effective. There is a lot good about this film.The creepy part is hindsight. While the body guard in this has to deal with an insane killer trying to shoot Whitney, the reality is she really needed a bodyguard for an entirely different reason - to stop her substance abuse. Her line ""I am not a morning person"" is one of the cliché lines of a person with that problem. That makes the film creepy in a real retrospect fashion.When you look at Houston in this film, she looks as great as she ever has. She is actually portrayed as a beautiful young rock star who her fans and a lot of others would fall in love with. I have the same feelings for her here as many would in that her character portrays success in the way that it is often achieved, at the loss of a personal life for the star. The script then exploits that perfectly by having her fall in love with her Bodyguard. That makes all too much sense and I have felt often that singers who die too soon tragically like Houston has fit the way the script is written like a glove.",The Bodyguard

Coaster or Farmer walks around looking so deadpan throughout most of the movie that he seems to be suffering from a serious case of shell shock from his previous job as a secret service agent. It's a habit that he picked up over the years guarding both Presidents Carter and Regan in him being able to blend in with the furniture or background in him remaining inconspicuous, to any attempted assassins, on he job. Taking on an assignment at the insistence of his good friend Mr. Dewaney, Bill Cobbs, to be Miss Marron's personal bodyguard the company that he surrounds herself with get so intrusive in him doing his job that he almost quits before he begins. It's Rachel's sweet looks and bubbling personality that keeps him on the job guarding her and also the fact that those in her entourage of flunkies and hanger on being so completely incompetent in doing their jobs that makes him stay.We and Farmer know right away that someone out there is trying to do Rachel in but that fact is kept from her by those around her that makes Farmer's job that much more difficult. Acting as if she doesn't have a care or fear in the world Rachel doesn't realize that her life and body, the body that Farmer is guarding with his life, is in serious danger. It's only much later when Rachel gets a disturbing pone call, on her private phone number, that she finally gives in and lets Farmer do his job protecting her life. It's her obsessed fan and stalker who's planning to whack her at the biggest moment in Rachel's life when she's to accept the Academy Award for best actress with over a billion people watching the great event live and on TV all over the globe.***SPOILERS*** The love angle in the movie doesn't quite pan out with Farmer and Marron never really clicking in their love scenes that come across mechanical and not genuine at all. Farmer for one is so intense in all of his scenes that showing affection towards Rachel seems out of character for him in the movie. It's only in the last few moments that Farmer gets his act together in realizing who's out to knock off Rachel that he really seems to care for Rachel and tries to save her life even at the expense of his own. But by then she's so turned off by his almost zombie or robot like action that she almost allows her intended killer to do her in by not believing or responding to Farmers frantic attempts to save her life.Both Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston as Frank Farmer & Rachel Marro did their best to make their parts in the movie work and the final payoff with a by then a disgraced, in letting things get out of hand, Farmer saving Rachel's life which saved the film from being total disaster. It was sad that the film ""The Bodyguard"" in a way predicted its star Whitney Houston's actual death some 20 years later in 2012. It was then just like in the movie Whitney faced death this time in her hotel bathtub, not from an assassin's bullet, just before she was to receive a Grammy for her music like an Academy Award for her acting in ""The Bodygurad"". But this time in real life not in the movies the outcome was sadly a lot different.",The Bodyguard
23,Robert_duder,"An undeniable classic thriller, Costner at the very height of his career",7,24 September 2012,"The Bodyguard was always one of my favourite Costner flicks. I am a huge Costner fan even though he has slipped from Hollywood stardom in the last few years. I hadn't seen The Bodyguard in awhile and wanted to review it so I sat down to enjoy it again. I was surprised to discover that I found it a little slow at times, that it looked a little dated, and while I still enjoyed my favourite parts, the grainy and gritty romantic thriller definitely ages itself. But don't let that discourage you. The film is still a classic of its time. The pace of the film is definitely methodical, it doesn't apologize for taking its time to really lay out the characters and the mystery surround the stalker. The characters are all very well developed and the chemistry between Costner and Houston is really what makes this film, and the music of course. Houston's soundtrack to the film is formidable, and brilliant and you buy her as an insanely successful pop princess because she was and still is.Kevin Costner's Frank Farmer is this brooding, seemingly hardened former Secret Service agent. He enters the film mysteriously but you learn more about him throughout the film. Its really a great character and I can't imagine for minute anyone other than Costner playing the role. The late and legendary Whitney Houston plays Rachel Marron. She's the hot headed, short tempered diva but her character takes a lot of turns too and she definitely becomes more likable though she really does remain a diva throughout. Her and Costner are just sexy and brilliant together. The film has a terrific supporting cast including Bill Cobbs, Gary Kemp, Tomas Arana and Mike Starr should be called out for especially strong supporting performances. Michele Lamar Richards does an okay job as Marron's sister Nicki. I always thought she was one of the poorer performances in the film which is really unfortunate especially being what a big important part she has in the film. DeVaughn Nixon does a decent job as Marron's son Fletcher.Everyone works very well together and some of the chemistry (as previously mentioned) is truly great while others go a little understated like Houston and Richards as sisters. Director Mick Jackson was really just getting his legs under him when he directed this film. He does a good job, his direction is decent, but the pacing could have definitely been better handled by more experience. I think he got lucky with a strong cast, especially the stars, and a well written story. Regardless of its few flaws and its slow pace, The Bodyguard is a nineties classic and must see viewing for Costner fans and Houston fans. Its the perfect romantic thriller for a quiet date night. 7/10",The Bodyguard
24,ElMaruecan82,One of the most emblematic romances of the 90's ...,8,21 November 2013,"1992 left two romantic moments for cinematic posterity, both musically immortalized: the magic carpet ride in ""Aladdin"" where ""A Whole New World"" opened itself to Jasmine's dazzled eyes, and Kevin Costner protecting Whitney Houston from the riot that just interrupted her concert. While the song is never heard at that moment, we all visualize it with ""I Will Always Love You"" playing in the background. That image of Houston in Costner's arms is one of the most defining of the romantic nineties, Houston's feet never touched the ground but her soul touched our hearts forever and even more after her untimely passing, last year.It's the mark of great movies to be able to capture the soul of a relationship by only using the simplicity of images and music: a film like ""Titanic"" will always be remembered for the flying-over-the-boat moment and ""My Heart Will Go On"", ""Ghost"" for the pottery scene erotically conducted with the ""Unchained Melody"", and ""Dirty Dancing"" when Johnny gives Baby the time of her life after putting her off the corner, and so on and so forth. And whether the film is good or bad becomes almost pointless when it reaches such a classic status. Cinema is not a rational world you know, imagery, lyrics, music have their 'word' to say and sometimes it transcends any attempt of an objective reasoning.My tone is partly defensive because I'm aware of ""The Bodyguard""'s reputation, I know that the film met with mixed to negative critics, that it was panned for its formulaic story, for the wooden performance of Kevin Costner, the eternal Razzie's scapegoat, and even Whitney Houston, didn't escape from criticism. ""The Bodyguard"" would almost need a bodyguard of critic to reply to its harsh disapproval. But I believe a film is also to judge in retrospect, at the light of what it has become and what has generally become of Cinema for the years after. Take all the movies I mentioned, with the exception of ""Titanic"", a few romances ever make it now to the top highest grossing films of the year. We thought the 90's to be 'cynical' but in comparison with the 2010's, it's the 60's.Today, most successful films are action blockbusters / Pixar / Marvel adventures' adaptations or successful franchises, the recipe for success is clearly established, and a film like ""The Bodyguard"" wouldn't have necessarily worked or even been considered to be made. Take the script, written 20 years before the release (for Steve McQueen and Diana Ross as the leads): a former ex-Secret Service Agent is assigned to protect a pop star whose life is threatened by a stalker, the material is simple but it's only through the casting that Mick Jackson elevates it, by confronting two of the then most inevitable faces of show-business. Costner is Frank Farmer and Houston Rachel Marron, but we all know she's playing herself, like Ava Gardner in ""The Barefoot Contessa"", she gets a role tailor-made for her, and a powerful testimony for the person, that she was.Marron is Houston, and vice versa, a diva whose talent and unique voice brought her on the top of the billboards and the kind of spotlight that unveils the darkest side of stardom. As Costner said in his eulogy: ""anyone could have played the leading man, but only Whitney Houston could have played that part""; in one sense, he was right, even a star like Madonna wouldn't have fit the film. She already played in movies, which would have damaged her credibility as a 'vulnerable' star. Houston showed enough strength to convince us as a diva (because she was one) but she was fragile enough to need a strong shoulder to put her head on. But Costner is wrong about himself, he always cherished lone-ranger roles, men who combined both competence and high morality, with a wound in his past, so only him or a younger Clint Eastwood could have made it work.And both Costner and Houston make it work. And the film never treats the interracial romance as if it was relevant to the story, but nevertheless it accentuates the gap between the two characters. He works in secrecy, she's a star, he takes his job in a no-nonsense way, she embraces celebrity with full arms, knowing that it's part of her competence to be available to the crowd of fans. These contradictions create many situations where they have to make the rules, to adapt to each other, but we know these scenes are only meant to make their chemistry grow slowly and surely until the romance finally blooms. The romance is convincing because it starts as respect, understanding, and empathy to the point of when it happens, we don't feel it contrived, but as natural, exhilarating and passionate as the song that defines it.Indeed, ""I Will Always Love You"" is the darlings of Karaoke and the ultimate test in musical reality programs, and that's a credit to Whitney Houston's miraculous talent for having made both the opening and conclusion, such milestones in the world of music. It was Costner who picked the original Dolly Parton's song and suggested Houston should remake it. That fact alone proves that his casting was a blessing. ""The Bodyguard"" is as great as a film can get in terms of impact, and music enhances it to an extraordinarily emotional level, being till now, the all-time best-selling soundtrack.Naturally, ""The Bodyguard"" was nominated for every Razzie Award possible, but like I said for ""Mommie Dearest"", some films stick in our mind, no matter how seemingly bad they are for some pompous critics, and that's the kind of achievement some 'greater' movies fail to achieve. The only difference is that I called ""Mommie Dearest"" a guilty pleasure, while I don't feel so guilty for having enjoyed ""The Bodyguard"".",The Bodyguard
25,cricketbat,Not as bad as everyone made it out to be,7,11 September 2020,"As familiar as I am with this soundtrack, I've never actually seen The Bodyguard movie until now. I don't think it's as bad as everyone has made it out to be. Yes, Whitney Houston's acting is inconsistent and yes, there isn't much chemistry between her and Kevin Costner, but it's an entertaining story with some tense moments. Plus, the soundtrack really is good.",The Bodyguard
26,callanvass,"Overblown, and surprisingly dull Romantic/Thriller, with only a few entertaining moments *spoilers*",6,28 June 2007,"The Bodyguard is an OK film, but nothing particularly exciting, I am usually a huge fan of Costner's but here he pretty much bored me, and Whitney Houston should really stick to singing, plus while there are a few memorable moments, like the finale at the award ceremony, I found the killer to be quite predictable. Costner and Houston's chemistry was really lacking, and it's also way over long for it's own good, plus I am surprised this was the huge box office hit it was. It does have a few tense moments here and there, and Costner has a couple good scenes, however the ending is too stupid, as I felt there kiss was too passionate!. None of the characters were particularly likable, and this deserves it's low rating it has, plus the dialog was quite boring in my opinion. This had the potential to be a great entertaining film, but it's ruined by over length, and dullness, and characters we can't give a damn about, so Overall it's worth a watch i suppose but don't go out of your way to see it. **1/2 out of 5(barely)The Acting is OK. Kevin Costner is alright here, but not at his best, I think he is a great actor, but here he is mostly dull, as is his character, he tried to come off as a Bodyguard who was tough, but I simply didn't buy it, he had a couple of good scenes, but he was mostly miscast. Whitney Houston is so so in her 1st major role, she's definitely good at the singing, but acting she's not that great at, I didn't buy her role, and her character got on my nerves. Gary Kemp plays his annoying selfish role well as Sy. Bill Cobbs is good in his role as Devaney and did what he had to do well. Tomas Arana is OK in his role, and did a decent job near the end. Michele Lamar Richards is OK as the selfish sister she did decent. Mike Starr is alright as Tony and brought some comic relief. DeVaughn Nixon is a cute kid, and did fine in his role.",The Bodyguard
27,851222,The Ultimate Guilty Pleasure,9,14 September 2016,"Greetings from Lithuania.""The Bodyguard"" (1992) is a wonderful drama / thriller / romance. It is not cheese romance by a mile, you can point your finger at any direction these days and find much, much more cheese movies then this one. Acting was solid by all involved, but especially of course by our leads Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston - we do care for these two sharply drawn characters. Directing was solid as well as involving script. And the outcome with the killer wasn't the for me the ultimate ending of the story - it surely was that plane scene.Overall, two great charismatic leads, involving writing and amazing (one of the kind) music makes this a very cool movie. It has some romance, it has some thrills and its all done in a very good way - add the unforgettable soundtrack and ""The Bodyguard"" becomes the ultimate guilty pleasure.",The Bodyguard
28,ironhorse_iv,"I will always love you, movie, even if you're a bit mediocre.",6,24 April 2015,"Houston, we don't have a problem. At least, not in 1992. In 1992, both Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston could do no, wrong. At the time, Kevin Costner was one of America's most accomplished thespians and Whitney Houston was one of the most popular singers. When you combine them, in the movie, 'the Bodyguard'. You get a semi-OK-masterpiece. This schmaltzy proposal for this film was rejected 67 times before Kevin Costner got the rights. It was originally written by Lawrence Kasdan for Steve McQueen and Diana Ross in the 1970s. Directed by Mick Jackson, the movie tells the story of Frank Farmer (Kevin Costner), a former Secret Service Agent for the President, who became the private bodyguard for international pop star and actress, Rachel Marron (Whitney Houston) after she been, receiving death threats from a dangerous stalker. Can Frank save Rachel or will the killer win out in the end? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling too much of the film, I found Kevin Costner's acting in this, pretty dull. I know, that his character is supposed to be stern, but gees they could have, lighten up, the character, a bit. Even, in the lake scenes. He was pretty blend. Despite, that, he made a pretty realistic bodyguard. He was also, a pretty cool, action star at the time. He deserve more credit for this movie, from stopping it from totally tanking with his action scenes. The scene where he was chasing the killer, through the woods was intense. Kevin Costner was so insistent that Whitney Houston and no other black singer/actress play the part that the film production waited 1 year for Whitney to be available to film. In my opinion, it was a good choice. She was a good singer, but not a good actress, even when seemingly playing a variation of herself. Whitney Houston as Rachel, was mediocre, at best. I give her some credit, for at least, trying to act. She did suffered a miscarriage during production and missed a couple of weeks of production recovering, and you can't tell, by her performance, how truly depress, she must have, been at the time. I just glad, Whitney Houston's character wasn't playing like a gimmicky black singer stereotype. Still, most of the movie, I felt that her character was a bit annoying. Even, test audiences, couldn't stand all, her b*tching as the film had to undergo some hasty re-cutting. Still, with those cuts, her character never truly understood, how much, she was in danger, even when, things became really serious and it bugs the living hell out of me. I know, she supposed to play a diva, but I didn't like, how much, Rachel and Frank fought against each other over, how much protection, she needs. It made the romance seem so unrealistic. I didn't think, that the actors have that much chemistry on film. Still, they both look, beautiful, together. One thing that I kinda love about the film, is how brave, the filmmakers were in showing interracial relationships. Even in the 1990s, seeing this was rare. Houston's mainstream appeal allowed people to look at the movie color-blind, and never once, did I find the fact that a black woman and white guy falling in love, jarring. Still, controversy arose as some felt the film's advertising intentionally hid Houston's face to hide the film's interracial relationship. I think, this was made to keep, the movie from being spoiled. The reason The Bodyguard scored more than $410 million worldwide is not, because of the two stars sex appeal. It's the film soundtrack, which to date, as of this writing, stands as the highest selling in movie history. It features six songs by Whitney Houston, including ""Queen of the Night,"" a remake of Chaka Khan's ""I'm Every Woman,"" ""I've Got Nothing,"" and, of course, her signature cover of Dolly Parton's ""I Will Always Love You."" Although her songs make up half of the soundtrack, she is credited for the album's popularity, which in turn drove people to see the film. Two songs from the film, ""Run to You"" and ""I Have Nothing"", were nominated for an Oscar for Best Original Song. While, 'I will always love you' got her, multiply rewards and became one of the best-selling single by a woman in music history. The character of Rachel was originally going to sing ""What Becomes of the Broken Hearted"" instead of ""I Will Always Love You"", before 1991's film, Fried Green Tomatoes used the former song. Kevin Costner is the one who wanted the song written by Dolly Parton to be sung by Whitney Houston. He convinced Whitney to sing it ""a capella"" for the movie. Whitney's rendition became so good, that Dolly Parton pretty much, disowned it and gave it to Whitney. Regardless of whether you're a Houston fan, her talent as a singer is what makes the movie halfway watchable. If this movie was made today, it might be an all-out-disaster. Both celebrities went into a shaky time in the late 1990s/early 2000s. While, Whitney Houston's career never really, bound-back, to the success of this film and its soundtrack. She did have some minor hits, before dying in 2012, in a drowning/drug overdose accident. Kevin Costner was able to have some success after his double whammy of post-apocalypse sci-fi flops movies in the mid-1990s, and his career is still going strong. In many ways, he always thought of this movie, as one of his greatest works, and always felt open in making a sequel or remaking it. Celebrities like Rihanna, and Princess Diana was once sought for re-dos. Who knows, if a sequel will be made? Overall: Yes, it could had been better, but I quite enjoyed the film. I do recommended, at least, seeing it, once. In the end, if you don't bother watching the film. At least, try to listen to the soundtrack. You'll probably enjoyed it.",The Bodyguard

It is an enjoyable movie, I happen to have watched it a lot in recent years, and I always like it, but I can go years without feeling the need to revisit it.It is hard to say what I don't like, as it's nothing in particular, I just find the directing a bit flat, and at times the actors are poorly framed. I remember I loved it when it was released, but by the time I watched it again on video, my opinion if it, had dropped considerably. The soundtrack is very effective, all the new songs are catchy and for the second year in a row, the single to a KC movie dominates the charts. I knew the song I Will Always Love You from the Burt Reynolds/Dolly Parton movie The Best Little Whorehouse In Texas. And whilst I still call it a Dolly Parton song, I know many call it a Whitney Houston one, and think of her version as the definitive one. Of the cast, in her first movie Houston is very good. I'm surprised she didn't make more movies (she only made 4 more) as the talent was there. It's another less is more performance from KC, similar to his performance in The Untouchables, but it's still effective here, and he has some good, witty lines. All the supporting cast are fine too. The film had to undergo some hasty re-cutting when test audiences hated the original ending with Farmer dying after saving Marron. I remember KC saying in an interview, that he didn't even understand the new ending to the movie. Sadly for me the tacked on happier ending ruins things a bit!! As Farmer is clearly shot in the chest and gut at Oscars, but he turns up at the airport with his arm in a sling. It was another $100 million plus grosser for KC as The Bodyguard finished the year the 7th highest grossing movie of 1992, with a domestic gross of $121 million. 8/10 for this reviewer.",The Bodyguard

Houston, as the latter, is impressively good given it's her film debut, I really enjoy her performance throughout the 129 minutes.That aforementioned run time is probably too long, as the film does drag its legs as the third act is on the horizon; everything before and after that moment is entertaining, though.

One day, while waiting at a bus station, I overheard two friends talking about a movie called 'The Bodyguard' and that how good that was, how they enjoyed it and how Withney Houston shone in it.
Years passed, I lived my life, but I always had memory of that conversation in the back of my mind as if waiting for the right moment and opportunity to grab and watch that film.
And opportunity it came one day with its video from a friend. I put the cassette in the player and started watching the anticipated movie with unbelievable excitement and happiness.And the movie rolled over me like an avalanche...That was a rollercoaster of emotions, chemistry, love, acting, music and one of the best and unique voices of the 20th century that I experienced.That was one of the most beautiful and heartwarming movies that I have ever had the pleasure to watch.Kevin Costner and Withney Houston were just diamond-like in it and outshone themselves in every aspect.Tears are appearing in the corners of my eyes as I am writing this review. This is a review full of memories of my youth as well as the rainbow of true emotions that were conveyed by the eternally alive comet called The Bodyguard.Withney, I've always loved you.

42,gcd70,Costner's Midas Touch,6,2 November 2007,"Definitely not one of Kevin Costner's stronger films, however he certainly seems to turn everything he touches into gold. His record of choosing successful scripts seems impeccable.In ""The Bodygaurd"", Costner plays somewhat reluctant minder Frank Farmer, who is assigned to watch over Rachel Marron (Whitney Houston), a celebrity of music and movie fame. Kevin Costner fills the shoes well, but he's never impressive, while always playing second fiddle to Whitney Houston, whose screen debut is good, but hardly great.Director Mick Jackson does manage to give his audience a good feeling in this film, which is best noted for Ms. Houston's wonderful title song.Saturday, February 13, 1993 - Croydon Twin Cinema",The Bodyguard
43,Boyo-2,Liked their kiss at the end...,4,19 February 2002,"..but unfortunately it took over two hours to get to it.  Its a great moment and is very old-movie in its execution, but the movie preceeding it is mostly awful.  Don't read this if you want your 'experience' ruined..Kevin & Whitney have some moments of genuine chemistry. He is hired by her staff because she is receiving threatening letters and intruders (she's a double threat - big in movies and in music - just like Neely O'Hara!) but she is mostly being kept in the dark about her stalker because she might get 'upset.'  Her staff is comprised of shady characters, all designed to make you think any of them could be guilty of stalking.She wants her freedom but he's very professional - he worked for the CIA and still regrets not being on duty the day Ronald Reagan was shot - so They Clash, so that they can Overcome That and Become Romantic.  Inexplicably, his professional responsibility is put aside and he decides to accept her invitation to go on a date.  Being that she is a huge star, its unreasonable that she is never recognized, but I digress..He realizes that they should not have gotten close the Following Morning, and she is angry that they won't be waking up together anymore.  When the threats take a more serious tone, they agree to get serious about her being guarded.  You don't want to know the rest.  See the fey dye-blonde guy who is obsessed with Whitney.  See the co-worker of Costner trying to get some of what Kevin was given.  See the resentful sister/secretary seething at every turn.
The best is the Oscars ceremony at the end, where she wins, but is almost gunned down..maybe the killer was pulling for someone else in her category!
The script is a mess.  Costner is wooden for the most part.  Houston is very good but has a lapse in some heavily dramatic scenes.  I don't think playing a spoiled diva is a huge stretch for her but its good to know your own limitations, too.  As mentioned, the finale is very well done, very emotional and cathartic. Its the only spontaneous, real moment in a mostly artifical movie.  5/10.",The Bodyguard

47,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,A thriller that needs to find a main focus,5,7 July 2012,"Romantic thrillers can work, they just need to have good direction. But for this film, directed by Mick Jackson, did not keep a steady eye on where the plot had to be. Much of the time I was trying to figure out what on earth was happening with the plot that seemed to go on endlessly.The story of the bodyguard is about Frank Farmer (Kevin Costner), a veteran in the art of protection and now only takes care of special VIPs. Sadly, the character of Farmer is so thinly written that nothing ever changes for the better in this man. His entire outlook on his job is strictly to be emotionless. The audience isn't even explained to why the only beverage he drinks is a glass of orange juice.Co-starring Costner is Whitney Huston, a pop culture icon ironically playing a fictional pop culture icon named Rachel Marron. Her character is eccentric and snobby but it works. At least she tries to excite Mr. Farmer, but even she is not able to get him to come out of his cage of cautiousness. It's almost as though the lines written for Huston's character were supposed to be more entertaining than Costner's.The problem with these two characters is that the connection between them just didn't feel or look like it was there. That and the fact that the film focused more on these two people more than the plot. The main plot here was to about Farmer protecting Marron from a psychotic killer whom when, on screen, seemed like he had some serious issues. Turns out though, this creep is hardly ever focused on at all. And it's because of this that the tension in this ""romantic thriller"" is lost. Nothing gets tense at all until the finale.The music, which was for the majority of the time provided by Huston, nonetheless has energy but all this does is support the fact that Huston is better at singing. Of course her acting is good but her voice is the top gun that she has. The rest of the score was produced by Alan Silvestri and once again, just like Unlawful Entry (1992), was a let down by the fact that there was not enough music to keep the scenes tight. But then again, who could blame him; how could you produce a score for a thriller film that rarely focuses on the thriller aspect of it?Huston isn't bad at acting here but all this does is prove that she should stick to singing. Not to mention, the lack of balance in romance and thriller makes this film hard to enjoy.",The Bodyguard
48,Easygoer10,Woeful Film,4,30 September 2020,"This is a bad film. Many people are not aware Steve McQueen wanted to make it in the 1970s. Kevin Costner sites McQueen as his primary influence (along with thousands of other people) to become an actor. Although this was box office smash, I can't stand it. It's complete trash. I like Costner; especially ""Dances With Wolves"". However, couldn't make a patch on McQueen's trousers when it comes to acting ability, machismo, or any other way",The Bodyguard
49,PredragReviews,"""Reagan got shot! - Not on my shift!""",8,25 May 2016,"This movie has a dark atmosphere, which is something I love about it. It's not like most love stories. This movie is so different from a typical romance film. It doesn't just focus on the romance, it focuses on Rachel's career, the stalker, Frank's resistance to grow close to his client. That's what makes this movie so special. ""The Bodyguard"" is one of Whitney's best performances. You can tell she is in her prime with her career. She and Kevin Costner are outstanding in their performances. I love the performances throughout the movie most..Kevin Costner portrays Frank Farmer, a no-nonsense bodyguard hired by the singers associates that struggles with Marron's devotion to her career and her own deluded view that she is invincible. Houston plays a character that parallels her real life, an accomplished actress and singer who is being stalked by an obsessive fan. Bodyguard was to be the big vehicle to launch Houston into a mega film career. Although Houston's performance is commendable for her first film effort, her shining moments in the film are when she showcases the soundtrack, which is incredible. Costner is strong in his stern, powerful role. If you like a who-done-it film, amazing music, watching Kevin Costner, as well as just the right mix of romance and damsel in distress, you've got to get The Bodyguard (and get the soundtrack while you're at it).Overall rating: 8 out of 10.",The Bodyguard

The plot is intriguing enough to carry the film through and the romance between Costner and Houston builds steadily and realistically.With some decent action scenes, a decent cast and a great soundtrack, i found the Bodyguard to be an enjoyable movie.Clearly this film is not for everyone, it doesn't have enough action to satisfy the action fans, it isn't thrilling enough to be a thriller and as a pure romance film it is fairly weak; but i have to admit it does balance between these 3 genres quite well without excelling in any one of them.7/10",The Bodyguard
52,Howlin Wolf,He's got her covered.,7,9 August 2007,"Two professionals of different kinds. One who has to cultivate an outgoing and accessible air because that's how she makes her living, and one who keeps his emotions in and tries wherever possible to stay in the background as part of his. Mutual attraction will place limits on both of their lives - if they manage to stay safe for long enough, that is...Costner is well-suited to playing the stoic and intense action man, and casting Whitney Houston as a singer allows her a fairly comfortable start in the movies. They make an appealing enough couple and their chemistry together is of the simmering type. Some have criticised the leading female, but I believe her underplaying works well enough that we can glimpse a vulnerable dimension to her character.The whole thing seems content to serve as a glossy potboiler for the shameless romantic - and help to shift millions of soundtrack units along the way, of course. It's something of an easy sell, I suppose, but I'm still left admiring how it's packaged. A triple handkerchief affair for some females, no doubt, but it's flashy enough in certain spots to be of moderate interest to the guys too.

And Whitney Houston could really act, fragile and tough at the same time. I have reservations about Kevin Costner as an actor, but somehow he is right in this film and apparently wanted to act with Houston a lot. The plot is simple, but exciting to watch and the electricity between Costner and Huston is erotic, beautiful to see and the tender love scene with what looked like a samurai sword between them riveting to watch. Caught this on a UK channel. and it is rarely showed. A fine film that should be seen and shown on television more often in the UK than it is. I liked it back in 1992 and I like it even better now. A lot of details like the fund raising event for AIDS showed how exactly the film was aware of its time. Dramatic, tender and well worth re-evaluation.",The Bodyguard
54,mattymatt4ever,"The soundtrack is outdated, but the movie's still good",7,23 September 2002,"I saw this movie when it was first released and didn't really care for it. Well, basically I was still in grade school and didn't care for anything that wasn't loaded with action or comedy.  I gave this movie another try when it came on Cinemax and recorded it on tape.  It's a very impressive film that's both suspenseful and romantic, without being over-the-top.  The only thing that really bugged me was the soundtrack.  My cousins upstairs bought the soundtrack and would listen to it constantly, so I'm pretty much tired of hearing every single one of those songs.  Kevin Costner gives an engaging, charismatic performance.  Whitney Houston is not a terrific actress, but she can pull of a dramatic line without making me burst into laughter.  So I gotta give her a little bit of credit, being that this was her first performance.  I've seen much worse.  And it's nice to see Whitney looking very pretty, as opposed to now where she's destroying herself with drugs.  And though the relationship was between a white man and a black woman, the film didn't get preachy about it. 
I just think Lawrence Kasdan (who wrote the script) should've just made Whitney's character a singer, since we never see her act in this film.  We never see clips of her films.  All we see her do is sing.  So why not make her a singer and have the climax at the Grammy Awards?  Nevertheless, I really enjoyed the film.  It works well as both a love story and a thriller. And unlike most romantic films, the two characters don't constantly jump into bed together and the sex is left to the imagination.  We actually feel some real chemistry, through dialogue and character development.

55,one9eighty,and IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII-E-IIIIIII.... don't really like this over rated film,4,27 July 2018,"Starring Whitney Houston and Kevin Costner, who were both at the height of their star power this film is about a diva singer and her bodyguard. When Rachel (Houston) Marron's life is threatened, Frank Farmer (Costner) is hired to defender her. He is ex-secret service and she's a world famous pop tartlet. To co-exist they and survive they develop a special bond. This film looks at the relationship and all the drama along the way, as well as following the murder plot to take Rachel down and how Costner plans to thwart it. I have to admit, I wasn't really a fan, maybe it's because it's a blatant chick flick - or maybe it's the soundtrack song by Whitney Houston that makes me shudder every time I hear it - putting me off the film. The plot isn't that complex and there isn't really any sexual tension or chemistry between the two stars - which is a surprise as the whole premises is the whole 'will they/wont they', 'do they/ don't they' between the two potential lovers. They aren't that engaging as characters and I didn't care less what happened to them throughout the film. Where Houston and Costner are authentic is in their individual persona delivery - Costner is supposed to be fairly dull and bland - which I believe; and Houston is supposed to be a bratty diva - which I could also have believed. This felt more like a vehicle for Houston's vocal talent than a real attempt at a film. Overrated and not my cup of tea. I can't say it's a terrible film as some production value has gone into it and at least it's got a linear enough narrative to follow. 4 out of 10 from me.",The Bodyguard

Costner as Frank Farmer is haunted throughout the film about failing to stop President Reagan being shot in 1981 even though he wasn't on duty for g
honest reasons at the time. Now he protects private individuals and for the first time a high flying spoilt pop star who doesn't realise just how much danger she is in.Costner was riding a career high at this stage of his career before it came to a shudder with Waterworld (1995).Houston displays her immense singing abilities and her debut acting performance before her untimely death isn't bad either.I could just imagine this being a perfect vehicle for an actor like Steve McQueen in his pomp and that was before I learned the film was originally slated for him years before!Costner in my opinion improves on his dire performance in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves (1991) where he played Robin with a Hollywood accent.Look out for annoying character called Sy Spector (Gary Kemp) of brothers Spandau Ballet fame and also The Krays (1990).Also look out for another interesting casting choice Ralph Waite as Frank's father, Herb Farmer. Older viewers will recognise him from the role of John Walton Sr. On television show The Waltons.The chemistry between Costner and Houston is what makes the movie a success. It looks like they really did enjoy each others company.

58,Beejerman,CHEER! - (9 stars out of 10),9,8 January 2019,"The stage curtains open ...I just finished watching and reviewing the documentary released this year simply titled, ""Whitney"" - so I thought I would revisit ""The Bodyguard"" since it has literally been years since the last time I saw it. Most movies, as they get older, become dated and not as viable as they once were. Not so with this film. In fact, it just seems to get better over time, like a fine, aged wine. Some of the little things that used to get under my skin with this movie (ie: Kevin Costner's hair style, Whitney's choppy debut acting performance, some of the mistakes they made in regard to how a trained secret service agent would really act in certain situations, some of the bad camera work at the end of the movie) - these things just don't bother me anymore.The power and the strength of this film is the music, the chemistry between Costner and Houston, and the strong characters. Of course, maybe it is just the age I'm at now that makes the difference. It has been over 25 years since it came out and the first time I saw it. Maybe, the movie has always been this good and I'm just now starting to realize it. In any case, it has grown to be a personal favorite of mine. I won't bore you with a synopsis of the plot, since this one is so well known already. But, I will say that with the passing of Whitney Houston, this one can be a bitter pill to take now. I did feel my heartstrings being pulled a bit more and the sadness creep in. Despite this, however, I still love this movie.

You get a little peek into the private life that you might not see otherwise.At times the film feels lurid and soapy. But other times it is fascinating. Kevin Costner did a very good job here and looks so handsome. He really gave his character life here. Whitney Houston also does a good job and it wasn't any stretch at all to believe her portrayal of the big star singer.

Houston is, of course, gorgeous and sings like an angel, but her acting ""talent"" is nowhere to be seen, and her ineptness brings down the whole movie--not that it had a lot going for it in the first place. After Houston, playing a pop diva, starts getting death threats from an obsessed and obviously crazed fan, Costner--a former Secret Service agent--is hired to protect her. Instead of showing appreciation for his efforts to save the lives of her and her family, however, Houston proceeds to fight him at every turn, insulting him, mocking his attempts to turn her house into a secure area and generally making a complete ass of herself, and her attitude spreads to her entourage and hangers-on, all of whom turn on Costner. In the real world Costner's character would have told her to screw off after the first day and dumped her, but--in a plot ""twist"" you can see coming a mile away--they proceed to fall in love. Yeah, right.Anyway, like I said, Houston is great to look at, her voice is divine, and Costner tries hard, but overall this movie is not much more than an extended episode of ""General Hospital"" or some other equally brainless soap opera, and is just as predictable and badly acted.

We have here is a few suspense moments and a melodrama of the romantic link between these two characters. The movie does have an interesting twist at the end and the overall acting isn't bad in the movie. What the movie lacks is cliched dialogue and the chemistry between the two leads feels forced and cartonny - like are you serious with the samurai sword scene?? If you are a 80's and 90's pop fan, then you will love the soundtrack in this movie. The movie could have gone more in the stalker suspense but instead gave away the reveal plus there was an interesting aspect of the expectations of fans with their idols. We could of also seen Frank's obsession with security and changed the script around his reasons on becoming a security guard however once again we were given a bland backstory. I did enjoy Costner's performance as a cold and detached guy however hides his emotions under the surface around guilt of a prior presidential assassination attempt.

66,axlrhodes,An easy target for critics.,7,23 March 2018,"The willingness to sacrifice oneself to save the life of another person is inherently romantic, which is the idea at the centre of The Bodyguard, a two-worlds-collide drama-thriller starring two of the hottest tickets of 1992's film and music scene, Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston. While it might make an easy target for critics, The Bodyguard is a film that connected well with audiences upon release. Much of that comes down to the perfect storm of three elements; Lawrence Kasdan's script (it rattled around Hollywood for years), Kevin Costner's leading man status and Whitney Houston's incredible vocal performance - particularly the mighty power-ballad 'I Will Always Love You', which ate up the pop charts. These three elements are competently stitched together by British director, Mick Jackson, who captures enough chemistry between the leads to paper over the gaping cracks that emerge. Costner carries his brand of quiet man chivalry, which gives Houston room to find her character in their scenes, which are always engaging. You can only guess, but it doesn't seem a stretch to imagine the similarities between her character and what her life was like. The writing tries to examine what it's like to live in the cocoon of celebrity, but the direction of the narrative becomes increasingly about the thriller aspect of the story, leaving some, but not much to chew over. When the finale comes, it's a messy combination of awkward positioning and bad logistics, culminating in a predictable, mostly underwhelming conclusion.

Houston does well in her role as a temperamental diva, is talented, pretty, bitchy and vulnerable. She fares much better than star Kevin Costner, who plays the title role.

70,imbluzclooby,A successful and bad movie!,5,14 December 2005,"Why was the ""Bodyguard"" so successful at the box office? I know the reasons. Does it mean that it's a good movie? That all depends on who you ask. The Bodyguard is a story that only appeals to one's emotions and never intellect or depth. This movie has a very weak script. The plot is just elongated with the spirit of your typical love story formula. And it touches on all the essential romantic buttons to have girls flocking to the theater. No it will never be heralded as a masterpiece and it even lacks the depth of movies like, ""Love Story"" and ""The way we were"". First off, the pairing of Houston and Costner was unique and somehow drew you in. Houston plays herself pretty much; the spoiled, talented and exceptionally beautiful pop star. Costner plays the dry, uptight and boorish professional bodyguard. They are both opposites, but that is what makes the love story intriguing. Costner has been bashed for his boringness, dullness and lack of charisma. He never really qualified as a leading man in my opinion. But here it somehow works, because Houston's beauty was more revealing as a foil to his bland as goat milk persona. And Whitney Houston was at the height of her career and beauty in 1992, and Costner was at his prime as well. Intellectuals and film critics are more likely to be annoyed by this sappy and overblown love tale. But there are those that just can't help but be immersed in the romance intrigue of it. This is your rare and typical successful bad movie that ranks up there in the same phenomenon as ""Rambo"", ""Terminator 2"", etc. Brainless films that just appeal to our senses and emotions.",The Bodyguard

What's odd is that Whiteney Houston, who is not an experienced actress, gives a more believable performance than veteran actor Kevin Costner. Costner has done well in other movies but was wooden here. He's trying to do a Steve McQueen cooler-than-cool turn, but he seems like a wind-up toy soldier. Also worthy of censure is Costner's haircut, which was rightly criticized at the time. Houston is convincing enough, but it's because she's essentially playing herself. They have a love scene, which was also OK but nothing memorable. There is the supporting cast, which is good enough but nothing memorable. The screenplay is occasionally exciting but usually routine and not always believable. Costner's character probably wouldn't have been in the secret service to begin with if he's traumatized by a shooting that took place when he was off duty at a funeral. The soundtrack is the real star and this film features some great songs. Also praiseworthy is the ending, which was one of the few parts to avoid romantic clichés. It's very easy watching and will appeal to fervent fans of Whiteney Houston and romantic drama.",The Bodyguard
72,gws-2,A Less That Mediocre Thriller,5,2 March 2002,"Usually one can count on high production values to make even a bad Kevin Costner movie interesting.  Alas, despite having high production values, ""The Bodyguard"" was a bore.  Let me count the ways:  slow plot, preposterous story, and bad acting -- particularly by Whitney Houston.  In fairness, I should say that the completely unbelievable conduct of Houston's character does serve to make her performance seem even worse than it was.  Costner does not a bad faux Steve McQueen as the existential and dour (depressed?) athletic pretty boy, Frank Farmer.  But his performance does not save the film.  Indeed, I doubt that De Niro could have saved it.  Spend two hours and ten minutes elsewhere; not recommended; 5 out of 10.",The Bodyguard
73,el7,Romantic thriller to watch on the couch.,7,15 February 2021,"This story of a bodyguard tasked with keeping a pop diva safe from an obsessed stalker has some definite flavors of cheese, but it's elevated by the performances of its two leads. Kevin Costner could have played the bodyguard character as just a remote badass with supernaturally good instincts, but he layered some emotional complexity into his portrayal of Frank. Whitney Houston gave her character Rachel vulnerability, strength of will and sheer star power. Together, they give us this great 'ships passing closely in the night' romance, kind of like Casablanca meets the Lifetime movie of the week.The story starts by introducing us to Frank, a former Secret Service agent turned elite bodyguard, but he won't sign a long term contract. At first he lets the viewer believe it's because he's afraid he'd get too complacent and comfortable and lose his edge; but as the story progresses it becomes more obvious that he's afraid he'll become emotionally attached and lose his objectivity, which would cause him to start making mistakes, and indeed that nearly does happen. The backstory behind why he feels this way and left the Secret Services does not serve this character development at all, which is just one of the ways the story gets a little melodramatic. However, it's still incredibly enjoyable to watch.Anyway, one of his rules is that he doesn't guard celebrities. This is because they come with entourages who demand access which he wants to restrict, and that proves to be the case with Rachel Marron, a singer/actress who has been receiving threatening letters which have escalated to the point where her chauffeur nearly loses a hand from a booby-trapped gift. Frank reluctantly takes on the job, and then discovers that the threat is not as straightforward as it first appeared. Rachel's manager has not advised her of exactly how much danger she's in, afraid that it will result in her cancelling appearances, and also whoever it is might have insider access to her.Frank lays down the law for how he thinks Rachel should be guarded. Rachel is not thrilled with her movements being curtailed. Sparks fly. Drama happens. Things get heated. Some of the scenes are downright silly, but the leads have enough chemistry to overcome it. The threat actually turns out to be three-fold, which I won't spoil for anyone who hasn't already heard about the plot twist. It's a pretty good one. It results in a consequence that gets glossed over awfully fast, though.Overall, the movie is great if you enjoy a thriller with a good love story and don't mind if the couple's status is ambiguous at the end. If you're wondering whether that scene in the poster actually happens in the movie: yes it does.",The Bodyguard

I did read that Kevin Costner's part was originally written for Steve McQueen, and he may've been able to pull it off. Note that K.C. has Steve's haircut.

Hollywood couldn't find away to make truly good movies in the 1990's, and many times through together movies like this, roped some big time actors into doing in in order to get people in the theaters, only to see the flicks quickly disappear when the audiences quit showing up. What we have in a contrived, rather implausible little story that never gets the viewer interested, and can't even get the viewer to care about their respective fates. Whitney Houston, providing scant actor ability, has zero chemistry with Kevin Costner, who should be more happy to include Waterwold, or the 1970's drive in flick Sizzle Beach USA on his resume then this fluff. Shoddy direction, implausible ending, and more or less, a script that seems like it was written on the fly. I remember being so bored out of my mind, that I was actually reading the box my popcorn came in. Even the girl was completely bored. We left as the movie was ending, as did the friends we came with. We all agreed that we could have spent the money better by tossing it in the toilet, and flushing.

80,daviddaphneredding,one of those touching films adhesive to the mind,10,5 August 2013,"In this Mick Jackson-directed film from Warner Brothers, which was produced by Lawrence Kasden, Jim Wilson, and one of the two main stars...Kevin Costner..., the issue of interracial relationships is addressed; while that is a matter now tolerated but not totally accepted, even though it is much more frequent than it used to be, this movie presents it as a situation which can be warm, so much so that the sometimes-negative attitude toward it does not ""stick out like a sore thumb"", to employ a favorite cliché. Kevin Costner is in one of his best roles as the secret service agent, Frank Farmer, who is hired to protect Rachel Marron (played by Whitney Houston in her movie-acting debut), but neither has any idea that there will be love between them. In the movie Farmer does not beg Rachel Marron to be protected by him when the independent Marron is often hostile toward him, but that changes and then, again, love develops between them. Bill Cobbs and Ralph Waite do well in their supporting roles. The color is beautiful, so much so that the northern part of this country, with its snow-capped mountains is, in turn, beautiful and refreshing, and the ocean bordering Miami Beach is drawing and refreshing. There is plenty of exciting action, a bit of mystery, and, obviously, warm romance. Whitney Houston is her beautiful self as she portrays her consummate singing ability through such songs as ""If I Don't Have You"", as well as a signature song ""I Will Always Love You"". Because of all its trappings, the movie is one that could never be easily forgotten.",The Bodyguard
81,RJBrez,"Classic Costner, prime Whitney, not perfect but entertaining",7,15 March 2021,"I recently had the chance to watch The Bodyguard for the first time in years. Now that I'm older, I actually appreciated the storytelling much more than I did when I was younger. I love this era. No internet, or social media, or selfies, or any of that b.s. Obviously it has some flaws but I'd rather focus on the positives.Costner. I've come to appreciate KC's work much more the last few years. I think this role was perfect for him. His demeanor/actions always seem believable. My favorite scene is when Rachel's other bodyguard tries to fight him in the kitchen. No words are spoken during the fight as Costner makes a fool out of the man, and at the very end he simply says "" Now I don't want to talk about this again"". Pure gold.-Whitney. This movie really makes me sad for how WH's life went downhill after this movie. She was a star. Beautiful and talented. Her acting is far outmatched by Costner, but that happens to most people in the same position. I thought she was great.The soundtrack. This is obviously what most people remember and they should. It's simply incredible, and to this date, is still the bestselling soundtrack of all time. I'll leave it at that.I won't spoil the big reveal on here, but I do think it is what made some people dislike the movie. I loved the ending however with both of them going their separate ways after his job was done. You get the beautiful voice of Whitney and you get to see Costner in his new role, fade to black. Perfect, simple, storytelling. If this was made in 2021 it would have to end with the hopes of a sequel or a combined universe. Or it simply wouldn't be made. So if you do get a chance to watch it, please do. And enjoy it, you don't get to watch this type of movie that much anymore.",The Bodyguard
82,teejayniles2345,Why it's nowhere near CASABLANCA,9,5 July 2002,"This fairly well-constructed movie/music collage is rather dated as my wife and I watched it again July 2002.  The 10-year gap wherein some of the plot deficiencies would be unbelievable nowadays makes this seem ""long ago in a legendary land.""  The ""Mine"" club scene especially seems like a 1930's kind of gag since passing a grown woman in a kind of ""mosh"" setting would never really happen with such a harmless, happy ending.  Being stranded at the remote family hideaway with no lines of communication or emergency back-up plan also seems pre-World War II. To enjoy this movie one must enjoy the pop sound of Ms. Houston as well as tolerate the country (light) music of ""I will always love you.""  It is admittedly wacky when it dissects the Oscar/Academy Awards facade; after all, nobody ever really muffs their lines when the television audience is 2 billion viewers, really (??). This movie should never get serious consideration for telling its viewers that much about ""LOVE"" as does a much better but still ""dated"" movie: Casablanca (director Michael Kurtiz).  I believe that BODYGUARD is alluding to it in its choice for an airport penultimate scene; neither principle actor in the 1992 casting approaches the sensuality and romantic extremes of Bergman and Bogart.  Who is the ""third"" side of the LOVE Triangle in this subtextual riff?  Probably the Bodyguard's own sublimated Father-figure aspect with the Diva's son.  That kid is left adrift in more ways than one in the course of the movie -- whether he can swim and just what the ""name"" of the Diva's nominated movie is seem to be not very solid at different points of the screenplay.  For its strengths of music and comedy (sometimes inadvertent), I give it an ""8"" out of 10 star rating.",The Bodyguard
83,annmason1,Flat Champagne,5,20 January 2011,"The problem with this film is the total lack of chemistry between the two lead characters; or rather, between the actors who play them. That attraction is supposed to fuel the movie and drive it forward, but it's water in the gas tank; this clunker only rolls a few feet.Whitney Houston is so talented and beautiful, but exudes no sex appeal. In that respect she is like Julie Andrews of old; very talented, lovely, but, as one critic wrote of Andrews, ""Has all the sex appeal of a very efficient dietitian."" I would rather have seen, oh...Halle Berry or some actress with real dynamism (and dubbed voice) getting mixed up with Kevin Costner.Kevin Costner is a fine actor who was absolutely doing his best Steve McQueen impression. Women love to see a powerful, internally sensual man succumb to a woman so sensual or otherwise desirable that the poor guy's helpless. Costner is a powerful actor and few female actresses have that presence...Angelina Joli? Costner even was too powerful for Susan Sarandan in Bull Durham. I agree that, second to the flat interaction of the main characters, the story made little sense. If Frank Farmer had such a fragile ego that he could not come to terms with a tragic event he had nothing to do with, he would not have been selected by the Secret Service in the first place.And what was the plan with taking the entourage to the lake? Were they going to live there indefinitely? Papa Walton, by the way, was miscast as Frank's father. He seemed to be ready to break into a smile at any moment; or perhaps the corners of his mouth got caught on his dentures.The sister and son were very good. I liked the acting ability of both; Fletcher was very subtle and sensitive in a film that wasn't.The Oscar scenes were funny. Anyone who saw Naked Gun 33 1/3 keeps expecting Mary Lou Retton to come flipping and bouncing down the aisle. Rachel's (joking) reason for risking her life in attending was ludicrous...you gotta cheer when Frank's stoic chastity appropriately caved; if she was a Darwin award candidate, her days were numbered anyway, so why not? Actually, I thought Whitney Houston's acting was fine; she downplayed the role, seemed rather shy, and perhaps if there were more chemistry with the male lead, she would have received less criticism. I would like to have seen Diana Ross and Steve McQueen; they were equally matched dynamic folks.Oh well, there are worse movies. Just because this one lacked chemistry, motivation, and sense, doesn't make it half as bad as the remake of Lost Horizon...my overall standard of rotten films.And hey, I thought Frank's haircut was sexy.",The Bodyguard

85,kira02bit,A real bore,1,16 September 2019,"Critically ravaged action/mystery/romance has a cult following among viewers of little discernment, but it is difficult to see why. Stoic bodyguard Kevin Costner is hired to overhaul the security for pop star/actress Whitney Houston in light of some death threats. Naturally the two clash and then fall in love. Yawn.The clunky screenplay had been growing mold around Hollywood since the days of Steve McQueen, who was the first star sought for the title role. Costner is oddly made up to resemble McQueen here. Costner's bodyguard, who is described as the best in the business, holds himself personally responsible as he was assigned to Reagan's detail but had a day off when the attempted assassination by Hinckley occurred. Thus ends the character development.Naturally, since Houston is being threatened and Costner is there to make sure she remains out of harm's way, she will be cooperative...NOT. Truly there would be no movie if Houston's character reacted in any credible manner to anything that goes on around her. She talks tough to Costner in a few scenes and tries to order people around, but she reveals herself to be such a clueless ninny that she cannot even finesse an overly exuberant crowd during one of her concert shows - and she has purportedly been in the business for quite some time. In short, she exists solely to place herself in some form of conspired danger at every opportunity and then wilt.Truthfully, the film is unsuccessful at whatever it tries its hand at. The mystery elements are half-hearted and even snoozing viewers will pinpoint the person behind the threats. Then again, Houston receives so many threats throughout the film - from audiences, from nuts, from people close to her - that it becomes difficult to keep track of who or what has her in their sights at any given moment.The action scenes are a bust. Everything unfolds in such a plodding manner that even the most obvious and clumsy of scenes are related as though they are of monumental importance and dripping with relevance. Houston never seems to be seriously in any danger, the assassin seems almost foolishly clumsy, and there is zero sense of urgency to anything that unfolds.The romance is deadly. To say that there is a lack of chemistry between Costner and Houston would be an understatement of colossal proportions. I can imagine frozen cadavers generating more heat. Costner is devoid of personality here and every line reading is flat. His pulse never seems to rise above resting. A bit of humor would have helped, but other than a mid-movie quip to an unwanted pass from a female partygoer, Costner remains a glum and uninvolving performer.Houston is every bit his equal on this front. Playing a pop star diva/actress should not be much of a stretch for her, but the woman has no energy or life onscreen. Even her concert moments are lifeless. There is no warmth or excitement to her - even her attempts to be diva-esque are pitifully weak. The conclusion set at the Oscars is unintentionally hilarious because it is impossible to imagine Houston being seriously considered for any acting awards given her emotionless line readings herein. And listening to her relentlessly wail ""I Will Always You Love,"" which quickly became grating after endless plays on the radio is no selling point either.Costner and Houston are singularly bad, but casting them as a couple on which to hang a film their combined effect is a virtual primer on how never to cast a romance. They are the antithesis of chemistry.So we have a romance populated by leads that have no chemistry, an action film with no action and a mystery with no surprises. To say this is a huge failure would be kind. It does not even have a camp element to make it unintentionally fun. In short, it honestly has nothing to recommend it.",The Bodyguard

It was clearly a movie that saw Kevin Costner's film career start to wane through highs and lows where to this day, he makes frequent appearances in second rated films despite some previous film successes like Dances With Wolves or JFK.
I did watch The Bodyguard a couple of years later on the living room box after reading the usually average ratings in the press. The film
turned out to be quite dull for a number of reasons with the plot about a bodyguard assigned to protect a celebrity singer played by one Whitney Houston, fictitious or not! It was even Whitney Houston's first attempts in making movies with Kevin Costner being the minder as he has to deal with Houston's sometimes annoying ""off-stage"" part as if she cared less about her own safety from a mob of deranged fans and behaves like a spoilt child that can sometimes become a cause for discomfort.

However because Frank is hired to be her bodyguard, the lines get blurred as Rachel wants more. The music in the film in my opinion play a big role.

Both the bodyguard and the hitman are possibly some of the worst professionals in their field in the movie.One of the main character's sister hires an ex-bodyguard to kill her sister.
The guy then rigs a boat to explode, not knowing at all who's going to be on the boat, thus giving away his presence to his target while they're hiding away. He then kills the sister for reasons unexplained and escapes. At this point he could easily have walked away with the money as he's already been paid, and nobody would ever have come looking for him and he could have lived a happy life without carrying out the murder on his target.
But instead he sneaks into the oscars, reveals himself to the target's bodyguard (who in turn cops that he is actually the hitman after his client), and then proceeds to try kill her in front of everyone on purpose to create a scene in front of a large audience, with a laser pointing right at her head and with clearly no escape plan. It was like he wanted to get caught or shot and didn't care about escaping or keeping the money he would earn. If the whole point of this was personal, the movie never explains the motivation behind it at all.Now the bodyguard.... firstly he sleeps with his client and then tells her he can't protect her if he's in a relationship with her. He allows her sister to be murdered (at which stage you would assume the main character would either have fired him or hired more bodyguards knowing her life was in serious danger) and then goes back to sleeping with the client even though he had already said he cannot properly protect her if he is doing so.Also the scene where the bodyguard jumps into the boat and pushes the client's son out of the boat, nearly drowning him is one of the most comical and stupid scenes in the film, with no explanation given at all as to why he felt it was necessary to push the kid into the water knowing he can't swim.The only reason this movie gets so much attention is because it has a great soundtrack, but that's the only thing this movie has going for it.",The Bodyguard

It's not the kind of song that needs to be belted out at full volume. Second, I don't think she is all that beautiful either with those lifeless eyes of hers and the bitchiness came way too easy for her.Kevin Costner looks good in clothes (costumes) but has the voice of a 15 year old boy. I've never liked any of his movies or his attempts at acting.Put these 2 together and voilà, an awful, awful mess. Was the interracial love affair supposed to be daring in the 90s?

99,john_meyer,"Without good writing, good acting means nothing",2,25 February 2008,"TCM was showing this as part of their ""Oscar"" month. I ended up staying up late to watch it.Wow, what a waste of time! The problem isn't KC or WH or their chemistry (or lack thereof), but the idiotic plot that just doesn't make any sense. I could fill pages with examples, but the one that made me really sorry that I had sacrificed my beauty sleep to watch this was when Costner's character dives into a freezing lake to knock a kid out of a boat, but for no apparent reason other than he just figure out that the bad guy is nearby. After safely out of the water, the boat stops in the middle of the lake and blows up. Since neither Costner or Houston's characters had been in the boat or shown any interest in the boat, the whole idea that someone would try to kill them by blowing it up made absolutely no sense at all.And what about the ridiculous attempt at romance, which is obviously the whole point of the film? There is not one credible scene that explains either character's attraction for the other. None. So, the reason for no chemistry between the two is that the idiot who wrote this didn't provide any dialog or staging to provide them with any motivation.So, my advice is to buy a Whitney Houston album so you can hear her fabulous voice without interference from all the foley noise, and then rent ""No Way Out,"" which provides all sorts of motivation for the romance and sex scenes with an equally serious, but far more plausible performance from Costner.",The Bodyguard

The first time I ever saw this movie I had watched a movie before hand that also contained the actor Bill Cobbs.  I was like Geez.  Anyways, this was a great effort by Kevin Costner, but the chemistry he had with his leading lady didn't seem to be that great.  Well, we can say they did try.  I liked this movie but I wasn't impressed with the chemistry.    To say the least that's why this review isn't that great either!",The Bodyguard

104,gg2507,Many flaws but worth it for Whitney,6,4 October 2021,"This movie has a very weak script and a serious problem with the tone: it doesn't transit well between romance, thriller and drama, but it tries hard to be all that. Also, the male lead is just shallow (?) or simply lacking charisma. Impossible to see why the sisters would fall for him tbh.Still, it has iconic Whitney songs and even though it's her big screen debut, her acting is solid. Rachel was the only character I could care about in the whole movie. She shined in the role and was funny, charming and multi-dimensional.Overall, ""The Bodyguard"" is too long, too boring and too flawed, but one could still watch it at least once to appreciate Whitney!",The Bodyguard

106,JAW,Great soundtrack,4,30 October 1998,"First of all, let me say that the music in The Bodyguard is awesome. Whitney Houston definitely proves she can sing! Unfortunately, the same can't be said about her acting ability. She stinks, and so does Kevin Costner (as well as his two-dollar haircut). The plot and storyline are all pretty standard.

She couldn't really fail either as she has to play a big star. The movie itself is okay. The highlight is of course the soundtrack which is also the best selling soundtrack of all time and one of the best selling albums of all time. Whitney's voice was a treasure and she could sing it all which is showcased a few times in this movie.

A decade on, and my hatred for this puerile stinker remains unabated.Think of your very worst celluloid nightmare. Multiply it by a hundred and you are only a fraction of the way to realising what an artistic shambles this film really is. Even ""The Swarm"" had some redeeming features.All the depressingly familiar ingredients are here: wooden acting, stilted dialogue and warbly singing. It's overlong, overrated and features one of the most irritating soundtracks in the history of American cinema, which makes me want to stick pins into a wax work effigy of Dolly Parton every time I hear it.Mow the lawn, bath the dog, watch paint dry. I implore you do anything but watch this film.How the respected British Director, Mick Jackson, became involved with this outrage is anyone's guess. Back in 1984, he brought us one of the most disturbing and innovative films ever shown on British TV called ""Threads"". Perhaps he should attempt to combine the two films together.

113,kystilla,I have nothing... do you?,8,14 November 2004,"The movie ""The Bodyguard"" is of a singer, Rachel Marron (Whitney Houston), who is been followed by an obsessed fan. Her new bodyguard is an expert, Frank Farmer (Kevin Costner), who is flawless and does everything to protect Rachel. So, it was a short plot in my words. The movie was actually pretty good, romantic and entertaining, though there was a little too little of drama and thriller. Kevin Costner probably did his best role as nowadays it is hard to even remember that there once was an actor by his name. Whitney Houston is a define B-class star, she should stay with singing.The songs were the ones that saved the movie and made me almost but not quite love it. ""Queen Of The Night"" and ""I Have Nothing"" made me shiver and search the Internet for mp3-s. I'm really sorry that Whitney has gone from a great singer to a drug addict. Sorry, but that is the pure truth. So, to put this all together in a few words, I would say: sweet, entertaining, full of fantastic songs. 8/10 points from me.",The Bodyguard

The acting was good, and Houston did a very good job unlike what others say, but the script was lame and predictable! And the worst part was definitely the inexistant chemistry between Kevin Costner (the bodyguard) and Whitney Houston. This was supposed to be a romantic movie, but there were barely any romantic gestures and to end the movie on such a unromantic-banal conclusion ?! I was very disappointed. The direction was awful and I think Breakfast at Tiffany (1960 movie) was better directed then this. I could clearly see the green-screen in the back during the scene where Frank was being shot at the cottage.

Whitney and Kevin were at the height of their careers when they made this movie, and it shows. He's got the gun, the moves, the Samurai sword. She's got the voice, the attitude and the need. It all works perfectly. Hey - it's a story! You want realism open your local paper. And be bored.

I've read some of the negative reviews and I have to disagree with most of them. This is a pretty entertaining film all around, with a love story for those into that sort of thing but enough elements of a thriller to not put off the males in the audience. Personally, I think they blended the two genres together pretty well here.Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston did fine in their respective roles and the film had a nice pace throughout.I also have to commend this film for some pretty tense scenes that I don't think the other reviews gave enough credit for. The scene at the Oscars was pretty good stuff. The mystery of the stalker kept the momentum going, and the letters and phone calls were genuinely creepy.This may not be a bona fide classic, but it's certainly a very entertaining early '90s romance/thriller with some good songs thrown in as well.I can't imagine what disappointed the others. Maybe they should remove something from their behind area before watching a movie.",The Bodyguard
117,othershinhadi,There's something special about this movie,7,10 November 2021,"If I read the script I probably would've rated this movie a 4 or a 5 based on my imagination on how the movie would go. But the way they executed it made it so much better than it has business being.I think it's Houston and Costner's performance. They don't overdo it like most romance stories do. So I was fooled into believing that the story would match their performances. ""It can't be corny. They play it straight."" Yet it was.And what stuck to my mind most wasn't how corny the story was, but that the romance was pretty good. That's how good they made a movie with a 5/10 corny script. Still a 7 cos I can't defend an 8 with this story, but they really made the most out of it.It also reminds me of a time when movies were really made for theaters and was some sort of a spectacle. Just like in amusement parks you know what's coming but still enjoy the ride, I could see some moments in the film coming with how predictable it was yet still enjoy it.

119,charlotte-yonge,I didn't like it that much the first time around...,9,7 February 2011,"but oh! it was magic to see it again after all these years. Probably the most awkward time to do so, alone, in the middle of the night, when most IMDb reviews suggested to watch it with your ""sweetheart"", i rebelled, thinking I can handle the oozing cheese coming out of the film from all sides.Honestly though, for a Hollywood flick, it's a classic. I know there's a love/hate thing going on with The Bodyguard, but it should be all love, if not for anything else, the two leading stars Kevin Costner (at the prime of his career) & Whitney Houston (at the prime and beauty of hers). You don't see a lot of chemistry these days like the one these two had, they must of known they were meant for their parts because they were played so well under the circumstances. It's *hard* to make a decent movie when it's partly a musical. You have action + suspense + romance + and epic soundtrack rolled into one, you think people would be happy? But no. It's either Whitney's acting is horrid, or Kevin is too short. Well maybe he is, but I still enjoyed their performances nonetheless.What I also liked about this movie was its heart. There were the lovable other body guards, the cute kid, the envious sister, and intimacy like you've never seen! Call me immature, but by the end I was gushing (not crying) simply gushing over their last passionate kiss goodbye. This film was made to be remembered, a sort of time warp back to the 1990s, when there weren't cell phones, but soundtracks about real love, and a lot of spandex (as you will see in numerous outfits throughout the movie.) In a nutshell, I loved it. Fully recommend it, because we all get those late night cravings for ultimate cheese, and this wasn't so much as cheese as it was heart-warming, butterflies in your stomach, at least that's the feeling I got. Open up your mind & heart (corny, yes) to The Bodyguard... and no I will not stoop down to add to the pre-crack Whitney jokes. Goodnight folks.",The Bodyguard

As written in some of the previous reviews I saw about there being no chemistry between Kevin/Whitney? I notice it, but it's not throughout the entire movie... I saw chemistry on/off.In conclusion, it was a great little movie, even my guy enjoys watches it, he sure isn't one for soft movies, but when a movie is great, its that! thumbs up to the late Whitney. a special thumbs up to the sexy Kevin Costner!",The Bodyguard

Thank the Lord for artists who truly put an effort for sharing music, and films such as ""I Will Always Love You."" These artists, down to earth did share togetherness for this work of art, from the deepest heart. One of my favorite scenes, unfortunately Fletcher was in danger in the lake, Frank Farmer, played by Kevin Costner without any hesitation at all ran as fast as he could to rescue Fletcher. The true concern in real life they show for each other and Children which GOD sends into the world for our love and care is one of the main true human family justly due diligence with every fiber of being;- is what endears me to artists.Personally, I always associate ""Jesus Loves The Little Children,"" Red & Yellow & Black & White, as we are concerned to help one another with content of character;-
with, ""Yes, Jesus Loves Me, For The Bible Tells me so.""
~
This iconic film, helped alleviate the stereotype of artists as ""Rachel,"" in some scenes showing the production of concerts and such could lead some to think of them as 'bigger than life,'
as opposed to down to earth regular folk, just like the rest of us. The following relates to one of the serious issues concerning the fostering by some in the media of painting artists to be on some huge pedestal, instead of the pursuit of excellence in respecting the beautiful work they do, the GOD granted dignity of the artists and public figures,
since each of us as the song, ""The Greatest Love Of All,"" tells us, it's the children's laughter that reminds us of how we used to be, child-like simplicity of down to earth folk,
with respecting one another's human dignity, and personal space.~
(*note: besides the incident that follows, here is link to a short video of David Brenner
and a child actor at the time Drew Barrymore, who was bum rushed, deeply frightened,
chased 28 blocks, the chaperone took her into an establishment, and the crowd was still there when they went to leave. We each know impartially, no one should have their safety or personal space treated with such disrespect for another human being. In the rare occasions of an artist or public figure addressing me on the job or otherwise, it was cool and all,
but thank GOD for the blessing of just seeing these folk as just human beings persons who happen to be by their GOD given gifts and talents in the public eye. Link omitted.)
In my line of work, now retired, I had a State Police Security Officer Re-Certification Act, license, which required mandatory testing on subjects such as homeland security, public safety crowd dynamics (i.e. When exiting a venue, without some safeguards, with a bottleneck stairway, one misstep could easily cause trampling by guests on top of guests); keeping an diligent eye open for any suspicious packages or activity. Some venues have, away from the public view trained first responders who are prepared for any coyote terrorist or rioting civil unrest event.~
The latter happened at one venue, with such sad violence that the whole stadium was on lockdown until the state police and security, and other responders could aid a peaceful climate. Sadly arrests were made on those responsible for extreme violence. Some venues we have to lock arms to form a line of defense so an on rushing crowd cannot get onto the stage with performers and equipment still on stage. In one even a previous occurrence a guest former obstinate regarding, along with other the fire marshal's public safety rules by jamming a public aisle to take pictures,;- got in my face threatening to hit me. So, when we locked arms, the usual danger of being punched in the face, vulnerable with arms locked was higher.~

It's a great drama--romance, mystery, with a spice of humor thrown in here and there, enough to make you smile and lighten up the mood but not enough to make it seem tawdry. Kevin Costner's performance makes the whole thing for me: he spins a great character without becoming bland or stony. Whitney Houston is fairly good as an actress, smiling and charming in her pleasanter days, and obviously her songs are very good--I hope no one will contest that she has an excellent voice (or did; does she even sing anymore?). Watching the little boy, Fletcher (sorry I don't know his real name), was also a treat. He's the precocious-almost-to-a-fault genre, but it was fun seeing all his antics and especially hearing the things he said.I think this movie has gotten a much lower rating than it deserves.

I guess the people of our generation have been no longer sensitive to prophecy like this, as depicted by this beautiful piece in the then-modern context.",The Bodyguard
146,cbrennen,Can't help it Costner is sexy,10,7 February 2005,"Okay, I gave it a 10. I just can't help it. Costner is sexy as the reticent bodyguard and Whitney Houston was at her most beautiful. I'll even admit to having loved the soundtrack when it came out. I think the plot surprises, too - though that could be my relative innocence. My recollection is that the movie was critically panned. But it kept me up all night on late-night TV tonight - because I had to see the ending just one more time. I think my 9 year-old will love it, and I'm ordering it on Netflix. If you're looking for something intelligent, forget it. I also think you need to be female to see any merit in this movie at all, because it really is about Costner's appeal - to Whitney and to those of us up too late at night. He's not Benicio Del Toro (there's only one of those) but he's definitely well-cast for The Bodyguard. Watch it with a girlfriend.",The Bodyguard

Proper movie making ensuring the build up is where it should be each time! If this doesn't resonate with your significant other than I don't know what will!🤞,The Bodyguard
148,xenaevegabby,Excellent Chemistry between Houston and Costner,10,11 May 2007,"I don't care if people say it's a chick flick. I don't see it that way. I think this movie was a great start for Houston's acting career. The character of Rachel Marron was complex, and her personality clashing with Fram Farmer's set the tone for this movie.I quite enjoyed the soundtrack as well. The music as well as Rachel's performances at various stages of the plot fit perfectly with the mood. The ""Queen of the Night"" performance was out of control, as was the situation at that point in the movie.What can I say about the end? A perfect ending for a chick like me, I suppose. On a more serious note, I liked how the movie wasn't perfectly happy and warm at the end. It was obvious that these two could not be together at this point in their lives, because they got in each other's way. But, that does not rule out the possibility of them finding one another again later on down the line.",The Bodyguard
149,laura_lsd,This is a torture,3,13 July 2020,"I saw the movie back in 92 and I thought it was offensively bad, really really bad. 28 years later I watched it again thinking that maybe I hated it so much because of my date back then, whom I didn't like (I can't remember why I agreed to go out with him). Nop, I hated the movie because it's really really bad; everything is bad. Kevin Costner should be ashamed of doing this.",The Bodyguard
150,skjellgren,Very romantic,9,28 February 2020,"Love this movie. I ""will always love"" it. Both makes a wonderful performance. I have seen it a numerous amount of times and its growing on me each time. This is high class performance!",The Bodyguard
151,G_Peroda,Love and Life mixed into an obsessive bodyguard's way of working causes chaos,10,23 June 2006,"I am a personal fan of Whitney Houston, and I believe she didn't cause any dishonor to her flawless reputation. Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston truly portrayed the couple of the year. What I like about this movie is its simplicity, honesty and magnificent music. I don't know why the Razzie Awards attacked the film so much, it's a truly classical love story with great performance, music and directing. Although the roll was originally for Diana Ross, I can't imagine Rachel Maron being interpreted as any other woman but Whitney Houston. If you haven't watched it, I honestly think you should, because this is a mist-see cinematographic treasure that is rare to find in today's modern chaos. It has no special effects or any computer tricks, it is as simple as it gets, and I believe that that's the secret to a great film. The outline of this movie is Frank Farmer (Costner) being an extremely serious bodyguard protecting Rachel Marron (Houston), an extremely immature person. The different points of view of both affect Farmer's way of working, causing chaos during the process of Rachel's protection.",The Bodyguard
152,brodan,One of the worst films of all time.,1,9 May 1999,"This film is surprisingly bad.  All the acting was bad, including the child. The only redeeming quality is the music.  I find it hard to believe that they would even consider making a sequel to this nightmare.",The Bodyguard
153,Blackhawk-3,A classic film!,10,13 August 2000,"This is one of the best films that i have ever watched. it has a very strong storyline, with scenes of action and plenty of drama throughout. A film that had such a wide variety of genre, action, drama, thriller, romance. although there is romantic reference, there is not too much of it, and only refers to it I feel to strengthen the plot itself. A must-see film!",The Bodyguard

155,kierangane,Great movie,9,31 January 2009,"Has everything. Whitney acts better than Costner, but great story and well made.Loved the references to Yojimbo.Good country scenes with the father from the Waltons. The characters rang true.The jealousy of Rachel's sister rang true and added another dimension to the movie.And then there is the music. Incredible. Made the best use of Whitney's voice. Most movies age, but in 2009 it still felt contemporary.1 point dropped for Costner's acting. He is wooden in a number of scenes and doesn't seem to choose the best delivery for each line.",The Bodyguard

157,Brynnda,"I liked this movie, but felt bad for Fletcher (the young son) in the end",7,9 May 2019,"Spoilers: I did like this movie a lot, but I did feel bad for Fletcher when Frank and Rachel ended up going their separate ways. I feel like RAchel should have been less selfish and thought more about her young son's needs before getting into an intimate relationship with Frank/Kevin Costner. I'm sure the writers wanted them to get that close to add more drama and maybe some heart ache to the story, but I often think it's a bad idea for a single or divorced mother to get close to a man before considering how the man or the relationship with him might affect her children, especially if they're young and the relationship ends up not working out. Maybe it would have been hard for someone like Rachel, considering the situation (that her life was in danger) and her career to not get too close to/involved intimately with Frank, but I was really sorry to see them chose to go their separate ways just because she was too selfish or maybe too insecure to think ahead to see how the outcome of their being together would ultimately affect her son. I""m sure Fletcher loved his mom, but he deserved better.",The Bodyguard
