0,TheLittleSongbird,"Nice to look at, but marred by a muddled storyline.",7,19 May 2009,"The Golden Compass is lovely to look at, I mean I really liked the costumes and the scenery. The problem is that the plot of the film is a bit muddled. I haven't read the book by Phillip Pullman but I've heard from my brother it's very good. Back to the film, there were some scenes where the action felt rushed, and others got a bit confusing plot wise. I think that director Chris Weitz was trying to cram too much into a 108 minute film, and because of that, the script became increasingly uneven and contrived. Though on a positive note, I really liked the acting. Dakota Blue Richards gave a spirited performance as Lyra, and Nicole Kidman looks beautiful and manipulative as Mrs Coulter. And Ian McKellan did a superb job with the voicing of the polar bear, and the polar bear fight was definitely one of the better scenes of the movie. The only casting problem was that of Daniel Craig, he just seemed out of character. All in all, an enjoyable film, with a 7/10. Bethany Cox.",The Golden Compass
1,bkoganbing,Just Let The Question Develop Within You And The Compass Will Do The Rest,7,8 December 2007,"I wish I could have given The Golden Compass a better review. I loved the special effects and the players are some of the best around today. But I was left hanging more than once during the film. I hate making the comparison, but The Golden Compass was a lot like the two Brady Bunch movies which were developed solely for their fans. If you had not watched the television series and knew some of the classic episodes you would have been completely lost watching either of those films. The Golden Compass is certainly a better property than the Brady Bunch, but I fear unless you read the books which I didn't, you could not have known what was coming. The film is located in an alternate reality where people's souls as it were are located out of their body in the form of animals. The fabric that holds this universe together is dust, something that is found throughout our universe. With animals so closely bound to human kind the question of man being carnivorous is not an issue. I did kind of wonder what they did to feed themselves, maybe we'll get that answer in a sequel. There's a ruling orthodoxy on this planet that brooks no dissent in matters of creation. There's punishment a plenty for even the mildly inquisitive. No one is going to miss the point made here about the dangers of a theocratic state. A young girl, Dakota Blue Richards, appears to be a child foretold in heretic prophecy who's going to bring a new order of things. She has to be stopped, whatever the cost. Put in charge of the stopping is the very elegant Nicole Kidman.In this world it isn't lions who are the King of Beasts as say in Narnia. Here it's the majestic polar bear of the north and serving as the voice of the noble and newly crowned King of the Bears is Sir Ian McKellan, best performance in the film, followed closely by Sam Elliott as the aviator for higher, an older wild west version of Han Solo.I do hope future films do tie up some of the loose ends left in this one.",The Golden Compass
2,Leofwine_draca,Superficially entertaining,6,24 November 2012,"I've had the pleasure of reading Philip Pullman's NORTHERN LIGHTS, the novel from which this film is adapted, so I was interesting to find out how it holds up. My advice to those who've read the book beforehand is to forget all about it: THE GOLDEN COMPASS works as a colourful and superficial children's adventure film, packed with effects and magic, but as an adaptation of the novel it's a travesty.All of the backdrop and Catholic Church-allegory stuff is dropped in favour of CGI effects. The story is hurried over, characters aren't given time to be properly introduced so are just dropped into the mix. As a result, it becomes difficult to take interest in what's playing out on screen, although it admittedly looks good.As seems to be the norm these days, there's an ensemble cast of performers - a lot of them in roles so minor you wonder why they bothered turning up (Christopher Lee and Eva Green in particular) - so some fun to be had from watching them interact. The special effects are also decent for the most part. I imagine children will thoroughly enjoy it, but the truth is they haven't left much in for adults to get out of it...",The Golden Compass
3,SnoopyStyle,Not much fun for non-readers,5,15 September 2013,"This is based on a popular novel. The problem is that it's way too complicated and there is little explaining at the start of the movie. Even Star Wars has those little blurbs at the start of the movie. For the first half of the movie, there is a lot of trying to understand what's going on. And there is a lot to understand. I didn't read the books, and it's a tough slog.In an alternate Earth, people have animal manifestation of their souls (daemon). A young girl Lyra Belacqua (Dakota Blue Richards) lives among scholar. Her uncle Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig) is faced with deadly intrigue. There is something called dust falling in the Arctic expanse of the North in the land of the Icebears. It may lead to other worlds. Kids are going missing under mysterious circumstances. Marisa Coulter (Nicole Kidman) is a mysterious woman that has something to do with the dust. Can Lyra trust her? It just doesn't pick up for far too long. I think we're supposed to be awed by all the different words, and the world just slightly off center. Nicole Kidman is an ice queen, and it puts the movie in a freeze. It's not a world that I find compelling. At least Dakota Blue Richards has some acting skills. But there is just too much history to digest.",The Golden Compass
4,claudio_carvalho,Delightful Fantasy,8,5 July 2008,"In a parallel world ruled by The Magisterium where people's souls have animal shapes, the orphan Lyra Belaqua (Dakota Blue Richards) is educated in the Jordan College, and her uncle and Professor Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig) is her tutor. Lyra accidentally overhears a conversation about a research of Lord Asriel in the North Artic and the existence of a powerful Dust that unites different worlds. When her best friend Roger (Ben Walker) is kidnapped by the evil Gobblers, Lyra promises to rescue him. She is invited to go to the North with the influent Mrs. Coulter (Nicole Kidman) and the Jordan's Vice-Chancellor secretly gives her a magic golden compass capable of revealing the truth. When Lyra finds that Mrs. Coulter is the leader of the Gobblers, she escapes from her house and the runaway girl begins an amazing adventure in a war to save her friend and other missing children with her allied Gyptians, Witches and the strong Armored Bear Iorek Byrnison.""The Golden Compass"" is a delightful fantasy of a world where human souls are not embodied but lives separately in an animal shape. The engaging story has wonderful special effects, nice characters and great villains. I have not read the novel; therefore I found this movie a great entertainment and I was completely satisfied. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""A Bússola de Ouro"" (""The Golden Compass"")",The Golden Compass
5,kosmasp,Maybe we are spoiled or maybe it just isn't good ...,4,6 July 2008,"First of I have to say that, as with the Lord of the Rings, I haven't read the novel(s) to the film here too. So I can't say anything about that or compare anything for that matter. But as with Lord of the Rings (I haven't seen or read for that matter ""Narnia"" yet) that doesn't mean I can't be entertained.Well in this case it seems impossible a task. It does try to entertain, of course, but it never fully does. When you're doing fantasy movies that are aimed more at the younger audiences, it doesn't mean you can't have anything exciting for adults too (see Stardust). But it's not that I don't think it will appeal to adults (to most of them anyway), but that it doesn't even achieve to grab the attention of the younger audience. It's incoherent, the pacing is wrong, the villains seem to change their moods as other change their ... pets (no pun intended). Nicole Kidman seems completely out of place, Mr. ""Bond"" (Daniel C.) has an ""encounter"" with an evil man and doesn't even do anything against him (a deliberate choice to make it more family friendly I guess, the good guys can't be doing revenge stuff or anything like that), just to be topped by some horrible scenes (pun intended), that might be even too gruesome for the target audience. And this inconsistency continues with the story structure ...There are of course a few good things (Sam Elliot, who almost helps this movie into another/better level) and other little things. But overall, this is not really something that I can recommend, especially if you haven't seen Lord of the Rings or even STARDUST (even if it's frenzied) :o)",The Golden Compass
6,lee_eisenberg,Coulter the evil,7,12 May 2008,"Before watching ""The Golden Compass"", I had heard that religious groups had condemned it as ""anti-Christian""; I therefore suspected that I would like it. Watching the movie, I actually didn't detect anything relating directly to religion. As far as I could tell, the movie was about totalitarianism, as the Magisterium takes children away from their parents and puts them in a propaganda school. I've never read any of Philip Pullman's novels (I'd never even heard of him until this movie came out), but if this movie is any indication, then it must be an impressive series.It seems that many people have compared this movie with the Harry Potter series, and people argue over which is better. Certainly both involve mind-blowing stories of children's resistance in a world fraught with treachery and deceit. Each of the Harry Potter books - and subsequent movie versions - got progressively more mature, so that by the end they basically portrayed a fight against fascism. I don't know how it works in Philip Pullman's books (and I'll very likely never get around to reading them, given how long it takes me to get through most books). But if Pullman's books follow the same pattern, then I'll be eager to see how the next movie.If I had any problem with the movie, it was the ending. Sometimes, it works to have an ending like that, as was the case in Francois Truffaut's ""The 400 Blows"" or John Sayles's ""Limbo"". But in this kind of movie, I think that they needed more of an outcome. Just my opinion.As for the characters, I would like to talk about Marisa Coulter (Nicole Kidman). Obviously she's a slimy, vile, straight-laced thug. Most interesting of all is that Pullman gave her that surname years before an equally vile Coulter became famous (I mean Ann Coulter). It was a real surprise to have a character like Lee Scoresby (Sam Elliott) suddenly pop up. Imagine that: everyone is very English, and suddenly there's a Texan! The rest of the characters didn't stick in my mind as much.So anyway, ""The Golden Compass"" is worth seeing. Not a masterpiece, but the idea of a parallel universe intrigues me. Also starring Dakota Blue Richards, Daniel Craig, Christopher Lee, Tom Courtenay (Pasha in ""Dr. Zhivago""), plus the voices of Freddie Highmore, Ian McKellen, Ian McShane (""Deadwood""), Kristin Scott Thomas and Kathy Bates.",The Golden Compass
7,jboothmillard,The Golden Compass,3,1 December 2010,"I saw clips of this film and knew it was going to be a fantasy film borrowing from both Harry Potter and The Chronicles of Narnia, based on a book or not, from director Chris Weitz (American Pie, About a Boy). Basically, in a parallel world where all people live with an animal companion known as ""dæmons"", and ruled by The Magisterium, is orphan Lyra Belaqua (National Movie Award nominated Dakota Blue Richards) who is being educated at Jordan College with her uncle and Professor Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig) is her tutor. She accidentally overhears that Lord Asriel is in the North Arctic, and that there a powerful Dust that unites different worlds. When Lyra's best friend Roger (Ben Walker) is kidnapped by the evil Gobblers, she goes to rescue him, and is invited to go North with Mrs. Coulter (National Movie Award nominated Nicole Kidman), who turns out to be a bitch and leader of the Gobblers. Next the Vice-Chancellor John Faa (Jim Carter) secretly gives her the golden compass which reveals truths about things, and so begins the girl's amazing journey in a war to save her friend and the whole place. She is allied with the Gyptians, Witches, the strong armoured polar bear Iorek Byrnison (Sir Ian McKellen) and Lee Scoresby (Sam Elliott), and there are some battles and fights along the way. Also starring Casino Royale's Eva Green as Serafina Pekkala, Tom Courtenay as Farder Coram, Derek Jacobi as Magisterial Emissary, Freddie Highmore as Pantalaimon, Simon McBurney as Fra Pavel, Clare Higgins as Ma Costa, Jack Shepherd as Master of Jordan College, Ian McShane as Ragnar Sturlusson, Sir Christopher Lee as First High Councilor, Edward De Souza as Second High Councilor, Kristin Scott Thomas as Stelmaria, Kathy Bates as Hester and Magda Szubanski as Mrs. Lonsdale. The cast may have been impressive, and the special effects served their purpose enough, but I don't know why the critics give this film three stars out of five. I didn't understand what was going on, I dozed off somewhere in the middle, and even if I tried to catch up, I almost didn't care because it was so lame, so I just didn't really like it, a slightly boring fantasy adventure. It won the Oscar for Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction, it won the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated the National Movie Award for Best Family Film. Adequate, in my opinion!",The Golden Compass
8,Tweekums,A good first film in a series that sadly wasn't continued,7,25 May 2016,"As the film opens it is explained that there are many parallel universes a in the one where the film is set people's souls dwell in animals, known as daemons, that accompany them everywhere. In this world a group known as the Magisterium wants to keep knowledge from the people that may weaken their authority. In a parallel Oxford a member of the Magisterium attempts to poison scientist Lord Asriel not realising that his niece Lyra, an orphan, is observing his action. She saves her uncle and he proceeds to leave for the far north to research the things that the Magisterium is keenest to keep hidden. Shortly after he leaves the college master gives Lyra a device known as the alethiometer, the golden compass of the title, which reveals the truth to those who can read it. There were once many such devices but this is the last one. Mrs. Coulter offers to take Lyra to her uncle but it is clear that her intentions aren't as pure as she would have Lyra believe. Realising that Mrs Coulter is a threat Lyra escapes and meets aeronaut Lee Scoresby who takes her north. Here she makes an alliance with an icebear and faces many dangers before confronting Mrs. Coulter again.I haven't read the books so can't say how close this adaption is to the original perhaps that is a good thing as it means I'm but put off by any changes. The story is interesting and the film does a good job introducing this parallel world and its differences. I particularly liked the idea of the daemons; these creatures were beautifully rendered so that sometimes I wasn't sure if it was CGI or a real animal. There is plenty of action and a good number of scares although nothing too scary for younger viewers. The cast that features plenty of well-known actors, including Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig, does a fine job although it is the young Dakota Blue Richards who dominates the film; she is rarely off the screen and does a great job as Lyra. The story moves at a good pace all the way to the end and this is where the problem begins; this was clearly meant to be the first film in a series but those sequels were never made so there is no sense of closure as Lyra's quest is clearly far from over it is as though the 'Lord of the Rings' films were cancelled after 'The Fellowship of the Ring'. Overall I'd say this was an enjoyable film; it is just a pity the story wasn't finished.",The Golden Compass
9,wes-connors,Dust in the Wind,5,25 June 2010,"""In a wondrous parallel world where witches soar the skies and Ice Bears rule the frozen North, one special girl is destined to hold the fate of the universe in her hands. When Lyra Belacqua (Dakota Blue Richards) becomes the keeper of the Golden Compass, she discovers that her world - and all those beyond - is threatened by the secret plans of Ms. Coulter (Nicole Kidman). With the help of Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig) and a group of unlikely allies ready to stand at her side, Lyra embarks on an extraordinary quest that celebrates friendship and courage against all odds,"" according to the DVD sleeve summary.Even more wondrous is how so much money could have been spent on a story so cold and unappealing. The big cost, blaring soundtrack, and stellar crew thunderously drive it into the ground. The production simply never gels with the source material, which was much more successful in written form (a fantasy novel by Philip Pullman). Ms. Richards' spunky lead performance is drowned out by the distracting computer generated effects; most of the other live and cartoon characters are introduced improperly - as a result, they just look obvious, and you don't feel totally invested in their worth.

10,Theo Robertson,Disjointed Dark Fairy Tale Adventure,5,24 July 2013,"It says something when you almost enjoy but then have to consult Wikipedia halfway through in order to remind yourself what is going on . It was via Wikipedia that I found out a very interesting fact and that is that original novelist Philip Pullman wrote his book with a heavy anti religious tone and this almost started to make sense almost and I do emphasise almost . One can almost imagine the ruling elite of this parallel universe called the Magisterium is a metaphor for the Vatican . Did I mention almost ? Good because there's to be two things fighting against each other in this movie from a narrative point of view and I'm talking about the good guys versus the bad guys . What I mean is that despite rejecting the religious nonsense seen in the world every person reading this lives in this alternative universe is equally guilty of spiritual poppycock . All religions come under metaphysics and while not all nonsense is metaphysical just about all metaphysics is nonsense in itself . We all know someone like this is real life where someone is well educated , perhaps holding a degree in the fields of science only to let them themselves down by stating they believe in Karma or a belief that string theory suggests there's an afterlife . It's the same with THE GOLDEN COMPASS that might have rejected the existence of Abrahamic God but is happy to have other metaphysical stuff to drive the story In other words it seems like a film that is in conflict with itself as to the subtext almost as though stuff has been added to as not to alienate the believer which seems to suggest a moral cowardice of sorts . If there's stuff been added then one also gets the instinct that a lot has been take out of the film at an editing level . Characters come and go in a haphazard manner such as Daniel Craig's Lord Asriel who disappears and you keep expecting him to make a reappearance which he doesn't really . Likewise the Magisteruim's high council who you feel are just there to give some well respected actors a brief cameo to prop up the box office . There's also a much need for exposition which is a short coming . I'm left pretty clueless as to what the significance of Dust is and other plot points . I can understand that this might have been explained more if the series had gone ahead in a planned trilogy but the poor box office showing meant that idea was scrapped which is something of a pity because for what it is a - a dark fairy tale - it works very well on a visual level with some very good performances . But that said the disjointed manner of the storytelling dooms the film to a large degree",The Golden Compass
11,dbborroughs,A mess and a gutting of the book-some random thoughts,5,28 December 2008,"A dull fantasy made by people who intellectually know what fantasy is but who don't feel it. Its the difference between a my attempt at painting and a Rembrandt.Based on whats on the screen the catholics are barking up the wrong tree. the Magisterium is more Nazi Germany than Vatican. I can't see how the philosophy, at least in the hands of these people would have made a difference. The story is so lacking in meat that all the philosophy in all of ancient Greece wouldn't have helped. The story is a mess, people come and go and nothing is explained. there is no character development. People are playing to something but its not in the script...Frankly the first 40 minutes are deadly dull. not until they get on the boat does the film even begin to work. Its only after the bear shows up that it really begins to fire on most of it s cylinders- however briefly. The bear bits work- mostly.The problem is that at that point there's only an hour left.An hour? I don't know if the film would have ever really worked. The deamons bits seems contrived. I don't know if it would ever work outside of our minds.Its not a bad movie, but its so hacked up its clear that there was probably an hour that was removed from this. It has to have been removed- you can't have a movie that feels this truncated without having had filmed some of the material.I hate-hate hate hate the designs of the place where they take the children. It looks like 1960/70's designs of the future- you know the stuff that looked cool for 30 seconds before it dated. (and isn't the final flying ship sequence real cheezy?) As I said there are some good bits and the movie kind of works- certainly better than Beowulf does in 2D, but it still should have been better.I don't know whether its studio tampering(probably the bulk of the reason) or the wrong director (partly to blame). Lets pray they have a directors cut- one that puts the film back the way it should be.5ish out of 10 with bits that are much better and bits that are much worse. (Not recommended unless you see it on cable - or unless that directors cut really does show up) Of course this film is a mess- come on Christopher Lee get one line in one scene and is listed very high in the credits. Not only that its a scene made up of shots of each actor alone. there is maybe one master shot- the rest are dingle shots of the other actors- mostly Derek Jacobi.",The Golden Compass
12,Bunuel1976,"THE GOLDEN COMPASS (Chris Weitz, 2007) **1/2",6,15 November 2019,"While I am usually a sucker for fantasy adventure movies, we the audiences have been so flooded with them ever since the ""Lord Of The Rings"" trilogy emerged at the start of the century that one tends to greet a new one with a gasp rather than a cheer! With the film under review, it was similarly planned as a three-part saga but which got stalled after merely the first entry in the wake of its disappointing reception.Having watched it for myself, I can say that I was not particularly engaged by the unfolding narrative - which was, at once, muddled and undernourished anyway. It feels like the film-makers were taking it easy here, hoping to be able to expand on the themes at its core in subsequent 'episodes' - but, since this was not to be, the end result unfortunately never gathers much in the way of momentum and strides along solely on the strength of its star cast and the undeniably spectacular visuals (the Visual Effects were even rewarded with an Academy Award).Incidentally, given that I have once embarked on an infrequent review for this particular viewing, hints at the participation therein of the late great Sir Christopher Lee: at age 85, however, his contribution is restricted to one very brief exchange towards the beginning of the picture! Not that the rest of the name actors get to shine much, apart from slinky villainess Nicole Kidman (whereas ostensible leading man Daniel Craig barely registers, despite the prominence given him on the posters!). Though Sir Ian McKellen's unmistakable vocal rendition of a heroic polar bear is typically commanding, others like Sam Elliott's incongruous cowboy routine and Eva Green's surprisingly benign witch come across as eccentric while boasting little substance (read: apparent purpose) to the uninitiated. In fact, the real protagonist proves to be a child actress - who does reasonably well under the circumstances - but, as I said, she is defeated by the plot never standing a chance because it is kept so much in the background (the over-abundance of such colourful high-falutin' terms as ""Magisterium"", ""Daemons"" and ""Gobblers"" notwithstanding)...",The Golden Compass
13,utgard14,Golden Slumbers,4,31 May 2014,"First things first, I haven't read the books. Don't really want to, either, based on what I've read about them and the fact I didn't care for this film. I didn't know much about this going in. When it came out it must have been completely off my radar or else I was just very busy that year because I didn't see it then. Now that I have seen it, I'm not surprised it didn't do better at the box office or that there weren't any sequels. It's a rather dark, dull, and talky movie. How they thought this could be another successful film series on the level of Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter is beyond me. It does pick up some in the second hour. The problem is staying awake that long. The effects are okay and the cast is good but man it needs a shot of adrenaline badly. I normally like cartoon polar bears, too, but none of these drank Coca-Cola or did cute Christmas stuff. It's a shame because that would have helped the movie a lot. Oh, and in case you're wondering, Daniel Craig is barely in this.",The Golden Compass

I have to imagine as the movie ended abruptly and left me without answers.I was glad to see Nicole Kidman, Daniel Craig and Eva Green (Casino Royale), and Sam Elliott; as I was glad to hear the voice of Sir Ian McKellen. There were many others who contributed to this enjoyable movie, including, of course, newcomer Dakota Blue Richards.The effects were fantastic and earned an Oscar.

15,zardoz-13,"""The Golden Compass"" is Okay!",8,12 December 2007,"The PG-13-rated, fantasy action thriller ""The Golden Compass"" poses no more of a threat to anybody's religious convictions than the ""Star Wars"" epics, the Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, ""The Chronicles of Narnia,"" the ""Harry Potter"" potboilers, or the old ""Flash Gordon"" serials. ""American Pie"" writer & director Chris Weitz has removed virtually all traces of Catholic theology from Philip Pullman's first novel in ""His Dark Materials"" trilogy. The controversy that hovers over ""The Golden Compass"" is that youngsters will enjoy the film so much that they will expose themselves to its blasphemous source material. Consequently, many may skip this movie more for its notorious novel than its larger-than-life, fantasy laden elements that are integral to such epics. Indeed, New Line Cinema has dreams that ""The Golden Compass"" will spawn another blockbusting ""Lord of the Rings"" style trilogy. This $180 million dollar epic boasts a top-notch cast that includes Christopher Lee, Derek Jacobi, Eva Green, Nicole Kidman, Daniel Craig, Tom Courtenay, and a heavily mustached, Stetson-clad Sam Elliot as a footloose, six-gun toting cowboy/aviator. Not surprisingly, the drawling, down-home Elliot steals every scene in which he appears. Although it isn't as violent as ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, ""The Golden Compass"" is considerably more terrifying than the ""Harry Potter"" movies. The animated animals in ""The Golden Compass"" are no more realistic than those in ""The Chronicles of Narnia."" However, when the huge ice bears tangle at the half-way point of this 113 minute movie, you'll want to retreat a row or two.A plethora of parallel universes exist in ""The Golden Compass."" An eleven-year-old girl, Lyra Belacqua (Dakota Blue Richards in her big-screen acting debut) lives at Jordan College, Oxford, as an orphan-ward. The universe that our heroine inhabits is one where an individual's soul exists outside the body and takes the form of an animal called as a 'dæmon.' Everybody has a dæmon. Imagine the fortune that a pet litter firm could amass in such a place. Anyway, as our story unfolds, dark-haired Lyra reminds her best friend, Billy Costa (newcomer Charlie Rowe), that she is not a lady. Actually, Lyra behaves like a tomboy; she is as rebellious as she is mischievous. She and her dæmon, Pantalaimon, thwart an agent of the Magisterium from poisoning her uncle, Lord Asriel (a bearded Daniel Craig of ""Casino Royale"") with a bottle of spiked liquor. Incidentally, the Magisterium is an oppressive form of government that provides the citizenry with the right kinds of information to make the right choices. At no time does ""The Golden Compass"" suggest that the Magisteriumthe word originated in the Catholic Church--resembles anything akin to the Nazi-like dictatorship that repressed the universe in the black & white Flash Gordon serials in the 1930s. Asriel learns that the Magisterium wants to silence him permanently so that he cannot show irrevocable proof that elementary particles designated as 'Dust' flows from another parallel universe into their own, in the far North. Meanwhile, the Magisterium insists that Dust doesn't exist. Nevertheless, Asriel mounts a university-funded expedition to the far North. Of course, the dastardly Magisterium knows all along about the existence of Dust and associates it with original sin. At the same time, the Magisterium is trying to inoculate children against its effects.After Lord Asriel heads off north, Lyra's two friends Billy Costa and Roger vanish under mysterious circumstances. Our heroine fears that the folkloric ""Gobblers"" have abducted them. Naturally, headstrong Lyra sets out to rescue them. Initially, she has no way of traveling to the north herself until a woman of prominence, Mrs. Marisa Coulter, enters her life and asks her to join her as her assistant on her excursion to the north. Lyra jumps at the opportunity. Before she leaves Oxford, the Master of the College gives her with a secret object called an alethiometer. Although it looks like a golden compass, this device works like a lie detector to furnish the answer to any question that the owner asks ""The Golden Compass"" is a terrific looking movie. ""Flyboys"" lenser Henry Braham makes this movie a widescreen feast for the eyes and the animation is pretty good, too. Had the animals appeared anymore realistic, the fantasy atmosphere would have suffered, especially since these beasts rip and tear into each other with considerable ferocity. The ice bears belt out deafening roars that would cover up a tornado siren.""The Golden Compass"" concludes on a heroic finale that leaves it open to an inevitable sequel. This abundance of exposition required to acquaint us with the fantasy worlds here means that you must pay close attention to the dialogue if you want to assimilate its complex plot elements. Altogether, this chick flick combination of ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" meets ""Harry Potter"" generates a lot of excitement and gives us an adventurous heroine who wins our sympathy while she saves her loved ones.",The Golden Compass
16,Calicodreamin,Pretty good movie,7,17 September 2019,"The golden compass is a pretty comparable children's movie. The acting is well done, both from the kids and adults. The cast ensemble is made up of some fairly prominent names. I quite enjoyed watching, though I'm still not sure I get what dust is, or why the college let Nicole Kidman take the girl ""as an assistant"". It was all fairly good, watching ioryek slap the jaw off a polar bear was a highlight.

17,view_and_review,I Choose Willy Wonka's Golden Ticket Over The Golden Compass,5,26 May 2021,"This was a big budget movie that failed to distinguish itself. A long journey centered around a kid, a special compass, and a prophecy. The protagonist would show bravery, intelligence, and all the things you want to see in a protagonist. There were allies and enemies along the way and plenty of CGI.

18,neil-476,Tolerable fantasy,6,13 April 2009,"I have read the first couple of dozen pages of the first book, but it's fair to say that I'm looking at The Golden Compass simply as a film.There are some good things here. The idea of the daemon being the vehicle which carries the soul is a good one, but while it is entertainingly demonstrated, it is never developed in any way. And there is a very definite sense of this tale taking place in a world which is similar to, but very different from, our own. There is some decent CGI (though not all of it, by any means) and some good voice talent.And there are some things which aren't so good. The main one is that, stripped of the subtext which I understand is present in the books, the film becomes an utterly generic quest taking place in a fantasy world, driven by special effects as much as plot. The theological / metaphysical discussions concerning dust, which kick in right at the start with Eva Green's voice-over, serve merely to confuse. Daniel Craig, potentially the film's strongest card, is hardly in it, and Nicole Kidman seems to not know quite what to do with her role. Most of the secondary playing is fine, though.Also, the ending - clearly pointing at a part 2 which, given the poor showing of part 1, seems unlikely - being an unresolved cliffhanger, proves to be broadly unsatisfactory.",The Golden Compass
19,ferguson-6,A lot to Sort Out,4,1 December 2007,"Greetings again from the darkness. I would love to compare this to ""Chronicles of Narnia"", ""Pan's Labrynth"" or any of the 'Potter' films, but it just doesn't come close. The story plods to the point of boring and only a couple of action scenes even give credence to special effects crew ... or better yet, community.With a stellar cast and a popular novel (by the controversial Philip Pullman), director Chris Weitz is just plain overmatched. He delivers a mishmash of individual scenes and just can't connect the dots into a cohesive story. Some of the shots are out of focus and the score is weak and flat and distracting.The few bright spots are delivered by the Ice Bears (really cool) and three of the greatest voices of all time ... Sir Ian McKellan, Christopher Lee (regretably only one line) and Sam Elliott. Also terrific is newcomer Dakota Blue Richards as Lyra. She definitely has something. Nice to see Daniel Craig and one of his Bond girls (Eva Green) back together ... though not actually sharing a scene. Also good is Jim Carter in a supporting role.Nicole Kidman just can't pull off her role and I am not sure if it the way the character is written or the manner in which she plays it. Compare her to Tilda Swinton in ""Narnia"" and you'll see what I mean. Nicole (who appears to be 7 ft tall in most scenes) just doesn't have the same icy stare, despite some colorized eye balls! This one is just downright disappointing and I believe most kids will find it boring and unsatisfying ... most adults will as well.",The Golden Compass
20,anaconda-40658,Visuals Move Ahead.,7,10 February 2016,"The Golden Compass (2007): Dir: Chris Weitz / Cast: Dakota Blue Richards, Nicole Kidman, Daniel Craig, Sam Elliott, Eva Green: Adventure about guidance as a golden compass is thrust into the possession of a young girl. Interesting directing choice for Chris Weitz after directing About a Boy and the dreadful Down to Earth. He has managed to switch up genres while keeping his resume semi interesting. Exciting and adventurous that turns to constant action within the third act. Dakota Blue Richards does well as the young lead holding her own against her much more famous co-stars as well as the exquisite special effects surrounding her. She plays off intelligence in the face of adult adversary. Nicole Kidman plays an enchanting seductress named Mrs. Coulter whose downfall was underestimating Richards. Daniel Craig is featured as Richards' uncle in what is mostly a standard role but Craig rises above it. Sam Elliott also rises above conventions as a Texan who flies a plane. He leads Richards to an armored polar bear where she seeks help but first she must witness a massive battle between two of the polar warriors. Eva Green plays a witch queen, which is not much of a stretch from her usual roles. Pointless and often corny with animal companions that seem to double as souls. Weird storytelling but the visual elements are tremendous and render the compass a worthwhile adventure. Score: 7 ½ / 10",The Golden Compass
21,gradyharp,A Fantasy with a Strong Cast of Humans and Animated Animals!,7,3 May 2008,"Not being one who seeks out the seemingly endless line of Harry Potter/Narnia/Lord of the Rings tropes (a little computer generated monster realm goes a long way), THE GOLDEN COMPASS came somewhat as a pleasant surprise. Yes, this is still a fantasy film, but the emphasis is more on stylish creation of various animals (in the forms of 'daemons' that accompany children as their souls, morphing into various animal life at will) than tiresome explosions and flying beasties. Lyra (Dakota Blue Richards) is clearly the star of this adventure that explores the possibility of other, parallel worlds whose interaction with the world as we know it is controlled by various groups of good guys and bad guys, all seeking the source of secrecy contained in a Golden Compass that can only be read by a single girl - Lyra, a poor child living in the presence of scholars. Lyra's uncle, Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig) places the Golden Compass in Lyra's knowing hands and heads off to the far North to investigate the element that binds all life together - Dust. The tale is set in motion by the enigmatic Mrs. Coulter (Nicole Kidman) who gains Lyra's confidence and offers to take her to the great North. All manner of adventures occur on the journey - friends of Lyra's are threatened to be separated from their various daemons in the cruel hands of the bad guys, Lyra's encounter with a witch Serafina Pekkala (Eva Green), her assistance from a friendly astronaut (Sam Elliott) and an armored bear - and with all fantasies, good prevails - or does it? Tune in for the very obvious next installment. The pleasures are many, not the least of which are the voices and changing forms of the little animal daemons. The cast is excellent and the whole movie sails with yet another beautiful musical score by Alexandre Desplat. It is a nice diversion, but you have to love fantasy. Grady Harp",The Golden Compass
22,zetes,"I, for one, loathed it",3,10 December 2007,"An unmitigated disaster. It's a charmless Lord of the Rings cash-in. I believe that the producers had a lot to do with its failure. New Line Cinema desperately wanted a new fantasy franchise, and I imagine they demanded that this one come in under two hours so they could have more showtimes. The film is nothing but exposition and plot, moving breathlessly between locales and introducing scads of characters for whom I couldn't give a rat's ass. We're never allowed to know any of these people, not even the protagonist, a precocious preteen played by Dakota Blue Richards. Things happen so quickly and dialogue is delivered so rapidly, I felt like I was watching Speed Racer. I've heard the novel is actually quite good. I imagine it's better than this, but I was rather annoyed at one major conceit of Philip Pullman's universe: every human being on his alternate Earth has a spirit animal, called a daemon, that follows them around. This idea allows the filmmakers, at any rate, to be lazy. When they want to tell us a character is bad, their daemon is a snake or a beetle, or a filthy monkey. When they're good, they make them something noble, like a bird or a tiger or something. This is just really bad storytelling. The film, of course, ends with plot strings showing, letting us know that there will be sequels. Even though the film has already tanked, they'll probably make them anyway. I certainly won't be in attendance. You shouldn't make the initial mistake of seeing this one.",The Golden Compass
23,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: The Golden Compass,7,5 December 2007,"I have not read the books, so to ignorant people like me, we are told in the prologue that the known universe is made up of many parallel worlds (which we will see only in the sequels), and in this one, every person has a Daemon, which is an animal representation of one's soul, kind of like the totems in the animated series Visionaries, only that they live side by side, and can be interacted with. Granted, if the Daemon/soul dies, the body dies with it too, and vice versa. We follow the exploits of Lyra, a natural liar, who gets in her possession The Golden Compass so that she can take it to Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig), who has set off to discover the origins of Dust (like Spice in Dune, only that it appears in the icy cold Northern regions, and looks very much like the Aurora Boreali, hence the English title Northern Lights), only that the concept of Dust is akin to original sin, thereby bringing allusions to religion into the plot.Director Chris Weitz has stated that the religious overtones in the movie has been dumbed down, and that I agree. While The Authority and the Magisterium refers so obviously to God and the Church, these are mentioned only in passing, so much so that you do not even care much about the characters, and want your recognizable stars on screen as much as they can. Daniel Craig gets pretty much what you see in the trailer, save for something which I thought was quite Bond like with his experiencing what George Lazenby did during his stint On Her Majesty's Secret Service. Eva Green returns as a witchy archer (LOTR Reference #1), but thankfully doesn't share any screen time with Craig, lest we scream ""Finish her, Bond!"". Nicole Kidman, given top billing in the movie, actually does quite little, with her Mrs Coulter, as head of the a secret police, much like any authoritarian regime would have. All she needed to do was to fit into beautiful gowns with some dalliances here and there, and that's it. Again, she doesn't share screen time with Criag, lest we scream ""No! His body has been snatched!"". So who does the weight of this movie fall on? Dakota Blue Richards.Given that she's a fresh face picked from thousands of contenders, she ought to be good. And thankfully, yes. She becomes the new Frodo with her own Sam (LOTR Reference #2) - her daemon Pam (voiced by Freddie Highmore), gathering her own Fellowship from the likes of Gyptians (like Merry Men from Caribbean Pirates), witches, a renegade cowboy (Sam Elliott in yet another of such roles), and the Aragon (LOTR Reference #3) of her gang, the Polar Bear prince-in-exile Iorek Byrnison (voiced by Ian McKellen, LOTR Reference #4) who saves her hide time and again. In fact, the polar bear hear provides much needed action entertainment, like an incredible Hulk each time brawn is required. While the movie is mainly talk and plenty of running away, the bear provides some balls in standing up and fighting for what's his, or what's contracted, hence becoming the highlight of the movie.But as with all good things, if it's milked too often, the novelty wears off, such as having Lyra riding on his back like a girl on an amusement park pony ride. So nice was the animation and the grandeur of the scale, that we get to see it again, and again, and again. We don't want to see the bear as a pony, but an ass-kicking bad mofo since it talks so tough, get it? And the only other battle scene The Golden Compass has, is the final battle which is a notch better than that from The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe, probably assisted by less theatrics.Granted, this movie is not about action, but I do want to add that it does help to spice tihngs up in between the mambo jumbo talk of the Magisterium feeling threatened, talks of Chosen Ones, and the threat of what could be the mother of all evil contraptions, which turned out looking like a human sized bird cage with the power to split out a human's soul, turning one into a mindless, obedient servant of the Magisterium, whose advice to the masses is always good and pure (yeah right, and hmm), and whose objective is to establish a nanny state. Probably those calling for the boycott of the movie will tell me that I miss out on the more obvious point that the story promotes atheism, but to that I say ""pah"", give me my year end sword and sorcery movie instead, without the hullabaloo of how it screws religion up, ala the big fight and debate with Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ, and Ron Howard's The Da Vinci Code.",The Golden Compass
24,SimonJack,"Mostly a confused mess, but good visuals",3,3 September 2017,"This fantasy film doesn't fit with the general genre of fairy tales. It's far too dark for that. I don't know how closely the film follows the novel by Philip Pullman. I can see why it's PG-13, because there's way too much frightening stuff for kids in ""The Golden Compass."" The screenplay doesn't achieve a clear separation of the good and bad in the scenes of violence. Whatever message may have been intended surely wasn't clear – unless it was confusion. For older kids and adults, it's not very well done. The screenplay is hard to follow, or make connections in places. The one very good thing about the production is the melding of the animation, CGI and real life characters and scenes. For that the film deserved it Oscar for best visual effects. But the story is to disjointed, and there's nothing special about any of the acting. I wonder why Nicole Kidman would take the part of Mrs. Coulter in this movie. Movie makers who want to do fantasies of this sort should study Peter Jackson's work in ""The Lord of the Rings"" series.",The Golden Compass

The acting was good, the special effects appropriate and the overall story, even if a bit ""on fast forward"" was interesting.Basically, it's like another Chronicles of Narnia, but with a different story. And it's better than the said film, also. The cast is remarkable, although I couldn't help make fun of both Eva Green and Daniel Craig, which also starred in Casino Royale. Putting 007 lines as Golden Compass ones was really fun.",The Golden Compass
26,JamesHitchcock,Remains faithful to Pullman's imaginative vision,7,17 December 2007,"Philip Pullman's novel is set in a ""parallel universe"". In some respects it is an alternative history, a vision of what Britain and the world could have become under different historical circumstances. The technology of this world is similar to that of the real world in the late twentieth century, with the major difference that it has not mastered heavier-than-air flight; air journeys are made by Zeppelin or balloon. Politically, however, Britain is not a democracy but a dictatorship dominated by a sinister organisation called the Magisterium, who also rule many other parts of the world. In other respects, however, the book is a supernatural fantasy. Pullman's world is not just our world with a different political system. It is a world where witches fly through the air, and where the Arctic regions are dominated by intelligent polar bears who have the power of speech and highly developed metalworking skills, which they use to fashion intricate armour for themselves. It is a world where every human is accompanied from birth to death by a ""daemon"", a visible representation of their soul in animal form. Children's daemons have the power to change shape, but when they reach adulthood they become fixed, in a form which reflects the owner's personality. The main character is Lyra Belacqua, a young girl who grows up in Jordan College, Oxford, believing herself to be an orphan. Later, we discover that her real parents are Lord Asriel, an explorer and scientist experiments have earned him the disfavour of the Magisterium, and the beautiful but sinister Marisa Coulter. When Roger, a kitchen-boy at the College, vanishes, rumour spreads that he has been kidnapped by the Gobblers, a mysterious organisation believed to be responsible for the disappearance of children all over the country. Lyra sets out on a mission to rescue him, an adventure which will eventually take her beyond the arctic Circle. In this she has the assistance of the Gyptians, a tribe of seafaring gypsies, a Texan balloonist named Lee Scoresby, Serafina Pekkala, a beautiful witch-queen, and an armoured bear named Iorek Byrnison. The title refers to an ""alethiometer"", a device which comes into Lyra's possession and which can be used to foretell the future or answer any question. This film has aroused great controversy on account of Pullman's allegedly anti-Christian views. I did not find the book anti-Christian, reading it as an attack on the misuse of religion for selfish ends rather than on religion itself. The film tends to play down the religious content of the book; in the novel the Magisterium is the governing body of an all-powerful Church, whereas in the film it could also be interpreted as the ruling elite of a secular dictatorship. Only occasionally is its religious nature hinted at; its leaders, for example, describe their opponents as ""heretics"". Indeed, most of the negative comments on this board are not from devout Christians complaining that the film has insulted their faith but from devout Pullmanists complaining that it has deviated from their sacred texts by changing Pullman's plot or omitting their favourite episode. Certainly, the film does occasionally depart from the original story; the characters of Billy Costa and Tony Makarios, for example, are combined, and there is no mention of the Aurora Borealis. (This doubtless explains why the American title was used for the film on both sides of the Atlantic; the book was published in Britain as ""Northern Lights""). The most significant changes, apart from the watering down of the Magisterium's religious character, are those which smooth out the book's moral ambiguities. There is a much sharper dividing line between the good characters and the evil ones. Iorek is exiled from the Kingdom of the Bears after being defeated in single combat, not (as in the book) after killing another bear. The attempt to poison Lord Asriel is made by an agent of the Magisterium, not the Master of Jordan. The film, unlike the book, does not end with Roger's death at Asriel's hands. Changes of this nature, however, are inevitable whenever a novel is adapted for the cinema; a film which attempted to preserve every detail would doubtless be excessively long and slow-moving. The film remains faithful to the most important quality of Pullman's book, his imaginative ability to create an alternative world which is both like ours and at the same time very different. The alternate-reality London conjured up is a good deal more elegant than the real city, a blend of monumental Classicism, Gothicism and Art Deco, even if some of the computer generated buildings did look rather insubstantial. The CGI used to create the daemons and the armoured bears is impressively convincing; the battle between Iorek and his rival Ragnar is one of the highlights. Indeed, one might even say that the computer generated characters, especially Iorek (voiced by Ian McKellen) and Lyra's shape-shifting daemon Pantalaimon, are the real stars of the film. There are, however, also some good contributions from the human characters. Pullman's Lyra is an enchanting heroine- brave, determined and resourceful- and young Dakota Blue Richards succeeds well in fleshing her out. The lovely Nicole Kidman is splendidly seductive as the villainous Mrs Coulter. Asriel's role, however, is smaller in the film than in the book, so there is relatively little for Daniel Craig to do. Of the supporting cast, the best was Sam Elliott as Scoresby. Recent years have seen a glut of fantasy movies, inspired by the success of the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. ""The Golden Compass"" is not quite of the same standard as that masterpiece, but it is an a par with, say, ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" and some of the Harry Potter films, and better than ""The Order of the Phoenix"", the latest episode in that franchise. It is certainly better than the disappointing ""Eragon"". It is a very entertaining fantasy for all the family. 7/10",The Golden Compass
27,Smells_Like_Cheese,"One of those ""You gotta read the book"" movies",5,24 May 2008,"I remember last year seeing the trailer for The Golden Compass, now I'll be honest, I had no interest what so ever in seeing this film, but after seeing the Oscars, it was nominated for a few awards, so I wondered maybe if I had just misjudged the film. So I rented it this week and watched it yesterday with a very open mind; while the movie was nicely made, the one thing I did not appreciate was this is a movie where if you haven't read the book, you'll have no idea what they are talking about really. The effects, the acting, the editing, etc. was very good, it's just the story that really gets your brain in an overload and at the end of the movie, you'll be like ""What movie did I watch?"".Lyra Belacqua lives in a very different world than our own, where pets are called ""demons"" and they can talk and change shape. But apparently there is some kind of organization where the demons and the children are being torn away from each other and the kids just disappear. When Lyra is taken by a beautiful woman, Marisa Coulter, but Marisa isn't so trust worthy when Lyra finds out that she's the one behind the organization and wants to use her for her special talent to read the golden compass and see into the world.The Golden Compass is a decent film, but like I said I was just disappointed in the fact that you really will not get a lot if you haven't read the book. But from what I am reading here on IMDb, the people who have read the book say that this film is a let down for them, so I'm kind of in a confused state more so now than when I finished this film. As for a family film? This movie does have a little violence and scares here and there, but over all I think it's safe for the kids. Everything about this film except for the over the top story is decent, but maybe the sequel will make more sense, hopefully.5/10",The Golden Compass
28,Buddy-51,a true mixed bag of strengths and weaknesses,5,28 July 2010,"Based on the novel by Philip Pullman (the first of a trilogy), ""The Golden Compass"" takes us to a parallel universe where humans mind-meld with shape-shifting creatures known as daemons, children are kidnapped and ""re-programmed"" to live without those daemons, and society is ruled by a mysterious, all-powerful Magisterium that tells people what they are to think and how they are to live. Lyra (Dakota Blue Richards) is a feisty young orphan whose uncle, Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig), is hot on the trail of a scientific discovery regarding the nature of the universe - a discovery that, if proved true, could completely upend the paradigm that allows the Magisterium to remain in power. Naturally, Lyra is one of only a handful of very special people who possess the gift of unlocking the mystery of a golden compass said to hold the key to something or other of great importance (in all honesty, this type of mystical mumbo-jumbo is not exactly my cup of tea). British and American acting stalwarts Ian McKellen, Tom Courtenay, Christopher Lee, Sam Elliott, Derek Jacobi, and Nicole Kidman round out the cast.Much has been made of the supposed anti-religion/pro-science slant in the story (""magisterium"" is the term for the teaching authority of the Roman Catholic Church), and, indeed, Pullman, a renowned Freethinker, has admitted that he wrote his trilogy of fantasy novels (called, collectively, ""His Dark Materials"") partly as a rebuttal to C.S. Lewis' ""Narnia"" series - though the Magisterium doesn't seem to be any more objectionable as a literary device than the societal super-structures we find in ""Brave New World"" or ""1984"" or ""Fahrenheit 451,"" or countless other such tales (though I gather that the movie somewhat dilutes this aspect of the original story anyway).If truth be told, I really don't have much use for films of this genre, but I will say that I find the movie version of ""The Golden Compass"" to be a bit more imaginative and a trifle less plodding than the recent cinematization of ""Chronicles of Narnia."" Plus, ""Compass"" provides a sometimes breathtakingly beautiful vision of what life might be like on a parallel planet. But, when all is said and done, it's still just the same old mishmash of talking animals, mythological creatures, precocious youngsters, fantasy battle sequences and over-worked allegory we've encountered oh so many times before.Stay tuned for the next installment.",The Golden Compass
29,Robert_duder,"Controvery not withstanding, The Golden Compass fails on other levels",8,25 December 2007,"The Golden Compass is not a bad film at all. I have not read the books although I would like to now and it has some definitively beautiful scenes, terrific action and battles and some good performances. Unfortunately the film falls into a lot of traps of a good epic and falls short of the greatness it could have been. First of all it had the distinction of being the only fantasy epic this year without any other Harry Potter, Lord Of The Rings etc. epics against it so fantasy fans could have flocked out. Sure I will agree that in North America the religious controversy may have hurt it at a little but I find it hard to believe the church (in particular the Catholic church) has that much pull on the average person. I do however see bits and pieces of the controversy that got them fired up. The film is far from a children's film...perhaps very mature children, or teenagers but it has a heavy theme to it and some really brutal scenes. It's definitely not played down like perhaps Chronicles of Narnia was which I think this is most closely compared to. The Golden Compass is like the polar opposite of Narnia. The message is darker, scarier, more violent. Still the problem with The Golden Compass is that it's rushed. It feels like vital pieces of the story are missing and all this information is coming at you with no explanation or background to give you. Plot holes take a new level but a big part of that is the lack of the information they give you.Newcomer Dakota Blue Richards is excellent in the coveted role of Lyra Belacqua. She's sassy and strong and makes for a terrific lead role and handles it like a pro. She acts opposite Nicole Kidman like she's been in the business for years. I think even if the film fails she'll do well because of it. She has a bright future. Speaking of...Nicole Kidman plays Mrs. Coulter, the villains to the whole film. Kidman does a good job of playing dark, and somewhat evil and somehow disturbingly perfect looking. I think she has that part down to a science. Although I really don't think they developed the character as much as they could have. Daniel Craig plays a small and yet significant role as Lord Asriel and does a great job with a small role. He is and has been a powerful screen presence and even more now and a small role for him captures your attention. One of the true highlights of the film is the CGI character Iorek Byrnison (the Bear King) voiced by the incomparable Ian McKellen. McKellen is always a huge presence on screen and his voice is no exception behind the massive Bear King who becomes literally a huge part of the film and one of the best. Freddie Highmore was also terrific as the beloved Pan (Lyra's Daemon---or soul.) Sam Elliott is good but severely underused in his role. He barely makes a flicker even though you feel like he should be a bigger part of the story.If the film makers including director and writer Chris Weitz should be credited for anything it should be the brilliant and breath taking cinematography which is just literally amazing. They created this incredible world and you wanted to see so much more of it and learn more about it but they didn't submerge you enough into it. They rushed through the story and forced it together leaving gaping holes and us wanting so much more from the first installment. I don't think Weitz has the experience or talent to make this type of film that should define epic. Nonetheless there are some incredible scenes including (and my personal favorite) the huge battle between Iorek Byrnison and the impostor King (a la Hamlet) that has a disturbingly shocking and violent outcome. The characters are all excellent and the world is brilliant and moving and even the story which is very muddled in this interpretation is easily seen as terrific but somehow the film makers made some fatal errors and I can only hope that if future installments are made (and I truly hope they do) that someone with great talent and experience can take this over and make one incredible series...controversy aside...adults and level headed, mature youngsters can enjoy this epic. 8.5/10",The Golden Compass
30,dromasca,in the shade Harry Potter,7,9 December 2007,"'Golden Compass' is based on the first of a cycle of books by Philip Pullman, and belongs to the genre of family fantasy. Its main problem may that this genre seems to suffer of a sudden inflation this season. On the road open by Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter series many other producers and directors try to find the golden eggs. In the US theater where I saw the movie yesterday (first Saturday after the launching) no less than four trailers announced movies in the same genre. This is way too much.Not to mention that not all stories are like Tolkien's and not all teenagers have the appeal of Harry Potter and of his friends. 'Golden Compass' is not a bad movie by any account. It creates a sophisticated world, it has interesting symbols and allusions to current affairs and eternal fight between freedom and tyranny, it is well acted, and complex enough not to be boring even for mature audiences. Yet, in almost any aspect I can think about it comes an inch below the Harry Potter movies for example. Yes, I am a more experienced viewer of such films than five years ago, and you need to make something new to really impress me. Inflation hurts.",The Golden Compass
31,MLDinTN,very forgettable and boring,2,28 December 2008,"I didn't like this movie. I have never read the books, but my guess is a lot of background and side plots that are in the books were left out of this film. And this film ends set up for a sequel, which may not come. Just not a good ending. Daniel Craig is billed as a star, but he was hardly in the movie. Nicole Kidman had a little more screen time and I liked her character, Mrs. Coulter, the best. She made a good scheming, cold hearted wench. If you know nothing about the movie before hand, it makes little sense in the beginning. Apparently the story takes place in an alternate universe. People have deamons, which are animals that their soul lies in. When they die, the deamon dies. The ice bears were good special effects. Although their purpose didn't add anything to the story to me. The main character is the little girl, Lyra, whom is the only one who can read the Golden Compass. It would have been nice if we would have learned more about the compass and what the pictures meant. Very little is even revealed in this film.FINAL VERDICT: Story not congruent, boring. I don't recommend it.",The Golden Compass

Dakota Blue Richards is darn perfect for the role of Lyra. Daniel Craig and Nicole Kidman were great as their retrospective parts. The plot is nice and sound until the ending. Several delightable scenes were cut. The music was good, but it seems that there is no theme song for the film. Last of all, what's the big deal about the movie and atheism.

33,ericstevenson,I've at least heard of the book,6,15 January 2017,"This is a movie based on a book in a series known as ""His Dark Materials"" by Philip Pullman. The book has garnered some controversy because Pullman explicitly made the book out to be anti-religious. From what I know, the anti-religious stuff was downplayed in this film version. I guess you could compare him to Douglas Adams and his Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy books, another anti-religious writer. Of course, his movie was certainly better than this. I could get a couple anti-religious vibes in this. It did talk about skepticism and heretics, but only briefly.The movie's main fault is that it came across as pretty silly to me. What happened is that these people are trying to stop these other people from discovering magic dust that proves the existence of other worlds. Yeah, it's a really goofy sounding premise. It takes place in this world where everyone has a shapeshifting creature or ""daemon"". Maybe if I read the books, I could comprehend it better. The movie often suffers from really bad CGI. Everything looks pretty fake. I still thought the actors were quite good. There really was an all star cast here with Christopher Lee and Sam Elliot. I wish they were in the movie more! Oh wait, Christopher Lee was in every movie back then. Besides, ""Lord Of The Rings"" was pro-religious. Maybe fans of the book were disappointed that it wasn't more anti-religious? I just thought it was a movie that wasn't that well acted with kind of a silly story. It seems like everyone is against religion nowadays. Hey, a lot of people hate my reviews regardless of my beliefs, which I don't really discuss anyway. I really did like this movie's pacing as literally half of it was them at the North Pole, which the first half set up.

34,Bored_Dragon,Better than the series,7,30 March 2020,"George R.R. Martin cited this movie as one of the reasons he wanted ""Game of Thrones"" to be adapted into a series rather than a movie. I'm glad about that decision, but ironically, this movie is quite better than the current series. I haven't read the books, so I can't judge the faithfulness to the source material, but as the stories in the movie and the series differ only in nuances, I believe both are fairly faithful to the novel. However, I prefer the approach to the story in the film, because the film is a fairly clear and rounded whole, while the series is confusing and, frankly, if I didn't have a fan of the book next to me, I would have no idea what I was looking at. I also prefer the cast choices in the movie, and the fairytale atmosphere, as opposed to the overly dark atmosphere of the series. I was most pleasantly surprised by the effects, which are much better in the movie, in spite of the movie being more than a decade older than the series. I am not thrilled with the movie either, and according to Philip Pullman fans, without prior knowledge of the book it is quite understandable, but compared to the series, this is a significant improvement, not to say that the series is a step backwards from the film.7/10",The Golden Compass

The film--compared to the book--was somewhat eviscerated by the producers' attempts to defuse criticism by the religious right and others. But what is left is fantastic.By the way, one can understand why those who are under the spell of the power churches would, out of hand, want to stifle this project. The books do a great job of exposing the hypocrisies and the shallowness of those who gain power and control through religion.This film has much to recommend it. The acting is superb--especially Nicole Kidman's portrayal of Mrs. Coulter, an icy villainess.The special effects are more than adequate in support of the out-of-this-world story. Likewise, the costuming and music.I only hope there is a sequel. And I also hope that the tone of the story can include more of the author's brilliant views of the world--without regard for the fear mongers who are themselves afraid of challenging viewpoints.",The Golden Compass
36,tabuno,Gorgeous But Disappointing,6,21 January 2019,"16 December 2007. The Golden Compass is different and being different it requires the audience to have to take a leap of faith and re-orientation itself into a parallel universe. Sometimes this re-orientation isn't always as successful as the producers, director, and script writers wanted. One of the major problems with this movie is its lack of real world human context. Yes there are humans, but not really humans - these humans have daemons which closely sound like demons but they aren't demons at all. Unlike Naria, we don't have actual humans like the ones were are used. Another problem with this movie is its ending. Unlike Lord of the Rings which is better known and known for its different books and parts, The Golden Compass isn't expected to be a multi-part film and so the expectation at the end of the movie the ending isn't what the audience expects and feels more like a television serial...Another problem with this movie is it's emphasis on special effects and large budget production values and unfortunately, the art designs and computer specialists weren't up to the task...with Star Wars the most recent episodes, the apparently fake-looking city landscapes do injustice to the rest of the movie and the animals aren't always authentic looking either in all respects. Finally, there are plot points, escapes that defy imagination that appear to be more for convenience, there are too many ""aw how that that happened?"" moments. It seems that the scriptwriters just weren't up to the task of offering the audience an explanation or the director or studio just couldn't afford to please the audience in this way. Being partial Nicole Kidman, her role was deliciously wickedly complex that includes a more complicated character instead of being a two-dimensional one. Some of her silent moments on screen were some of her most brilliant, perhaps even thanks to Chris Wietz for offering up some of those precious opportunities. As for the main lead, Dakota Richards's character is also somewhat disconcerting...intensely independent and rebellious, it is sometimes hard to be sympathetic to a character that sometimes is portrayed more as a brat than a girl. At times she's demanding, commanding, someone sometimes hard to be around. Finally, the level of adult violence is such that this movie appears to cross the line of juvenile family movie into something older...bordering on an adolescent movie with a much too young main lead. The odd, part of this critique is that for all of the problems with this movie, a sequel is actually an intriguing concept...if the parallel universes collide and more of an authentic human component in the next movie occurs. The set up in this previous parallel universe would make a fabulous introduction into the next universe, predictably a sequel would actually be a better movie than the original one. This richly, evocative and ambitious movie unfortunately falls under the weigh of too many weaknesses, the religious controversy notwithstanding. Six out of Ten Stars.",The Golden Compass
37,The-Sarkologist,Don't bother,2,3 March 2012,"I was originally going to rate this movie higher but at the last moment decided not to namely because it is very clearly anti-Christian. The story behind the books upon which this movie is based is that the writer, Philip Pullman, was so outraged at the blatant evangelism of the Narnia Chronicles that he decided to write a series of fantasy novels, aimed at children, to counter C.S. Lewis' Christian beliefs. While I am a firm believer of freedom of speech, and will never seek to silence somebody's opinion (within reason of course. Freedom of speech should never, ever, justify racial hate speech), the motives behind the writing of these novels simply do not garner my respect.While I could write more on this movie (though I am unlikely to read the novels, nor recommend them to anybody), I won't waste any more time on this analysis.",The Golden Compass
38,Dr_Coulardeau,Let's revisit the wonderlands of girls,10,23 December 2007,"We are invited to revisit so many old tales like The Wizard of Oz and his Dororthy, or Alice and her Wonderland, or Snow-white and her bad step mother or Cinderella and her own bad stepmother. We must admit we are coming back from very far when we look at the most traditional image of women, or girls, in fairy tales and other children's stories. Think of Little Red Riding Hood who sleeps with a wolf, or Sleeping Beauty who cannot but prick her finger on the first spinning wheel she meets. This tale is for girls and this tale is built on a couple. On one side the bad guy, Marisa Coulter, and on the other side the good girl, Lyra. Refreshing. To make it modern and charming the author adds two elements. First animals who are fascinatingly good on the good side and outrageously bad on the bad side, with the polar bears in between, good or bad according to the king they have. Animals have always fascinated children. Then some good special effects to make the movie a dreaming machine with all types of possible fantasies and visions beyond the surface of things. The film is thus conceived as a mirror handed and stretched out to girls for them to fall in the Wonderland it proposes. At the same time it is modern too and tries to get the boys in the theaters by having some good battles, particularly the general one between Marisa Coulter's army and the gypsies who are on the right side and helped by the bears. There definitely is some charm in this film and girls are coming back to the forefront after a long long absence from it. Dorothy and Alice were so long ago. Unluckily we will have to waif for some time if we want to know whether Lyra will save her father or not. That's the only thing I regret. The general meaning is that a child, a girl as well as a boy, must remain rebellious and must disobey orders from adult authority because that adult world is hiding the truth of life and is aiming at cutting these children off (castrate them in a way) from their wild, free and imaginative animal spirits. We have to save children from normalization and standardization, so that they can forever see the cosmic dust that surrounds us and follow the tracks of the golden compass of their imagination and dreams.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",The Golden Compass
39,johnnyboyz,Hollywood's 'dark days' just keep on getting blacker.,4,13 December 2007,"The Golden Compass is a film that is close to all but dead within its first twenty minutes; a film that is too complicated for an audience of children say, under the age of fifteen, and a film too lacking in any adult content or actual brains to appeal to anyone over the age of eighteen. The Golden Compass is a film that will have you asking questions; but not the sort of questions that you knock about after the film regarding its appeal or intelligence but those that have you asking ""Just what were they thinking?"" Even as a Hollywood, CGI fun-fest; the film still manages to fail pretty miserably with its lack of conflict; lack of characterisation and its over reliance on gimmicks that I'm sure probably worked on paper but don't on the screen.I wasn't aware of the fact this was based on a book until some further research after watching the film; from what I've read, people don't like the adaptation. From what I've also read, people want everyone to boycott the film over a religion row: let me tell you that boycotting the film is a brilliant idea but not anywhere near for the reason of religion bashing  merely for the fact this is a big, wide mass of nothingness that would trick us into believing things that would never happen and I'm not talking about having to suspend belief about a talking polar bear here. Even for a film that falls into the fantasy genre, The Golden Compass manages to remain dull and unimaginative. Its idea that these people (who inhabit an alternate 'Earth) have their souls on their outside is an interesting one and one that all credit must go toward the author of the novel and yet on screen, we are supposed to relate to these characters by way of their animal accomplices ie; Lord Asriel's (Craig) is a tiger: strong and powerful who knows what's what; Marisa Coulter (Kidman) has a monkey of some sort; suggesting not a playful and cheeky persona but one that could change from good to aggressive very quickly; the other example is of the hero; Lyra Belacqua (Richards) whose daemon keeps changing from cat to bird to chipmunk suggesting she hasn't quite 'found herself' yet although the fact she's only about ten probably has something to do with this. Fine, you think but the faceless enemy soldiers that guard utopian government looking buildings as disturbing experiments go on inside are all accompanied with either Doberman dogs or wolves  do the guards not have personalities? This is a glaring lack of consistency.The actual character hero of Lyra was also a problem. There are too many scenes that rely on child acting in this film and what's more, Lyra goes about her adventure as if she's twenty years older that what she actually is. She is smarter than she should be; braver and more of a leader than she should be. More often than not, she achieves things adult characters cannot: persuading the polar bear to join them; destroying the 'cutting' device and being able to negotiate her way out of death with a king polar bear who is a hundred times more powerful than she is. Of course if she was any older, the film would be Tomb Raider mixed with Narnia but that's a different story. I'm sure there was a story in The Golden Compass somewhere but there's me thinking it was perhaps going to go down the route of Indiana Jones or The Mummy; how wrong I was. The film sets up its idea for its narrative in a similar 'Indiana Jonesy' way what with the mentioning of the alternative world (our world) and the giving of the compass to Lyra and yet it totally ignores its roots from here on. This film basically turns into a recruitment process with Kidman's and Craig's characters hovering around in the background although never creating a presence; this is Indiana Jones all right: for nine year olds but then there's the complicated narrative and the fact the three Indiana Jones films were for people of all ages anyway.What we are led to believe is that in this world, they haven't made the technological advancements like cars and aeroplanes (their cars resemble horse and carts without the horses and they fly around in blimps) and yet build vast utopias that still find room to house criminals of some description whose main aim is to 'cut' away the souls of children at the first mention of the word 'dust'  yes, it's that bizarre. Mangled in with this, the character of Iorek Byrnison (McKellan - who is a CGI Polar Bear hilariously resembling a down and out P.I. in a film noir when first introduced) is given a sub-plot involving him rediscovering his 'armour' (metaphor for masculinity) and from there, he develops into a really guilty example of a fatherly figure for Lyra after it's established she lost her father previously. Thrown in amongst all this tosh is a CGI fist-fight between two polar bears trying to prove who is 'king'.It is the right time to mention the cast: Nicole Kidman delivers an eerie and chilling rendition of Marisa Coulter; a person who knows people high up in whatever hierarchy the school has. She also seems to get nastier and nastier as the film progresses but some of her lines she's given do not aid her in her career: ""I'll find you, Lyra(!)"" Oh, how evil. But the biggest disappointment is Daniel Craig who's present for about three scenes and then vanishes  this'll be the easiest pay-cheque he'll ever pick up, unless they make a sequel. In short, avoid this film even if you are a fan of the genre and are looking for two hours of brain rest because it's not even good enough to be that.",The Golden Compass
40,filipemanuelneto,"Highly biased, it's a CGI show harshly critical to religion.",2,15 October 2017,"This is the adaptation of ""Northern Lights"", the first of a collection of fantasy books named ""His Dark Materials"" by Philip Pullman, a writer famous for having atheistic, anti-Christian and anti-religious thoughts that are very evident in the book. Chris Weitz (director/screenwriter) made a huge effort to moderate that, already anticipating criticism from religious audiences, but the truth it is very difficult to make a good and moderate movie from a book that is bad, extremist and that seems to have been written as a kind of ""childish doctrinal propaganda"", to educate children towards secularism and atheism... so I don't think it's surprising that boycotts and criticisms have happened anyway.The story takes place in a world where people's souls live outside their bodies, accompanying them in the form of animals called ""Daemons"". The similarity between this word and the term ""devil"", of clear anti-Christian connotation, shouldn't be coincidental. In this world there is an authority called ""Magisterium"", of dictatorial and totalitarian contours, which seeks to hide the existence of other worlds, other realities and truths that aren't convenient. The choice of a word in Latin for the name of this political-religious entity is an attack on the Roman Catholic Church, which is often accused of obscurantism and of not accepting some scientific and philosophical innovations. From this base, totally distorted by the personal opinions of the author of the book, a complex script is born, which the film isn't able to explain to the public. The film assumes (wrongly) that public knows the original books but, since this didn't happen to me, I felt enormous difficulty in understanding it, even having to do some research to understand everything.With regard to the cast, there are several stars here but not all had characters to match them. Daniel Craig, for example, only has some protagonism in the beginning of the film. Then he disappears, making only a few episodic appearances. However, his character is one of the most important and is still mentioned in the dialogues even if it does not matter to the actor, who had little work here. Ian McKellan is excellent at giving voice to the polar bear Iorek Byrnison and Nicole Kidman is elegant and pleasantly malicious, but also had no room to develop a great villain. Eva Green makes a small cameo, in that it only appears punctually, in another witch role. Dakota Blue Richards, a small child actress, is the big star. She does a good job, shows some ability but, of course, this will not be her ""magnum opus"" if she continues her career. The film has great visual effects, good CGI work and good sound effects that make everything reasonably digestible, but cannot erase the serious script errors and subliminally biased tale of the story. The soundtrack is totally forgettable, which is detrimental to a good fantasy film.Finally, there is only one more problem of this film, evident in its open end: there should have been a sequel to close the story, but the critics of the religious public, who even tried to boycott the film, and the very few box office results condemned at birth any follow-up initiative. Some people still talk about that, but the truth is that it's been ten years since the movie debuted, so I think it's more likely that this sequel will not happen any more. Perhaps this is a good thing, given the bias of the original material.",The Golden Compass
41,Rectangular_businessman,Not that bad,6,11 June 2010,"I must confess that I never read the trilogy of books written by Phillip Pullman, so I don't know if this movie makes justice to the original materialPersonally I liked it. I thought that it was a funny, interesting film, with a rich and inspiring mythology. Too bad that many parts of the story were muddled and hard to follow (Apparently, New Line make a lot of edits to the film in order to make this story less ""offensive"" in order to avoid the controversies and the criticism from the Christian groupsIt didn't work, they still hated the film) Still, It wasn't so bad as most of the reviews said(Actually, along with ""About a Boy"" it must be one of the best works of the director, Chris Weitz) True, it isn't at the same level of the Lord of the Rings trilogy of films, but it worked very well as a sophisticated fantasy film. Of course, it had a lot of clichés (How many times we have seen the story of the Chosen One that have to save the world?) but The Cliché Storm wasn't a problem for me.6/10",The Golden Compass
42,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"""Compass"" entertains but doesn't bring its world into vivid life",6,3 July 2009,"I read Philip Pullman's ""His Dark Materials"" trilogy, the first of which is ""The Golden Compass,"" some time ago and I greatly enjoyed them, but in attempting to make this series into the next ""Chronicles of Narnia"" or ""Harry Potter"" as far as young adult fantasy novels- turned-movies go, New Line Cinema brings us an average and uninspired adaptation.""The Golden Compass"" focuses on yet another orphaned child with a destiny to fulfill in Lyra (Dakota Blue Richards), only Lyra is a she. Pullman's world isn't so much a fantasy one but an alternative universe with some fantasy elements: namely flying witches, armored polar bears and magical objects like the golden compass itself, also known as an alethiometer -- a truth-telling device. In it, humans live with external souls that take the form of animals called daemons. They are governed by a body called the Magisterium and Lyra, the recent recipient of this alethiometer is about to go on a journey to the arctic circle to figure out what this evil entity is up to.It is a complex universe and that's the first problem with the film. The script is nearly all exposition, explaining things to us so that we have some sort of understanding of how this alternative world works. Immediately it strips the film of character development (there are too many characters to count anyway) and makes themes other than a young child's courage completely null. It was unwise to give full creative control -- script and direction -- to Chris Weitz, whose track record includes ""About a Boy"" and directing Chris Rock's ""Down to Earth."" Not exactly proof that he can helm a big-budget family-oriented fantasy film. Weitz doesn't destroy the film by any means, but it's lackluster -- there's no sense of the grand scope of the fantasy world and the direction is mostly story-oriented. The purpose of these kinds of movies is to enchant us. ""Compass"" drives us merely by a daunting curiosity to understand what it's all about. Maybe this is also the nature of the novel -- it's more philosophical and much less whimsical than ""Harry Potter."" Definitely more for young adults despite childish characters.A lot of the buzz surrounding the film has to do with Pullman's theme in the books -- one that seems to suggest anti-religious sentiment. Having not made that connection reading the books as a young adult, I definitely didn't puck up on that in this film. There's a sense of abuse of power and authority and adults telling children what's best for them -- and the use of the word ""heresy"" -- but overall this adaptation comes off more fantasy and less philosophical lecture.It's enjoyable fantasy -- well-paced and extremely nice to look at, specifically the polar bears who look spectacular in CG. Its casting is excellent with hot ticket item Daniel Craig playing Lord Asriel, Lyra's uncle, and an enchanting yet terrifying Nicole Kidman as untrustworthy Mrs. Coulter. Voice actors for the animals include great talents like Ian McKellen, Ian McShane and young British acting sensation Freddie Highmore. However, ""Compass"" doesn't evoke the feeling that you're watching something special or magical when its plot-oriented script would indicate it's trying to milk out the fantasy elements above all else. Weitz's directing conveys what's going on well enough, but he doesn't make any choices that stand out and bring this world to life in our imaginations.",The Golden Compass
43,funkyfry,Terrible movie,2,2 May 2008,"First of all I have to admit right off the bat, I haven't read the original book. My girlfriend is quite a big fan of the book and she tells me that it is not very much like this terrible, horrible movie. So maybe at some point I will still give it a read through. This movie though, I would never want to waste my time watching again. It's hard to even know where to begin. First of all, the movie would be a complete loss if Sam Elliott wasn't in it. Despite what the advertising campaign would have you believe, he's in a lot more of the movie than Daniel Craig is. I've heard about this guy Daniel Craig, and I was kind of interested to see what sort of actor he is. Unfortunately after this movie I still couldn't tell you, because he was absent from most of the film and his character didn't make any sense. First we're introduced to him as a potential target for government assassination, then he's missing from the movie for quite a while and shows up for a brief pointless action scene, and is mentioned again at the end when Kidman says something about having him arrested but we still don't actually see him there. He's supposed to be some kind of scientist, but also is like an action hero. Just one of the many things in this film that makes no sense.So much about this film seems arbitrary. It is one of the worst films I've seen since the Peter Jackson ""King Kong."" It even made ""Stardust"" look like a good fantasy movie. In my opinion, just the whole method for telling the story is messed up. We don't have a chance to really become acquainted with this world, we're just sort of thrown into it and given a cursory explanation of what these ""daemons"" are without ever really getting a sense of why they are so important to the characters. We're just told that if someone hurts the daemon, then the human is hurt also and vice a versa, and that the daemon is the person's ""soul."" Since I don't really know what the word ""soul"" means in this context, that's not very helpful. The guy who wrote this screenplay needs to read Tolkien's essay ""On Faerie Stories."" You cannot have the faerie/fantasy world without something more normal for the audience to hold onto. There needs to be some nominal figure that we can relate to in the fantasy universe. This little girl already knows too much about the world, so we're never properly introduced to it as we are for example when we're eased into Middle Earth by way of Hobbiton or into Narnia by way of a magic cupboard. Or the way Buttercup and Wesley started out in ""Princess Bride"" on a normal farm. Since there's no normal world, outside of the vaguely developed college she attends, there's no contrast to the faerie world and no feeling of discovery or fantasy. Look at any successful fantasy film and you will see that, but it's missing here.Can I just say a few things about the acting -- the kid actress was fine, but Nicole Kidman surprised me with how broad her performance was and how truly one-dimensional it seemed. I blame the writer-director for this, and for most of the other faults in the film as well. This film basically lacks focus. There's a thousand elements going on at the same time but there's no strong central story. The scenes with the polar bears were horrible. The animation isn't any better than what we saw in 100 Coke commercial with the polar bears, and they fail to inspire any kind of wonder or enchantment. Here I can talk about the film's other essential weakness -- there's no idea to anything. We just have all these action scenes but there's no ""moment"" in them. Nobody uses their heads, there's no thought going on. The one polar bear who's the heroine's friend doesn't use his smarts to win the battle. It has all the intelligence of a WWF match, they just have the bad polar bear win for a while and then the good polar bear gets mad and beats him up. Likewise in the big final battle scene, there's no idea at all. It's just a bunch of people running around killing each other. The good guys arrive one at a time so that we're supposed to get that excited feeling ""the cavalry has arrived!"". Except there's no rhyme or reason to any of it, they just come on one at a time like a video game. And the villains -- just a bunch of anonymous dorks in tall hats. It was the lamest climactic battle I've seen since ""Return of the Jedi"" with the stormtroopers fighting the ewoks. And even in that film, at least the Ewoks used their imagination and intelligence to beat the stormtroopers, who by that time in the series seemed a pathetic foe anyway. These heroes just shoot at the bad guys until they're all dead. It's a really pathetic action scene, like the rest of the film it displays no imagination and no intelligence. Audiences today do often accept movies as bad as this one, but at the very least they need some kind of concept the audience can grab onto. This film was not successful for good reasons, and at least its failure restored some measure of my faith in the wisdom of the average film-goer.",The Golden Compass
44,jzappa,"A Safe, Sugar-Coated Cash-In",7,18 April 2008,"I'll say based on my hazy yet recent theater viewing of The Golden Compass that he concept of the animal tag-alongs of each character being metaphors for their personalities is fascinating, really. It's almost an appreciative nod to mystic personologies like astrology or tarot cards, while it attempts to give the audience much-needed vindication of organized religion by shading the story with allegories that make very unflattering sense. It's a shame that the film holds nothing else with anything remotely as impactful. I love the showdown between the two polar bears, but all the points of interest in the movie can be found in the original novel.I will admit that I have never read Pullman's book, but all of the people I went to see this film with have, and another friend who didn't see the movie with us explained the whole novel and compared it to my explanation of the whole movie. I can't give any solid opinions, though I do intend to read the whole trilogy, but I can say that based on what enthusiasts of the novel have said that it's a safe, sugar-coated cash-in. Shamefully.Chris Weitz once again does the exact opposite with film-making of what should ideally be done. What he does, with the exception of About a Boy, is send the wrong impressions to his audience, and his audience, and his audience is consistently the most impressionable age groups, high school kids who love movies like American Pie, and pre-teens that love movies like The Golden Compass, as well as American Pie. With American Pie, he visibly had an effect on the way we thought of sex at that age, setting the unspoken standard of perfect, fantasy- like sexual experiences that must be accomplished as soon as possible. With The Golden Compass, he forfeits the intentions of a faithful adaptation of a very popular novel for the sake of the less honest softened route that contradict the intentions of the undertones and symbolisms in Pullman's story. What he should be doing with movies with subject matter speaking to young people is be honest about it. (Superbad was a comedy about the teenage desperation to lose one's virginity that proved that American Pie could've been very funny by being honest.) Some directors don't often or ever do that but Weitz directly negates it.",The Golden Compass
45,Vartiainen,Two kilos of flour in a half kilo bag,5,11 September 2019,"The Golden Compass is a film adaptation of Philip Pullman's novel Northern Lights, which is the first part in his His Dark Materials trilogy. It is the story of Lyra (Dakota Blue Richards), a young girl living in Jordan College in Oxford. Her world is similar to ours, but its technology has grown along a different path and the souls of its inhabitants live alongside them as animal-like beings know as the daemons.Northern Lights is a good book. Its tone leans toward dark and moody, while its world mixes elements of dark fantasy, science fiction and steampunk. I have to admit that the trilogy as a whole gets very weird and is not particular to my liking, but the first book was very good. It's an odd collection of tropes that really shouldn't work very well together - for example, a steampunk cowboy airship pilot from Texas is the friend of a dethroned armoured polar bear berserker - but somehow they come together and form a large, inhabited world where everything seems to be possible.Unfortunately this diversity works against the story as a movie. There's too much to go over, too much to explain, which means that most of it goes unexplained or is just briefly glanced over. Which means that the film has many a moment where the uninitiated will no doubt let out a very big ""Huh?"", not getting the subtext or why that particular something meant anything.For example, in the book it is explained that it is a very big social taboo to touch another person's daemon. In the movie this isn't brought up, until suddenly it is a plot point. Which means that the plot point doesn't really work.The film also shuffles some events around, having them appear in different order than in the book. Most of the changes are bearable, but they don't really improve upon the source material so I don't see why they were necessary.The ending is also different. Or more accurately it cuts off sooner than the book. I can see why they wanted to do it this way as the ending in the book is more than a downer, but it still feels like studio hijinks.Still, the film is well-acted, has some nice CGI (especially for its time) and the world is interesting, even if it's not portrayed to its full potential. I can't really recommend it, but if you're a diehard His Dark Materials fan, the film might be worth a watch.",The Golden Compass
46,FiendishDramaturgy,Beautiful!,9,12 December 2007,"As with any other film adaptation from the literary world, this attempt does leave quite a bit to the fans of the book. However, what of the story is told, is told WELL! Changed and altered to suit contractual screen time obligations, etc., but still well told. The characters lack development, but if you're familiar with the series, they receive more development in the second installment, and this first installment was meant as nothing more than an introduction to the real meat of the story, which (hopefully) movie-goers will receive with the second and third chapters of this WONDERFUL tale.This is superior in production quality, acting quality (especially on behalf of the child actors), and content, to many other popular children's series of late, although this is NOT for the smaller children. It's far too brutal and graphic in a place or two.All in all? I can understand why organized religion would have a problem with this, as it teaches children to think for themselves, and the church has been working at dumbing us down for the last 60 years! If you're trying to raise a free-thinker, TAKE THEM TO THIS MOVIE! and buy these three books for them to read! The movie will at least serve to generate more interest in Pullham's beautiful series.

47,BeneCumb,Nice fantasy family movie... Without too much violence,7,18 January 2013,"However, the plot is hectic, the 1st part is more promising (although lots of reasoning on sophisticated scientific topics) and thrilling, the 2nd is more filled with fights and explosions. The ending is sudden, presumably left open for a sequel - not carried out so far... The screenwriters are so fond of Nordic myths and nature, that many names resemble old Scandinavian ones, Svalbard is a real place in Norway etc. The only strange thing was using Samoyeds as ruthless captures and killers; in reality, it is a small and calm population (under 50,000 left) living very far from Nordics and Svalbard.The cast is great or good, Nicole Kidman, Dakota Blue Richards in particular; Daniel Craig could have been spent more time on screen. Of course, the biggest quality of this movie are visual effects which won both Academy Award and Oscar; however, development and use of them is often at the expense of profundity and smoothness. And contemporary authors using ancient or medieval motives tend to mix with recent elements; that is why I prefer e.g. The Hobbit and Alice In Wonderland to His Dark Materials and Harry Potter saga.",The Golden Compass
48,freemantle_uk,An excellent way to ruin an brilliant novel,2,16 March 2008,"Ever since the Lord of the Rings Trilogy Hollywood has been looking at epics to be release, especially looking towards fantasy novels. The Golden Compass was based on Northern Lights (which I thought was a better title), a part of the His Dark Materials Trilogy. The story itself is a fairly simple affair. Its starts with Lyra, the hero of the story, watching the attempted murder of her uncle. At the same time children across Britain getting kidnapped, including Lyra's best friend, Roger. This leads to Lyra's adventure up North and on the way she makes enemies in the name of Mrs. Coulter and the Gobbers, and friends with the Gyptain people and Iorek Byrnison, the exiled king of the Bears. The film changed too much from the book. The film doesn't start with the attempted murder of Lord Asreil. It misses out of a lot of key scenes and doesn't try to explain things to people who might not have read the books. Lyra meets Serafina Pekkala, the witch queen, too early in the film and you don't see her daemon at all. Finally it changes the order of events because in the book Lyra helps save the children from experiment at Bolvangar, before going to help Iorek Byrnison reclaim his throne. In the film it was the other way room and I think that is just criminal. The book was also more darker in tone to the film. In the book children do die and suffer, but this isn't shown in the film. I also pictured the world differently; I pictured Jordan College as a more darker, Gothic building, and the world the book was set in was a late Victorian/early Edwardian period, not the modern world in the film. I also thought Lee Scoresby should have been played by a younger actor, Sam Elliot is good, but it really should have been some their late 30s, early 40s. Lyra also should have had straight blonde, not curly brown hair. They are some good points. They is some good action, especially the fight between the bears. They is a good cast and was well acted. Unforuately this wasn't enough to save the film.",The Golden Compass
49,dfranzen70,"Sudden ending doesn't offset imaginative, complex tale",8,4 May 2008,"Although it didn’t do particularly well in U.S. theaters, thus imperiling sequels, I found The Golden Compass to be highly entertaining and imaginative; it represents all the reasons I watch movies in the first place. It’s fast paced, managing to pack in hundreds of pages of narrative into about 110 minutes of movie. On the downside, the movie ends a bit earlier than perhaps it should have (i.e., not at the same point as the end of the book on which it’s based), leaving the viewer wanting more.The movie (based on the Phillip Pullman book) is set in a sort of alternative universe, one in which humans’ souls exist outside their bodies, manifest as animals. Before adulthood, these souls, called daemons, can take any number of forms (kitty cat, ferret, tiger, bug, bird), but once the human experiences Changes in the Body, the daemon settles into one form. Also, although the time and place seem to be comparative with 18th century Britain, there are technological advances that would seem out of place in our universe, such as jet-fueled zeppelins and flying boats and whatnot.Lyra Belacqua (Dakota Blue Richards) is a young girl attending a private school within the prestigious Jordan College. She’s an impish mischief maker, but she also has some nobility within her, earning an unspoken respect from her peers. At any rate, Lyra, through her uncle Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig) learns of the existence of Dust, a particular matter that her uncle believes helps determine the psychological makeup of all humans, by way of their daemons. Ah, but this goes against the teachings of the church, aka the Magisterium, which states that all rights and will derive from the Authority, aka God. (Yes, this is an antireligion book.) Asriel heads north to research Dust further; Lyra’s left behind but soon finds a new ally: Mrs. Coulter (Nicole Kidman), a “friend” of the college, who is also heading north and wishes Lyra to accompany her. But is Mrs. Coulter as perfectly awesome as she seems? Lyra’s not completely without resources, though. The Master of Jordan gave her an alethiometer, a curious device that allows the holder to learn Truth about something, provided he or she can read it correctly. This would be the Golden Compass of the title; it’s not really a compass, although it’s kind of goldish. At any rate, there are only a handful of these things left in the world, and very, very few people possess the skills to interpret their symbol combinations. It’s the sort of thing that takes decades for people to master, so of course Lyra learns she has the innate ability to read the alethiometer. Meanwhile, kids are disappearing; the rumor is that they are being taken to the north country, up where the armored (yes, really) bears live. Lyra encounters bears and witches and gypsy pirates (known as gyptians) and a cowboy named Lee Scoresby (Sam Elliott).And so ends my verbose plot description. So you can see how much plot’s being thrown in there, but here’s the cool thing - it all flows very smoothly; you don’t have to stop and wonder why people are doing what they’re doing, why these two are fighting, and so on. The exposition, so crucial to the story, is gently eased in; you hardly even know it’s there. Which is great, because who wants a movie that gets all thinky on you? If Harry Potter and Narnia aren’t your cup of tea, you’ll dislike this movie, but for me it a great feel-good movie. First, you’re able to identify with Lyra, even if you’re NOT a twelve-year-old girl. Second, the movie is wholly creative and inventive, creating an alternately beautiful and terrifying world that seems as real as our own. And third, the movie is exceptionally well cast, particularly Ian McKellen as Iorek Byrnison and Eva Green as Seraphina Pekkala. Oh, and Kidman and Craig are equal to the task.It’s not known at this point whether a sequel (The Subtle Knife is the second book) will be made, owing to a perceived lack of interest at the box office, but if there’s any flaw in the movie it’s in the ending. Now, I’m certainly not going to spoil the ending here, but I will point out that the movie ends at a different point than the first book ends, and it’s not necessarily a good stopping point. Apparently the makers of the movie needed a “happy” ending; the book’s ending is a bit more downbeat. Hopeful, perhaps, but definitely not a crowd pleaser. Still, the movie ended abruptly for me, since I’d read the books, and I was left feeling a little unsatisfied (and dissatisfied).",The Golden Compass
50,ianlouisiana,Literally fabulous.A tale of mystery and imagination.Wonderful.,10,5 March 2012,"At the time I saw ""The Golden Compass"" I had never read Mr Pullman's novels.I was captivated by the film and headed straight to my local library.In my opinion,the first chapter of ""Northern Lights"" on which the film is based,is the subtlest and cleverest introduction to a slightly askew world since Michael Moorcock.The film itself is excellent with first - class production values,excellent C.G.I. and fine performances. I had absolutely no idea of what it was about beforehand and thus approached it with an unbiased eye. It's clear it shares a committed viewing public who are devoted to the ""Harry Potter"" cash cow,""Lord of the rings"",""The chronicles of Naarnia"" etc and who possibly spend a lot more time than I do shut in their rooms with their computers contemplating the unfairness of life. Well,fine,that's their right of course and I'm the last person to deny them that right.But it surely must make it harder for them to write objectively about ""The Golden Compass"",which is frequently compared with the other fantasy films and found wanting in most departments. But let's take a step back and from the start and accept that a movie is different from a novel. We are moving from the field of the reader's imagination to the film maker's imagination and this is where the core problem is. The film diverges at many points from the novel - that certainly appears to be a common complaint - but that is the producers' privilege,and they pay handsomely for it. What you get on the screen is Mr Weitz's vision of ""The Golden Compass"" which obviously does not please many of the readers of Mr Pullman's novel.But is it fair to judge the film simply by that criterion?I think not. Approaching it as an outsider,as it were,I though it was moving and funny,sharp and effective. Of all the witches and wizards films I have seen,""The Golden Compass"" is the only one I would recommend to grown - up people who never went to public school,never wanted to go to public school and who find the stories an academic wrote for children a bit of a pain in the a****.",The Golden Compass
51,ackstasis,"""I will serve you in your campaign until I am dead, or until you have a victory.""",7,26 December 2007,"'The Golden Compass (2007)' was based upon the first novel {'Northern Lights,' published as 'The Golden Compass' in North America} of Philip Pullman's ""His Dark Materials"" fantasy trilogy, which, as I understand it, has proved quite successful in the last decade or so, though I haven't read it, and, indeed, had never previously heard of it. Produced by New Line Cinema, the film was green-lighted following the astonishing success of Peter Jackson's 'The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001)' and, with a reported budget of $180 million, it is one of the studio's most extravagant investments. Though any comparisons with a certain Tolkien trilogy will deem 'The Golden Compass' to be sorely lacking, the film is definitely one of the finer fantasy offerings to come our way this decade, sitting alongside Andrew Adamson's 'The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (2005)' as a quality children's adventure  even though, from a religious standpoint, the films are polar opposites.The entire tale unfolds in a parallel Universe, very much like our own, but different in a few crucial details. Most importantly is the embodiment of a person's soul: whereas the soul remains within the body in our world, in the universe of the 'Golden Compass,' it manifests itself into the form of an animal, known as a dæmon, which follows alongside us always. While we are young, this dæmon has the uncanny ability to shape-shift  perhaps into a weasel, a cat, a bird or a moth  until it finally settles upon a concrete form as its accompanying person matures. The world is ruled by the Magisterium, a totalitarian organisation that has dominated society for centuries, and, in its attempts to demand respect and obedience from all citizens, has slowly fallen into the depths of corruption. Above all else, the Magisterium fears the possibility of the existence of Dust, a particle that is believed to link parallel Universes, and so it invests all its efforts into destroying any evidence that may contradict hundreds of years of official doctrine.Into this tale comes a young orphan girl, Lyra Belacqua (Dakota Blue Richards), precocious, courageous and dismissive of authority. After her good friend (Ben Walker) is kidnapped by ""Gobblers,"" a group of sinister men who routinely snatch children with unclear motives, Lyra upholds her promise to rescue him, and, with the aid of her friends and allies, sets off towards the North Pole, realm of the Armoured Ice Bears, the ""panserbjørne."" Into Lyra's care is placed the final remaining alethiometer, a ""golden compass"" that will tell the complete truth to any question that a worthy person asks of it. Despite being overshadowed by a cast of more experienced actors, young Dakota Blue Richards does a very good job of carrying the film forward; occasionally, the boundless courage of her character begins to push credibility, but we can only expect her performances to improve. Lyra's young dæmons, Pantalaimon (voiced by Freddie Highmore), is a shape-shifting weasel, and some of pair's affectionate exchanges prove surprisingly touching.What makes 'The Golden Compass' such an enjoyable adventure is the selection of diverse and colourful characters: Nicole Kidman is exceedingly creepy as the icy Marisa Coulter, Sam Elliott is a lot of fun as a kind-hearted Texan aeronaut, Daniel Craig's Lord Asriel is the film's most charismatic and interesting character {so it's unfortunate that he's afforded precious little screen-time} and even CGI-created Iorek Byrnison the Armoured Bear {his voice naggingly familiar  I should have picked out Ian ""Gandalf"" McKellan anywhere!} gives a genuinely affectionate performance. Oh, yes, and I think that I also spotted Christopher Lee in one scene, though I would have liked for such an excellent character actor to have played a more prominent role.Though the visual effects in the film do tend to overshadow the story on more than one occasion, the effects themselves are really done quite well, and offer a veritable feast for the eyes. I wouldn't have thought that a one-on-one duel between two computer-generated polar bears could possibly be so thrilling, and yet I was completely glued to the screen; the audience at my cinema showing really got into this particular scene. Another effect that I also thought worked very well was how death was depicted on screen; as each person crumbled from a bullet or an arrow, their dæmons would simultaneously explode into a cloud of yellow dust. The film was shot mostly in the United Kingdom {with some sequences also filmed in Norway and Switzerland, apparently} and Henry Braham's cinematography does a top job of capturing the beauty of the British landscape.Prior to the release of 'The Golden Compass,' several religious lobbyist groups created a degree of controversy, calling for a boycott of the film, citing the source material's obvious anti-Catholic and atheistic themes. Though I did, indeed, notice some evidence of these claims  the Magisterium is quite obviously an allusion to the Church, along with their unwillingness to acknowledge new scientific discoveries if it contradicts ancient teachings  but, from what I've heard, most of the anti-religious stance was intentionally diluted from the film in order to obtain a wider commercial appeal. Frankly, there's no reason why young Christian children should not be taken to see this film, since they'll merely appreciate it for being an exciting fantastical adventure, and parents will, at the very least, be given something to think about. While Chris Weitz's 'The Golden Compass' is not among the greatest releases of 2007, there's no denying that I finished the film thirsty for more. I only hope that the two planned sequels are produced in the near future, because I just hate being left hanging!",The Golden Compass
52,GiraffeDoor,At least it's better than the book.,7,1 August 2019,Far better paced and less obnoxious than the novel with Lyra much more memorable.The issue is that it tries to cram six books worth of world building into just one movie.It looks amazing of course though it fails to really convey a real sense of grandiosity or significance in its plot which is too convoluted with inner mechanics and things that are hurriedly and crudely explained.Another watchable but forgettable children's novel adaptation.,The Golden Compass
53,alindsay-al,A Poor Attempt At A Start OF A Franchise,3,3 November 2019,"With His Darkest Materials upon us I felt it was time to rewatch the first attempt at getting this franchise off the ground The Golden Compass. The premise of the film sees a young girl who has a special device go on a journey to save a group of children. The main girl Lyra isn't the most interesting character ever portrayed, the actress tries her best but her inexperience is clear to see in this film and as mentioned her character doesn't exactly have the best material to work with. The supporting cast is really large and star studded but it doesn't overly impress, Sir Ian Mckellen voices Lyra's polar bear protector in the film and I really liked his character and I felt he got the most development in the film and was an actual interesting character. Sam Elliot is in this film and he is just really cool, he just has that cool charismatic charm about him that makes him a fun part of this film. Nicole Kidman is in this film but she is super boring in this film, she could have played by anybody and her character has nothing intersting about her and her motivations are not really very clear at all. Daniel Craig and Eva Green are in this film but their roles are so small that again anybody could have been in these roles and they weren't given the time to flesh out their characters. The story is absolutley all over the place, characters motivations aren't really explained and there are so many different things going on that it's hard to care about much in the film. Also the film ends really abruptly in a clear attempt to set up a sequel that never came. The script is so lacklustre and dull, neither the drama or humour is effective, you won't find the film funny or particularly compelling at all. The style has some interesting visual effects and I like some of the world building in the film, but the film is so fast paced and short in length that you don't really learn a thing about the universe to keep you intrigued. Overall this is a really poor film that feels like setup for sequels that we will never get, hopefully with His Dark Materials being a series it will allow the show to take its time and build an interesting universe.",The Golden Compass
54,sauravjoshi85,Disappointing movie riding on good acting,4,26 March 2019,"This movie is based on the novel Northern Light by Philip Pullman's trilogy and stars an ensemble cast of Nicole Kidman, Daniel Craig, Dakota Blue Richards, Sam Elliott and Eva Green. Acting is good and Daniel Craig could've been utilised better. Direction is bad and screenplay is irritating. VFX is great. The movie could have been made much better",The Golden Compass
55,barnabyrudge,"Visually pleasing adaptation of a highly-regarded children's book, rather lacking in emotional engagement.",5,11 December 2008,"The folks at New Line Cinema, fresh from the success of the Lord Of The Rings trilogy, bring another popular fantasy novel to the screen. This time the Phillip Pullman book Northern Lights  first of the ""His Dark Materials"" series. Given a new title  The Golden Compass  the film is a lavishly produced, expensive-looking, starrily-cast adventure romp which misses one vital ingredient. a heart. It has everything you'd think it would need, but never truly grabs you on an emotional level.There are many parallel universes, each subtly different from another, and we live in one of them. There exists another parallel continuum where the land is ruled by a large organisation known as the Magisterium, and people are shadowed everywhere by daemons (animal-like representations of their own souls). It is in this universe where The Golden Compass is set. Lyra Belaqua (Dakota Blue Richards), a young girl living in the grounds of Jordan College, Oxford, overhears her adventurer uncle Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig) preparing for an expedition to the Arctic. Asriel hopes to find a powerful dust which could help people to move between the various parallel universes. Around the same time, children keep disappearing and their abductions are blamed on a mysterious group known merely as the ""Gobblers"". When Lyra's best friend Roger (Ben Walker) is taken by the Gobblers, she vows to save him. Lyra discovers that a friend of the college, the wealthy and seemingly charming Mrs Coulter (Nicole Kidman), is actually in charge of the Gobblers. The children she takes have been imprisoned in a desolate Arctic prison where they are being reconditioned as part of a sinister experiment conducted by the Magisterium. Lyra embarks on a wild rescue mission in the far north, where she befriends the likes of American adventurer Lee Scoresby (Sam Elliott) and an armoured bear named Iorek Byrnison (voiced by Ian McKellen). She is also secretly entrusted with the last alethiometer, or golden compass, an incredible piece of equipment which only Lyra can read and which tells her the truth about all manner of dark secrets.There's real potential here. The story is extremely imaginative, but too much of the cleverness that has earned the book its devoted army of admirers doesn't transmit easily into the film. Writer director Chris Weitz has given it a good go but fallen agonisingly short. The special effects are quite impressive in most scenes, though the climactic battle of the bears isn't quite as real-looking as one might hope it to have been. In terms of sets, costumes and cinematography the film is most elegantly presented, but for all the lavishness and elegance it just never clicks into gear as an involving human story. Most of the performances are decent enough, though certain characters aren't fleshed out much (presumably there'll be more to discover if any of the proposed sequels ever make it to the screen). The film  like part one and two of the Lord Of The Rings trilogy  finishes with many loose ends hanging in the air, with the result that there's something frustratingly incomplete about it (a flaw the LOTR trilogy managed to skillfully avoid).",The Golden Compass
56,NateWatchesCoolMovies,A waste of the brilliant source material,3,15 December 2016,"There's a reason they never adapted another novel in Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials series past the initial stab at The Golden Compass, and it's the same infuriating reason why many adaptations of children's and young adult novels fail: lack of appropriate atmosphere and true menace found in the source material. Every time Hollywood comes along and decides to try their luck at a beloved series for youngsters or young adults, they feel this feverish need to shine it up with a candy colored, over lit vibe that leaves much of the darker elements by the wayside and as a result their final product feels neutered and bereft of any weight, stakes or attention to detail. Spiderwick. Skellig. Eragon. Hell, even Narnia only made it by the skin of its teeth, blasting out of the gate with a flawless entry, only to peter off into sequels afflicted by the very symptoms I outlined above, and not even make it to the end of the saga at that. Now don't get me wrong, this doesn't happen to every series they try to adapt, but to enough of them that it's a problem, especially when a darkly creative, eerie and unique tale like this gets turned into a glossy, pandering misfire. It's sad because some of the elements of a good film are in place, starting with casting. Dakota Blue Richards is on-the-nose perfect as Lyra, the adventurous heroine who gets swept away on a menacing voyage to arctic lands and beyond. She lives in a curious parallel universe where every human is forever accompanied by a 'Daemon', essentially a piece of their soul that takes animal form, and never the two shall separate. Lyra's uncle Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig) is an explorer who has returned from the north lands with tales of a mysterious phenomenon called 'dust', a powerful substance purported to be able to unlock other worlds and dimensions. Lyra is curious at first and then nervous when she meets icy Mrs. Coulter (Nicole Kidman) a prim socialite with a devious agenda involving children that have gone missing in the city. She has a facility on the tundra where scary research and very bad experiments are conducted. Now in the books the descriptions and eventual confrontation with this would make your hair turn white. Pullman imparts it with weight and true blood freezing horror. The filmmakers *deliberatly* tone it down and castrate it, leaving anyone who was a fan of the series in total disgust. It just doesn't have the same dark, otherworldly atmosphere it did on the pages, it feels too bright, chipper and lacking any real wonder. It does have some wicked visuals going for it in places, such as the two rival talking bears, voiced with baritone boom by Ian McKellen and Ian McShane, the landscape of the north as seen from the hot air balloon of grizzled sky-cowboy Lee Scoresby (Sam Elliott), and others. Eva Green also scores well as elemental witch Serafina Pekkala, but then she's incapable of giving a bad performance anyhow. Scattered supporting cast includes Kathy Bates, Kristin Scott Thomas, Tom Courtney, Simon Mcburney, Derek Jacobi, as well, an impressive lineup all in all, but one that deserves a far better film for their talent. It's just misguided and tone deaf. It may have been a series for adolescents, but the themes, implications and scenarios found in those books are harrowing, complex, very mature and not to be taken lightly, let alone given the full on Harry Potter theme park treatment. Shame, really, and a giant missed opportunity. Perhaps someday soon a network will get the rights and turn this tale into a film or TV show worthy of His Dark Materials.",The Golden Compass
57,davispittman,Weak film,3,10 January 2016,"The Golden Compass is definitely a weak movie adaptation. The special effects and the visuals are great, I loved the visuals! But that seems to be all the film cares about, it doesn't seem like they cared about a good plot, good writing, or good dialogue. I felt like Daniel Craig was kinda out of place in this movie, I didn't really think he was the correct choice for his role. Although I did think that Nicole Kidman was good in her role, I enjoyed her as mrs coulter. The main child actress was pretty good in her role, sweet and innocent. I will say this, the Oscar win was well deserved for the special effects. But unfortunately that's the only good think about the golden compass, that and Nicole Kidman. Other than that, there's just nothing special or good about this movie. And the ending was a huge cliffhanger and a wtf kinda moment.

Some very elaborate and clearly expensive scenes ( eg: the restaurant) are trimmed to just seconds, frustrating the adult viewer who wants to see the story and the production properly. Over all with more than a touch of the Verne-Narnia- Potter- Rings imagery, and with Nicole as Grace Kelly's bad sister and a lost James Bond having a shave and leaving for another film, THE GOLDEN COMPASS ultimately feels like we have been pelted with the Readers Digest condensed version of 4 other films, including the one we are supposed to be seeing. I also found the names of places and people complicated to follow as it was all in a babbled rush. But what is there is certainly spectacular and well produced and well acted. I suppose there will be a 99 set DVD collectors edition because of the amount of material clearly shot and mercilessly trimmed. ... and a sequel apparently is likely. ... or unlikely as this first film might not quite make it's budget.... which is disappointing.

60,aharmas,Golden Fantasy,9,5 January 2016,"I originally saw this film seven years ago, and I liked it, but there was something that bothered me about it, as if they had left stuff behind. What can one expect since it is almost impossible to include everything from the novel? So I decided to read it and found out they had done a decent job. Maybe I was just a bit disappointed that we didn't get enough, and eventually I was really upset when the rest of the trilogy wasn't going to be made.The first of the books is indeed a great introduction to the world of daemons, dust, and the golden compass. What's that mysterious object? Why does it only reveal the truth to a chosen few? What is that prophecy? We surely can just say that everything is an allegory for society and religion, though there are allusions to patterns, and we can say that the compass is not just an indicator of human choices and symbols, like a set of playing cards has ties to the Tarot and its mysticism.What we have is an adventure that is pretty exciting, and it benefits immensely from having very likable leads. Kidman is wonderful as the evil Coulter, and Elliot lends much integrity to his flying cowboy. I really liked Eva Green as the witch Sarafina. It is a bit frustrating because there are so many characters and not enough time devoted to them.The book, like the movie, doesn't give you enough to explain what is happening. It is an introduction of settings, situations, and characters, some with fascinating backgrounds that are given enough time to fit in a trailer but not in a film of this caliber. What we get is one of the most beautiful displays of art direction and CGI, with the promise that things will become really exciting if we are willing to wait. There's no closure to this chapter. We are left waiting, and sadly enough, that's what happened to the people who saw the movie. Yes, you can go and read the last two installments, but it would have nice to see the entire production, but even if they went back, the wonderful cast wouldn't be able to be a part of the film. It would have to start all over, and that would really be a pity.",The Golden Compass

I haven't and i'm not going to read the books so i really don't know what to expect about this film but truly it was the most promising in yesterday's films in the commercial theaters. And i enjoy it a lot in some great parts but there are very slow parts in the beginning, specially when Nicole Kidman's character appears, that are very boring but anyway the film in general aspects works. I mean the story is very good involving parallel universes and some great characters and of course great creatures like those amazing bears. And the visual part of the film is just excellent, specially the fight between the bears. So in that way the film is excellent.And the cast, well is just good, i mean the three ""big names"" (Nicole Kidman, Daniel Craig and Christopher Lee) appears in few parts and the other ""big name"" (Ian Mckellen) is just the voice of one of the bears. The main role of Lyra is really good and Dakota Blue Richards is also good. So i can say that the best things in this film are the story and the visual part of it.Conclusion: this film is good, with a very boring beginning but with an excellent climax that ends in nothing. The principal audience of this film, the kids, will be in love with the visual part but the story is difficult for a little kid, so i think they wont enjoy the story and they can easily get bored (In Mexico the certification for this film is ""A"", for everyone).

And boy, did it earn it.How in the world can a movie featuring talking, FIGHTING polar bears, be this dull? The only bit of mild interest came in the beginning, as I was learning about the world and its mythology. After that, it was just a parade of one uninspired and completely predictable scene after another. I'm not asking for some revelatory cinematic experience, but The Golden Compass felt like a movie a that I had already seen fifty times before, and never particularly liked in the first place. None of the CGI or special effects were particularly eye-catching, and at times I thought that the armoured bears looked almost bad. I wouldn't be surprised if most of the effects budget was spent on the swirling golden Dust that seemed to pop up every few minutes.The majority of the actors seemed completely miscast or incapable. Daniel Craig was OK for the five minutes he was in the film, but to say that Nicole Kidman (who I usually have a strong inclination to like) was on autopilot would be an understatement. The kid they have playing Lyra was decent in some scenes, and completely lost in others. Eva Green was wasted on a throwaway character (though I assume she would have been focused on more in subsequent movies). The rest were a total disaster of odd, cliché, or ridiculous.This was the perfect example of how NOT to do a book adaptation. Either The Golden Compass was utterly unsuited to film, or the book was placed in the hands of people who had little idea of what to do with it. I'm leaning towards the latter.",The Golden Compass

Could one-third of the story stand on it's own? A very good-looking film with great casting but terrible story-telling. Like ""Dune"" an attempt to compress the story made it impossible to follow. In an alternate universe, symbiotic magical shape-shifting animal ""Daemons"" act as guides and guardians to protect the feelings and souls of their lifetime human companions. There are evil ""witches"" (Nicole Kidman) and saviors. A council that strips little children of their ""soul companions"" to enslave them. A very complicated plot that tries to explain it all and fails. The ""Golden Compass"" is a special ""magnetic"" device that always points toward the Truth and the Right Way. It comes into the possession of a special child that uses it for good only, while the ruling Council of Magicians wants to control it and either destroy it or use it for their own dark purposes. Spellbinding at first with extraordinarily well-done CGI, it soon deteriorates into a jumbled mess by the end of the film. Epic battles similar to everything from ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" to The ""Lord of the Rings"" to ""Harry Potter"". It should have been re-edited with a more satisfying ending but instead it strongly hinted of an immediate sequel that was never made. (Originally planned as three films.)

The premise of talking animals does not seem to work as well here as in other films. Also, the epic battle climax is far too familiar and similar to other films of the same genre. I can only assume that the books are far better, as they were Scholastic best-sellers at the time. Even Sam Elliot can't save this one!",The Golden Compass
65,pyrocitor,Entertainment at the cost of profundity,7,10 December 2007,"Literary adaptations are always a testy business, with filmmakers consistently trying to appease fans of the original work while still making sufficient changes to make the material work as a film. With this in mind, as well as the inevitable uproar from various religious sects, The Golden Compass, adapted from the first book in Philip Pullman's 'His Dark Materials' trilogy was hardly an easy sell, and by no means a sure bid for box office success. Despite all of the negative factors against it, the film, while not the timeless fantasy epic it would like to be, proves a decent adaptation of Pullman's work and a sufficiently entertaining piece of escapism to boot. Despite initial skepticism, director Chris Weitz of American Pie infamy demonstrates sufficient care and interest in his subject matter to bring the novel to life in a suitably quality fashion. Despite the occasional moment of flashy cinematography or special effects giving the impression of a child experimenting with his film-making toys, Weitz demonstrates a firm and steady grip on his film, keeping the tone light for a younger audience while retaining the occasional darker moment from the book to keep fans satisfied. Weitz's screenplay, while nowhere near as disappointing as it could have been, falls prey to the typical film fantasy pitfall of consistently struggling to force-feed as much information to the audience as possible as quickly and in as simplistic a fashion as possible, leading to a somewhat rushed narrative and an irritating lack of character development or exposition. Fans of the source material will likely grumble due to the occasional creative change, some more noticeable than others, while those unfamiliar with Pullman's books may be lost in a flurry of confusion, bombarded with a constant array of new names, faces and theoretical concepts. However, despite a disappointingly simplistic tone, the sheer enjoyment factor of the novel is not lost, and such is the film's primary strength: entertainment, if at the cost of profundity.The special effects are for the most part top notch - the shapeshifting daemon effects are impressively integrated, the armoured bear fight is without question the pure, unfiltered exhilarating spectacle of the year, and the final mass battle sequence is similarly thrilling. The film's sets, costumes and props are spellbinding, easily giving the viewer the sense of being immersed in an imaginative alternate world with all of the visual splendour befitting such a fantasy epic. However, the film's musical score is a painful rehash of far too many clichéd epic film scores of late - far too overdone to be in the least emotionally affecting. The stellar cast prove to be the film's high point, each inhabiting their roles with a comfort suggesting they had been born to play their respective parts. Newcomer Dakota Blue Richards is a revelation, surpassing the wooden efforts of most other child actors and carrying her lead role with ease, holding her own alongside her incredibly accomplished adult co-stars. Nicole Kidman is sheer perfection as the malevolent yet hypnotic Mrs. Coulter, effortlessly walking away with the show - every moment on screen, every glance, every movement is entirely in character, so fully does Kidman make the role her own. Daniel Craig proves a very fitting choice as scientific explorer Lord Asriel, making good use of his far too fleeting screen time, though one can't help but wish his character had a slight bit more of an edge to him.Sam Elliot gives his strongest performance in years, instilling sardonic aeronaut Lee Scoresby with an offbeat charisma and sly humour wonderfully fitting the role and Eva Green is an ethereal and captivating presence as mysterious witch Serafina Pekkala. The somberous tones of Ian McKellan prove ideal in breathing life and soul into armoured bear Iorek Byrnison, and young Freddie Highmore is well cast as the voice of Lyra's daemon, Pantalaimon. Derek Jacobi and Simon McBurney give strong, if one dimensional performances as heads of the ominous Magesterium organization, as does Christopher Lee, whose 'blink-and-you-miss- him' role appears to be nothing less than a blatant cash in on The Lord of the Rings, but who delivers his one line well at any rate. While fans of the novels may lament the watering down of the philosophical undertones of Pullman's novel, and the film being directed towards a younger audience, on the whole, despite the inescapable criticisms, as a sprawling piece of fantasy escapism, immersing the viewer in a world of armoured bears, daemons and witches, the film is a rousing success. It's just a shame to see such a strong premise fraught with such an overbearing air of caution and safety to please the lower common denominator, and one can't help but wish the producers had been slightly more daring, and captured a trace more of Pullman's nervy grit and spark to make the film a slightly less generic Hollywood blockbuster, and more satisfying overall. The film certainly isn't the 'next Lord of the Rings' which New Line certainly seems to intend for it to become, but an enjoyable and sufficiently impressive effort to warrant the next installment in the series, The Subtle Knife being made. -7.5/10",The Golden Compass
66,Sirus_the_Virus,Phillip Pullman can go to hell.,6,24 October 2009,"The Golden compass is a fantasy adventure that some will soon forget. I have many problems with this movie. The biggest problem I had with it was that Phillip Pullman, who wrote the story, goes out of his way to prove he is an atheist. Demons are supposedly good, Witchcraft is acceptable, and other bad things.I am not going to get into the plot. Just that Phillip Pullman is a sick man. On the whole, the movie isn't that bad just that it is kind of annoying and silly that Demons are good in this situation. The Golden compass is a mild thumbs down. The cast is good, the effects are good, the movie isn't that bad, but some of the contents in this movie are kind of irritating. The Golden compass:**1/2 out of ****",The Golden Compass
67,sarastro7,"Works really well, mostly",9,8 December 2007,"It seems that half the people hate this movie for being anti-Christian propaganda, and the other half hates it for not being enough like the books. I'm part of neither half. Now, I haven't read the books (but I intend to), but I know people who have, and I do understand that the movie is different, and I can see why this disappoints many of the fans.BUT, even with this understanding, I still think the movie worked really well on its own. Not knowing the books, I was mightily entertained, loving the world, the symbolism, the characters, the concepts and the effects. As fantasy movies go, I thought this was one of the best I've ever seen. Of course, I'm not a huge fantasy fan (I'm a die-hard sci-fi fan), and I don't really enjoy silly magic and childish story lines. But The Golden Compass didn't have those things. It comprised an interesting and attractive universe that made a lot of sense, with a storyline that didn't talk down to an adult audience but kept you asking questions about the salient points of the plot.So I liked it, and award it an 9 out of 10. Things that could have been better: There might have been a bit more suspense. A lot of the action was fairly predictable. But the one thing I felt didn't work terribly well was the daemons. The concept itself is cool, and I like the symbolism (the daemons being the humans' anchor to the Dust, i.e. to free will, creativity, curiosity and imagination), but I thought some of the execution was very messy. Why is there a taboo against touching someone else's daemon? Doesn't make sense. But the daemons can touch each other, even fight?! A person (like Mrs. Coulter) can be in conflict with her own daemon?! And how the heck can Lyra hide under a table (with no table-cloth) in a room full of people with daemons that run around on the floor? Too many questions and no clear answers. Well, maybe when I read the book...Anyway, I generally liked the film and I'm sorry that it seems to be doing less business than it would need to in order to spawn sequels (although this is of course still up in the air at the time of this writing). In fact, the movie should probably have played *up* the whole anti-religion thing, so it would have been really controversial and edgy. That would probably have served it better, and turned it into a cult movie if not a huge commercial success.9 out of 10.",The Golden Compass
68,jaredmobarak,Just a small little cutThe Golden Compass,7,10 December 2007,"I have thought that Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials Trilogy would make some very interesting films ever since I read them almost a decade ago. The fantasy and utter intrigue that they instilled in me never left my consciousness. When I heard that American Pie director Chris Weitz would be helming it, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. I've seen many movies in my time to know that past work means often little when it comes to future endeavors, but I admit to enjoying the Pie movies as well as loving his third film About a Boy. With a movie like The Golden Compass, it will generally come down to the special effects and story to decide how much of a success it will be. I credit the director for taking it upon himself to adapt the story and get some wonderful talent involved. It is just unfortunate that New Line was unable to put up the money to do the trilogy all together much like their last foray into magical worlds. I say this, not because this film failsI actually think it does quite well at telling the novel's storybut because we may never see another in the series made.Rarely does a movie open up with close to $30 million, $15 million more than second place at the box office, and be deemed a failure. The budget here is just too steep, and although it is gorgeous to view, that money was well spent, the recouping process may be too much to conquer for subsequent entries. As a result, the film just can't stand up by itself. Without even the misguided decision to hold off the dark end of the book, (although it has been filmed), in order to begin a hopeful second installment, this entry really doesn't go anywhere except for delivering exposition and character development. The novel sets up the world that is falling apart around our heroine Lyra in order for her to make the leap into parallel universes and find a way to save her people. As a result, we have two hours crammed with so many characters and so much backstory that it feels very daunting at times. I myself was fine with it, but I read the story previously. If you are unfamiliar with the tale, I can see frustration setting in quickly and never dissipating. It is a real shame because it was a good start that may never payoff with a finish.As a condensed adaptation, I have to give all involved a lot of credit. Everything that you need is included and it all makes sense. To a novice of this parallel earth, I would suggest a second viewing to comprehend it all, but it is in fact all there. Resulting from the almost Cliff Notes-like speed, there are many actors that receive very small screen allotments. Daniel Craig, as Lord Asriel, is virtually nonexistent except in spirit and name. By not keeping the end intact, the audience never gets the payoff as to what the man is truly capable and willing to do. This is too bad because the build up is sufficient to have created some real fireworks at the end, maybe even making those a tad lukewarm overall to anticipate what might happen next. Nicole Kidman is adequateI hate to beat a dead horse, but she just hasn't been the beauty or talent she was two years ago or more, and it really hurts my viewing of herbut almost too vague in her role. She is the orchestrator of what is happening with the Magisterium, but that whole subplot kind of takes a back seat to Lyra's joining of her ragtag group of warriors.A lot of the acting is superior in form, however. I think Eva Green is brilliant casting as the witch Serafina Pekkala, although her role is chopped to almost five total minutes on screen, and who could argue with the great voices of Ian McKellen and Ian McShane as the Ice Bears? It is Sam Elliott, though, that shows he still has the stuff to be successful. You don't see him much anymore, but his Scoresby is flawless. Last but not least is newcomer Dakota Blue Richards as our lead. For a first-timer, she is a joy, bringing to life the fearlessness and curiosity that allows her role to be as uniquely heroic as she is. I'd love to see what she does in the next two films.Rounding out the film as a whole are some nice special effectsthe Alethiometer is gorgeous, the disintegrating daemons upon their host's death into ""dust"" well-done, and the environments beautiful to behold. Also, I guess I couldn't really speak of the film without at least a mention of the controversy surrounding the author Pullman's atheism. I don't quite remember it when reading, but upon viewing here, it is kind of prevalent. Not atheism in general, but a mirroring of a church-like establishment trying to force its ideals on society for its own means. Heck, that is what the Catholic Church does whether you like it or not. Does that mean it teaches a belief that God does not exist? No. All it does is show that man is corruptible and sometimes it takes a strong being to set things right. That being here is young Lyra Belacqua, using technology sure, (for all you Darwinists out there), but also an inherent ability to read symbols and be a part of a long held prophecy. Despite that prophecy being held by witches (pagans maybe?) it is something that shows a higher form's existence. Let your children experience life and other ways of thinking; nothing here says God is dead, it just shows that beliefs can be individually manifested. Faith is a powerful thing that exists whether you are a member of an organization or not.",The Golden Compass

70,vip_ebriega,A gorgeous yet flawed fantasy adventure.,6,24 March 2009,"My Take: Only briefly controversial as its source, but it's nonetheless visually-stunning. I call it the anti-NARNIA. This, the first adaptation of Philip Pullman's controversial ""His Dark Materials"" trilogy, has all the advertisements boasts: marvelous CGI critters, visually-stunning vistas unlike anything we will ever see (well, until a new blockbuster that will boast the same thing) and cast that happens to include Nicole Kidman as a classy villainess and Daniel Craig not playing James Bond. THE GOLDEN COMPASS is also awaited for how the controversial material of the novels would translate to the screen. When it finally arrives, the film looks exactly like what they wanted it to look like. A visually-stunning fantasy that dazzles us with one marvelous wizardry after another. On the other hand, the controversy and the details of the novel are rushed and almost non-existent.Still, what I expected from THE GOLDEN COMPASS is there and I could never deny it. It only briefly ventures into controversy, the visuals are dazzling, magnificent and simply unforgettable. This is certainly a good-looking and well-made motion picture. But is it a good movie? Saying it's nowhere near as bold, vast and intriguing as the novel doesn't really answer the question. Instead, judging it as a movie (by someone who hasn't read any of Pullman's books, but still), this is finely-crafted piece of entertainment. It has competent heroes (and heroines) and intriguing villains, something even the rushed narrative can truly dent.Set on yet another distant fantasy world ruled by a theocracy called The Magesterium (does this dogmatic organization represent the Catholic Church? Who knows?) with talking animals referred to as ""Daemons"", which are people's souls taking the shape-shifting form of animals. And, just as we liked the four kids as heroes in the first NARNIA movie, THE GOLDEN COMPASS gives as a surprisingly more mature heroine named Lyra Belacqua, played by new comer Dakota Blue Richards, a tomboyish, rebellious little girl who is being educated at the Jordan College under the wing of her mentor and uncle Lord Asriel (Craig). While she is becomes of great interest to the mysterious Mrs. Coulter (Kidman, in an intriguing role) who asks her to tag along on her brigade, she is entrusted to hold a most interesting device called an Alethiometer (or in layman's term a Golden Compass), a compass which points to the truth. She uses this, along with a batch of allies including a Ice Bear (a giant polar bear) named Iorek Byrnison (this impressive CGI behemoth is voiced by Ian McKellen), to save kidnapped children who may have been abducted for a mysterious reason. And if this almost sounds like an atheistic metaphor on declining religion due to the abusive power of a fictional version of modern Catholic church, not even the most observant of viewers might detect it due to the near-refusal of the movie to venture on its controversial background.Though some of the narrative is rushed, leaving a lot of deeper details along the way, the movie still maintains an intriguing plot. However, the lack of any depth is evident. Lyra is a bold and resourceful heroine, but as played by newcomer Dakota Blue Richards, she won't be replacing Harry Potter or those kids from NARNIA. Perhaps the most interesting character is Kidman, who gives Mrs. Coulter's serpentine villainy some style. She looks good on those costumes too! The brilliant effects have been done before, but I can overlook that fact as long as they still dazzle and still offer me something I have never seen before. The decent (if somewhat pedestrian) score by Alexandre Desplat sets the mood of the story; it's graceful at best but somewhat redundant at worst. However, on a negative note, other talented players namely Eva Green and Christopher Lee are given very little credibility in thankless roles, while Sam Elliot is forced to give off another cowboy impression, almost not very different from the one he played in the awful GHOST RIDER. Famous faces including Kristen Scott-Thomas and Kathy Bates who provide their voices on some of the animated characters are rarely detectable. Only Freddie Highmore who provides the voice for Lyra's ""Daemon"" Pantalaimon and McKellen's Ice Bear are recognizable.Still, regardless of some of its failings and shortcomings, THE GOLDEN COMPASS is a visually-stunning and imaginatively designed fantasy adventure. If its lack of a real heart can be forgiven, the craft behind it is still undeniable.Rating: *** out of 5.",The Golden Compass
71,fwomp,A Compass With No Direction,3,6 May 2008,"I had high hopes for THE GOLDEN COMPASS. The cast. The special effects. The story. It promised to be a dazzling cinematic experience. But the dazzle fell into Dudsville as Philip Pullman's magical novel got off to horrible start.Before I get started, however, I think it's noteworthy to mention how ridiculous I found the claims surrounding the persecution of Christianity and The Church with regards to this film. You might be able to draw parallels between atheism and some of what was seen. But it could also represent Nazism. I know that Pullman WAS an atheist, but to say his books (and this film) represented that view is simply untrue. With the release of THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA, Christianity has nothing to fear. Which is also why this review is tough for me.I don't prescribe to any particular faith (you might even call me *gasp!* an atheist), but I don't go to movies in order to reinforce my beliefs. I go to be entertained. And, as I've said many times before, entertainment starts with a good (or great) script. And The Golden Compass' start was exceptionally unimpressive.Jumping around like a child with A-D-D, The Golden Compass lacked perspective and a unified focus. The story is SUPPOSED to focus on Lyra (Dakota Blue Richards), a young girl who's parentage is in question on a parallel world where ""beasts"" (see Animals) are part of ones being. They tag along beside you and are basically your soul (Oh my God! Christians Unite! *Whoops! There I go!*) Each person has a different animal/beast and young people's animals can change from one to another until they settle on a shape as they approach adulthood. Lyra's uncle Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig, CASINO ROYALE) is a scientist who goes against the grain of this parallel world and its leaders. He's found that ""dust"" from other worlds is flowing into theirs and he wants to discover what this dust is all about. But the powers that be want to stop him.Enter Marisa Coulter (Nicole Kidman, HAPPY FEET), a dangerous player within a government that seeks to control everything, including Lyra. Marisa fraudulently befriends Lyra and takes her on a trip North, but not before Lyra receives a magical golden compass from a high councilor at the school where her uncle worked. The compass, it is said, is the last of its kind and can tell the truth and possibly the future.Encounters with giant polar bears, flights in massive zeppelins, child prisons in the far-north, all culminate to form ... a disaster. And I don't mean a disaster for Lyra, but a disaster for the movie-watcher.The canvas is simply too broad to be a coherent whole. Multiple side stories are mentioned and then never seen again or quickly wrapped up with little-to-no understanding. The script obviously was very choppy; perhaps American PIE director Chris Weitz wasn't the best person to write it? The only upside to the film is the incredible special effects. Most of the scenes were pure ga-ga for the eyes. Which means that The Golden Compass is more fluff than substance. By contrast, The Chronicles of Narnia was exceptionally well put together with a few duds in the special effects arena. But Narnia held together extremely well, while The Golden Compass didn't have a direction.",The Golden Compass
72,jluis1984,A nice introduction to the series...,7,18 December 2007,"Ever since first published in 1995, ""Northern Lights"", the first novel in the ""His Dark Materials"" series by British writer Philip Pullman, became a very popular fantasy novel, not only among young readers, but also among the adult population, earning several prestigious literary awards around the world. However, the ""His Dark Materials"" series of books also became the subject of controversy among fundamentalist Christians, who see in the book an attack to their beliefs, and a propagandistic tool for atheism. Controversies aside, the popularity of the ""His Dark Materials"" series piqued the interest of New Line Cinema after the success of ""The Lord of the Rings"" in 2002, and now, 5 years later, a film adaptation of the first book in the series is now a reality, under the title of ""The Golden Compass"" (as it's known in America) and director Chris Weitz at the helm.""The Golden Compass"" is the story of Lyra Belaqua (Dakota Blue Richards), a young girl living at the University of Oxford, in a parallel universe to our own, similar but different, where life is ruled by the omnipresent organization known as the Magisterium, and the soul resides outside the body in the form of an animal called a ""dæmon"". One day, she hears her uncle Lord Asriel's (Daniel Craig) announcement to the College that he has discovered the existence of parallel worlds. This investigation goes against the Magisterium dogma, and immediately he is considered an heretic. Lord Asriel decides to travel to the north pole to continue his experiments, but when Lyra's best friend Roger (Ben Walker) is kidnapped by the mysterious Gobblers, she decides to go to the north too, beginning an adventure that will take her to meet armored bears, and discover a powerful secret.Adapted to the screen by director Chris Weitz himself, ""The Golden Compass"" is essentially, an introduction to the universe of ""His Dark Materials"" and the beginning of Lyra's heroic journey. However, fans of the book should not expect a direct adaptation of the novel, as Weitz took several noticeable liberties with the plot, some done in order to make the story cinematic, some done with the idea of toning down the religious allusions that Pullman uses in his novel. While with this changes Weitz certainly sacrificed substantial parts of the story, he still manages to make an interesting and intriguing plot, that certainly makes one to know more about this parallel world and its ultimately fate. As the focus is completely on Lyra, there isn't a lot of character development for most of the supporting characters, and that's something that brings the film down a bit.As he is better known for his work in comedies (""American Pie"" and ""About a Boy"" for example), it was hard to think of Chris Weitz as a director of Pullman's epic fantasy, however, in this aspect his work truly shines. While his script isn't really up to the expectations, his visual design and overall vision for the movie is simply flawless. With an excellent work of cinematography (by Henry Braham) and art design, Weitz makes Pullman's work come to life in a grandiose fashion, and gives every scene a very special, almost ethereal touch. The work done by the special effects team is also remarkable, specially in the creation of the armored polar bears and naturally, the Dæmons themselves. Another element that's worth to point out is Weitz' work with his cast, as he manages to bring out excellent performances that work nicely despite his weak screenplay.And it is the work done by the cast what practically rescues ""The Golden Compass"" from being just another fantasy film and bring hope that maybe the next film (if there's one) may be better. Young Dakota Blue Richards is certainly a brilliant discovery, as she brings to her role a charming rebellious attitude that works perfectly with her clever and witty character. In this her first work she shows a lot of promise and hopefully she'll realize her potential in her following films. The rest of the cast is excellent, despite the lack of development of their characters. Nicole Kidman is perfect as the cold and enigmatic Mrs. Coulter, and Sam Elliott shines as the charming Aeronaut Lee Scresby. As the voice of Iorek Byrnison, the armored bear, Ian McKellen is perfect, giving his character a fully developed personality that makes him stand out.Now, while the cast's performances are excellent and Weitz' directing is honestly impressive, what definitely brings the film down is the way Weitz fleshed out his adaptation. As written above, Weitz took a lot of liberties with the story, in an attempt to make the complexities of the plot a bit easier to get by the mainstream audiences, but by doing this he turned Pullman's original epic into a fairly typical fantasy adventure. I'm not saying that he betrayed the novel's plot, but the way Weitz has developed the story makes clichéd what otherwise would be fresh and original, as Weitz transforms the novel's sequence of events into one that follows the pattern of classic series of films (like ""Star Wars""). To make things worse, several of the changes done, while probably unnoticeable for most people, will definitely be disliked by fans of Pullman's book.This last thing is probably what will damage the film more, as in the it's the target audience whom ultimately will give the film a good or bad word of mouth. However, I would still recommend ""The Golden Compass"", as despite the liberties taken with the source novel, it's still an entertaining film that keeps that sense of adventure the novel has. Personally, I would like to see what Weitz has prepared for the second installment, but his disregard for the fans may make a second part inviable. Despite it's shortcomings, ""The Golden Compass"" it's still a very good movie, although probably not the fantasy film of the year.7/10",The Golden Compass

76,jpschapira,So what?,8,23 December 2007,"What a challenge for Chris Weitz, directing something like ""The Golden Compass"". After having made two films nothing like this (one of them is the really good ""About a boy""), he goes to another level, adapting Phillip Pullman's famous novel in a super-production. The good news is his choice is far from mistaken, because this is a very good movie and a success for Weitz. It's not for everyone, though. I saw it with a ten-year-old and he didn't like it. I think he found it a little scary; it's a story with many many characters (and probably a lot more waiting to appear if the saga continues) and some are very sinister and not only we sense it but characters in the movie explain it too. Nicole Kidman's Marissa Coulter leads the list; her actions and others' have to be stopped by Lyra (new talent Dakota Blue Richards), the film's main character and owner of a special 'compass'. The compass has another special name inside the movie, and there are lots of things with special and interesting references, but that has to be discovered when watching the film. If you haven't read novel, I'll tell you it's not hard, because I didn't and I understood everything. I hadn't read ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" when I watched it either, and I remember being trapped inside its world. However, with all the snow and magic creatures and the resemblance of a great cast, ""The Golden Compass"" is not only different but also better. The characters are better constructed and their personalities more clearly established. There's a polar bear that is old in age and acts like a mature adult. An animal so full of kindness and honor that it fills perfectly for the phrase ""a bear you want to hug"". Some of the things he says may not be easy for a ten-year-old to comprehend. The kids behave completely as kids. What else should they do? Even when the heroine wants to do something risky, she asks for it and deals with it as only a kid and not someone who pretends to be older would. In a world filled with fantasy, a world that surprises the viewer more by the minute, that's about as real as it gets. If something seems closer to caricature and spoils (just mildly) the things I've just mentioning, is the mysterious government organization ""The Magisterium"" and its ridiculous members. Yes, the movie makes religious references and they're not so positive. So what? ""The Golden Compass"" is very good cinema; true quality that makes it worth to spend millions of dollars. I hope they get them back. Oh, Alexandre Desplat's music...Brilliant as always! It deserves an Oscar nomination it may not get, as do the Sound Mixing and the Costume Design.",The Golden Compass

Next Christmas after it was released, I did and watched it to see if it could keep my interest. After watching the entire movie, I was completely amazed by the film's look. I also read the book it was based on and loved it as well. It had a great story with well-developed characters, and beautiful writing.So, I was left wondering, ""Did this adaptation followed the novel's source material?"" Well, let's just say that, despite the mixed reception it had when it was first released, I think so, but that's not why I'm giving this an 8/10.While the story itself is pretty interesting, the script is completely uneven. The first half is faithful to the novel, but the second half is completely overblown with an ending that felt unbelievably abrupt and I understood that fans of the book hated this movie for removing the anti-Christian overtones which is the reason why ""The Subtle Knife"" and ""The Amber Spyglass"" won't be made into films because of it. The second problem is the character development. Lyra and Mrs. Coulter had the most screen time, but most of the other characters were, shall I say, undeveloped.Flaws aside, everything else turned out brilliant. The directing from Chris Wietz is pretty good and builds a lot of tense while creating an atmosphere to the overall darker tone of the film. The visuals are beautiful especially the northern lights which is the highlight of the film and the scenery gives the movie an epic sweep along with a solid cinematography. The music from Alexandre Desplat is enchanting and caressed by ears right to the very end and the special effects on the polar bears and many things are magnificent, but the strongest aspects goes to the action scenes (with Iorek and Ragnar and the battle against the tartars as the best) and a great cast of actors. Dakota Blue Richards did a perfect job as Lyra Belaqua, Nicole Kidman did great as Mrs. Coulter, and Daniel Craig, although not given much to do, did OK as Lord Asriel. The voice actors for Iorek and Ragnar with the likes of Ian Mckellen (Gandalf from Lord of the Rings) and Ian McShane (who would later play Tai Lung from Kung Fu Panda and Captain Blackbeard from Pirates of the Caribbean 4: On Stranger Tides) did great.Overall, The Golden Compass may be flawed, but it's a completely underrated fantasy film that definitely needs a remake. I recommend this to others who haven't seen it or read the book and I think it deserves a lot more recognition. Thumbs up!",The Golden Compass
78,oneloveall,Compass points nowhere fast,4,4 December 2007,"I am not a huge fantasy (in it's generic form) buff, but do enjoy several of the modern franchises and relish some of the older ones. This one still felt like a hackneyed mash-up of all that remains uninspiring from every other decently made movie of it's type, despite being penned by someone generating controversy for his atheist beliefs I believe. Make no mistake, not unlike The Da Vinci Code, any previously vented grievances with the content of the film immediately and forever subsides due to the stinging mediocrity that cramps almost every frame. As allegory, The Golden Compass is too obscure, and taken literally the sagging and seemingly recycled plot line never managed to take hold once. At least Nicole Kidman is having fun, looking hot, and demanding attention despite being another character that just did not mean a whole lot to me. I guess the best we can hope is that this poor film can work it's way on up to mediocrity with an obligatory trilogy apparently planned (do they even wait for box-office returns any more?!)",The Golden Compass
79,jdkraus,Had the first four acts but left out the fifth!,8,23 December 2007,"I have read the book just days before the release and I really enjoyed it. Likewise, I enjoyed the movie but there was a huge problem with it in comparison with the book; it forgot the fifth act! Rather than continuing to the grand finale that the book had, the movie left the audience hanging. I heard several people in the theater utter, ""Is that all?"" Even I couldn't resist in saying, ""Oh come on; don't end the film now!"" I don't want to spoil the original ending, particularly for any who hasn't read the book. But even if you had not read the novel, you can tell that there was more to the story than the film shows. Save for this huge disappointment, everything else in the film was nicely done.In the departments of visual effects, set-decoration, costume design, make-up, and music it was all great. The actors were wisely chosen, particularly with Daniel Craig as Lord Asriel, Nicole Kidman as Mrs. Coultier, and Sam Elliot as Lee Scorseby. Dakota Blue Richards was not a bad choice for the character as Lyra, but at times, I felt she could have shown more emotion in her character during certain dramatic scenes in the film.As always, in a movie based off of a book, it left out some parts and added new ones. I felt the scenes that were added were good for the movie, and the ones left-out from the book did not damage the story. Overall, the movie really brought the book's tale to life on the screen. This was a very good film, but it needed to cover the final act. The movie would have been maybe twenty minutes longer, but it would have better. Since it covered 80% of the book, I give this an 8/10.-I hope when the DVD comes out that there'll be an extended version that has the proper ending.",The Golden Compass
80,Prichards12345,A not-so-subtle knife to the novel,2,6 December 2007,"My expectations, while not stratospheric, were reasonably high for The Golden Compass. Unfortunately the film turns out to be an uninvolving, rather under baked pudding.Firstly New Line have stuck an extremely dumb voice-over a-la Blade Runner at the beginning of the movie, to tell us exactly where we are - a parallel universe with some similarity to our own but with striking differences. Couldn't, as in the novel, they have left us to figure it out for ourselves? Or do they treat the audience with such contempt that they feel we need a primer? After this the first twenty minutes or so are quite well done, but unlike Lord Of The Rings the film quickly descends into not much more than a travelogue, with out-of-date CGI daemon characters - apart from a few well animated Iorek sequences - and a series of Harry Potter-style ""proper actor"" cameos, few of which amount to much. Sam Elliot is by far the best character in this first of the trilogy, but he's given so little to do you only wish he featured more often. Derek Jacobi is totally wasted and Christopher Lee barely appears. Daniel Craig gets a James Bond moment, presumably so it can appear in a trailer, giving the misleading impression that he has a substantial role in the proceedings. Nicole Kidman tries hard to bring depth to Mrs. Coulter, but she's always been a take it or leave it actress. On this occasion, I'll think I'll leave it.At least, in Dakota Blue Richards we have a likable heroine. Unfortunately her character is also watered down from the novel. Lyra's just a spunky Disneyesque character here.There is one rather obvious flaw. When the characters finally get to the Arctic none of them appears to be remotely cold - Lyra wears a little woollen cap and appears entirely comfortable. I can't recall seeing any frozen breath coming out of the actor's mouths. There's some good moments, such as the Polar Bear fight and Intercision sequence, but most of it feels like a rather empty and soulless journey around the novel. The direction is really very poor, with hardly a single interesting shot or framing in the entire thing. But I suppose when you get the director of American Pie to make a fantasy movie you deserve all you get. It all feels so safe, the film-makers simply never take a chance. There was more daring taken in the 30 second trailer I saw for Alvin And The Chipmonks than the whole of this movie. The script is lazy, but hell, New Line simply want you to think it's another Middle-Earth saga, to keep the cash rolling in until The Hobbit comes out. And for a book which questions religious orthodoxy one is likely to feel extremely disappointed that the philosophical meat of the story is watered down to almost nothing. The Magisterium could be the Galactic Empire for all we are told. An official accuses Lord Asriel of heresy early on. Er, heresy against what, exactly?And the ending, that shocking moment when Lord Asriel commits murder to open the path to other worlds, is gone! Neatly excised so not to upset the poor little mites who will see the film, thereby ensuring they turn up for the sequels.What a cop-out.",The Golden Compass
81,tomimt,Visually nice but otherwise disappointing,5,24 December 2008,"Golden Compass is pretty film, with interesting visual effects. But it isn't a very engaging film. This isn't the fault if the plot mind you, it has more to do with the direction and editing of the film, which both are quite jumpy.Let's pull back for a minute and tackle the plot. Lyra (Dakota Blue Richards) is a young girl in a world bit similar to ours but still quite different. In this world people have animal companions, which present their souls. This young girl, Lyra, also holds an important part in the future of her world, she just doesn't know it yet. Then there is this magistrate, which is inclined to keep their hold over this world.Enough of that. The way the film flows is quite problematic. Despite all the interesting visuals the magistrate never feels actually menacing. And the main reason why the organization does what is does is left quite obscure. Maybe the makers thought people would have read the book, thus knowing those things, but now it all just seemed odd for a person, who isn't familiar with Pullmans works. The movie is full with characters, which stay unexplored, like Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig) and feel out of place in the story flow, as you really don't connect with them.This all is effected even more, when the story ends in a cliffhanger, announcing a sequel which will most like never come, at least in the movie format.My final verdict is: over all rather mediocre fantasy film, which would have had potential for more.",The Golden Compass
82,meydiana-65242,Absolutely stupendous reflection of history and human nature,10,31 October 2020,"This was an astonishingly good film.Without getting into any comparisons with its pop-culture-ordained rival, The Chronicles of Jerusalem (I mean Narnia), I will say this is the best fantasy movie to hit the shelves since Lord of the Rings.The story is explosive, dynamic and startlingly accurate if viewed in a historical sense. Dakota Blue Richards is the most talented child actress I have ever seen and is sure to become a huge star in the next ten years. She embodies courage, fearlessness, bravery and intelligence in a way that would make Harry Potter or even Hermione Granger blush. Her character is a forceful blend of guts and intelligence to the point that several of her actions throughout the story made my jaw drop to the floor, thinking ""wow, this girl is CRAZY!"" in awe and admiration of her strength and courage.For those of you who have not seen this movie, if you want to see a child actor rival virtually every A-list blockbuster star in Hollywood, Dakota Blue Richards is your girl.I was also happy to see Daniel Craig in this film, as he was great in Casino Royale and it was interesting to see him in such a starkly different role. He was stern, adamant and intelligent to the point of lunacy - and I'm looking forward to seeing his character more in the two sequels that are sure to come, despite what the crybabies and naysayers might think.Nicole Kidman put forth her best role to-date as the terrifying Marisa Coulter - a woman so cold and conniving and yet eerily welcoming it will make your skin crawl. She is as also as beautiful as she has ever been, which never hurts either.All in all, the only real complaint with this movie is that it could have been 30-45 minutes longer, but I only say that because we've been spoiled with the 2-3 hour epic journeys on which the LOTR and Harry Potter have taken us. But on a blank slate, this was an incredible 90 minutes of my life and this movie has permanently put itself on a pedestal in the history of film making.An absolute MUST watch.",The Golden Compass
83,WriterDave,Ask the Dust,6,9 December 2007,"An evil empire called the Magestirium attempts total control of the population by hiding the secrets or parallel universes and a unifying particle called Dust in Chris Weitz's clunky but entertaining adaptation of Philip Pullman's ""The Golden Compass"".""Harry Potter"" and ""The Lord of the Rings"" have never apologized about their overt paganism. Likewise, ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" have never been accused of being subtle as a Christian allegory. These series, in both literary and film forms, have been monster hits due to their unapologetic natures that speak truths to their ardent fan bases. British writer Philip Pullman's darkly subversive anti-religious fantasy books have also been hugely successful, more so overseas than here in the States. Stripped of the books' overt atheistic messages, ""The Golden Compass"" takes a reverse psychology approach in its film treatment and oddly positions itself as an apology for Pullman's work. The result is a tepid affair that joins a long line of fantasy films about children discovering they are the chosen ones destined to save the world. At least this film is refreshing in its stance on girl-power as represented in the main character Lyra, played wonderfully by newcomer Dakota Blue Richards, who apparently is a graduate of the Dakota Fanning school of acting. Whether or not this tactic to strip the film of its soul (much like the Magesiterium strips children of their daemons) will make the film broadly appealing enough to warrant a franchise has yet to be determined.The film comes across as more anti-authoritarianism in general than specifically anti-religion. In the 21st century the line between authoritarian politics and organized religion has become increasingly blurred. Since we currently live in a world where a born-again Christian sits in the White House and wages wars in Muslim nations, it's easy to see why folks from both sides of the aisle, ardent fans of the books and conservative Christians alike, have been worked up into a mindless and silly frenzy over even just a watered-down film version of the first of Pullman's ""His Dark Materials"" trilogy, with one side saying it's not wickedly subversive enough, and the other side saying it's still subversively wicked.However, viewing the film out of the context of the books upon which it is based and the ridiculous faux-controversy surrounding them, it makes the grade as a big-budget fantasy flick. Yes, there are too many characters to keep track of, and the film has rushed feel to it as if it was edited at the last minute, but it still makes for an interesting trip. Kids will be wowed by the elaborate set designs and CGI effects, which are far superior to the ones in the similarly clunky but still entertaining ""Chronicles of Narnia"" and culminate in an awesome battle sequence involving armored polar bears--take that Global Warming! Adults will get a kick out the nimble ensemble cast, who all seem to be having a great deal of fun with the self-seriousness of the whole production and are headlined by Nicole Kidman--botoxed, full-lipped and deliciously frosty in a creepy villain role that suits her perfectly.Possibly the strangest aspect of the film comes as an accidental subtext resulting from its apologetic nature. With its depiction of mystical-minded do-gooders rallying against the totalitarian Magestirium, ""The Golden Compass"" almost comes across as a period piece anti-Communist allegory rallying for the fall of the Soviet Union. It makes the film feel charmingly dated. There's also the disturbing subtext of child abuse at the hands of the Catholic Church as seen in the Magestirium's cruel experiments with kidnapped children, which makes the film feel charmingly grotesque.Bottom Line: Any movie that depicts Nicole Kidman walking around with a monkey and preaches the importance of free will, making bonds, sticking together, and fighting for your friends and loved ones can't be all that bad. Despite some of the themes of the books being exorcised and arbitrarily presented by a poorly chosen Chris Weitz (a director known for his comedies ""American Pie"" and ""About a Boy""), ""The Golden Compass"" still has enough interesting elements and old-fashioned razzle dazzle presented with new age CGI to make it entertaining. At its worst, it presents two hours of dark fantasy-land eye candy. At its best, it encourages adults and children alike to use their free will to do something far better with their two hours, like read.",The Golden Compass
84,Mr_Sensitive,Major Change From The Guy Who Brought Us American Pie and About A Boy,7,7 December 2007,"I haven’t read the book, so I will solely base my review from what I see in the movie. And from my experience, I can say this movie does have quite a lot of potential and more or less very entertaining than I expected.Synopsis: Beyond our universe there are other thousand of it. One seeks to control over it all through the parallel universe. Lyra a small little girl (chosen one) must embark on the journey through the north to save her best friends with the help of the Golden Compass that foretold every question and answer.What I really like about this movie was the pace of the film; it is a very fast, and it change its scenery almost every scene, so fast that it doesn’t leave time for you grasp anything (Maybe that also a bad thing too). The story is more or less quite satisfactory with many character, battle scene, also nice plot, character development, and very much manage to keep my attention on it for most part. Unfortunately nothing in the film really did standout and no major scene that stick to your head.Well the score is a major here; seem to be working really well here. And not to left out the most important thing that attract people to see it – The Cast of all well known actor who did a splendid job specially Miss Dakota and Nicole Kidman.The CGI in this movie also is no disappointment, very well done and though from time to time seem a bit too graphic. Overall there are quite an improvement from the guy who brought us American Pie and About a Boy - Chris Weitz.Last Words: Though enjoyable and fast pace, there seem something missing, something major and that what I’m truly not that satisfy.Recommendation: Yes, if you like Narnia without proper ending.Reason To Watch: More Or Less Kid Will Love It.Reason Not To: No Major Scene, No Proper Ending.Rating: 6.5/10 (Grade: C+).Please Rate Y/N After Read.",The Golden Compass

Yes it looks pretty but pretty alone isn't enough to carry a story this complicated.We get the tiny explanation at the start which is practically useless. This film was made for those who have read the book, which I haven't. I found the film incredibly inaccessible to me.It's too long winded, far too self important and self indulgent. It requires a narrator and I found myself getting bored after less than 30 minutes (less than 1/3 of the way through). The film didn't hold my attention very well (it'd struggle to find an audience amongst children, I'm unsure who the target demographic actually are) and I frequently found my attention waning.I didn't care about any of the characters or the plot at all, the film was that interesting (ie:- not at all). I won't try to explain the plot (as I didn't really understand much of it) other than to say it seems to follow the voyage of a girl and people trying to discover a path from their realm into alternate realities & others trying to stop them doing that.None of the characters were compelling enough to pique my interest, likewise the animal companions. They might be the ""oh-ah"" factor for kids but they had no substance and their shape changing abilities weren't explained, neither was why they were with the people they were with.All the locations and characters seem to be very tenuously linked together and are very much a mish-mash of ideas that don't quite fit or work or ring true. The book itself must seem like someone took 10 different fantasy books, cut all the pages out, threw them in the air and picked random pages up and glued those together calling it their book. A hotch-potch. But botched.I can see this boring most of the people who go to watch it with their expectations from the trailer being dashed. Parents taking kids might find they have to leave before 40 minutes have passed, they won't be able to pay attention to it.Far too complex for it's own good. It's like trying to watch Dune for the 1st time or Blade Runner without the voice over for the 1st time. But not as interesting.Wait for the DVD release. You won't get a refund if your kids are bored by the film at the cinema. I'd recommend Stardust. It's a better film & easier to watch.",The Golden Compass
86,LazySod,Lots of eye candy,8,12 December 2007,"Another series of books get turned into film. This time it's His Dark Materials, a trilogy that is aimed at young adults according to Wikipedia. I will have to admit that I never read the books and I probably never will. When I saw the trailers for this film I was intrigued because it looked like something that fell right between Narnia (which I disliked quite badly) and Lord of the Rings (which I loved). A visit to the cinema learned that I had been right by that initial judgment.The story starts as a young girl gets an object of great importance bestowed on her. It then follows her and her brother through a series of adventures that play in a Universe filled with witches, armored bears, talking daemons and a lot of other things one can expect to appear in fairy tales. The tale in itself is a fairly standard one but worked out well enough to make it last. The bulk of the film though is carried on the visual effects. There's something new to see in each and every corner and it keeps throwing new things around at a high rate from the very start to the very end.The characters are likable enough to feel a certain excitement factor when something happens and that is a good thing too - nothing as bad as a film that doesn't have you feel anything for the players in it. Some of the things that happen don't quite make enough sense at the time though and that does breach things a bit. But not too much.All in all, a nice watch. Not boring at all and I'm hopeful for a sequel. I did see the posters for a sequel to Narnia so if they are making sequels to films as bad as that one they'd better make one for this one too.8 out of 10 polar bears in shiny armor",The Golden Compass

So finally it was on TV.The film is a nice fantasy film, about a little girl who goes on an adventure. Before she goes she is given a golden compass that can tell her the truth about anything. Everybody in the movie has a Daemon. An animal that is with the person their whole lives. Children's daemons can even shape shift into other animals, and all daemons can speak.When a daemon gets hurt, the owner feels the pain too and visa versa. There is a brilliant scene where Nicole Kidman slaps her daemon, and a hand print appears around her own face. I thought that idea was brilliant.The film stars Dakota Blue Richards as Lyra... the girl with the compass. Dakota was not too bad most of the time. There were a few moments where I cringed a little bit. But generally, as a child actress, she was OK. There are some big names in this film too... some of which I was not expecting. As I mentioned before, Nicole Kidman is in it. Also, we have Daniel Craig, Ian McKellen, Eva Green, Sam Elliott, Christopher Lee, Kristin Scott Thomas & Kathy Bates. Granted, some of these were just voices in the movie, but it will still nice to see a cast list so full of stars.I thought the effects were very well put together most of the time. There were a couple of scenes where the vehicles didn't look very real, but most of the time I was impressed.There are some really good action scenes. My favourite has to be the big fight between the 2 Snow Bears... very entertaining and it also had a great way to end the fight. I really enjoyed this.I was not very happy with the way this movie ended though. I know it was supposed to be part 1 of a trilogy... but the story can't finish like this. I read that there will be no sequels because this movie didn't make enough money. But that is not very fair for the people who did enjoy this film and wants to see how it pans out. I think they should make a smaller budget sequel that goes straight to DVD... that way at least the story will finish.I will give this film 7 out of 10.It is an entertaining adventure with talking animals, magic, witches and a stellar cast.

Not to mention her accent, which lurches from West Country to Mockney to Weybridge from scene to scene, like some demented Kate Nash. I can only imagine they cast her for sharing the same Christian name as Dakota Fanning. At least she's offset by the world's most overpaid actress.

I'm not sure what to think that you don't get it, but I'm probably much older than you, and you're probably still struggling to figure out what it's all about. Well, in that case I imagine the movie would be a bit unintelligible and odd to you. But surely you saw how brilliant Dakota Blue Richards was! This little girl is a true find and I can't imagine her not having a long and illustrious career.

91,richard_sleboe,Fancy transportation,4,11 December 2007,"Granted, ""The Golden Compass"" employs CGI to much greater advantage than ""Beowulf"" and ""Stardust"" combined.

Gadgets include a shiny airborne dirigible, an elegant coach and a mighty bullet train, leaving us wondering where road and rail may take them. But not for long. Also, we have seen similar stuff in 2002's ""The Time Machine"", 2004's ""Sky Captain"" and many other such blue screen bonanzas. As a movie, this type of fairy-tale franchise really only works for grown-ups when hijacked by a madcap like Johnny Depp in ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" or ""Sleepy Hollow"". He keeps us involved by providing constant distraction from the bland narrative, and if the trailers don't lie he'll do it again in the upcoming ""Sweeney Todd"". As it stands, there is only one reason for adult males to see the ""Golden Compass"": Nicole Kidman in the part of Marisa Coulter, a gorgeous schemer robed in what must be the most elegant costumes in recent history, designed by Ruth Meyers and crafted by Deborah Marchant.

93,Cinema_Fan,A movie pointing in all directions other than good.,2,24 December 2007,"Again, from New Line Cinema, this latest attempt of franchising another trilogy seems to have fallen flat on its face. Director Chris Weitz has taken the Philip Pullman 1995 novel entitled ""Northern Lights"" and shot what is technically an incoherent narrative of poor visionary and bad logistics. While not too over-produced in the CGI department, there are better with less and there are worse with more out there, this movie has the misfortunes of having no overall direction and substance.With short and unexplanative episodes of visual chapters that are conjoined to simplify this story, or to simply bore its viewer, this holds no solid ground of imagination, depth and concern for its viewer. The characters here are more than one-dimensional; they're quick glances of desperation, and repetitive cartoon characters' quickly thrown together and having any resemblance of personality exorcised at stage-one.The monotony of this project only testifies that what should be done in good time to exemplify good movie making has only transcended itself to the heights of bland acting and a script that seems to been have written in the time that it takes to flush a toilet of good ideas down the drain; this movie seems to have been rushed, but not on the screen, this short attention span of a movie will only have benefits for the snails and slugs that are knowing no better, or simply like their brain-food lighter than a tossed-salad.The only benefactors' of this project just might be the tiny tots, unaware of its political and religious overtones, perhaps, that are keen to see giant polar bears and witches fighting the good fight, to see kids and their dæmon's struggling against the dark Gobblers. A fantasy world that they should enjoy, that should capture their imagination, that should enthral and possibly ignite a spark of adventure for cinema, at least.Otherwise, as a fantasy movie there are better out there and also, there are worse, and this, The Golden Compass, falls into the latter.",The Golden Compass

95,mnpollio,"Rousing, visually stunning epic for young adults",8,2 April 2010,"Rousing fantasy based on the first in a trilogy of novels for young adults by Australian writer Philip Pullman centers on the adventures of a young girl named Lyra Belacqua in a strange parallel universe which strikingly combines equal parts Victorian England with futuristic trappings. The mischievous Lyra is housed at a prestigious British school through the auspices of her aloof adventurer/scientist uncle. Her life changes drastically with a series of strange kidnappings of children (including her best friend) and the arrival of the glamorous enigmatic Mrs. Coulter, who arrives determined to whisk Lyra into her bizarre circle. Pullman's novel is an impressively heady mixture of adventure, betrayals, and philosophical discussions regarding the nature of the soul, the universe and the suppression of knowledge by a quasi-religious/government association – sadly only some of which makes it to the screen in any great detail. The story has been slightly sanitized to avoid offending those who live to be offended and some of the film feels rushed. There are a number of moments where a great deal of exposition is unleashed in torrents that leave one gasping to keep up, but one can never accuse the film of being boring. While the film fails to achieve the scope or impact of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, it is definitely on a par with some of the better Harry Potter spectacles and much better than the eye-catching, but empty Chronicles of Narnia films. Definitely the film has ambition to spare and despite the best sanitizing there is still a fierce intelligence pulsing beneath the surface. Lyra's adventures are always novel and fast-paced featuring encounters with gypsies, spies, narrow escapes, witches, scary scientific/religious experiments, and a journey towards the wintry wastelands of the north, complete with talking polar bears. There are numerous fascinating flourishes, such as each character having a soul/conscience which represents itself as an animal spirit which tags along with them to provide advice. One suspects Mrs. Coulter is up to no good as her spirit embodiment is a rather vicious blond monkey that skulks around on the edge of scenes. The visual effects are quite strong, although the battle sequences do look a bit CGI-influenced, but nowhere near the embarrassing vein of some the last Star Wars films or the Narnia epics. And extra credit for the refreshing change of having the hero of the film be a young girl rather than the tiresomely typical young boy. The cast is aces, although the film belongs to Dakota Blue Richards, who manages to be appealing, sympathetic and plucky without ever being sickeningly cute. The voices of the animals are ably contributed by Freddie Highmore, Kathy Bates, Kristin Scott Thomas, Ian McShane and Ian McKellan, who is perfect for the polar bear saved by the young girl who then accompanies her on her adventures. Sam Elliott is a lot of fun as a cowboy with a sassy jackrabbit as his spirit who ferries the heroes around on his decked-out balloon. Eva Green is striking as a sympathetic witch and Daniel Craig manages to be both bookish and dashing in an all-too-brief role as the girl's uncle hot on the trail of a earth-shattering revelation in the Arctic. Nicole Kidman has never been more strikingly beautiful and alluring as Mrs. Coulter and manages to craft a multi-layered villainess whose treachery never reaches camp levels and keeps both the heroine and the audience guessing. Lots of foolishness accompanied the film's opening in the US with Catholic associations crying foul over the film's depiction of organized religion as an oppressive force which tries to suppress knowledge and any contrary ideas that it does not like. Proving that irony is not dead, those associations proceeded to en masse try to boycott and suppress the filmmuch like the organized religion in the film that they insisted did not reflect them in reality. While there was definitely some impact to the film's domestic box office over this, it failed to prevent the film from achieving more than $400-million at the box office internationally and becoming a hot seller on the DVD market. Sadly it does not appear that with the subsequent collapse of New Line Cinemas that the remainder of Pullman's trilogy will see the light of day – at least not with this particular cast.",The Golden Compass
96,cosmic_quest,"Enjoyable on its own, and reasonable as an adaptation",8,20 December 2007,"'Northern Lights' (I refuse to call this film 'The Golden Compass'; if the Americans could have 'The Philosopher's Stone' renamed for them, the same consideration should have been given to Britons) is probably one of the best films of the year and is almost everything I hoped it to be.Based on the novel by Phillip Pullman, it centres on twelve-year-old Lyra, an orphan being raised by her uncle Lord Asriel at Jordan College. The film is set against the backdrop of an alternate universe where every human has a daemon, an animal companion represents their living part of their soul. Lyra finds herself drawn to the attention of the sinister Miss Coulter, who is involved in a plot to kidnap children for a mysterious reason. After escaping Miss Coulter's grasp, Lyra decides to head north to find her kidnapped friends, unaware she is playing out a prophecy that she has an intrinsic role in.The quality of the acting is top-class, although no less is expected from the cast involved. Nicole Kidman was excellent as Miss Coulter, depicting her menace interlinked with her odd concern and turning her into the complex, multi-faceted character she is in the novels. Daniel Craig, as Lord Asriel, makes his character's strong, foreboding presence known despite only having a handful of scenes. In the role of Lee Scoresby, Sam Eliott provides a perfect paternal essence to the film as does Ian McKellen, who provides the voice for Iorek. However, it is Dakota Blue Richards, the young lead actress playing Lyra, who deserves credit for carrying the film. She brings charm to the character, depicting her as the strong-willed child that she is without being too precocious or comprising the sense that, despite her determination, there is a vulnerable side to Lyra. Dakota is certainly better than any of the young Harry Potter cast and can act without even the slightest scent of wood to her performance!While it is quite annoying, as expected with any book-to-film adaptation, there has understandably been changes and scenes have been cut out but the film still flows without much of a hiccup and is easy to follow for those not familiar with the novel. The quality of the CGI is realistic and the overall special effects, especially important towards developing a sense of other-worldliness to the film, is perfect.That said, there are flaws to 'Northern Lights'. It is rather rushed and not enough time is taken to lovingly develop the story. It's a shame because there are some films that could do with snipping off a good ten minutes here and there but this is not one such film and it could have done with an extra half-hour or so. What is another flaw is the irritating way that the producers have pandered to the idiotic religious fanatics out there(the same people who whinge about the anti-religious plot without even seeing the film to properly judge). The film is now more anti-establishment and, rather than a religious group, the Majesterium is instead portrayed to be more of a Nazi-like government. Hollywood should have taken a tougher stance rather than allowing themselves to be bullied by the Bible Belt, who wouldn't have seen the film either way.Overall, though, this is an enjoyable film and should please most folk (book fans who are disappointed should remember this adaptation is one of the better adaptations out there). It might not be 'Lord of the Rings' but does come close to being a junior version.",The Golden Compass
97,Jay_Exiomo,Tries to get into as many directions as possible and gets lost along the way,4,6 December 2007,"The best thing that can be said about ""The Golden Compass"" is that it's a visual spectacle as far as the merging of humans and CGI go, but that's just about it. Otherwise, this film written and directed by Chris Weitz is a perfunctory film that's too eager to cram as much into a two-hour narrative.I've never read Philip Pullman's novel from which this film was based so I have no background whatsoever of the universe this fantasy tale revolves around, and it doesn't help that Weitz hastily scampers from one point to another in expense of proper character development and exposition. And considering the story's rich mythology, it's really unfortunate to have a hard time getting into the story.Lyra (newcomer Dakota Richards) is an orphaned girl living in a parallel universe where the Magisterium, an overbearing ideological group, plans to extend their dictatorial rule to other universes. When her best friend is kidnapped by the enigmatic group along with other children for an undisclosed experiment, she sets on a journey to rescue him. With her on the adventure are, among others, Iorek Byrnison (voiced by Ian McKellen), a talking polar bear; Lee Scoresby (Sam Elliott), a Texan aeronut; Serafina Pekkala (Eva Green), a queen of the witches; and Ma Costa (Claire Higgens), a member of a Gyptian family and mother of a kidnapped child. All the while they are pursued by Mrs. Coulter (Nicole Kidman), head of the Magisterium faction General Oblation Board, which is responsible for the kidnappings.Everyone in the cast do their thing well, including under-utilized Daniel Craig as Lyra's uncle, the Lord Asriel, and the production design and special effects team bring their A-game to the table. Yet the film feels unfortunately inert. The action scenes don't inspire tension nor awe, and when the climactic battle finally takes place, it doesn't even reach a sense of grandeur to make up for a lackluster build-up.""The Golden Compass"" is heralded in local promotional posters as a movie ""From the Producers of The Lord of the Rings Trilogy."" It would be too harsh to expect of Weitz to deliver a Peter Jackson-type of an epic adventure, but at least it could have been a little more fun. As it is, this compass tries to get into as many directions as possible, and gets lost along the way.",The Golden Compass
98,Rindiana,A Compass to Nowhere,5,2 February 2011,"This mechanical kid's fantasy is just as cold and clinical as its gorgeously rendered, but somewhat distancing surroundings. Magical, this ain't.Sure, there are some nice ideas and narrative touches here and there, but the exposition is strictly irritating, the storyline is meandering, the adult characters haven't got any charm and the cliffhanger ending leaves one stumped.Admittedly, the pic's not as bad as I made it look like: the visuals are marvellous and the story's got some interesting points.5 out of 10 warrior polar bears",The Golden Compass
99,gregeichelberger,This compass leads only to boredom and confusion,2,9 December 2007,"I don't know what film many of the members of this Web site were watching, but the ""Golden Compass"" I saw recently was as far from magical or inspiring as the Dustin Hoffman bomb, ""Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium."" Admittedly, I did not read the book (just as had not read C.S. Lewis before viewing ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe,"" or read Tolkien before viewing ""Lord of the Rings,"" or read Benchly before viewing ""Jaws"" - I think you get my point), but I know a bad film when I see one; and believe me, there's nothing golden about any aspect of this production.I will begin with the story (adapted from the Phillip Pullman novel). Now, Pullman is supposed to be this big-time atheist who purports to wanting to kill God. But wait a minute, atheists are not supposed to even BELIEVE in God, so how could he KILL Him (if He existed)?! Anyway, I won't get bogged down in this tangent. The plot has Lyla Belecqua (Dakota Blue Richards, a truly unemotional and uninspired actress in this pivotal role), being presented with a golden compass to help her find a kidnapped friend. There's also a subplot of dust, parallel universes, a kindly friend - Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig, ""Casino Royale,"" who spends a total of about nine minutes on screen), and animals (or daemons) who represent the souls of their human companions.Lyla's pet, for instance, changes shapes and is voiced by Freddie Highmore (""Finding Neverland""). A rule established early tells us that when these animals get hurt, their human counterparts feel it, and vice-versa. Later, however, when a main character slaps her little blow monkey (sort of a mini Dr. Zaius), she feels no pain whatsoever. Oh, well.Some people important to the movie, like Asriel, get to have tigers as soulmates; others, however, like lowly extras, get a rat or a duck. There's no rhyme or reason for these pairings. Anyhow, the tomboy Lyla then meets ice queen Marissa Coulter (Nicole Kidman, just slightly more animated here than she was in ""Stepford Wives""), who tries to teach her to become a lady, but it's no use.Lyla soon takes off to the North Pole because the magic compass tells her that evil is afoot there. Soon, she meets Lee Scorsby (Sam Eliot playing the gruff but lovable cowpoke he's played in his last 100 films) - his soul is voiced by Kathy Bates (who utters one line), by the way. Scoresby owns a dirigible-like contraption which becomes convenient while traveling through the Arctic.She is also befriended by a giant polar bear, Iorek Brynison, a lame special effect voiced by Ian McKellan. It seems even the animals in this picture have first and last names. The bruin, which reminded me of those cute polars on the Coca-Cola commercials (thus I could not take it very seriously), was a drunk, but Lyla helps get it on the wagon and it retrieved its armor. Don't ask, but the polar bears in this region not only talk, are alcoholics and have full names, but they wear armor, as well.By this point in the film, director Chris Weitz (""About A Boy""), was doing a great job of putting many in the preview audience into a stupor; but a quick battle between the bear and the Austo-Hungarian army shook me awake long enough to see Sam Elliot come to the rescue and Nicole Kidman arrive on the scene.More plot holes develop, though, and soon we get another battle between the Turkish infantry (circa 1915), a giant polar bear and a squadron of witches (powerful, immortal creatures who can nevertheless be felled with an Enfield rifle). Oh, and there's also a knock-down, drag-out fight between two armored polar bears (the Thrilla in Manilla this ain't).All of this boring, confusing mish-mash, poorly-acted, badly-directed mess leads to the introduction of a bridge to part two (as if anyone who wasn't a fan of the book series is requesting such an effort).Truly, one of the most disappointing films I have seen this year. And, had I not been informed of the religious ""controversy"" beforehand, I would never have picked it up in the movie. If Mr. Pullman was attempting to kill God, then he must have been trying to bore Him to death.Pullman doesn't seem to have a hatred of a Supreme Being, just a contempt for the movie-going audience.",The Golden Compass
100,Chalice_Of_Evil,It's such a shame...,6,26 December 2007,"This movie had a lot of talent at its disposal and, sadly, tons of potential wasted. With an intriguing (and, at times, quite complex) storyline, as well as some very fine actors portraying the characters who populate the fantastical setting, this film should have been an undeniable hit. Unfortunately, though, it is more of a miss. The trouble, it seems, lies with how it was adapted from book to screen. I've never read the books (the first of which this film is based upon), but from my understanding, they're not exactly children's books. They're more for young adults, and this is where the problem stems from: The movie is made like it's a film for kids. Yes, there are dark tones in the film (it's not rated PG for nothing). There are indeed a few scenes which I know frightened some of the children in the audience (if the tiny voices constantly repeating, ""This is scary. I'm scared."" were any indication). Then again, you often find that kids of today are desensitized to most things, so...who knows? Perhaps a scare now and then does them good. Despite these instances of intensity, the rest of the movie plays like a children's film which, ironically, is so convoluted that any child would be lucky to make sense of it.They do attempt to help the audience understand what's happening in the film, with voice-overs and constant reminders of what things mean and what's going on, etc. However, despite all this, I'm certain that a not-small percentage of the younger members in the audience were unable to follow what was happening half the time. I could constantly hear children asking, ""What's that? Who's that? What does that mean? Why are they doing that? Why does everyone have animals beside them?"", and despite this film's best efforts to make the movie accessible to young and old moviegoers alike, it wound up alienating both. Kids were bored during all the slower talking scenes, and adults felt insulted by the film dumbing down everything in an attempt to make the storyline more accessible to children. All the elements were there to make it great, however, it suffered from trying to reach a happy medium in between the darker elements and the more child-friendly ones.The fight scenes in the movie felt strangely unsatisfying and rather empty, for the most part. You know whose side you're supposed to be on, and while you might feel a little bit of sympathy for the good guys when they get hurt, you're also overcome with a feeling of knowing how it's all going to turn out. There's nothing really unexpected (except for maybe one nasty injury during the ice bear fight). It's pretty much a guarantee that the good guys are going to win and the bad guys are going to lose (for the most part). There's no real sense of danger, and nothing really that you haven't seen before in countless other fantasy films.In spite of all the film's flaws, there are also some good points that are worth mentioning. For instance, the film looks amazing. The cinematography is incredible and extremely atmospheric. The snow-covered landscapes are breathtaking. Everything from the costumes to the CGI'd creatures are meticulously created. There's also no shortage of talent in the film. It boasts a wealth of talent in its cast. Exceptional actors such as Nicole Kidman, Daniel Craig and Eva Green help elevate the movie. Out of all of them, Nicole Kidman fares the best. She's perfectly cast as the movie's villainess and continues to show her versatility with this dark role. Daniel Craig and Eva Green (reunited since appearing together in Casino Royale) are sorely underused, but do their best with what they're given. The film would have benefited immensely from focusing more on these characters. Young Dakota Blue Richards (who plays the heroine of the story, Lyra, and even gets a song sung about her in the end credits) gives a good, whilst not outstanding, performance.The voices of the animals are provided by the likes of Ian McKellen (a standout, as the ice bear Iorek Byrnison), Freddie Highmore (who is also good as the voice of Lyra's daemon, Pan) and Ian McShane (suitably menacing as the voice of Ragnar, the bear who fights Iorek). One element of the story that I really liked was the idea of daemons (animal spirits that are physical representations of people's souls) and how every person was connected with their daemon (which meant that they felt what each other felt, both physically and emotionally). There are numerous elements in the movie, in fact, which I enjoyed...which actually makes it all the more disappointing. It could have been so much more than it was, and if there ends up being no sequels, you'll be even more unsatisfied (for there isn't really much closure at the end). I'm afraid that The Golden Compass is only worthy of a bronze at best.",The Golden Compass
101,r-c-s,unoriginal salad bar of fantasy clichés but visually stunning and entertaining,9,25 October 2008,"If originality is what you want, this movie is NOT for you (well, this applies to many fantasy movies anyways ): It opens with a Oxford college children school ala Harry Potter; you get a world in which different races of anthropomorphic creatures co-exist (humans, polar bears etc ) as with most fantasy scenarios (midgets are absent so far, though); you get a prophecy about a child bound to overthrow some evil tyrant, which in this case is a clique of '1984-Orwell' styled Nazis (check the hat shape & the uniforms ) called magisterium, which holds reunions in a Tower like the council of the Jedis. Nicole Kidman appears like a movie star from the 1930s. Then you get 'League of extraordinary gentlemen' scenarios and the same 'Victorian sci-fi' feeling. Now the Nazis want to lobotomize children so that no impertinent questions will be asked ever again, and a teenage girl, a polar bear and a group of gypsies and witches, a Wyatt-Earp cowboy are the ones who can foil their evil plans; the girl is equipped with a 'truth-teller' (sort of portable tarot-reading device).It is VISUALLY STUNNING, however. Even the trained eye can spot few occurrence in which this 110% CGI salad-bar looks unauthentic. For what it is, it's well acted. I heard sequels have been cancelled, but at Richard's age people grow-up fast, so they'd better hurry before she grows too old for the part.I can see around here that -much like the Matrix & other movies- some people think this is a philosophy book, not a 130% CGI extravaganza. I can only tell this: every one of these fantasy 5000 pages pages books can be rumored to be a Trojan horse for some weird mysticism or counter-culture. The lord of the rings suite of books was inspired by (plagiarized) Arthurian motives and motives from Nordic/German legends (E.G Nibelungenlied ) and is known to have inspired both far left and far right. So what are we talking about? The 'philosophy' of the fantasy author or the pre-existing philosophy of the sources they plagiarized? So people just see what they want to see.CGI is impressive. The bit I liked more was the 'daemon' bit (well, many mythologies talk about human souls taking animal shape ): it'd be great to have one. Serafina Pekkala...Asriel...hmmm...maybe they wanted to have a dig at demonology?You can watch this again & again.",The Golden Compass
102,rhinocerosfive-1,"Luke, I am your mother",4,7 December 2007,"I'm not sure whom Chris Weitz is talking to here. He lingers on the books' mythology only long enough to confuse children, without the depth to compel adults. The situations and plot points are so familiar as to insult parents and kids alike, both of whom have recently and repeatedly seen this sort of thing done better. But so what if the movie's story is less a story than a hash of fantasy elements via Frank Herbert, JRR Tolkein and CS Lewis, minus character, suspense and climax? A world is created, albeit in shorthand, and the ideas of that world (what few we gather) are mildly interesting of themselves, which is fortunate, because this movie goes nowhere fast. Then it goes nowhere really, really slowly. Then it doesn't get there.There are gadgets aplenty, cute creatures galore and more mediocre effects than in any five Vin Diesel sequels. The animals are competently rendered, mostly, but the cityscapes and aerial vehicles look like drawings Terry Gilliam threw away. The most spectacular effect is Nicole Kidman's face. She is very good here, and her acting is the soundest artistry in the movie; but more loving care has been lavished on that bloodless visage than on any of the computerized beasts. The daemons are a gimmick most remarkable for being almost completely unexplored dramatically. Other than the mean monkey, none of these animal familiars does anything helpful or important to anyone. Especially me. At least when Kidman slinks around a room, she's really in the room. But why have her eyes been bloodshot for the last 10 movies? Don't they have Visine at her 7-11?The author of the books has stated that he wrote them as a rebuke to religion generally, so the omission from the movie of the word ""church"" stands as one of the most blatant Hollywood kow-tows in recent memory. So much for that liberal show-business agenda. The only agenda in this town is to make money, and if pissing off the Southern Baptist Convention could cost us between the coasts, let's Disnify that sucker.But it all seems so unnecessary. Speaking of which, why is it PG-13? These kids are in the least perilous-looking peril you'll find outside Pee-Wee's playhouse. This movie's so bloodless, it makes LORD OF THE RINGS look like an orc snuff film.

103,freaky_dave,Dull and uninspiring,5,14 December 2007,"The Golden Compass is being compared to the Lord of The Rings Trilogy as one of the best fantasies to come out in years. I think the comparison is way off. In fact Enchanted, another fantasy movie that came out a couple weeks ago, is much better. Though the acting in this movie is well done, and the special effects rather good, I found the story to be dull and uninspiring.Young Lyra Belacqua (Dakota Blue Richards) is taken under the wing of Mrs. Coulter (Nicole Kidman). However, Lyra soon discovers that Mrs. Coulter is involved with a mysterious company that kidnaps children. When she learns that one of the kidnapped children is her best friend Roger (Ben Walker), she flees Mrs. Coulter's home and travels North to try and save the children. With a Golden Compass in hand and her animal spirit Pan, she allies herself with a group of gypsies who help her on her quest. Along the way she discovers more friends which include an armored bear named Lorek Byrnison (voiced by Ian McKellan,) as well as a Texan aeronaunt named Lee Scoresby. Both offer her more protection.The Golden Compass takes place in a parallel world where everybody has a daemon that is created from their spirit. The special effects which create the world are superb as is much of the animation for the animals. I was impressed with what I was seeing on the screen, but I was rather bored with the story which takes way to long to get interesting. Some of the battle scenes were okay as were a few others, but they were few and far between, and it was the pacing in between the fight scenes that just had me yawning and wishing the movie would be over with.I'm sure the much younger generation will like this movie, but me, I just cannot recommend it. Like I said above, the acting and special effects were good, but the story was just a yawn fest in between the action scenes. This should not be compared to The Lord of The Rings trilogy. That is a travesty because this is just an average movie and nothing more.",The Golden Compass
104,seawalker,A near shambles of an adaptation,5,11 December 2007,"The fine writer Tom Stoppard apparently wrote an early screenplay adaptation of ""Northern Lights"" (the original title of the first novel in Phillip Pullman's ""His Dark Materials"" trilogy). It was never used as it was rejected by the director Chris Weitz who wrote his own screenplay. One day I would very much like to read Tom Stoppard's screenplay, as I am sure that it must have been better than the near shambles of an adaptation that I witnessed last Sunday.(Saying that, I have also read comments on the web from people who have compared Stoppard's version with Weitz's original, early draft of ""The Golden Compass"" and said that Weitz's version was better than Stoppard's and was also longer and more satisfying than the filmed version. If that is the case, why the hell wasn't Weitz's original screenplay used? Distrust that an audience could sit through a long fantasy film, maybe? Or was it just down to money? Anyway, onwards...)The key to a good, literary cinematic adaptation is what to leave in, what to take out and what to amalgamate. On those terms Chris Weitz's ""The Golden Compass"" fails completely to get to grips with the literary source. (Check out ""L. A. Confidential"", if you want to see what I mean by a good cinematic adaptation. That film had 400 characters reduced to 40, and although the Ellroy's original ending was fudged, it was still a brilliant literary adaptation.)""The Golden Compass"" is way too cluttered, busy and disjointed and way, way too fast. It proceeds at a breakneck pace through nearly all of the plot of ""Northern Lights"" and is squeezed uncomfortably into a sub 2 hours running time. ""The Golden Compass"" should have been longer. I reckon another hour might have done it justice. (Put this note in your diary. This may be the first time yer Seawalker has ever suggested that a film is too short. Normally it is the opposite way around.)... And the worst thing about ""The Golden Compass""? The ending. Awful. Rubbish. Truncated. Hated it. It completely omitted the crucial, turnabout events of the last 3 chapters of ""Northern Lights"", and in the process, the true cliffhanger. I believe that the material was filmed. Some of the footage made it into at least one of the trailers I have seen.""The Golden Compass"" does look amazing. Good production design, mostly good special effects (some of the armoured bear CGI is ropey) and the realisation of the daemons is very well done. It also has a fair share of good performances, especially Dakota Blue Richards and Nicole Kidman. Daniel Craig as Lord Asriel is good, although he is not as good as Philip Pullman's choice of Jason Isaac might have been.Disappointing then, but only for me. My Girlfriend said she liked it, but I think she said that just annoy me.",The Golden Compass
105,helmutty,The Golden Compass!,7,9 December 2007,"I must say this is one of th best epic movies I saw. The backgrounds are beautiful, the cast is beautiful and the fights, the chase scenes are quite intense but the only thing I don't really like is the music, it is not as good as the movie, it does not sound epic which most of fantasy movies have. Focusing on the plot, it keeps people tight on the seats with its engrossing chase scenes and battles. The battles are epic and brutal in some ways. Chase scenes are thrilling enough. All these are enough for an epic movie.The story: It is pretty engrossing for me. There is time for characters' development and enough time for the action. The daemons are cute too. The story unfolds in your eye plus the intense action starts to unfold. That is where I am having fun. In the world of The Golden Compass, everyone has a daemon. It is fun to see each person's daemon. Som daemons are cute and some ferocious. Once a daemon dies, his owner, a human dies. The two major fights scenes are great. The battle between the two polar bears, known as ice bears, is brutal and one ends up losing his jaw. It is good to see the director could manage the animals' fights scenes. The last major battle is epic, one of the best battle I saw. It is just...epic.Overall: It does make a good fantasy flick. If cute animals/creatures in epic movies is your thing then it will suit you. Those who read the book and are curious in how the director manage it, it may your type or not. Those who just want to watch a good movie for entertainment, you will be attracted to its charms. It is quite intense and mature. Some kids will find the first part boring and the confusing idea of how daemons come into the world and an another thing: it is quite intense, sensitive kids are encourage not to watch it. I heard some kids saying ""Oh my god!"" at the scene where the polar bear just punch out another bear's jaw. But it is a good film.",The Golden Compass

107,moutonbear25,Busted Compass,6,8 December 2007,"Young Lyra (Dakota Blue Richards) lives in a world where witches wage war and giant polar bears are warriors. The people she walks amongst walk alongside their daemon spirits, which are essentially each person's soul manifest in physical and animal form. The ruling power of this world is called the Magisterium and they seek more to control rather than govern. Everything in the world began at one time with dust but now dust and the supposed answers it holds for a better future are not to be mentioned in public settings. This is a world divided between free will, the individual powers held within the soul and a looming force that threatens to eliminate the infinite possibilities these privileges provide. Unbeknownst to her, Lyra is the central figure in the inevitable clash that lies ahead and her power can be found in her ability to read the world's single remaining alethiometer, otherwise known as THE GOLDEN COMPASS. When held by this little girl, the alethiometer will reveal the answers to the questions that have yet to be answered. Lyra's world is beautifully painted and richly textured but why we need to be there to see it never becomes clear in this icy, hollow attempt to become the next must-see fantasy trilogy.Writer/Director Chris Weitz originally backed out on directing this project. He felt the grandiose special effects driven blockbuster was out of his directorial league. Having only directed a couple of smaller comedies (ABOUT A BOY and an uncredited second director on American PIE), I can understand why he would be overwhelmed by the task of adapting Philip Pullman's first book in the ""Dark Material"" series. I'm not clear on why he decided to come back on though because his lack of confidence in his own capabilities as well as the competency of his audience is omnipresent throughout the film and leaves THE GOLDEN COMPASS on rather thin ice. Once the first ten minutes of narration have given us all the information we will need to understand our surroundings (see the first paragraph of this review), the subsequent scenes seem to run in a very specific order. One scene will explain what we are about to see, the next will show us what has just been described and the one that follows will clarify whatever we might have missed. If Weitz does not feel his magical world to be believable, how can we be expected to?Urgency is also lacking in THE GOLDEN COMPASS. We know because we are told that Lyra, according to the prophecies of the witches, is the one person with the ability to read the alethiometer. We also know that, again because we are told, that a great war is coming. Lyra's special talent will be pivotal to a positive outcome in this battle. The battle itself has something to do with free will, dust and control. What we are not told is exactly how these things tie back to Lyra. Without knowing what all this fighting is truly for (which may be missing as the novel's religious implications and criticisms have been removed almost entirely as to not alienate any viewers that may have been offended by these subjects). Still, we know that no good can come if anything is to happen to Lyra so there is never any actual fear or concern that she is in any real danger. Young newcomer, Richards, is charismatic and fun enough to win over your sympathy and caring as Lyra, but this is not enough in Weitz's world. No, here, escape from each perilous situation she finds herself in is certain and thus the film is devoid of suspense and often disappointingly predictable.THE GOLDEN COMPASS is much more along the same vein as the Harry Potter movies or the Narnia franchise than a successor to the thrown where the Lord of the Rings trilogy sits quite comfortably. Peter Jackson drew millions into the plight of a few hobbits by allowing their journey and its importance to speak for itself and by making correlations between that world and ours. Weitz has no control over the vast ground he has to cover. He's got polar bears, daemons and witches to think about; he's got to build a story when the original intended theme is not allowed to be mentioned overtly; he's got legions of fans to please while simultaneously appeasing the demands of the Hollywood executives that sign his checks. It's as if Hollywood is the contemporary Magisterium and Weitz is little Lyra. Hollywood wants to control everything and make sure that certain elements remain unmentioned and Weitz holds the key to a strong future. Only Weitz hasn't learned how to read his golden compass and what he leaves us with is an obvious play for fantasy gold that will likely please very few.",The Golden Compass

We have James Bond, the Bond girl, snow mountain, a bunch of people receiving behavior modification, a silly plan of the villain and destruction of the evil base. Wow, congratulations to you 007-lovers.Saw it in Bangkok this Wednesday. There are so many celebrated faces in this big-budget movie. Before I enter the theater I was asking myself, ""what happens when so many stars squeeze in one movie?"" The answer is paid to be seen. James Bond is a sidekick, Nicole Kidman is a cold-blood witch and Ian Macllan is an ice bear. The whole plot lacks real material and is filled up with too many elements. The female lead is more sophisticated than all the villains in the movie and makes the movie look like a parody. You would definitely sense that if you notice how she deceives the evil bear king and lately return to the good bear prince only to deceive him too. If I were a parent I wouldn't take my child to this one because the doings of the ""good side"" delivers a message of hate and promote no clear values.However the special effects deserves a nod, only painfully.",The Golden Compass

110,The_Orenda,Excessive and overlong.,3,12 October 2008,"The key fact, if you decide to try The Golden Compass, is that its world is not like Middle Earth, Fantasia, or Oz. The movie, which was to be the first in a trilogy, is heavy in exposition and politics, with the inhabitants of Jordan College and the Magistirium having more similarities with the political halls of Naboo than most other films. That first half drags the rest of the fantasy so drearily that it serves the rest of the film cold. Finally, no matter how they slice it from what I'm told, the ending was the lowest point of the film, bar none. It's much better than the book, but it's just terrible. Anyone unfamiliar with the book, let alone that it is the first in a trilogy, is left unsatisfied.Any hint of atheism is non-existent. My concern was the lack of quality in the effects of the daemon's, particularly Mrs. Coulter's monkey. Daniel Craig's role was reduced to little more than a cameo, and the brutality of the fights makes the film worthy of it's PG- 13 rating. In Canada, The Golden Compass was marketed to kids, with souvenirs, incentives, and paraphernalia sold at department stores and fast food restaurants. After seeing a polar bear snap another bear's neck and a child left for dead in the freezing cold, this film is not for kids and, furthermore, it could be said this was New Line's marketing department's big ""Oops"" of 2007. Thank goodness they saved Roger's fate from being shown!With a film heavy in exposition and politics in the first half and anticlimactic in the end, I cannot recommend The Golden Compass to anyone, particularly to kids.",The Golden Compass

It tells the story of a young girl Lyra Belacqua, played by Dakota Blue Richards, an orphan living in Oxford college is able to cross over into a parallel universe where can see that every human has a personal daemon an animal that represents their soul and travels with them. Lyra's uncle Lord Asriel , played by Daniel Craig, is part of the Oxford scholars and has made a study of the the Golden Shower of cosmic dust that is much a part of Lyra's life.Lyra is given a gift by the master of the college , played by Jack Sheperd, which is the golden compass or the alethiometer because he believes it was her destiny to have it. She is told it will tell her how to see the truth and will instinctively learn how to use it with a little help from her new found friends. She soon learns that the evil group of scholars at Oxford called the Magisterium are assisting the wicked pale faced witch played Nicole Kidman to kidnap young children to steal their souls by killing their daemons. Lyra sets out with an itinerant Polar bear, who was born to rule but is a fallen angel, to save the children. There are many breathtaking scenes of Lyra riding the bear to the forbidden city. Along the way she makes many friends who will help her in this quest.This is a wonderful adventure film for children and the animation sequences are great and the end hints at a sequel. It rates with the Nardia chronicles and is very well shot.Unfortunately the inclusion of Nicole Kidman was the kiss of death at the American box Office. Such a shame they should stop using that old burnt out cosmetically constructed hag she kills anything she appears in. Dakota Blue Richards performs well in one of her first roles and the film is very entertaining.",The Golden Compass

113,joestank15,I liked it and wasn't expecting to. Thoroughly under-used cast but a solid movie.,7,24 December 2007,"The Golden Compass - In an adaptation of the Phillip Pullman novel, young Lyra Belacqua (Dakota Blue Richards) journeys to the far North to save her best friend and other kidnapped children from terrible experiments by a mysterious organization. This takes place in an alternate universe, where people have animal sprites that fallow them around, fantastic looking methods of transportation are common place, and a cowboy (Sam Elliot) talking to a Polar Bear (voiced by Ian Mckellen) is commonplace.Rounding out the cast are Ian McShane as another polar bear, Derek Jacobi and Christopher Lee in bit parts (it has become the style, as Harry Potter started it, to give wonderfully talented British actors the smallest conceivable rolls in movies), and Daniel Craig as a thoroughly under-used Lord Asriel. Hopefully he will be given more to do in the sequel (yes there will be one. Expect it going in). Eva Green also appears and is also given little to do. Maybe she missed Casino Royale and just wanted to have another go-around with Daniel Craig. Nicole Kidman is rather evil as the head villainess. She sets the stakes pretty high early on for Lyra. Freddie Highmore is adorable as the voice of Lyra's ferret who also turns into a few other also-cute animals, but is primarily a ferret.The device of animals as sprites that follow people around was an ingenious device. Are there any real animals in this world? Do the people choose their own animal? In the case of Lydia's sprite that changes form, is it like with the Green Lantern where ""your imagination is the limit?"" Cause I'm so having a dragon/ grizzly bear/racehorse. The movie only skimmed the surface with this idea, but it was enough to provoke much thought.The effects were quite marvelous. The story felt a tad shallow and rushed at some points. Characters seemed to pop up and help Lyra at the drop of a pin. I still enjoyed it quite a bit. There isn't a bad performance in the bin. Ian Mckellen's voice carries more authority than Liam Neeson's ever did as the Lion in Narnia (I enjoyed this one far more).I've heard loads of sh*t tossed at this movie from fans of the books. I enjoyed it. It's a bit shallow and favors style over substance, but I liked it and I wasn't expecting to. It'll never top Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings, but a fine fantasy movie. overall. Plus, there's a damn Polar Bear tussle! How often have I seen one on celluloid? Never! This one gets a B",The Golden Compass

Very tight security arrangements for this early press screening. Don't have time to write a decent review but the bottom lines are: Pluses: Great visual effects. Pretty stunning, to be frank; Excellent lead actress, newcomer Dakota Blue Richards; Some good action sequences. Minuses: Not enough screen time for Daniel Craig and Eva Green; Illogical twists and turns that require a great deal of suspension of disbelief; Undeveloped and even rushed plot in many cases of the film; Total lack of an ending or anything resembling one. At the end, it all just seems like a big set up to the (probably) upcoming sequel/s; which means just one thing: more $$$ for the suits. That's why I gave the film 2.5 out of 5 stars. It was OK, but nothing really special or refreshing.",The Golden Compass
115,Barky44,"It's no ""Lord of the Rings"", that's for sure",6,23 December 2007,"So here we have another :yawn: fantasy novel adapted to the big screen. Since the rousing success of the extraordinary Lord of the Rings films, at least a dozen have flown onto the screen. Only a small handful (like Pan's Labyrinth) have even come close to matching the masterful achievement of LOTR. Some, in fact lots (like ""Eragon"", ""Lion, Witch, & Wardrobe"", and the last couple of Harry Potter films) are downright dismal. They've dumbed down these stories, trying to appeal to the child in all of us, of course this approach leads to appealing to none but the prepubescent.I suppose ""The Golden Compass"" isn't as bad as others, but it still nowhere near the level of LOTR. The plot is fairly predictable; the CGI is standard; the music is forgettable; the settings are cartoony; and it tends to die out in the middle. There are also some real throwaway elements, such as a cameo by the wonderful Christopher Lee that has no point whatsoever; and the daemons (the spirit guides of the characters) are more of a distraction than a necessity, only becoming important for a strangely anticlimactic climax.I will give the film props on a couple of points. First, having a girl as a real, central protagonist is a nice change of pace. The young actress, Dakota Blue Richards, does a remarkable job in this role, and the adults in the film do a very un-Hollywood thing by letting her have her scenes all to herself. This is truly remarkable, such big stars as Nicole Kidman (who is terrific, and beautiful, as the evil Mrs. Coulter), Daniel Craig (believable as the young protagonists father figure), and Sam Elliott (who's gun-toting character is one of oddest elements of the movie) are so kind to this young actress. The girl is truly, and rightly, the center of this film. It's a credit to the producers that they let it be this way.I was also mesmerized by Ian McKellan's voice of the snow bear warrior, Iorek. McKellan has a terrific voice, I am shocked that he hasn't had more high-profile voice-over work.Overall, I give this film 6 out of 10. It's a fair enough movie, bring your young daughters. Just don't expect the magnificence of Lord of the Rings.",The Golden Compass

I smiled when I saw the Gherkin as part of the alternative London architecture. One famously criticised aspect of LotR trilogy was that it was nothing but a Lonely Planet guide to Middle Earth; In the Golden Compass travel scenes are actually quite well executed. I'd like to say that the rest of the movie was a success, but it was not.Much like the attempt to film Dune, the contents of the book could not survive Hollywood. The pace of the film, as if the director screamed ""get on with it"" continuously, gave the film no chance to develop. Crowd scenes looked daft. The ending will satisfy only kids - but it looks like a parody. No need to worry about atheism - there are no room for any isms anywhere.Maybe the second film will slow down and tell the story, but for most fans of the book the franchise is too badly tainted already.",The Golden Compass

Dakota Blue Richards gave one of the best child actor performances ever! Nicole Kidman didn't look like Mrs. Coulter, more like Serafina Pekkala, and Eva Green, who played Serafina Pekkala, looked more like Mrs. Coulter. But they were both still great, especially Kidman. The rest is fine but Dakota and Nicole stole the show. Visually, it's one of the best looking movies I've ever seen. So, what went wrong? I believe this movie was breathtaking before studio cut the quarter of it, so now it feels rushed and kinda weak. Just like they put this movie in the silver guillotine. It didn't feel complete at all and they also cut away the book's ending. So many parts were missing, half of the characters are just one-dimensional sidekicks and it didn't even have the same message the book had. It was just a solid adventure movie, and a fun one. I hope they release the director's cut one day. And there are also some news about BBC rebooting this into a TV show (yay!).

119,pekinman,Horrible adaptation,3,5 November 2009,"I'm giving this excreta 3 points for a few visual set pieces of extraordinary beauty and the CGI effects for the daemons. For the rest, this flick is a waste of time. I have read Philip Pullman's 'Dark Materials' three times. He isn't the best writer in the world but he has imagination which he expresses beautifully within his own philosophic limitations; ie; a prejudice against religious dogma which borders on the childish. But he has written three fascinating books that are anything but children's' novels. And he is clearly familiar with Olaf Stapledon's classic science fiction novel 'Star Maker', a book that cries out to be filmed in this era of CGI mania.Chris Weitz should never be allowed near a word processor again. This screenplay of his is an abomination of the original material. I am very tolerant of the changes that must be made to novels not written for the screen when they are turned into screenplays. It is too be expected. But to gratuitously destroy the essence of the book is unforgivable. He has sliced and diced the story to fit a formulaic Hollywood action film. The result is very boring. I think the mucky-mucks at New Line must have been banking on the huge success of 'The Lord of the Rings' and turned Pullman's book into a pale imitation of Tolkien's great epic. 'The Golden Compass' is not an epic. The result is a complete mess of a movie that wastes not only millions of dollars but also an expensive cast and certainly the fine technical and artistic teams.None of the characters have any real substance except the bear who, with Ian McKellen's voice-over, comes to life with a heart and a soul lacking in the human actors for the most part. And I can't imagine a battle to the death between two polar bears failing to draw one drop of blood, but the fight in this piece of trash is as pure as the driven snow, with one bear dead on the ice. I know this project broke the bank at New Line and I'm not surprised. I wonder how much money could have been saved by hiring good voice over actors who were unknown instead of top dollar stars like Kristin Scott-Thomas and Kathy Bates who only speak one or two lines.And was it necessary to include Derek Jacobi and Christopher Lee in tiny parts? Another packet out the window. Their characters don't even appear in the book 'The Golden Compass'.It is a blessing, in a sad way, that this project will not be finished. Perhaps a more imaginative and committed film team can start over in a few years and try to get closer to the core of these lovely books.I thought most of the cast was miscast. The little girl was OK but nothing more. Nicole Kidman was probably the most effective in her role as Mrs Coulter but her character has been so pasteurized that all she can do is swan around in haute-couture fashions above the arctic circle and widen her eyes when she wants to convey menace. And, yes, Daniel Craig is a terrible actor. His stock gesture of putting his fist, thoughtfully, up to his mouth is about the extent of his acting skills here. Eva Green is beautiful as the witch queen, Serafina Pekkala, but we don't get enough of her, and never will, now.And what happened to the witches? They fly around in this movie like Tinkerbells, arms outstretched like Superman. Somewhere along the line they lost their cloud pine branches. The witch consul in Trollesund was jettisoned as well, thereby losing an important scene in which Lyra's fate is explained. The editing of the whole thing is wretched.And where was the aurora borealis!? It plays a crucial role in the book but I don't recall a flicker of color to be seen in the arctic skies. Granted, I sped up the DVD in the last 5 minutes, so I might have missed a flash or two of the aurora in may haste to be done with this turkey.This is the kind of money-waster that is destroying Hollywood. Chris Weitz and the producers of this abortion should be banned from inflicting further damage to the art form.GRRRR!",The Golden Compass
120,liberalgems,A Film Under Attack By Reactionary Elements Within The Catholic Church!,10,8 December 2007,"I have seen not one, but two, articles recently in MAJOR newspapers attacking this film by reactionary Roman Catholic organization before it was even released! What alarms me most is that secular newspapers are printing articles asking people not to watch this movie on religious grounds! I find that quite astonishing! I'm sure there are numerous religious groups that would like the public not to watch, or read, something on religious grounds. What I'd like to find out is why these outrageous attacks on The Golden Compass are being printed as hard news, instead of being delegated to the Editorial page where it's appropriate to express one's beliefs! And I'd also love to know what public relations firms these Catholic organizations are using because it appears to an extremely well-orchestrated effort! The Dark Materials trilogy is some of the most profound pieces of literature I have had the good fortune to read in my entire life! It's on par with the Lord of the Rings as far as emotional depth is concerned. While the movie can never capture the endless rich nuances of the book - it was a good try. But in my humble opinion, the story was incredibly rushed! The film should have been much longer! The Golden Compass is a masterpiece, not fast food! I enjoyed all three books in the trilogy, but The Golden Compass is just a warm-up for the next two books, which will knock your socks off. The theology and imagination that runs through this trilogy is absolutely subversive and incredibly moving. It will drive conservatives crazy because it attacks religious authoritarianism with such mind-boggling intensity, something truly unparalleled in modern fantasy literature.My concern while driving home after watching this movie is simply this - will the next two sequel's be neutered by Hollywood because it will drive conservatives within the Catholic church bonkers? I hope the author, Philip Pullman, makes sure this does not happen. I would rather see this be the first, and last, Dark Materials trilogy film if some weenies up in Hollywood Central intends to sterilize the remaining story by ripping out its heart and soul!",The Golden Compass
121,jburtroald95,Pure Gold,10,1 March 2009,"This breathtaking fantasy film adaptation of the novel 'Northern Lights' – the first of Philip Pullman's award winning 'His Dark Material' trilogy – is another rare work of genius that – with highly realistic performances and special effects – greatly engages its audience and transports them to an astonishing other world... A world where people's souls live separate from their bodies in the forms of animals known as daemons, where humans travel in giant, bizarre aircrafts, where colossal ice bears rule the frozen north, where beautiful witches soar high above the clouds on broomsticks and all is governed by a lying, monstrous, power-hungry Magisterium.The stunning child actress who is well beyond her years Dakota Blue Richards plays the lead role of the caring and independent heroine Lyra Belecqua surrounded by other gifted stars such as Freddie Highmore, Eva Green, Sam Elliot, Jim Carter and Daniel Craig. Lyra is boarding at the strict Jordan College and feels dreadfully neglected by the adults that she is in the care of and so she mistakenly goes travelling with the dangerous and scheming Melissa Coulter (a fabulous Nicole Kidman) with a sworn duty to protect the golden compass she has been given. It isn't long before she realises the danger she has put herself in and her escape from the icy woman's clutches is a narrow one.After mercifully being found and rescued by the noble Gyptians she sets off on the back of a mighty armoured bear (terrifically voiced by Ian McKellen) to free the several other children who were stolen by Mrs. Coulter but weren't as fortunate as Lyra.The first instalment is a riveting story of righteousness, self-belief, wisdom and spirit. Like 'Harry Potter,' (2001- ) 'Stardust,' (2007) 'Pirates of the Caribbean,' (2003- ) 'Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events' (2005) and 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' (2005) this film is a rare gem with a big future.",The Golden Compass
122,btm1,Well done and entertaining fantasy,10,8 January 2009,"I hadn't read the books on which this film is based nor any of the controversy about them when I watched this engrossing film on HBO recently. So I just enjoyed it immensely, maybe even more than the film versions of the Chronicles of Narnia, and definitely more than ht Harry Potter films.The film is a suspenseful adventure about a parallel universe in which each human has a daemon (spirit) in the form of an animal. Although they can act independently of each other, the humans and their daemons typically stay together all of the time. Any pain the daemon feels is also felt by the human, and both die if either does. Some have discovered what we might think of as interstellar dust, except in this universe it has some mystical properties. There is a dictatorial central authority that is suppressing the knowledge of ""dust"" because the knowledge would be heretical to the order that it has established, much as Galileo's challenge to the orthodoxy that the Earth was the center of the universe was viewed as heresy by the rulers of Europe. The leaders want the people to be obedient and not to think of anything new and different than what has been historically taught.The conflicts are (1) that some have discovered the truth and the leaders need to prevent them from publicizing it, and (2) the leaders have discovered a means of separating children from their daemons so that the humans will lose free will and be forever obedient to the central authority. The heretics have a savior in the form of a young girl who doesn't know she is special. She is given a secret device that is able to show its owner the truth if the owner knows how to use it, but no one is left who has that knowledge. It is the last one left (the rulers thought they had destroyed all of them). She alone figures out how to use it. Some of her friends are missing (secretly abducted by the ruling power) ands she is determined to find and free them. She is aided in her quest by a variety of characters who she thinks initially thinks are her enemies (and some indeed start out that way) including an outlaw group called the Gyptians who resemble a cross between gypsies and pirates, a clan of powerful ferocious talking polar bears, an aviator, and a community of long-lived witches who apparently are mostly ethereal but some time are corporeal. The story, visual effects, and acting are all superb. The cast includes many well known stars, some as actors and some as voices of animated characters.

123,tubby1,A Compass without direction,4,29 December 2008,"Based on the first book of 'His Dark Materials' trilogy by Philip Pullman, The Golden Compass had the potential to be as grand and magical as the Lord of the Rings. Instead with a running time far too short to do justice to such a marvelous creation we have a dumb-down, spoon-to-mouth mess.The film had all the material it needed in the prose of Philip Pullman's work; wonderful descriptions, emotional insight, and yet it feels obligated to spell out, in big capital letters each and every event with toe-curling consequences. The film has obviously been so impeded in its creative process that it will probably only be enjoyed by the young... Although whether they can understand the plot is another matter. There is no characterisation just an endeavor to push the story along - where is the love, the passion?Dakota Blue Richards is very good and performs well as Lyra the heroine of the story. Indeed, Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig do their best with a script which is full of faults and bereft of the magic within the book. The Golden Compass is a big let-down, the special effects are what keep this film above the water. Whoever, if ever this film is adapted again be bold, be brave and be true to the book.

124,rabbitmoon,"Dreadful, awful film making. I wish people would wake up to the blandness of Hollywood",1,13 December 2007,"It would be easy to go on a rant about how bad this film was. I'll try and be constructive.Hitchcock said the three most important factors to a film are story, story, story. As a book, the story was great. Adapted for the screen they have totally screwed it up. It is not cinema. It is more a homage to the book, exclusive for its readers, cold and impenetrable to outsiders. The pace, editing and script are poorly executed. In some areas of the film its almost distracting just how nonsensical the structure is - the film achieves a few dot-to-dot plot points in the first half hour, then about 30 in the next 5 minutes as we're introduced to characters so thick and fast, there is no use of cinema to explain motives, and you feel like you've just missed a reel. A film that doesn't look after its audience is betrayal, its like theft of your entry fee.The acting was bland - so completely bland. A girl miraculously holding on to a polar bear whilst it bounds across glaciers, whilst saying in monotone ""we have to get to roger because the elithograph says hes in danger"". It all looked like some lame TV drama. There was no magic of cinema.Daemons form a large part of the book. When reading it, I heard the daemons voices as dark, sinister and knowing, a bit like 'Tony' the imagined friend of the little boy Danny in 'The Shining'. In Golden Compass they totally got it wrong - stupid children's voices, sounding naive, stupid and pointless. Whats the point in a daemon if they're dumb? They also didn't really fit into the film - more like a gimmicky distraction which then made the whole film pointless - and a total waste of a good idea. And I have yet to see a film where talking CGI animals aren't overdone - the nerds at their computers can't seem to stop tweaking stupid additions such as too many facial movements, whiskers going all over the place, tails swirling etc. It all looks stupid.If you have any taste in movies, avoid this movie. If you are one of those whimsical people without any taste of your own, liking everything that you think you should like, then you might like this.",The Golden Compass
125,thomvic,It's good but could have been so much more...,6,18 October 2010,"I had never heard of this story until I saw the trailer, then heard it was based on a trilogy. So I went and bought the first novel and was captivated by the author's imagination and then read the next two novels. So I was extremely excited to see this film when it came out.And the result..well I was a bit disappointed. For one thing, they made this movie more like a kid's fantasy simply to get more kids to see this. The novel is more complex and deals with more interesting themes. I know they cut all the religious aspects out of it but that was what kept it interesting. Also, if they were going to make a trilogy, then there is no way they could cut out the main elements of the novels because then it serves no purpose for the plot anyway.The acting was reasonably well done. I though Dakota Blue Richards as Lyra was pretty solid as the tomboy who loves getting into mischief. Nicole Kidman as Mrs Coulter was pretty good, despite her being blonde when she was meant to be dark haired. Daniel Craig doesn't get enough time to really make an impact unfortunately. Eva Green was charismatic as the witch of Serafina. The only problem is that besides from Lyra and perhaps the bear, not many of the other characters really get that much time to develop themselves, in particular Lord Asriel.The main problem is the pace at which they tell this story. Everything is done too fast as if they were squishing everything in. The story takes more time to unfold in the novel and I think they could have spent more time developing the relationship between Mrs Coulter and Lyra more in the beginning.I am sure even viewers who have never read the novel can probably tell that a lot feels cut out with the pace that this film goes by. Also a big letdown is that they don't really explain the concept of daemons (the animal spirits) properly and simply acknowledge that it just is like that when there is a whole philosophy and reasoning as to the relationship between a human and his/her daemon. If they had gone into it more, I think it would have drawn the audience in a bit more as well. This is a very important aspect which they dumbed down a lot which I felt lacked a real punch for the film.The visual effects are spectacular and it was impressive to see the effort they put into it. I think more time could have been put into developing the story and characters more, and also they should have made this more insightful in order to gain people's interest in this trilogy instead of leaving it till later for the other films (which there won't be any now due to the flop at the US Box office). And yes the ending. That was a big disappointment as well. Why did they have to end it there when it was getting more interesting and the audience was starting to understand the magisterium's intentions? When I saw this at the cinema, and the credits rolled, people were like 'what the hell???'. I was like that too.A film that is based on a book should be able to draw in viewers too and I totally agree that you don't have to read the novel to understand a film. This one can get a bit confusing because it simply serves you a lot of things on a plate and you have to discover for yourself what you have since there was no menu to begin with. One more thing - why did they get Chris Weitz to direct this movie? The guy who made American Pie? Please. For a film that deserves much better treatment get someone a bit more capable with imagination that will also serve the story rather than jumping from one scene to another. Talk about taking the fun out of the whole film!What was one of the worst scenes was right after the bear fight. I enjoyed the fight, but couldn't they have given more development after it rather than jumping straight to the next scene as though they were in a big hurry? With many scenes like this that simply jump from one scene to the other, there isn't time for you to really absorb what has happened since it's too concerned with getting to a conclusion.It is a fantasy movie and I still love the books. But it could have been handled a lot better which unfortunately, we won't get to see if it could have been better since the trilogy won't be brought to life on the screen. So for all the fans of the novels, just remember the cherished memories of the novels. For those who have never read the novels - go read them now.",The Golden Compass

And unfortunately, most of it comes in the form of clunky expository dialogue like ""Ma Costa! You're Billy Costa's mum!"" or ""That's Uncle Asriel!"" Meanwhile, as fans of the books know by now, the movie cuts off the last few chapters of ""The Golden Compass"" so it ends on a much more happy, triumphant note. Yet one of the strengths of Pullman's trilogy is that each book has a progressively more poignant ending--they are not afraid to engage with the sadder side of life. I also missed the more leisurely, detailed pace of the novel, but I understand that movies have to go at a faster clip.The excellent production design goes a long way toward filling in the details that were left out of the screenplay, and creating Pullman's alternate universe. Special effects are also good, with the daemons and armored bears animated as realistically as possible, and the golden ""Dust"" effects quite stunning. The battle scenes are visually interesting because when someone is killed, his daemon (that is, his soul which takes the form of an animal) explodes as fragments of golden light.Thankfully, however, the special effects never overwhelm the actors. Some of the biggest names--Daniel Craig, Eva Green, Christopher Lee--don't have much to do, but they look and act right for their roles. Ian McKellen lends his usual Shakespearean grandeur as the voice of the armored bear Iorek Byrnison, and Sam Elliott is amusing as a Texan aeronaut. Newcomer Dakota Blue Richards does a great job of carrying the movie as its brave, spunky young heroine, Lyra. And Nicole Kidman is wonderful as the icy villainess Mrs. Coulter. In one of the more interesting changes, the screenplay has Mrs. Coulter tell Lyra a secret that in the book she learned from somebody else, which provides Richards and Kidman with one of their best scenes.Though the ending may disappoint fans of the books, the rest of the movie, with its old-fashioned thrills (chases, narrow escapes, Lyra's scheming) is all Pullman. Try to leave the cinema before the credits start to roll, to avoid further disappointment: the song ""Lyra"" that plays during the end credits is even more dreadful than such things usually are.",The Golden Compass
127,blackburnj-1,"Riddled with problems and disappointing, though never dull",6,5 December 2007,"The first of Philip Pullman's ""His Dark Materials"" trilogy comes to the screen accompanied with a mass advertising campaign and a bevy of star names attached to its name. However, the film itself is a disappointment with few positives and ultimately it is lacking in structure and feels, like some of its characters, rather soulless.Writer and Director Chris Weitz's back-catalogue of work includes ""American Pie"" and ""About a Boy"", not to mention ""Nutty Professor II: The Klumps"", and this is only officially his fourth film as a director. He obviously has some talent but his inexperience is ultimately the film's major problem, though it is by no means its first. No, the first problem is that someone decided that this highly intelligent novel should be made into a family film. I will give 100 pounds to anybody who can find another family film, before this one, that has the word ""metaphysics"" used in it more than twice, but family entertainment was the direction that this film was taken down and the result is predictably quite disappointing. It is aimed at the wrong audience and ends up not satisfying anyone. I will be surprised if this film is treasured by children.The second problem is Weitz's script. It lacks a proper period of establishment. Characters aren't explored. Themes aren't introduced fully. The whole film gets going before you realise it has and as a consequence you spend most of the film waiting for it to get going and when it finally does there's only ten minutes of it left. There is no first act and no real conclusion, so the film feels like a checklist  everything's there and has been ticked off but there's no structure, care or drive. As a result the film is difficult to get really involved in. The story and its characters all lack heart and soul from the off. Then, Weitz's direction rarely creates atmosphere, tension or allows for entertainment in a desperate attempt to crunch the plot in. Individual scenes fail to work well (the duel of the Ice-Bears is a prime example) as they, like the film as a whole, lack build-up, compelling action (there are a few exceptions here) and coherence with the rest of the movie. The film feels bitty  it just doesn't really hang together.All of which leaves the actors with tough jobs and many of them provide moments of enjoyment. Nicole Kidman is the standout of the film's numerous players. She does a lot with the little material that's given to her and fleshes out Mrs Coulter wonderfully. However, she has by far and away the best part. Sam Elliot, Daniel Craig and Eva Green all do well but have little to do and you find yourself wanting more of them. But the film's heart has to be Lyra and she is a real problem. Poorly written, her lines have little consistency in language and her character is never given any real space to grow. Added to that, Dakota Blue Richards is a disappointment. Physically, her acting is quite impressive  never wooden and never over done  but she cannot deliver lines well. Thus, Lyra comes across as monotone and this is a real let down.More problems lie in the detail. The score is bombast, overblown and intrusive to the point that the audience are left with little space to breathe or involve themselves with a scene. The sound itself is deafeningly loud and extremely annoying. The visual effects are largely substandard. Some pieces impress but everything looks fundamentally unreal and, when one casts one's mind back to ""The Lord of the Rings"", you can only think that they mark a step back. However, at times the film is inventively shot and the design does transport you to another world.The film is never dull though and is truly of cinematic scope but it misses the mark. The drive to keep it under two hours costs it dear. You cry out for more and there is a sense that there is an excellent film dying to get out but it lacks the confidence to. It aspires to be like ""Rings"" but comes out on a similar level as the earlier ""Potter"" films. However, in comparison to ""Narnia"" it is infinitely more enjoyable and, though it is a disappointment, it is by far and away better than a lot of the other films out there.",The Golden Compass
128,ed_two_o_nine,A Story Compass Needed To Make Sense Of This,4,4 May 2008,"I watched this film on a plane journey so maybe the tiny screen led me to miss things, because I have not red any of the books from the series and I have to assume that the books are much better (is that not always the case?) as this is rally not a very good film. It is not terrible and I am pretty sure that children will enjoy it more than adults, but I just felt like we where given a thumb nail sketch of all the characters here and for us to become emotionally invested in them we needed more. The cast in general where full of quality actors of whom we really have a right to expect a better movie, and unfortunately I feel the blame here has to lie with Chris Weitz as he both wrote the screenplay and directed. One really has to doubt whether he was the correct choice to direct this movie given his previous track record and if they do go on to make the sequels in the series then a new director will be needed to lend a sense of life to proceedings. Also for a movie of this magnitude the CGI was poor and when you are after the LOTR and the Harry Potter market this is really unacceptable. I would try and give you more of the essence of the movie but I am nit sure I understood enough to do so and am left with the impression that I will have to seek out the books to find out if I am a fan or not.",The Golden Compass
129,Criticman12,An OK adaptation,6,17 February 2011,"The, ""His Dark Materials"", series has been known for one of the greatest book series ever made. Despite, being Anti-Religious.On December 7th 2007, New Line Cinema released an adaptation of the first installment in the series, ""The Golden Compass"".This film was an OK adaptation.The film has some nice special effects, they managed to stay true to some part's, and the acting was good. Dakota Blue Richards does a good job as Lyra. Sam Elliot does a nice job as Lee Scoresby. But my favorite role in this movie, was Nicole Kidman as Mrs. Coulter. She really does a great job as a villain.The problems I have with this film is that when we get to the second half of the book, they change part's from the book. Also, the character development was weak. We only see some character's in 2 or 8 scene's.Overall, ""The Golden Compass"", is not as great as the book. But it's still a decent adaptation. If you're a fan of the book series or someone looking for a good fantasy movie to watch, then rent it.",The Golden Compass
130,simonparker1990,"If you haven't read the book you'll love it, if you have you'll be a bit disappointed.",7,6 December 2007,"The Golden Compass in my eyes was the must see film of this Christmas. I am a huge fan of the His Dark Materials books, and was reading all three in preparation for the movie to come, I was praying this would be the new fantasy epic to watch. I suppose I got myself way too hyped for this movie, even the slightly negative reviews didn't stop me from being excited, so what a shame to say this cannot help but be a disappointment for me. I have a few major problems with this mainly, mainly I suppose because of the changes from the book, in fact had I have not read the book I most probably would have completely adored the movie rather than have just liked it. The Golden Compass is not a bad movie, its definitely better than the first Narnia movie and Harry Potter movie, but after reading the book I couldn't help but criticise because I know how amazing this movie could have been. Thankfuly the entire cast, yes the entire cast, are absolutely perfect, there are two notable set pieces and the storyline still keeps its grip on the audience despite being rushed. The lack of the ending from the book actually didn't even bother me that much, so long as people who have read the book are aware its going to be in the second movie then I believe that they won't be that bothered. Overall Golden Compass is an entertaining two hours, that could benefit from another half hour. Its a great film to watch for Christmas and will hopefully do well at the box office so the Subtle Knife is made very soon.The biggest surprise of the cast definitely comes from Dakota Blue Richards as the lead, Lyra. In the trailers I actually thought that Lyra looked terrible, her voice sounded monotone and the girl showed no expression. Thankfuly in the movie that is far from the truth. Richards pulls off the character of Lyra perfectly, she's cheeky, at times rude but alway likable and definitely well acted. Her cockney accent surprisingly works and never gets too irritating, although at first it takes some adjusting too, and her emotions throughout the film are very well displayed. She carries the entire movie very well and it will be great to see her return in the future films as I know how much dramatic stuff she will have to do. But its Nicole Kidman who practically runs over the hills with this movie. Mrs Coulter was always my favourite character in the movie, and Kidman delivers an icy turn as the villainess. Kidman makes her multi-layered and highly memorable, her best scenes definitely being towards the end. Daniel Craig unfortunately features very little, but he delivers a great performance. Eva Green is superb as Serafine Pekkala but once again features way too little for my liking. The other two superb characters, and my joint second favourite performances, come from Ian Mckellen doing the voice of Iorek, and Sam Eliott who is perfectly cast as Lee Scoresby.However despite the incredible performances its the cruel way things have been changed or cut that made me incapable of ever giving this higher than a 7/10. I will never understand to this day why the polar bear fight was changed from near the end to the middle, and why the Bolvangar scenes are so unnecessarily rushed its almost cruel. Also changing certain characters and changing certain facts just infuriated me all the more! But the ultimate problem with the movie is the fact it is way too rushed. Occasionally it is a blessing to get a two hour movie rather than a bloated two and a half hour once, but this story requires all the time it can get, and with events just taking up mere seconds and events being cut out (fans of the book will hate The Cocktail Party not being in the film) makes the film feel too short and missing something. Thankfuly the bear fight is as incredible as I hoped for, it ends in very cool way, and the final battle at Bolvangar, while way too short is definitely well done. The movie also packs an emotional punch at times, the intercision scenes are pitch perfect and the ending is amazing in my eyes in terms of emotion. The effects of the daemons are very well done, and the daemons themselves are pretty cool, most namely Mrs Coulter's golden monkey which will terrify kids for a while.The Golden Compass is hardly the new Lord of the Rings as many, including me admittedly, had hoped for, but thankfully it looks much more promising than the Narnia series and perhaps with a new director, and less editing, this series could really take off. But for now I just need to get over my slight disappointment of it. Still very much worth watching though.",The Golden Compass
131,Monotreme02,At the same time both satisfied and disappointed,5,8 December 2007,"I immediately fell in love with Pullman's world the first time I read the novels. I loved how it wasn't a fantasy world in the traditional sense, but rather, literally an alternate universe to ours; a modern world mixing together elements of the past and imaginative elements of the future. There are no dragons, swords, grand battles here: It is a world of politics and of personal discovery. I was eagerly anticipating the translation of this world onto the screen and I must admit I wasn't disappointed at all. Weitz and crew have done an incredible job at designing and constructing the similar-but-otherworldly nature of this particular universe. Similarities to our modern world appear alongside grand, imaginatively designed gadgets: airships, cars, ships, and vast cityscapes. In fantasy epics such as these production teams can go absolutely wild in designing the sets and the costumes, and in The Golden Compass these teams do absolutely wonderful jobs in all the technical design fields. The film's design, look and feel is absolutely spectacularly done.Casting was also spot-on, with a set of all-star players who almost seem wasted in the lack of screen time for some. The brilliant Eva Green appears ever so briefly and doesn't have very much to say; Daniel Craig leaves a great impression at the beginning of the film that should have lasted the entire duration leading up to the climax, except that climax wasn't exactly what it should have been. The film's greatest successes, though, are the casting of the more prominent characters. Nicole Kidman, who is almost always the best part of otherwise lesser movies and who is always fascinating to watch, is one of the greatest actresses of our time and in this film delivers a judicious, rich performance: charming and lovable at one moment, cold and vicious the next. Sam Elliott is brilliantly cast as rugged, adventurous aeronaut Lee Scorsesby, and brings much depth and mystique to the character simply with his acting demeanor and deep voice. But the true shining star of the film is newcomer Dakota Blue Richards, who blows the young prepubescent girl in movies cliché right out of the water.The film has one major flaw that branches out to other sub-flaws: Its length. For a fantasy epic, the under-two-hours runtime is just too short not only to contain all the depth and layers present in Pullman's novel, but also just to contain the basic principles of epic film-making. In the midst of grand events and the turning of the cogs of the film, the most basic film-making aspect of all is lost: Real, true human drama and character emotion. Indeed the only character we somehow understand is Lyra, and maybe Iorek. In addition for its lack of real drama and character development due to its time constraints, the entire final act of the film feels painfully rushed: not in the sense that the filmmakers didn't put effort into the sequences, but rather in the sense that the scenes just go by too quickly. Pivotal points in the plot are over before they even begin, and we the audience are rushed into the climax with the film's too-fast pace, which doesn't allow us to bask in the drama and the emotion that should be present in the scenes before it. Even the climax is void of this particular drama because it, too, rushes by so quickly. This film could easily have gone on for over two and a half hours, and yet it just seems so condensed  and I can't seem to understand why.I resent comparing a movie adaptation to the book it is based on. I advocate the message that a movie and a book are two separate entities and one should never be compared to the other, but rather audiences should take objective points of view and see both works as separate entities. I could never understand the Lord of the Rings fans or the Harry Potter fans who nitpick about the films that ""this was cut out"", ""that really took place before the other thing but in the film it's the other way around"", and so forth. Which is why it is with much regret that I am forced to bring up a major change from the novel to film which, I feel, also hampers its quality. Without going into detail in order to avoid spoilers, I will simply say that I do not understand why the filmmakers chose to take a relatively trivial plot point from much earlier on in the novel and turning it into the film's catharsis, and removing the novel's undeniably important and intensely dramatic conclusion altogether.I am at the same time both satisfied and disappointed with this film adaptation. On the one hand, Weitz and crew truly do a fantastic job at transferring Pullman's wonderfully imaginative and rich world to the screen. The film more than delivers in its epic scale, fantastic special effects, and overall good orchestration and direction both of the plot and the more action-oriented sequences. Blessed with a stellar cast and simply amazing production/costume design and a general technical prowness, the film serves as a wonderful and irresistibly entertaining introduction to Pullman's world, but unfortunately, it's not much more than that  a great, enjoyable piece of superficial, exposition entertainment that lacks a sense of true drama, character or human emotion and that doesn't fulfill the true dramatic and thematic potential of Pullman's novel. But I am optimistic: I hope this film will succeed so that perhaps New Line will breathe calmly and perhaps allow the filmmakers more artistic freedom in the next two installments, allowing them to cultivate a little bit more of the mischief, thematic resonance and epic dramatic quality that identify Pullman's trilogy. Here's hoping for the best.",The Golden Compass
132,Field78,Drifted out of course,5,8 December 2007,"After four years, I have about given up hope for a holiday fantasy movie that can approach the high standard set by three Lord of the Rings movies. However, it should not be so difficult to make at the very least an attempt at a decent, epic and well-told story that makes you forget about the cinema you're sitting in, and takes you on an epic journey to a far away land where evil has to be conquered. The Chronicles of Narnia was a feeble attempt with just too many dead spaces to be considered epic, and Eragon, though exciting at times, borrowed too heavily from other fantasy stories.My hopes were set on The Golden Compass, but alas, this uninspired and hurried recapitulation of what is considered by many a ""great book"" (which I have not read, thank God, my disappointment could have been even worse!) made me even yearn for Narnia again.Chris Weitz, who made me laugh with American Pie, was a weird choice for a director, but be honest, would you have believed Peter ""Braindead"" Jackson could have pulled off what he did? Unfortunately, Weitz made me feel more sympathetic for Jason Biggs being caught by his dad while fornicating with an apple pie than any of the one-dimensional characters in this movie. Why would you waste the talent of Daniel Craig by putting him prominently on the poster, then giving him two small scenes smeared over barely 5 minutes of screen time, and finally explain his absence from the rest of the film with just a simple line? Should we consider Christopher Lee's part a cameo? I can think of no other reason why he would appear in a movie for only 2 minutes. Why pay millions of dollars for actors you don't use? Publicity? Audience magnets? Oscar dreams? Every major character from American Pie had more personality than any of these people who are clearly just acting and talking because that is what the script requires them do, not because they themselves are compelled to. Where's Steve Stifler when you need him?I have yet to figure out whether the terribly rushed pace of this movie can be contributed to Weitz' scenario, or the editors having to cut the movie back to under two hours to make it easier for kids to sit through. A general rule in movie-making is that you use the first third of a movie as a general introduction to the characters, the situation and the back-story. Weitz thinks half a minute of prologue about Daemons, alithiometers and Dust is enough, and just skips this part to go straight to the second part, the Conflict. Plot elements we missed because there was no Introduction, he throws in along the way by one-line explanations, rather then giving the characters proper motivation to go and find out what the script wants them to do. Why spend half an hour to convey the message that Lady Coulter is the bad girl while you can just have her strangle Lyra's daemon? So much more effective! And what is everyone doing besides uttering ridiculous pieces of dialogue that look only good on paper or in a Star Wars movie? Has it something to do with finding parallel worlds with Dust, or was it talking polar bears with no daemons? No, just when you think you got it figured out, it is suddenly about missing children abducted by evil religious zealots, or whatever. Even Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End had more direction. Pulling rabbits out of hats is how we suddenly end up with witches when the story is in need of another turn, or when a decisive battle has to be fought. You can even create a unbreakable bond between a girl and a pet ice-bear that wasn't there ten minutes ago when your screenplay asks for it. And when the plot really stalls, there's always an alithiometer to give some direction, that's what a compass is for, right? Don't get me wrong, adapting a book into a compelling story is no small feat. It means sacrificing a lot of subplots, character development and depth, while still delivering the core essence of the book. The Golden Compass does the latter, but unfortunately, there is very little in between that glues those core elements together in a logical and convincing way. This is not a book adaptation, it is the adaptation of the book's summary. Everything of the book is there, but nothing magic of fantastic is done with it. Maybe only the parts that look good on film, like beautiful landscapes, talking ice-bears, and shape-shifting daemons. That's what made me stay in my seat. And that's the problem. I was in my seat all the time. At no point did it drag me into that fantastic world where I forgot I was really in a cinema until the credits rolled. I was trying to make sense of the previous scenes, while it were the massive holes between them that stuck in my memory. Is this what a director means when he wants his audience to use their brains?I really hope it was the studio getting cold feet and ordering a radical re-edit, rather than a ill-written screenplay as the basis for this unremarkable experience. In that case, I will look forward to the Special Extended Edition, to be released on DVD, with a 3 hour running time and all the scenes this story deserved rightfully in place. In the meanwhile, I'll enjoy myself with Lord of the Rings, which were good movies even when they were not Extended.",The Golden Compass
133,the-gossip-king,Decent,7,28 January 2008,"I just watched this and it was a little late. I actually thought it may be the last screening in Australia but anyhow. I have loved the trilogy of books and have read the first book three times and the other two, two times each. I was pleasantly surprised to find the makers of Lord of the Rings making the movie. Although everyone knew it wasn't going to be Lord of the Rings I was still very happy with the final outcome. The casting is brilliant with Nicole Kidman and Dakota Blue Richards being the most radiant. There were a few changes from the book to the movie like switching the bear fight and saving of the kids around. I found this interesting and afterwords I actually preferred it that way. The young girl Lyra set out originally to save the children. Not meddle with bear politics and it suits the fact that the conclusion was her completing her original task. Why they took out the last three chapters I reasonably understand. They wanted a bit of a sweeter ending rather that have Roger die and still want watchers to wonder what happens next. It was clever though some of the editing was a bit annoying and noticeable. Overall I score it; 7/10 Not as good as Lord of the Rings but a tie with the Chronicles of Narnia. P.S. The reason I gave it ten stars was to try and raise that ridiculously low average. 6.6/10 is very unfair!",The Golden Compass
134,thniels,Enjoyable but much too compact,6,6 December 2007,"Philip Pullmann's books are true gems. Fantastic journeys into what could have been our world but isn't. What makes these books different is that they almost never degrade to explaining but almost always let the reader learn by deduction. This is where the movie fails first. It explains too much and it patronizes doing it. I accept that movies must sometimes turn a story on its head to adapt it to this very different medium - it doesn't, however, have to make this change to the story's heart and soul. The very thing that lifts Pullmann's darker material to a state where children and adults alike can read it at their own level.Animation was slightly disappointing and some daemons looked weird and unnatural.

135,Pingo-2,Show - don't tell.,6,20 February 2008,"THE GOLDEN COMPASS has a pretty neat premise, cute ideas and lots of beautiful sets, props and views. There are some nice characters here too, and at least a few good scenes.However, the plot and the script is amateurish at best. This is an adaptation from a couple of books, and even though I haven't read the books, it shows that they had problem putting everything into the film.What we're left with is a film where characters pop up from nowhere, constantly introducing themselves with these boring monologues, music that is out-of-sync with the rest of the film (and was the the JURASSIC PARK theme in the end?) and a battle scene near the ending that's so confusingly filmed that you don't really care.Actors are good, if not great. Direction is good too, and, as I said, it's a very good looking film. Chris Weitz sure can direct, and he has an eye for what makes something visually neat - at least when he's directing.When it comes to screen writing, he should learn the writers no. 1 rule: SHOW, don't TELL.Monologue after monologue, no showing what has happened, only lots of talk talk talk. This makes it a pretty boring and not so interesting film at all.THE GOLDEN COMPASS is a tired journey where you pretty much figure everything out from scene one, have to follow a confused girl with no real motivation and listen to lots of nonsense.But - it's beautiful and it has its moments. I have hopes for it, though. Maybe they will call in some other writer for the second and the third part. Maybe they will put in a real story, and maybe the characters could be slightly more motivated. If so, the sequels will probably be very nice films.THE GOLDEN COMPASS is not really worth a 6 out of 10, but I give it one anyway since I like the concept and have high hopes for the sequels. If the second one is as boring as this one, I'll have to go back and lower it to a 4.",The Golden Compass
136,vinsond21,What was the fuss all about?!,4,11 December 2007,"Call me jaded, but i really found The Golden Compass to be a ho-hum affair. Maybe it was because i had already been spoiled by earlier cinematic wonder worlds like Narnia, Middle Earth, Hogwarts and one Galaxy Far, Far Away. Then again, i still managed to extract some enjoyment from Eragon and The Seeker, which were both lesser in many ways. Not so from this handsomely-mounted but hardly engaging affair. I found myself hardly caring about what's going to happen next here, so uninvolved was the storyline. If anything, i admired the performances at least. Nicole Kidman lights up the screen with her luminous presence which was however found in less than half the film. Dakota Blue Richards is a true discovery - she seems like a child version of the great Cate Blanchett; yes, she is that promising. The child actors were overall very good; the adult big names were however just going through the paces in their various supporting roles. Even the much-lauded CGI effects left me cold, like as if i've not seen better.",The Golden Compass

The lack of familiarity means that I can't comment on its faithfulness or otherwise, and I just assessed the film on its own merits (or lack of). So, the good: the polar bear things were pretty good and the world was, overall, well realised. Some of the CGI was a bit obvious, but then it generally is, and the actors did well with mostly underwritten parts. Eva Green is pretty. Sam Elliott rules. The bad: well, the rest, really. The plot was helped along by people randomly turning up (Eva Green in particular), delivering some clunky exposition, and then disappearing. It felt like a three hour film that had been edited down to two hours by a person both blind and blind-drunk  just messy and choppy. Without having fall-back knowledge of the novel, much of it barely made sense. The disappointment was that I suspect that there is a really good film in there, trying to get out.

No character development, none of the tension of the book, none of the mystery, and special effects over everything else.I expected the sets and costuming to be much better than they were, turning our world 90 degrees so we could see the difference. I've always imagined Asriel in a kick-butt cloak, for instance.It was very irritating that the creators kow-towed to Christian groups and substituted the Magisterium throughout. It's a more compelling story with the Church as the dominant force, and another example of how this world differs from ours. The Church's obsession with intercision also makes more sense.I would've rated this a 2 or 3 but the acting brought it up a couple notches.

139,cafesmitty,It falls short of making sense,6,29 December 2007,"Let me say this first, the movie looks visually stunning. Secondly, your kids will like this, (10-15 years old), especially your little girls.The main character is a little orphan girl who has an ability that no one else has, the ability to read and interpret a magic compass. I didn't read the book so maybe I was lost more than most. In this film, all the characters souls are on the outside of their bodies and they manifest themselves as talking animals. This little girl best friend is another orphan and he gets kidnapped and she decides to rescue him using the golden compass given to her by her uncle (Daniel Craig). The movie also star Nicole Kidman (she plays a major part). And the little girl is played, excellently by newcomer Dakota Blue Richards (not Dakota Fanning).Now... This is what I called the Narnia/Potter affect and not all movies make sense and this one doesn't. It didn't have enough substance to keep my interest and it was completely too British for me. And you will find out.. that this film doesn't seem to be completed and that disappointed me. I can't see this film doing that well from the adult point of view, but it is family accessible and like I said, little girls will love it as they have a character that represents them. Since I did not read the book, I felt completely lost throughout the film because it seem to have started from the middle and kinda felt like it ended at the middle. It as if you walked in on an ongoing conversation and you left before the point was made. That is why it only gets a 6.5 out of 10.

140,23skidoo-4,A terrific film,9,30 April 2008,"It looks to me as if The Golden Compass is one of those films that will attract a range of opinions. In fact it has a number of things stacked against it. It's based upon a very popular book, whose fans will be upset if it's anything less than a dramatized transcript of the text (see some of the reactions to the Lord of the Rings trilogy for similar examples); it's based upon a series of books that are controversial to people who think they're anti-religion; and, being the first part of a planned trilogy of films, it's not a standalone movie.As someone unfamiliar with Pullman's books, all I can say is that I thought this was a terrific movie, with depths that I'm starting to become used to in recent family fantasy films. Where were these movies back when I was 12? Recent years have seen some incredible adaptations of fantasy books that are as rewarding to this 39-year-old as they would have been back when I as 12.I will admit that there are areas where the film travels the road already taken, such as the idea of having a heroic little girl leading the way and befriending an heroic talking animal king (a lion in Narnia, the bear in Golden Compass). The analogies with our real world are nothing new either. But the package is put together so well that it makes for an entertaining experience and one that, hopefully, will inspire people to read the original literature.Dakota Blue Richards is the true find of this movie. It's hard to believe this is her first movie. I half expected to find she had a bunch of TV credits or bit parts behind her, but for a first go, she did really well and I'm sure the director deserves a lot of the credit. She goes a little over-the-top a couple of times, such as when she and Pan are about to undergo ""the procedure"" ... but then again this IS supposed to be an adventure movie with ""how are they going to get out of THIS one?"" moments, so that's part of the game. My only concern is she looks like the type who is apt to grow up (mentally and physically) very fast, so I hope they don't plan on waiting too long before finishing the trilogy otherwise they might need to find a way to explain her maturity.And that brings me to the film's biggest challenge - that it's only chapter one. That's going to be frustrating to some viewers, just like those who were frustrated when Fellowship of the Ring ended on its unresolved note. But such is the nature of the film trilogy. Fortunately, as with LOTR, those wanting to find out what happens next don't have to wait a year or two for the next movie - they just have to go to their local bookstore. And that's the biggest value of a movie like this -- getting people to read. I've heard Golden Compass criticized as being a long commercial for the books, especially with the Scholastic book company as one of its producers. I fail to see how that could possibly be a bad thing. People can nitpick these movies till doomsday, but if films like this, or Spiderwick Chronicles, or Hogfather, or Tin Man, or Lemony Snicket, or Narnia etc etc actually inspire people (of any age) to get away from their computers and video games and out to a bookstore or library so they can start exercising their brains ... I fail to see how that can possibly be a bad thing.",The Golden Compass

142,Iain-215,I enjoyed this!,8,28 May 2008,"I have not read the books (yet) and when I do I may revise my opinion of the movie but on a first viewing I really loved it. To get my reservations out of the way first, I do agree with all who say that it was too rushed. There are a lot of characters in this and we really don't get the time to know many of them. Lord Azrael, Scoresby, Serafina and most of the Magisterium are potentially fascinating characters but way too little time is spent with them. We get to know both Iorek and Mrs Coulter a little better but I could have done with even more. Because it is rushed, the story is quite 'choppy' and I think I will get a better understanding of the main themes of the piece by reading the source material. It's a CGI extravaganza but some of this is more effective than others.On the plus side, much of the film (including the CGI) looks fantastic and I enjoyed the soundtrack. Dakota Blue Richards is engaging and likable in the lead role of Lyra (and she has a lot to do - she's hardly ever off the screen) and the supporting cast are also excellent (Nicole Kidman and Eva Green especially mesmerising). I loved some of the ideas in this story (credit to the author here of course), especially the concept of one's soul as a separate being living outside the body (how wonderful would that be?) and that in a child that soul is ever changing and trying to find it's true form.I didn't regret buying this on DVD at all and will almost certainly return to it. Now I just need to read the books!",The Golden Compass
143,Growlyted,Choppity Chop!,5,30 December 2009,"If you've not read the book, you're likely to be confused. If you have read the book, you'll know how chopped it is. Visual impact it may have, but I was never drawn in, like I was when reading Northern Lights. (Which the film should have been called.) The darker elements are either absent or watered down to make it more child friendly. The actors failed to bring any heart to their characters, so I couldn't care. I did like the sinister man who welcomed Lyra to the enemy base though. Daemons were pleasant enough to watch, but their voices weren't right. (Especially Pan, who came across as a total wimp.) This film tries, but ultimately fails. 5/10",The Golden Compass
144,SeptumSin,A good and enjoyable film if you skip the cynicism,8,3 December 2007,"I was very very interested in seeing this film and when an opportunity came at a local theater for a sneak peek viewing I had to get in to see this film.This film was very well done with for the most part adequate casting and I was impressed for the most part. Nicole Kidman and Sam Elliot especially so. I still have high hopes for Sam Elliot to play a part in the Dark Tower series if it ever becomes a movie series and he of course plays excellently in the part given to him.The special effects were enough to keep you in your seat and eyes on the screen. I was very impressed overall at the effort put into the film as a whole.As far as disappointments go I was really not too happy with the performance given by Dakota Blue Richards and felt that she didn't fully grasp the character. I did not enjoy the movie as much this viewing but attribute it to trying to compare it to the book.I will say that if you are going for a true adaptation to the book you will be disappointed as there are many parts done differently, left out or changed around in order to fit the movie in the 90 minute time. I do believe that it is a good movie overall and recommend @ least two viewings for those who have read the book so you can get your comparisons out of the way in the first viewing and will be able to enjoy the rest.Overall I believe the Golden Compass is an excellent movie well worth watching more than once.",The Golden Compass

Sequel idea: Ben Stein EXPELLED by Magesterium!",3,15 September 2008,"I hear this film's BAD US box office showing helped sink ""New Line"" Cinema (which is too bad since they made lots of money on the great Lord of the Rings and they did the good ""Secondhand Lions""). Golden Compass is obvious propaganda for atheism, but not done well... IF you're going to propagandize, do it with style. Entertain!Just watched Golden Compass thru rental - and have not yet read the books. So I am still wondering why Mrs Coulter is so bizarre. She seeks to undermine Dakota Blue's character, yet saves her from the intercision machine. She hits her pet animal (daemon) which is kind of a visible ""spirit guide"" ---and then immediately hugs the animal and says she DIDN""T hit it....Weird...Beautiful filmography---but a plot that slowly disintegrates into an ending maybe I will figure out the SECOND time I view my rental film...and silly wooden ""marketing"" of the anti authority and pro atheist attitudes from the 1960's. Yawn. If you'e going to PUSH a viewpoint, do it well!Apparently this film did better overseas in the much more post Christian and atheist friendly family film markets. But there are some good points in this drifting film's plot. The MAGESTERIUM (the pseudo Christian authority) which brutally shuts down inquiry - can show recent and current abuses of power: - The Magesterium resembles the 2 top Totalitarian states (and mass murderers) of the 20th Century - the Nazis and the Communists. There the State (and/or) the current ruler i.e. Stalin or Hitler - was the demigod. Disobey at your peril!The Magesterium are ALSO like COLLEGE officials who shut off inquiry (Inquiry, testing - instead of blind adherence) into scientific alternate research, theories for the earth's creation. (Science should be a debate, a scientific battle - not a pseudo religious adherence to whatever semi religious creeds the scientific authorities have deemed ""true"". ) ----- And if YOU think serious scientific challenges to the current science status quo are NOT to be scrutinized - submitted for student evaluation welcome to the MAGESTERIUM!",The Golden Compass
147,zactac,A very fun fantasy movie that the whole family could enjoy.,10,6 February 2010,"Don't believe all of those stories about this movie being ""Anti-Religous"" because this movie is far from it. It is purely whole-some family entertainment.This film is about a girl named Lyra (Dakota Blue Richards) who is always itching for adventure. She lives in Jordan College where her best friend Roger (Ben Walker) works. They live in a parallel world to ours, where they have beings that walk beside them that they call Daemons (their spirits in the form of animals), if their daemon dies they die to. When Lyra's Uncle ""Lord Asriel"" (Daniel Craig) goes on a trip without her (when he promised she could go the next time he returned) she feels abandoned. Then when Mrs. Coulter (Nicole Kidman) a superior for the Magisterium (government for their world) decides to visit Jordan College Lyra's world is turned upside down. When Mrs. Coulter invites Lyra to travel with her, well she couldn't refuse. So before she leaves the Master of Jordan College gives her an Alethiometer (Golden Compass), a device used to learn the truth that only few people know how to read, and Lyra is one of those few who knows how. When she leaves with Mrs. Coulter her friend Roger is kidnapped by the Gobblers (people who are kidnapping children for mysterious reasons). When Lyra is with Mrs. Coulter she learns that she is in charge of the Gobblers and its all a plot by the Magisterium. So now she has to go find the missing children before they get whatever it is they want from them. With the help of the people who are resisting the Magisterium's will she goes off on the journey that will reveal everything there is to know about her world and could change the fate of it forever.This is an absolutely beautiful film with wonderful special effects. When I first saw this film I felt like I was watching a Harry Potter movie but with a much more intense feel to the film that made it amazing. This is probably one of the most amazing fantasy films ever made. Go into this movie with a clear view of it and judge it from how good the movie is, not from everything you've heard thats in the books. This film is beautiful, amazing, and has some of the best performances by actors that anyone has ever seen. See The Golden Compass it is a must-see film for everyone.",The Golden Compass
148,Rozinda,"Not nearly as good as I expected - no it is not ""another Lord of the Rings""",7,23 November 2008,"...........Spoilers...................I can't understand why they couldn't have done this movie like Lord of the Rings. The first book is so good and so original and written with such mature style but all this is lacking from the rather run of the mill movie which seems to be made from the point of view that everyone will already know the whole story before they see this movie so there's no need to keep to the book's strong sense of familiarity vs real strangeness and adults will be OK with it because their kids like it. But the book has many adult readers too! Oxford is Oxford, the uni is the uni ...... and yet, there's something seriously strange about both the place and the events and what on earth is this animal that rides around with the heroine, how on earth did it get there? The book has you guessing for ages and you are immersed long before you discover why things are as they are. Instead it's filmed as we aren't going to be surprised so don't bother to surprise us, tell us right at the start - and carry on like that.Lyra is fine and Craig is far better at Asriel than I expected, a surprise after his for me disappointing and rather wooden Casino Royale Bond. This movie allows Craig to look and act his age and gives him style. I didn't really take to Kidman in this - I think she is completely miscast though it's hard to say exactly why and of course she acts very well as always. She looks wrong for this part somehow. However, if there's a sequel filmed, I'll be happy to see her in the part again.The scenes in the North are superb in the book but somewhat disappointing in the movie. The movie makers fail to make these scenes exciting enough or the plight of the bereft kids dire enough. As earlier, the poignancy this fine writer gave us is lost by a weak script.I hope the movie makers can do better with the next story - which for me is the weakest of the three. But perhaps they'll learn from the comments against this one! Or perhaps, as this movie wasn't all that wonderful, they won't make any more? Well, I hope they try again, and get it better next time. It would be a shame to leave this movie version hanging unfinished.",The Golden Compass
149,Edu-16,Golden compass - no direction,3,2 January 2008,"Poor story telling, weak acting and PC game direction not saved by above average CGI. Irritatingly bad.A corrupt and controlling government of a planet in a parallel universe similar to our own attempt to thwart a prophesy that a young girl, using a magic compass that tells the truth (thats the compass not the girl), will throw them over.....Well, that's roughly the plot. I haven't read the book(s) - and maybe there is a good story in there somewhere - but I am not encouraged to do so by this movie.I took the family (11 and 9 yr olds) on boxing day to see this one - and we all came away very disappointed. There had been no hint in the marketing that this was the first of many films - like LOTR. And at the end we get a laughably poor attempt to encourage interest in the sequel(s). At the end we are reminded that the girl's friends now number a Witch, some Gypsies, a cowboy and a Polar bear. But few of these characters have had more than a few seconds screen time, and so there's little or no emotional attachment at this stage.There are some hideous plot holes - the two I felt the most heinous being: 1)(SPOILER) such as why anyone would let a 12 yr old girl go off with a total stranger to the north pole in the first place - especially after you've just entrusted her with the single most magical thing on the planet.... (btw The acting by the children is unusually bad - and the accent of the lead was all over the place.)2) (SPOILER) Nicole Kidman's character wants the Golden Compass. She knows the little girl has it - so why when the girl is unconscious and at her mercy does she not just search her pockets for it? In fact - why did she save the girl? If she was her mother - (and it wasn't very clear whether she really was) - why not tell her earlier before she showed her true colours....?Some of the plot read like a 3rd rate PC game. ""To get Polar bear first find his armour..."", and the whole 'splitting children from their Daemons' idea - and setting up an evil lair in the Arctic to do it - was completely lost on me. Not really sure if the book is at fault, or whether rational explanations do exist but have been lost in the movie making process....Where as humour might have come to the rescue (as it does in Stardust for instance) - Golden Compass takes itself far too seriously. All the adult roles are played in a severe, humourless way - in fact I can hardly remember anyone smiling. Im not surprised really. If I was an actor working on this - I'd have found smiling tricky myself....",The Golden Compass
150,thomasgulch,superb,10,27 January 2008,"I enormously enjoyed this movie. I would put it after the Lord of the Rings and way above Narnia. I know the producers were considering two more movies, depending on how this movie did. The good news was it did very well overseas and moderately OK in the Theocratic United States. Without having seen the movies, those friends of little children, the catholic church, decided to condemn this movie without having seen it, and of course, their friends the Baptists, decided to ban it because the catholics were banning it - although neither of these two groups had seen it when condemning it. Now I know some fundamentalist half-wit will beg IMDb to remove any review critical of Christianity in these Theoratic states of America, but I am too sick of these dimwits to really care any more. This movie has absolutely nothing to do with religion, is a great but watered down story(entirely because of the never-ending Christian whining), with superb CGI, superb acting and gorgeous scenery.

151,keesha45,"Lions and tigers and bears, oh my!",7,14 February 2008,"Oops, no tigers, but there are lots of bears in this fantasy world. As much as I enjoyed the spectacle of the polar settings, flying ships and fighting bears while watching this with friends at the Garland Theatre, I was troubled by the theological implications. Not since STAR WARS replaced God with ""The Force"" in our collective consciousnesses, has a popular movie so skewered religion, the Catholic Church in particular. While it's doubtful this film will ever be as huge as the STAR WARS franchise, its evil Magisterium and henchwoman Mrs. Coulter, herself a veiled parody of arch-conservative author and talk show hostess Ann Coulter, paint a picture of a Dark Side that abuses children much as the Catholic Church too much tolerates its clerics who do the same. In the STAR WARS saga, the Dark Side represented a political power that we saw in real life as the Evil Empire of the Soviet Union. Ironically, the Catholic Church, under Pope John Paul II, played a great part in dismantling that Evil Empire.The evil forces that Lyra and her bear take on are less well defined than Darth Vader and the Emperor's storm troopers of an earlier cinematic generation, but they are no less real than their counterparts of today. The bad will engendered by child-abusing priests and church leaders getting involved in the mud and scandals of politics bring down their religious support from the masses, not to mention what Islamic zealots are doing to their faith today. Without spoiling the ending too much, it appears Lyra and her bear face many more battles ahead, as do we all, in our quest to find and spread the truth in God. Dale Roloff",The Golden Compass

153,Neenee-b,The Compass loses direction,7,20 December 2007,"I had been looking forward to The Golden Compass all summer after seeing the trailer and it is one of the view times that I wish that I had read the original novels before seeing the film.As a complete and utter newcomer to the series I found it very hard to follow in places it felt as though we were only getting scenes to give us the gist of what was going on rather than the full film - an extra 30-40 minutes would have given the film makers time to let newcomers get to grips with the story and characters and allow them to become fully immersed in the movie.There was great promise of action and excitement in the trailer but during the film it was all a bit flat. The battle between the soldiers, demons and witches should have been so much better - the CGI animals were just as good as in Narnia, which to be frank was a much better film - but then again I went so see Narnia knowing the story, whereas here I went in completely green. In my defence this film was advertised as the new Lord of the Rings so perhaps I was right to expect an epic film with detailed and flowing story telling.The cast were fine. Dakota Blue Richards was grand and very watchable. My one minor complaint from her would be her accent which went from London Posh to London Common at times in the same sentence. I thought a bit to much was made of Daniel Craigs cameo. We watched Lord Asriel get himself taken by strangers only to discover in the ending montage scene that he had bribed his captors and set up a workshop supposedly living very comfortably waiting for the sequel. I thought that his character was poorly treated.The Star Wars-esq revelation between Marisa Coulter and Lyra did make me laugh out loud (much to the disgust of the row of eight year olds in from of me) and to be frank if Marisa Coulters monkey had at that moment bitten off Lyras hand I think we would have had a better and more dramatic ending to that scene! I would give The Golden Compass a 7/10. I was a very watchable and at time enjoyable film but all though out I got the feeling that something was missing to give it that epic status it seemed to think it deserved in its advertising campaign. I really do hope there is a sequel that can do what should be a great fantasy franchise justice.",The Golden Compass
154,morkulv_athferion,A fantasy story without the fantasy,5,25 January 2013,"I'm a bit torn reviewing this. What we have here is a competent production design with top notch special effects, and a recognizable cast including the likes of Nicole Kidman, Daniel Craig and Christopher Lee. The downside is however that the story commits the crime of not being fantastical.The bottom line why I could never recommend this movie is because there's no fantasy here. Sure, there are talking animals, and there's a plot in there somewhere about a girl but after thirty minutes of exposition I honestly couldn't give a crap anymore. There's no amount of buildup that can justify such a thin story, and no amount of exposition that will enchant the minds of the audience.Perhaps the problem with Golden Compass is that it tries to tell too much without capturing the elements of fantasy that we as an audience come to expect from an almost two hour long fantasy movie. Halfway through the movie, it really does become a chore to watch. The acting is half decent, but its the lackluster script that is the evildoer here; I feel like I never got a proper explanation for some of the things that were happening throughout the movie.The story is about shapeshifting animals, which are demons, and they are sidekicks to humans in some sort of alternate dimension. How did they get that way? Do they inherit a personal demon at birth? Maybe this is better explained in the book, but I feel like this lack of depth is harmful to the story. So our main characters eventually set out to look for polarbears, which are called icebears for some reason... I don't know. I honestly was already kinda lost at this point in the movie, and it wasn't even halfway yet.As I've said, perhaps the book is better written. I suppose the plot does lend itself for a good story, but this movie is just a bore to me and I usually love fantasy films. It's been a while since I've seen any fantasy film with such a general lack of fantasy.",The Golden Compass

156,TheUnseenMovieLover,"An entertaining, if not classic, fantasy adventure",7,21 January 2008,"The Golden Compass is based on a classic novel, which raises expectations. My expectations were also raised because it is one of my favourite books. This is why it was quite disappointing to see events from the book being mishandled on screen.I'll start with the film's flaws. Firstly, it seemed rushed at times, as if it is only aiming to be a standard adventure instead of a Rings style epic. The cast also suffers from this mistake, with actors such as Daniel Craig and Eva Green only appearing in two or three scenes. As well as this, the ending is seriously misjudged, ending on a cliffhanger instead of the book's barnstorming ending. What if the film makers don't decide to make the other two films? The ending would be almost completely worthless. As well as this, the intriguing plot focusing on several original, religion-orientated ideas followed in the book has been dumped for a more typical, less original plot. This may make some parts of the story (such as references to the ""Authority"") slightly confusing for people who haven't read the book. The story kicks off at Jordan College in Oxford, in a world parallel to our own. Lyra Belacqua (Dakota Blue Richards) has been placed here by her uncle, Lord Asriel (Craig). During one of Asriel's visits, Lyra rescues him from an assassination attempt, and overhears vital information about a substance known as Dust. Her uncle advises Lyra to forget about the subject, but she can't. Meanwhile, children have been disappearing, one of whom is Lyra's friend Roger (Ben Walker). Enter Mrs. Coulter (Nicole Kidman), who immediately bewitches Lyra. Mrs. Coulter take Lyra from Jordan College to her home. However, after discovering that Mrs. Coulter is the head of an organisation which is kidnapping children for some foul purpose, including Roger, Lyra escapes on a determined quest to rescue the children and aid her uncle, whose scientific investigations have the potential to change their world forever. The film does several good points. Visually, the film is a gem. The established and terrifically creative crew create a believable fantasy universe, with intricately designed sets and props. The creatures in the film are also terrifically animated, and develop lives of their own extremely quickly. Prime examples are the daemons, which represent a character's soul.There are some good action sequences. They don't challenge the bone-crushing battles in Lord of the Rings, but they are still impressive enough to leave an impression. The best action set piece is when two ice bears clash over Lyra, with their huge blows and expertly co-ordinated combat keeping me on the edge of my seat.There is also an incredibly committed cast. Blue Richards gives an honest and heartfelt portrayal of Lyra, matching my expectations for how the character should be portrayed. Nicole Kidman is both menacing and complex as the villain of the piece, whilst Sam Elliott is wise and charming as aeronaut Lee Scoresby. Despite the fact that he is restricted by the film's short running time, Craig is also brilliant, painting a thoroughly compelling portrait of his character in his short screen time. Also terrific in supporting roles are Derek Jacobi, Simon McBurney and Jack Shephard.Chris Weitz gives lacklustre direction, putting little effort into breathing life into the film. The fact that Weitz had been slacking for months in California before becoming the films director could be the reason why. It is a exceptional testament to the superb cast and crew that the film is as entertaining as it turned out to be. I sincerely hope that they hire a better, more accomplished director for the next film.Weitz also delivers the screenplay for the film, which is just better than his work behind the camera. The first act of the film, which is spent setting up Lyra and the story, shows good potential for effective characterisation throughout the film. However, this potential is lost in the rush of the second and third acts, with the cast valiantly fighting to make their characters memorable. Overall, this is a effective fantasy adventure, with a brilliant cast and crew, excellent visuals and decent action sequences. During the credits, I was feeling quite resentful towards Weitz, but the terrific Kate Bush song ""Lyra"" cheered me up.",The Golden Compass
157,divyanka,"An interesting and mysterious movie, but disappointing cliffhanger",7,5 February 2017,"This movie is serious and sad, but also mysterious and adventurous. The story is interesting and keeps the audience waiting to see what happens next. The idea of the 'demon', who is actually part of the human, is very interesting. However, it is not made clear why they are called 'demons', as they do not have any negative qualities. The story seems to represent a futuristic world, like in the 'Hunger Games', in which there is a cruel 'authority' that wants to control everyone. It is very disappointing to have a cliffhanger at the end that offers no solution to what happens next. If the movie was intended to be continued, it should have been a long time ago.

There are several things I didn't like about this movie. I don't know the book's original plot, but in the end of this movie it's obvious that it ends in a different way. This is one of the biggest problems. They made an upbeat ending, but it looks so unfinished. Though Philip Pullman himself agreed on this version, I think he and the studio made a wrong choice. The Golden Compass should have contained all the plot and should have been made about 2 and a half hours long to be a whole story. New Line Cinema and Chris Weitz hoped it would be a success, and picked the best ending for a potential sequel's beginning, but they should have been more wise and cautious. Too many questions left unanswered. So for me the main problem is the way in which the film was made and how the plot was adopted for the movie. But aprat from it it's a decent fantasy family film. I liked it very much in my childhood and though I like it less now, I'm not totally disappointed. If LOTR was a masterpiece, Stardust was a brilliant movie, The Golden Compass is just good and plain. I'd like too see it's sequel. It is intriguing, has good visual effects, good score. Actors are quite fine. Nicole Kidman did a great performance, as well as Dakota Blue Richards did a good job for an early teen she was. All in all, I recommend this film to those who know what they'll see and who don't have wrong expectations.

160,Euphorbia,Dakota Blue Richards IS Lyra,8,7 December 2007,"I love Pullman's trilogy, His Dark Materials, and have read it 3 times. I saw the movie opening day, and I love it, too. Sure the story has been changed in many ways -- think of it as The Golden Compass in Yet Another Universe -- but it works just fine as a 2-hour film. If you want a word accurate dramatization, get the superb audio CD boxed set, of Pullman and a full cast reading for 36 hours. In the film, the characters and conflicts are true to Pullman's creation. The visuals are brilliant, especially the transforming daemons and the strangely propelled vehicles. The grownup performances are all solid, both energetic and respectful of the material. But the story is all about young Lyra, and Dakota Blue Richards is simply perfect. If the Oscars mean anything at all (occasionally they do) she will at least be nominated for Best Actress, and deserves to win. Lyra is a little girl like no other (this is the heart of the story) and Miss Richards makes us believe. No, the movie is not perfect. It might be hard to follow if you don't know the books, and disorienting if you do. Also it seems rushed. I sure hope New Line will offer an extended DVD version -- and then go on to make the next 2 (or 3, or 4) Lyra movies.",The Golden Compass
161,georgebush,changed mind,10,6 December 2007,I have changed my mind on this after viewing this film more closely. I had expected a very anti Christian propaganda film. I had heard all over the web and TV that the book hated Christians and Catholics and was the youth version of Da Vinci Code with evil catholics everywhere. Also the book apparently blurred the line of evil concerning demons.The movie is not anti Christian. No crosses are seen and there is no reference to Jesus. Even the demons are not evil so they are not related to real demons which are deeply evil. The word demon is spelled Daemon in the film during on brief subtitled scene. Graphic violence is much less than the third Lord of the Rings. Action is a plenty. The story line is easier to understand than some of the Harry Potter films. Or Beowolf with so many disgusting gross scenes. Golden Compass is classy.The lead and hero is a young girl about 12 or 13. She is truly courageous and role model for any age. The motivations of some characters are not placed in our laps which is the beauty of film. We get to imagine what an expression means rather than a book which spells out thoughts. This is a fun film for all ages and a clear line of good and evil.,The Golden Compass
162,galahad58,Average,5,6 May 2008,This movie boasts a lot of very beautiful special effects. The ice bear is a marvel to watch and the daemons are a wonderful addition to the story. The script is not very strong and needs the effects to push it along. It is not a very inspired movie and has a great deal of low points. Sam Elliot is the best part of the movie. He brings life to an average movie and his scenes are the best part of the film. Who keeps giving Nicole Kidman kudos for acting? She is by far one of the most overrated actresses of our time. Her performance is horribly bad and terribly bland. A cardboard cutout would have had more life and talent in her role. This movie gets a 5 because of Kidman's poor performance.,The Golden Compass
163,MoneyMagnet,One of the worst adaptations I've ever seen,2,3 May 2008,"I read the books and enjoyed them but wasn't a huge fan... so if I'm horrified at this adaptation I can't imagine how the real fans of the book feel. This is a movie that could have pleased no one. People who hadn't read the book feel utterly drowned in boring expository talk; people who have read the book are merely dropping their jaws in disbelief at how badly a production team could just... not... GET IT.By any rule of screen adaptation this one sucks. When adapting a novel for film, you must make choices - you must choose which scenes you wish to lovingly highlight, and which scenes must be telescoped and which must be dropped. The screenwriters did none of that, instead opting to belabor the plotine over character, drama and any sense of wonder. Every bit of plot in the book got its 15 seconds of exposition... meanwhile, the utterly KEY relationship between Lyra and her daemon was barely touched on at all. How can you screw that up??? Pan was just an animal who tagged around with Lyra in this film. Instead, the filmmakers bizarrely felt that this story was somehow all about the great love between Lyra and Iorek, which at times started to feel just creepy. Sure, Iorek was Lyra's great ally, but this story is NOT about them! Daniel Craig as Lord Asriel... oy. Craig is a fine actor in his own right, I love him as Bond, but he is NOT Lord Asriel (think: Timothy Dalton, who played him on stage). By the time they were showing made-up scenes of Asriel being captured in the North and saying ""Wait, let's talk this out like gentlemen,"" I was throwing stuff at the screen. WTF? Having Asriel act completely out of character for the sake of some formulaic chuckles? So many little things done utterly wrong. Mrs. Coulter's daemon: why was he as big as a freaking chimpanzee? He was supposed to be a golden tamarin, which is a small monkey... And the CGI on some of the daemons was just horrible; Pixar has nothing to worry about. Some of the CGI in the armored bear fight was just embarrassing... and what was with the bloodlessness of it all? Why did people explode into showers of sparks when shot? As for the ending, there's not much to say except wow, probably the most dazzling and compelling final chapter of any popular novel in the last 30 years was sacrificed for some silly-ass treacly ""we're all safe now"" crap as the producers no doubt anticipated their highly profitable franchise to come. This movie's failure is sad for the Golden Compass fans who deserved so much better (not to mention the general movie-going public), but for the producers of this film, a failure RICHLY deserved. Choke on it.",The Golden Compass
164,the-evil-cult,"An Intense, Visually Pleasant Movie",7,11 January 2008,"The Golden Compass takes place in what is described as a parallel world, so the rules of nature in this world is different to our world. In this world, an organization called the Magisterium threatens to dominate and gain a monopoly on truth. After they kidnap children, a young girl named Lyra goes off into the north to rescue them.The special effects and imagery in this movie are very attractive. The story is a very interesting one, and the protagonist Lyra is played well by Dakota Blue Richards.Like each Lord of the Rings movie, this movie is not complete. I did not realize this until after the movie ended. To have to watch another movie or read another book is disappointing. Personally I feel that a movie should be complete from beginning to end. This saves viewers the hassle of having to find every piece.While watching the movie, many concepts are thrown in very quickly, many of which are confusing concepts about the nature of the parallel universe, for example, the daemons, as well as subplots like the fighting bears. These many things all thrown at you quickly can lead to confusion among viewers, especially for children. For me, it left me feeling detached from the movie.Another criticism is the intensity of the movie. This is not a light movie as I expected. There is a lot of rough fighting, killing, and violence, and it is all performed with very loud music and sound effects. At the end of one scene involving fighting bears, a small child in the theater started screaming in fright.",The Golden Compass
165,Kareneo,Literally the worst book-to-movie adaptation I have ever seen.,1,17 June 2015,"If you are five years old, you may enjoy this film. If you are older, you may sense that there are important elements of the story missing that would help you to make sense of it. I was deeply shocked at some of the major plot-points that were left out of this film in an effort to make it family-friendly. First of all, Pantalaimon is Lyra's externalised soul, and to give him an 'Alvin and the Chipmunks' cloying and sickly-sweet voice was an insult to the character. Lyra's character was one of a wild child, and Pantalaimon a wild beast - so anyway - that is just for starters. I would be here all day if I listed all the things that were left out or dumbed-down, but another major fault was - little Tony Markarios had his daemon severed, and so he becomes little more than a zombie or a corporeal ghost, before his remaining body dies from the shock of having his soul sliced away from him by the Oblation Board. I cannot understand why they would remove one of the most important plot-points! Iorek Byrnison is also a wild beast, and the whole point of his character is that he has no vanity, and yet they gave him horrendously fancy and frilly armour, again completely at odds with the whole point of his character! So many other ways in which they strayed from the story but it hurts too much to go on. This is a film that needs to re-done and directed by someone like David Yates, who totally 'gets' stories like this. It was either adapted and directed by stupid people or an extremely conservative 'family values' committee. If you want pure undiluted entertainment, read the book.",The Golden Compass
166,CalvinValjean,"New Line Cinema Should Apologize To Chris Weitz, and Both Of Them Should Apologize To Philip Pullman!",5,28 November 2010,"It's been three years since this film came out. I still remember going to an advanced screening with my girlfriend. She was a die-hard fan of the books and had gotten me into them. When the movie ended I looked at her to see she was pouting sadly. We both knew it wasn't very good.What's so frustrating is that the potential was clearly there. The cast is great and the first half hour or so is excellent. But once Lyra's adventures start, the film becomes very choppy, events feel rushed, explanations and characters feel tossed in, some scenes even feel out of order, and the result is a messy movie lacking drama. Watching it, you definitely get the sense that more scenes were filmed, most infamously the ending. The book's ending was shot but then cut shortly before the release to end on an upbeat note. What New Line failed to consider when making this absurd decision was that the film's new ending was abrupt, unsatisfying, unclimatic, and left audiences underwhelmed. Whenever I talk to people who saw the movie without reading the book, they tend to respond with ""Yeah, I kinda liked it...I think,"" not quite sure that they fully got the story. Even Chris Weitz was disappointed with the released version of the film.Underlying this whole affair was a controversy over a taboo subject. Pullman's book series is openly critical of religion, initially just the Catholic Church, and eventually Christianity in general. And that was what made the series provocative and unique! With the movie, everyone tried to tip-toe around this or apologize for it. People would say ""Oh, the books aren't really anti-religion; they're just anti-church."" Nicole Kidman even said that she would never do the movie if she had felt it was REALLY anti-Catholic.Why can't people understand? It's OKAY TO BE AN ATHEIST! And it's OKAY to create books and films that challenge religion and ask provocative questions! I'm an atheist and feel no shame in it, neither does Philip Pullman. It's sad that New Line was too scared to tackle a major subject.Not that it mattered because religious fundamentalists attacked the movie anyway without seeing it. I still remember getting random emails from coworkers ""warning"" me about this new movie that we had to boycott because it was ""preaching atheism to kids"" (I never understood why that's apparently wrong but preaching religion to kids is acceptable). Other people made comments like ""I'm scared to see the movie because I hear it attacks Christianity."" And my response is: you're entitled to your beliefs, but then isn't Pullman entitled to his own? If you're honestly scared of anything that criticizes your beliefs then, sorry to say this, but you are living proof of how religion can control people.In the end, The Golden Compass was a colossal screw-up: a good book adapted into what could have been a potentially good film, chopped up into a messy film by a studio fearing controversy, and further tarnished in reputation by religious individuals who are offended by the sheer existence of atheism. New Line may have made a more profitable movie if they had challenged religion more directly and marketed it as ""The Controversial New Fantasy That Has Everyone Talking."" Instead they ruined Weitz's film. BOTTOM LINE: New Line owes an apology to Weitz, and both of them owe an apology to Pullman.",The Golden Compass
167,AdrianOlonan,"Its Parallel World's Grandeur Is Unparalleled... ""The Golden Compass"" Deserves a Sequel!",9,27 December 2014,"The story is very good. It tells the story of Lyra Belacqua and her daemon Pantalaimon as they find their missing friends, Billy and Roger.The twists are unexpected. Action sequences are good. Music is apt. How I wish I can go to this parallel world!I really liked this movie just how I like the ""Narnia"" movies. The parallel world is amazing. The zeppelins, the airships, and the weird carriage are awesome! The talking animals are cute, especially Pantalaimon and Iorek Byrnison. The Alethiometer, also known as the Golden Compass, is otherworldly beautiful.I don't like that there are some scenes in the trailer which are absent in the final movie version. There are some boring scenes for children. Anyway, the movie is great and a sequel is a must.",The Golden Compass
168,a-little-squeek,Golden Com...PASS,4,19 December 2007,"I only rated it this highly because of the superior CGI, and the associated scenery, which is fabulous. How people could seriously be concerned about their children being exposed to anti-religion themes supposedly contained in this film is beyond me. I think that all the hoo-ha on this subject was generated to get more people into the theater to see what all the fuss was about. Firstly, I am an adult, and I could barely follow the plot. I guess the allegory was lost on me. Secondly, this is not a film that I would recommend for children because of a number of violent scenes in it. The female child lead grated on me after about twenty minutes. I was VERY antsy in my seat after the first hour and was tempted to walk, but decided to see how it all played out. By the time it was over I felt deflated and exhausted. No I didn't read the book, nor do I care to. I think comparisons of movies to books and vice versa is ridiculous. Each should stand on its own merit. This movie stands shakily. I'm sorry I spent the money on it, even though Nicole Kidman looked great.",The Golden Compass
169,CagedinSanity,"Functional, if flawed from its source material",7,19 March 2012,"It's not usually wise to open with a disclaimer of any sort, but I feel the need to add to some humility alongside moderate credibility: I know nothing of the source material, beyond only the slightest bit of research (After watching the movie). I read some of the differences, and how the fans of the source material have basically disowned this movie's existence. Partly, I can understand that. Eragon was a decent book series that was slaughtered with its movie. Difference in this situation however, is that this movie is still fairly functional.It's trailers fascinated me a few years ago but the ability to watch it has slipped beneath my radar several times. It played on TV but I could never catch the beginning, thus missing vital explanations and I lacked context for the snippets I did see, but every scene was captivating and I saw around twenty minutes without knowing what the hell was going on.That has been remedied, at last. And my fascination remains. Again, I cannot speak for the inaccuracies it may hold. However the movie itself has decent writing, effects, and acting. To wit, I am not even a fond of most child-actors. These kids do fairly well. Daniel Craig was advertised for being in the movie very heavily, and was displeased with his general lack of screen-time. To be fair, he wasn't the main character but I was under the impression that he was very important, but had little time to prove it.My main complaint is that the movie is expectantly incomplete. I think it will benefit from multiple movies because for those of us unfamiliar with it all, we'd like to see how some of it ends.All in all, I give it around a 6-7 out of 10. 6.2 may seem a bit harsh as its average rating, but I think it might be a fair measure.

170,ukxenafan1,How to ruin a classic book!,3,2 January 2019,"Not sure who has to shoulder the lion's share of the blame for this damp squib of a film. The omens were good - terrific casting. Who could argue with Daniel Craig as Asriel and Nicole Kidman as Mrs Coulter and so many other great actors, well cast. One problem is Dakota Richards as Lyra who is pretty wooden but the main problem is the entire world of Pullman's novels is explained in voice over in the first seconds of the movie. Imagine Harry Potter explaining all the rules of magic, the reason Harry was special and the truth about Snape in the intro! Underestimating your audience, forgetting the world building and laying out the plot as if we were 5 year olds is insulting!In the books Lyra is pretty headstrong but here she is just obnoxious. The book is rich and almost Dickensian in its vast array of characters - but it's all so rushed in a 2 hour film.

I walked out and man was I fuc*ed off. Now I don't think I've seen a bad film in cinemas but for this...yeah there's a first time for everything. This movie was bad and i mean BAD. One of the worst movies I have ever seen. The plot was stupid and I'm not even going to put down my opinions on what I thought of dog-like girl in the movie. The ONLY good thing in this movie was the polar bear fight. I felt like I had paid 10 pounds for a cheeseburger that's been passed it's sell-by date for the past 6 months. The director must have been on a potent mix of class-A drugs and a large quantity of alcoholic beverages. My god man...1/10 is a luck rating for this piece of trash.,The Golden Compass

Lyra goes on a mission to the North to rescue him with the help of her Golden Compass, a device which will answer any question she would ever ask. Sadly, Dakota fails at adding the spice which made up the character of Lyra.Nichole Kidman, still trying to come out of a five year movie slump does play the perfect Ms. Coulter, but in another failed attempt of a movie. Daniel Craig as well was amazing in this movie, but we just don't see enough of him to consider him to have any big role.I wasn't expecting much from the movie after I read the book. For some reason, the writers got smart and decided to end the movie right after the big battle... what happened to golden ending of the book when Lord Asriel killed Roger? Because of the ending, the writers never really told us what happened with the floating city and the ""Dust"". Since there won't be a sequel, two major questions was brought up and will never be answered.A big part of the book which I enjoyed was Iorek Byrnison and Farder Coram's characters... and the movie ruined them! Iorek was supposed to be a fierce bear who crushed heads and killed under his own demand. Course to keep this movie PG rated, it couldn't show the bear ritual of when Iorek defeated Iofur and tore open his stomach and ate his heart. Sure a morbid part of the book, but still this showed character. Farder Coram was the secondary character in the book, but the movie practically switched Farder Coram's and Lee Scoresby's role.But sure, with every let down there could also be great parts, just like with the final battle scene. My eyes were glued to the screen because it was done very well.Overall, this movie was a disappointment. I am sure I can find many other parts to pick about - keep your money, don't see this movie.",The Golden Compass
173,karl_with-12,"Started off as dull, cheesy and cliché but then admitted itself to be quite interesting",7,4 December 2009,"I had no ""raging"" desires to see this movie once it aired in my country. However that did not stop me from watching it once it finally premiered on TV.Evidently, a film with glimmering showbiz stars like Daniel Craig + Nicole Kidman is going to be quite interesting. We've seen them individually in action films like 007 (Daniel obviously) and sappy romantic films, but have we ever actually seen them on a fantasy perspective film? And speaking of fantasy this links to my valid expectations of 'The Golden Compass': a Narnia-stylised fantasy film. And was I right? Yes, you could say it sustains all that but it also delivers the true essence of it but on the other hand - that doesn't mean it's THAT good...The first 15-20 minutes of the film, I admit, was lame. And by that I mean dull. Dull because the first few minutes of the film introduced the fantasy genre in a very chEEsy way - plus it was all in narration! I also think this film was quick paced. Such as after the boring ""story-telling"" at the beginning, it then quickly buzzed into the action. And there are loads of cut-scenes. In every scene it's like a different event happening and when it's over, it just fast forwards itself to another scenario without even letting to film blend into the scene transformations on its own manner.On the other hand, with the start being a let-down, the film starts to redeem its influence (well, that happened when we really started getting into the adventure.) It FINALLY started to deliver on a fantasy genre level. And I admit, it turned out to be a heck of a ride. The film introduced its other main characters (eg;- Orik the bear), its adventure and moreover - its enjoyment. So all in all, the second half of the movie + its climax actually turned out to be quite good.However the ending looms into the films negatives. It seemed that the film was left unfinished. After that amazing climax - everything just went down so fast. Overall it turned out to be a poor ending. What a silly disappointment Are they gonna make the Golden Compass 2? (I hope so.) Because the film just left itself and the audience with unanswered mystery questions...Well enough about the story, lets go on to the performances;- Dakota Blue Richards: She started off surprisingly bland, but then as the film progresses, she started to progress herself and it really showed her true ""acting colours"". Overall she is a talented actress who has a bright film future ahead of her.Daniel Craig + Nicole Kidman: Although I said the action was going to be ""interesting"": But to be honest, I expected better acting from them. I was disappointed to see that Daniel wasn't in the film much and Nicole turned out to be just a vague ""evil person"". Overall their performances were okay but nothing more than than that...And as for the other actors/actresses, they were good as well. But I have to say that Dakota was the heart of the movie.OVERALL: A film which starts off as incredibly dull, cheesy and quick but once we got into the action it got quite interesting but it just couldn't hold that for the ending point. + this film was a bit cliché. It mainly relies on special effects, scene setting and props to give it its title (which links to the cheesiness). But it was a rather okay, enjoyable fantasy.FINAL RATING: 7.2/10",The Golden Compass
174,flyingamon,Movie is much better than the rating suggests,8,16 April 2011,"I'm devastated at the rating that this movie gets but than again I seem to have a pretty much different taste than the majority of the raters here. I don't see what problem they could have with the movie. If they don't like the story or think it's poorly done well than I can understand their reasoning. If they however loathe this movie for being anti-religious than I say to them stay away from it. I don't see this movie as propaganda against religion though even if the clergy does come out as the bad ones here. I don't think they should be hypocrite as we all know that both government and the church have done some really dark stuff to the population. And its' still happening today. But I don't think the movie is about that. It's a really enchanting story. I loved the idea of every human having a daemon, some kind of animal they could talk to sharing their feelings and pain. The movie was also very nice in visuals with the beautiful snow landscapes as a good example. I think that the young Dakota Blue Richards did a really good job playing the young hero girl Lyla. She doesn't seem to have that stardom aura over her like other child actresses or actors and I hope to see her in more movies of this kind. I was happy to see her in Secret of Moonacre giving another good performance there. Unfortunately we are not going to see her again in sequels of The Golden Compass. They are not planning to make any sequels for unclear reasons (one says didn't make enough money other say bad reception of the critics but I do hope it's the first reason). As I'm desperate to know how the story goes on I need to hope for a mini series or find some time and willingness to read the books. The story kept me enthralled all the time even if some things seemed kind of rushed and unexplained. I wished for some more background from the witches for example. But that however is only a small complaint. I also wanted to say that I loved Nicole Kidman in here, beautiful woman but playing such a split personality that you both love and hate her at the same. Every movie I saw her in she never disappoints me. If you love fantasy and good adventure I certainly recommend this one.",The Golden Compass
175,RodMartinJr,A classic in every sense of the word,10,16 October 2017,"This is one of those rare films that has everything a good film demands -- conflict, juicy characters, understandable story that connects to the audience viscerally, and stunning visuals. The music, acting, sets, props and dialog are all a work of art.This is the kind of film I would like to make. It creates a myth and universe that remains internally consistent. One other reviewer commented that someone would have to have read the books to understand the beginning of the movie. I disagree. I didn't read any of the books and loved this movie right from the first scene. The key is trusting the audience to suspend their disbelief as well as the need to know all of the backstory in order to enjoy the immersion process.This film works on so many levels -- creating a multi-layered conflict, including likable characters who have hidden agendas.If they don't make the sequels, I'll be upset, big time. Stopping the sequels because the first didn't make money in the USA (while making a killing overseas) is not a reason, but an excuse.",The Golden Compass
176,conradcarlo_venzon-1,"Not Bad, Simply Not Bad",6,10 December 2007,"The trailers of this movie is simply moving and it has moved me to watch this movie on the first day that it aired on the wide screen.This movie is somewhat a mediocre-type-of-movie. I mean, don't get me wrong but, there's something missing in this fantasy movie and I don't really know what.. Is it the story? The Plot? I don't know, I just feel something is missing. But a grade of 6 out of 10 is all I can give. I'm not a big-critic or any kind of those but hmm... in my life, I spend 60% of it watching movies and just the thought of another fantasy-filled-movie really gets me to go to a movie theater. Now, it's the casts, I don't know how it works in the book but the adults are barely in this. Nicole Kidman has the most significant work, ow and did I mention that she's still HOT-AS-HELL? Sam Elliott, even though he's kind of a late arrival, is a great presence once he's around.However Daniel Craig and Eva Green are barely in it and Christopher Lee has one blink-and-you'll miss him in a scene. Green is a suitably hot witch and Craig makes an impact in his one/two dialogue scenes early on which, along with a couple of wordless inserts of his storyline, put him enough into your mind to wonder about him. Kidman is perfect. There's something indelibly creepy about her rigid manner that works for the elegant but sinister Marisa Coulter. Dakota Blue Richards is a great find as Lara Belacqua. Now, the voice-only cast Ian McKellen is a perfect choice for the honorable polar bear while Highmore is either getting less annoying or it's just beneficial not being able to see him, as he is nicely understated as Pan. The effects are good but not great. I find that they should have put more mythical-type of music to make it more... powerful("",) and more entertainingNow, my favorite part!!! A big fight scene between polar bears and the end battle are suitably exciting and i found myself really entertained.

That's all folks!",The Golden Compass
177,motta80-2,"Really fun, engaging and fast moving fantasy spectacle",8,28 November 2007,"I went in cynical about this, especially after the travesty that was the Narnia film, but i was quickly converted: it's great fun. A really entertaining and immersive film that intelligently builds a fantastical world that the uninitiated can marvel and thrill in. I have to say i haven't read the books so can't comment on a book to film comparison.On the cast, I don't know how it works in the book but the adults are barely in this. Nicole has the most significant work and Sam Elliott, while a late arrival, is a great presence once he's around. However Daniel Craig and Eva Green are barely in it and Christopher Lee has one blink-and-you'll miss him scene. That said the casting is excellent. Green is suitably witchy and Craig makes an impact in his one/two dialogue scenes early on which, along with a couple of wordless inserts of his storyline, put him enough into your mind to wonder about him. He feels set up for a more significant role in future instalments. Elliott is great. That sonorous voice sneaking out from underneath that bushy moustache feels exactly right for Lee Scorsby.Kidman is perfect. There's something indelibly creepy about her rigid manner that works for the elegant but sinister Mrs Coulter. Meanwhile Simon McBurney is magnificently slimy and loathsome as the magisterium main face. You know he's a villain from the moment he enters frame.Dakota Blue Richards is a great find as Lara. While the first two Potter films and Lion, the Witch & the Wardrobe were significantly hampered by the incredibly mannered, unrealistic, wooden acting of the young leads (most of the Potter cast got better, time will tell on Narnia) Richards is a winner from the outset. Precocious and feisty without seeming too forced she is generally believable whether is her rebellion or her loyalty. This is just as well as the film is really entirely on her shoulders. It will work or not for people based on whether you like her. She's in virtually every scene and has a lot of different emotions to get across as well as having to have significant interaction with CGI creations like her spirit animal Pan (the ubiquitous Freddie Highmore) and the polar bear played by Ian McKellen. She has a couple of slightly actorly moments but does incredibly well for a first timer under this kind of pressure.Of the voice-only cast McKellen is a perfect choice for the honourable polar bear while Highmore is either getting less annoying or it's just beneficial not being able to see him, as he is nicely understated as Pan. My only note on this casting would be once or twice I couldn't tell is Lyra or Pan was speaking in their interaction as in quiet moments Highmore and Richards' voices are remarkably similar!The effects are good but not great. I had worried they'd be as weak as Narnia and they aren't. The world is beautifully created and always feels real, whether Scorsby's flying ship or the blimp thing from the trailer, or stunning Arctic landscapes and big cities. The smaller creatures are also brilliantly rendered, Pan in particular. Some of the bigger creatures are less perfect. The polar bears have a cartoony unreal feel but in a fantasy setting with battle armour and stuff they work well enough. Certainly better than Aslan in Narnia. However the leopard creature with Daniel Craig doesn't look right at all.As for the film itself it really zips along quickly. The uninitiated (like me) may occasionally lose track of what's going on early on as strange terms and names are thrown back and forth but it soon settles down and makes sense. Rather than frustrating me that I might be missing key elements of what this world was about I felt happy going with it and was left thinking I'll watch it again when it's released just to be sure I didn't miss anything. It's a relief to see a fantasy film that brings it in at almost exactly two hours and has a cracking momentum, as opposed to the seemingly endless drag of Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and Narnia. Don't get me wrong taking time can work. I really liked Fellowship of the Ring but the pace of the Potters really tests my patience. Golden Compass moves so fast before you know it it's over and it leaves you wanting more. Indeed at the end of this film I could say it had succeeded in doing something the Potter franchise has never done: it left me desperate to see the next one.However what really made me like this film more than those others is the tone and some of the things they do in it. There are moments in this, that i won't spoil for those like me who didn't know the plot, that really surprised me that they'd do in a family film.A big fight scene between polar bears and the end battle are suitably exciting and i found myself really invested. I cared about the characters. Whereas in Narnia they hadn't done enough to make you care about Aslan's fate (criminal given how effectively the book and the 80s BBC TV serial managed it) this really has you on the edge of your seat for the good guys.Overall I really liked Golden Compass and would give it an 8/10  compared to LOTR 10/10, 9/10, 7/10 for the series, Potter 5/10, 6/10, 8/10, 7/10, 7/10 for the series and Narnia 4/10. I will be watching this again when it comes out (something I never did for Potter or Narnia) and am looking forward to the next instalment. I hope Daniel Craig and Eva Green get bigger roles in the next film, but all round a great start to a potential franchise that I had middling hopes for.",The Golden Compass
178,lucasaq-1,"Disappointing, Yet Enjoyable",6,2 December 2007,"I went in with mixed feelings, hearing that this was a controversial film with veiled themes from the novel being feared by the Church and such. I went because it looked to be the most fantasy fun ""cold"" film of the Christmas Season. I was disappointed. It was a variety of things but mostly the over hyping by the ads which compare it to Lord of the Rings which is just not smart considering it isn't very epic like at all. It is under 2 hours which to start off a supposed deep trilogy was quite disappointing with not enough setup being allowed and the film feeling a quick movie action film with short scenes of development and a lot of action. It was just confusing and unsatisfying in that sense. Nothing made all that much even on later thought of trying to put stuff together. Most of all I would have to say the ending left a lot to be desired as it felt like it was leaving too much undone.The story revolves around a little girl, Lyra, whose relationship to another key figure is still quite murky at the end with so many questions flying, but she seems to be set to be in the middle of action managing to sneak into places where she should not. She also seems having a bunch of hidden guardians. Many points of the story do not make much sense. It seems the filmmakers were going from the child's perspective hinting at stuff that does not make sense. We left like the child Lyra with the pieces still far off and unlike Lyra with little understanding of this world. I guess that partly works, but it was not satisfying as I felt not enough was explained to let myself be able to let go enough to get into the story properly. It was the lack of development that really frustrated me, quick explanations by a narrator at the beginning is not quite enough to help us understand what exactly is going on. Everything becomes muddled and makes one question the structure of the film.I will say a few positive things for the film though. The young actress playing Lyra was quite convincing and strong one of the best child performances I have seen since probably Pan's Labyrinth, but that is not enough to save the film for me with the story being as it is. The other point is the special effects specifically the polar bears who are quite ferocious and have one of the best and clearest story lines of the whole film. That was very strong point of the film and made it quite enjoyable.Overall the film is disappointing and yet enjoyable as it offers good action and a few strong performances and effects, but at the cost of a strong overall film with an unsatisfactory conclusion and poor development. Kids will probably enjoy it and you can too, but just do not try to make too much sense of it all. If the sequel is indeed made maybe it will help, but this is not as strong of a foundation as I think they were going for.",The Golden Compass
179,rosian,Enjoyable but a very dumbed-down version of the book - a wasted opportunity,7,2 January 2008,"If you haven't read the books, you will probably enjoy this movie well enough and I'm sure children who haven't read the books will love it. But read the books and find what's almost a different story - surely even younger children will notice the differences?The main themes are the same, but gone are the dark overtones, the serious and adult aspect of much of the story. Lord Asriel, though brilliantly played by Daniel Craig who has shown what he can really do if allowed, after the disappointing Bond effort... Lord Asriel has lost all his mystery. You are supposed to wonder until late in the third book what he's up to, whether he's good or bad or what..... And we hardly see him. I wouldn't have cast Nicole Kidman as Mrs Coulter but she plays the part perfectly well so I am not disappointed. The worst changes are - first, that you are told right at the start by a voice-over for heaven's sake that you are in a different universe and you are told about the familiars, when you should need to take quite some time to work out why Oxford is so strange, the people are so strange, and what these animals are. I can't for a moment believe it was necessary to give away so much of the mystery at the start and it completely ruined the early part of the story for me. And second, that the story is badly dumbed down into ""just"" a little kiddies' story. It is no longer a dark, very serious as well as enthralling kidult story as in the books, nor mysterious nor very threatening.I don't call this a bad movie, nor a flop. But the film makers didn't it seems have the guts to make a movie that would reflect the book. I hope the further two movies will show more courage but my guess is they won't. The standard has been set too low in movie 1.",The Golden Compass
180,JoeC345,Better the Second Time,8,27 December 2010,"I remember watching when it first came out in theatre's and my first impression is apparently what a lot of the people who already reviewed this went with. I did not like it and that's mostly because during I was comparing it to other movies. However I watched it again the other day and was surprised how wrong my first impression was. This film is deeper then you would first think it was.If you agree or disagree with Pullman's novels is your choice I'm only here to give an opinion on Chris Weitz vision of the first book. In this respect this movie was a good entertainment. A lot of people seemed to think it was rushed and sloppy and couldn't disagree more. You have to remember it was the first book of a trilogy, usually that mean a lot of exposition.When you can make a movie this entertaining for younger viewers and still intriguing for adults you've definitely done something right. This is a movie where the kids will enjoy it but the parents will really be paying attention because the movie really does possess a lot of intriguing questions.Now I would feel terrible if I left out the performance of Dakota Blue Richards, this was her first role and you couldn't ask for a better one. I can see her having a rich career in the future. The rest of the performances are just as good containing the ever talented Daniel Craig and Ian McKellan. Since most people that want to see it already have all I ask is that for the rest of you give it a chance. I really hope they do the rest of the trilogy.",The Golden Compass
181,michaellaing71,A bad Adaptation of a great book,4,5 December 2007,"Why do Hollywood take successful books and they ruin them by changing the story. The Golden Compass starts as it means to go on, by ignoring much of the charm and interest of the books. Unfortunately as the film goes on the script gets worse. To it gets to a point where they swapped a huge part of the script around I suppose to make a bigger ending, but it just feels frustrating and leaves big plot holes.What made the film worse is that none of the characters feel truly developed and everything feels rushed. All this is down to Chris Weitz who has done a awful job of writing and directing the film. The acting is OK and whilst I feel that Dakota Blue Richards is OK in the part of Lyra, I feel that she was not directed well. None of the other character fair any better as characterisation is lost so that the story can be moved forward.Although at times the cinematography looks good at other time the lens used are bizarrely chosen. I also felt that the score of the film at time, didn't match and at time was annoying. The only real saving grace for the film is the special effects which are extreme good, it is just a pity everything else is so bad.",The Golden Compass
182,SebaZava,"Generic, not ambitious enough and boring.",6,10 December 2007,"The Golden Compass is an adequate yet lame fantasy film. The movie boasts some effective performances and cool-looking special effects, but it's too short, character development is virtually non-existent, the story feels too rushed, and the screenplay and the film as a whole fail to make audience believe in a new world and get used to new characters and themes. The Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings films and even the Narnia movie were more effective at presenting the viewer with a never-before-seen world and fantastic characters; The Golden Compass feels generic, not ambitious enough and, most surprisingly, kinda boring.So what are the problems that set this movie apart from other really great adventures such as the Lord of the Rings films? Firstly, there's the fact that I didn't get a sense of ""epicness"" or ambition while watching this movie, and this has to do both with Chris Weitz's (About a Boy) screenplay and direction. The story and the movie as a whole feel too rushed, with events happening real quickly and revelations taking place in the most unexpected occasions. (Such as the one that occurs during the film's climax.) With a duration of almost two hours, the film is not precisely short but, had it been about three hours long, the filmmakers would have had more time to develop the story and the characters. Yes, Dakota Blue Richard's Lyra is a pretty compelling protagonist, but her character isn't allowed time to breath; she never seems to change during the course of the movie, and the audience never truly learns anything about her. Additionally, Weitz's direction is lackluster and workmanlike, never really trying to use anything new or taking any risks to make the feel more interesting and cool to look at. The camera-work and the types of angles he uses feel too conventional for a film of this ilk, and the movie just never attains a sense of epic scope; it's kinda boring actually.The performances are all right, but they're nothing to rave about either. Dakota Blue Richards is effective as Lyra, creating an unusual protagonist for a movie of this sort - she's feisty and angry, instead of cute and pretty. Nicole Kidman as Mrs. Coulter is not bad either, making her character suitably evil and cold. She never gets the opportunity to shine, but she understands her character and makes an effective villainess. Daniel Craig doesn't get much screen time, and Derek Jacobi and Christopher Lee have very brief appearances as Magisterial officers. Ian McKellen as the voice of Iorek Byrnison is effective and creates a sense of authority, and Freddie Highmore as the voice of Pan is not as annoying as it could've been. Sam Elliott is delightful as Mr. Scoresby (his famous moustache gets a lot of screen time), and Eva Green is wasted as the Queen of the Witches (although her performance is not bad at all). Yes, the cast is full of stars and well-known thespians, but the majority of them don't have more than glorified cameos; the movie belongs to Blue Richards and Kidman, and they show ability to carry the movie's - rushed - plot.Technically, the film's all right, and after more than an hour of exposition, tons of dialogue, rushed scenes and non-existent character development, the movie attains some energy. The battle sequences look good (the fight between Iorek and another character I won't mention is pretty cool and serves magnificently as eye-candy) and the CGI is technically impressive but, although they might inject some energy to the proceedings, they never generate enough tension or become sufficiently entertaining. The film's final battle, which features kids, ""giptians"" (or whatever they're called) and flying witches is technically impressive, but never generated enough tension; it didn't engage me at all, especially because character interaction is virtually non-existent. The audience watches groups of characters fight in a dark scenery in the middle of the north pole, not the main protagonists risking their lives for some important aim. Additionally, the battle just ends... yes, with a big roar of the big, polar bear, but it's too sudden, and since the fighting itself has been pretty boring, I just didn't care when everyone stopped killing each other. Also, this movie features more or less the same problem as the Narnia movie: the battles are bloodless and told in a pretty clean, almost naive fashion. Given the PG-13 rating, the fights in this movie could have been a little more brutal, making the confrontations more engaging, interesting and believable.Ultimately, I wasn't impressed by The Golden Compass. Yes, the novels might be engaging, and might feature interesting, deep and philosophical ideas and themes, but the film adaptation of the trilogy's first volume is pretty boring. None of these ideas - not even the concepts of daemons and dust - are shown in a compelling fashion in the movie, and the fantasy world created by Pullman is presented to the audience in a lackluster and workmanlike manner. The performances might be good and the special effects might look cool, but the direction and screenplay are lame, the characters are too underdeveloped and the film as a whole is boring. Even the religious controversy is a faux - none of Pullman's atheist views and believes make it to the movie, which makes the story about people representing free will fighting against the forces of tyranny. I hope that, if Weitz and his team do adapt The Subtle Knife to the big screen - something which seems improbable now due to this movie's somehow disappointing performance at the American box office - they will manage to construct a more interesting, compelling and entertaining motion picture.",The Golden Compass
183,angelshalz,"Good enough but not great....can't become as good a legend as ""the lord of the rings""",6,18 July 2008,"The Golden Compass is good enough, but nothing amazing. The book was apparently written before the Lord of the Rings and my friend was complaining about how much worse it is. I suppose it depends on your opinion, but I found Lord of the Rings better. This movie plunges us viewers into another fictional dimension with a phenomenon about ""dust connecting worlds"" which is a bit confusing. The movie starts with a narration like in LOTR where they decide to shove the whole ""demon containing soul"" thing in our faces too quickly, so that it becomes a bit silly. Before I even processed and accepted the information, the movie got deep into the conflicts. My next complaint is that the cutting and scene editing is not as good as it should be. Sometimes a scene got introduced automatically after one got over. But there were definitely some pros. The Golden Compass is not at all boring. Nicole Kidman shines as the villain, while the girl (main character) did a fairly good job of being brave, stubborn and feisty. The polar bear is awesome and I'm sure kids will enjoy it. Don't have very high expectations though.",The Golden Compass
184,filmbuff20,"""It's just a little cut...""",7,5 December 2007,"Hyped by New Line Cinema as their new Lord of the Rings-style moneymaker, The Golden Compass is an adaptation of the first in a trilogy written by British Author Phillip Pullman and couldn't be further from the Rings trilogy or the Narnia books to which it is always compared. For a start, Pullman has been accused of promoting atheism, something that Tolkien and Lewis were clearly combating and this is the second book-to-film in as many years that has been attacked by the Church, the first being the Da Vinci Code which thrived because of the fuss, not because it was actually any good. Despite such controversy, the film will be taken as an entertaining fantasy by most viewers and does not deal directly with some of the more inflammatory issues of the books. The story takes place in a parallel universe only slightly different to our own in which the human soul is manifested as an animal known as a 'daemon.' The heroine is a young girl named Lyra who goes on a quest to rescue her kidnapped best friend from the sinister Oblation Board. The first thing to remember when going to see an adaptation of a book on the big screen is that books are not films. Films that are translated literally from their book counterparts run the risk of failing miserably. An example would be the aforementioned Da Vinci Code, a surprisingly dull affair given it's 'thriller' moniker. Thankfully, The Golden Compass does not fall prey to this, from the get go explaining all there is to know about this strange new world unfolding before the viewers' eyes before allowing them to settle into it. Put simply, this movie captures the essence of it's novel counterpart to a T. It's handling of the complex other world and it's societies is more or less faultless, even going so far as to explain more than the book does in some places. The special effects are grand and do not show obvious 'joins' like some other blockbusters using CGI of recent months. But this is not a CGI movie. This movie uses CGI to realise itself and that is commendable in this day and age of movies.The cast is comprised of some fine actors, such as Daniel Craig, underused in a role that could have been more (more on that later), Christopher Lee (whose fleeting appearance gets almost top billing in the end credits for some reason), with Ian McKellen and Ian McShane as Armoured Bears. The rest of the cast, Nicole Kidman as the cunning and evil Mrs Coulter, Eva Green as Serafina Pekkala of the Witch Clan and newcomer Dakota Blue Richards all fill out their roles nicely, the latter proving that not all child actors need to grate on the nerves. She shows fire and promise for the future and embodies Lyra.It takes a while to get going, but once invested in the world and it's idiosyncrasies, the viewer is transported, empathising with things that are new and original ideas, things the viewer would not necessarily understand had they not been handled correctly. There is a rush of elation during the battle scenes, the swell of the score, while not being particularly recognisable, causing the action to soar with emotional resonance countering other movies' action for action's sake (such as the recent Shoot Em Up, in which no-one could really care who lives or dies). The decision making for most departures from the book are, as mentioned earlier, pretty good. There is an additional scene involving Daniel Craig's character which is only hinted at in the book that provides him with an exciting 'Bond' moment and a switching around of certain scenes that does wonders for the pacing. Some others do not fare so well, for example, if our heroine Lyra gets across a chasm using a bridge that crumbles behind her, how do all of her adult companions make it over there later on to join her? Other things are scrapped, not in favour of the movie but obviously by rule of the studio, Hollywood being afraid of ambiguity or questionable character in their big money making summer blockbuster machines. This also serves to dampen the experience a little (for those who have read the book at least) in which an otherwise deep and richly thoughtful adaptation of an equally rich book is short changed by being slightly dumbed down. In relation to this, book fans will be crushed to find that the last few chapters have been excised in favour of a more upbeat ending. An unfortunate move on the part of the studio as this serves to dull the ending of the first film and convolute the beginning of the second. This also affects the overall structure of the film, Weitz having to change events around in order to accommodate it. Viewers unfamiliar with the books may notice that there is no payoff to speak of in act III leaving less of a reason to return for the sequel than if the original ending had been left alone.Director Chris Weitz does a fabulous job with the material despite the obvious studio interference, and hopefully he will be asked back to direct again, just maybe with a new screenwriter to tighten things up a bit. In all, an enjoyable film save for these minute, but in the long run heavy problems. One wonders if Mrs Coulter was actually in the editing room with her golden monkey, whispering sweetly in the editor's ear ""it's just a little cut...""",The Golden Compass
185,thebengalimafia-1,A Great Children's Film!,8,20 December 2007,"I don't know what it is about children's films that have surreal elements like flying ships and talking polar bears but it all just works better with a British cast. The Golden Compass is no different; the film is pure magic. It's no doubt darker in tone than other British films lately (Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings) and it also deals with some more serious issues than sorcerers and hobbits.The film is set in an alternate universe we are introduced to the Magesterium; the paragon of organized religion. All people in this universe have demons, small creatures that walk and talk and stay with people at all times. The demons of the children can shape shift whereas the demons of adults have a fixed form. The subject matter here can get a bit touchy for people. The Magesterium represents all organized religion and the demons represent the human soul and the soul's need to ask questions and seek the truth. The Magesterium has been trying to develop a technology to sever people from their demons so they won't ask questions. Because that's what organized religion wants, they don't want people to become too inquisitive and to be blindly obedient. The source of the questions that threaten the Magesterium seems to be the presence of ""dust"" in the universe. As Lyra (Dakota Blue Richards) says, ""There's plenty of regular dust all around."" But this magic dust as they say is coming from another universe. Since this proves that other universes exist, everything the Magesterium stands for is challenged. As a gentleman dressed all too much like a Catholic priest says in the film, ""For the sake of our children, we must proceed, it's the least we could do for their own good."" It's a bit much for a children's movie, but it all fits together beautifully. I just hope there aren't hordes of parents and religious folk demanding the film be banned. It really is entertaining, and Dakota Blue Richards makes it that much better. Nicole Kidman does a splendid job as Mrs. Coulter and she looks stunning in every scene of the film. One of the best things about the visual portion of the film is Mrs. Coulters flying blimp; a contraption that belongs only in stories like these but brings out the kid in you and makes you wish it were real.The real treat of the film for me was when Lyra has to recruit an armored snow bear by the name of Iorek Byrinson, voiced by Ian McKellen. There's a fight scene between him and the King of the Ice Bears that made me wonder how they passed this off as a G rated film with this much violence. The only downside to what I considered a great film is that the ending makes you realize you've watched the fist act of a much longer film; this will be a trilogy no doubt. I wouldn't be surprised if the second film starts exactly where the first one left off. And the Golden Compass wasn't as important in the film as the title would make you think. Overall, this was a welcome end of the year surprise, and I can't wait for the sequel.",The Golden Compass
186,MattDevivre,things to learn from this picture...,5,9 December 2007,"...but only if you are interested in how to deliver a story or how to translate a book into a movie and therefore ""Golden Compass"" is a fantastic example how you should NOT do it ! In some ways it feels like those ""Terminator in 60 seconds"", ""Aliens in 60 seconds"" animation shorts you can find online: Action follows action and phrase follows phrase while explanations are replaced by coincidence or left behind. The same holds true for ""The Golden Compass"". After a while I decided to stop having any expectations about what's happening right before my eyes - I turned off thinking and just watched without entering any fiction. So you might say I had a pretty much empty movie experience. Director Chris Weitz created a film that in my point of view is not able to include it's audience.In my opinion movies must focus on important aspects of a story - which is one crucial difference to literature were writers tell their stories in a more dissipated manner. However stories like ""The Golden Compass"" need long breath - time for explanation, time to deliver the feeling of a certain world. Perhaps a fantasy world needs more exposition than any ordinary movie world - if that is so too much compression is even more risky when you're doing this genre. If you don't feel acquainted to the fantasy world it's will be difficult to dive in the story telling. So if such a picture needs three hours, it needs that long. If there's no money to make it three hours, just don't do it. On no account 110 minutes can be enough to make ""The Golden Compass"" - if you don't believe it, watch this movie. Also the computer animations fail to convince - some impressions resemble a computer game (reminded me of the computer adventure game ""Syberia""). Finally a few words about the acting of Kidman, Craig and the others - you can't possibly say if it's good or bad cause it's pretty hard to form a stable impression of the characters, if you don't know the book cause there are too many questions left unanswered ! In a short: Sometimes it's better to tell a little too much than too little. Not worth the money and if you really really wanna see it, do yourself a favor and wait for the DVD (trust me: it won't look better in cinema - the cinematography is not very good).",The Golden Compass
187,vicdragon19-1,doens't hold a candle to the book....,6,10 January 2008,"I was desperate to read the novel before i took in the film, and i'm glad i did because the film doens't capture Phillip Pullman's magic that draws you into another world. The film tells how there are other worlds connected in the universe, and how in the main character's world, Lyra, their souls can be seen in the form of animals, known as demons (goood things). Lyra is given a golden compass by her master in an Oxford school that tells the truth when you ask it something. She learns of a sinister plan that will effect the lives of many children that is very disturbing to her.What was really rich about the novel was how the characters connected really well with one another. Iorek Byrnison, for example, the polar bear, i felt didn't' really connect with Lyra as in the novel, and Lyra, played by Dakota Blue Richards i felt didn't really have the warmth to actually admire her in the film. Nicole Kidman was effective as the icy villain, and Eva Green should have had more appearances. The film was rather rushed and the ending was absolutely done badly. Though the film does slightly contradict the ways of the church, it should have been emphasized more because that is what the novels do. I never understand the Church and their criticisms of everything, but it wouldn't really hurt to have films that are given free speech.Overall, the visuals are gorgeous, special effects quite good but not enough to draw you in.",The Golden Compass
188,schak23,was looking forward but felt disappointed,3,13 December 2007,"Unquestionable it's useless to compare a book and it's film adaptation. But with ""Northern Lights"" and the movie ""The Golden Compass"" it appears to be different to me. I enjoyed the book enormously and liked the atmosphere, the characters and the way Pullman created a world so rich of emotions, motives, ideas and thoughts. I would say that a film is able to do the same, but that's exactly what I missed while watching ""The Golden Compass"". The film looked like a trailer for an extended version to be released on DVD in maybe half a year or shortly before Easter holidays. There is no time for anything deep or touching in this movie although they have an extraordinary cast and production team for cinematography, sound and special effects. Sorry, but such a poor script and directing especially in the final process of the production when it comes to create a coherent piece is really disappointing (Or maybe poor Chris Weitz for being under such a pressure? Who knows). Uninspired Hollywood blockbuster-ism seems to come to it's end, hopefully. Sequels, Prequels and flat exploitation of fantastic ideas. Therefore I have to compare a book and a movie in matter of what I'm enjoying. Call me a goat then but I probably get myself ""The Subtle Knife"" and start reading...",The Golden Compass
189,Movie-Jay,"Oh, what a great movie!",10,12 December 2007,"I seriously don't understand why this movie isn't connecting with some people. It finished well at the box office on it's first weekend, but besides that point, what a great movie! I knew nothing about the story beforehand. I like Hollywood films, documentaries, indies, foreign films, whatever. I love fantasy/adventure movies, but I usually like them when there is more than just the escape factor. I liked the Harry Potter series; but it's all fun escape and whimsy. I was not a lover of the LOTR series. I felt that those movies were really, really long B movies that they kept trying to pass over on us as qualified A movies because of way too much emphasis on meaningful moments and melodrama and self-importance.The Golden Compass, for me, rises above the rest because it's not only a swift and fantastic adventure film, but it's really about something. It's for everyone, not just kids. I think most of the negative reviews I've read are just wrong and cynical. And I think that's because so many people think that religion and politics should not be brought up in an ""entertainment"". The underlying themes of many reviews is, ""Please don't make us think!"", and that's too bad because this is clearly one of the best movies of the year.First, it's a beautiful movie to watch and I like that the use of special effects are effective and efficient without being too good, if you know what I mean. Having said that though, there are sequences and little moments that leave you breathless, like when Lyra's daemon embodies a rat and races down a table, jumps off, and quickly morphs into a butterfly when Lyra's got to hide in a closet. And I especially loved the idea of the ""daemons"" and how they are used in the movie as a sort of sub-conscience and a close confidant of the characters, especially the children, who are precisely at an age where they demand truth and ask big questions and are beginning to flirt with the power of their free will.Some have said that movie rushes along too quickly. I'm glad for that. This movie is very economical, and it leaves you grasping at points, but I love it because it isn't aware of itself. Unlike LOTR, it has no idea that it's really about epic themes. The characters simply move along, following their values and acting upon their natures.I was in heaven when the song that plays over the end credits was written and performed by Kate Bush. It clearly reminds us of some of those great songs from other adventure films like Annie Lennox's song in Bram Stroker's Dracula, Tina Turner from Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, and that song for the Never Ending Story.Dakota Blue is a find. She's smart and precocious, never poses or panders to us, and fills out the role superbly. It came as a surprise to me how much I was choked up several points in the film when she extends empathy to one of the character's in particular, when she could have chosen to just move on, and how she expresses gratitude in a late scene in the movie.Read the bad reviews, and then read the good ones, and then go see this movie for yourself. It'll entertain and thrill you, but more than that, it will curiously conjure up feelings of your youth. Exhilarating!",The Golden Compass

After that he should be locked in a cage with a real, hungry polar bear. The plot has been dumbed down and looks to be designed by committee. Several people have clearly read the book and picked scenes they think should be in the movie and dumped the rest in the bin. While the book was an epic this 'lite' version just seems too short. It isn't exactly like the film's too long. At just 113 minutes there was at least another 30 minutes before it'd be uncomfortably long. The quick pace should have given the story spring, but with the characters seemingly just jumping around the globe with no real good explanation it doesn't feel right.Daniel Craig as Lord Asriel is probably the best thing in the film, all twenty minutes he's on screen. Dakota Blue Richards as Lyra is an amazing find and clearly has a great future in front of her in movies. Sadly she could have done with a better starting point. Kidman as Marisa Coulter is stunningly beautiful, but as the main villain doesn't quite have the sinister punch needed.CGI was obviously the only way to create the daemons (the persons soul manifested as an animal companion) and this works well. The scenery and brilliant cinematography save this from being one of the few 1/10 movies I've rated on here.To sum up: a shockingly poor effort at what should have been the building block for a great franchise.

191,camelot2302,Not bad but not brilliant either.,6,6 December 2007,"After the emotional devastation of seeing Eragon being gutted in the movies, I went to ""The Golden Compass"" expecting the same kind of wholesale slaughter. I mean, how can you possibly capture the essence and spirit of Phillip Pullman's book with all the allegory, the politics, the religion, the whole back-story, and still make it a movie for all moviegoers of all ages, within a 2 hour time frame? Pullman himself said he was very happy with the movie so that reassured me somewhat.After going to see it, here are my observations : 1) The casting was spot-on. I don't recall any actor who provoked a ""oh hell, what is he / she doing in the movie?"" reaction.2) As one previous reviewer said, the director has turned Pullman's story from a hard gritty thought-provoking story into a cuddly family movie. The whole heart of the plot has been gutted - the religion & politics has been strongly toned down to the point where Derek Jacobi comes across as Darth Vader on the Death Star and Lyra is Princess Leia. In other words, an unoriginal ""good versus evil"" story. Yawn.3) How did they persuade Christopher Lee to take on a role that involved only one scene and two lines? That guy doesn't get out of bed for anything less than a Jedi Knight or a Lord of the Rings. He was tragically underused! 4) I'm in two minds about the computer CGI. On one hand, it managed to conjure up some great scenes and special effects. On the other hand, it did get in the way sometimes to the detriment of the movie. When the Tartars turned up at Bolvanger, that was pure PC games graphics! 5) If you've read the book, you'll notice that in the movie they CHANGED THE ENDING! At the end of the book, Asriel is about to cross into the parallel world and he begs Mrs Coulter to go with him. She refuses but Lyra and Roger jump through instead. There the book ends. This is NOT in the movie! But a friend told me that it was in the movie trailer. So did someone do a last minute change to the movie ending?? Overall, not a bad movie. I was expecting a slaughter and instead got a friendly skirmish. It is also generally faithful to the book. Just don't expect a masterpiece.",The Golden Compass

The one facet to ignore is that which tries to comment on things in our world (the writer's delusions). Drivel that is, but without it, this movie shines as a beacon of great inspiration even with the moments of poor CGI.Based on the novel Northern Lights by Philip Pullman (who publicly supported the changes from his novel).Overprotective parents may find it a little dramatic for their young'uns, but it is a family film to be sure.

193,enazwo,Polished Mediocrity,6,3 December 2007,"When the movie starts out explaining the whole ""dust"" deal it was a little flimsy and forced for me, as I kept thinking to myself, ""Yeah I know this is an alternate reality, but 'Dust?' I mean so what do they call the stuff they sweep up off their floors?"" I know I'm reading too much into it. I'm sorry I did not read the books so I was dependent on the movie to provide enough supporting details so that I could get a handle on the plot. Unfortunately I was spoiled with the LotR's FotR, where there was a very visually powerful, excellent narrative to explain the premise of the story.Yet there were many things to like about the movie, for me personally it is always a pure pleasure to watch Nicole Kidman, I have been a fan of hers since Moulin Rouge and The Others. Kidman's talents are self evident. However the movie just doesn't take off for me.Let me say that Sam Elliot can certainly brighten up any film. It was an odd dichotomy with Mr. Elliot's western genre charm in a sci/fi fantasy setting. How could this of worked I asked myself. I didn't let it concern me none too much and just went with it as I really liked his character in this.The anti religious tones that people have been making a fuss over, are really kind of deeply buried in allegory and metaphors here. So I guess you'd really have to be determined to find them, so I wouldn't let that ruckus play a role in determining to see this movie. As for solely movie entertainment it is well done, but for me it just doesn't have that chemistry or magic like when I saw FotR where I had gone out the next day to see FotR again, and again.",The Golden Compass
194,mgoldhamer,The Golden Compass: a lustrous pathway to the truth,8,12 December 2007,"The Golden Compass gives the power of truth to the proper user on a journey to set her world on it's true course. Sounds rather simple and straight forward, does it not? But there are hidden forces who do not want the truth to be known by the citizens of the republic, and they will go to extreme lengths to prevent this from happening. So sets into motion a wondrous voyage of a little girl, (Dakota Blue Richards) an armored polar bear, (voiced by Iam McKellen) a cowboy balloonist, (Sam Elliott) her father, (Daniel Craig) and an evil woman. (Nicole Kidman) Hollywood has often taken sides on political and social issues and this is just as true with this film. The current war that our present political administration is insisting, that must be won, by changing the people of another country to a Democatic form of government, like our own, is no different than part of the plot of this film. Freedom of choice is also a large part of the theme of this excellent film. You and I have an inner conscious mind that we can talk too on occasion and discuss questions at a moments notice, which we take for granted. We call this our 'Ego' but suppose our Ego was three dimensional, which is the exact case of the people in the Parallel Universe where this film takes place. Chirs Weitz who directed and wrote the screenplay has given his audience a lot to think about. This is only part one with two more episodes to follow. The film is based on the three novels written by Philip Pullman. A family quality film with a certain amount of controlled violence, but no blood and guts.

195,deltajuliet,A Good Film Adaptation of a Great Book,7,7 December 2007,"The Golden Compass is a good film adaptation of a great book. Director Chris Weitz does an impressive job combining storytelling with CGI, but I don't think he fully realized the totality of potential that this project had.The Golden Compass follows the story of young Lyra (newcomer Dakota Blue Richards) on her exploits across the Europe of an alternate reality. Her trip initially starts when Marisa Coulter, played by a delightfully villainous Nicole Kidman, invites her to come to the ""North"" as an assistant. However, Lyra quickly sees Coulter for what she is and escapes. Eventually, Lyra meets up with a warrior bear voiced by Ian McKellen (more on him later), an ""aeronaut cowboy"" played by the perfectly-cast Sam Elliot, and a not-so-wicked witch named Serafina Pekkala (Eva Green), and goes on an adventure to stop an atrocity I'll leave for the movie to explain.Condensing the rather long novel into a movie is impressive, but I would have gone for something more along the lines of a 3-hour epic; The Golden Compass, however, clocks in at only 113 minutes. I've heard that all-CGI movies tend to be shorter just because every frame is expensive to make, and the more frames there are the more you have to pay. While The Golden Compass isn't Toy Story, I'm almost wondering if the extensive amount of CGI was the reason it was so short (although with a $250 million budget, you'd think money wouldn't be an issue...). I say it's short because there was scarcely enough time for the story arc to finish, and furthermore, the amount of story that they included was actually less than I thought it'd be. Needless to say, I didn't think there was enough time for things like character development - all the things that could make a good movie great. Another problem with it's short running time is that a bunch of the stuff I saw in the ads aren't even in the movie. I mean, seeing a clip or two in a trailer that don't make the final cut isn't a big thing, but there were some pretty significant things from the trailer and other ads that weren't in this movie. When it ended and I hadn't seen them, I was like, ""WTF? It's over!?!?"" It turns out that they cut the ending of the book, even though they had filmed it, because test audiences who were unfamiliar with the story didn't understand what was happening. I really want to emphasize how cheated I feel by this. Since they pretty much omitted the story's climax, there wasn't nearly enough closure, save an inspirational monologue delivered by Lyra meant only to leave audiences on a high note. Also, Daniel Craig, known to many as the new Bond, disappears about a third of the way into the movie and doesn't come back. It's clear that they plan to have a sequel and to have Craig be in the sequel, but Craig's a cool guy, and I would have liked to have seen more of him in this movie.One of my favorite aspects of the story and the movie is daemons. For those new to The Golden Compass universe, a daemon (pronounced ""demon"") is a representation of a person's soul. It manifests itself as an animal that mirrors the person's personality. A servant's daemon, for example, would be a dog. Before coming of age, a person's daemon is able to change into any animal, reflecting the not-yet-set personality of a child. To me, daemons are fascinating. They're you, but they're also their own physical entity. They feel your pain. They can talk. And yet, I don't think Weitz handled daemons as well as he could have. It would have been really interesting to learn what daemons are all about, to hear the conversations that they have with their counterparts, to really get into their heads. What we get in the movie fell short of that, I think. Mostly it's just Lyra's daemon, Pan, saying things like ""I don't think we should go in there"" or ""I'm scared."" The little bit of insight we get is fascinating, but that's just the problem, it's only a little bit of insight.Another issue I had was that of violence. Part of the story involves warrior bears. The primary one we get to know is Iorek Byrnison. Iorek is one bad mofo, and we see just how cool he is in a fight to the death with another bear who stole the kingship of the bears from Iorek. If I remember the book correctly, this part had lots of blood and ended with Iorek eating the heart of the other bear. Nothing says ""badass"" like a blood-drenched warrior bear eating the heart of his slain opponent. But alas, I don't recall there being blood anywhere in the movie and, sadly, no hearts were eaten. I understand that this movie is aimed partially at a young audience, but they could have pushed it a little; as it is, it's pretty tame.Don't get me wrong, I'm going on about how the movie could have been better, but I'm only explaining what I think would have made the movie something as truly great as the novels. As it is, it's still a good and entertaining movie that's worth the money. I'd recommend it, but just don't have your hopes too high.7/10",The Golden Compass
196,Twilight_Wraith,"Should have been called ""The movie where nothing happens""",1,9 December 2007,"There's been a lot of controversy surrounding this movie. Well let me tell you right now the only controversy you should be concerned with is how bad this movie is. The story surrounds a young woman named Lyra, who agrees to travel in an airship with Nicole Kidman. Now, not only is Nicole Kidman's character one of the creepiest in the history of cinema, she's also psycho and hates when little girls still wear their hand bags in the house. The focus on Lyra really hurts the movie, as she is stereotypical and completely predictable. The young lady that portrays her is better than Jake Lloyd, but that's not saying much. Anyways, we meet some characters, some more characters, and each time new ones join it's like we have to sit through 5-10 more minutes of unnecessary and expository dialog that has no bearing on the story itself. In short, the movie wastes too much time with ancillary details and quickly loses focus on the story, only to take us on a very boring journey. You know what my Golden Compass is telling me? It's telling me ""Stay away from this movie!""",The Golden Compass
197,nbwritersinbox,The Golden Turkey..?,5,10 February 2011,"I have to wonder what Mr Pullman made of this film? In the unlikely event he ever reads this review, I'd be interested to know...As book adaptations go, this one ranks as weak. The screenplay sprints along, as if too afraid to pause for breath. Brutal editing manages to suck any mystery out the narrative. Talented performances from Sam Elliot, Ian McKellen, and Tom Courtenay (no less) cannot rescue mediocrity, disappearing in a whirlwind of CGI and less than sure-footed direction.Craig and Kidman are miscast, recruited no doubt, due to an atypical ""hollywood belief"" that their presence adds ""box office appeal"". Such an obvious studio ploy does not lead to great and memorable cinema. Craig is reduced to a gruff appendage and is far more at home in straight action films. Kidman is efficient, but lacks flair.Controversially, I'm also suggest Pullman's writing is a little over-rated. The central, yet ephemeral idea of ""dust"" lacks weight, whilst setting stories in university towns with young female protagonists lack originality. The book's characters are, no doubt, better drawn, but in literary terms, we're not in the company of figures like J K Rowling, C S Lewis, or indeed, Tolkien.Everything in this film has a repackaged feel. Commerce over art is never that exciting.",The Golden Compass

200,MarkSaltzer,Truly Wonderful,10,12 August 2008,"I didn't read the book, blessing me with an open mind to the film. It captured my imagination, the cast, the direction, the effects, superbly performed and executed. The story was fantastic, well portrayed and had moments that inspired me. Unlike most films these days, The Golden Compass, was truly remarkable.The animation of the animals was impeccable and a step further than the original Chronicles of Narnia movie. To those of you who wrote it off after reading the book first, books are books, you can put them down and go to the bathroom without effecting the storyline, a movie is to be delivered with no toilet break, and The Gold Compass, although being 2 hours long, filled my satisfaction meter with 100% Pure Dust, and my bladder remained in tact.The message I took away from the film was this, don't let the corrupt and mind dumbing authorities take away your freedom to dream, imagine and create. Oh, and teachers, leave them kids alone, although that is not true, without teachers where would we be. But I guess Pink Floyd wouldn't have had a hit if they replaced the word teachers with Magisterium Scientists.

201,isabelle-frater,"Rushed, but worth watching, if not for Nicole Kidman",5,28 October 2016,"I saw the movie several years ago on TV. I couldn't really remember it now, but I did like it, and have wanted to read the book several times ever since. I've been running about a lot nowadays, and I love listening to audiobooks. I have had the audiobooks for quite some time, and this was the perfect opportunity to listen to them, so I did. Once I was done with the first book, a rewatch of the movie was in order.This movie didn't do well in the box office. Some blame it on the religious theme of the story, others on it not being a very good movie. I quite liked it, though now that I know what they worked from, I can see the problems. For a discussion on the story itself, please read my book review.The story didn't change much. They did merge a few characters, as it sometimes happens. What was strange was the introduction of the councillors and the Magisterial Emissary. It is remarked in the books that the Magisterium dictates a lot of things, and is half supporting Mrs Coulter, but it is her eagerness for power, which drives the negative events, not the Magisterium, as it appears in the movie. Or so it was my understanding as I read the book. I did wonder why they made it out so, but I couldn't see any justification for it. Maybe more will be revealed int he following books. Another change as opposed to the book was the revelation of Lyra's parents. In the book, Lyra learns about it under very different circumstances, and much sooner. I think they placed it so in the movie, because it had a bigger impact on Lyra that way, but it didn't seem to matter for the story all that much. The third big change was the order of the last couple of events, and especially leaving out the last big event. Lyra coming across the children and the bears is the opposite in the book. The only reason I can see for the change is that in the movie the party at Mrs Coulter's house is left out. It is there that Lyra learns of Lord Asriel's imprisonment among the bears, and that's why after the children she goes there. While in the movie she knows nothing about that turn of events, so she would have no motivation to head that way, and therefore has to just happen on that storyline while heading to her original goal. The fourth big change is that they left out death, that seems to be an important part of the story. From Lyra exploring the catacombs in the beginning, to the end, death is a part of the story. In the movie, it was taken out. Sure, characters die, but not children. We know from the books that the poor boy Lyra finds dies, and yes, I did shed a tear, but that's not clear in the movie. That particular horror is left out, making the tone milder. In a way, the children who die make what is really happening - without giving too much away -, all the worse. That people would do that without a thought, just to keep children from growing up to thinking freely.The biggest change of all is the milder tone overall that the movie takes. Gone are the references to Christianity. The Magisterium is the big bad, the organisation, while in the book, it was the underlying doctrine, that is the actual problem. I can understand the reason for the change, even though I wasn't pleased by it. The milder tone was also achieved by the ending. Since in the book, Lyra does reach her final end-goal, and in the movie she doesn't. I can especially understand this change, since that still haunts me a bit, and I'm somewhat glad to not have seen it.The best thing about the movie is really Nicole Kidman. She was picked and persuaded by Philip Pullman himself to play Mrs Coulter. Sure, her hair is blonde, but even the author admitted that he should have described his character as a blonde. Nicole Kidman is perfect for the role. Cold, ruthless, even when trying to care. I'm not a big fan of hers, I think in some things she was terrible. However, I will always see Mrs Coulter as she portrayed her.The second books was never made into a movie. It can be the problems with the anti-religious tone, or the fact that a lot of people didn't like it. Truth be told, it did feel rushed. All the events were crammed into these 113 minutes, clearly not enough. However, back in 2007 TV shows still didn't have the budget they do now. 2008 did one good thing. TV became more important, as people cut back on going out. Shows became more popular, and therefore more money is poured into them now. This book would have clearly worked better as a TV show. That is what will hopefully happen, as BBC has promised to develop the trilogy as a TV show. I'm sure the books will the in good hands, as BBC adaptations are very high quality, especially in recent years.Overall, watch this movie. It's pretty good on its own, and if you're unsure about reading the book, it will give you a general idea of it. The CGI is also terrific, and don't forget the real highlight of the movie, Nicole Kidman as Mrs Coulter.",The Golden Compass
202,dumaal,well...,1,30 December 2007,"well, I happened to go to this movie without knowing anything about it. The good thing was the casting, great names, quite good acting, but the story line was disappointing. First of all, it had no end (maybe because there is going to be a second part ...I think it would worth waiting for it before watching this one), ...then the ""dust"" thing... I think a good story must be constructed around things that are present in our cultural background (heroes, fairies, vampires, ghosts,mythological creatures, good vs evil). The dust is something ...unrelated. It's like I would pretend to write the greatest story of our time, about a bottle of milk, a middle aged bird and a broken locker. I already caught you, right?

203,sibelian,Not good enough.,3,10 December 2007,"Meh.On reflection, it's extremely difficult to see how they could have done it. ""Dark Materials"" is one of the most densely written trilogies there is, far more imaginative than the dreary Lord of the Rings, resonant, complex, profound and really pretty dark.This movie had all the problems I expected it to have, overlit, slimy CGI (when are they going to get the idea that shadows can be BLACK? When are they going to get that no matter how much fake computer-dirt they put over their CGI garbage, bizarrely it ALWAYS looks SLIMY? Well, except for the daemons who suffered from a different problem, they were over-humanised. Cats and stoats don't have facial expressions at all, silly film-makers, so they didn't look like animals, so they didn't come across as daemons. They looked, ironically, like dolls), hammy script, bad casting (Daniel Craig... NOOOOOO!!!), poor plotting, predictable design (yet again Myst rears its hideous head...), blech...The whole movie, which, in fairness, would have had to have been another 5 hours long to do justice to the book, was a series of confusing, disjointed expositions followed by flat action sequences. Nowhere did I feel the gears meshing. I didn't care about ANY of them. Well, except Iorek. Good old Ian! Everyone seems to think Dakota Blue was good, I think she could probably have done quite a bit better with a better script.IMAGINE WHAT THIS COULD HAVE BEEN IF DONE BY STUDI GHIBLI?! I have no doubt that this film should have been animated, and I mean properly animated, none of this hideous motion capture garbage. Ugh! But, 3 stars. Why? Lee Scoresby and Hester were perfect. Exactly as I imagined them. 1 star for them.Iorek Byrnison was perfect. 1 star for him.The Bear Fight. The only part of the movie where I felt anything was happening that *mattered*. 1 star.Not impressed. In fairness, really, impossible to adapt to live action, that trilogy.Still... I guess I'll go and see ""The Subtle Knife"" and ""The Amber Spyglass""... although, sitting through the Golden Compass and subsequently realising exactly just how packed with ideas the first book was, I cannot for the life of me see how the hell they are going to film them, as they're even more rich and complex than ""Northern Lights"" (which lights were, irritatingly, completely ignored in the movie. They're central to the book! It's because of them that everyone ends up in the Arctic, the films leaves one very much with the idea that it's all a sort of accident. Messy!) ""Dark Materials"" has MUCH MORE STORY in it than LOTR, even though it's slightly shorter, and has far more alien and fascinating ideas. My BF, who hasn't read the trilogy, could tell straight away that there was a lot more going on in this story than was being shown on screen.I'm getting him the trilogy for Xmas now, so I guess the film's useful for something...",The Golden Compass
204,joshtill-98100,"The Golden Compass points in the right direction, but takes a while to get there",7,4 March 2020,"This movie had come up in my netflix recomendations and I blantly remember hearing about it a decade ago, when it came out in theatres, but I had heard nothing of it, nor anything bad about it. I now understand why. This movie feels like it was translated from a european script, and though it is interesting, it fails to make you care for any of the characters, even with a child in the main point of view. With a starstudded cast, you'd think this movie would do well, but every actor just doesnt mix with one and other and the users cannot comprehend it.The film starts off, explainig that in our dimension, peoples souls live inside of their bodies, but in their world, their souls are placed in a daemon, a animal that never leaves your side. The film then begins with Lyra (Dakota Blue Richards), an 11 year old girl being chased with her friend Roger, by the other kids, led by a boy named Billy Costa. Lyra refuses to follow social norms and insists on being a tomboy, instead of being lady like. Lyra makes a deal with billy, stating that he will bring him a professors robe from the institute she attends if she stops chasing her and Roger. Roger pulls Lyra aside and explains his fear for there is an institution called Gobblers, who have been kidnapping kids and never returing them, but Lyra calms Roger down, stating that if he were ever taken by the gobblers, she would rescue him.That night, Lyra attends a dinner party with her uncle, Lord Azreal (Daniel Craig). Azrael is an explorer, but refuses to take Lyra to the northern parts of europe. Meanwhile, Lyra is introduced to Ms. Coulter (Nicole Kidman), a very wealthy woman who offers to take Lyra up north. Lyra agrees to live with her. Outside of the college, Roger and Billy are kidnapped by gobblers. Lyra waits for Roger and Billy, but they do not show up, and she gets aboard Coulter's jet. Before Lyra leaves, the leader of her college gives her an Alethiometer, a golden compass, and states that it can answer any question. Lyra lives in luxury with Ms. Coulter, until she notices that she is abusing her and not letting her go up north.One night, Lyra sneaks into Ms. Coulters office, which is restricted to Lyra. She finds papers in her desk with Roger and Billy's names and notices at the top right hand corner, the words spell out G. O. B, meaning that Coulter is the leader of the gobblers. Lyra escapes the house and is chased into an alley by gobblers, but is saved by Ma Costa, Billy's mom. In the meantime, Coulter sends tribal soldiers to kidnap Azreal, and sends spy flies to keep watch on Lyra. Lyra notices the flies and diverts one and traps the other in a sealed can. Lyra goes aboard a ship, which is headed to Svalbard, which is where they believe the children are being held hostage.One night, aboard the ship, Lyra attempts to read the compass and does so successfully, realizing that she holds the power to answer any question possible. The next night, she is visited by Serafina Pekkala (Eva Green), a witch who explains that the children are on Bolvangar and are being cut from their daemon, doing a electric surgery called intercision. At the port of svalbard, Lyra befriends a western aeronaut named Mr. Scoresby (Sam Elliot). He tells her that there is a wounded bear who used to be the bear king of svalbard. Lyra asks the compass what happened, and it explains that the king was taken over by a usurper, and stripped of his armour. Lyra finds the armour and gives it back to the bear, who makes a contract with her. That now that he has regained his sanity, he will forever be in debt to Lyra. One night, Lyra follows the compass, which leads her to an abandoned house. Inside she finds Billy Costa, close to death due to hypothermia and without a daemon. Lyra returns Billy to his mom, but is kidnapped by the same warriors who kidnapped Azrael. Scoresby and the bear, Iorek, follow her, only to find them putting her inside the bear kings cavern. Iorek fights the bear and kills it, making him back in his throne as bear king. Lyra and the others continue on their journey without Iorek.Lyra decides to enter Bolvangar alone, and goes by the alias Lizzie Brooks, to ensure she will not be taken by Coulter again. Lyra sees Roger and tells him to ensure the kids get their warm clothes on. Lyra hides isnde an office, where Coulter is meeting with the other gobblers. After coulter leaves, Lyra is found and taken to the intercision room, where she is to be seperated from her daemon. Before the surgery is complete, Coulter notices it is indeed Lyra inside the machine and stops the proceedure. Lyra wakes up inside of Coulters bedroom and questions what gobblers actually do. Coulter explains that their government, the magesterium, wants the next generation of the work force to have their souls inside of them and therefore, cutting their daemons away. She also reveals that she is Lyras mother and that azrael is her father. Coulter asks for the compass, to which Lyra gives her the spy fly, putting coulter into a deep sleep. Lyra pulls the alarm, sets fire to bolvangar, and lets all the kids go free, but soldiers with wolves threaten to attack the children. A massive brawl begins, the children are joined by the witches, Iorek and his bears, as well as Ma Costa and Scoresby. The children win the war and they are all free to return home. Lyra, Roger, Scoresby, Iorek and Serafinah fly to find Lord Azrael, who has been missing in action.The Golden Compass (2007) seems very interesting, but the plot seems to be all over the place. It never seems it wants to go with one story and then it brings in more under-used starpower and it tries to make the users understand how they are connected into the storyline. To be honest, I found Dakota Blue Richards quite dull in her role and I thought the best character in the film was Ms. Coulter, played by Nicole Kidman. I found her very authentic and doing some of the best acting I've seen from her. One thing I have noticed with films in the last decade, is that the film relies of VFX and not story, which is why Golden Compass falls flat.Overall, I'd give The Golden Compass a 6.8/10",The Golden Compass

206,kimdino-1,Something was missed somewhere.,8,18 April 2008,"This film had everything going for it but somehow fell flat. The producers took one the greatest (IMHO) stories, a lot of great acting, award-winning effect and good cinematography. They put all these great ingredients into a pot and, somehow, turned out something none-too-special. I felt that the producers/director have tried to cram it all into too short a time and lost the feel. For this I am inclined to award the result just 6 points.For those who haven't read any of Philip Pullmans 'His Dark Materials' trilogy I cannot begin to tell what was missed. I will say that it is a truly epic tale, full of extremely well developed characters and beautifully told. He, at the same time as telling the story, slips in teaching some very advanced philosophy so well that my 11 year old nephew was able to understand that good and evil are not absolutes but must be judged from a social perspective and gain a (basic) understanding of quantum physics upon reading it. I can see attempts at this in the film but done so hastily that it fails. The vast majority of modern films don't even try to put this, the solid content of a good story, in so I am giving an extra point for the attempt.The great acting deserves another point making 8 in all. That seems about right for what felt like almost a great film. Now, I recommend that reading the books to see what you missed, you won't regret it.

I will also guess that most younger children would probably either enjoy it, find it confusing or maybe even frightening or all 3. I wish I could see it from a child's eye's so I could find out if it was any good...Judging this as an adult who has seen it ""After"" reading the book, I have mixed feelings and some confusion. Some aspects are well done and fit quite well (daemons). The casting is spot on and unfortunately there will not be many accolades for the actors due to most having minimal screen time. Watch out for ""Dakota Blue Richards"" in future releases cause this little gem can steel the show. This movie only follows the book when it fits, otherwise it's a hack job. I can sort of understand why, trying to fit it into a nice children's movie package. But for me, as an adult who has thoroughly enjoyed the book, the movie left me feeling somewhat alienated and most definitely disappointed.Hats off to all the cast as they fit the parts well. I just love ""Ian McKellen"" and he should have won an Oscar for his part in ""LOTR"", but I truly felt that his part in this movie was somewhat...off the mark. Friends that went with me had not read the book and would have liked to have seen something better. It's a ""children's"" film in a ""PG13"" package and it's too bad...I would also like to comment on how it seemed that the film appeared just a tad ""out of focus"" during most of the scenes. It was probably something in the theater I was in, but would be curious to know if others had this experience.",The Golden Compass
208,FlickMan,"Great visuals, but a bit choppy",8,5 December 2007,"I saw The Golden Compass at a preview screening in Tucson, AZ last night. Having not read any of Pullman's books, I had no real expectations one way or the other. Now, after seeing the movie, I'd rate it 7/10 to 8/10  meaning, it's well worth seeing, but has a few flaws.The movie's strongest point is the visuals. The landscapes and machinery are wonderful and convincing -- although the bears do look a bit like the ones in the Coke ads. The acting ranges from adequate to excellent. Sam Elliott shines as Lee Scoresby, but I found Nicole Kidman's performance wooden and unconvincing. Dakota Blue Richards is very good in the lead role of Lyra. The main problem lies with the story. There are so many characters and plot threads that it is easy to become disoriented. Some things are just thrown at you with a brief explanation that barely makes sense. The origins and purpose of the Aliethiometer are given short shrift; it appears to be some kind of Edwardian-era scientific instrument, but in use seems more like crystal ball. As for the movie's alleged ""anti-Christian"" message, I saw little evidence of that. It's pretty much a standard good-versus-evil story, and The Magisterium is not portrayed as a church. It could just as easily be the Illuminati, or even a faceless mega-corporation. As far as it matters, they're just another shadowy group of ""we want to rule the world"" bad guys, although the use of the word ""heresy ""does have religious implications. So, go enjoy it for what it is, and don't worry too much about the details or seek too much in the way of philosophical content.",The Golden Compass
209,happiscotsman,Absolutely Disgusting,4,9 October 2008,"This adaptation was a travesty from about ten minutes in. And considering the talent involved, the shame should burn even further and last longer. Direction is where the train first flies off the tracks here. Did Chris Weitz read the book or the Cliffs Notes? Everything in the story flies forward at warp speed, and since there is much in the story that needs to be dwelt on, trimming details was not the way to go. If you remember, the first Harry Potter movie and The Fellowship of the Ring both clocked in at around three hours, because there was so much to reveal to the audience and no one complained about the length of those movies at the box office. The Armoured Bear fight lasts less than three minutes which doesn't give us enough time to appreciate the importance of what's happening. And I think Ian McKellen was wrong for the voice of Iorek. His voice carries too much majesty to convey the deep wounds of humiliation that Iorek has. I would've used Guy Pearce or Jeremy Irons.Also wrong was taking events that carried a lot of emotional weight, like deaths of certain characters, and sweetening them up to ""spare"" the kids in the audience. Look, it's PG-13, which means the parents have been warned. I saw kids taken to The Dark Knight, and there's no way the Golden Compass could ever approach that kind of shock or horror. I did not like how Nicole Kidman looked as Mrs. Coulter. I think the makeup people could have done a little better than just pretend her face was a plastic mask. Also, there's no back story given on why she's so important to the story. It just occurs and the audience has to play catchup. When ""Dune"" was released in 1984, many thought that it was a good companion piece for those who had read the book, but to the uninitiated, it was a quagmire of confusion. I wouldn't even call this waste of two hours a worthwhile watch for those who have read the book, let alone those who have not.",The Golden Compass
210,schaefer.oliver,is there anything more annoying than a fantasy film starring kids and talking animals?,4,1 February 2009,"Is there anything more annoying than a fantasy film starring kids and talking animals? I don't think so. This movie was pretty lame and I'm surprised that some dumb clerical guys wanted to start a boycott of this movie. Maybe the books were more critical about religion and the church, but nothing of that seems to have find it's way into this movie. First, I hate cute children in leading roles. Second, I hate talking animals in leading roles. Third I hate it when top talent like Kidman and Craig is only there for a few minutes. The screenplay was a mess. Lame, uninteresting, without any suspense and worst, without any sense of wonder regarding the fantasy environment. This movie is the perfect example of too much money going into the visual effects (which were very good) and too less money going into a coherent and plausible screenplay. Even Kidman, Craig and Eva Green leave no lasting impression. The only highlight is a very fine turn by the always reliable Sam Elliott. And the most annoying part is the end. That's it? Talking for the last five minutes about all the things they have to do in the next movie? Are you kidding? This is no total disaster, but if they might move on with a second movie, which is pretty unlikely regarding the box office, don't count on me.",The Golden Compass
211,rcnaylor,Never really grabs you,4,8 December 2007,"Its hard to really like any of the characters except perhaps the spunky minor role of Billy.The heroine is heroic, but not terribly lovable. Annoyingly pretentious and petulant. The kind of child that most in the audience probably thinks needs to learn a good bit more about life than she does to become a better person. The advance of the plot almost seems to by a paint by numbers approach. The best part of the movie is that it is visually stunning.Everything else just doesn't really draw an audience, at least an adult audience, in. You're just sitting there going ""OK, and..."" and then the movie is over with teasers for the next one to come. And, frankly, the character to be saved in the next film has hardly made you care enough about him to invest in a whole plot to save him. You come, you go. You certainly don't want to invest in seeing the pre-designed sequel.",The Golden Compass

And the story is not easy to portray in a film just 113 minutes long. But seeing the film for like the fifth time, now on bluray, I now realize that even though I think that the screenplay was too compressed, the film itself is really, really good. All the right details are there. The costumes are spectacular. The music score is great. The actors are spot on - I love Kidman and Richards especially - but all did a very, very good job. The special effects are truly great, everything from the alethiometer to the daimons and ice bears. Exceptionally well done. So it's really sad to realize that there will be no sequels. Pity that the producers didn't do all three books at once.

The special effects are truly outstanding, the characters have some real depth and are portrayed beautifully. It's a must see family movie. After reading a lot of the press about Phillip Pullman I've now got it on my must read list, even though it's a young adult fiction I'm quite intrigued after reading the themes of religion and god that he explores. I have to agree with the reviewers who are disappointed these didn't get an airing in the movie. How sad is it that our entertainment is blighted like this in name of the American religious masses. The rest of the world is out here and we are quite able to discuss these topics in a rational manner, even with young people. Still, I'm looking forward to the sequels and will definitely catch them at the movies.",The Golden Compass
214,onelegobuilder,Rushed but an entertaining and magical adventure nonetheless,7,8 December 2007,"*SOME SPOILERS AHEAD* ""The golden compass"" was a very engaging novel. And most of what made the story so compelling has successfully transferred on the big screen. Dakota Blue Richards makes a charming young Lyra, as well as the supporting cast behind her such as Nichole Kidman, Daniel Craig, Ian Mckellan, and Sam Elliot. Plus the scenery and special effects are awe-inspiring which make the film more enjoying. Not that it overwhelms the humanity of the film but it does add some texture to the film such. Like when Lyra asks the compass a question and golden dust shows images of people that express the answers. Plus the talking ice bears look life like if not normal sized. At an hour and fifty-three minutes the film is fast paced which can bring good and bad news. The good news is that it doesn't bore the audience with long conversations and it keeps the audience involved if there's a change of setting every minute. Unlike The Da Vinci Code which I had two leave off twice of viewing because it was extremely boring. Plus it doesn't take long for the suspense and battle scenes (Which are very well staged) to come into play. The bad news on the other hand is that some crucial scenes in the book are overlooked or taken out of chronological order. Such as their quest for Bolvangar and Svalbard which have been mixed the other way around, and the secret of Lyra's parents are told by someone else. They don't explain in much detail who the witch's lover is. Of course you see him on screen but he isn't formally introduced for you to understand. Finally the ending is changed by omission which can also have good and bad news of it's own but it flows better for time reasons and because the original ending fell as a cliffhanger. Which I didn't mind in the movie because there were different endings for the books and movies of ""The Lord of the Rings.""To sum it all up: DEFINITELY SEE THIS MOVIE JUST DON'T LET YOUR HIGH EXPECTATIONS GET THE BEST OF YOU.",The Golden Compass

Many of the user comments on here berate the film for the fact that it didn't closely follow the book and ended up cutting out the final section of the book. Given that NewLine had no idea that they would make any further movies, dropping that ending makes perfect sense to have some finality to this movie, versus a cliff hanger. In fact, many of the decisions (how, and more importantly when) Lyra finds out who her parents really are is better handled in the film, versus the book, where the information is told far too early on IMO. However, once decision the filmmakers made (the fight between Iorek and the bear 'king' to regain Iorek's throne) makes no sense where they placed it, since the lop the last section of the book; it made no sense that he won his challenge but the bears did not get called upon to assist with the attack on Bolvanger. The book also, for example, suggested that others could read the compass and that Lyra was not really that special, and that there was more than one compass still floating around. These are choices which may make plenty of sense for those who have read all three books, but people need to remember that these are reviews of MOVIES, not of adaptations.The movie is enjoyable enough on its own merits.

217,french-michaelfrench,"Decent eye-candy, no depth",4,1 January 2008,"I confess I have only dipped into the books; that may mean I like the film for the wrong reasons. It's certainly a children's movie, so I enjoyed the adventures and the cool steam-punk vehicles. Entertaining fantasy. But I feel sure that the books contain themes children should know about but only adults pretend to understand. The film didn't. As I understand it, the books are vigorously in favour of freedom of conscience and the right and duty of human beings to come to a proper moral understanding by themselves. The film is against people who hurt children and steal stuff off drunken bears and, uh, that's it. The thing is, I think there ought to be a depth and grit to the movie which matches a grimy feel of having to navigate with care through a universe in which the moral absolutes are hard to discern. Only a few people really ought to know what is going on; but the film creates immediate monsters and immediate heroes and does it in such obvious terms that there is neither suspense nor mystery. I may be wrong, having missed the book, but shouldn't Lord Asriel be nastier and less reasonable? And shouldn't Mrs Coulter avoid redeeming herself so early in the series? She goes from child catcher (Lollipops! Lollipops! And all free today!)to saint so quick I couldn't blink. Do we think that was written up for the star rather than down for the plot? Hum. A sudden thought occurs. Bridge to Terabithia was a great film dealing with hard issues let down by its publicity. Do you think New Line determined to avoid that criticism by trying to avoid the hard issues entirely? Or will the hard issues come in later in the series, once the hook is in? Well, the one thing that has come out of this is that I shall dive into the book properly and try to find out if I'm right. No movie that makes you want to read the book is a complete failure...",The Golden Compass

The first book revolved around a witty girl's misadventures while conspiracies abound around a mystery known as dust.The girl in the film was not witty. The whole film was not mysterious.This movie failed to convey all the important details from the book while trying to act out the basic appearance of the events that transpired. The result is a rushed story where you can't relate to the characters and a very shallow plot. Characters and plot items are briefly introduced and quickly discarded. It feels like a movie made for children where the only impressive thing is the graphics.Even if it was aimed at children, the ending was a total let down as it ended with a promise of a continuation but failed to give any expectation of what's to come or even any real meaning to the whole journey.If I had not read the books, I would call this movie boring and stupid.

220,maatmouse,A film version of Phillip Pullman's intelligent book,7,31 December 2007,"I came to the Golden Compass having read all of the books and also having read some of the mixed reviews this extraordinary film got. Some reviews stated that the film was a very watered-down version of the book, others stated that Pullman's Dark Materials trilogy attacks the Roman Catholic Church.For the record, I enjoyed the books enormously and found a viewpoint on the Catholic Church, not unlike my own. This film, however, was a different matter. Gone are the explanations about WHY the Magisterium wants to remove free-will from children before they are adult and in its place, is an action movie, more about a young girl who wants to rescue her childhood friend and, in the process, becomes tangled up in a war between the right to exercise free-will and not.The film differs quite a lot from the book but not so much as it becomes unwatchable. The beginning, which explains why this world of Lyra's is so different from our own also gives us a glimpse into the trilogy's second part with ideas of parallel worlds. The part where Lyra hides from her uncle, played quite seriously by Daniel Craig (who really isn't given enough time to develop his character), is very short and concentrates on the main gist of the story about what some view as heresy versus intellect. What is less deeply entered into is the role that Jordan College plays in the book. Other details include Lyra's meeting with Mrs Coulter, played brilliantly and believably by Nicole Kidman and then there is the parts in the story where certain events happen. Lyra's meeting with Ragnar the Bear King is brought forward in the film but is no less enjoyable for it and time constraints make the rescue of the children and the explanations about why the children are being experimented on, much shorter. Lyra's reunion with Lord Asriel is hinted at, which was a disappointment and there is no explanation in the film about why Lyra and her aleithometer is so important to Asriel's work. For that, you need to read the book.Other characters are rendered quite nicely. Eva Green is interesting, well-cast and very pretty as the Witch Queen Serafina Pekkala and Sam Elliott is good fun as the aeronaut Lee Scoresby, although I thought Scoresby was much younger. Dakota as Lyra is brilliant and very much as I imagined, although my feeling might be that she was too old to be believable, but for a first shot at playing Lyra, she is excellent and looks like she'll make the role her own. She had just the right amount of arrogance and innocence to make the role interesting.",The Golden Compass

Is it wrong that I wanted the bear to kill everyone? Is it bad that I wanted the little girl to die after 5 close but no cigar times of getting killed? Well, then I am more wrong then a man in a dress running down Highway 40.Our little epic tale starts as many others, a poor child (this time it is a girl named Lyra,) is running from a group of kids for no clear reason, besides they want her friend. Where she threatens their leader who pulls a bipolar and becomes happy after getting threatened (with a poison robe?! Oh god, not that!) So, Lyra (adequately played by newcomer Dakota Blue Richards) attempts to steal a robe in Jordan College, where she is an orphan living and studying there. Then, she sees a secret meeting (Orphans always get into some huge trouble), where by some weird, weird events, out all these two important men can talk about, they talk about her uncle (god, coincidences are lucky!) So, they poison his drink because he is a free thinker (Oh god, out of all the horrible things, not that!) Well, they make their first no-cigar kill attempt after she pops out of the closet in the nick of time to save her un-surprised uncle Azriel (played by the smart and buff Daniel Craig) from certain doom.

Will Mrs. Coulter get the compass? Will Chris Weitz get lucky and direct a sequel where I have to sit through 100+ minutes to finally get the bear on bear action I was promised?!

224,mollymormonbrat,Pretty eye-candied images and not much else.,4,8 December 2007,"True, it's been a about three or so years since I've read Pullman's ""His Dark Materials"" trilogy, the books upon which this film is based, if you didn't know. But as that time three years ago was my second time going through the trilogy, I still like to think I had a decent memory of them along with a decent opinion. At the risk of offending fans, I always felt Pullman's characters--Lyra, Mrs. Coulter, Will, the whole gang--to be on the weak side of characterization, a few hops from being completely two-dimensional. STILL, I thought the story and theme to be on another plane entirely, certainly enough to make the books as famous as they are and even flesh out an entertaining movie.I promise, I tried my best to like this movie, for the sake of those books. For the sake of Sam Elliot and the goddess Nicole Kidman. Heck, even for that cute little new girl. They all did their best, but frankly this movie was fluff, and it's hard to work with fluff. How could they take such thought- and controversy- provoking books and turn them into fluff? I'm hardly an atheist, but I had appreciated the story's urge for free thought, free will, and a keener look at authority. The smidgen they put in here was all too welcomed, but not enough to give this movie proper heart and soul.What we are left with is a rushed train of lovely cinematography, scenery, and special effects that accompany an equally rushed plot. Yes, there is a lot of story to get into this movie, but making that the priority left me cold toward these characters who were weak in the book and utterly two-dimensional on screen. I felt like I was an infant teenager being instructed in the ways of generic fantasy. Talking bears? Soul-daemons? Other worlds? Texas as a country? Wonderful, fantastic ideas that appeared on the big screen like toys in hurried images.I'm sorry, but while the director was having fun with the camera, the audience was confused by the random jumping from scene to scene, plot to plot.So maybe it was a tragic result of putting a plot-based rather than character-based story in a movie that led to all story and show and no emotional depth. Maybe it was a tragic result of playing it safe by removing all blatant references to religion. Maybe I'm just a whiney book purist.All I know is that the result was flashy, heartless, and boring.",The Golden Compass
225,michaelgs,Rushed ripoff; no payoff,4,9 December 2007,"Perhaps the His Dark Materials trilogy suffers from advanced expectations, but I didn't invent the law of supply and demand. There have been a plethora of fantasies lately and perhaps I can be forgiven for wanting a bit more. Science fiction and comic book fans can feel safe knowing that fantasies haven't yet taken the plunge into deeper themes other than people that wear black and frowns are bad people.Dakota Blue Richards stars as a beautiful girl raised by a group of scholars (including her uncle, played by Daniel Craig) who are fiercely protective of her at first, yet seem impotent when an icy Mrs. Coulter comes to take her away. The reason given is not the least bit believable or original. Anyway, Lyra soon escapes the White Witch, and meets up with just about every creature imaginable. All of which want to help her of course, because they can recognize her on sight as the one person who will save them all from eternal darkness. Plus, she's more resourceful than Batman's utility belt.I don't fault the performances, although Kidman doesn't belong in this film. There are, quite frankly, too many characters in this film. That is true with all fantasies, but most fantasies know how to put their supporting cast away for the final scene instead of bringing them all out for a showdown that might be considered overdoing it. The bad guys are not nearly numerous or perilous enough to make you think them any true threat to our heroine. A good director and screenwriter knows how to condense source material. The people in this movie don't.The bottom line: this is a trailer for the franchise, and one that is too rushed to make you care about any of the people involved. There is an accusation that this movie is anti-church. If that's the case it fails in it's premise; a more even-handed approach might have actually been more devastating. The movie says in one scene that it's about free will. If that is so, than Lyra certainly has to learn there's more to free will than reading and taking orders from an all-knowing metal Macgruffin.",The Golden Compass

Nicole Kidman played herself, soulless, witchlike, creepily beautiful.

229,zydonk,Running on empty.,6,7 January 2020,"Came to The Golden Compass after ten minutes of the BBC/HBO His Dark Materials series. Read a lot of background as well. But haven't read the trilogy.As it is, The Golden Compass is quite an entertaining film, full of character and incident, yet empty, ultimately a lot of fuss about nothing. Restoring the author's ideology would add nothing meaningful to the film. This ideology is obviously a transposition of 17th century Puritan paranoia, as indicated by the title of the trilogy. Ironies abound in this ideology: Oxford is a bastion of free thought here, in 17th century England is was a royalist bastion, supporting in effect royal absolutism and implicitly Roman hegemony. It's atheism can tolerate souls capable of receiving a kind of grace, a psychism projected rather accurately as the demons that accompany humans.Compared with the TV series, The Golden Compass handles the demon aspect very well indeed, in fact constituting one of the satisfying aspects of the film. The dialogue, also, is far superior. The BBC tends to dramatise as much as possible - presumably because viewers watch with remote in hand - so that dialogues tend to a local dramatic closure, which has the effect of breaking the narrative flow. Characterisation is richer and more satisfying. Perhaps cinema permits a larger range of expression, but again the BBC tends to seek to limit its audience responses, perhaps reflecting a domestic environment where anxieties and a counterbalance of vague hope predominate.Whatever ultimately determined the final version of The Golden Compass, it is surprising that the Roman church took it so seriously. This suggests that the church authorities involved are as vacuous theologically as Pullman is secularly. That the trilogy is treated as serious literature indicates a more pervasive vacuity in contemporary western culture. I've deducted points above to reflect this emptiness.",The Golden Compass

The film seems to rush through the story, not flow with the story. The end comes to soon, and yet no conclusions are drawn so that a sequel will obviously follow.

232,blw37,Tries too hard to be Lord of the Rings,5,16 January 2010,"The Golden Compass seems to be a missed opportunity of a movie. The film company were obviously hoping to start a new fantasy franchise like LoTR and Harry Potter without showing any real understanding of how they worked. While the acting quality was almost uniformly high (unlike Harry Potter) the story telling was disjointed and uninvolving and the script almost painfully bad in places. It appears that the makers looked at the spectacular special effects of LoTR, in particular, and forgot that what made that series work was not the visuals (although they were necessary to tell the story) but the characters and story, which everything else was intended to serve. Here the story is made to serve the effects rather than the other way around.The striving to be LoTR is particularly noticeable in the casting of Ian McKellan and Christopher Lee. However the movie did not do either actor any favours, with Lee having only one line and McKellan delivering lines that looked like a parody of his role as Gandalf. When the bear played by McKellan yells to the heroine to run on from a thin crumbling bridge that he cannot cross, my whole family burst into laughter - which did not seem to be the effect striven for.The CGI was mostly of a high quality, but was uneven in places, with McKellan's character again being poorly served, moving from realistic to cartoonish and back again several times.I am sure that the series by Philip Pullman could have made a good series of movies, but this was not the script or director to launch one.",The Golden Compass
233,datdudesketch,"I don't get it, please explain it to me!",3,27 January 2008,"I haven't read the book, I don't know anything of the film other than it was ridiculously boring and very poorly put together. The storytelling is so misplaced or scattered that it was hard to understand exactly what was going on. Yet there in lies another problem. When the characters attempted to clue me in through dialog, it sounded like they were reading an instruction manual out loud. The young star of this film was so robotic that she could easily snatch the ""worst performance"" title from ""Attack of the clones"" star Hayden Christensen. If not for the beauty of Nicole Kidman, I would've never got past the first 30 minutes. And note that I said her 'beauty' not her talent, which is a huge disappointment. Next thing to bother me was the whole dust thing. Dust? Dust?!! All the amazing things in this universe and their making a fuss over dust?! I feel dumber for having watched this film. The only reason I even gave it 3 stars is for the demon animals which were the most interesting part of the film. The animation didn't blend with the reality as smoothly as I had hoped, but they did intrigue me.",The Golden Compass
234,john-quel,"A Noble Effort, an almost triumph -- May the Box Office Reward It",9,7 December 2007,"I went into this film fearing the worst. I had become concerned over the past months as it became increasingly clear that the film was at great risk of losing direction, the vision if you will, that had drawn readers to the books series in the first place. That it was doomed. I feared this strange kind of anti-Narnia, was likely being so diluted that BO disaster was certain. That may still be the case if the bulk of early reviews are to be believed (but see Ebert's all-out glowing review.) Admittedly, the movie probably works better if you have read the first book (I had), but those readers are precisely the people who would likely complain the most. I worried and yet . . .Despite its breathtaking pace, both in terms of action and concept introduction -- we all agree this is not your typical fantasy -- the Golden Compass worked for me. I thought the people involved had done the best they could in making this movie tell the story, making the best possible film despite the conflict and panic that must have gone into it. The sincerity shows. The cast is superb, the action sequences, the effects, the sheer look of the film, are triumphs. I stayed through all the credits, which seemed to last for almost as long as the movie, and good gracious, what a lot of people worked on this! It's expensive all right, but the money is all on the screen. These people should be saluted.Dakota Blue Richards (it appears if you want your daughter to have a movie career these days, you had best name her Dakota) in a great year for the debut of young actresses, stands out as the best of them. She has poise, indomitable courage, fierce determination and it just keeps coming. The whole movie depends on her and if she had faltered, they truly would have had a disaster on their hands, a ""calender"" movie with no where to go and nothing to do. Whatever the ultimate financial fate of the film, I think young Miss Richards has a great future ahead of her.So I am recommending the film highly, though I respect the objections that have been made against it. I think if people just relax and go with it they will find themselves enjoying it immensely. However, if you grit your teeth and go into critic mode, yep, you guess it, you won't enjoy it at all.As for myself, I would have liked the producers to have gone with the original extended version - everyone knows the last few minutes were cut. Moreover, with a full three hour version just like ""Lord of the Rings,"" I think all the objections would have been met. A director's cut will likely appear some day and I think at that point people will realize how great this movie truly is. Such an enhanced cut would fill in a lot of the details of this world, more fully develop the scenes and characters, and truly give a feeling of being part of the adventure, instead of just watching it. Of course, for the Golden Compass series, by then it may well be too late.Here's hoping it's not (I dare not say praying). Here's hoping that audiences will respond so this noble beginning of a great philosophical adventure and permit it to continue.It's all bottom line at this point, folks.",The Golden Compass
235,AdderCowley,Not one for the fans,5,21 January 2008,"Having finally been able to see ""The Golden Compass"" after the years of speculation I have to say I'm disappointed. When watching a book to film translation you obviously have to change things, switch events round, change the appearance of characters but I personally found the changes ineffective and unwarranted.For starters...The Golden COMPASS? What annoys me about this is that it is obviously cooperate driven: oh...people might be put off if it was called Northern Lights...maybe not enough of our potential demographic haven't read the book etc It felt contrived and uncomfortable. And the problem is that they always rammed it down your throat, calling it the oleyphemometer and then saying as if a sidenote also known as the golden compass. Why not just call it by its proper name and be done with it...Also the casting I felt was strange. Although an vast star-studded cast there are few decent performances. Daniel Craig is even more pouty and obnoxiously arrogant than before and does not have a huge presence in the film. Furthermore Ian Mckellen voice acting, while good, just didn't feel right in a huge, hulking bear. The child acting was also annoying as the girl who played Lyra would speak in a middle-class British accent and then either say ""ain't"" or some other slang and spit...Christopher Lee, one of the great villain actors being used for 3 minutes? what a waste...That is not to say that all the actors were below par, I felt Nicole Kidman played Mrs. Coulter rather well and was seductive and evil as Mrs.Coulter should be and the golden monkey was genuinely scary. It seems as though they expended all their energy in creating Mrs.Coulter for Nicole Kidman and then not bothering with the rest. Also Sam Elliot (as Mr.Scoresby) had his moments.Now with my main quarrel, something which pretty much everyone who has read the book will have been reciting 100 times, the ending...What an anti-climax, the fight scene outside Bolvangar was a pretty mediocre ending for a film which lasted past the 2 hour mark...and also the fight between Iorek and Ragnar as though it was an afterthought to be included. Maybe that should have been the end scene?...Again it was a late decision to remove the Northern Lights scene thus they had to find another way to end the movie...another cooperate influence? All in all this popular fantasy novel has been sloppily transferred to cinema using a huge wealth of acting talent, money and writing material to create a pretty low-average blockbuster...its a shame because I did enjoy the books and was expecting something better than this...",The Golden Compass
236,stephengibbons-2,Lacks Heart,3,2 December 2007,"If I never read the book, I suppose I'd grade it a point higher. But I was, for the most part disappointed. The entire mystique of the text is the relationship of Humans with their Daemons. The reason millions continued reading the next 2 books in the series was the human/daemon devotion to one another. It's the heart and soul of the entire trilogy, and it's NOT the central focal point in the movie. It's barely mentioned. The chronology is inexplicably altered in the film as well. Why can't Hollywood co-opt novels in an intelligent way? Did they learn nothing from ""Lord Of The Rings""? Any fan of those books will tell you that Peter Jackson's adaptation was so utterly clever in it's adherence to the 'IT' factor of the text. Hollywood truly believes the masses are fools, mouth breathing, move-their- lips- while-they're-reading fools. They must, otherwise 'Compass' might have retained more than a fifth of the novels luster. If you haven't read the book, then my review is lost on you, and all I can suggest to you is to read it, or buy the audiobook on iTunes(my new favorite medium for fantasy novels such as this and the Potter books) Those who HAVE read it I'm sure will agree with me once they've seen the film. Bear fight rocked, but it was too short. Overall, it's just another NICE movie about a little kid with a grand destiny. AND without spoiling anything, The film ended about 30 pages shy of the books ending. Those not in the know have no clue what they are really missing.",The Golden Compass
237,UnlovedSeason,Very disappointing,4,9 January 2008,"The Golden Compass (bad title!) is visually captivating, surprisingly well cast and undeniably entertaining on a basic level, but it could and should have been SO much better.The curse of modern film editing strikes again as, clearly, masses more material was shot only to be stripped down to achieve a specified (surprisingly short) running time. Consequently, the plot seems very rushed  irritatingly so  for the first half, before settling down later to a better storytelling pace. Characters disappear from a location without explanation, or else ignore things that would surely be commented upon, presumably because these scenes have been pruned and cut together so ruthlessly. And some early scenes end so abruptly it's obvious that someone was desperate to keep them in, but felt they couldn't have them at full length. They'd have been better excised altogether and the time used elsewhere, or else the film simply allowed to be longer.The total bloodlessness throughout is frankly offensive  to the intelligence and to modern sensibilities. I have a problem with violence being included but portrayed so unrealistically. No-one expected (or wanted) to see the extreme goriness of the novel in a movie that very young children would see, but it is surely more damaging to include these fights to the death and all-out warfare without giving across some idea of consequences and the realities of life and death. (Compare this with the BBC's brilliant modern, yet whole-family appealing Doctor Who.) The all-smiles WE WON! moment amid a corpse-strewn yet ridiculously unmessy battlefield I found disturbing. What a far cry from the novel, Northern Lights. Philip Pullman may be accused of many things, but his fantasy is concerned with matters of the human condition where this film consistently shies away.Lack of consequences and maturity, motivation and character is the main problem with this movie, I think. The screenplay seems to have been recollected by someone who read the book as a kid but missed much of the point and has forgotten all the subtlety  while remembering that there were talking animals and flying machines. Nicole Kidman (and Derek Jacobi, too) does well to convey the important central message that nothing is more frightening than a person who absolutely believes they are right, but that's all you get of Pullman's provocative vision.The fact that the film ends on such an unexpected damp squib is the final straw and really astounded me, it actually left everyone in the cinema notably deflated. I'd be interested to know if non-book-readers found it odd, or whether it worked provided you weren't still hoping Compass would redeem itself as an adaptation of Lights. As it is, the story is short of all the vital final scenes where we get an explanation for the Magisterium's attitude towards Dust (the book, if you don't know, is set in an alternative history where the terrible Inquisition of the C.15th-17th has never ended), Lord Asriel's darker nature is made clear and there's that wonderfully exciting cliffhanger. Removing ALL the theology is one (bad) thing; emasculating the actual story is quite another.Oh, and lastly, the constant zooming into the alethiometer for some Dust-sprinkly SFXs was, for me, the precise WRONG way to convey its work and interpretation. I found this directorial choice clumsy, and was desperate to actually see the thing itself (an impressive prop, but tantalisingly glimpsed), and it and the truth-reader's thought process working illustrated for me in a more imaginative way.A sequel looks fairly unlikely. Certainly, I feel, it would not work as an adaptation of the far more complex and thought-provoking novel, The Subtle Knife, if similarly treated.",The Golden Compass
238,shanebeacham,"Visually Great, But The Story Wasn't Told Right",5,18 February 2010,"I've read the book by Phillip Pullman, and while I'm not a fan of the series, I thought it was an alright book. Still, the movie looked impressive and that's why I read the book in the first place.After Lord of the Rings came out, everyone has been wanting to make the next big fantasy film. Some have actually succeeded, like Pan's Labyrinth and The Chronicles of Narnia. Others have failed miserably, like Eragon. So is this the next fantasy film or is it another failure disappointment? Everything from the design, clothing, the visual effects, everything visually was great. They made the world come to life. The actors are actually great. Daniel Craig in the small bit of the film that he's in. Sam Elliot is amazing and makes the film better whenever he's on screen. Ian McKellen, Ian McShane, Nicole Kidman, they were all great.And the polar bears were amazing. I hope they make like some sort of spin-off of the film where we go into the mythology of these polar bears because they were easily the best done.But the problem is Chris Weitz has no idea how to treat this material and how to get this on screen. And you can just tell they wanted to make another Lord of the Rings so they even have Christopher Lee show up for less than a minute and have him never show up ever again.The film has no soul. You never get to know these characters, they're motives, what's the point of this scene or this scene, what's the point of this whole film. And the reason is they are always going from one place to another and not having anytime to get used to that place. Like one critic said, it felt like watching a cliff notes version of the film and it was still a two hour film.You're waiting for this incredible climactic scene at the end of the film. Instead all you get is a battle of no real significance to the story and they just left it hanging for the next film, which will probably not happen now. And many people who loved the book will hate the ending because they cut it out. There was no ending at all.Overall, this is not a bad movie, but it isn't a great one either. I think if Weitz had taken the time to explore this material and get it right on screen, we would have ended up with a great fantasy piece. Unfortunately we didn't get that. I was gonna give this a five but Sam Elliot lit up the screen so I'm gonna give this a six. Again, not a bad film, but I'll probably forget about it in a week.",The Golden Compass

242,DizzyDitz,"Enjoyable, but falling short of expectations",6,6 December 2007,"For all of you who are fans of the book, I'll go there. I am also a fan, but I tracked the production of this movie obsessively for years, so I knew what changes to the story were coming. I do not think that by themselves they amount to cutting the soul of the story out. It is my opinion that in order to do a wonderful job capturing the story you would have needed a lot more time in this movie, something like Lord-of-the-Rings-esquire three hours, and no kid is going to sit through that happily. Many of the almost-major characters (Lee Scoresby, Serafina Pekkala, Iorek Byrnison) follow our protagonist for unclear reasons. Iorek is a disappointment, and Ian McKellen was a terrible choice for his voice (and normally I love Ian McKellen, but he is no bear!) The daemons are AMAZING.But most important thing to be aware of is how this stands as a movie in itself, and I am sad to say that it does not. True, it does not make many of the mistakes that films aimed at children make. There is no moral that they beat you over the head with throughout the film. The acting is superb - Nicole Kidman and Dakota Blue Richards were spot-on choices for their roles and they do an incredible job. The special effects are well done. The biggest problem is the script. It shows that Chris Weitz's ego got in the way of his better senses when he decided to write the screenplay. Many of the events are disjointed and feel like they were thrown in there for the benefit of following the book but NOT for the benefit of crafting a good movie story. I went to the cinema with friends who had not read the books and they did not particularly care for the movie. There is no doubt that it shows many of the elements that made the book incredible. But what it lacks is the wry humor and master storytelling that made these books more than just your ordinary fantasy series. There are many mediocre fantasy books and movies that feature incredible creatures - witches, multiple worlds, aliens, talking animals etc - but Pullman's tale was one of growing up, told with wisdom. It has disappeared, you might say that it has undergone intercision.",The Golden Compass

Sheb Wooley made the original Wilhelm scream in 1951. It was first heard in the Gary Cooper movie Distant Drums. The best part of the Golden Compass is all the demons and the idea that dust filters between this world and other worlds. I hope that there will be several sequels in the future. The relationships between Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig) and Mrs. Coulter (Nicole Kidman) are not really developed well in this movie and it leaves you wondering if Lyra is their daughter or not. The Polar Bears, Sam Elliot, Ian Mc Shane, Ian McKellan, are all great characters in this movie too",The Golden Compass
244,Mattissimplythebest,"Golden Effects, but story not up to scratch",6,12 February 2008,"I love the idea of having a particular animal that follows you around and is connected to your personality - it provides a lovely insight into the characters' mind that otherwise needs to be expressed solely by the actor/actress. I also thought it was an extremely well conceived fantasy environment from scene to scene, and the work that has gone into the graphical representation is quite mind boggling. However, having only seen the movie and not read the books I thought the story was a little weak in places, and that the world of the story isn't as clear perhaps as it could be. Perhaps I am used to being pampered with fantasy adventures, especially with the Lord of The Rings Trilogy - but still I felt that at 113 min a number of threads were cut a little short and were less developed.I really enjoyed it as a bit of an action adventure, but ultimately I found large portions very forgettable; my main criticism here would centre on the Marketing of the film which seems to have been aimed so much at younger children that it forgot that there is still a film to be made. Quality here has been sacrificed in favour of making as much money as possible - and it is unfortunately a familiar story. Fans of the books will also be disappointed that this version of Pullman's first book does not share the authors' ending.The trilogy will undoubtedly be made, but it staggers me that the strength of creating the next two rested quite so heavily on the success of this film.

If you did not read the book but have little imagination or are an idiot you will probably rate this film badly. If you don't like kids fantasy you will rate this badly and probably should not have watched it anyway. If you are none of these and have a good imagination and like your 'childrens' fantasy stuff a little more testing than the usual Disney type rubbish then this is for you.Before I went to see the film I had no idea what it was about, who was in it or what kind of reviews it had received.

Great animation of polar bear, but copper armor seems a bit odd, style vise and compositing vise. I curios, why is there is so many polar bear characters everywhere, and they always look exactly the same, in my opinion it could look better and more unique if there were some dirt added, not just plain white (like in King Kong fur looks absolutely spectacular).

And while there are a lot of very strong reviews for this film there were one or two which really slated it, so I expected an average forgettable film which might at least entertain me. And I do like fantasy stories.So I was mighty disappointed with the incredibly dull tripe I saw tonight. I can't believe how anybody can give this a decent review, the effects were average, the script was appalling, the story far too contrived, the acting irrelevant as half the actors get very little screen time. And the story isn't confusing, although there are obviously lots of things from the books left out, it's just too rammed full of different things to keep you interested.The pace of the film is one of the worst I have ever experienced. Too rushed and not enough good action to keep you thrilled, all by the numbers sequences.And what is it with Eva Mendes, she sounds weird in every film she's in, I think she is actually English, but she sounds like a foreigner attempting an English accent; very bizarre and almost ruins every film she's in.",The Golden Compass
251,sammyocarr,I liked it but it was let down by the acting!,5,17 December 2008,"I feel that watching the film left me empty. It's all well done however there's no real 'wow' to the film. Excellent CGI, beautiful effects and colours however the acting was dire. The best actor in it, Daniel Craig, was hardly featured and Nicole Kidman didn't have to try to play a boring cold bitch. Northen Lights by Phillip Pullman is certainly an enjoyable read, soul-daemons, dust worlds and truth compasses are brilliant idea's. So naturally the film was destined to have a good narrative if the book was followed.What impressed me about this film was its realistic computer effects. The animation of the daemons and especially the bear were outstanding, simple animation such as the landscapes, the weather and buildings are all of great quality and help to enhance the films magical feel.If the film had a highlight it had to be the CGI fight sequence between the bears, that was awesome, the removal of the kings jaw was brilliant. Yet the rest of the film was pretty mundane, it was all very obvious where the story was heading (obviously if you read the books you already knew of the ending.) But those that hadn't could of easily guessed all the 'twists' and 'turns' of the story, as they were painfully obvious. Where the film failed to impress me was in the quality of acting. The actress Dakota Blue Richards, is anything but. I felt as if i was watching a primary schools nativity scene. Her lack of emotion, over emphasis on every word, mellow-dramatic expression and mechanical movement all have a negative impact on the film. The vital role was filled with a low rate actress and therefore the film suffered. The voice of Ian McKellen, as amazing and rich as it is, felt out of place on the Giant Bear. When the bear first spoke I was wishing for a voice such as Sean Connery's or maybe even Alan Rickman's. However the voice of McKellen seemed just unfitting for the bears appearance.Nicole Kidman, (used heavily to promote the film along side Daniel Craig) was pretty boring. It can't of been difficult to act like a heartless Ice woman, no offence to Kidman but its not difficult. Daniel Craig's character was barely even in the film which was disappointing.In all, the film's promise and quality is mainly down to the quality writing of the book. Excellent concepts, character and narrative were wounded by the average acting. This is made up for by the films excellent animation, cinematography and directing. Its worth watching, whether you've read the book or not. Not one for a DVD collection however.",The Golden Compass

The visual effects are beautifully executed, and the way the characters interact with the CGI is perfect.However, beyond the enjoyment of the movie I have to say, the one thing that stood out was Dakota Blue Richards: a young actress with such screen presence and believability in her portrayal of Lyra that I hope she will be picked up and engaged by many studios. A lot of acting comes through the eyes, and in this young actress' eyes was a world of wonder and vision.I look forward to the next instalment. Unlike Adam1494, I have never read the books, so I had no preconceptions. I do know that most every film you see based on a book you have read is a disappointment (from Starship troopers through to Harry potter); but sometimes you have to realise the limitations of celluloid (or disc, whatever) and accept the attempts of a producer to bring a massive volume to a few minutes of imagery.I would recommend this film to anyone - young or old - and happily watch it again.

253,randomorwhat,Nothing close to expectation...,2,6 December 2007,"Disappointment abound. They've managed to take the first installment of one of the finest triolgies written and turn it into an hour and a half family fantasy, with little hint of storyline, underlying message or relevant dialogue. Casting? Very nicely done. Acting? Mediocre; nice to see some pretty decent performances from younger actors and actresses, very well played role by Kidman and Craig (managing with a Godawful script) CGI? Very reminiscent of any fantasy-based epic over the last five years. Hoardes of people screaming at one another? It's been done; time and time again. How about a moment or two to focus on the character's development, also to write a linear plot faithful to the literature work it was bastardised from? For children, this will be a pleasant yarn - something perhaps straight to DVD worthy. For adults, this is mediocrity and Hollywood at it's finest and most stagnant. For followers of the books, it is nothing short of appalling.A superb cast let down by a woefully inadequate scriptwriter and director.",The Golden Compass

Golden Compass passes that test with flying colors. Congratulations to Philip Pullman and Chris Weitz.Then I would cast good actors. Beautiful, sweet Nicole Kidman as a villain! It works and she is great it the part. The star is Richards, she is Lyra.Sorry if I don't get all the terms right when I talk about animation. I have seen my share of animation, none of them have been quiet right, Beowulf is a good example. I woke up this morning and just had to write this review because I realized there was just a lot of animation in this movie and I didn't realize it until this morning. That is good animation.I am looking forward to director Chris Weitz's next episode.",The Golden Compass
255,kuchynata,Not for children,2,7 December 2007,"First and foremost I must say this is not for children, it's waaaaay too violent.Now, onto the reason for the plethora of no-consequence (no blood, ever) extreme violence - the story is severely lacking and the structure is non-existent. The filmmakers had to put too long of scenes of violence in order to ""keep"" the audience's attention and give them a sense of a rush of adrenaline. Otherwise, without all the violence the theater would have been full of zzzzz's.The first twenty minutes are a bunch of talking heads, all exposition, no plot. The rest of the movie continues that way, jumping from talking heads to violence and back again. I leaned over to my friend after about 45 minutes and asked, ""What's Lyra's goal? Why are we following her on this journey?"" Any good script will tell you in the first 10 minutes, usually in the first five. Any good script will have good dialogue, too. Not the monotonous and predictable lines we were fed in this film.Not having read the books, I thought I'd be in a good position to avoid noticing in the film what all the pre-release blather was about with respect to Pullman's atheistic bent in the books and now the film. I was right and wrong. The film was anti-organized religion (mostly the Roman Catholic church), not anti-God; at least that's what I could tell when I was willing to pay attention (like when Daniel Craig was on screen). I shouldn't have to read the book to understand what's going on in a film adapted from a book. Utterly ridiculous. I now have no interest whatsoever in reading the books. A shame, since I had such high hopes for this story, even after reading many, many, many blogs about why I shouldn't see the movie or read Pullman's books. A real shame since I love a good story and this had all the markings. But, I'm glad to know I can't be lead around by the nose by the Christian right or a person like Pullman, whatever he professes himself to be.",The Golden Compass

The general public's rating might not be so high but if you have the option, this is a good movie to watch. This film was supposed to be the next Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings(However I enjoyed this one movie more than the 5 Potter movies I've seen and leagues more than Lord of the Rings).I'm holding out that they may resurrect this film for a franchise.

Daniel Craig was really appalling.Nicole Kidman was good, but should stay away from films like this. Hopefully sequels are not on the way.I sat through this film, and I still ponder how I managed to stay awake.It could have been spectacular.Thestory was good, but the film was but together poorly.

258,Black-Jack-Shellac,Why is everyone so bloody negative about this adaptation,9,1 June 2008,"I am astounded by the negative reaction to this film adaptation of the first book in Pullman's excellent trilogy. I avoided the film in the theatre because of the negative comments by fans of the books and had assumed that they must have really screwed up the story. I was happily proved wrong when I rented this this past weekend. The story has changed somewhat, but not detrimentally, in my opinion. The special effects are very very good, I really liked how they showed Lyra's use of the Alethiometre, and Iorec (Yorrick, of course, that drove me nuts while reading the books almost as much as Hermione drove me nuts while reading Harry Potter) seemed remarkably realistic. The acting was a little over the top in places, perhaps, but other than that I thought it ranked up there with the LoTR as adaptations go, especially ones with such rapid fan bases. If you've ever seen the atrocity that is Ralph Bakshi's adaptation of LoTR, you'll know what a truly bad adaptation is like.I for one would really like to see the results of books one and two brought to screen. You fans of the books who are dissing the film are doing so to spite yourself. Get a grip.",The Golden Compass

Oh - and one father - should mention that, right?).I love the books. Part of the reason I love them is that they aim for the people who don't want easy, who don't want pat, who would quite like to sit chewing a thumbnail for a little while, thinking, 'I'm not sure about this...'.Think 'Battle Royale'. Think 'Serenity'.So, as I handed over my ticket, and the chap said 'enjoy the film', I said 'I hope so...'.And he said, all quiet-like: 'best film we've ever shown here.' People - take a moment to think back through every cinema-going experience you've had. Ever had a member of staff climb out on a limb like that? Nope? It was a first for me, too...And that's the cinema I first saw Bambi at - making the point that I think he wasn't saying: 'comparing this only with films such as 'Dumberer & Dumberest', it is my considered opinion that...' I shared the auditorium with one member of staff, one courting couple, three families, three grown-ups who arrived in a group, and about seven other people who arrived alone and without popcorn, picked a seat with a good view, and concentrated avidly on the film for the duration.I'm sure we all had different opinions - but the two kids who moved from behind me to right down the front - they seemed pretty keen. The lad who kicked the seat seven across from me throughout the trailers - he stopped when the film started, and then used it only as punctuation for battle scenes, for which I'm enormously grateful.Headcount when the film ended was the same as headcount when film started, and I didn't notice one person go for a toilet break. And, trust me, I have the ears of a bat, and a parent's peripheral vision...This was always going to be a hard one to screen without being blamed for a few firebombings, but darn if they didn't walk that line.And I did seriously consider chatting up two of the guys who arrived alone to see the film because a) they were startlingly good-looking, and b) when you glance at someone's face during a film, and they're reacting very subtly, but reacting nonetheless, and too drawn into the film to even notice you staring... well.But instead, I sprinted home, still married.Helen",The Golden Compass
261,dekkar5,Dreadful and Disappointingly boring.,1,9 December 2007,"The Golden Compass spends far too much time explaining the boring and generic mythology behind the dull and uninteresting world it takes place in; far too much time setting up the silly and poorly crafted antagonist's motivations, and almost no time actually entertaining the audience.Almost all of the actors' performances in this film come off as extremely pretentious and forced, especially Nicole Kidman who's career has been rocketing through bad movie after bad movie since the late 90's.The only real actor in this disaster is Mr. Daniel Craig, who, bless his heart, is given barely any screen time to speak of.Without giving anything away, the heart of The Golden Compass' problems is that its story is ridiculous, silly, stale, and spiritless.If you can manage to get past the incredibly dull first hour and half of the flick, you are eventually treated to 2 giant polar bears fighting, and an giant ending battle, where the lighting is so dark and poorly executed that it might as well have never happened.

The only reason I'm giving this a two is because I liked one of the fight scenes that was towards the last half hour of the film. Very disappointing. It was a fairly good cast, too.

263,et-89,Badly abbreviated,5,18 December 2007,"I haven't read the books before seeing this movie, and yet it was obvious to me that the book had been cut. This had been done amateurishly. The movie felt disjoint, with some parts making little sense (like why Lyra would sit alone in a market holding the compass after sailing with the Gyptians), and most parts feeling like they were rushing things.I ended up not getting attached to any of the characters. The only one I felt I cared somewhat about was Lord Asriel, but he had a very small part. Some parts, like the witch visiting Lyra on the boat, felt like a character dropping in for plot's sake, then dropping out. In fact, it was more or less so with most of the characters.The movie did make me want to read the books, if only to see what's been cut. Having started reading the book (and I'm just a few chapters in), I see that the movie has not only cut but also altered the book quite a bit. I also see that it has failed to give any idea of what the world is like. The Magisterium turned into some generic threat I didn't really understand (though that may partly be because I'm not Christian), and the world felt far from ours, kind of a generic fantasy world, while in the book it feels like an alternate universe close to ours.The movie wasn't really bad, as it did provide a plot and decent visuals, but it was largely disappointing, compared to some other fantasy movies.",The Golden Compass
264,beckwith10,A Movie that Feels Stripped of its Daemon,6,7 December 2007,"Oh, fer crying out loud! Golden Compass seems to have the look, the cast and the special effects down pat, but otherwise feels like a shallow simulation of the book. Weitz connects the plot dots (doing end runs around a few), then plows through in high gear. This is a movie, not a jaunt in a sports car! There's no emotionally-involved story telling here, and the audience feels no investment. A big, epic fantasy should have the roominess and luxury of a big, inviting easy chair - sit back, relax, and take it all in. But Weitz never stops to relax, nor seems to understand how to moderate the narrative pacing, nor find nuance or poetic subtlety in moments that allows the audience to reflect and connect - a dimension that is essential to the Pullman books. Jackson understood this all too well with respect to LOTR and achieved symphonic grandeur. But Weitz operates like a mere technician on auto pilot. He wasn't ready to take this sort of project on yet because he hasn't achieved the necessary artistry. Did no one at New Line understand what sort of property they were dealing with? And by the way, who was the fool that told Weitz he had to cram the picture into a two hour package?",The Golden Compass
265,Tararaboomdia0101,Excellent... until the ending,7,8 December 2007,"I went to see this movie today expecting to absolutely hate it, and was pleasantly surprised. The trailer was, in my opinion, pretty appalling, but this was far from the case with the movie. There are some extremely good turns by the cast: Dakota Blue Richards has Lyra down pat, her performance was flawless in my opinion, a far cry from the cringeworthy acting from the young cast in the early Harry Potter films. Nicole Kidman is suitably steely as the venomous Mrs Coulter, able to be both captivating and terrifying by turns (although whenever Eva Green was on the screen, I couldn't help feeling she would have done an equally good job). Daniel Craig wasn't quite as ruthless as I'd expected, this is evident when he is denied the ending that reveals the brutal nature of his character (and I have more to say on that point later).A lot was kept in from from the books, even though the order was changed around (this does actually make more sense, storytelling-wise as the large-scale battle at Bolvanger was a more climactic fight.)The only slight continuity problem with this was, as Svalbard took place first, why didn't Iorek bring the bears to Lyra's aid at Bolvanger, seeing as he's supposed to be their king? I wasn't bothered by the pacing of the movie as it kept in all the essential elements, even if the whole Magisterium is somewhat dumbed down. But the moment I saw Derek Jacobi on the screen, I was perfectly happy to forgive this slight deviation. I would have been happy for the running time to have been longer if it meant including The Cocktail Party, in which Lyra meets Lord Boreal (is an extended edition going to be available?) but Lyra's escape from Mrs Coulter was done in a perfectly convincing manner.There were only three things that really bothered me, and two are minor. The overly explanatory opening seemed somewhat forced; it's probably the first time I've seen SparkNotes incorporated into a movie. Having the subtle atmosphere of mystery and sombre opening from the book would, in my opinion, have been a much more engaging beginning. Also, the moment where Lyra discovers what intercision entails rather lacked the impact it had in the book, especially as we never discover what happened to Billy afterwards.However, this film would probably have been 9/10 had it not been for the ending, or rather, lack thereof. Northern Lights has one of the most memorable endings to a first part of a trilogy, and frankly, I was surprised at its removal, as Lyra walking across a bridge into the stars is one of the most cinemascopic images I can think of. The original ending where Lyra realises her ultimate betrayal is one of the most character developing experiences of the trilogy; the novel ends on an intensely climactic and poignant note. Instead we get a clichéd disneyfied ending with a rather trite and unmemorable monologue that dwindles until the credits roll in. Does Hollywood have an aversion to endings that aren't sickly sweet? Was it an attempt to make the movie more 'kiddy-friendly'? Whatever the reason, it took away the main emotional impact of the film; it's like having Frodo go back to the Shire and live happily ever after. It doesn't work. And if these scenes appear in film two, how is it going to open with the death of a child? I felt cheated and disappointed, a shame as the movie up until that point had been so successful.",The Golden Compass
266,robot4775643281,A Typical Revenge Fantasy,2,15 February 2008,"This movie is so funny, stupid, and absolutely pathetic. It poses no threat to Christianity, and it was also a box-office flop. The movie is a complete rip-off from the Chronicles of Narnia and the author of the book series it was based upon is an atheist (meaning he doesn't believe in God). Well if Philip Pullman's revenge fantasy is about ""killing God"" then why does he deny His existence? It sounds pretty insane to kill someone whom you believe doesn't exist.This movie is a perfect way to teach your kids to hate Christians. Philip Pullman and Matthew J. Murray go hand-in-hand.

We accept the fact that it was ""Hollywoodised"" (which generally ruins a film.) The spin doctors behind productions tend to ruin everything. This time they slipped up badly. There is no emotional content. I didn't shed a single tear - I didn't even yawn, it was so flat. The costumes and sets and appearance were fantastic. But there was never a feeling of threat or danger. The kidnapped children were taken to a beautiful school, well fed, well clothed. The super-confident heroine was all over the bad guys like a rash - they didn't have a hope of being really evil. The bear was a beautiful bit of CGI but treated with contempt - so predictable. This film will stick about because it is ""safe"" for the kids to watch. When the school kids get restless, the teachers can put the DVD on and let them watch without much to worry about. I'm sure the commercial goodies will sell well in the toy-shops. This (yawn) film shows why the kids are not heading to the cinemas in droves. They get more fun playing on the P.C.",The Golden Compass
268,chibifiedeyes,Pretty good,8,28 December 2007,"Whilst the movie didn't really hold suspense or recapture the book to its full potential, I thought they did a fair job. To my great relief, the script writers didn't change the story into something quite different (poor Harry Potter) but stuck close to the original plot line although some events were left out. I presume this is because the movie was already lengthy.One of the biggest point scorers here was that the movie actually made sense. Much of the vital information was recounted at the beginning of the film. Whilst this removes some suspense and development, the movie can be viewed by all, not only people who have read the book (although that would be recommended anyway) I was surprised how well the casting actually fit into their characters. Nicole Kidman's performance was amazing and she really went into character. Eva Green was also an excellent choice. Her appearance and voice give a more exotic feel. Dark hair, pale skin and big eyes really helped her to fit into the role of the witch queen.Dakota Blue Richards did a fair job. I didn't feel she really brought the character of Lyra to life but she did have some good moments too. Daniel Craig as Lord Asriel does not seem like the right fit to me, not exactly giving off the feel of intellect. However he seems to hold some of the commanding feel of Lord Asriel, which helped.For those who are worried about religious undertones, never fear! It is only hinted at several times, very subtly. For those who have never read the book, those undertones will probably slip by without notice.Definitely a recommended watch for lovers of fantasy!",The Golden Compass
269,movietode,Well worth watching even if not the greatest,9,20 April 2009,"I am giving it a higher rating in a hope to pull up the ranking a bit. There are other films that deserve a low rating. This film is certainly much much much better than the film adaptation of The Seeker: The Dark Is Rising. At least in this film, I felt the characters had enough depth to keep me interested. The problem is that it is very difficult to abridge a series with so much detail and subplots into a single movie. I am very disappointed at the details that were lost, but I will accept this movie as a graceful cut-down of the real stories. Let's remember that the Tolkien movies were considerably cut down and a lot of good character building stuff was traded for blood and guts. At least in that case the producers knew they could spread over several movies. There were several factors that I am sure contributed to Compass's failing. First of course, the movie story was chopped to the point that only a person who has read all the books would be able to try to appreciate it. Second, the movie was not constructed in a way that would make a sequel obvious. Third Combine that with the fact that the children will age too fast for a sequel and you have big problems. What I will hope is that someone will see the potential to try again, perhaps as a BBC TV mini-series. I disagree with some who said Nicole Kidman was underutilized. I thought she was perfect. In fact all of the casting worked well in my opinion. 'Tis a shame, with more money, better screenplays and this cast and effects team it would have been possible to produce works to rival Harry Potter.

Words fail me on how pointless an exercise this movie was. Where was the entertainment value? Credible storyline? Interesting characters? The idea that people just tag along for the ride to fight the bad guys, yes that was very successful in 80's cartoons. Why would it still work on anyone beyond a 7 year old? If only they had one interesting character, but alas no. f all the characters were molded into one - it would still not equate to one likable/credible person. I understand it was based on a book, and had to summarise quickly the characters. But still it doesn't explain why the pace of the movie moves from a snails crawl at the beginning to lightening speed near the end where all sorts of lucky coincidences and bizarre events happen. With no rhyme or reason. I hope this is a case of where the book was a lot better than the film.",The Golden Compass
271,hyrumnephi,Wait for DVD release or be prepared for a 'blah' experience.,5,30 November 2007,"Moved a little too quickly, characters were presented with little background, such as Sam Elliott's character, or the Ice Bear, and then the audience is immediately expected to care about them. I thought we could of been introduced to the characters a little better. Also seemed like the movie didn't flow well. I guess it's always a challenge when taking a large novel and trying to condense it into a 2 hour movie. LOTR accomplished this beautifully while this movie did not.Along the same lines, people unfamiliar with the book may struggle trying to learn all the terms and concepts associated with the movie. Knowing the terminology of the movie is important in order to keep up with the plot, and those that miss something may be left behind.Not all was negative however, the acting was actually quite good. Daniel Craig teamed up with his Bond girl again and they were both excellent in their respective roles. I though Ian McClellan (sp) as the voice of the ice bear was an interesting choice. The lead actress that played the girl did a nice job.The movie also was quite nice visually, for example the ice bear fight was nicely done, and I liked the effect of when a daemon dies.In summary, I found myself moving around in my chair often during the movie wondering when it would end. Some scenes grabbed my attention, and maybe I'll think about some of the characters again, but overall I kind of walked out with that 'blah' feeling.",The Golden Compass
272,tomhbrand,"Could Have Been Worse, Should Have Been Better",5,9 December 2007,"It's a bit of a disappointment really. Knowing the books and look at all of the pre-release material that came out I had rather had high hopes for this adaptation for the first in Phillip Pullman's Northern Lights trilogy. The casting seemed perfect, the look, from what I'd seen, matched the feel of the books. And, to be fair, director Chris Weitz hasn't made a bad film as such, it's just that he hasn't made a very good one either.The look of the film is excellent, and where it doesn't quite match up exactly with how I picture it, it still works perfectly. The art team has managed to capture the essence of Lyra's world being the same as our but different as opposed to ours in the past, which was a danger. But despite all this up until the last act the film is flat and uninteresting, arousing none of the intrigue and wonder that the books used to pull you in.I think the main problem here is the same thing that happened to the Harry Potter novels once they were adapted. To fit the novel into a film has meant the plot has been left in but all the fleshing out that makes Pullman's books so engrossing is left out, and this basically leaves the characters flat and uninteresting and your left with the feeling that Weitz is relying on the fact that the audience has already read the book so he doesn't need to flesh out the characters too much. Characters such as Serafina Pekkala appear briefly and seem simply there as a brief moment of fan service and because later in the story they need to have been established. Weitz seems to have been to scared to make too many changes in the plot to make it fit a film and the characters have suffered.Which strikes me as odd as Weitz's previous film, About A Boy was all about the characters and a good film, so we know he can direct good characters and with Compass it's only when the action picks up that the film develops and real pace and excitement. The fight between the Armoured Bears and the battle between the witches, soldiers and Gyptians both look amazing (the sight of each character's dæmon vanishing in a swirl of golden dust as a they die is incredibly effective in showing the horror of the battle without any gore.) Other than that there just a few moments where you just get the feeling that the studio was calling the shots over the directors head. The unnecessary opening monologue, reminiscent of Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, introduces aspect of the world, from the Armoured Bears to the concept of parallel universes so there is no joy of discovery for the audience as we now know it all already. Despite promises that the parts of the book discussing religion would not be ignored but done subtly so as not to cause offence, it seems to have been ignored completely so not to cause offence, something I can only see causing either big problems in the last two books (if they make it into movies) or big rewrites of the story.So all in all The Golden Compass is not a bad adaptation of the book, and it is not a particularly bad film. In a lot of ways it could easily have been a lot worse, and if you're a fan then it's a pretty good bet you'll enjoy yourself. It's just it seems to me with a little more effort and confidence it could have been so much better.",The Golden Compass

I looked up Nicole Kidman's and Dakota Blue Richards's filmographies and I see no projects to make a sequel so I guess that's the end of it.I think the producers should have been less ambitious.

275,razorsharp2505-1,Northern Lights Gone South,2,20 April 2008,"Having not been able to get into the His Dark Materials books, I was hoping the first film adaptation might offer me a glimpse as to what all the fuss is about. I didn't find it here.Possibly the worst aspect of the film had to be the screenplay. From the very beginning, the movie felt rushed. The dialogue felt contrived and unnatural and ideas and concepts were introduced so quickly and without exploration, that as a viewer I was left confused and uninterested. I love a movie with depth and a story to switch your brain on. This time I was so unengaged that switched off completely. The acting was stiff, as though the cast had to rush through their character development at the same speed as the story. I found I didn't like or care about Lyra, the young girl at the centre of the story. This was mostly because there was no proper back story nor time for her personality to shine through. Also, I love Ian McKellan but was not enamoured by his overly booming vocals for Iorik Byrnison. The directing was amateurish with poorly executed camera angles in many scenes that detracted from the activity on screen. Add to this the choppy editing and you've got a film that doesn't flow well at all.There were some elements to the Golden Compass that I felt were worthy of praise, namely the special effects for the daemons and the costume design. Those two aspects alone, however, were not enough to save the film and I doubt that anyone would see a film purely based on this anyhow. Save your time, effort and money until a better adaptation comes along.",The Golden Compass
276,Chris Clazie,A let down,6,7 December 2007,"Saw this yesterday,and was looking forward to it because of having seen the trailer but what a let down.Whole scenes seem to have been cut so there was very little continuation of story line.At fist sight Nicole Kidman seems to be a computerised image.Anything of real interest seems to be done as a montage so there is no development of character,and scenes that were shown in the trailer were missing from the film.People who worked in the cinema were as surprised as I was,that the film seemed to finish full fifteen minutes earlier than it was supposed to.More like a 100 minutes then a 113.All I can presume is that a lot of footage already shot has been carried over for part2,so what remains is like a Walt Disney adventure film from years back.Very disappointing.",The Golden Compass
277,kellyfacebook1,All that glitters ain't Golden.,4,4 May 2008,"Being a fan of the fantasy genre I was quite looking forward to seeing The Golden Compass. Even though some people might roll their eyes and tut when I say this I admit I was hoping for a new Lord of the Rings, a sprawling fantasy trilogy I could look forward to seeing each year. Unfortunately this offering was a big letdown. I never thought I'd say this but I think the root of the problem with this movie was it wasn't long enough! I kept wondering if the version I was watching had been edited by some p*ssed up media studies student as it appeared disjointed a best and ridiculous at worst. Simply not enough time was allocated to fit in all the elements that would make the story work. Lyra goes from being an urchin to Mrs Coulters assistant to meeting up with the Gyptians all in about 40 minutes. It felt like the writers and director knew certain key scenes from the book they wanted to touch upon but didn't give a crap about the narrative connecting them. That's not all that lets this film down sadly. Some of the central performances are also quite poor with Dakota Blue Richards being the most obvious. I feel bad saying that as I realise it's her first leading role but I have to be honest. Easily the most annoying of her portrayal was her inability to settle on an accent so seemed to me to be doing a poor Eliza Doolittle impersonation. The other actors seem to get so little screen time its hard to offer a proper critique. When LOTR: The Fellowship of the Ring first came out one review I read said that it has raised the bar for fantasy movies and all others which follow would and should be measured against it. Unfortunately The Golden Compass cannot compete.",The Golden Compass

Lucky? Yes, lucky, because I'm gonna enjoy both - movie AND books. Only I already enjoyed the movie this weekend.I don't have any idea, what the books are about (except general synopsis), neither I know if the authors were able to deliver some ""deep"" sense and philosophy. I know only that I fell in love with brave little Lyra, with her ever cutest daemon Panteleimon, and of course - polar bears. The atmosphere of the movie is amazing. All those little and not so little details makes you believe in Lyra's world - Magisterium, and daemons, and witches, and gypsies and alternatives sources of energy...Ms. Nicole Kidman as Mrs. Caulter is... well, not so evil as I expected, but tres charming and of course quite dangerous (though her daemon monkey is much more dangerous, and much more disgusting:)). But bears, or those bears... I have never ever seen anything as beautifully and realistically 3D modeled. And the fight between the bears is definitely the movie's jewel.The only disappointing thing was the ending, especially knowing the fact, that they still haven't started filming the sequel.In conclusion - I'm really sorry for those guys, who already read the book, and were disappointed, because movie is not like it at all (probably, because I don't know yet). And I'm really happy for everyone else including me, who loved the movie, and now going to love the book - because they'll definitely read it afterwards.",The Golden Compass
279,kyle-florence,Shallow but engaging,7,21 March 2008,"First off, I'm not familiar with the books, so I'm basing this review on the movie alone. I find it very hard to get into fantasy films and I usually grade tough, but this one was somewhat of an exception.While the story line of this film was on the same level of complexity as say, Stardust, I think it was executed much better. The story was indeed very shallow, but it was easy to follow and there weren't too many annoying made-up words thrown in there. There is enough depth to make the viewer care about the main characters and get them involved in the story that unfolds, which is the most important thing. There are also ample amounts of interesting side characters thrown in the mix, my favorites being the ever great Sam Elliott and the polar bear.Aside from the script, the acting and film direction were great. The films pace seemed just about right and the visuals were fantastic. I loved the effects used for dying souls, it was especially neat in the battle scenes.All in all an enjoyable film, although the storyline was pretty shallow and it's easy to see the film is aimed at kids. In my opinion the acting in this film as well as the general storyline were better than Stardust, but they each hold their own in certain areas as Stardust was a much deeper film.",The Golden Compass

They can't get it exactly the same, with the same amount of detail. Otherwise the movie would be a great deal longer and nobody has the time or budget for that, do they?
Now that we've got that covered, this movie had me on the edge of my chair and fully engaged the whole time. The dialogue and world building was of course in part due to the original stories, but the adaptation fit perfectly for a movie and the movie itself was absolutely stunning. The scenery and cinematography was on spot, the editing was beautifully paced, and the CGI is classic 2007 CGI- not very convincing now but, the voice actors did a wonderful job.

281,clements1991,WTF? ending,6,31 December 2007,"You may think that from my summary that I'm about to slate it.But I'm not; I can honestly say that I enjoyed this film. It looked spectacular and it was incredibly well acted. A very enjoyable family film. If you haven't read the book then I'd probably give this film a 9/10I didn't mind it when the Alethiometer was aka'd as a golden compass (it is not a compass - read the British publication 'Northern Lights') and there were a few little differences that were perfectly acceptable to make the film work.But anyone who sees this after ever reading the book will hear the victorious monologue and hear the triumphant music and you'll be begging it not to end - why? Because it's to early!In the book they find Lyra's father who then kills Roger and opens the way into the universe that holds the subtle knife. Yes it would have been a sadder ending but it's the correct ending nonetheless. It's how it should have ended, not just to please the many who have read and loved the book, but also to make the sequel make sense.I still recommend this film to be seen and I will definitely watch 'The Subtle Knife' when it arrives, but now you're prepared.PS. look out for the rat ;)",The Golden Compass
282,Simon D.,What did we expect!,5,1 November 2008,"Northern Lights (the non US title of the book), is an epic book all on it's own, even before you consider it's place in an even greater epic trilogy. It would have been an exception to the rule, if this movie of such an epic yarn, had been anything more than average. Do I listen to myself?...No, I don't, and like many other lovers of this trilogy, I was excited to see the 'LOTR' treatment applied to it. Unfortunately, despite considerable attention to sets and costumes, the overall ambiance was subdued compared to my enjoyment of the book.I won't hark on about what was wrong, as most, if not all, has been said in previous 'user comments' on this site. Instead I will just credit the positives. A lot of the casting was excellent, including the lead role. I don't know if reference had been made to the excellent full cast audio book recording of the book (the unabridged non BBC version), but I was amazed at the closeness, without being a carbon copy, of the interpretation of Lyra. Several other roles can be similarly compared to that audio production, including Mrs Coulter and Lee Scorsby. I urge you not to bother with the BBC Radio 4 production of this trilogy, as unusually for the BBC, it fell well below par.Here's my underlying thought. If you are going to attempt to recreate a piece of literature of such epic proportions, you cannot do it in under 2 hours of runtime. To have the respect of the people who had read the books, and movie goers alike, it needed to have flowed better, with more time for character development. It also needed more contrasting dramatic elements. For all of this, it needed to be at least 2 and a half hours long, and possibly even around 3. The argument against this, is probably going to be, that it was a movie aimed at the family, and then you have the job of keeping younger ones entertained, and that's the heart of why this movie is nothing more than yet another average cinema record of the key scenes from a great book. Despite many children reading the books, to fully appreciate all the levels contained within it, you needed an adult outlook. The movies completely missed these more complex themes...so why do they bother?",The Golden Compass
283,randall2,Good casting and CGI. Best if you haven't read the books.,9,9 December 2007,"The casting and performances were good and the CGI was great ... I love the bears... but my enjoyment of it was influenced by the expectations I brought to it having just read the books. I don't understand the reason for many of the plot changes, nor do I understand why they did not choose to make a slightly longer movie in order to develop the story more completely. As it is, they cut so much that a lot of background had to be served straight rather than unfolded for the audience. Still, it is well worth seeing and if you haven't already read the book, that won't be a problem. I plan to see the movie again, and look forward to seeing the rest of the trilogy.",The Golden Compass
284,temo,Beautiful and Engaging...only a few minor problems,8,1 December 2007,"First off the sets and costumes used for this film, as well as the cg effects were amazing. It was obvious that someone was paying close attention to the novel and that in itself is impressive.The cast was sensational. Nicole Kidman couldn't have been more perfect as Mrs. Coulter. Add in Derek Jacoby and Sam Elliot and you can't go wrong. Young Lyra was adorable and believable as a resourceful, adventure seeking heroine.**************Spoilerish********************** I was disappointed in the dialog. The need to spell things out seemed silly and stilted. ""If you get smacked, I feel it too."" (or something close). This is beautifully illustrated 2 scenes later and made the point much better.It's forgivable, because they did try to incorporate most major characters and plots...that was a momentous undertaking in and of itself.*********************Spoilers for those who read the book************The movie was restructured...again this is understandable, but the end had me literally screaming ""That's not the end...that can't be the end."" But it was...Lyra doesn't meet her father and deliver what he needs. I was completely dumbfounded. There was also an inexplicable implication that children who received the 'little cut' could be helped...so that makes me wonder about The Subtle Knife.******************End Spoilers********************* I enjoyed the film...but have know idea if it would make sense without reading the novel.

285,suewhitfield,Disappointing,7,8 May 2008,"This movie, as far as it goes, is good. The special effects, the costumes and the acting is all great. But if you've read the ""His Dark Materials"" trilogy you will be very disappointed. Pullman, in his books, lends such a feeling of great atmosphere and gives so much background to his characters. We are given a good deal of information about the motivation of the characters and their emotions and feelings.The movie misses most of this, skipping rapidly from scene to scene with a speed which left me breathless. How anyone can glean anything from the story if they've just seen the movie but not read the books, I will never know.I did enjoy the movie. But only because I'd read the books. And I was disappointed by the movie. But only because I'd read the books.",The Golden Compass
286,effiegraceharrington,That is not the Lyra I know,2,20 June 2021,I not like it because Lyra in the book and the show is so different the Lyra in the show is tough and this Lyra looks like she just got out the shower the Lyra I like is a flame she evolve and this Lyra doesn't do anything.,The Golden Compass
287,steve2901,I was surprised.,8,1 March 2008,"I was dreading going to see this film. I am a fan of the books, and I was, at first, eagerly anticipating this movie. However, after I'd read several mixed reviews and seeing the IMDb rating of 6.5, I put it off because I'd heard that fans of the book had been greatly disappointed.In the end, I did see it and, probably because I went in with low expectations, was pleasantly surprised. I actually really enjoyed it. It was nowhere near as dreadful as the Harry Potter movies, most of which were fairly mediocre, bar the Order of the Phoenix.I do admit, some of the characters seem pretty flat, such as Serafina Pekkala and Lord Asriel. I really enjoyed Sam Eliot as Lee Scorseby, my favourite character from the books, and Nicole Kidman is great as the sinister Mrs Coulter. Dakota Blue Richards, who I thought was terrible from the previews, proved me wrong. Unlike Harry Potter, where in the first two films the child leads are wooden and such bad actors you cringe watching them, she nails her performance straight away - she is Lyra Belaqua.I wasn't disappointed by the script (except for the ending, which is the only thing in the film that made me angry) because, I know from experience that they can't fit everything in the book into a film and things will be rearranged for narrative purposes, but it is still pretty much true to the book, except for said ending. However, there were a few scene I thought were hilarious without meaning to. At one point, Mrs Coulter is looking at a picture of Lyra and her daemon tries to wrestle it out of her hands, so she slaps it, then cries and tells him she would never hurt him. The next is in the intercision room, where she walks in on Lyra about to be separated from Pantalaimon, and slo-mo-oh-noes over to the switch to turn the machine off. The next is the scene immediately after as she tells Lyra she's her mother. I could just hear the whole Darth Vader/Luke conversation going on in my head and I laughed so much.Another thing I didn't like was the score. It just made so many scenes funny because it was so bad, such as one of the many Lyra's-been-captured scenes which feature fast, high-pitched screeches of violins coupled with Lyra's screaming which just make you burst out laughing.I really hope they do make adaptions of The Subtle Knife and The Amber Spyglass, but I hope they make them longer, like The Lord of the Rings, because His Dark Materials really isn't a story that can be told in three 2 hour parts. It's much deeper than that, and New Line need to make a film that the critics and the public will enjoy. I'm also hoping that Chris Weitz produces the proposed extended cut - although I enjoyed the Golden Compass, it would be nice to have a more complete film than there is here.The controversy over supposed ""turning kids atheist"" is nonsense - the books are not an atheistic work. And the film doesn't even mention the word God. HDM is about thinking for yourself - not ""don't believe in God because the idea of God is ridiculous"" - but challenge why it is you believe what you believe (not necessarily religion). And it's fictional - don't think that kids are stupid, it's their choice what to believe, not The Catholic League's.",The Golden Compass
288,david-beukes,"Good FX, though",2,5 January 2008,"The problem with this movie is not with its cast (with the possible exception of the consistently awful Nicole Kidman). Nearly all acquit themselves very well.Nor is it with the special effects. Readers of the book will be relieved to hear that the bear fight is as epic as could be hoped.Rather, the problem is a crap script, and tedious pacing. The film fails to engage. Its narrative relies on the assumption that you've already read the book and are simply in the audience to see the fantasy world realised.And indeed, if this is the case, you will not be overly disappointed: the visuals are stunning. It's just that the work is badly adapted, and slow. I spent most of the movie wishing, if they weren't going to bother to tell the story could they just get on with the good bits already? It's almost as if the film knows it sucks: by leaving out the climax of the book - and thus neatly avoiding your expectation of a sequel - the film acknowledges its utter failure to engage you.",The Golden Compass
289,drillbitz03,Disappointing,3,7 January 2008,"The only reason I watched this movie was that a few of my friends wanted to. Since I was incredibly bored that day, spending time with my friends seemed to be the best idea. I wasn't looking forward to it, however, The Golden Compass absolutely wreaked of a Chronicles of Narnia wannabe. The story takes place in a magical society where all people have a special connection to creatures called 'daemons,' who are essentially extensions of their souls. These daemons are so deeply connected to people that the person will feel the pain and emotion of their daemon, and vice versa. If the person dies, so does the daemon. Logic and common sense aside, the director (Chris Weitz) pulled a major Star Wars: Episode 1 and completely relied on the spectacular CGI effects and action sequences to carry the movie. The plot is very poorly developed. OK, so this girl is given a magical compass that discerns the truth in anything she asks. Why? Going further, why is this ""Magisterium"" so heavily against what her father is seeking? Where do the armored bears come into play and why are they so critical to the plot? There are far too many questions to ask and this movie leaves many of them unanswered. Even though it's obvious by the end that this is only the first part of a larger story, the entire thing left me unsatisfied. I was too bored to sleep through it and too disappointed to be interested. I'm generally not someone who goes to a movie seeking a valid plot and storyline, I like movies that take me along for the ride. I like movies that make me feel good, or evoke emotions. This movie did none of the above.",The Golden Compass
290,brankoburcksen,"His Dark ""City""",9,7 December 2007,"""The Golden Compass"" shares two distinct qualities with the 1998 film ""Dark City"" about a man who wakes up without any memories: both move at a very fast pace and tackle complex themes like free will and the essence of humanity. First and for most, ""Compass"" seeks to entertain and absolve viewers from daily life, just the same as all escapist films do. Beyond that, it pushes the boundaries of what cinema says about our ourselves and the world. (When are institutions wrong? What defines our universe? What are our souls, and what do they say about us?) The ideas brought up in the film never cover the surface of the plot because too much of it derails from the core element of the story, Lyra. Too many films nowadays push past the two hour mark to lengthen action sequences, exposition and character introductions. Chris Weitz broke the pattern by lifting out anything that could set the movie on autopilot. ""Dark City"" follows the same rubric: enough action to generate thrillers, dialogue to inform and character development to understand but not hinder or overreach. ""The Golden Compass"" satisfies the unique way by giving enough story and ideas to refresh us from the common stream, and leaves out what stops us from thinking about it on our own.",The Golden Compass
291,marc-262,Nice visuals - boring storytelling,3,1 December 2007,"The Golden Compass was one of the most anticipated films of the year. With a budget well north of $150 million and a best seller as source material, expectations were high. Despite all of the debate about the His Dark Materials books, the trailers made this film look like an awesome adventure fantasy. All I can say is ----- yawn.Yes, some of the visuals work, but most look like set pieces. The integration level for many effects is low. Despite similar budgets, LOTR blows this film out of the water on every level. Compare any battle scene in LOTR with any battle scene in The Golden Compass and you will see what I mean. I never felt that Lyra was ever truly in peril.The worst problem is the storyline. Screenwriter Chris Weitz significantly deviates from Pullman's book -- stopping very short of the dramatic conclusion of the first book in Pullman's series. I know that he was ordered to tone down the anti-Christian content of the novels, but instead of merely sanitizing the screenplay, he leaves out the climax. The scenes feel disjointed and you never get a chance to really care about any of the characters.There are a lot of transition/traveling scenes and director Chris Weitz (yes, he bears double blame for this disaster) commits the ultimate cinema sin -- he spends too much time telling and not enough time showing. Even the scenes with the alethiometer become repetitive and tiresome.Dakota Blue Richards does a creditable job as Lyra Bellaqua, but those expecting Daniel Craig (as Lord Asriel) to have much screen time will be horribly disappointed. He barely appears. Christian groups will not have to do any picketing to make this film tank. I cannot imagine anyone wanting to sit through it twice. Once was more than enough for me. Don't waste the money -- certainly not full price. If you want to see a truly magical film this holiday season, see Enchanted instead.",The Golden Compass
292,sweavo,"Flawed script, but Pullman's work could not be completely crushed",6,21 December 2007,"It's a mistake to compare the film with the book, since such a detailed, nuanced, and multi-layered book would wind up as a film of many hours. Ruthless cutting and re-arranging of material is needed to produce a movie that stands up on its own merits, which this film almost does.The biggest problem I have with this film is the first 10 minutes, in which too much is explained, even to the point of actually containing spoilers! An unforgivable number of elements were simply explained in voice-over or in clunky dialogue rather than being allowed to unfold before the viewer's eyes.""In a parallel universe..."" why tell us that?! Why not let the viewer come to the film on his or her own terms, like in the book. In the book you are dropped into Lyra's Oxford and you quickly notice that everything's not like you might expect it to be in a regular Oxford. All the explanation of Dust was unnecessary: Let dust be something mysterious and intriguing for crying out loud! Why explain about alethiometers in voice-over in the opening? Farder Coram can explain everything we need to know, and the rest can be done by SHOWING us.Visually and aurally it's a treat and, dialogue aside, is immersive and enchanting. The sound effects deserve a mention for the airships and the clockwork spy-flies. The Bear and the daemons are well realised and Nicole Kidman excels - her Mrs. Coulter is chilling, and she copes with some of her ""exposition by characters volunteering information with no apparent motivation"" lines admirably.In summary, forget about the book, forgive the first ten or fifteen minutes, and enjoy the rest of the ride!",The Golden Compass
293,WendyLauren,"Stunning performances and costuming, but the CGI and the meaning behind the story are rather weak.",8,8 December 2007,"Ultimately I was happy with the film, but I felt like they didn't take the material serious enough. Whether that was due to the fact that they wanted larger, blockbuster-type audiences, or they were nervous about the religious aspects (then why do the film at all?) I felt that they certainly could have made it a bit less childish.The casting was absolutely perfect, in fact, without the performances given in the film it probably wouldn't have been worth the money. Thank god for casting directors and actors who can to their jobs. Alright, well that is a bit harsh, but it is certainly worth saying that the performances were easily the best part of the film. Nicole Kidman is stunning as Coulter, the nuance and chilling kindness she portrays gives way to staggering ferocity and back again without missing a heartbeat. Another brilliant performance comes from Eva Green as Serafina, whose otherworldly beauty and intensity makes her seem as if she truly is a witch. I can't mention every performance, but to name a few Ian McKellen, Daniel Craig, Dakota Blue Richards, Sam Elliott and even Ben Walker as Roger all gave remarkable renditions of their characters.The costuming was perfect, as was much of the mise-en-scène including the reproduction of the alethiometer. However I felt that much of the 'dust' was far too overdone and fake to be even remotely plausible as worldly, or even otherworldly for that matter. Their use of CGI 'dust' every 10 minutes in the film gets a bit tedious, as if they're only trying to appeal to younger audiences by making the film sparkly and pretty.However, I must admit that I was happy, sad, scared out of my wits, laughing and ultimately pleased with their recreation of the text. If the next films are to be made I hope they would seriously consider adding in more serious context, because without it the books are almost pointless. To be honest a lot of my appreciation of the film came because I had the text as a backdrop. Without reading the book, the film would likely be great for kids but not so effective on older audiences. They attempted to grasp the true meaning of the books thoughts on the church and overzealous power and the 'authority' but I think they fall a bit short in that respect. Oh, and get rid of that ridiculous 'Lyra' song by Kate Bush at the end. It's horrible.7.5/10",The Golden Compass
294,windwhirl5000,"I liked it, but I think they could have made it better.",7,15 December 2007,"Since I've read the book of course the movie was no comparison. It's always like that when they make movies out of books. It was pretty good, though. I have to say that characters didn't look right at all and the voices were all wrong. Pam for instance (Lyra's Daemon) had a way to high voice that was probably played by a girl. I never imagined Pam's voice very low, but I would never imagine it that high either. The movie also went extremely fast, except when it was a battle seen. The battles went on and on but the rest seemed to fly by. A lot was very confusing for people who haven't read the book or know the story. Lucky for me, that wasn't the case.My last complaint is that they cut off the end. Right at the part leading up to the end they suddenly blacked out the rest. They'll porbably make a sequel but I think that's kind of strange to split the book in half like that. Aw well, it was pretty good. It's worth watching.",The Golden Compass
295,Forever_21,"Kid's film, adult themes",6,30 January 2008,"I have to admit that my expectations of The Golden Compass were pretty low. I'm a fan of the books and was surprised to hear a couple of years ago that this film was going to be made; mainly due to some of the difficult themes tackled in the text and that these stories are principally aimed at kids. My reservations towards the film were centred around what I felt to be the likely dilution of these themes, but now I've seen the film and after consideration I've concluded that Chris Weitz has done a good job in the face of controversy.This is not to say I'm entirely happy, the story's main themes are present and the key plot elements are woven in to a well paced film but I still felt Weitz could have followed the text more closely. Although much of the avoided references involve the abduction and abuse of children, I still think this could have been explored further whilst staying within the realms of good taste.Book comparisons aside The Golden Compass is a good film for kids even if they don't fully appreciate the messages and themes. Dakota Blue Richards does a sterling job portraying Lyra as a determined and head-strong girl on what is an epic journey across continents. If you haven't read the book then you need to have your wits about you as the story whips along at a fair old pace and it may become difficult to follow.Nicole Kidman does a fair job at portraying the mysterious Marisa Coulter, Daniel Craig as Lord Asriel has little screen time but he is convincing enough. Sam Elliott makes for a brilliant Lee Scoresby although he looks nothing like I had imagined.The CGI is average, some of the vehicles in Lyra's world are unconvincing but the animal daemons (physical projections of people's souls in Lyra's world) are all pretty good. The highlight however is the armoured bears and in particular Lyra's companion and protector Lorek Byrnison voiced wonderfully by Ian McKellen. There is plenty of action to keep you awake and there are some spectacular set pieces.Unfortunately all of this doesn't help distract from the feeling that this film was cut viciously to get it well within the 2 hour mark and that the story does suffer as a result. Perhaps a more forgiving director's cut is on the horizon, I hope so. I also hope that Weitz is given the chance to complete his interpretation because all flaws aside I did enjoy watching this film.",The Golden Compass
296,CarolWolf,A failure of courage,2,11 December 2007,"This film was a disappointing adaption of a beautiful and powerful book. The adaption seems to suffer from a loss of nerve (and fear of loss of revenue) in facing the courageous themes of the book. The story has been dumbed down to make it suitable for the children of fools. If the producers were so afraid of this story not appealing to audiences (despite the extensive popularity of the book), then why make it at all? The book is complex and thought-provoking. This film has been watered down until it is basically about, Girl with magic thingy goes off to save two of her friends, and lots of people help her on the way. Sort of like...Harry Potter.The production values were beautiful and expensive. The bear was great (though shouldn't he have a deeper voice?). But endless important points were changed for no reason, and in the end, the film story leaves one cold. A far cry from the book that one could not put down, nor ever forget. It's as though the writer didn't like the book much.A second-rate writer got hold of a first-rate story, and brought it down to his own level. It's a shame.

There was a tremendous amount of traveling and dramatic running/chase scenes but not a lot of explanations or in-depth character development. It is possible that they were saving the character development for the rest of the never-to-be-created trilogy, but the whole movie appears to be propped up on effects and the idea of a wonderful story. I absolutely loved the premise of the movie - who doesn't like the idea of being able to speak to your soul that is represented by an animal?

299,dalemarshall,visually stunning,10,23 December 2007,"It's true that the film doesn't do justice to all the developments and nuances of the book, but given the amount of material to be covered, that's not surprising. What is gratifying is that there is enough exposition to give us a coherent story, and it's beautifully done. The cinematography and lighting are outstanding; the CG imagery amazing and lifelike; and the camera angles, especially on transition shots, are often disturbing in a way that sweeps us along. Weitz moves the plot along by *showing* us what we need to know, rather than telling us about it. I can't wait to see (and buy) the director's cut, to see all the footage he was forced to leave out of the release. I hope there is more with Tom Courtenay in there, because he (as Farder Coram) was given short shrift with the time constraints. The acting is superb, with Lyra a standout. I was disappointed in Nicole Kidman's portrayal of Mrs. Coulter. Her performance lacked the depth and edge that another actor could have provided. And why was she blonde? The film was more violent than most I choose to see, but all the violence was integral to the story, necessary, and a reminder that children's lives are often not the sanitized, pleasant existence we like to pretend they are -- and that children themselves can in fact cope with courage and optimism. Scenes of tussles between daemons can be shocking, and the bear fight was outstanding. There is no spattering of blood or gratuitous violence. The film is beautiful and satisfying, and I hope the sequels live up to the standards exhibited here.",The Golden Compass
300,mikal9300,Excellent!,10,7 December 2007,"This movie by far sets the standard for all these children/young teen book adaptations that are coming out. I hope Spidewick Chronicles follows suit of this film. This film is great from beginning until end. A new world is cast upon you and the way in which things ""are"" is set up perfectly for you and you are not left feeling left out. From demons to flying machines and battling polar bears, this movie has it all. The story line is a good one and is paced very well. The polar bear is a great character. I don't really want to give anything away, but I loved the movie and anyone who likes the Potter films or Narnia will indeed enjoy this, if not more so, I know I did.

301,designprodigy,spectacular!!!,9,18 December 2007,"Although I must admit I am quite a fan of Phillip Pullman's writing... and was SO excited to see this movie... I was OUTRAGED that religious zealots were trying to see it banned due to reports that ""god dies"" in it... which is absolutely not true... I mean you have to take into consideration that it is a work of FICTION.. and that obviously the occult undertones of Harry Potter stories went unchallenged by these same fat heads.. but in the completion of the trilogy you will see the scale spin ever grander to encompass everything that is and was... The Golden Compass follows Lyra to the truth She must face... not really revealed in the movie as it happens that had they done that, the movie would have ended with Lyra's friend dying and that just wouldn't be a ""happy"" ending... The Subtle Knife follows the adventures of Will, who is Lyra's age and from OUR dimension as he discovers a rip in the fabric between our dimension and another that Lyra has found herself entering at the end of the written version of The Golden Compass... This is where they learn more about the matters at hand which Lyra has been exploring and it is here that Will becomes the bearer of the Subtle Knife... a kind of mythical object that cuts the holes between dimensions, enabling them to escape capture at the hands of the determined Mrs Coulter or anyone else thats after the two of them... all the while trying to discover what the hell happened to Will's father... And into the third and final book The Amber Spyglass... in which they rescue the now dead Roger from the depths of hell.... as the trilogy progresses the war between heaven and earth ensnares all people from all dimensions and all aspects of life.. it refers to a god who has been in a sort of suspended animation for 30,000 years and his head angel who has ruled all of creation ever since... the ""vegetable god"" eventually has his ""plug pulled""... and so THATS what these zealots are getting bent out of shape about... now, I think in this day and age we should reward those with the talent and intelligence to write a good story, especially since this is the greatest story I have ever read.. not feel threatened by the possibility that original thoughts might be produced in our children by it... ORIGINAL THOUGHTS are few and far between! I think these ""concerned parents"" are overestimating their children's' intelligence!!!! Ray Bradbury wrote a story in the Martian Chronicles that describes a situation where book burning attitudes damn those responsible to die in ways that are described in the works of Edgar Allen Poe... a fitting warning to those who choose ignorance.... which is only bliss for so long...

I had heard that there was something with the Christian community, catholics in particular who disliked this film because it showed the corruption of the Church. I myself am Catholic but I did not see that connection in the film. I think that Daniel Craig played the Lord Asriel part great but I am a fan of Jason Isaacs and I think he would have done a little better job.

I especially like the daemons that everyone had & of course, Iorak Byrnison, the Ice Bear King. Dakota Blue Richards did an excellent job portraying Lyra; she is one of the best child actors that I've seen in awhile.

304,unarob,Few things to sort out,9,21 December 2007,"First... do not expect a neat and clean package. There are a few plot problems that obviously come from cuts being made. Don't expect every question to be resolved neatly. You have to (gasp) use your brain to fill in the blanks in places.. if you can live with that... move to Second... do NOT expect this film to come out of the gates quickly. It doesn't. In fact the first 15 minutes are lackluster, dry, and pretty unremarkable. You get the feeling of Uncle Joe building up to a great story by telling you about the eggs he had for breakfast. Its an integral part of the story but for the love of god get on with the tale. If you can patiently sit through the first 15-20 minutes then move to Third... if you are looking for religious outrage, or a great movie about the wonders of a secular society... sorry forget it... this movie is NOT about religion... yes the books are... this is not a book. This is a movie, and its harmless to your eternal soul. If you can live with not feeling spiritual vindication (on either side)... move to Fourth... suspension of disbelief... without it your doomed and should go see something else. Not only are there holes in the plot, some of the problems deal with world consistencies. In that I mean there are obviously rules that govern the world the movie takes place in... don't expect those rules to be consistently held.. if you have to have all your ducks in a line and the fantasy totally conform to the fantasy world... pick up Discworld... if you can live with obvious inconsistency go to ...Fifth... Decent CGI... at times amazing, but ....OK long story short... lots of buts and qualifiers. Some obvious unresolvable issues....but in the end I was entertained... at times engrossed.

305,guildnavigator,Rushed and uneven,7,6 June 2008,"I haven't read the books.The performances of the film are steady, nothing too amazing in the acting realm.The story was weak. The direction felt rushed to me, as story elements were not discovered by characters, so much as they were told to the audience. Longer scenes when divining from the compass would've helped here. There are also problems with tracing the lines of knowledge, as sometimes I felt like characters were acting on information the audience had not seen them acquire.I loved the way archetypes were being presented, still, not enough time was taken to establish the full complexity of relationships between characters. I say this with full appreciation of the film's near two hour run time.If the Gyptians were really shadowing the girl, a few more shots of one of them giving a knowing glance here and there, like the disguised Lando in Return of the Jedi, would've helped.And, since I've broached Star Wars, the fight at the end was the worst case of green-screen-itis since Attack of the Clones.I would be very surprised if the sequels get made. They would make an excellent cartoon series or steampunk rpg.sincerely, Dave",The Golden Compass
306,JerusalemFace,"Entertaining, but missed opportunity",6,6 December 2007,"His Dark Materials: Northern Lights, the original name for the book, in the UK. What a poignant, mysterious title for a book. The Golden Compass? Well, it doesn't quite have the same impact, does it? The use of the American name of the book for the film really didn't bother me at first, but as early warning signs come, it doesn't get much more obvious than this; we should have guessed from the off that this was going to be a very different beast to the book.As a huge fan of Philip Pullman's epic trilogy, I had been eagerly anticipating this film adaptation for at least a year. I had fallen in love with the books a while back; not due to the fantastical elements, but due to the way it introduced this fantastical parallel universe to the reader in a slow, subtle, familiar way and made it feel real and tangible. The books are gritty, rugged and at times violent, and the stories' themes are philosophical and even spiritual in a way. It grieves me to say that the film misses the point; concentrating instead, on the fantasy, the action and the giant talking polar bears (panserbjorne).The story is the same: it follows the exploits of a young orphan girl, Lyra, who lives among scholars at Oxford's Jordan College, in a world parallel to our own, in which every human is joined to a physical manifestation of their soul (daemon). One day Lyra hears hushed talk of an extraordinary particle which is rumoured to possess profound properties that could unite whole universes. But there are those who fear the particle and would stop at nothing to destroy it. Children are also being kidnapped left, right and centre, and Lyra's best friend, Roger, is among them. Catapulted into the heart of a desperate struggle, Lyra is forced to seek aid from witches, gyptians, and formidable armoured bears, to help her save her friends from these evil experiments.But the soul of the story is all but gone. Gone is the mystery; the slow, developing understanding of a person's bond with their daemon; and the gentle, calm introduction to each character and their entwining relationships. Granted, such a complex story was always going to be difficult to adapt, but surely restricting it to such a short-time span (114 minutes) to tell the story just increases that difficulty. By ripping out the very things that made the novel so spell-binding and original, we're left with an ultimately quite hollow, shallow and self-conscious movie, which is more interested in showing off it's (admittedly breathtaking special effects) than telling an interesting story.The problem isn't that I've read the books. The problem is that this film is very nearly a complete disaster, even as a film unto it's own right; there is no character development, some of the dialogue is awfully contrived and the pacing is all over the shop. Virtually everything from the book is in there, in fact; it's just every scene flies by at a ridiculous pace. The characters are given no time to breathe or grow and concepts such as the daemons, Dust and the magesterium are explained to you via convoluted exposition rather than simply shown to you. The result is a rather detached feeling and thus you never care about any of the characters, which is a crying shame, considering the source from which the stories came.Oddly, despite nearly being a disaster, the film could have gone the other way - some of it teeters on perfection even. For one, it is visual eye candy, with the design departments each paying extraordinary attention to detail in their creation of Lyra's world and it is not their fault that Weitz's (or New Line's) vision differs so wildly from Pullman's description. Also, the acting itself from almost everyone is very strong, with each actor portraying the characters from the books superbly. Daniel Craig owns both scenes he's in, as Lord Asriel does in the book; Nicole Kidman's magnetic, seductive beauty is perfect for Mrs Coulter; Sam Elliott charms and delights as Lee Scoresby; and Dakota Blue Richards is every bit the lovable rogue of the Lyra of the novel. (Had there not been the need for her to be so pleonastic, the audience might even have actually cared about her).As far as entertainment goes, the whole film is actually pretty high up the scale; captivating and engrossing the audience throughout, who barely have time to catch a breath. It's a damn good spectacle, that's for sure. It's just an utter shame how great this could have been on many levels, and how as it is it's only a little better than your average family adventure film. Children from about 8-14 WILL love this, but it doesn't have the depth or layers of, say... The Lord of the Rings (the comparison was always inevitable), to not only entertain, but to excite, thrill, shock, scare, move, and even inspire viewers of all ages, like it could have done.As far as summaries go, you need just watch the film, which is over in an instant and in fact runs very much like a summary of the book. It's worth watching for the entertainment value but you'll probably have forgotten about it by tomorrow.It sounds like a pretty scathing review, but I still think the quality of the story shines through in the end, and most people will find something to enjoy on some level. It is certainly unlike anything you've ever seen: so very good and yet so very, very unsatisfactory.Must do better.",The Golden Compass
307,IxAMxWHOxIxIS,"um, it was bad",2,18 December 2007,"OK, I saw this movie yesterday. Some people wanted to see it, so hey I went. All I can say about it is that it was pure crap, both the fact that most of it is completely digital and the message that it puts out is, in the least, a wrong lesson. From what I gather, the message, people can live without their souls, or without part of their souls, is completely the wrong lesson to be taught to kids. It has no ending, and the fact that the little girl could get everything she wanted was fake. The compass has nothing to do with the other worlds at all, so I see no reason why the movie should mention them. Animals talking are bogus, and in the end, my point is, I really did not like it at all. I think its a bad lesson to put across, and people should really see it for what it is, since the splitting of the soul from the person is the main focus of the movie.",The Golden Compass

The music obnoxious and at times hopelessly counter-intuitive. The CG effort is nice, but not enough to make this pic work. The number of times the same scene, in different costumes, is repeated is beyond comprehension. The continuity mistakes are unforgivable. And just how many dps worked on this boring thing?

310,rbangert,No controversy--a great adventure! See for yourself!,10,30 December 2007,"The Golden Compass takes the viewer on a darkly engrossing and delightful fantasy adventure. The characters in the movie are sharply defined, though, given the movie's rapid pacing, not always fully realized. Mrs. Coulter (Nicole Kidman) is gut-wrenchingly evil, the oily, swarming, pleasant kind of cruel that makes your skin crawl. Her nemesis, the heroine of the story, is the plucky, tale-telling, inquisitive, and strong-willed Lyra (Dakota Blue Richards). These two deliver fine performances that interweave throughout the movie. Iorek Byrnison (voiced by Ian Mckellen), the armored bear who is won to Lyra's cause, is another outstanding character in the movie, perfectly depicted through the wizardry of computer graphics.Perhaps the most compelling part of the movie is its imaginativeness. The idea of a truth-telling compass and its visual representation in the movie is compelling and beautiful. The attention to detail in the views of this alternative world are often breath-taking, as realistic as beautiful photography of exotic lands. I must confess that I had reservations about seeing a movie were animals ""talk"" and interact intelligently with humans, but the images and fantasy characters are so authentically depicted, the viewer accepts them as valued characters in this strange world.How can this movie possibly be controversial? I have never read the books, so I have no way of judging the faithfulness of the movie to the text. But any viewer who comes to the movie out of love of the books must understand that they can't possibly expect to see their own imaginations on the screen. And there are others who have personal or religious reasons for disliking the author of the original novel. But, taking the movie at face value, it is an exciting and engrossing tale of a courageous young girl alive in a world that is quietly dominated by an institution obsessed with purifying society of certain ""errors"" of understanding. Of course, like many stories that appeal to myth, it shares themes with the Wizard of Oz, Star Wars, Harry Potter, Narnia, Eragon. If you like that kind of fantasy, you should really like this movie. The children and adults I saw it with unanimously agreed it was great.Try it for yourself!",The Golden Compass
311,clonesheep,Not worth your time,2,5 December 2007,"It's a misconception by Hollywood types that a big-budget fantasy movie with a lot of special effects, etc., will automatically attract a large audience. After all, that were what the Lord of the Ring and Horry Potter series did. Truth is, special effect can only keep the audience's attention for 10 minutes. To keep their attention for 90 minutes, there has to be a coherent story.This movie suffers what 90% of today's Hollywood movies do: Poor writing. Dialogs are devoid of any subtlety. There's no proper set up or anticipation. It's just lazy writing. Perhaps those who are intimately familiar with the original book, who already know the set up, would have a slightly more enjoyable experience watching this movie. But then again, judging by its quality, either the book itself isn't that great anyway or the movie completely failed to reflect the glory of the original. Either way, it's a failure.",The Golden Compass

Having not read the book, I can't comment on how true to the original character she or anyone else was, but I found her voice and nature so irritating and distracting throughout. In fact, aside the stars of the cast (who stuck out like a sore thumb) the acting was atrocious, cheesy and left the film feeling like it was on stage.The bear, Iorek Byrnison, was the star of the show for me. With the voice of Ian McKellen and impressive computer graphics he was all that kept me interested. But again, well achieved parts of the film stuck out from the rest and made the film seem inconsistent and confusing.The first half of the film drags on and was boring enough to send my father to sleep. It just felt like nothing really happened in the film, but to be fair I felt the same of the first in the LOTR trilogy, so will a sequel to this film improve? I don't think so, because of the miss-mash of well done and terribly done features.

314,SnowBrian,Shame on New Line Cinema!!!,5,22 December 2008,"The ""His Dark Materials"" trilogy are, by far, my all time favourite novels. I absolutely adore them and the complex, emotional themes they present. Themes which big-budget Hollywood studios will seemingly never understand.I was extremely skeptical about this film, and with good reason. The director had very little prior experience, especially for a film of this magnitude, and the producer, Debra Forte, had said things that convinced me she felt the novels were written for six-year-olds.After seeing the final cut, some of my initial fears were put to rest. Yes, some of the overtly religious references were omitted, but the Magisterium's connection to the Church was not removed from the plot at all. Removing references to something is not the same as deleting it from the story altogether, and Weitz left in just enough information to prove that part of the story would be left intact for the sequels.No, my final fears were stemmed from New Line Cinema, a studio which deserved to lose money on this film after what they did to it. Not only did the hack off the brilliant ending, they rearranged the final segments and hastily redid the special effects and added in some obviously dubbed lines to cover this up. What bothers me the most about this is how little respect they had for their director.Although Weitz talks about these changes as though he approves them, I imagine the truth of the matter is that he had no other choice but to go along with them. The video-game and all tie in material feature the original order of events and allude to the original ending, proving just what a last minute change this was.Replacing Nonso Anozie with Ian McKellen as Iorek Byrnison was another change that bothered me. Weitz actually expressed his disappointment at this decision, and I agree. McKellen is a great actor, but the only reason the studio used him was because of his name value. Having heard Nonso's voice in the video-game, I can honestly say that there is VERY LITTLE difference between their voices. New Line had so little faith in this film they felt they had to have every A-list star be in it. They were clearly the wrong studio to handle this project.I very much hope a director's cut is eventually released, because I feel I can't fairly judge Chris Weitz based on the studio cut. Much of what he did was good, but too much of the final film focuses on forced exposition that is awkwardly inserted. The rule ""Show, don't tell"" seems to have been ignored during the screen writing process. It is reported that his original draft was far superior to the final shooting script, and who knows what other filmed footage was cut besides the ending sequence, so I don't wish to blame him without all the evidence first. With more creative control, Weitz could have crafted a much better film, as evidence of his potential is shown. What irks me the most are the references to the alethiometer as a golden compass. Nowhere in the novel is it called that (since that was not Pullman's title for the piece, which was Northern Lights) and it was unnecessary for the film. It was obviously dubbed in during post-production, as the studio so overwhelmingly underestimates their audience that they feel everything must be spelled out. Trust the audience!!! We are not that stupid!!! The final problem remains with the source material. No matter who would have tackled this film, there are elements of it that simply cannot translate well to film. Pullman's narrative is slow and only reveals information as it is needed, creating a strong sense of mystery and wonder. Much of that is explained in clunky exposition in the opening narration, of which only the first few lines would have sufficed.All in all, a mixed bag. Let's hope the sequels get canceled so another studio can tackle them in a few decades or so, when they finally realize the world will accept a serious drama like this without dumbing it down to preschooler proportions.",The Golden Compass

The film's message was debated over by Christians and Atheists, condemned by the Pope for being Anti-Christmas, and ended on a cliff hanger to which there appears to be no resolution EVER coming.The movie itself was mis-marketed in America, which is where its distributor (New Line) structured their end of the film's grosses. By selling off foreign rites, they lost out on the approximately 300 million dollars abroad, versus the less than 100 million (box office) earned in the US. This blunder fast-tracked the end of the company that not only brought us The Lord of the Rings trilogy, but virtually gave birth to modern horror films.And after all of that, the most entertaining aspect of the Golden Compass is the film's message of Adult/Christian suppression of ideas, running parallel to the overt suppression placed on this film by Christian parents fearful of its message. I myself, saw nothing less than 10 mass Emails warning parents about this ""evil movie.""The movie is worth watching, but a documentary of its circumstances would be much more fascinating.OVERALL GRADE: C+BETTER MOVIES LIKE IT: Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Harry Potter Films, Chronicles of Narnia.",The Golden Compass

LOTR, Narnia, and even Harry Potter to some extent are successful in this quest. However, I am reluctant to add The Golden Compass to this list; it was lacking in the magic and ""wow"" that propelled the others to such success. Some of the sequences are downright boring and seem to be poorly incorporated into the story. I know adapting a book calls for changes and cuts, but this film feels as if it made very few of those tough choices, and, as a result, it is vague and meandering. I will give credit to the cast (especially an excellent Kidman), but there is not enough to give this film the 8-10 that a movie of this magnitude should achieve.

Very bad. Did not bother to see who has adapted the book to the movie script but I really hope he if forced to give his paycheck back. The viewer is virtually bombarded with a host of characters coming out of nowhere, doing something which you don't really know why, but in the end it turns up all this pulls the plot ahead. Watching the movie I had the feeling like someone had went through the original book and copy-pasted every 10th page into the script and then left the rest to the viewers to figure out. Nothing could have saved that movie, not Nicole kidmain, even if they had Al pacino teamed up with Angelina Jolie and Roberd deniro, they would not have pulled it.

320,fluffymarshmallowsandtof,A fair adaptation of a great story.,7,26 December 2007,"As a Pullman fanatic, I try to approach this film as objectively as I can. I hope that my review will be useful to both those who have and those who have not read the book.Unfortunately, the same things that hinder the book's translation hinder the movie as a whole- namely, the time constraints. The film was quite a bit shorter then it could have been, and as a result a lot of the depth and explanations are missing.The plot moves fairly fast, scenes quickly cut to each other. While the whole story is included, the film loses a great deal of depth. We have barely enough time to gauge what is happening in one scene, and understand the concepts before jumping to the next time and place. Pullman readers will be satisfied with most, although perhaps annoyed at the slight additions and plot changes. It also becomes difficult to fully empathise with the characters, and although moments left me slightly choked up, a look around made me aware it was probably only me with my quite in depth knowledge of the book which left it that way. I was also constantly having to explain to those around me what was going on. Normally it is looked down upon in cinemas, but even the couple sitting next to my family asked me for clarification. The opening summary does help explain some of the more complex elements of Pullman's universe, but does not carry it through adequately.I was expecting the film to suffer far more than it did from all the controversy, altering it to appease the Church, and ultimately it simply comes down to the wording. The Church becomes the Magisterium, God becomes the Authority, and the story of Adam and Eve is swapped for some random snippet about the ancestors- this move in particular makes it harder for non-readers to understand the concept of dust.I think this can best be summed up as they took a great story, and condensed it slightly too much, to make a *good* fantasy film. A little more time, a little more depth and there would have been a wonderful film here. I do hope the trilogy is made in total, but the takings and reviews, as well as how they will manage to handle the story without a scathing declaration from various Christian groups, if what has been coming out is anything to judge by.",The Golden Compass
321,Juja1,Much roaring about nothing,1,15 December 2007,"I just walked out of this movie near its end. (never walked out of a movie before). It was so boring that I had no inclination whatsoever to know how it would end, and a desire to make something better out of the evening. The special effects and costumes looked great. Also the actors did a good job. However, to me it was nothing more than just a colourful stream of images. There was nothing in it to captivate me emotionally. An action based storyline, no apparent character drivers than some displeasingly simple notions of valour and might; no apparent message, no universal human themes to which one could relate. When each picture is just a glossy brochure, and too perfect in every detail, special effects can be a real mood killer, and make the movie look phony and artificial. Always the same panoramic wide screen view of events. Why is it that many filmmakers seem to employ a pompous and pathetic music score as the only means intended to evoke emotion? Why not make more creative use of perspective, lighting, timing, realistic settings in order to drive a story emotionally from the inner perspective of a character? All in all, much roaring about nothing. A very meaningless movie.",The Golden Compass
322,Aemaeth,Much Better Than I Expected...,8,10 December 2007,"Let's remember that a film critic's job is to rate the quality of a film as a film, often weighed against film history as a whole. To that end, ""The Golden Compass"" is certainly not perfect. Furthermore, anyone entering a cinema with the attitude that a movie MUST MUST MUST be entirely faithful to the book on which it was based is doomed to disappointment-movies are not books, and they never will be. One simply must acknowledge that nuance will be lost (actually I find it odd that so many loyal readers of Pullman's novels prefer to view the movie in the black and white terms of 'perfect' or 'terrible', seeing as the books are about rejecting black and white ideologies).That said, I arrived at my own cinema with reservations. I adore the books and I was afraid of another atrocity on the order of ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" (didn't like it much). But to my surprise I rather loved it. The changes made in the narrative seemed to make sense for a transfer to film medium (as in LoTR) and frankly I think it deserves some sort of prize for running under two hours long. The effects were, for the most part, dazzling, but the saving grace of the film was the cast. Young Dakota Blue Richards is quite a find, and slipped into the role of Lyra Belacqua easily if occasionally a bit limited. But Sam Elliott, Sir Ian McKellen, Ian McShane, and Eva Green really brought their characters to life. It's so rare to see such perfect casting.Admittedly, the movie is a bit clunky but I think that's to be expected. Certainly I would have liked it if the script had remained true to the anti-religious subtext of the book, but I felt that it was present, even if it was coded.In the end, if you're looking for an exciting winter diversion ""The Golden Compass"" is perfect.Further Highlights: - the very impressive fight between Iorek and Ragnar - seeing the daemons of the dead evaporate in an explosion of golden light - the subtle (and not-so-subtle) differences in Lyra's world from our own - children running in a mad pack, their daemons as animals flying or running beside them",The Golden Compass
323,keithco-95565,Never read the books.,9,22 September 2018,"I never read the books so I had nothing to compare it to. My one word description of 
""The Magic Compass:"" Magical...Loved this movie. Compared to so much other drek out there, this movie inspired admiration. Lyra was a fantastic character and held the movie together. Yes, some characters and plot lines were too predictable but the overall movie had that special magic that viewers crave. Not suitable to young children but more appropriate to children that loved Harry Potter.",The Golden Compass
324,bart-233,The Golden Compass Doesn't point in the right direction but it's a great trip.,7,2 December 2007,"For me the Golden Compass was visually pleasant and well acted but lacked direction. It was like my kids, who have read the books and I saw a different movie. I saw a fantasy adventure which left me longing for more scenes of fighting polar bears. While my kids saw, a somewhat disjointed visual presentation of a well loved book series.The casting for this series of movies is as close to perfect as I could suspect having never read the authors character exposition. Dakota Blue Richards is an absolute joy to watch. She has a natural screen presence and has adopted the Lyra Belacqua personification as a second skin. Sam Elliot as Lee Scoresby is seasoned wisdom and trial by fire rugged all rolled into ones favorite uncle. Daniel Craig bond like confidence is very limited but still commands respect. I understand this will change as Craig and Christopher Lee will get more screen time if the books interpretation holds in the mind of director Chris Weitz.For the last 24 hours I've listened to my wife and kids discuss and debate the movie interpretation. I however find I don't care about the interpretation and oddly enough about the story. Not having read the books I would expect the movie to stand on its' own. The movie should at least make me curious as to what's going on. The Golden Compass doesn't do that. I'm not asking my self the same questions about the story as the rest of my family. I just don't car about the gobblers or about the Cossack looking soldiers in the hats they borrowed from the wizard of Oz wardrobe.Quite frankly I don't care about the story line. I do however like the characters and I like the land they live and they fight in. I'm actually looking forward to the second installment. I want to see more fighting bears, more icy cold mothering from Nicole Kidman. I would love to see more interaction between Eva Green and Sam Elliott. I definitely would like to see more of the talented Dakota Blue Richards. And I don't care if it's in a parallel universe where the books take them or if they continue to hang around in the world created by Chris Weitz.The telling of the fantasy adventures lately is hit or miss. LOTR, Harry Potter both on the hit side. In both of those series I cared about the story and the success of the character to defeat the ultimate evil. Even though the acting in Harry Potter was stiff I was able to understand the direction of the plot and the intent of the story. The last Mimzy and Narnia both a complete miss, left me shaking my head in disappointment.The Golden Compass could have been called anything and I would see it for the Armored Bear Battle or the final battle or the interaction between the characters and their souls called daemons. I would see it for the great cast or the fine acting. There are lots of reasons to see this Movie. It will however make you want to read the book. I plan on reading the book so I hopefully will enjoy the movie on yet another level. Perhaps even the level on which it was intended.",The Golden Compass
325,tmed-81353,Book to movie,3,21 March 2021,Probably one of the worst movie adaptation of a book I have ever seen. I was so wanting to like this move because the book was amazing. The special effects were still good for the time.,The Golden Compass
326,jesssika23,descent enough,7,12 June 2008,"I waited to watch this movie until it was released on DVD. I was sadly disappointed. However, the movie was good. I felt that with all the hype of it being the next big trilogy, it was a let down. They left then ending open so that another could be created to follow the trilogy of books, but now there's news that they might not be making it. I felt that my time spent watching it and getting intrigued by it was a complete waste at that point. I felt that the beginning started off descent, but then they just kept ramming details that you need to know right after another without really elaborating or allowing for enough time to lapse between them to be ready for the next wave of information. After watching this very well graphicized movie, I was still tired from trying to take in all the information. You get in about 1 minute the history of the little girl and all this other history follows right after it. By the time you really start to understand what is happening, the movie has ended and you're left with questions that may or may not get answered in the movies. So, I guess for the author of the books this can be good for sales, but I like to watch and so does most of the general public. I do recommend this film for children who like a movie with animals and some humor, but without the sequels I feel this movie was a waste otherwise.",The Golden Compass
327,andy5955,"The good, the bad, and the ugly",7,15 January 2008,"**This comment may contain spoilers** Like any other fan of His Dark Materials or a book-lover, I went to the film cynical and preparing myself for the worst. However, I was rather shocked to find myself immersed in the movie after about the first twenty minutes.THE GOOD: Firstly, this film had astounding characters that really embodied the characters in the books. As with other fans of His Dark Materials, I was outraged when Nicole Kidman was announced to play Mrs Coulter in the film (the colour of her hair, people), but from the moment she appeared on the screen, I was mesmerized by her charming and rosy exterior yet venomous and cold-hearted personality, especially when she forces Lyra to obey her. With the exception of the hair, Nicole is everything Mrs Coulter is: tall, blanch, and suitably icy. Although she was not as cruel as she was in the books, Nicole Kidman certainly fills in the character. Daniel Craig as Lord Asriel was certainly very satisfying. I found myself wondering why they didn't improvise on him as I'd love to see more on how his character is fleshed out. But the one character that left my mouth hanging open was - you guessed it - Dakota Blue Richards as Lyra. Cheeky, tough, and optimistic, Dakota carries Lyra in such an astounding way that she makes the Potter kids and the children of Narnia look like crud. The whole movie essentially about her, so if she flunked it, the whole movie would flunk. Ian McKellen was wonderful as Iorek. Eva Green is wonderful as Serafina. I just hope they'll give her more screen time in the sequels. Also the effects themselves are superb: The Magisterium, the college, Bolvangar (that left shivers down my spine), a view of the city, and many more. Some scenes were perfect too: the bear fight (although I knew the outcome of the battle, I was in suspense), the intercision (I was rather terrified to see how it was actually carried out), the battle of Bolvangar (my eyes were wide open when I saw it), when Lyra reads the aleithiometer (I wasn't prepared for that), and dozens more, particularly the ending. There are many more to list, but I think that I should stop.These are the good.THE BAD: I was terribly, terribly, terribly disappointed by the storyline and plot. I wasn't too annoyed by the opening narration (which seemed to me like a blatant rip-off of LOTR) but the storyline was just too weak and had not enough detailing of the Magisterium in it, nor of other things. Like any other HDM fan, I moaned invariably when they announced watering down the religious scenes. Some scenes weren't powerful enough: Lyra not being shocked as terrified as she rushed for the wardrobe door, Lord Asriel's coldness, and many more. The beginning was fine but as the movie went on, the plot rushed about so madly that I was half-satisfied, half-unsatisfied when the movie ended. The satisfying part came from the fact that the movie thrilled me, the unsatisfied part came from the reason they had to rush it so much that if there were any who weren't fans of the books, they'd be rather confused. Even Narnia's storyline was more sturdy than it, as with LOTR and HP. The knowledge that the movie was about 2 hours did nothing to appease my annoyance at that. New Line weren't shocked at giving LOTR three hrs, why leave TGC only 2 hours? The most antagonizing thing, though, was the character development: there was none at all, and neither was there an understanding between a person and their daemon. I cannot bear to list any more bad things this movie was.Now for the ugly.THE UGLY: One of the ugliest things I found about that film was the fact that it was made in the wake of LOTR. What New Line forgot about LOTR was that it was directed by a movie-making genius, whose films already proved that he could handle dark material in LOTR and who actually cared about the source material and on making a good film. I hope nothing like this ever happens again, and only one thing can be learnt from this: an attempt to make films in the success of other films never works.Conclusion: This movie, overall, is fine for you to take your children to watch to, but be forewarned: do not take a toilet break. You will miss some things if you are not a fan of HDM. Also, it's good for entertainment, but there I go. As with the movie, it certainly gave me a longing to see the next film, and I hope it'll be better than this one!",The Golden Compass
328,shiva333,So-So Fantasy Movie...Wretched Adaptation!,3,13 December 2007,Me and my son hurriedly finished reading The Golden Compass just before the movie came out. Both of us thoroughly enjoyed the book and are currently engrossed in the second one. Both of us were equally unimpressed and disappointed in the movie...what were they thinking? The film has virtually none of the depth of story and characters that the film has....the movie strings together all the action sequences of the book (in different order!) and gives the tiniest bit of exposition on the plot in between. The sad part is that all of the best missing bits would have required very little extra effort and no special effects...just fleshing out the characters and stories more would have made it much more satisfying. The movie was roughly 1-3/4 hour and could have easily been 2-1/2 hours or more.The first 5 or 6 chapters of the book are condensed into the first 15 minutes. And the last chapters are left out entirely!! Yes you heard me...the climactic FINAL scene of the book is completely missing! My advice is that if you have not read the book then you may enjoy the movie..it's beautifully done on the surface...there's some decent acting etc....but if you have read and loved the book you will be very let down at the lack of depth in both story and character development....it's hard to believe Pullman allowed his name to be on the credits of this turkey...,The Golden Compass
329,rklok,Confusing and disappointing,6,31 March 2008,"I went into this movie with medium to low expectations. Still I was very disappointed and utterly baffled when the end-credits appeared.Disappointed mainly because another monster-budget fantasy film with fantastic CGI had turned out to be eye-candy with no substance.Baffled because I really did not know what it was all about in the end. The film just ended without having explained anything. Most notably: What where that dust they talked about all the time? Why did she try to separate the kids from their ""demon""? Where did the witches come from to the final battle, and why? Who were they really? And on and on. I have more questions than answers after the movie, but it doesn't really matter that much, because the movie never gave me enough information about any of the story to make me curious about it.I have not read the trilogy the movie (and possible sequel(s)) is based on, and after seeing that many in here are fans of the books, I may check them out. But in itself the movies story was just confusing and appeared to me as more of a shallow, simple children's story with colourful characters, talking animals and unrealistic children-heroes with no substance or debt to it. More as an excuse to put in some interesting CGI-characters than anything else.I am a huge fan of fantasy. It has always been a dream that LOTR, and other fantasy-worlds could be made into movies. Now we can, with the huge advancements in CGI over the last years. We got LOTR, and it was very well done, even if it can never duplicate the delight of Tolkiens books. I reckon no movie can truly describe any of the great universes authors like Tolkien, Jordan, Feist, Goodkind or Pratchett have created, as well as they do in the books. Movies will never be able to replace books in that way.But still. If they are to use millions of dollars making fantasy-movies, why are they making them into stupid, mind-numbing stories only kids between 6 and 14 care about? (with the honorable exception of LOTR) TGC has got absolutely fantastic CGI. The cast is great. Especially the young girl in the leading role. Therefore I give it a 6, even though I'm so disappointed of yet another failed fantasy-movie that I really should have given it a 1.",The Golden Compass
330,Mibanilla,Surprisingly good,8,22 January 2010,"I'd never read the books, but the film was very entertaining. The world seemed similar as in Potter films, but refreshing comparing to other fantasy films. Not too 3D or too computer like. Although I think one of the air pictures were taken from France, Paris. It was like the way to Trocadero from the Eiffel tower point of view. Of Course manipulated by computer. I loved the dusty and foggy look. And how it managed to look old like in some Japanese mangaserie movies. Story was exciting and adventurous. It kept me sitting and watching the whole movie at once. And thought the main focus was probably for younger viewers I enjoined it. Well, they could have shown little bit more Daniel Greg than they did, but I guess I just have to stare The Quantum of solace next. Nicole Kidman reminded me of Marilyn Monroe in her all so golden looks and blue eyes. I wondered if she had contact lenses to make them seem so opal and turquoise.

It entangles you right in. visual effects are glamorous and they clearly indicate the movie is a well studied and high-cost one. Chacters are successfully casted not to mention Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig(nonetheless it was a little sad to see Nicole Kidman as some sort of a villianess-- she pulled it off too) The scenes and locations are well-picked/created, which allows the fantastic world to be credible and absorbing. It's so frustrating there's no sequel to fulfill the plot.Because the theme and the plot are gold mines. I could watch 5-6 more movies of this one...",The Golden Compass
332,Kaleidoscope,Wretched,2,18 June 2008,"As an atheist fan of science fiction and fantasy who has not read the books but would really like to, let me say that I found this film to be abysmal. My girlfriend (a religious person who loved the books) and I watched the first half-hour before we started skipping through scenes to see the fighting bears and the witches. Simply wretched.The basic ideas are fascinating. They are, however, laid out in broad strokes, based around a wholly unlikeable main character (at least in the first half-hour, anyway) and some of the most hamstrung, lazy, poorly written dialogue I've ever had the displeasure to hear. Complex ideas like freedom of choice and the question of the necessity or legitimacy of authority are boiled down into idiotic and awkward monologues. I realize the film is directed at children, but nearly any child with half an education could come up with something more complex.Good actors like Daniel Craig are wasted on the stupid script; I can't stand Nicole Kidman, but of the big names, she does the best job with what she's got. Ian McKellan, usually phenomenal, is phoning it in. Sam Elliott was, in the brief instances that I watched a scene long enough to see him in it, simply amazing, delivering a performance that was surprisingly great in drivel like this. The talented Eva Green was apparently also in the movie, though all she seems to do is make faces, so the role could've been played by anyone.The special effects are good enough. The emphasis on CGI means that most of it looks like a very well-done video game, but this is the plague of all CGI, and nothing special to The Golden Compass. What there is looks as good as one might expect--the Norse polar bears are particularly impressive.So there you have it: The acting is stilted and awkward, the writing loose, inconsistent and oversimplified, the basic premise incredibly deep and promising. It's a film that could've been great, but just doesn't deliver.",The Golden Compass
333,Scoobyjelly,LOTR meets Narnia,5,2 December 2007,"Somewhat dark filming with the usual odd names for the various characters and societies they represent. Orphaned children sent out to save the universe from evil. It's been used and leaps quickly without much buildup to the next sequence of edgy circumstances and challenges. It screams sequel from the first minute, but I think the producers will lose so much on this part two will die in the board room. The characters are dropouts from other Hollywood sets--take Sam Elliot, he played the same character we have seen in all of his westerns. The bear reminded me of Otis the town drunk from Mayberry. Lyra just walked from the set of Oliver Twist and kept playing the part--accent included. And please, fix the girl's teeth, her right front tooth is about to fall out from decay. It is not quite long enough to get a full nap in but will provide Mom enough time to rest her feet and credit card during the holiday shopping with the kids in tow.",The Golden Compass
334,scottgodfrey,The Golden Compass is a golden adaptation,10,24 December 2007,"""Northern Lights"" written by Philip Pullman is the story of a little girl in a parallel universe called Lyra Belacqua who journeys to the far North to save her best friend and other kidnapped children from terrible experiments by a mysterious organization.The adaptation is directed by Chris Weitz and the screenplay is also written by the director and the adaptation is so close to the mark it is hard to believe they managed to fit the story of the book into just under two hours. The pacing of this film is pretty good and it gives quite an in-depth introduction to the characters and story lines as does the author in the books making the characters and plot readily accessible for the second and third installments of the story, this is pretty well adapted to the screen and when you leave the cinema after the film you feel like you know the characters well enough to feel for them in their anguish and their joy.The acting in this film is superb including a star studded cast which includes; Nicole Kidman (Moulin Rouge, The Hours, Fur), Daniel Craig (Munich, Casino Royale, The Invasion), Sam Elliot (Buffalo Girls, Conagher) and Eva Green (Casino Royale) and Nicole Kidman gives possibly one of the best performances of her career delivering the icy cold persona that Mrs Coulter embodies in the books and reminding us of the nasty and cold characters she has played in the past including Suzanne Stone in To Die For and Grace Stewart in The Others. Daniel Craig is also brilliant here and although he is not in the film for the duration, the scenes in which he appears, he is always radiant and shining. Eva Green and Sam Elliot give solid performances here and are practically what I imagined Scoresbey and Serrefina Pekkalla to look like when reading the books, but they are totally outshined by total newcomer Dakota Blue Richards who is radiant as Lyra; showing the wreckless yet intelligent sides of the young heroine and also embodying the adventurous lead character. She is an amazing actress and we can expect great things in the future from this talented young individual.The effects in this film are also spell-binding and the directors of special effects should be more than proud of what they achieved in making this film. The costumes, sets and cinematography aspects of the film are also outstanding and everyone who contributed to making these amazing factors of the film should also be very proud. However the music in the film is wonderful; Alexandre Desplat composed an atmospheric, action packed, emotional soundtrack and the movie would not be the same without this great set of tunes and I feel that the soundtrack helps make the movie what it is. The ending song Lyra by Kate Bush is also a brilliant way to end the movie and I feel that this is one of Kate Bush's best.Although, there is one thing that I was annoyed at and I'm sure many faithful fans of the book will be too. The ending of the book has been moved to the beginning of the next movie providing the film proves to be a good source of profit. However after thinking about it before writing the review I decided that the film has enough great points to level out the flaws.Overall this film is possibly one of the best films this year and I feel it is one of the most faithful book adaptations I have ever seen on the big screen; great effects, great acting, great director. This film earns five stars and certainly deserves it and I certainly hope that this movie will do well so we can see two more brilliant adaptations and two more outstanding tales! 5/5 Stars",The Golden Compass
335,metatronica,"Well, that was disappointing.",4,7 December 2007,"There were two things I liked about this film: the actors and the imagery. Other than those two things, this film fell short of my already low expectations.One of my favourite aspects of the His Dark Material series is the author's storytelling. There's this grand and mysterious sense of a world(s) unraveling, the unveiling of truth. The progression of the story isn't just Lyra's journey, but a journey of discovery. This movie embodies none of those qualities. The plot is too fast and too choppy. The plot hurriedly jumps from one plot element to the next without achieving any character development and often not connecting one element with the next. I watched this movie with a friend who has never read The Golden Compass and she was thoroughly confused the entire time.This film was intended for an entirely different audience than the books. The plot and themes of the books were abridged and dumbed down until they appeared weak and hardly intelligent. It plays like a film for small children when the novels clearly were not. As much as I would love to see this series (some of my favourite books) adapted to the big screen, I don't think it was a good idea. The state of most of western societies are not prepared for Pullman's original story to be mass marketed. This story cannot be told in a censored form, it must be as accurately as possible or it completely loses grandeur.",The Golden Compass
336,tehoken,Hmmmm,2,7 December 2007,"now, before I start I would just like to say, Overall this film was Alright, especially the EXCELLENT performance by young Lyra, who really was the best thing about this movie, sadly after that it all went a bit downhill, the story had been edited, not to the extreme measure that some of the later Potter films have been cut, but it was still...streamlined, and I'm not 100% sure why the messed with the time-line. And not to the crux of the matter.what.the.HELL was that RETARDED, STICHED ON, Hollywood PIECE OF CR*P ENDING ALL ABOUT! seriously why ruin an otherwise fine movie with an overly sentimental piece of rubbish like that? seriously what was wrong with the ending in the book? I'll tell you what, ABS0-FREAKING-LUTLY NOTHING it was a GREAT ending that left me clawing at the walls waiting for the next book, and would have guaranteed people queueing up down the street to book tickets for the 2nd film. Sadly that ending never came to be *DESPITE CLIPS OF IT BEING IN THE TRAILER!!* so I can only hope that in my hurry to leave the cinema I missed an important scene added after the credits rolled, or, given the money grubbing corporate wh**e's at Newline, they'll release a 'special extended' DVD version with a decent ending. Otherwise for Christmas this year people will be getting there houses burned down....So please, to save me becoming a multiple felon, PLEASE do not ruin one of the greatest series of all time and FIX THAT STUPID ENDING",The Golden Compass

338,filmvisuality,Disappointing - How Roger Ebert got it all wrong!,4,30 December 2007,"Shallow. Disappointing.Not the kind of terms you would have expected from the film that critics labelled ""a darker, deeper fantasy epic than the ""Rings"" trilogy, ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" or the ""Potter"" films"". Thank you Roger Ebert for that quote.What the hell was he thinking? Ebert is basically the most well known critic in America, maybe even the world for that matter. He gave it 4 stars, the highest rating he ever gives, whilst ""The Shawshank Redemption"", the film placed at #2 on IMDb's top 250, wallows with 3 1/2 stars.Come on. Pull your thumb out.This film was essentially rushed and shallow. I myself haven't even read the books and I can identify that painstakingly clear fact. Everything didn't all make sense - the dust? the parallel world? Don't worry, that's not a spoiler, that's the opening dialogue! The characters were badly drawn out, some not even at all, actually most not at all. The film seemed to be more of a fantasy than the subject matter! The structure was bad, the narrative was completely rushed and the journey seemed as if someone had been skipping the scenes like on a DVD. It all went way too quickly.And then comes the Catholic issue. It's obvious why they are upset but seriously - the film doesn't depict the modern day Vatican, it depicts the Catholic Church that believed the Earth was flat, the one that jailed scientists for defying them. Any normal person can differentiate the both.The positive side however, is the cinematography. Top notch effort. Landscapes were magnificent. If you enjoy all the cinematography in films - put this one on mute.The casting was well done - Dakota Blue Richards is cute, and surprisingly less annoying than most kids in film! Daniel Craig and Eva Green are themselves, Nicole Kidman is OK, gets annoying at some points, Ian McKellen is very good as the polar bear and my favourite of the film - Sam Elliott.I don't want to be scathing - and both my younger sister and little cousin loved it - so I'm giving it 5.visuality.",The Golden Compass
339,paper-revolution,Surprisingly satisfying - but the book's still better.,9,19 December 2007,"Okay, I am a HUGE fan of the book, and I have to say that the movie was surprisingly satisfying. Initially, before going to see the movie, I've read from all around that the movie was rather disappointing. Not expecting that much, I went to the theaters, hoping to not be too disappointed. To my surprise, the movie was relatively faithful to the book, and I found myself rather entertained.The movie follows the story of the book. However, given the 2 hour time span, you find the characters explaining a lot of the situations, and the situations themselves being a bit rushed. The pacing, actually, was a bit off, as while there were rushed parts, there were some dragging parts as well.However, due to the magic of Pullman's original story, and the wonderful SFX team, I found that I was still somewhat mesmerized by the film. Daniel Craig and Nicole Kidman in my opinion were perfect casts for Lord Asriel and Mrs. Coulter. Dakota Blue Richards, though not what I really imagined Lyra to be, did an okay job portraying the characters.Anyway, to sum it up, though it's not as good as ""The Lord of the Rings"" series, it's still better than the ""Harry Potter"" branch. Just based on the movie, I would give it a 7, but as I'm a fan of the book, I'm giving it a 9.(Oh, also, when I was at the theater, a lot of people got annoyed at the end of the movie, assuming that it was the end of the story. It must be noted that this movie is the first part of a Trilogy- there's more to come. Apparently, a lot of people weren't aware of that.)",The Golden Compass
340,BobaFettFunnaGetYou,"For me, exactly what it promised.",10,7 December 2007,"The Golden Compass was a book I stumbled upon over this last summer. After finishing the audiobook, I realized I had discovered a new great series. I DIDN'T realize that I was underselling it to myself at that point. This movie was a delight to see in theaters. It fulfilled its promises to me. Of course, as a film it isn't nearly as perfect as it is in the printed word, but my expectations for the movie were also undersold. I found myself highly entertained as I followed the story as portrayed by a great cast of actors and voices. It just plain rocked out loud for me. Thankfully, it was far truer to the story than something like Eragon. I found very little reason to disagree with the scripting. OH, except for the ending, but I don't want to go into that because of the spoiler policy. Aw...what the heck. Story leaves off quite unexpectedly, especially since MANY trailers depict Asriel looking up at the sky after ending Rodger's life and opening a portal to the new world. Actually, more of that sequence is shown than just the after-effects... As long as The Subtle Knife is just around the corner, I can live with that. Oh yeah, and Ragnar's bottom jaw goes flying and he dies. Now THAT's true to the storyline.",The Golden Compass
341,boyalien,"Not as bad as many feared, but in need of some focus",9,30 January 2008,"I've noticed that some commentators have made a point that this film is too hard to comprehend. That is assuming a lack of intelligence on the part of the movie viewer.The Golden Compass is *not* a new ""Lord of the Rings"" (at slightly under 2 hours, how could it be?) but as far as fantasy epics go, it enters the field under divine inspiration, managing to capture the more interesting elements of the major source of myth-making of our world, and turning out a reasonable effort that suits the genre - that of (key word here): fantasy.One thing that the film does very well is criticise religion - not fatally, mind you, and nowhere to the extent that film usually reserves for science or politics. I realise that the religion-oriented symbolism was a major thematic point of the books upon which this film was based (I haven't read the stories in full, as yet), however it is rather refreshing and timely to see a film that portrays mad-religionists in a somewhat cautionary sense, that of ""religious idealism being allowed to be taken too far"" (in the control-stakes sense) rather than the usual ho-hum Hollywood tale of science-goes-too-far. (Why is it that film usually treats practitioners of science as automatically either bumbling idiots or despots who have no ethics, and who use their appreciation of finiteness to destroy everything; yet religion, the old institution which has started loads of wars, killed many, many, many people - Spanish Inquisition, for example - is off-limits.)I understand that the material was understated to appease certain rather sensitive religious conservative elements, but on the whole that only seems to intensify the ethical tale being presented. After all, to be afraid of a science-fiction story like this would only add credibility to the case that those who fear it are operating on a very, very shaky foundation to begin with, and such an underpinning only begs being unravelled.The performances in this film are a challenge to other actors to pick up their game, and the graphics and visuals complement the performances stunningly. However the film is notably imperfect. For example, it begs too much of the viewer in the opening third - we are asked implicitly to just ""go with it"", in order to make sense of what is to come - and despite this promise being repaid, it is hard on the novice. The story arc is confusing, it draws to its conclusions too quickly at the end, leaving a gaping hole for the obvious sequel (we know there are 3 books) and this gives the end of the film a schmaltzy feel.Despite my reservations, I give The Golden Compass 9 out of 10. The reason it fails on the final point is because even though we are treated to having children as protagonists (where the adults of their world, like in ours, have become staid and strait-laced and dull and too political and face-saving, typical non-individuals), even though the material takes dogma and presents it as evil, even though Kidman is stunningly evil as a nun pursuing that dogma, to the cost of young lives (doesn't anyone remember school with nuns as educators? They can be frightening - but I don't think they were ever as hot as Kidman...), even though the graphics and visuals put most of its contemporary fare in the toilet; despite these gratuitous gifts I fail it on the last point for two reasons: firstly, it didn't present its case clearly enough. There was plenty more room to move with the religious dogma and in particular, the opening half hour could have been edited a bit better instead of taking us through too many ""almost-complete"" sequences - editing which might have made the case clearer. And secondly, although perhaps it was done in order to help viewers achieve closure, cutting back that final sequence from the book (which contains the whole *point of the first story* as some have noted) - now *that* was diabolical. The film is novel in so many other ways that I fail to understand why closure is either necessary or desirable. And considering the slopping editing at the beginning - one might conclude that we were subjected to another sloppy edit at the end.",The Golden Compass
342,hubyduby,A great example of hyperactive storytelling,4,8 December 2007,"I've been reading this wonderful book by George R.R. Martin called A Game of Thrones. It is an exciting tale of fantasy fiction that rivals Tolkien's novels in depth and action. So much happens in this book that it it can become a bit of a challenge to sum up the book to someone making an inquiry. At first I start off with some basic details about the book and then when I get to the characters, I find there's a lot of intriguing information that I want to share but I don't want to get caught up too much so I start to speak faster. Then I mention the royal families and the wars and by the time I finish talking about this book, I'm out of breath and the listener is either scratching his head or nodding his head politely so as to not tell me that I did a horrible job.Unfortunately, I was scratching my head at the end of The Golden Compass. The movie makes incredible leaps and bounds over stories that deserved fifteen to thirty minutes of storytelling but was summed up in five. Apparently the story gets in the way of all the bloodless violence the movie seemed quite eager to display. The action sequences are exhilarating. However, as hectic and chaotic as they appear on screen, these scenes are actually slower than the pace of the actual storytelling. Characters and names get thrown at you. As a viewer, you are dumped in this magical world that appears interesting. Everyone has a magical pet that is tied to their soul called a daemon. They are a curious creatures that take the form of any animal. The movie slowly introduces details about these creatures throughout the movie. However, everything else gets the Cliff Notes version so that by the end, you're no longer emotionally invested in this world and are just hoping for another action sequence to slow the information overload.This movie will do well and I do recommend watching it for some great action sequences and an interesting tale. This movie would benefit from an extended play time from under 2 hours to anything over 2 and a half hours. There will be sequels. Hopefully they will take the time to actually tell a story next time instead of bedazzling us with special effects.",The Golden Compass
343,pratyushkhatiwada,An Incomplete Movie,5,7 June 2020,"I have read the book and I found the movie to be okay. Of course, they had to change a few things to get it onto the big screen, but I think there were a few parts of the film where they could have made it more accurate to Philip Pullman's amazing novel. But the main disappointment with this movie is that it doesn't feel like a complete, satisfactory movie. In my opinion, the ending is garbage. That's what brings the whole movie down.
Still, it was a 'meh' film. An ok 5 out of 10",The Golden Compass

But it's the spot-on casting that sells it for me. Lovely to see promising child actors. Also a lot of the special effects still hold up; Iorek Byrnison's fight with Iofur Racknison is still epic. A good watch for those not too bothered by the medium adaption changes",The Golden Compass
345,qmediacom,Chris Weiz  C-minus; Studio  F,1,9 December 2007,"Chris Weiz  C-minus; Studio  F Time will tell of the fate of Golden Compass. Time will tell if Chris Weiz's career can recover. Time will tell which New Line Executives will get the boot  and many will, the likes one hasn't seen in Hollywood in years  or, more seriously, if the studio has the finances to sustain and repay the debt incurred to make the film. Golden Compass could very well go down in history as the ""Heaven's Gate"" of the new millennia.Heaven's Gate, you may recall, was a late-70s revisionist Western that bankrupted United Artists. At the time, it was the most expensive film made ($45 million dollars in production costs; another $30 million in advertising). The film, now considered a masterpiece, running 4 hours (with intermission), unfurled and improvised at its own, deliberate pace, telling a story about a significant, though little-understood episode in American history. Its length limited its ability to make its money back for its investors (2 showings per day). It was universally condemned by critics with such vehemence not read since Bosley Crowther's scathing comments about Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch. The studio, or director, depending on whom you believe, pulled the film from distribution. Within months, overwhelmed by crushing debt, all of its executive fired, had to sell the assets of the company to stay afloat, ending up as a week subsidiary of MGM. Now, almost 30 years later, history could repeat itself. New Line Cinema, in their infinite wisdom, put their faith and money ($165 million dollars, not counting advertising) into a first-time-fantasy-film director by the name of Chris Weiz. The budget of this single film totaled 2/3s of the entire Rings trilogy. No wonder he quit the production at one point (only to be lured back). He may have earned points with the executives, but he didn't do his career any favors. New Line will have to do something to recoup this money. I predict you will see a theatrical re-issue of the extended-director cuts of the Lord of the Rings next summer, perhaps sooner. The company will have to get cash flow somehow  because it is not going to happen with Golden Compass  and what better way than to raid your archives.All this is rather unfortunate, because no one wanted to see this film succeed more than I. As a great fan of the books  I've read the trilogy twice  the themes are extraordinary and complex, diving into areas hardly even addressed in adult literature. Written and published around the same time as Potter, they never quite took off into the stratosphere in the same way, but they were duly recognized by others as tackling compelling issues in equally compelling ways. Yes, the books have several interesting, but not debilitating, flaws  what book wouldn't that tries to tackle situations both deeply mystical and, at the same time, deeply familial. So, how do you make a film about God, about growing up, about death, about fantasy and imagination, about mother and father or the lack thereof, about the severing of the literal manifestation of your consciousness (metaphorically, free will) from your person?Well, you don't do it like the film that is in your theaters today.You do it by being brave  as brave as your subject matter  and not jettison plot elements just because they make you uncomfortable. The audience is smarter than you think!You don't do it by editing the film in such a way that you are blitzkrieging through the film faster than Gen. Patton on his way to Germany. You don't do it in a way that subverts the drama of the story because you are afraid of a ""downer"" anything. If that is the case, why bother making the film  this film  at all. Come on, folks!You do it in a way that offers an intelligent script that doesn't pander or talk down to the audiencethat can offer motivation without explanation, reasoning without coincidence, emotion without manipulation.When you really think about it, this film is less science-fantasy than you might imagine. It is about family and relationships, the elemental forces of nature, and absolute power, not about fighting bears, flying witches, or sailing 'gyptians  though they are PART of the story, they are not THE story.A studio executive from way back once said: ""If the scene is about the scene, then you are in deep s***!""",The Golden Compass
346,john-4316,Impressive Special Effects Entertaining Movie,10,10 December 2007,"I did not read the book and do not know anything about Pullman. But I did enjoy the movie The Golden Compass immensely. The special effects are simply the best I have ever seen, they are absolutely amazing and worth the price of admission. For those who complain that it was not realistic, I have to agree. Of course it isn't it's a fantasy, a place located in a parallel universe to ours where animals ""Demons"" speak perfect English.The actors did a great job and pulled me into the original story and made it believable. The action occurs at a good pace so the story flows smoothly.As I was looking through the IMDb site on The Golden Compass, I could not believe how anyone could think this movie is a threat to religious belief. This movie is a fantasy. It does not take place on this world so how can it be against any organized religion? This is a family movie and my kids thoroughly enjoyed the movie as well. So suspend your belief in reality for 113 minutes and enjoy the story.",The Golden Compass
347,Shilshadu,"As Good as it Gets, Despite imperfections.",10,27 November 2007,"It is obvious from the very beginning that New Line interfered with the overall formula of the story. The book/movie puzzle is nearly complete, but a few pieces are still missing... And NO, it does NOT promote atheism, for the LAST time!First off, it opens up in our world, with Eva Green giving a brief description of Dust and other worlds. It's useful, especially for non-fans. Then transitions into Lyra's Oxford. The beginning has some of the most memorable scenes, if not best scenes, of the film. My reasoning is not because of action, but of the pure heart of it. Sure, it strays some from the book, but book/movie translations have never been perfect, just ask a potter fan. The first hour is basic character development, and wraps you completely into the world of Lyra's Oxford. The movie does this effectively, and the daemons are so full of life it's like their real! Don't get me wrong, the A-list actors are great, despite short screen time, but the daemons steal the show. Not just the daemons, but the animals as well. Iorek, for example, is one of the most proud, strong characters i've ever seen. It fits the book's vision of him perfectly, if not better. Now, more to the plot of the film, Lyra leaves for the North with the beautifully malevolent Mrs. Coulter after Roger disappears, and escapes after finding her to be the leader of the Gobblers. Yes, Gobblers, in the trailer Lyra said 'magisterium', rest assured, it's gobblers in the film. also, it's 'alethiometer' in the film. You fans can let the weight off your shoulders. After leaving Mrs. Coulter, she is attacked, then saved by the gyptians. She pleads with them to go north, to save the kids at bolvangar, and winds up on the boat, all within a short screen time. It seemed fast-paced, but not so much as to seem rushed. In the book, it was fast-paced as well, and it was properly transitioned. When she finally reaches the north, she hires the panserbjorne, or armoured bear, Iorek Byrnison, in some of the most visually satisfying scenes of the film. As I said, Iorek was crafted wonderfully, and the voice actor did an excellent job of capturing his power. In the next half hour, Lyra's at bolvangar, after crossing the bridge, they have the battle there, save the kids, yadda yadda. soon she's with Iorek, after tricking Ragnar, not Iofur, and the two bears fight in another visually satisfying scene. The movie soon ends with her and roger being reunited in an emotional finale. Yes, the last three chapters were cut out, but it didn't take away from the movie. The good news is that we'll see those cut scenes in the Subtle Knife, because its confirmed they've started filming. Because they've invested so much, they can't possibly not do a follow up. The Good: Satisfying, visually, mentally, metaphysically (whatever that means) follows the book pretty well. Actors are great, world is full of life. Lyra's the heart of most scenes. Overreacting religious groups will have nothing too complain about with this movie. it's relatively clean. Guess they'll have to boycott I Am Legend instead, for it's post-apocalyptic views....The Bad: Does seem a bit rushed at points, could've slowed down during the fast paced latter half of the movie. Magisterium wasn't dark enough. A few backgrounds feel generic. Obviously, some beloved scenes in the book didn't make the final cut, who knew??? Overall: the best fantasy film making around, it looks like New Line has another hit on its shoulders. Definitely worth a watch.",The Golden Compass

The bears, Daemons, machines, and other fantastical elements are all very well done.However, a pretty movie does not a good movie make. The plot was rather lacking and the narrative not terribly compelling.

349,lostdreamer,Extremely disappointed (small spoiler),4,7 December 2007,"I was extremely excited to see this film as I've read all three books and really liked them. So, with much ado, i made my way into the theatre to watch this movie.I know movies can't be like the books and with the length of the movie I knew a lot would change. However, this isn't my issue, entirely.I found the movie choppy and put together all wrong. One thing would jump to another without any real explanation. I brought my fiancé to the movie, who never read the books. He expressed confusion throughout the movie and said that for the majority of the movie he was bored.The special affects are great. I liked the daemon's (except the golden monkey). I just felt that this movie was one big disaster and am extremely disappointed.One problem I had was that they made Lord Asriel likable. He's not a likable character and he is very self-centered. The books are very dark and the descriptions so vivid and this didn't make it into the movie.The ending: Well.....umm...yeah...it just ended. There was no conclusion to the movie, just some cheesy dialogue.The only bright part was the girl playing Lyra. She's a wonderful choice to play this character.My recommendation is to see this movie, but don't expect too much from it. It's a wonderful fluff piece.",The Golden Compass
350,jwebbjr,Book is much better; how does your shoe fit?,7,16 December 2007,"First, I am a Southern Baptist. The called for boycott is probably responsible for greater than half of the box office gross so far--at least in the US. As far as the books, I've read them--just because someone is an atheist doesn't mean that they're wrong about organized religion.I saw the movie today and I'm not sure what the fuss is about. I wouldn't consider this a spoiler, but some may, so beware.As I see it, the basic premise of the books is about oligarchical control and freewill. It may be allegorical or not. We have the magisterium that is an organization about control. It is ruthless in its methods. Now, that is not unlike the Catholic church (or other religious bodies) through the ages.From my perspective, though, those who say it is an attack on organized religion, probably have a case of a well fitting shoe. It's more of an attack on ruthless autocratic fascist organizations than that. You could just as well say that it's about Nazi's or Communists. So please, get over the anti-religion hype.All of that notwithstanding, I would recommend reading the book. If you're a Christian lambasting this movie without reading it, you're just trusting what your leaders have told you. They wouldn't lie to you--I'm sure they can adequately critique it for you.The movie suffers from a few flaws in its screenplay adaptation and execution. The soundtrack is mediocre. In my opinion, for some scenes, it often evoked the exact opposite emotions than intended in the book. But that might be congruous given that several pivotal scenes in the screenplay suffered the same trouble. We'll see what I think on second watching, or after some reflection.",The Golden Compass

The screenplay is complex enough to make it a thriller - only the ending is a bit up in the air, perhaps leaving room for a sequel. Well, just take in the excellent acting and revel in this feast for the eyes: the shiny mechanisms and old-fashioned machines lumbering along and floating in the air, and the great colors!

352,nescient,You won't need an alethiometer to tell you how bad it is,3,6 February 2008,"Having read the books I was looking forward to this film  if only to see how such a complex and intriguing children's story (yes, publishing hype aside, it is a children's story), would be handled by those without an imagination of their own.I am disappointed but not at all surprised.The Golden Compass is awful.*** I'll offer my comments in a (hopefully) organised fashion; 1) Special Effects (CGI to most people  though of course it's more than that) I've mentioned this first because CGI is a pre-requisite for modern fantasy movies, and, sadly, too often the barometer of a movie's worth. Okay - personal daemons, armoured bears, flying witches and Zeppelins can't be realised without it - and it's all very well done, as one would expect in a day and age in which there's a pseudo-Cray in every household.2) Art Direction Art-deco, art-nouveau, whatever it is - sets, costumes, lighting - I loved it. In the book Lyra's world is tantalisingly like the one we know - and yet so different  and for me that was the magic. So, except for the OTT skylines (and the Master's manservant, Hunt, who looked like a mannequin from Moss Bros), they got it about right for me.But, as Confucius might have said; ""Film punter not live on art direction alone."" So on we go...3) Script & Direction The books are nebulous enough, and this movie does nothing to help. I found the first half-hour utterly confusing  and I already know the story. It seemed thrown together by film students. Examples; 'The Gobblers' insidious activity (a principal thread in the book) is introduced clumsily, and almost as an after-thought.The daemons (surely Pullman's most original and endearing creation) come across as nothing but cute pets (sic). (If you've read the book you'll understand the irony.) The supposedly all-powerful and authoritarian 'Magisterium' (the book's thinly-veiled Church, and hub of the antagonism) has all the menace of a Darby-and-Joan club outing to Brighton. Dear oh dear.By the way, I read the books only recently  to see what all the fuss was about. I found TNL absolutely intriguing, TSK very 'Janet and John - Book One', and TAS - well, an uphill struggle. (The gradient was not intellectual, but rather that the story had become contrived and drawn out to the point where I found it difficult to maintain interest.) That said, the overall story is fascinating, especially in the way it slowly develops the importance of the bond between human and daemon, the concept of parallel worlds, and the political machinations of the Magisterium. In TGC there is none of this. Asriel declares the existence of parallel worlds in the first few minutes, AND that he's going to try to travel to one of them! What the! The director has simply dumped the whole concept on the table, and said, ""There. This is what's going on, okay? Right, let's get on with the action."" Terrible.As for the staggeringly flat ending - does the director have ANY idea about storytelling?4) Acting & Direction I've left acting till last because it's here that Compass falls flat on its very expensive face. The adults aside (though Tom Courtenay was embarrassingly flat), the acting is appalling. I don't mean a bit iffy. I don't mean bad. I mean APPALLING. I have, no word of a lie, seen more pathos in infant school nativity plays.Dakota Richards is wooden throughout, to the point where I breathed a sigh of relief whenever she WASN'T in a scene. I ask you, what the hell happened to the tearaway, roof-hopping, lying, mud-slinging tomboy of the novels? I found Lyra's duplicitous character a joy to read  and it made me root for her; but the movie Lyra, Goldilocks hair and all, is a far cry from the rapscallion of the book. And the other child actors fare no better  being devoid of emotion, intonation, and any semblance of 'presence'.And the dialect! Argh! Lyra's accent in the book tagged her immediately as a street urchin. In the movie, however, this dialect is delivered so badly that I shuddered every time I heard the word 'ent' (and I'm not even from Oxford, or anywhere near). Okay, I know the director is American, but Dakota Richards is English (and from the South, to boot), and they surely had resources to draw upon  not least the author. So how on earth did they contrive to get the dialogue sooooooo wrong? Now, I'm not shooting the messengers here  the producers are to blame for casting kids who were simply not up to it; and the director is to blame for not reading the novel before making the film. Events in the book that are fuelled by emotion are rendered in the film with the timidity of a game of tiddlywinks, and that's a travesty.5) Conclusion I give The Golden Compass 3/10  because; c) it was a change to see an 'interesting' children's book screened, after years of Harry Potter tedium.b) of the daemons (for what they were) - changing form, dying etc.a) Iorek Byrnisson's and Lee Scoresby's characterisations breathed some life into an otherwise very dull affair.Flat, I think I called it? Yes. As a millpond. *** To close, I heard that TGC was up for Best Art Direction? Well, I hope it wins in THIS category alone  if only to emphasise how badly every other department fared.Mick (UK).PS I read on IMDb that PP was asked his opinion of the short-listed Lyras, and preferred Dakota Richards. Like I said - the producers are to blame. ;o)",The Golden Compass
353,mbiajc,The blame starts with Chris Weitz and goes north.,2,12 December 2007,"The opening scene was the very first clue that this film was going to be the barrage of formula drudgery that it ultimately turned out to be. Weitz began by unveiling all the information which the reader isn't even aware of by the end of the first novel in a horrific attempt to follow the footsteps of The Lord of the Rings with an opening prelude. Much of the intrigue of Pullman's storytelling is derived from the careful progression of revealed information, letting the reader know only as much as it needs to at any moment, and no more. The mystery is not only lost, it is purposely banished by the blundering slate of exposition which begins with the prologue and carrys on through the film's duration. Every bit of exposition has the feel of a technical bother that must be gotten out of the way so that the action scenes can make some kind of sense. But the real kicker is the obviousness. The obviousness ranging from New Line's less than subtle attempt to repeat a miracle (LOTR), to the individual lines in the film (""Why am I here? What do they want? What is she going to do with me?""), and everything in between. Show, don't tell, is the first rule of third grade story writing, a class these film makers clearly missed. The film makers (Chris Weitz and everyone above him) have absolutely no respect for their audience. Somehow they expect people to go to a film like TGC for the action sequences and great CG. They expect people can't make inferences and connect the dots unless it is entirely spelled out for them. And the really amazing thing, is that in spite of spilling every possible secret of the narrative before the audience could possibly start to wonder about it, the tangle of facts are hugely more confusing than the novel. This is a fumble truly. It was too big of a project for Weitz and there was way too much (it would seem) direction from above the director making this superb story of amazingly real characters in an amazing, whimsical world nothing more than a long string of pretty CG which amounts to a fantastically muddled flop. I really have to say that the first mistake made was the same one made by Walden Media with the Chronicles on Narnia: making a children's film out of something that wasn't child-material. His Dark Materials are not for children, Narnia wasn't either. They fit into a genre of literature clearly not understood by Newline, Walden, and film studios like them: Novels. Just because the main characters are children people readily assume they are children's stories, but Pullman's work, more so even than Narnia, is written with an intelligent, imaginative, but somewhat cynical audience in mind. Sure their isn't graphic sex and foul swearing, but the themes addressed in his books are not of a pre-teen nature in the least. The main character in the Sixth Sense is a pre-teen, but no one would assume the bulk of the audience would be ten year olds. Somehow in the fantasy realm, studios have seen giant dollar signs over the heads of young children and grasped for material with a previously established audience that appeals to this demographic. What they forgot about Lord of the Rings is that it was directed by a genius, a genius who cared about both the source material and making as good a film as possible, someone who actually understood the language of film, something that cannot be said for Weitz or anyone above him responsible for this film. Jackson was a dark film maker, his previous films Brain Dead, Heavenly Creatures, and The Frighteners preparing him to deal very appropriately with the material of the Lord of the Rings. Material which, while far denser than Narnia or Compass material, was no more deserving of a serious handling and of caring, talented hands.The question I have to ask is do the people responsible realize what they have done wrong, and if they do, do they care? My guess is they will begin to care when TGC loses money and perhaps they will begin to understand that audiences don't want a bunch of CG action sequences or pretty costumes. Audiences, for every genre and category, want a good story well told with characters that they care about and mystery they can feel. Maybe the next time they spend 180 million dollars they will ponder this, and maybe then we will see something worthwhile. Until then, we can expect nothing more than a steady stream of Narnia-Compass-Eregon-Etc. drivle from the studio machine.",The Golden Compass
354,piece_of_heavn,"Not the worst, but a Frankenstein adaptation",2,9 July 2008,"I read a commentary on this movie some months ago, which said this was the worst movie ever seen. Well now I've watched it, and I can say its not the worst movie, but it is the worst adaptation I've ever seen. I can't believe Phillip Pullman agreed to this screenplay. Everything's been changed, rearranged, pulled and relocated into places it doesn't belong. The storyline gives too much information away that was only revealed in the final book, and the screenplay suffers for it. The girl comes to deductions that shouldn't even be possible with the information she has.Aside from all the idiocy of the screenplay itself, the CGI is worthy of Pullman's alter-world. The bears, and daemons are done well. The acting is well, as Nicole Kidman, Sam Elliott, Dakota Blue Richards, and the others all give it there best, even with the limited capabilities of the script.If you plan to see this movie, do so before you read the books. If you've already read the books, don't watch the movie, its a bad letdown. Its not worthy as an adaptation; its not even worthy as a stand-alone project.

355,SnaggleSnark,A pleasant but flawed film which is barely a pale copy of the book,6,4 January 2008,"This film is a classic example of book to film problems.If you have not read the book, it could be seen as quite an enjoyable children's film - beautiful to look at, well cast and acted. The action simply follows the main character of Lyra - which is just as well, since the plot would be confused and confusing without knowledge of the book.However, if the film is judged as a version of the book, although it starts to make sense, the problems multiply. The background to nearly everything in the book was missing, or wrongly portrayed - for example, at one point Mrs Coulter slaps her own daemon.Why? It is the same as slapping yourself, not something the self-serving Mrs Coulter would be likely to do. All the sinister and scary elements were ironed out of the film. It felt as though the plot was really rushed through, to fit everything in, and yet it never really seemed to get anything important in.There is much to like in this film, it is a pleasant watch, but if you are looking for Northern Lights, it isn't here.",The Golden Compass
356,NirvanaNaslund,"Had Potential, but Suffered Severely from Poor Pacing",5,16 December 2007,"Philip Pullman's popular tale of fantasy finally makes its way onto the big screen in The Golden Compass. Director Chris Weitz steps outside his comedic norm, and also, for the first time, directs a film independently from his older brother, Paul. With the novel's exceeding popularity, it was not difficult to ensemble a cast of actors willing to take part in, possibly, a future classic of the fantasy genre, a la The Lord of the Rings. However, what the film does fail to do is utilize the cast.Nicole Kidman, who Philip Pullman had considered for the roll 10 years before a film adaptation was even announced, acts well walking around looking evil, but fails to add any depth to the performance. Both Eva Green and Christopher Lee do a fine job, the problem is they each have about a minute of screen time. Daniel Craig and Sam Elliott take advantage with what they were given. Newcomer, Dakota Blue Richards delivers a surprisingly strong performance as the hero of the story in a role that over ten thousand were considered for.The story, itself, is interesting and engaging. It takes place in a parallel universe where people have their souls living outside of them in a form of animals, called daemons (pronounced demons). Lyra (Dakota Blue Richards) and her daemon, Pan, hear a rumour of something called 'dust', which resides in the north, and has the power to unite the universe. However, standing in their way is something called the Magisterium (bearing more than a little resemblance to the Catholic Church), which would prefer that this not be found. Lyra finds herself caught up in all of this, as she is the only one who can read 'the golden compass' which answers all of life's questions. It is a remarkable story, which is sadly told in an unremarkable way.The whole film screams spoiled potential. It seems so intent on getting every concept and character from the book into the film, and wanting to stay under 2-hours, that it fails to develop any characters. The director introduces a character, shows him or her in two scenes, and then seems to expect an emotional attachment when the character returns for the climax, but by then, it's more of an afterthought. The sad thing is, the problem could have been solved so easily. By cutting out some unnecessary characters, or simply adding 45 minutes to the screen time. It would have given characters a chance to develop.At parts, the story is as fleshed-out as the characters, and suffers from many of the same problems. Ideas are noted in one scene, and instead of developing the idea and letting the feeling grow on the audience it jumps to the next one so quickly the viewer loses interest. At times it would slow down, and that's where the best parts were, but just when it seems like it might improve, it starts sprinting for the finish, again. The very poor pacing nearly kills the whole film.Where the film is at its most inspired is with the action. Containing awe-inspiring CGI, and some fight scenes that won't be soon forgotten. Most notably, a rip-roaring engagement between two giant armoured polar bears for supremacy in the polar bear kingdom. That scene gives the viewer hope for an exciting climax, which unfortunately, doesn't live up to that first fight.In the end, great source material and a couple of violent polar bears aren't quite enough to offset the very poor pacing and development of characters. **/4.",The Golden Compass
357,Chris_Halpin,Poor fantasy at best,2,31 December 2007,"The film starts with so much promise but fails to deliver. Some top notch actors try their hardest but the real problem lies with both the source material and the child actors. The latter sometimes make the film have that ""school play"" feel with some...(read more) awful dialogue, and the former just doesn't make for an interesting or well thought out world. The concepts behind the universe in which the film is set are simply too daft to take seriously as they overstep fantasy (and even camp fantasy) to become completely bizarre and badly thought out. Admittedly most of my criticism is levelled at the book and the universe the author has created but that obviously affects the film as a whole, with source material this poor a film should never have been attempted.",The Golden Compass

Also there were a lot of children in the cinema who were restless, and frustrated, clearly they were frightened or confused. just because it's PG and involves children doesn't mean that children will enjoy it. and if you do see it then remember to see a late session where you don't have to deal with children making noise.",The Golden Compass

The girl's powers made sense, Nicole Kidman became a caring person, her Uncle was someone important to her, and the polar bear would soon become her best friend.I was extremely disappointed at the end of the movie. At first I thought just maybe there will be a sequel...something to make this ending make sense, and a reason for us to feel unfinished and like we've been left hanging.I truly think it's worth seeing once...after that you may not want to see it again, you may feel unfinished as I did; but you will definitely feel a certain enchantment about this film either way.",The Golden Compass

I wasn't too excited beforehand but expected much more.The film itself is entertaining and will be loved by kids and adults alike, both for its story and effects. I however found it to be a flawed as a stand alone feature and not up to the hype. The action was good and the direction tolerable but the story was so badly laid out. A major character was involved in an incident half way through then never to be seen again only to be mentioned as to his new location.

361,jazz_jeff,"A Terrible, Terrible Mess Of A Film.",1,1 July 2008,"Dear lord, what a mess the makers and writers made out of this film.It started off interesting with hope then very quickly it descended into a mess of re-written scripts TOTALLY different to the book. The scenes themselves looked beautiful but everything else after that was a complete mess. Plots were left unexplained, the reasons for many, many characters existents and actions were not even explained or touched on - as well as their very actions being completely changed or invented totally from thin air! You were left wondering many a time ""why is this happening"" - ""who did that happen?"" - ""what has this got to do with the story"" - what the heck is going on?"" and ""would someone please explain why ALL of the characters are doing what they are doing? And that's just the tip of the iceberg...The makers of this film TOTALLY took a meat cleaver to the story. Cut huge and I mean HUGE chunks out, totally twisted scenes around to an unbelievable extent, let characters live that actually die, NEVER explained backgrounds of anything! Leaving out the fact that they rewrote the whole book and made a complete shambles of it, just as a non-reader, many have commented to me in the cinema, on the way out and afterward to this present day (June 2008) the equivalent of ""you could tell they pulled the good guts out of it"". Dear god, if your going to make a film from a book, stick with the book or make up one of your own completely. Don't waste our time and your own by buying the rights to a book and then ripping it to shreds and sticking it back together again in an unintelligible mess. What is the point of buying the rights to a book in the first place if your going to totally re-write it (and screw it up in the process too to boot)?I understand that the makers were spineless and cowered to the religious nuts by removing anything that made any intelligence to those with brains. The effect of this cowardice left behind a film that was a total waste of time, an insult to the original writer of the book and a waste of talent that should have been used better in a greater film than this mixed, unexplained unmitigated disaster.If there is going to be sequels and going by this film, I hope to all heavens there is NOT - can we the audience have a change of makers, scriptwriters and a producer, a director with a brain and at least someone with guts to stand up against the zealous religious right.To sum up: what a complete mess and waste of talent.This film could have been so, so so much better.Rating: one out of ten.",The Golden Compass
362,tuckerman,Sit back and enjoy,9,8 December 2007,"Sure, I've heard all the controversy about the evil Church in this movie, ad nauseum, but there were no fingers pointing at anything but a fictional church that was made up just for this movie, so both sides of the debate should just chill. It's not a religion - it's a church, an organization of people who are in power and want more, and don't worry about the doing dirty work to get it.So yes, there's an evil church that wants to control everything. There's got to be a bad guy so you can root for the good guys, and evil corporations are getting pretty old and wouldn't work for a this fantasy anyway.Okay, we know the author doesn't take kindly to the Roman Church, he's admitted that. But Catholic or not, you've got to admit, there was a time when they'd burn you alive for heresy, so good for them for mending their ways and growing up.Maybe Islamists should try to catch up, it would be about time they let go of the 14th century. Wanting to kill someone for naming a Teddy Bear, come on. If we didn't already know the author disliked the Roman church, the Islamists would recognize this fictional church as an attack on their own, and call for his head.Sit back, relax, and enjoy this beautiful ride in fantasy land. I was highly entertained, didn't have to strain my brain, though it wasn't stupid, and it didn't rely on sex, ultra-violence, four letter words, etc, etc. If I had kids, I'd be happy to take them to see this movie.",The Golden Compass
363,roy_imdb,One of the worst book adaptations in memory,3,14 December 2007,"To set the context, I read The Golden Compass with my daughters (age 9 & 12) before seeing this movie. We enjoyed the book a great deal, but have only barely started the second book in the series so far. So, we are not exactly fanatics about it. For additional context and comparison, I thought the first Narnia film adequate though far less than perfect, the Harry Potter films quite good until the fifth, which was quite disappointing. That said, this movie committed nearly all of the of the cardinal sins that a movie adaptation of a book can commit. Let's see if I can remember them all.First, there was a great deal of important, interesting, and exciting material cut from the movie. I have a hard time believing that you can view this film as anything but a straight adventure/action flick without the missing background information.Because of this, the movie hits you over the head with information like a blunt instrument. Where the book was masterful at simply laying out this alternate universe and letting you figure it out bit by bit, the movie starts with a ham handed narration to introduce the major concepts Concepts that unfold over the first 200 pages or so of the book are essentially blurted out in the first 2 minutes of the movie.The movie makes changes to the book for no apparent reason. I'm not talking about characters being eliminated or combined -- those things happened. But, why rename the king of the bears? Why change Iorek Byrnison's back story (and that of Iofur/Ragnar's as well)? These are trivial changes whose only effect is to be a jarring distraction to anybody who has read the book and is paying attention.There are also significant changes to the narrative and time line. A different character -- one that didn't exist in the book -- tries to poison Lord Asriel. The picture he shows the scholars is different. The episode with the bears is incongruously inserted before the Bolvangar climax, which was itself cut so short it could be called ""Dorf on Bolvangar."" (if you get that reference, consider yourself OLD) The whole handling of The Magisterium is laughably unsubtle. Oh, if only I had the free will to think for myself and figure out what the theme of the movie might be. Bleh.The dialog is often trite. I had to exercise all my self control not to laugh out loud when the inevitable Sam Elliot ""Reckon so"" popped up.Several characters are given extra screen time for the sole point (I assume) of giving the characters screen time. Daniel Craig's glacier fight was straight out of James Bond, and was completely pointless. It leads to his fate having to be clumsily inserted in an incredibly obvious exposition by Serafina Pekalla.Serafina, on the other hand, is inserted in place of her familiar so that the actress can get her face time. The witches as a whole are completely wasted.I might as well be presumptuous and describe what I had expected when I read the book, because I think it would have made for a better film.First, the book should have ended with the escape from Bolvangar. This would have set up a second movie for the Svalbard chapters and the first part of The Subtle Knife.I also would have allowed the film to run 15-30 minutes longer. Oh, I know this is heresy in a world where we have a Disney-standard maximum running time of 90 minutes for kids films, but I think the Harry Potter movies proved that kids will sit through a longer movie if it's a good movie. This would have allowed enough time to tell the story in full.Finally...well really, that's all you'd need to do in order to have a first-rate movie that would appeal to kids and adults. As it stands, this one is nothing more than a lost opportunity. Even my 9-year-old termed it ""Disappointing, plus more disappointment.""",The Golden Compass
364,thecrisis-1,Absolutely stupendous reflection of history and human nature,10,26 May 2008,"This was an astonishingly good film.Without getting into any comparisons with its pop-culture-ordained rival, The Chronicles of Jerusalem (I mean Narnia), I will say this is the best fantasy movie to hit the shelves since Lord of the Rings.The story is explosive, dynamic and startlingly accurate if viewed in a historical sense. Dakota Blue Richards is the most talented child actress I have ever seen and is sure to become a huge star in the next ten years. She embodies courage, fearlessness, bravery and intelligence in a way that would make Harry Potter or even Hermione Granger blush. Her character is a forceful blend of guts and intelligence to the point that several of her actions throughout the story made my jaw drop to the floor, thinking ""wow, this girl is CRAZY!"" in awe and admiration of her strength and courage.For those of you who have not seen this movie, if you want to see a child actor rival virtually every A-list blockbuster star in Hollywood, Dakota Blue Richards is your girl.I was also happy to see Daniel Craig in this film, as he was great in Casino Royale and it was interesting to see him in such a starkly different role. He was stern, adamant and intelligent to the point of lunacy - and I'm looking forward to seeing his character more in the two sequels that are sure to come, despite what the crybabies and naysayers might think.Nicole Kidman put forth her best role to-date as the terrifying Marisa Coulter - a woman so cold and conniving and yet eerily welcoming it will make your skin crawl. She is as also as beautiful as she has ever been, which never hurts either.All in all, the only real complaint with this movie is that it could have been 30-45 minutes longer, but I only say that because we've been spoiled with the 2-3 hour epic journeys on which the LOTR and Harry Potter have taken us. But on a blank slate, this was an incredible 90 minutes of my life and this movie has permanently put itself on a pedestal in the history of film making.An absolute MUST watch.",The Golden Compass

366,dridi_i,Terrible!!!,3,2 December 2007,"I watched The Golden Compass during an advanced preview of the movie. Let me tell you that this movie is plain terrible. The story: It doesn't make sens at all and there's no relation whatsoever with the title. The compass was supposed to tell the truth, but there was no single fragment of what truth...After a somewhat enjoyable first ten minutes, the story becomes like a bad swiss cheese: The plot holes keep accumulating and the story goes nowhere. That's due to the twenty, or so, subplots that stretch the story left and right leaving you confused. The film start with the compass, then there's a story about some witches, then you're taken to a bear tribe and finally all ends up in a factory-like place where they keep some children... And the bad guys keep popping everywhere all the way. Can somebody please tell me how all of that is related to the Golden Compass and the truth it was supposed to tell? The character development: Non existent. That's also due to the fact that there are more subplots than you can count. Craig has a mere 15 minutes of screen presence. Kidman about 30 minutes or so. Green about 10 minutes. The only ones that seem to enjoy more screen time are the Daemons, and it's all about showing off some cool CGI. As for the protagonist Lyra, I couldn't help but disliking her. She was supposed to be an innocent child who couldn't read the Compass, but all of a sudden, she could use it better than a pro...I won't talk about the ending because it's so amateurish that even the kids in the auditorium were laughing. The directing: You better not ask about it because there is none. The actors are left alone mumbling some lines they were told to say. All in all I give this movie a solid 3 out of 10. The story isn't interesting, the directing was horrible, and the character development is non existing.",The Golden Compass

370,craftycurate,Pretty but shallow film. Too short to do justice to a great book.,5,19 January 2008,"Hmmm.This is a good looking film. Rich and interesting costumes and locations, with some nice FX make for some nice eye candy. But underneath it, there isn't a great deal.Don't get me wrong - ""Northern Lights"" is a intricate and clever novel, but that seems to have been the movie's undoing.There is so much to explain, that the scriptwriter seems to have had time to do little else but ""exposition"" - trying to explain this philosophical framework, explain all the concepts and the parallel universe stuff, and try to explain who everybody was and why they were there, that there was little time to build characters and tell a story.The script feels very dumbed down and shallow, and reduces Pullman's rich language to a kind of rapid fire series of short statements about Dust, the Magisterium, daemons or whatever. It just doesn't work at a deeper level.Had the film gone for a more epic Lord of the Rings approach, there would have been more time to weave the story, paint fuller character portraits and draw the viewer in. As it is, it felt like a hastily put together lesson on Philip Pullman's imaginary universe, and as a result, it all feels shallow.The actors look like they're doing their job rather than entering enjoying portraying rich characters, and If I hadn't read the book, I might have given a higher score, but given how bored I was in the cinema, and how much of a wasted opportunity the whole thing seemed, it's only a 5.",The Golden Compass
371,dumitru-2,As 'difficult' as expected,8,26 December 2007,"I have read His Dark Materials trilogy many years ago. These are the most inspiring books that I have read in my life. However, seeing the Harry Potter movies (i've also read all 7 parts), I got a little worried.His Dark Materials is a very dark trilogy with a lot of ideas and taboo topics. These books are based on dialogue, and there's lots of it. The movie starts with a small introduction about the world Lyra lives in, about the daemons. That kinda prepares the audience for the ""talking animals"", which is a very tough thing to do. People can't take seriously talking animals. The action starts right away with many characters popping in and out. Nobody gets a proper introduction, nobody gets enough screen-time in order for the audience to start caring for any of them, or at least remember their names. There are like 5 story lines happening at the same time, so the image jumps to different locations every 2 minutes. Again - nobody understands a thing. To compensate for all this 'nonsense', the eye-candy is present. The bears are done exactly as they should be: big, strong, loud and scary. So if you're going with your kids (7-13 y.) - they will appreciate it. I enjoyed the movie just because I'm a huge fan of the trilogy. However, I would not go see it without reading the books first. That would be a waste.Giving a 'high' 8/10 for 2 reasons: 1. It was very hard to make a 2-hour movie based on this book. Even making a 5-hour movie wouldn't have helped much. 2. I'm a fan of His Dark Materials, so I can't give less.",The Golden Compass
372,divadrummer-1,Compass' Timeless Story Lost in Aesthetics,6,8 December 2007,"Based on the book ""Northern Lights"" (marketed as ""The Golden Compass"" in the US) by Philip Pullman, The Golden Compass features a star-studded supporting cast and newcomer Dakota Blue Richards as the crafty main character, Lyra. Pullman's books are some of my favorites, and the Golden Compass stands out in the His Dark Materials trilogy as the most whimsical and adventure-driven. The movie captures some of this tone while borrowing stylistic elements from popular fantasy movies that came before it. The story should be enough to elevate Golden Compass beyond its stunning graphics, but becomes somewhat lost in the spectacle. Golden Compass fails to make a distinguishing mark on the ever-growing list of CGI-driven fantasy for children.The movie takes place in an alternate world where peoples' souls reside outside of their bodies in animal forms called daemons. Lyra is an orphan sent to live with her uncle Asriel (Daniel Craig). Asriel works closely with a society of scholars, and the college sees to Lyra's care and education. Asriel uncovers the mystery of Dust - a substance that has some unknown connection to a person's soul. Against the efforts of the Magisterium - a faceless theocratic government - Asriel travels north to learn more about Dust. He leaves without Lyra, but she still gets to travel north. An unknown woman with influence - Ms. Coulter (Nicole Kidman) - convinces the college to release Lyra into her care for a journey into the north. Before Lyra leaves, the president of the college gives her an alethiometer, a one-of-a-kind artifact that can tell the truth of any question asked. These story elements are all initially disconnected, but start entangling very quickly as Lyra becomes an important figure in a power struggle between the scholars and the government in the search for answers about Dust.As a trilogy of books, His Dark Materials is highly symbolic and anti-religion. The Golden Compass should not pose a problem for parents who are concerned about the portrayal of religion - this movie (and the first book, for that matter) don't get very deep into anti-establishment attitudes. The mystery of Dust is hyped, but explained only briefly by Ms. Coulter as evidence of human defiance of The Authroity. The Magisterium is vilified, but it's not entirely clear in the movie that it's a metaphor for the Church. It will be interesting to see how these attitudes will develop through the next two movies, when the conflicts are laid clear and heavenly entities enter the fray.The main problem with The Golden Compass lies in execution. We've all seen the CGI-fantasy movies, and it takes more than fantastical creatures to make a memorable movie now. The style of The Golden Compass is very familiar, with everything washed in gold and backlights, a violin-heavy score, a giant CGI predator, and a bevy of minor adult characters that lend their names to the posters and their aid to the heroic efforts of children. Narnia, anyone? The Golden Compass being marketed as a RING turning into a compass doesn't help much, as this is not really even the same sort of story or audience as Lord of the Rings.We like watching most fantasy movies as adults, because they're typically made to suit a happy medium. The Golden Compass may have been made intentionally for children, as the story is very lightly handled. The story's editing is nowhere near as smooth and detailed as an adult audience will expect. Each scene is short and action-packed, but little continuity exists between them. Like many movies that were made from much longer books, the creators must have really struggled to keep everything from the book in the movie. There were still some things missing, but the general effect is that too much is going on, and none of it seems to be connected. This works for movies like Harry Potter, where all of the audience has read the book, but I'm not sure The Golden Compass can assume as much.The experience is entertaining, but often confusing. Pullman's alternate world is intriguing, there's never a dull moment, and everyone loves a movie where the protagonist is a cheeky little girl. But The Golden Compass will fail to meet the expectations of many. Fans of the book will be disappointed at the loose treatment of the story. Moviegoers expecting a cohesive plot may have to read the book.",The Golden Compass
373,MarteATmsn,Disappointed,3,8 December 2007,"I'm thinking that I may not be in the majority in my opinion of disappointment with this movie. Granted, I have not read the book and did not know anything of the story except what I had seen in the trailers on TV. And maybe that makes all the difference...To have read the book and be knowledgeable of the story would probably help smooth out some of the parts that seemed to be unfinished before transitioning to a different scene. Such as the poor Uncle/Father who seems to just disappear and not be connected to the rest of the story...oh I know he is mentioned later but it's almost as if the director pasted that in after one of those, ""...oh sh**t! I forgot about him!...Who is he again?"", moments. Then of course there is the ending...What exactly is she (Lyra) supposed to do next? Is this the end? Or is it to continue in the next movie? It's not clear from the dialog...oh yeah, I forgot to read the book before seeing it.

374,dave88-2,a good try,7,20 December 2007,"This was a good try, though it did zip along at a ferocious rate at times. If you haven't read the books first you will be utterly lost. The lead actress is excellent and carries the film. I would still unreservedly recommend this, despite some fans being disappointed.As to the anti religion accusations, where was the controversy? I saw this with my wife, who is very Catholic, and she found nothing to make her wince or get up and leave.The real worry now is that with the atrocious box office the other two won't get made. Its a moot point now whether the bigots have won or whether the general public just did not like it.Just be grateful they can't ban the books I guess.Okay, slight update to the above. As of 10th January 2008, the atrocious American take at the box office has been somewhat alleviated by the rest of the world not caring about it allegedly being anti-God. Plus many would argue that anything really controversial has been left out or massively sanitized anyway. Owing to that, its now standing at $300 million, not brilliant but perhaps enough to make the sequels get made. Hasn't opened in Japan yet so cross your fingers that it does the business there too.With it taking nearly as much in England as America I'm tempted to say it was the bigots that did kill it and that it wasn't that the public just simply did not like it. I mean you can argue the books are bigger in England but even then it is so rare for the box office in England to almost match the American take for the same film.Either way here's to the sequels.You can make a violent film, a sexy film, a film with bags of swearing, but if you question the man upstairs (or even whether there IS a man upstairs) its beyond the pale.Americans bang on about the First Amendment all the time but how free a country is it if you can't even make a film without getting boycotted?

It is a great big adventure, where peoples souls exist outside their body, called daemons. They exist as animals which feel the same things as their human bodies.The film begins in a school in England, but the adventures see our young brave characters travel to northern countries. There is plenty of action within the film and a good original plot makes it a great watch.The only downside could be the slightly fake graphics at times & the sudden ending, but generally the graphics are excellent - so much of it has been done on the computer but looks realistic.In conclusion, I give this film 7/10, meaning very good. Its an all age action adventure suitable for anybody, it is a film which you can definitely not call boring!",The Golden Compass
376,UltraVenom,Awesome I loved it!,10,4 August 2008,"This movie was fantastic if you ask me. I don't know what Entertainment Weekly is whining about. For that matter I don't understand all the hate from most His Dark Materials fans. When I first saw this movie last December I hadn't read the book yet. I planned to read His Dark Materials before the movie was out, but I never got the chance. I saw the movie not having a clue what the book was like. But as much as I liked the movie I read the book about 2 weeks later after I saw it. The book was really good as well. They cut out the last three chapters. But as I know they are saving the final cut for the sequel The Subtle Knife. The movie also was trying to avoid the mention of God which is called The Authority in Lyra's World. So yes, I will admit they watered the film down. I guess that is why most people hated it.Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. I honestly will admit I prefer to go see in theaters a new His Dark Materials movie before I would ever go watch Narnia or Harry Potter at the theater. Harry Potter and Narnia I usually will just catch on DVD. But His Dark Materials is a must see Fantasy for me. Another part of nip picking I'm sick of about The Golden Compass is people keep complaining it is too Family Friendly. I disagree it doesn't seem to be a little kids movie at all. It has plenty of fighting, killing, and disturbing scene like the Intercision machine scene to where the movie's rating PG13 fits in with what is in the movie.Now I got to talk about the cast. I loved the new comer Dakota Blue Richards for Lyra, she made the movie really enjoyable for me, and I wish she won her Nomination for Best Child Actress. Daniel Craig for Lord Asriel was just great. I'm glad Craig had such an interest to be in this movie. I really started liking his acting after his role as Lord Asriel. I sure hope we get the sequels to see how Craig will be with his dark ways. Nicole Kidman I was unhappy with at first, because she doesn't look much like Ms. Coulter from the books at all. But she grew on me to where I thought she did just find, and I hope she returns for the sequels as well as the rest of the cast I loved.I could go one for hours about how good of a movie this was. I hate the fact that while I'm on message boards on this site I have been lampooned for liking this film. But what can I saw the Internet is full of trolls that have nothing better to do. Anyways I recommend The Golden Compass to anyone that likes the Fantasy genre. I hope the sequels will be green-lighted so I can have just as much fun watching them as I did with this film. 10 out of 10",The Golden Compass
377,chas65,Don't waste your hard earned cash on this!,2,8 December 2007,"What were the geniuses at New Line thinking when they decided to represent this as anything close to ""The Lord Of The Rings"". Those movies were based on an intelligently, creative and well written trilogy of books, whereas this one certainly is not. It was so poorly done that disparate information seemed to appear from nowhere in order to setup the next two movies. Let's hope, based on this disaster of a movie, that there will be no further movies. I for one will certainly not be wasting my money on these, if they are made.The score was poor (at best), but the reason for giving this movie 2 out of 10 (and not 1 as the story and movie deserved) was the special effects and scenery.",The Golden Compass
378,theninjahowl,Mehh,5,12 March 2012,"After watching this movie all I could really remember was a compass and a polar bear. The visuals were good, the acting was OK, but the story was hard to follow, and even though I liked the fight scenes in this movie, I still wanted to follow the story, which was impossible. If I wanted to watch fights I would watch an action, but this movie was an Adventure genre. It was also titled as a family movie as well when there are pretty graphic things, child abuse, animal abuse, bears drinking alcohol, okay the drunk polar bear was pretty cool. Other people may think other wise but I didn't really like this movie that much, especially the ending. I'd give this film a 5 out of 10 but only because I like the fight scenes.",The Golden Compass
379,Gazza77,Appalling Chrismas Cash-In!,2,13 December 2007,"Right, let's cut to the chase here. It's been a while since I have seen such a blatant cash cow in action. Plot is nearly non-existent and problems that the viewer is presented with in the course of the story are almost immediately put to rest which kills any tension that could have been present. Characters pop in and out of the action whenever the paper thin plot sees fit. We don't get much background info as to why some things are the way they are in the world of the golden compass. The purpose of the witches for example is completely beyond me. It seems as though they are only there to provide cannon fodder for the last battle in the movie. Is there nothing good about this movie? Mmmm, the bears are well made but hardly make up for the rest of this disaster.Worst of all is the last scene in the movie which almost made me sick (a vision of a big-shot movie director counting his dollars immediately came to mind)where the girl says something like : ""we will have great adventures -you, me, Mr Ice-bear, Mrs Witch and Mr Balloon-pilot-"" after which the end credits roll. If it were up to me, no sequel should ever be allowed.This movie will probably be a huge hit this Christmas because of lack of competition. Completely undeserved if you ask me. Steer clear at all costs...",The Golden Compass
380,fun2bebratty,Excellent Movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,10,10 December 2007,"I was afraid to see the movie, but I am so happy that I didn't listen to the fools who hated it. It was nicely cast, with incredible special effects. The story was original, and very interesting. I understand sometimes when you read the book and see the movie you may be very critical, but if people can get past that, they would see the movie for what it is. It is very bright and there is no down time, so you will not fall asleep. The acting was perfect, and the animated animals were great! I go to a movie at least once a month so this is not coming from an amateur. If your willing to be light hearted and just going to enjoy a movie, and not pick on every little thing, with out a doubt you will enjoy this. All you need is an imagination, and be willing to see it for it is..... a delightful well done flick. I think this is a must see, even the critics say the acting was great and the special effects were excellent. So what more do you need?",The Golden Compass
381,jumpy5,Pan's Labrynth and The Goldern Compass,9,11 December 2007,"These are two very important films. They both speak to the struggle one faces if he or she is to live an authentic life. Both deal with the subject of defiance towards authority and the dangerous search to reconnect with one's true self. Pan's Ophelia and Lyra, the hero of the Golden Compass, are seen participating in one act of disobedience after another. However, the films remains true to the honesty of such defiance  one must be disobedient, but only in the pursuit to obtain obedience to one's own self. I suggest that everyone watch these two films and compare them. If they speak to you, you might find the works of Joseph Campbell do so as well. Their teachings are truly a gift.",The Golden Compass
382,Culfy,Looks Good - but lacking plot and characterisation.,4,31 December 2007,"As an aside, I've often wondered how people who haven't read the book managed to cope with Peter Jackson's film trilogy of Lord of the Rings? Never mind following the plot, how did they manage without the joys of seeing Bilbo's petrified trolls in the Fellowship, of recognising Gimli's speech on Dwarf women from the appendix, of shouting ""Oi! What the bloody hell are elves doing at Helm's Deep""I was put into this situation myself with The Golden Compass, having not read the Philip Pullman novels, so I was unable to complain about how like they totally got Lyra's character wrong; how the speech said by Lee Scorsby in the film was originally said by a minor character cut out from the screenplay or how Iorek Byrnison was originally an aardvark and not a polar bear or whatever. Which is a pity because without this potential pleasure, the Golden Compass managed to be one of the most tedious cinematic experiences this year.Part of the problem is the casting of the child actress Dakota Blue Richards as Lyra - the archetypal Girl On Whom The Fate of the World Rests. Instead of bringing this across; Dakota seems more burdened by a much greater problem; that of trying to keep up her Oliver style cockernee street kid accent. Which unfortunately left a gaping hole at the centre of the movie; at no point did I ever feel like any grave consequences ever rested on any of the actions of Lyra.But the fault does not lie entirely with Dakota. Allegedly, the makers of the film removed much of the atheistic content of the novel; in doing so they seem to have removed most of the characterisation and the plot from the novel as well. Nicole Kidman goes round Acting for a bit but never reaches the chilling intensity of her roles in the Others and To Die For. Daniel Craig goes round Acting for a bit before realising that Bond 22 is likely to be a better bet for an Oscar and so buggers off for most of the film. At one point Nicole Kidman reveals that she is really Lyra's mother and Daniel Craig's character is really her father; a revelation which I'm sure meant a lot more in the book.I'm certainly sure that the titular Golden Compass was a lot better used in the novel than the Deus Ex Machina it becomes in the film. A device which the Evil Magisterium wants to capture for their own ends allows Lyra to discover the answer to every question instantly (after a bit of 'follow your heart' type advice) which provides a convenient way of solving any difficulties along the way.This perfunctory approach to plotting is at its worst at the end of the film with the Epic End Battle. Lyra leads a band of children away from the evil Magisterium only to be stopped by the baddies. Fortunately the giant polar bear turns up and helps them. Unfortunately the giant polar is tied up. Fortunately he is saved by a group of witches. Unfortunately the flying witches are shot at by the baddies. Fortunately a flying cowboy comes and rescues everyone. And it all ends happily ever after in about ten minutes. Come on, I know the Heroic Sacrifice is a bit cliché but I think we needed at least goodie to bite the dust to give some sense of jeopardy to proceedings.On the plus side, the film at least looked good; the demons being particularly well realised. And Ian McKellan once again, after the Da Vinci Code, shows his ability to the steal the scene. But New Line Cinema are showing that the return of Peter Jackson to direct their fantasy films could not be soon enough.",The Golden Compass
383,bobralph2001,A tragic waste of imagination,1,29 June 2009,"I am a religious person, and when I first heard about the content of this movie, I had very mixed feelings about whether or not to watch it.Well, I finally did. It was dull save for the storyline involving the armored bears. Good special effects, but they didn't jump out and give you a sense of awe like Transformers did that same year, or Pirates of the Caribbean and Spider-Man 3 for that matter.Even though they removed the words that might refer to religion and God, it was painfully obvious in imagery what the bad guys are. You don't need to see the word bear on a picture of one to know it's a bear. So, all the people worrying about how anti-religious it was: you were right. It was there. In this movie, religious people are control freak Nazi's while immature people with big mouths like Lyra are good. Granted, not all religious people are nice people, but in this movie, they were ALL bad and Orwellian tyrants and servants of tyrants.Lord of the Rings it was not, especially in a very flat final battle scene with no real sense of excitement like the Mines of Moria or the Battle of Pelennor from the Lord of the Rings Trilogy.When I first saw David Lynch's Dune back in 1996, it wasn't the greatest of movies. But it had a good storyline, and it made me rush to read the book and it's sequels.After watching this tragedy, I have no interest whatsoever in reading the books.Oh, and any of you pro-Golden Compass fans that want to take me to task for loving the Lord of the Rings and sticking with my pro-religious anti-atheism stance and plan to email me your views: Shut Up. You aren't going to convert me.",The Golden Compass
384,KentHandlet,poor storytelling because of poor direction,6,8 December 2007,"i wasn't expecting too much when i entered the theater to watch the golden compass. it was the first time i had read the book before seeing the movie, so i new i kinda figured i'd be disappointed. but i didn't think it would be that bad. first off, the beginning with the narrator telling the story of dust and parallel worlds was terrible, how stupid do they think we are. even people who didn't read that books could have figured it out by the end. we should have discovered it as Lyra did in the book. the movie had a lot mistakes like this, things that were changed from the book. Why? it would have been easier and better if they would have went with the book. they even changed around the order a bit. The worst part about the changes was that the story didn't follow Lyra the entire time, like it was in the book. It didn't feel like an adventure. every couple of minutes it would jump to a completely different scene, nothing could get established. the dialog was lousy. it was too fast, and unrealistic. i noticed that they tried to explain a lot about the story through the dialog from Lyra to other characters, which would be understandable in any other movie, but they didn't take advantage of the fact that Lyra can pretty much think out loud by talking to Pantalaimon. They made everything too obvious in this movie instead of letting people figure things out for themselves. it seemed like it was geared towards little kids. the book had a lot of adult themes that added to the complexity of the story, when they took all of these out it left the story dull. The music was terrible. worse than terrible. they spent 150 mil on this movie and completely neglected the importance of the music? sad. the music wouldn't have saved the movie but it would have definitely helped it. the music in narnia for example, the music was so good that even though i hated the movie i watched it again to see how good the music matched up with the movie. the director ruined the movie. there was a lot of potential too. the casting was awesome. the girl who played Lyra was almost perfect. Lee Scorsby was great. The voice of Pan was awesome, Serafina Pekkala was great. Mrs. Coulter was great. Asriel was great. besides the ugly roger kid, the casting was perfect. I also enjoyed the special effects for the daemons. the cinematography in the first half of the movie is awesome too. it seems a little rushed in the end. or maybe claustrophobic. Svalbard for example. in the book the place sounds huge. in the movie it looks like a small cave or something. the ending was terrible also. no resolution. i doubt they'll make the sequel, but if they do it'll be bad because from the get go so much in the story is gonna change and for people who didn't read the book they aren't going to understand how they should feel about certain characters. i hope the movie doesn't give the books a bad reputation",The Golden Compass

I was concerned about the content and message of the story given all the controversy and comments I read on the internet.Know what? I thought it was a good movie. I would not take my 4 year old daughter to see it since it is a little intense.But, I happily took my 9 yr old daughter to see it the next day. I didn't mention any of the religious implications of the movie before hand and only mentioned them after she saw the movie ... she had no idea what I was talking about. We both just enjoyed the movie for what it was - a fantasy adventure.I don't give it more than an 8 since the graphics were a little lacking and the story even seemed a little light; there were a *lot* of loose ends.

386,stephen-mercer,"A butchering of the book, but with good acting",3,8 December 2007,"My vote of ""three"" is entirely for the quality of the acting. Because if I had to judge only by the script, I give this a ""one."" A character learns something. They run back to tell the others. But instead of telling them, the next line we get is one of those other characters saying, ""Don't worry dear, we'll take care of it."" WHAT???? Are all characters psychic? Mystically endowed with the knowledge of whatever any other character wishes to tell them? This sort of discontinuity happens several times in the story (most notably when Lyra finds Billy, for those of you who know the book).Further, everyone in this story is GOOD or EVIL, and this is entirely determined by accent. If you have a lilting happy voice, you are GOOD. A dour, dark growl, you are EVIL. Except one bear, who gets the comforting deep grandfather voice. All the subtlety of the book is GONE. No one has any conflicts over what to do. There's no dissension in the ranks. There's no question of right or wrong. Isn't that the whole point of _The_Golden_Compass_? Hello? Free-will? Nope, not in this movie.Oh, and if you know the book, be prepared for the movie to end about four chapters back from the end of the book.In short, the first three fourths of the book is butchered and the last fourth is missing.I don't think I'll bother with the two movie sequels.",The Golden Compass
387,serennishiyama,Truly a tragedy. Hopefully the film studios have learned a lesson.,1,4 December 2008,"I must admit that I am not a fan of Pullman's novels. I have read them, and understand his point of view. But when I read a fantasy novel, I want adventure, not a dogmatic sermon. We get it. You hate the Church. Yawn!Now the problem with the film The Golden Compass is that although Pullman had a large amount of influence on it, it appears that he completely sold out his ideals for the cash. The movie only vaguely resembles the novel on which it is based. Almost all of the anti-religious references are absent. In short, Pullman did not stand up for his artistic integrity and preserve the central themes of his book. Apparently he didn't have much artistic integrity if this film is the result. The film suffers from dull storytelling that the simply awful director(s) hoped would be glossed over by flashy CGI. All in all this film was a waste of time and money. I literally felt myself age while watching it.",The Golden Compass
388,Kimimela,An interesting so-and-so,8,7 March 2008,"I had never heard of Philip Pullman and his ""His dark materials""-trilogy before I saw this movie the first time, and it left me slightly unsatisfied at the time, but definitely interested in the books.I read ""The Golden Compass"" not long after I had seen the movie the first time, and when having done so, I felt I needed to see the movie again, so I rented it. This time, I felt much more satisfied with the movie, and I was again blown away by the visual effects. I completely understand why this movie got an Oscar for Best Visual Effects and a BAFTA for Special Visual Effects. The attention to detail is stunning, and makes you feel like Lyra's world is just within grasp.As for the actors, I was both impressed and slightly disappointed. Kidman was (as always) brilliant in her role as the posh, ice villain Mrs Coulter, I felt chills down my spine several times. As for Dakota Blue Richards, playing Lyra Belacqua, I was almost equally impressed. Richards put so much spirit and force into her character, and I hope we'll see more of her in the future. Mr Bond himself, Daniel Craig did a so-and-so performance, it feels like his character got cut back, in my opinion because of the script. My over all favourite in this movies, though, is Sam Elliot's Lee Scoresby. Elliot's portrayal of the Texan aeronaut is fantastic, and when I read the book I couldn't have imagined him any other way.As with every movie based on a book, there are things you have to cut out, and though many have criticized Chris Wentz for the screenplay, I'm not entirely disappointed. Having read the books now, I think Wentz did a good work of cutting out moments that weren't entirely necessary, and the changes he made into scenes both in the book and movie don't bother me too much. I was a bit bugged by the ending, I would much rather have had the original book-ending the one in the movie.Overall, I found the movie a bit uneven. The prologue was a bit too explanatory, taking away part of the mystery, and the dialogue was at times lumpy. This, however, was compensated most times by the actors and their non-verbal performances.There have been much talk about whether or not there will be a sequel. I very much hope for a sequel, it feels so wrong to start but not finish this trilogy. It was perhaps not the best film I've seen, but it definitely got me interested.",The Golden Compass

Okay, fine, the filmmaker tried to stay as true to a scary kids' movie, but when you realize that staying true to the original play prevents you from making a decent movie, wouldn't you just move on to a different project?

If you are not familiar with Puttman's Dark Materials, then stick closely with the first fifteen minutes for background material.The cinematography is stunning. It is wonderful to have digital enhancements reaching the point that if feels real. The Golden Compass truly creates a separate universe.I found this much more emotionally accessible then the LOR set of films. Dakata Blue Richardson can be so very young and vulnerable AND so very old and wise at the same time.

391,z46629,"Deus ex machinae, writ large",2,11 January 2008,"This was, in short, an appalling film. It had so much promise -- the trailer had enticed me for half a year at least and the big name stars in the billing added to the attraction. Having spoken to friends who have read the book, I'm convinced that the starting material had much potential. But the adaptation disappointed as few have before it.There are three major issues with this film, which can be revealed without any spoilers. The first, ironically (given Pullman's atheism), is the repeated use of deus ex machina devices to save the main character from impending doom. The first instance jars badly enough; the many repeated examples merely serve to complete the dissociation of audience from film. If nothing else, this screenplay serves as a cautionary tale as to why deus ex machinae are bad plot devices.Second on the list is the repeated use of ""watchman devices"" to take the place of plot development. (Want to cut suddenly to an unrelated scene without any prior lead-up material? Just get the main character in it to give a brief synopsis as to why they have to be there, and why they're in danger.) Several scenes in particular smack at best of poor editorial cutting in post-production. At worst, they suggest screen-writing by rank amateurs.Finally, the big problem with this film is the lack of character development. Only Nicole Kidman's character has any depth or subtlety (although Daniel Craig's character at least gives unfulfilled hints of it). The rest are mere cardboard cut-outs, almost laughable in their simplicity. We have the heroic-character-brought-low-by-liquor, the simple-but-wise-Texan-cowboy, the misunderstood-outcasts, the evil-villain (replete with oily hair follicles, and helpfully dressed in black), the brave-and-plucky-child ... If it only had a shred of humour, you could at least call it a farce.Ultimately, this seems to have been a golden opportunity to adapt a book which has been completely wasted by Chris Weitz. I can think of only two reasons to see this film: either to appreciate the impressive CGI, or to laugh at its ineptitude.",The Golden Compass

Its not as harmful as Christians would want you to believe. I'm an atheist and I don't boycott Christian movies. The fact that Christians are boycotting movie just proves Philip Pullmans point that Christians don't want us to think out side the box. If anything we should be boycotting the Sex and the City movie. God, that's going to be just horrible. I judge a movie more on its quality rather then its subject matter.

However a very important climax in the story that leads up the third book (The Amber Spyglass) didn't happen in the movie.

The movie opens very much like ""The Lord of the Rings"" but the exposition is much more forced, which kind of tells you how the rest of the movies is going to come off....very very forced. The acting isn't great, probably because there is 0 character development and the music is anything but good. The story would be good if it had been presented better but it was a bit hacked up and presented very poorly. It was enough to inspire me to read the book though, mostly because I'm hoping for something more. The gem of the whole flick is the special effects, but since good CG is commonplace now, it really ends up being white noise and does nothing to make the movie stand out.At no point did I consider walking out and I didn't really want my time or money back, but I'd suggest at least going to the early show so as not to spend as much.

397,Ferisam,What if there would be censorship? ...or there would be none at all?,2,2 February 2008,"First i have to say, that, while summarizing this and thinking about the bad writing, the soon to be obvious plot holes (in the following movies), the high cast but moderate acting and the loss of the serious critic intended by Philip Pullman, i am angry, not to have given only 1 point. This, because i have to bear to watch it again, to pick up all the annoying bits and pieces of this wreck of a should be serious fantasy movie.All in all i agree with IMDb-member Luke Ewing, he pointed out a lot about the movie-making, acting, guessed production-intentions and aura of the movie already, so i wont go into this again. He summons it up quite nicely, i was even happy to see, that i am not alone with my feelings about recent 'fanatsy hits' like Eragon and Narnia, childish interpretations of only moderate novels.But my accusation goes farther in many ways. Escpecially regarding the writing and the plot. I was quite angry at the books a few times, wanting to throw one into a corner and never to look at it again. But well, it is a good concept, a lot of fantasy and in the end mostly conclusive, so i managed to finish them. And in the end, i am quite pleased to have read them, not only to learn from the complexity of events, but to recognize mistakes and hopefully do it better one day myself. But the movie manages to destroy that and leaves nothing except fancy pictures of not even top notch CGI, that would have been possible. It is not a children's bock, but it is a movie for childish (not childlike) people. There is great children and teenager literature out there, and films that even excite me as and adult. I watch those over and over again as for the first time and still enjoy them enormously. But the writer, and i don't know, if this was by the dictated intention of the studio, broke the serious critic of Mr. Pullman and portrayed the characters wrongly, made them unbelievable (some only had little in the book and lost all of it now) and easy to accept and forget, once the movie is over, leaving no argument, just a memory of a wasted evening. -The evil magesterium is the church and all orders of authority, no matter which religion is focused on here. All the critic is lost, all the focus is gone, because the magesterium looks more like a military dictatorship with officials, then the body of the church. Should we not connect them with the similar institutions we have here in reality ? Maybe we are not wanted to. But in the end it doesn't surprise me, this movie is made by and for a society, that allows a homeland security to exist, has crosses and prayers in school, pledges to a flag, sings the national anthem on all events, tries to make up a history of culture ('National Treasure' ring a bell?) and lives a superficial, miserable, but patriotic life, no questions asked. Maybe they need a tuned down version of critic, or a cheap flick, that is no real threat at all....Well, so much for intentions. But back to the movie itself. Why is it, that characters saying things they did not in the book and should not do so anywhere else. Why does the magesterium call the 'Experimental Station' Bolvanger, the 'Evil Field', as the sensitive locals do? Why are whole events switched, or mixed up ? Why is Lord Asriel asking for founding an expedition, if he is walking alone? Why is there no child (in darkness) in the picture he shows. Why is Dust not surrounding the man, but flowing into him and disappearing ? Why does everybody know, what is going to happen and what is important, and why do they say so - if all this is about choice, why is Lira making NONE by herself ? Why does the lackey of the magesterium instead of the Master of Jordan trying to poison Lord Asriel - leaving Lira no (in the book very hard) choice again? Why doesn't Lord Asriel kill Roger to open the barrier between the worlds ??? - The main act of this book and relevant for about 8 chapters in the third book of His Dark Materials ??? Maybe we need good and bad characters, so Lord Asriel can not kill Roger for the gain of his Republik. And the Master of Jordan can not poison Lord Asriel for his own reasons. There is conscious thought and there is necessity. Whatever good and evil means, it is in all of us. Every man is capable of great and/or terrible deeds. - That is free will, that is choice.

Then i heard nicole kidman was going to be in it and my heart sunk. I am not a nicole kidman fan at all. Phillip Pullmans books were amazing. But the actors that were chosen to portray his characters were awful. 1) Lyra did not look at all like i thought she was going to look, the actress that plays her was horrible, it was like she was just reading a script the whole time, she was very unconvincing. 2) Lord Asril was not at all how i expected either. 3) The guy from ghost rider was a poor choice as all i could think about was how he was in that movie. 4) the golden monkey is supposed to be a feared character but ended up looking completely ridiculous. The movie looked incredible, the graphics were impressive. nicole kidman actually ended up giving a good performance. overall i think the girl who played Lyra dragged the whole movie down and i believe if there is no sequel then it will be because of her. i strongly recommend that if they do decide to tell the rest of the story they should recast lyra.",The Golden Compass
399,jonathanhara,I don't get it?,3,10 December 2007,"The trailers for the Golden Compass made it look exciting and fresh, but I left the theater feeling confused and unsatisfied. I think they really could have set up the story better with a better/longer opening narrative. There was just too much thrown at the audience (especially those who haven't read the books like me) at one time. My wife and I must have looked at each other with puzzled looks like 15 times during the movie. And then it just ended, without any real answers to the questions buzzing around in my brain. It didn't leave me thirsty for more, just annoyed. I heard several groans in the the theater when the end credits came up. I definitely cannot recommend this movie to anyone. Perhaps if they do film the entire series, I'll watch it on DVD.",The Golden Compass
400,sammyd_dominatin_mc,The Northern Lights,9,8 December 2007,"I just watched this movie at the Odeon Cinema in Oxford, quite a short walk the real locations which inspired those in this story and it's sequels. And I must say that despite any negative sides to the film, I really enjoyed it.I read the books several years ago and all three books are some of my all-time favourites (especially the first and third). There is one aspect in particular which keeps the heart and soul of the movie precisely like that of the book on which it is based. It's Lyra. For such a young actress, the one that plays her is some kind of prodigy. However I pictured Lyra beforehand, I was quickly convinced that the girl on the screen was the one that I had read about and been moved to care deeply about as a character. Phillip Pullman's true gift to the world, whatever he did before and whatever he does after, has been to tell Lyra's story and Dakota Richards is clearly an equal to Pullman in this respect.The rest of the cast is also impressive. Daniel Craig and Nicole Kidman are near-perfect in their roles as, respectively, the enigmatic Lord Asriel and the chilly and rather inhuman Mrs Coulter. Their acting and lines were very suitable for this movie but I hope that they are given more screen time in the sequels as their relationships with each other and with Lyra are very important to the overall story. The dude who played Lee Scoresby was very good but the audience need to be more emotionally interested in him for his demise in ""The Subtle Knife"" to move be as moving as it is in the book. The same can be said really for all the recurring characters. It seemed slightly odd to me that there were appearances from both the LOTR wizards. Although Ian Mckellen was brilliant as the voice of Iorek Byrnison, I thought the inclusion of Christopher Lee was unnecessary, considering the small role he plays (although he does have a great bad-guy voice), as somehow having these two together in another fantasy movie rather spoilt the suspension of disbelief for me.The plot did come across as slightly hurried for me, and in fact that's the main problem I have with this movie and what stops it getting that 10/10 rating. I understand that it was difficult to translate the movie to a screenplay but it could have done with another half-hour as the scenes that aren't skipped past are very well acted and gripping. Indeed, all those flashy montages really did detract from the exciting and intelligent storyline.Still, I am very pleased with this movie and it's easily the best release of '07, or at least the best that I've seen. It would definitely stand up next to Fellowship if it wasn't for the pacing problems. The acting was first-class, the CG was impressive and, at times, stunning, particularly that iconic and literally jaw-dropping moment at the climax of the fight between Iorek and Ragnar (I guess Iofur sounds too similar to Iorek, but I think this name-change was unnecessary).One thing that I was not expecting was for the look of the movie to be so close to how it had been in my mind when I was reading the novel, the world that Lyra lives in is masterfully realised, that kind of quasi-Victorian feel is just right with enough modern-touches to remind us that when Asriel says '99 he means 1999. The director was clearly an attentive and thoughtful fan of the novels (surprising for a man whose forte seemed to be creative toilet-humour) and it is certainly the best movie that he has directed.So, despite it's failings, this is an impressive and tragically almost-epic movie, it's actors and dialogue are it's strongpoint and it's a shame that they were given so little of an innings. Lyra was wonderful, the effects and overall look were dazzling, the score, though generic, was effective and there were few Hollywood-movies to take away the fact that this is at-heart an indie film.Jut one final, little, complaint. Why the hell did they change the name? I know it's not important, but as the UK version of the book was given a much better title than the American one, why didn't they use it? If I can hazard a guess, it's because ""The Golden Compass"" fits in with the titles of the sequels and ""The Northern Lights"" does not. The fact is, though, that the story is not about the Alethiometer (I forget how it's actually spelt), it is about Lyra's journey North, a journey that would take her through the sky, even if they have cut out that ending.Oh, and a note on religion. I don't know what's funnier or more infuriating; the fact that Christians seem to immediately have a go at anything that challenges their extremely small and petty worldview, or that they would judge this movie on what they're told by their preachers without even watching it. I wish I could say that this isn't most Christians, but the best I can say is that it's not your average UK church-goer. What's wrong with these Bible-belt idiots? are they braindead from birth or are they brainwashed by the hypocrites they look to for guidance? I should say that I'm not an atheist, my personal faith is just that and shouldn't effect my rational thoughts, though I applaud people like Richard Dawkins and Phillip Pullman for trying to make people think. I also can't praise the Archbishop of Canterbury enough for using his brain and not his bible.",The Golden Compass

404,digital_smurf_burglar,A huge disappointment,1,23 March 2008,"I'm not going to harp on about how much a fan i am of the books (although admittedly when i discovered these way back in the mid/late nineties i was hugely impressed), however due to the fact that this is a screenplay based on the books; i may digress. I'll start how i mean to go on.... on a low note! From the first words uttered of the narration i knew that this film would be a disappointment. Looking back at l.o.t.r, special effects can indeed be special, however no matter what i have heard from film reviewers on T.V, these do disappoint, as do the costumes and sets. Everything seems just 'fake,' it all resembles the shoddy sets and costumes you see on made for t.v programmes (i'm thinking Dr Who or the Indiana Jones Chronicles). It all seems all a bit too much in place for, example the poor wearing rags that are as clean as the day they were made. There is just no eye for detail in this movie, all the props LOOK like they were made for the film, even down to the non CGI buildings. Thats that for the physical faults with the film. The actual cinematography, the panning of shots and editing would i'm sure would look better should the actual backgrounds look believable but still it just looks cheaply made and put together by a first year film student. Setting apart Eva Green and Sam Elliot who are by far act best parts, all the actors have let themselves down. I don't expect adults to act as if they believe in the characters in a fantasy novel, but even the the children manage to put in more ham than the meat counter at a butchers, even the extra's and minor characters look as if they don't belong. The accents are over exaggerated and so is the delivery. This film could have been so much more and it breaks my heart to write all this but this really is an awful picture. Think of the original Harry Potter and also Chronicles of Narnia, well they beat this hands down. Hopefully like the harry films the direction, acting and effects will improve with each film, the only problem is there are only 3 parts to this story where it took the producers of Harry Potter double that to get even a watchable movie. Alarm bells are ringing. To end as i started, the plot line has more holes in it than a sieve, the director hasn't even tried to stick to the book, and i'm not sure just how everything is going to fit together in the end, as in the books, every last detail is relevant and due to the fact that the director left chunks out and just seemed to add parts to the story leaves me with the impression that he knew this would be his first and last in the series, and that as long as he got the film finished it would be somebody else's problem making the follow ups to tie up loose ends and fill in the gaps. All in all - Don't bother with this film, read the books and use your imagination. It'll be far more satisfying and realistic.",The Golden Compass

Instead, they walk (or fly) beside them as ""daemons,"" an animal/insect/reptile representation that can talk to them. It's based on volume one of Philip Pullman's mega-hit fantasy trilogy, published in the U.S. as ""The Golden Compass,"" ""The Subtle Knife,"" and ""The Amber Spyglass."" Newcomer Dakota Blue Richards really holds the screen as Lyra, an orphan who has a special place at Jordan College because her uncle, Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig), teaches there. Something's happening to the children, though. Legend has it that ""gobblers"" are taking those who disappear, and when Lyra's friend Roger is taken, she's determined to rescue him.As with any screen adaptation, those who've read the books will probably be a little disappointed, while those who haven't will be a little confused. It's possible to get the gist of things if you aren't familiar with the novel, but you really have to pay attention. You've probably heard that his is an ""atheist"" version of C.S. Lewis's Christian fantasies, but Pullman says he was just doing an update of Milton's ""Paradise Lost""--and Milton included pagan as well as Christian elements in his epic poem about the fall of man and original sin. This complicated version involves, on the evil side, a Magisterium government trying to keep the people under its thumb (much like the last Harry Potter installment), a femme fatale named Mrs. Coulter (Nicole Kidman) who's somehow tied in with the Magisterium and the gobblers, and an evil bear who usurped a faraway kingdom in the icy North.On the good side is a cowboy named Lee Scoresby (Sam Elliot), a nomadic people called the Gyptians, a legion of witches, and a good polar bear named Iorek Byrnison. At the center is the Golden Compass or alethiometer which the headmaster gives Lyra as she heads north. According to witch legend, only certain chosen ones can read the compass, which reveals the truth.To make sense of a 400-page novel in a 113-minute film is a challenge, but director Chris Weitz does a decent job keeping the focus on Lyra as she follows her uncle north and meets challenge after challenge. ""The Golden Compass"" is rated PG-13 for fantasy violence, but the killing is muted by an instant vaporization into sparkly dust. This film is all about dust and the literal/symbolic effects of outside influences, which is why some Christians have been up in arms. But ""The Golden Compass"" ranks right up there with the works of Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien as an engaging allegorical fantasy that holds appeal for the entire family. It's about curiosity and confidence as much as anything else, and children will identify with the devotion Lyra has for her friends is certainly behavior worth modeling.Video QualityThe CGI work earned an Oscar for Visual Effects, and in 1080p (2.35:1 aspect ratio) it's nothing short of visually stunning, with natural but rich-looking colors and strong black levels that hold the detail in dark sequences, and also keep things from looking washed out in the white land of the North. If you focus on the daemons and their fur or movement, you can really appreciate how good the CGI work really is, to stand up under such Hi-Def scrutiny.Audio QualityThe 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio is exclusive to Blu-ray, and it's a powerful, dynamic soundtrack that pushes the sound far from the speakers so that it fills the room. When the bears start growling, you can almost feel your own hair stand on end. Like the video, it's fantastic.Bonus FeaturesExclusive to Blu-ray is an Enhanced Visual Commentary that juggles two pop-up boxes, one which shows the director as he gives his commentary, and the other showing the scene on-camera as it was being filmed. It's bar-none the best commentary I've run across, and the first to hold my 10-year-old son's attention. It's a lesson in film-making that shows how dollys and green screen are used, as well as rough drawings and mock-ups. What makes the commentary work, though, is that Weitz is the kind of guy you like to spend time with. He's easy-going, knowledgeable, unafraid to share secrets (and mistakes), and good-humored. This guy actually read the books and wanted to direct the movie because he loved them. The pop-ups really engage the viewer without diminishing the effect of the film itself. What an entertaining way to learn about a film!Almost as strong are the 11 features on The Novel, The Adaptation, Oxford, Finding Lyra Belacqua, Costumes, Music, Production Design, The Launch, Armoured Bears, The Alethiometer, and Daemons. Pullman is as engaging as the director, and equally self-effacing. With two bright fellows anchoring the extras, and with Weitz having written the screenplay, the bonus features for ""The Golden Compass"" are among the most literate I've seen. There's a lot of information here, but it's presented in a casual, non-academic way.Tru-Blu?""The Golden Compass"" looks and sounds great in Blu-ray, and with a wonderful Blu-ray exclusive enhanced commentary track and solid bonus features on two discs, it's one of the best Blu-ray releases I've seen this year.",The Golden Compass
406,dan-ireson,Rather Awful,4,11 January 2009,"I'm always rather keen to write a user comments page after reading a particularly good or bad review by another user. Sad to say this time it was a rather bad one I had read. Opinions are personal to each and I would not change the viewers or anyone else's but on the belief that these comments listed by viewers might encourage somebody to see a film I feel it important to try and give what I believe is a true account of the films success so please forgive if I seem a little pig-headed about all this. The article in question stated that the viewer was a fan of the novel and had gone to see the film in anticipation of a entertaining version on the big screen. I had much the same reason for my visit. They found it beautiful and wonderful in story and in special effects. They admitted that some points of the story had change as is natural with novels into films but had kept the story true. I am in wonder at how the doctors let this lunatic free from the loony bin. If you are a fan of the book, Northern Lights by Philip Pullman, then I can not see how you could derive any sense of enjoyment from this movie much the same as you would not enjoy seeing a family member being raped before your eyes. And it is a rape. The novel is quite beautiful and the story bold, fantastic, romantic, adventurous and wonderful. Of course you could not take all from the book into the film and may rather suit a well made TV series over three seasons then three two hour films but the main reason to make the film would be to capitalize on a great story and not just roll something out that looked good. The graphics were outstanding but these were not my reason for seeing it. I wanted the interpretation of an imaginative director, cast and crew on screen and not the bungling pokes and prods we were rewarded much like the groping of a spotty thirteen year old trying to cop a handful of a sensuous women on a park bench. The performances were dreadful and the cutting room floor must of been groaning with such vast waves of dire film that the floor might of collapsed beneath it. I will say not much about young Dakota who was cast as Lyra as it does not do to badmouth a youngster but she is not right for the role. Not her fault at all but I think miscast by some odd casting director/director/producer/Inspector Clouseau idiocy which let this unexperienced girl into a mammoth role she was ill-prepared for. Nicole Kidman; dreadful. I think she peaked in The Hours. Plus she looks weird and wax-like with her wardrobe and makeup. Daniel Craig; OK but no depth. Flat and boring. Powerful though which is dead right for the role. Jim Carter; Who thought this was a right move. John Faa is a monster of a man. A leader among brutal, proud and earthy people. he looks homeless and like a pirate. Out of his depth. McKellen; Good voice and has the experience to back it up with better acting with his voice then most did with their whole bodies to use. McShane; Good but his vocal abilities in animation are quite amazing as seen in Kung Fu Panda. Elliot; Wonderfully cast as the Texan. There is no better quintessential cowboy then Ol' Sam.The story changes are just odd. Having Fra Pavel become the nasty and powerful side of the Magisterium. Why that character? In the book he's just the one who reads the Alethiometer for the church. nothing more. Why turn him into the bad guy when the Cardinal would of done so and kept somewhat with the books intentions? Why change the name of the bear Iorek has to fight? Doesn't need to. Ragnus whatever it became. Why change the reason that Iorek was exiled? Originally because he had killed a bear who wouldn't back down to a stronger opponent instead of wounding him. In the film it's because he lost to the soon king Ragnus losing all point about Iorek's character which is that he is the rightful heir and was tricked to fight by the back handed prince (later king). So, you mean Iorek loses fairly and then has the nerve to come back and fight even though he doesn't deserve the right to. This is the bear we want to win? Sorry but the character would not do that. An armored bear is all about honor and war. There is so much more but needed to get a small bit off my chest after reading that other review.So in summation; Awful film and the ruin of a good story in big screen potential. Thanks Hollywood crap for barfing yet another of your meaningless acidic contents all over us trusting movie goers.YoursAngry Dan",The Golden Compass
407,kathyjp,Criticised unfairly-Enjoyable fantasy,8,4 April 2009,"I have read the novels and seen the film and have no complaints. This film is wonderful, lots of enjoyment. Criticism is unfounded! The acting was wonderful and the vision beautiful. This is a good fantasy film, which should be viewed as such. The novel of course is wonderful, as is the entire trilogy.It's extremely difficult to put novels to film and many attempts fail, but this film has not failed, the film makers have produced an entertaining fantasy film based on Pullman's novels and have done this well, I believe. So, I disagree with the bad reviews given and the criticism made. If you want the entire rendition of the trilogy read the books but if you would like to watch an entertaining fantasy film I recommend this film. It's a great couple of hours escape from reality into a fantasy world.Perhaps an attempt will be made to create a sequel, I hope so.",The Golden Compass
408,IoreksDaemon,A bad representation of a great book,6,5 April 2015,"If I hadn't read the book before viewing I probably wouldn't have understood much of this movie. While the book is wonderful I found the movie to be far too fast paced with a lot going on in a very short time, one example of this was Mrs. Coulter not having much mystery about her. From very early on in the movie we find out that she is head of ""the gobblers"" while in the book there was a lot more questioning to her character and elements to her that made me think she had a little good in her and that she wanted Lyra for deeper reasons.One big problem I found with the movie was the casting of Daniel Craig as Lord Asriel. While Craig gives a good performance it seems to be a completely different character than what I imagined of Lord Asriel. From the book he seems like a very cold, strict but brilliant man, while in the movie he seems a little aloof and acts fine when Lyra has disobeyed him with nothing really getting on his nerves. Unless I completely misinterpreted the character which I don't think I have from other opinions I have heard I think they should have stuck to basic character traits.Though I do have problems with the movie as a representation of the book, I did find it to be an enjoyable enough movie with incredible special effects which made it beautiful to watch.",The Golden Compass

I love Star Wars, LOTR, Narnia, D&D (not the movie!) but this left me cold.Please don't think i am stupid for not understanding it, i just couldn't be bothered to understand it.The movie was like a poor pantomime, and a clumsy one at that.

410,Horror_Wolf,Not as bad as people let on.,7,13 December 2007,"I just saw this movie about 10 hours ago. I've never read the books, but know the basic summary. I went with a friend who has read the books. I found the film to be enjoyable, a little slow in places but still entertaining. From what I understand from my friend, they changed a few things from the books, but overall it's a faithful adaption. I'm seeing the main problem people are having with this movie is how ""fantastic"" it is(talking animals, multi-verses, etc.). Personally, I like to see things like that because it's different and imaginative. I think the people who are bashing this movie really need to calm down and re-establish their imagination. People are very use to the idea of fantasy within our own world/universe, unless it's space-related ala Star Wars. Please broaden your minds a little. As for Christians banning the movie, all I will say is they are just proving the author right. I value my independent thought. If you're interested in this film, I say give it chance, as I find most reviews unhelpful in the end. Judge for yourself, and hopefully enjoy.",The Golden Compass
411,fleurcarpediem,"Great Expectations to Dismal Failure,....what a shame!",2,30 June 2008,"What a shame! what a terrible shame.Havign read the trilogy in one day flat, I was so looking forward to this movie. I imagined the wonderful landscapes and architecture, the great casting, the mystery, the emotion and just Oxford in Lyra's world.But wait...am I watching a remake of Lord of the Rings? the intro..the voice..and then that STUPID explanation about how daemons are souls living outside peoples bodies in Lyra's world..yeah, thanks for just about stomping out any wonder, and question or mystery right at the beginning of the movie. and what about the Golden Compass..by the time we start the movie we might as well be at the end.And so it goes on..even the opening scene of Lyra moulding the perfect mud ball is reminiscent of the opening scene of Frodo reading his book under the tree... and what is with the dialogue??? Terrible.Lord Asriel: 'I see your daemon still changes shape, it hasn't settled yet."" Lyra: pause... 'yeah' ...cintilating! less is more and all that..not in this case. God, where they did good with the casting the script fails spectacularly. Lord Asriel isn't a nice man in the book..in fact he's a headstrong, selfish bastard but also wildly intelligent chap..yet in this movie he seems to be struggling making up his mind being either a nice uncle to Lyra or being a bastard..it just doesn't work! And whats with the Harry Potteresque photo with waving man? Or the coach which is propelled by ..god knows what it is.. Lyra's world seems futuristic whilst it shouldn't be..it's different, an age gone by where women are supposed to wear skirts or dresses and not trousers..yet you feel strangely propelled to one of George Lucas's Star Wars films.And then...the worst of all...the by now simple technology of CGI...the architecture is sublime, the landscapes beautiful..but wait..it's minus 30 degrees Celcius and yet both bears and people alike seem not at all affected..has global warming already set in here? shouldn't there be little clouds of breath..especially when Iorek and Lyra go off the the little house in the middle of the freezing wastes of Svalbard? I ask you, was the director really such a novice? or was he lazy? Why did he think that it was a good idea to cram as much as possible into 1 hour and 30 minutes when he could have been truer and more successful it he had made it a 2 hour film. Why did he not leave some mystery in there? Why did he brush away the wonderful section about the Gypsies and the great gathering in the hall. Why did they cast such an tremendous idiot in the role of Farder Coram. In the book he is older than old but also wise and strong and really takes Lyra under his protection. In the movie he he portrayed as some dim witted slow talking idiot....what a disappointment! If you ask me this movie was a shambles..a great idea not thought out at all.But apart from all the misery described above, at least the actors were a light. At least the director had an eye for good casting. Lyra is wonderful, and Sam Elliot and absolute gem! He is exactly what I had pictured Lee Scoresby to be like..I hope that like the Harry Potter films..a different director takes this on next time but even more importantly..shall we ask Phil Pullman to write the actual script?",The Golden Compass
412,flexdream,Golden Compass heads South,2,11 December 2007,"What on earth was all the fuss about? This film is dismal, though I was able to endure an hour before giving up. It has a nice steam punk flavour at times, if a little old fashioned. Nicole Kidman looks pretty, Daniel Craig smoulders, er and that's about it. Corny dialogue you really can predict, a dreary plot, and frankly poor child acting. It is funny though how an allegedly anti-Christian film released near Christmas seems to centre on messianic expectations about a child - 'do you think she's the one' etc. Still it's more employment opportunities for British actors, and another British penned fantasy tale brought expensively to the screen by US money, so it's not all bad news for us in the UK. I've agreed with someone I met to read the book, but having seen the film, I think I'll renege on that premature decision. The film lacks menace, interest, humour, action and colour. There will be sequels, which given the low expectations engendered by the first film may well be pleasantly surprising.",The Golden Compass
413,dusk_whisper,"Same problems as other fans, but I'm still optimistic!",9,13 December 2007,"I want to say right away that I was (and am) a tremendous fan of the books. I first read them when I was a child of about twelve and immediately became obsessed with them (I started researching dark matter in all of my family's astronomy books as a result). To me these books mean a lot, and I don't say that lightly. When I first heard that they were making a film I was excited but skeptical (especially given a recent failure of one of my other most beloved series to have been accurately translated to the screen). I became even more doubtful of the film's quality when I read many of the fan's reviews of the film just before going to see it. Although I agree that it could have been longer (the middle of the story, when Lyra is rescued by the Gyptians, seemed particularly rushed), and although it would have made the film that much more wonderful had New Line been brave and left in more of the religious controversy, overall I think this was a promising beginning for the rest of the series. To my mind, if any sequels get made (and I hope that they do), New Line can always make them progressively closer to the source material. In fact, with the way the books ended, it seems impossible that they could gloss over the deeper meaning of the later ones, at least without completely changing the story. The one thing that did bother me was that they cut the real ending, especially since they already had it filmed. When I read that book as a child I was on the absolute edge of my seat waiting to find out what happened, because it had such a climactic ending. Although the movie's ending wasn't nearly as terrible as people made out, it didn't have the spark and intensity that the book had. That said, the movie had quite a few intense moments of its own (towards the end, when Lyra discovered the truth about her parents, etc, for example). Another thing: why do people hate the music so much? To me this seems like people are just trying to bash the movie as much as they can. I can understand the sentiment, but Alexandre Desplat did a wonderful job, and I was absolutely thrilled with Kate Bush's song which, for me, contained all of the atmosphere, intensity, sadness and depth of the novel. Some of the atmosphere and depth was lost with a rushed middle and skipped ending, but Kate Bush's song was full of all of those things. Listening to the soundtrack on its own without the movie really allows you to better appreciate it. Unlike some other recent soundtracks (Stardust's, for example), the music was not intrusive, and did not distract from the film. All in all then, as a fan, I had most of the same issues as everyone else, but to a lesser degree. I think that, despite much of the book's meaning being hidden by New Line, some of it still slipped through when Mrs. Coulter was explaining to Lyra about Dust. How could her words have been taken to mean anything else -but- original sin? To me this just showed that the idea would be explored in more depth in future films which, if I recall, was pretty much the case with the books as well. Now, if only they'd left on that ending! *sigh*",The Golden Compass
414,Fifilafoo,What Compass?,3,30 April 2008,"Fans from a young age have long waited for this to become true; Lyra, Pan, Asriel and Coulter to become physical creatures only to be ruined by a movie not thought out very well and seems to be only testing the new age graphics rather than focusing on the plot.To begin, the Golden Compass is the wrong title on what the book was actually based upon and gives the wrong impression of what the true nature of where the movie intends to go.Performances by the actors and actresses are very well played out with fresh faces on our screens. However a high disappointment for Lyra, played by Dakota Blue Richards, who was seen as a more tomboyish figure in the books and how her character was meant to evolve through the series of events that faced her.Obviously most movies tend to skip parts of books they feel they could change, add and even bring more detail to but it just feels like someone has just skimmed through the book last minute and chose what they thought to be 'juicy' parts.The dark feelings that is suppose to be played out in a lot of scenes were lost in the direction of trying to achieve the same level as a Disney ride that everything turns out bright and happy which especially ruined the ending. This is suppose to be about Lyra growing up and taking part in her big adventure where yes, there is death including a dead child which they felt they has to miss out and I personally believe is a huge part to Lyra's emotions and which could have been a high point for Richard's acting and her to play out that part would have been tremendous.A comment about it being the next 'Lord of The Rings' makes no sense in any perspective. Time was spent on that movie and a director who was willing to take it that step further made it possible. Weitz was aiming too far a head too fast.I was expecting something amazing, something to make me feel 12 again and be mystified and wowed but now I just feel old, wanting to complain of how dreadful the contrast is to the book and the movie. Watch if you haven't read the books, there will be no disappointment but avid fans of His Dark Materials, don't waste your money or time on something you'll regret. Truly I could say more but I will save it for a conversation where I could rant all day and night.Maybe Peter Jackson is up for another big job?",The Golden Compass
415,and-kenobi,Only 1 problem... Too short!,10,6 December 2007,"Almost a year ago, the first photo from The Golden Compass was released. Since then, I've followed the production closely, read all articles, seen all clips and seen all pictures. My expectation, even with the altered ending and the other changes, was sky-high. But the chance of being very disappointed was also big. But oh my god! It was fantastic! I'll start with the bad thing. Cause there were only 1. The movie was simply to short. NLC should have done as they did with LOTR, and made a three hour movie. That would have made room for some more character introducing, some more settling for the audience and the real ending. When the movie was over, I sat there thinking: When did I last see a movie bee over so quick? Almost 2 hours was gone before the movie even had started. So it felt! But that indicates, which leads me to the good things, 2 hours of great entertaining! A lot of talk about the religious elements being removed, all I got to say is, yes, if you haven't read the books, it's hard to spot them. But when you know what the Magisterium really is, it isn't hard to imagine what Lord Asriel means when he talks of a world with no authority, or when Mrs. Coulter talks about our grand grand-fathers who betrayed the Authority and thereby created Dust.... The acting is simply great! When the first pictures were released I was one of those who thought, that Dakota was to 'nice' to be Lyra. Now, I have no doubt that she was the best girl they could have chosen! Nicole Kidman is creepy and slick, and her performance is one of her best ever! Daniel Craig plays a very small part now the ending is gone, but his charisma and attitude is SO Lord Asriel! Sam Elliot and Eva Green also tributes with great performances! All in all, the movie is fantastic! After all, this result is close to perfect, and the things keeping it from LOTR-level is very few, and depending on TGC's success they could easily be fixed in the following movies, so I think fans should be proud of the TGC-team, and turn their anger against NLC! Cause the movie is great!",The Golden Compass
416,imdb-10900,See it!,9,11 December 2007,"We are getting fantasy films by the shovelful this year. This is by far the best fantasy film since The Lord of the Rings. The majority of negative comments are by fans of the books and people that have a vision in there head of what something should be are rarely satisfied. And there is the campaign by certain religious groups that have put out scares that the books are written by an ""atheist""(ooh, booga booga!) and have gotten themselves on television news to tell people not to see it.The film is 2 hours and doesn't have a dull moment. The effects are flawless to the point where you don't think about them and they don't overwhelm the story and characters. I found this story to be a huge contrast to the Chronicles of Narnia. Not because of Narnia's deliberate Christian message but because as a children's film it does not talk down to it's audience. I had a huge problem with The Lion, the Witch, et al. because it has children pick up weapons for the first time in there life and go off to war as skilled warriors and tacticians. There is also something unnatural about the way talking animals were done in Narnia vs. a more natural feel in Compass.The story is about the choice to think for yourself and to stand up and fight for the right to do it. So, see it for yourself and decide.",The Golden Compass
417,jessicalpeter,Enjoyed the world & action; disappointed by the story,5,28 April 2020,"I had just finished reading The Golden Compass for the first time and loved it, so decided to watch the movie. That was maybe a mistake?The interpretation of the world including steampunk visuals and a slightly altered skyline of London were great. Loved seeing the action, the witches, the armoured bears (but where were their flamethrowers?), and Sam Elliott playing, er, Sam Elliott. The actress playing Lyra also fit well.The plot and writing fell flat. The voice over clunkily gives you all the details you learn throughout the entire book. They took out a lot of the details that make the book and its characters take on shades of grey. A lot of the darkness is gone. And the ending was wiped entirely for something totally hopeful.A few changes I'd say were necessary to convert to film, but so many just stripped the story down to a mostly pleasant children's film. It's technically a children's book, but filled with violence, death, darkness, and complexity. I missed that in the movie",The Golden Compass
418,Kaja-2,This was not a nice movie,1,5 December 2007,"This movie might have looked good, but in storytelling it was simply awful. How can you serve your audience a storyline like this one. Boring, incomprehensive and very disappointing. Please release me of this sort of film-making. Even though acting is reasonable and visual effects are lovely. The movie has bad, very bad dialogue, badly found twists and a lot of 'deus ex machina' solutions for patching up bad scriptwriting. I just can't understand: - why does this girl have to through this all? - why does the baddie want her to fail? - what motivates the uncle figure to let this girl go through this all, unprotected?",The Golden Compass
419,jesterchris-2,Not so good on its own,3,14 December 2007,"Honestly, this could have been so much better. I've read reviews from people saying this was ""action packed"". And I ask, ""Is that because you woke up to watch those scenes and then drifted back to sleep?"" The story and plot were very lacking in this movie. It seemed that they spent too much time over-explaining some things instead of letting the audience figure things out. The action sequences were short lived and not very exciting in my opinion.I think all of the actors did great in their roles, especially Sam Elliot, he's the man! The special effects and scenery were excellent and depicted a great looking environment.But my biggest beef is probably with the ending and poor endings always lower my opinion of a movie. It just ends on a very, very low note. It didn't feel like it should have ended right there. They started another part of their journey right at the end and from what I understand and have heard about the book ending, it would have been MUCH better had they used the original ending.Also, I went into the movie knowing nothing about the religious controversy and I really don't feel as though the movie depicted any religion in a bad light... but then again I can separated fantasy from reality. It depicted a corrupt government that was strongly influenced by a religious body of some sort. But you could also say that the scholars depicted another group that wasn't corrupt and was seeking the truth.In closing, I don't think this movie is a stand alone movie. I really felt cheated on the story and ending and I would say that it really needs the other installments to really make this first movie complete.",The Golden Compass
420,richard-kurtz,Good acting and special effects. Poor storytelling,4,4 December 2007,"I have not read the book so I can't comment on how close the movie follows it. However, as a movie, it is so poorly edited to be barely comprehensible. The whole movie seems like every other scene has been cut out. Characters and situations are not explained, relationships are not developed, and the plot is left with gaping holes. Fans of the book will, no doubt, be able to fill in the details. For the rest of us, I would not bother. This is a shame because the acting is good and well-cast. The special effects are equally impressive. If the movie had lasted another hour, it probably would have been terrific. Hopefully, a director's cut will be released some day that redeems this travesty.",The Golden Compass
421,sporti-chic,Brilliant Casting spoilt by weak direction,6,5 January 2008,"Each actor chosen was perfect and completely believable in their roles, with a brilliant supporting cast. The best performances in this film were Nicole Kidman as Mrs Coulter, and Eva Green as Serafina Pekkala. They were born to play these roles, and were exactly as I imagined them (ignoring the facts that both of them have the wrong hair colour, I think that they look perfect, and Philip Pullman has admitted that he was wrong, Coulter has to be blonde.) Dakota Blue Richards captures the essence of Lyra, and lights up the screen whenever she is on it. She does not try to overact, and helps to slow the film down slightly, which is otherwise moving far too fast. However, it is difficult to determine whether she is a brilliant actor or the perfect Lyra, which will be put to the test by the much more difficult emotional scenes in the future films. The switching of directors (Chris Weitz and Anand Tucker) has obviously taken its toll. The bridge scene was used before it was needed, so will be missed in future instalments. The lack of an ending is a huge mistake(even people who haven't read the books has mentioned the rather dead feeling of the end.) Another mistake is that the plot is all explained at the beginning, and all the intrigue created by the book is replaced by slight confusion and a sense of something missing. I soon realised this to be the intelligence of the book. The original meaning has been watered down due to the 'anti organised religion' theme. So, an adults book has now become a children's film, which I have to say is brilliant for what it is. The effects throughout the film are fantastic and create a world that almost feels real. I saw this film twice, and I have to say I was heartily disappointed the first time round. However, I decided to give it a second chance, determinedly ignoring the differences to the book. I found to my surprise that I loved it and would advise all haters of the film and lovers of the book to do the same. It really isn't as bad as it first seemed.",The Golden Compass
422,doraemon_94,"Not a bad movie - in fact, it was quite good.",8,15 January 2008,"Even though, as you might realize, many comments relate to this movie tend to point out a simple conclusion, that it is flopped.However, I went to see this movie anyway. To be very honest, I actually think this movie was not as bad as many people out there describe.The movie did give a huge amount of information in a very short period (1.5 hours) and this can be frustrated. Meanwhile, this movie also presented a high level of entertainment. The scenes were link to each other well enough that you wouldn't get confused. Everything that was necessarily to know in order to understand the story was mentioned clearly. The graphics and acting were also great that there is a very small chance that you would feel like you are watching a kid movie.As a movie, explaining everything in the book is impossible, unless you want to make its length up to 12 hours. Also, as a movie, most importantly is to deliver the excitement to the audiences. The Golden Compass was a bit rush but because of that, you wouldn't feel bored watching this movie, since it doesn't go on and on to explain a background for like 10 minutes. I think the director made a very good adaptation of the original story. This movie is definitely a worth-watching movie for all age of people.",The Golden Compass
423,rki_tki,"Great movie, can't wait for the sequel",10,14 December 2007,"Exceptionally beautiful, well acted, and wonderfully directed this is a masterful piece of storytelling. Those who have read the book will find that the film adaptation lacks some of the depth of the written work, but that is to be expected in any film adaptation of an immense story like The Golden Compass. The ending is very abrupt, and particularly frustrating for those that have read the book, but it leads beautifully into what would be an incredible kick off for the next film. The cgi characters are all exquisite, and so skillfully voiced that it makes your suspension of disbelief a very simple matter. This film is for anyone with an active or questing imagination, I hope that you read this review, go see the movie, and that you enjoy it as much as I did.",The Golden Compass

This is however a very sound kids tale. An extremely enjoyable children's tale. Every scene the story is simply explained by a character (which is why I expect the professional reviewers trashed it). It works for me. I love this film. It is simple, yes but the acting is excellent the costumes are wonderful and the story is one of good and evil where the goodies come out on top because they do the right thing and try hard. I don't want to give away any spoilers but this movie is well worth the time to view. Apparently there was only enough market/cash for the Hobbit to be made so the sequels didn't make it into production. I think this is very unfortunate.

427,Red-Top,Great cast and acting... but thats about it...,2,9 December 2007,"This movie was one of the most painful I have sat through in a long while. Although it had an all-star cast that did a great job, their superb acting skills couldn't have fixed the many, many problems with the rest of the film. First off, it's boring Very boring. I'm no idiot, I can watch movies based purely upon dialog and be enthralled, or action flicks leaving me at the edge of my seat, but this movie had action scenes that left me yawning, and dialog that had me playing with my car keys in my pocket. If you haven't read the books, do not see this! You will be lost wondering what the heck dust is, why there are ""demons"" following everyone, why they want to remove people's demons, and why didn't Daniel Craig have a bigger role! I may just be bitter because two enormously obese women sat next to me and laughed at everything (things that weren't supposed to be funny), a kid in front of me slamming his chair into my knees, and the theater being approximately 750 degrees, but this is one of the worst movie-going experiences I have come across far worse than Hit-man, surprisingly enough. Horrible character development, more holes in the plot than a sieve, over-used CGI, and little to no back-story. If you like to see lots of talking animals and predictable scenes, or have read the books to fill in the gaps left in the movie, by all means see this movie. I also heard a rumor that God died in this movie, which was actually the small bit of info that pushed this movie over the edge of interestingness for me to go see again, only disappointment. 2 out of 10.",The Golden Compass
428,Cescante,A Massacre of All of the Great Things It Could Have Been,2,19 October 2008,"I do not recall when it happened - might have been that bloody messy blob of a film called Reign of Fire in 2002, accompanied with the terrifying, nauseating cheap mush Eragon in 2006  when Hollywood began to murder great actors and our amazing technologies in computer graphics, with terrible screenplays and some horrendous actors.Much to my disappointment, The Golden Compass is one of those cases.The film on the whole felt like the Harry Potter films since the Goblet of Fire  too much storyline jammed in to the two hours, in a terribly rushed manner. Scenes jump from one to another with little transition. Too few things are explained well enough to give any sense of coherent flow. People, items, and location appears out of nowhere, leaving the audiences with a flood of question marks. If the original book was to be filmed soundly in its entirety, one could produce a no worse 2-hour movie by randomly deleting scenes. This is a MESS.However, to be fair to the brilliant people who played roles in the making of this film (at most of them are), the acting and the CG are impeccable. We must make note that compared to Eragon, in which the entire cast was only salvaged by the voice of Rachel Weisz, the cast of The Golden Compass consists of a team of the best actors in our time. From young Dakota Blue Richard to the well respected Ian McKellen; from marvelous Nicole Kidman to the epic casts of Casino Royale  the actors of this film brings to the screen nothing but excellence in portraying their roles. And the CGs and special effects  well it is a 2007 fantasy film, so nothing fell short of the wonders of that in 300 and Transformers.Now on to the original story: I have not read Northern Lights, but have heard great things about it. Indeed based on the individual elements I saw in the film (a parallel universe, humans and demons, magic and ancient relics, epic battles, and love and hate), there is no doubt that it was originally a fascinatingly imaginative piece of literary work. And despite the terrible transitions and vague screenplay, I could somewhat feel the conflicts and plot twists that was the original story.So here is an explanation of my rating: (0 (directing, screen play, everything to do with and how it all came together) + 10 (acting and graphics))/ 2 (average them)  3 (for the great acting that made me sit through the mushy junk) = 2.",The Golden Compass
429,niemax,My great disappointment...,3,16 January 2008,"I really like fantasy movies... So when I saw the trailer of the Golden Compass I knew I had to see this movie... In fact I looked very much forward to it... My expectations were pretty high... There have been some very good fantasy movies the past few years... You know of which I speak: both JRR Tolkien and CS Lewis were very satisfying... I had not read the book of the Golden Compass movie and I think of this as a good thing: the second and third installment of LotR were a bit harder for me to get into, because I had read the books by then...As I said: my expectations were high... Yet, I had to recalibrate them as soon as I read that the director of this movie is the director of American Pie... I just can't say AP is the most qualitative superb movie I've ever seen... Still, I though the Golden Compass could be a nice movie... Not as great as the ones names before, but very much like Potter maybe?Was I ever disappointed! It didn't work for me at all... Both the acting and the story-telling are poor... The story goes from one situation into another without explaining what exactly happens and why it happens: it just happens... Characters pop up and disappear, pop up again... There is one, maybe two characters that have sort of a heart and a soul in the movie... The rest of them are totally flat... (Not a surprise: American Pie...)But to be honest: visually this movie is very good... The CG characters look very convincing and real... And although the landscape isn't as picturesque as are both Narnia and Middle Earth, still it looks nice...Concluding what can I say? I was disappointed... I expected more...

431,djerams,The Fools Golden Compass,5,20 December 2007,"After reading the reviews for this film, I was expecting to hate the film after spending the summer reading the trilogy. The whole atheism thing that many annoying people have been talking about was watered down, and even in the books it was on the side. The film's main problem was that the books were always about the message that was conveyed in Pullman's writing and narrative flow. The narrative was disrupted by the screenwriter trying to keep the film to around 2 hours long, which is not what it deserves.Also because of this the film become unmemorable and slightly boring. This wasn't helped by the fact that in some places it was obvious that Dakota Blue Richards had been through too many takes and her acting was as if she was just reading from the script.Another problem that faces the next film is that it will be too long and the last 4 chapters of the Subtle Knife will have to be cut out so the ending from the Northern Lights will be at the beginning. This choice of playing around with the book was not a good choice by Chris Weitz because a lot of people have read the book and were obviously going to be angered by this 'wishy-washy' version of a great story.What was good about the film? Well the CGI, although very obvious, especially with the bears, was competent and aided the narrative. The professional actors; Sam Elliot, Daniel Craig and Nicole Kidman, lit up what could have been a very poor film and turned it into an OK film that had moments that could go down in cinematic history.The film stands up very well to the other blockbusters currently around, and if you have already seen Enchanted then Golden Compass is the next family film to see this year and will get you through to the next set of blockbusters, chief among which is Will Smith's I Am Legend",The Golden Compass
432,jonduckworth,Cold Product,5,15 December 2007,"I have always been sceptical of the trend (kickstarted by Harry Potter) for adults to read children's fiction. That said, I was aware of the controversy around Pullman's trilogy and, after seeing the trailers, had high expectations for The Golden Compass, so I dutifully took my daughter to see it.Well...I don't know if I left my brain at the office that day, or if I was a little tired, but the first hour or so was so confusing and muddled that it really tested my patience. Set in an alternate reality to our own (a world run by powerful bishop-types where everyone is accompanied by an animal incarnation of their soul linked to them by something called Dust) the film skirted around too much scene-setting. What should have been mysterious and intriguing was just baffling, and came across as bewildering nonsense. (Even by the end of the film, we're no wiser about what Dust actually is...and yet the characters talk about it endlessly).This movie is a real botch job. To keep things short, the action skips from one confusing event to another without much plot logic. Characters are left to speak ridiculous lines of exposition just to help you keep up with what's happening. Unfortunately, not much is happening. People move from place to place (though without the sense of scope and journey of, say, Lord of the Rings), meet people, talk about Dust. Then two polar bears have a scrap (very graphic for a PG - some of the kiddies were traumatised), we learn about a process called ""intercision"" (a sort of castration or circumcision to separate kids from their ""daemon"" animal spirits), it gets suddenly more exciting for 15 minutes, and then it ends. And you haven't learnt much more than when you went in.The whole production lacks the requisite sense of wonder and magic. What you're left with is some inconsistent CGI effects and so much snowbound landscape you'll wish you'd wrapped up warmer.Performance-wise, Kidman looks stunning and delivers a subdued menace. Sam Elliott as a ballooning cowboy has charisma. McKellan gives good voice as an alcoholic polar bear. But a lot of the other actors fail to make an impression thanks to their underwritten parts.Ultimately, this is an entirely underwhelming start to a proposed trilogy. That said, my 9 year old daughter seemed to enjoy it. More fidgety kids and picky adults might not find as much to satisfy them.",The Golden Compass
433,JamesABarcomb,"Great visual effects and cast, but suffers from poor script and confusing plot",6,9 December 2007,"The Golden Compass is a decent fantasy film starring Nicole Kidman, Daniel Craig, and Dakota Blue Richards in her film debut. All three are terrific in this film, most notably Kidman as the deliciously evil Mrs. Coulter (one could almost say that her villainy rivals that of Professor Umbridge in Harry Potter and the Order of the Pheonix). The special effects are also brilliant, especially in the climactic battle scene (eye candy seems to be in this year!). Unfortunately, the film's strengths barely make up for its weaknesses. The screenplay is almost laughably bad (Iorek's speech about war feels clichéd) and the storyline starts to make sense, then goes careening off into different directions. Overall, The Golden Compass features great performances and visual treats, but also feels like a mashed-up version of Narnia, Lord of the Rings, and Harry Potter. Best for those who didn't like the book or never read it.",The Golden Compass

The problem is that they've tried to fit four hours of movie into two hours. Lots of scenes don't make sense. Personal relationships aren't believable, because we don't have enough time to see the characters building those relationships. Lee Scoresby becomes Lyra's friend so quickly you wonder if he's a child molester. There's another scene that should be touching, when Lyra apologizes to Iorek for volunteering him for single combat with the king, but it ends up not being touching, or even believable, because we haven't had a chance to learn to believe in their relationship.",The Golden Compass

That's good, but don't just see the movie and not read the book because you will think all the wrong things.This movie not only poorly captures the true messages of Pullman's first book, it lacks the character/plot development that any form of entertainment should have (movie or book). It's rushed beyond belief so we can be dazzled with CGI and loud noises. It's true that the director may have been taking into account the aspects of atheism and whatnot. However, this is fantasy.Also, the movie-makers seem to hold a very low opinion regarding the general public's intelligence. Which is fine, but I mean to divert from the true book so people will not confuse names and who is exactly good and bad. Each individual should be making those decisions on his own, and not being told by the director himself who is good and bad. And if this movie is targeting children, rather than young adults/teenagers, there is something wrong. The book brings up complex issues and talks of death and life and the bond of the soul and body. I mean not too many kids follow the story, so lets not destroy a movie to target the obviously wrong demographic.But, I guess if you wanted to be dazzled by shiny lights and whatnot, then feel free to waste your money.

How did it improve the story to have Iorek Byrnison (the Ice Bear) exiled for being a coward. He was exiled for killing another bear. Making him a coward makes his character weak. This made him seem as if he has no integrity. But perhaps the biggest problem is they don't include the end of the book!

The actors did a great job with what they had, and what they had is what ruined the movie. The script was rough at best, with randomly thrown together scenes that were leading towards an Aha! moment that never came. The whole movie kept building, and the plot kept thickening. However, in the end we are left with a sub par battle and more questions than when the movie started.It seems as if the sole purpose for this movie was to be the directors vehicle for a sequel, as the end comes at a point in the story which traditionally would be the arc of the plot, however we end up getting rolling credits in place of explanation. If there is one thing that I did actually enjoy in this movie, I will say once again, the animation was superb, the ice bears were magnificent, and the actors were good, but not even those could save this movie. Unless you have the mental capacity of a young child, this film will seem like a huge waste of your time and your dollars once the credits roll, and you as I will end up walking out unfulfilled, and ultimately let down.",The Golden Compass
438,steeptech,Horrible Horrible Let Down. If you have read the book do not see this movie!,1,16 December 2007,"I have never even heard of these books before i saw the preview for this movie a while back. after realizing where the film came from i went out and got my hands on book 1. i was really impressed, the book was fantastic, addictive and entrancing! so naturally after reading the book i was genuinely excited to see the movie. it was so horrible i wanted to walk out halfway through. the only reason i stayed was to see what horrible way they decided to end it. this has to be one of the worst fantasy story transitions in a while. i agree with what another poster said about the acting being good but storytelling bad. its true, the performances were impressive but the characters lacked depth because little background and development. The storytelling was so off, this great story was really butchered. i wont say what happened, or didn't, when but that the audience was given all the right information at the wrong times. instead of attempting to follow the flow and path of the original tons of stuff was jumbled together or completely excluded, things that were necessary for the true appreciation of the world created. i understand its hard to be true to a book when going into film but for this story, a story with this much potential it would be worth going to 2.5 or even 3 hours. whoever produced this really screwed up because here was a chance to make an epic, a series of epic, films. i am not trying to be a party pooper but if you appreciate the book and the story DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE, especially if you live in a big city because it it definitely not worth $11. im really depressed now, New Line Cinema has desecrated this great tale and presented a piece of dumbed down happy family time garbage.",The Golden Compass
439,MovieBuffMatt,A must see for all the family,7,17 December 2007,"I went to see this film this morning, and to be quite honest, it is a job well done. The actors are well prepared and acted brilliantly. We didn't however see a lot of Daniel Craig or Eva Green which was quite a disappointment. The film in its self was well thought of and interprets the book by Philip Pullman. The acting was brilliant and the directing was some what quite amazing. The special effects were quite something to, with the hard, dedicated and costly work of the cast and crew, coming together to make a great movie, a great end to a great year. I am not really into these kind of films but to be quite honest, if they were to make the other two films, I would be willing to go! I would recommend this to everyone.",The Golden Compass
440,coolcrowe,This film lacks a soul.,3,20 December 2007,"Allow me to begin by saying that I am a huge fan of Pullman's books, that I am not religiously involved or biased one way or another, and that that is not what this review is about. I was really looking forward to seeing this film, and I had slightly high expectations, but nothing could have prepared me for this drastic of a let down. This film butchers the story up to a ridiculous extreme. When I go to see a film based on a book that I have read, I mentally prepare myself for a different experience. Words can be interpreted different ways by different people, and of course it must be difficult to fit a novel with hundreds of pages into a two-hour movie. There is no excuse, however, for the drastic butchery Chris Weitz has performed. The text is split up into three separate books. Weitz blew my mind by doing amazing and unnecessary surgery on this - he chopped off the ending half of the last book, and then swapped it with the middle book! Not only does this seriously mar any sense of cohesion or purpose in the storyline, it accomplishes no clear purpose. It is as if the director did this for the sake of making the movie different from the book.Another annoyance is the last second replacement of Nonso Anozie with Ian McKellen as the voice of Iorek Byrnison. Anozie's flat, naturally deep voice fits the character of the bear perfectly. Ian McKellen botches up the role, however, by trying to take every unimportant little scrap he can and deliver it with seeping emotion and humanity, destroying the base and primal character the bear is supposed to possess in the first place. I love Ian McKellen, but this is not his role... he upstages everyone on screen. Iorek is meant to be under-acted.Nicole Kidman, however, is absolutely brilliant as Miss Coulter. True, the scripting in most of her conversations could use work, but she brings a depth to her character that is simply lacking in... well, pretty much every other character on screen. Lord Asriel, played by Daniel Craig, has been flattened down to a doting father figure obsessed with something called Dust (and if you haven't read the books, you're going to be very confused what the fuss about all THAT is). His character in Pullman's work was very complex, as dark and unjust at times as he was brave and ingenious. He has no chance to show any of that here, as he shows up on screen for maybe a total of ten minutes. Maybe.After watching all of this, the final blow was the lack of the climax of the book. Imagine watching Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. Now imagine that we get to the confrontation between Frodo and Boromir, where Boromir is about to take attempt to steal the ring from Frodo. We know what's coming. We're ready for it, sitting on the edge of our seats. And the movie goes off. That's how this felt. And what's worse, it wasn't like they didn't have time to put it in... the movie is only an hour and fifty minutes long! No, they left this out for another reason.It is the same reason that in the film, Iorek Byrnison is exiled because of losing a battle instead of losing control and killing his opponent, as in the book. It is the same reason Billy Costa doesn't die in the film, nor Roger. The reason is simply that The Golden Compass doesn't know whether it wants to tell an accurate story, true to Pullman's writings, or to tell a warm and safe children's bedtime story. We want kids to like Iorek, so we'll change his character. We want them to feel optimistic about it, so we'll let everyone live. Why, I don't see why the don't just get rid of any adversity or conflict whatsoever and end with an ""And they all lived happily ever after"".In wanting to both appeal to readers and refrain from offending casual moviegoers, this film has found itself in a paradox... It offends readers and doesn't appeal to anyone who hasn't read the books. On top of all of that, the film tries to keep Hollywood happy by replacing perfect roles with big names. The result is basically a total sell-out... a desperate effort to please everyone, which affects no one.",The Golden Compass
441,Tara2007,"a lot of little things .. that just makes the story seems ""urghh""",5,1 January 2008,"One of my friend recommended the book to me a while back, but I haven't read it yet. When I saw that the movie came out, I decided to go check it out. I was quite disappointed. I hope the book is not this bad. I find the main girl not very charming at all. Maybe it is because of her role, but a main character is so shallow. She's kind of a selfish brat that seems to be full of herself with the ""I don't like to listen to anybody"". A character like that.. is not really someone I want to root for. In the end, I just thought the movies seems to have a lot of potential. There are a lot of good things, but so many dumb little things that make you go ""urgh"". ****spoiler - what I think of the movie in detailed****The goods: - I really like the concept of the ""daemon"". - Overall designs are nice, and effects are decent. - Mrs. Coulter's motivation was interesting.The things that bothered me: - The main girl. She knows that she's being after, but still go out and do dumb things. They said to keep the compass a secret, but she kept pulling it out. If you are being chased and you are running for life, you would show a little fear right? Seeing her saying ""Can I go on your ship?"" to a stranger, and running away on her own even when the bear said not to do so at the end was too stupid. - Little things like.. how the bear mentioned that his armor is like his life, but would take it off so he can put the girl on his back and take her around. After getting your armor taken away, it seems like he doesn't worry too much about it being taken away again. - How the hell did all those Gyptians show up in the end?

442,richscot-1,Disappointing and confusing,3,3 January 2008,"Being a huge fan of fantasy and science fiction I was looking forward to seeing the Golden Compass. I went with my 10 year old nephew and 15 year old niece and we were each disappointed with the film. It was visually very well put together but the plot lines were confusing, the characters weren't believable nor was their struggle and desperation. Despite this I would have enjoyed a good jaunt but even then the storyline was frustrating and erupted in violent conflict at seemingly inappropriate points. Dakota's acting improved throughout the film and she seems to be a promising young actress. Nicole seemed to be trapped in another film as her character mimicked several she has portrayed before. We left feeling universally unimpressed and not sure we could raise our heads for the next film whilst quite keen to seen the sequel to Eragon and Narnia.",The Golden Compass
443,tiy135,Did you really watch the movie?,10,31 January 2008,"After reading a few hundred of commentaries on the movie, I did become very saddened by so much presence of trivial thinking (of the Pavlovian type) in responses. Why at least 85% of those writing reviews compare the m-o-v-i-e to the b-o-o-k? Are they so infantile that could not appreciate the movie as it is, without the book? Cinema and literature are, by definition, very different kinds of arts, with their laws and technical difficulties as the inherent restraints. It is not possible to compare, say, painting and music, even if both reflect on the same subject and have the same title. Similarly, how is it possible to expect a total correlation between what is r-e-a-d and what is s-h-o-w-n? The movie has its own unique value which in no way contradicts what you have read in the book. And, I would recommend to those who show their dislike of the movie read the book more carefully.Finally, if you dislike a movie, any movie, it is because you merely watching it as a 'paying customer' and not as a creative human being.

444,hdzimmerman,A Very Christian Movie (spurn the appearances),10,30 January 2008,"I am really disappointed with all this nonsense talk like ""this movie is against religion"". Such statements and the likes of them contain a number of strong inflexible biases behind them. And the movie just presents these people to what they really are--- and, as a result, they don't like it (and, of course, write negative reviews on the movie). They should better be making negative reviews of themselves and stick better to their religion...First of all, against WHAT religion? There are many of them: three monotheistic, many agnostic and an innumerable number of others. Observing for many years here, in Jerusalem, peoples of different religious persuasions, I still can't make it out against what religion the movie (and the book series, by the way) really is.Secondly, If somebody assumes that it is against his particular religion, let him (her) better look into what he (she) calls as ""religion"". If he is a power-hungry hypocrite using the religious form and appearance to beat people into submission or to achieve other egoistic goals, then, well, I am sorry. It is not religion at all, it is a pagan cult at its worst. Or a ""Magisterium"", in terms of the movie.Thirdly, you might remember that 2000 year old story of a young man who walked the streets, claimed (and shown) supernatural powers and a very close standing to Almighty. As a result, he was taken by Authorities to Magisterium where the Magistrate pronounced the indictment and washed his hands. Does it remind you of something you've ever heard of before? He also defied the Authorities, and was a bright proponent of the free will...If you still don't remember the name of this young man, then, I am afraid, it's a hopeless case. I wrote this remark for thinking humans, not for automatons from various sorts of magisteriums obsessed with various authorities.Don't blame the mirror for the ugliness of your face.

445,maboowho,Pullman's book has been Crucified,2,9 December 2007,"I must say, I was so excited to see this film after reading the trilogy. If I had been the writer I would have turned over in my grave at what a mess they had made of my book. The only thing I enjoyed was the special effects and some of the visual interpretations, but I was so sad to see how far they missed the mark on the adaptation from book to screen play. They changed so much, for no good reason, that it made it almost unbearable to watch. It made no sense to me why they would have omitted so much and changed so much.They would have had a blockbuster on their hands if they could have stayed true to the book. If you haven't read the book you are missing a wonderful journey. The movie falls short in almost every way, other than the visual and special effects. Perhaps for the next one, if there is one they will find a writer that will give justice to the written word. In the book Ms. Colter had dark almost black eyes, that was one of the smallest changes. Also, if two parents have blue eyes, doesn't it stand to reason that the child would to? I just urge anyone who loves a wonderful story to read the book and not go by what the movie portrays!!! As it has missed it's mark dreadfully.I also don't understand why everyone is so upset about the religious factor as it barely touches on it compared to the third book. What they say is true and the Catholic church has always done things in the name of ""God"" when it was really for men, but as I stated they haven't even touched on that issue. I would be more upset over the fact that the book has been crucified.",The Golden Compass

If felt like they took the storyline of the book and threw it back out at random places. Great way to get tell us all about Dust straight away rather than keeping us guessing, like in the book. The acting was shocking. Fardar Coram - did they pick him up from an Am Dram society?! He was terrible, and Nicole Kidman honestly looked like she had many other places she'd rather be. (Why was she whispering for most of the film?) The combination of the special effects and make up made the fight/battle scene look animated.And where was the ending?

So, I took it upon myself to research the plot prior to viewing the movie; I found this to be extraordinarily helpful during the movie because I was aware of everything that was happening. By the way, while they're not many visual effects in this movie, the few that are present during the film are outstanding (it won the 2007 Academy Award for Best Visual Effects)! As far as acting goes, I thought the cast did an average job. I did find the ending quite odd, seeing as how it set up the basis for more events to later be portrayed in the film and then kind of just cut off to the credits. In my opinion, it wasn't a terrific film, but it was good and I don't think it deserves all the negative reviews and votes that it's getting.",The Golden Compass

Nearly all decisions are either magically made right or are suggested by the mighty compass. But look, there are flashy pictures!It's a set of disjoint pictures, the connections are non-existing or convoluted - every new picture and you wonder - what the ...?

Everything is straight - good is bright and and bad is dark. Is this the brain-dead way we should teach our children?Did the boy feel *anything* other than deep pain after being stripped of his animal?

And it turned out to be so much more than I expected! I've never seen a movie where the characters were exactly how they should be. I've never seen it even close.

Lyra looked the part but sounded completely unnatural with the British accent.The movie was a cut n paste of scenes that made a narrowly thought out semi complete move. oh and the film makers left one of the main plot points out. The church! So this movie was effected by the white lines of political correctness too. Many movies have scenes of violence and even rape. Perish the thought a movie should have an element of truth in it that touches the religious subject area.On the positive side, the special effects and sceneries were good, and every other character bar Lyra was convincing and true to the book.Looks like Hollywood thought they could make a good few dollars on a master piece series like this.

It was ""Hollywoodized."" The darker aspects of the story and some key characters were eliminated or sugar-coated. The book's shocking ending was completely missed, forcing the plot to be reordered so that there was at least some climax. All this led to some of the characters' actions and motivations making little sense. And, while the book certainly mentions the church as a negative undercurrent in the story, the movie gives it and it's members a far greater role as the source of all evil. Curious how the filmmakers chickened out on including the dark parts of the story or other characters, but they had no problem adding darkness and evil to religion when it wasn't really in this first book.All four of us found the acting (and casting) excellent all around, and the visuals impressive.

454,dragonfire438,Iorek Byrnisson is my favorite and he saves the movie,10,13 December 2007,"Friday the 7th December. The weather is horrible. Its raining like crazy in Sweden, in the city i live. There is however two things i have waited for quite long 1 Our local theathre shall open after being closed some weeks (7th December) 2 The movie Golden Compass will premiere at our local cinema.It was with happy steps i entered our local theathre. The reason why it has being closed, was because a major touch up. They have a new super bad-ass stereo system and new comfy chairs.There was already many people in line and the personel at the cinema sold lots of tickets to the show. After some 5 minutes waiting they open the saloon where the movie is going to be shown.I buy some popcorn and soda and is standing in line. There are many kids around and they have already began playing with their golden compass toys. Seems like Iorek is a popular toy.There is a little check up at the doors. They check so you don't bring cameras, video cameras and such in the saloon. I sit down on one of the new chairs and begin to relax. This is a great chair.The usual commercial starts and there is 3 commercials related to the movie. Cool!!!. After some minutes the lights dim. A warning about not pirating the movie shows on the screen. This brings some chuckles from the public.The movie starts. And i feel already this is going to be an amazing movie. The sound system rumbles on and even the music sounds awesome. The movie was about 1h 50 minutes or something but it felt very much shorter.A few times i caught myself thinking about how cool it would be to have a Deamon and what if Iorek was real. He would sure getting many hugs from me, and i think the kids would do the same.When i came out from the theathre it still was raining but i didn't care. The movie was so good i was in very happy mood.There were some things i disliked and some i really liked. I mention them below.SPOILERS BELOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Things i Didn't like 1 The pace: It seemed the filmmaker have rushed the scenes too much at times. The movie feel like skipping a few pages at some places.2 : The scene when they find Billy Costa without his daemon is not as horrific as it should be. People who haven't read the book may not understand how it would be without daemons. Pan has a good reaction to the place, but not Lyra. Sad.3: They cut the end.4: Kate Bush song:Lyra: I really like Kate Bush. I have 5 albums with her that i listen to quite often. In this movie she sing a song that is: Bleeeach!!!!. Most people in my cinema left pretty quickly when the credits started to roll.Things i DID like: 1 Iorek Byrnisson!!!!!: He is one of my favorites from the book and boy, would i cuddle him if i could?. Yeah, i should think so. He's so way cool and when he roared some kids almost cried in the cinema. The volume was very very high, but i like that. Also i love his line ""That was all"". Another line i absolutely loved was ""You wish to ride ME?"" My answer would be. Yes, Iorek, we ALL wish to ride you 2: The Bear fight: Oboy, now we are talking about big bears and fighting. Only bad thing with this scene is that is only about 5 minuter. Anyway, Iorek was bad-ass cool and the people in my theather cheered and clapped their hands when he killed Ragnar. That is not very common here in Sweden with people clapping at the cinema.3: Lyra: Oh yes. Dakota did a really great job there, expect from the Billy Costa scene. She is really believable in the other scenes and i think people see here as the ""real"" Lyra.4: The Deamons:Really great done and believable. Who wouldn't wanna have one with their side?. Pan is so very cool and the effects when he's changing into different shapes are awesome. Lol, funny scene with Steelmaria with Pan in her mouth. I laughed some at that.In the end: A nice theather experience. Now i have to talk a friend going to the movie instead of him torrent it and therefore destroying a cool experience.",The Golden Compass

Well, this Christmas, my hopes were realised.Having now seen 'The Golden Compass', or 'Northern Lights' as I knew it from the book, I can happily say that I wasn't the least bit disappointed. Yes, some things have changed and yes, some things are left out entirely. But it mattered not. The characters were there, much as I'd imagined them as I read the book, the scenery was spot on and the daemons were brought to life beautifully. What really made this film stand out, however, was the way it made me remember exactly how I'd felt when I was reading the book.

There was no character development, no explanation of anything in their world, jaggedly cut together scenes, and a plot that makes me wish that someone would invent the atomic bomb and just finish it all. If this movie were an hour longer, it might have been salvageable, but due to the fact that they cut the movie into a 2 hour time slot, I didn't feel anything for any of the characters. For the first twenty minutes or so, I was content with being confused (I have never read the books) because I thought that once the girl gets to a point in the plot where she can sit and talk with someone, they would explain everything.

But even among a group of good friends, there's still the 'odd man out'. I love Fantasy, Sci-Fi, Horror and Action films (the weirder the better), but I found TGC to be too weird, even for my taste. The characters were too wooden, and even in an alternate reality, I have a hard time of someone's totem being referred to 'demon' following them around (the word, 'demon' doesn't bother me, but it just seemed way out of place.) And it wasn't until the very end that they revealed what the villain(s) were up to: They were going to take over all alternate realities. I had to sit through a 3 hour movie (that felt like 5) for the antagonist's motive?? Only then did I get interested. The only surprise I got was that it was nice to see Claire Higgins again, long absent from mainstream films since her portrayal of Julia from Hellraiser I and II. I purposely didn't mark the 'contain's spoiler' box because the film was already spoiled. I just didn't feel connected to the characters to sit through the drudgery. I did enjoy the fantastic ensemble cast, but felt their talents wasted. The look of the alternate reality where the story was set was cool, but that wasn't enough to keep my interest.If there is to be a 2nd or 3rd sequel, They need to make the characters more interesting and not have so many long boring gaps in between important parts. I saw the film only once, and that's fine with me.On a scale of 5 stars (5 being 'Citizen Kane' and 1 'Plan 9 From Outer Space' material), I give it 2.",The Golden Compass
461,whitedogandharriet,A new classic,10,10 December 2007,"I was distracted by life drama when I saw the film last night, but loved it. Many many images have stayed with me. It was chock a block- always tough to film a novel. It's energy is so robust, I liked the fast pace, never expect to grasp every detail in any movie first time through. It's so well cast and scripted. The art direction is tremendous, technically so so great, I forgive it its trespasses, and predict it will become a classic. I loved Sam Elliot's humorous face and the young girl, wow, and all the cast members. I'm a big Daniel Craig fan, to ""pair"" him and Nicole Kidman was genius. Loved the Gypians and the Daemons. The concepts are intriguing...like us, spirituality-the existence of other dimensions is so scary for most, only the truly courageous can get into it. Want to read the books now. Hope they're filming the sequels as we speak, God forbid they have to replace anybody!",The Golden Compass
462,aryl_shanti,Great Visuals and Wonderful Acting,9,7 December 2007,"This movie version of Phillip Pullman's The Golden Compass was a beautiful sight to see. The visuals (sets, costumes, CGI) were amazing and the acting from all the leads was top notch - especially Dakota Blue Richards, who plays Lyra. I loved how the daemons were so real with great facial expressions. This may not be a perfect adaptation but it was quite an enjoyable film. If you've never read the books, you won't be disappointed in the slightest. And if you have, you'll gripe about the ending being cut short and the elimination of any reference to the church, but you'll still find yourself enjoying every moment. I can only hope that they do the two books that come afterward. Overall, I thought this was a hugely entertaining film and way more thought provoking than any other ""children's movie"" out there.",The Golden Compass
463,Kummando,Boring and dull...,4,28 December 2007,"After reading a few reviews over the internet I entered the theater with the feeling I wasn't going to like this movie. I was right on the target.The Golden compass fails in almost everything a good fantasy movie should do. Starting with how the story is presented to the viewer; maybe for a question of time the story is badly explained and there are a few loose ends that have no explanation, things dropping from the sky directly to the mouth of the characters, which lead me to my next argument, the dialogs. The dialogs in this movie are absolutely idiotic, some lines are dropped without any sense others are just stupid leaving the movie in very incoherent state.The acting is mediocre to say the least, not even Nicole and Daniel can save this movie from mediocrity, and even they have mediocre roles with a dull acting. The Dakota, the main character, is annoying and clearly is lost in the movie.Chris Weitz should really be on drugs when he was shooting this movie, really... the way the cameras moves, the angles... everything just makes this film even worst.I guess in the end the film has some good things, the special effects are good, so is the music and the wardrobe.Something I cannot forgive is the total absence of blood in the movie. I'm not some kind of blood drunk freak, but when I watch the discovery channel if two polar bears are fighting there's a lot of blood. And guess what bullet and arrow wounds also make you bleed. Things don't stop being violent because there's no blood, war is something brutal and violent, removing the blood just gives that sense of fakeness to the movie.In the end I would say this is a good movie to rent in rainy day to watch home with a family. It's not a great fantasy movie, you will probably like if you have 10 years old or liked Narnia. Otherwise save your money and go watch something else.",The Golden Compass
464,matthewfahey,The true climax is floating in the ether ::minor spoiler::,7,1 December 2007,"I just saw the preview and I am astonished. It seemed like they were doing it right! As a big fan of the books, I was thoroughly enjoying this film. I was in the middle of anticipating the climactic scenes, when suddenly the music swelled and dissolved into the credits. I felt like I had been ""sucker-punched"".The entire climactic scene involving Lord Asriel, Mrs. Coulter, Lyra and most importantly Roger (not to mention the city in the sky) is missing. I hope they will put it in the next movie, although they seem to be waiting to see promising box office returns before deciding on the sequels so who knows if we will ever see it on the screen. Even if the next film is made, the events at the end of ""The Golden Compass"" belong in the eponymous film.In fact, from a storytelling perspective, the film ended on a section of the book that was more than anything only about exposition. The film's abrupt ending is 'shoe-horned' into a false closure by a short, substance-less monologue from Lyra.I am still holding out hope that the version I saw was a ""test"" version designed to compare audience response with the FULL version of the film. Therefore I will not discuss the details of the missing climax. Suffice it to say that the events at the end of the book are PIVOTAL to the development of Lyra as a character.It is also pivotal for the journey of the audience. How can we (the audience) invest emotionally in this character, indeed, enough to create demand for the sequels, if we aren't allowed to share in the part of Lyra's journey that involves suffering? They were dead-on true to the violence of the bear fights. So why coddle the audience by removing the ending of the story? The argument that mortality is taboo for a holiday audience is an intellectually bankrupt one.To assemble such tremendous talent in the telling of such a wonderful story only to decimate the thing at the end seems a most horrible waste.",The Golden Compass
465,platinum_mongoose,"Fantastic, true to the book, and the Christians should see it before they judge.",10,1 December 2007,"Very, very light spoilers.I just got back from an advance screening. Here's my take: The first thing that needs to be said is that yes, this movie features the church as the ""bad guy."" Sorta. It's an alternate-world church. It's fictional. I'll say that again. It's fictional. In fact, I think it's an excellent allegory for what religion in our world should not be, which is basically a totalitarian state. Also, the ""anti-religion"" message is much stronger in the books than the movie. Judge them each on their own.That being said, on to my thoughts about the movie as a fan of the books.The casting was perfect. Nicole Kidman is amazing as Mrs. Coulter, and Ian McKellen is the perfect voice for Iorek. And I was pleasantly surprised with newcomer Dakota Blue Richards. She has a promising career ahead of her. But stealing the show, in my opinion, was Sam Elliot as the rugged Texan aeronaut Lee Scoresby. My favorite character from the books (from any book, even) came to life on the screen, and I couldn't be more thrilled. I can't wait for Subtle Knife if it gets made, as Lee features more prominently in it.This film is a real treat for the eyes, as well. Stunning visuals, and great CGI. The bear fight was the tour de force in that department, but I also loved the snowy landscapes and the great alternate-history technology. Steampunk, anyone? And as for the bear fight, I was glad they didn't shy away from the, uh... without spoiling anything... let's just call it ""finale."" Everyone in the audience clapped at that one, by the way.Aside from a bit of plot-shifting to ease the transition from book to movie, there were no major departures from the book. The end was the only departure that anyone might get up in arms about, and it was only done the way it was to make the film it's own story if there won't be a sequel. The book ends on a cliffhanger, so they truncated it to end on more of an ""up"" note. But I have no problem with simply starting the second movie with the end of the first.Good film. Fun for all ages. Go see it. They're waiting on box office returns to greenlight The Subtle Knife, which is a far better story worthy of a film. And if Subtle Knife is made to the same standards as Golden Compass, I will be first in line to see it.",The Golden Compass
466,dragonwings628,Mediocre but true to the book,5,1 December 2007,"To begin, I'm not a radical fan of the books. I can't quote specific lines and cite the page numbers, and I can't even remember Mrs. Coulter's first name. But, I did enjoy the books very much and reread them several times. I'm not the type of fan who would freak out at the fact they change Iofur's name, and I would rather have a good but somewhat unfaithful movie than a lousy and literal one. This movie falls into the ""lousy and literal"" category, comparable to the first 2 Harry Potter movies. I'll start with the good. The acting is all-around good; even the kids don't suck. Nicole Kidman especially has the chops to play Mrs. Coulter, I would love to see her as non-diluted evil. Daniel Craig is very good with very little to do. The special effects are fairly pretty, and some of the action is good, if nothing special. A lot of the flaws come from the lazy writing, as the dialogue consists of almost nothing but characters explaining things to each other. There is, of course, a need to explain the mythology, but no reason every interaction Lyra has with a character should directly, and un- subtly, advance the plot. There is very little character development, since each conversation seems to be cut down to the bare bones. This especially hurts the secondary characters, like Lee, Iorek and Serafina, who are given no legitimate reason to be in the story other than periodically rescuing Lyra. The film seems almost phoned-in, by people who knew it would make money off of fans of the book no matter what they did. Of course, any mention of the church is absent. It isn't an enormous problem until Nicole Kidman tries to tell the story of Adam and eve in tales so vague as to be laughable. I couldn't help but wonder what possible resemblance the movie sequels will have to the book ones, as a war against heaven, gay angels, ending the afterlife, and killing god are probably too taboo to be featured.The movie manages to faithfully recreate some of the best scenes from the book (the boy without his daemon, lyra and pan's attempted intercision), but sucks all the drama and excitement from them in the process. Perhaps the producers tuned the emotional intensity down out of fear of scaring away younger viewers, but that doesn't seem to be the case as the film already has a PG-13 rating. Even things that could easily be emotional, like Lyra finding out about her parents, are hindered by lame writing.And the ending. It's sure to be controversial, but I can understand why it was done. The entire last chapter (Asriel, Mrs. Coulter, and Roger) is left out for the next movie. This would bother me less if the film didn't end on such an inorganic note (Roger and Lyra promising to go on adventures?!?) , and if I had more faith that a sequel will even get made. All in all, it's not the worst film ever made, but it seems to miss most everything that made the books great, and any sequels that follow will probably be unrecognizably neutered.",The Golden Compass
467,Preraphaelite-1,Why does this wonderful film have such a low score?,9,10 March 2008,"I read the book and adored it- so was very excited (and worried) to see that a film was being made. For once, a film enhanced the book. I have a few quibbles with the some of the scenes edited out- but, really, thought the movie was awesome. Dakota Blue was perfect as Lyra, everyone in the cast fleshed out my idea of what the character would look like. (Especially Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig- the cameo of Christopher Lee was great). The Oscar for special effects was totally deserved- the world they created was beautiful and magical. As far as the outcry about anti-Christian, anti-religion, whatever- get a life.

It does tend to bog the viewer down with a lot of information early on (which confused some of my party) but I feel the pace was engaging. Well-cast, well-acted and the effects were splendid (especially the choreography in scenes involving several characters and their daemons).My main complaints were that some of the characters were played a little ""lighter"" than their book counterparts (e.g. Lord Azrael); and that the film entirely skipped the ending of the book, probably to provide American audiences with a more suitable, ""happier"" ending, I presume. I'd be happy to view it again.",The Golden Compass

I spent all day reading the book (which is fantastic) and went at night to see the movie only to be let down, not only because of the poor story telling and awkward breaks in the movie and very poor character development, but also because this movie was everything the book was not. The book did not try to push the religious metaphor as much as the movie did, the book flowed very fluidly and told a much deeper story. Since the movie did not have the time to do this, it just decided to change the very heart of the story. Oh and was anyone else completely annoyed with the stupid compass golden dust effects and very disappointed with the action sequences. Nicole K. did all she could, but could not save this movie and the little girl I am so sorry to say was a very very bad actress along with her little friends.

I would have to say there is no religious references (of course anything can be made out to be religious if you try hard enough).

Anyone who has read Northern Lights/The Golden Compass will find this adaptation to be a minimalistic rewritten version of the actual story. Serious plot changes can be noticed throughout as well as an abridged ending. In short, I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, whether they've read the book or not. This movie will only make me do two things: 1) Write my own screenplay to develop into a good movie in the future and 2) Kill Chris Weitz...after seeing this movie I'm struggling to believe he even read the novel. The directing was terrible, the dialogue was terrible, the only two aspects that weren't completely depressing were the acting and some of the visual effects were good, but that of course can't make a movie.",The Golden Compass

The movie moves a little to fast for comfort(I wish it was longer). They do explain most things, but don't get frustrated if you don't get everything. I think they were doing their best not to fall into the first movie trap that Potter and Narnia fell into (both first movies were slow and tedious because they spent too much time explaining things). I have a feeling a lot more will be explained and tied together in the next movie(if there is a next).If you do miss some of the plot then just enjoy the fantastic casting and effects.",The Golden Compass

475,Deckard-OA5599,Golden Compass falls short of expectations,6,10 December 2007,"Just to begin, I have not read the books and am judging solely on the cinematic aspect of this film. I was very much looking forward to seeing this movie, the trailer had me intrigued from the start. I am one of Lord of the Rings biggest fans and was looking for another outstanding adventure from New Line. But i didn't get one.The movie started out well enough. Introducing the characters and setting up the plot. But it really takes a while it seems before anything exciting happens. It isn't until much later that some action breaks out and even then, it is very brief. I wasn't blown away with Dakota Blue Richards performance as Lyra (it wasn't bad just not impressive). The supporting cast of Nicole Kidman, Daniel Craig, Eva Green, and (my favorite) Sam Elliot all gave really good performances.I was pleased to find that even though i hadn't read the books, the story was easy enough to follow even if some of the characters names went over my head. And also the visual aspect was very good. I found it hard to believe that this movie had earned a PG-13 rating. I thought it could easily have been a PG except for one moment during an ice bear fight. Overall though I did not think that it lived up to all of the hype. It was very slow to begin with and there were a couple of transitions between scenes where i felt there was a scene missing. I value great writing/acting just as much if not more than great action. I felt that this movie fell short in both categories. The movie lacked character development and climatic action. It felt as though it could have easily been a half hour longer (if not more); where they could have spent more time on the supporting roles and throw in some action. It will be interesting to see if the sequel will learn from this installment's mistakes.",The Golden Compass

478,jproctor-3,No threat to religion.,7,21 December 2007,"I haven't read the books, so I had no idea what to expect from ""The Golden Compass"". I found it to be an entertaining film for all ages (I'm 56, by the way). It is similar in style to ""The Chronicles of Narnia"", including the setting of a parallel world. Whether a person likes this film or not is strictly a matter of taste, so any merits or detriments I detail here would be in the eye of the beholder.However, I would like to address the comments about the film concerning religion. I am a born-again Christian, well-versed in Scripture, and I will match my faith with anyone. And I don't see where anything in or about this film threatens my beliefs. The war being waged in the story is over free will. The government of the parallel world wants to control everybody, and a group of inhabitants rebels against that. While the Magisterium can certainly be compared to, say, the 15th-century church which wanted to forbid Columbus' voyages, I don't see the rebellion as being the forces of Satan vs God. On the contrary, that church - or, for another example, the church of the Crusades - did more harm to Christianity than good.I am recommending this film to everybody, even children. There are action scenes, but the violence is bloodless (the most shocking scene is the end of the bear fight). The bad people are bad, the good people are good. By no means the best movie ever made, but if you go to the movies to be entertained, this one fills the bill. Those who refuse to see it on religious grounds are missing a wonderful fantasy.",The Golden Compass

I haven't read the book nor do I have any idea what the fuss is all about up until I read an article depicting the trilogy. I was, if not, quite intrigue...similar to the day I've finished reading the Dan Brown novels. There are too many insignificant scenes, and the scenes that I thought IS important was left hanging.

481,rtubbs,A children's film that makes you think...,9,7 December 2007,"I don't quite understand why some people have called for a boycott of this film. The lead character in the film is Lyra (played by Dakota Blue Richards), a young orphan girl living in a college at Oxford University. The film is set in an alternative universe, where Britain is controlled by an extremist religious group called the Magisterium, and where cities like Oxford and London have no modern buildings. One of the few parallels with real-life is seen early on, when members of the religious Magisterium are prevented from taking action within the University (historically, Oxford and Cambridge acted as safe-havens for both catholics and protestants during various religious ""purges"", such as the anti-catholic ""dissolution of the monasteries"" in the 16th Century). The Golden Compass brings up issues of religious extremism, something unusual for a children's film. Head of the Anglican church, Dr. Rowan Williams, has even proposed that ""His Dark Materials"" (on which the film is based) be taught as part of religious education in schools. It is clear later in the film that the Magisterium is about as far removed from Christianity as can be imaged (more Taleban-esquire in their views of original sin). This is clearly intended to make children think. Like most fairy tales, The Golden Compass contains witches and mythical creatures, but centuries of experience have shown that children are able to clearly distinguish between fairy tales and reality, so I cannot see this as a big worry.",The Golden Compass
482,shawnlancaster,Don't Watch if You've Read It,1,10 December 2007,"I will say this plainly and simply: Do not watch this movie if you've already read and loved the book. While the screen writers in Hollywood made some attempt to stick to the BASIC PREMISE, the overall story seems like it was put through a meat grinder then glued back together by a gorilla. The order of events is all wrong (Svalbard BEFORE Bolvangar?), the ending was completely taken out for some unknown reason, facts from The Subtle Knife were revealed in the opening (such as people in other worlds having their soul inside them instead of as a daemon, or Lyra's Alethiometer being last), and even poor Iorek Byrnison is given Hollywood treatment. His noble back story is ripped out, stating that rather than killing a bear who wouldn't back down, he was defeated. What happened to the unstoppable heir to the armored bears' throne? Not to mention there was no ""Iofur Raknison"", the character was renamed...Raknas, I think it was. And his back story was changed to. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. The whole movie was just plain wrong.That being said, it had some merits as a movie on its own. It was pretty, it was fast paced, it was exciting...the story didn't make any sense for the most part except to those of us who had read the book ahead of time, but I suppose it didn't matter much. Overall it was PROBABLY enjoyable to children and adults alike who haven't read it. And so I will say again, don't see it if you've read it, and if you haven't read it, then do whatever you want, but don't read the book if you see the movie first because after seeing the movie you'll probably never be able to truly respect its greatness.",The Golden Compass
483,Enas1,Terrible,1,12 September 2008,"Nothing more than this 1 word is needed when you try to compare it to the book: Just terrible.

I know kids that read the books and some of them understood more things than i did. It mustn't have any violence? Kids don't see, don't leave in violence every day? Isn't Peter Pan a violent book? And no, violence isn't about showing bodies bled like they have an internal amazon. All the phylosophical depth and all the opinions about church has been removed and without all these the film is just another fantasy story. I wonder what they are going to do at the other 2 films (i hope they don't make them) where all these phylosophical opinions are bound to the plot. But to make things even worse the plot has been simplified and parts than added depth to the characters have been removed. Even the visual effects were nothing particular. I have seen lots of stupid films that had astonishing visual effects and sound that they save the film from garbage. This doesn't happen in this film. Soundtrack? I can't remember a single note. The actors were doing their best with the flat and simple screenplay they had. New line cinema tried to use their fame from LOTR. I don't know why since they didn't want or they were afraid to put all the philosophical depth in the film they bothered making it? On a final note , don't watch the film read the book.

Sadly though with it's clunky dialogue, wasted talent, lack of coherence and complete absence of feeling i did not set my sights low enough. Even if i were not a fan of the books i would find it hard to take anything away from this film. Most of the events that take place in the book do seemed to have been mashed into the final feature however they are unrecognisable and leave the viewer feeling cold and indifferent. A word of caution for fans of the book, the ending seems to have gone walk abouts. obviously it was someones toilet break when they were supposed to be editing it together. It is hard to comprehend how such rich source material has been robbed of all its heart. the main problem is not the cast who are reduced to nothing more than the odd cameo. Richards who plays the lead shows potential, however the best actress on earth would find it hard to make this script seem convincing. The dialogue is about as compelling as sticking an electric eel in your underpants. in fact if someone suggests going to see this film point them in the direction of the nearest fish monger instead. it would probably be more fun. truly i don't believe anyone who worked on this film has has ever read a book let alone the one they adapted.

(3)Unnecessary changes to events in the movie like, which boy lost his daemon, who tries to poison Lord Asriel, the witches test to see if Lyra is the girl from the prophecy, how the Gobblers kidnap children and the escape from Svalbad. (4)The armored bear fight was boring and tame. There could have been some bruises shown on the bears. I'm not asking for blood pouring out but these are bears clawing at each other. (5)Too many missing scenes from the plot like Ms Coulters party in the book where Lyra 1st sees Lord Boriel. (6) Lyra is not supposed to know she's important but in the movie the witch tells her instantly!!!!! (7)What happened to the last 2 chapters from the book? The movie ended in a lackluster way that doesn't make you want to see a sequel. (8) they never quite give you the feeling of how important a daemon is to its human. Thats its their soul and whatever they feel the human feels and vice verse. (9)Why does Lyra know what dust and intercission is? Why is she jumping on the backs of soldiers during the last fight? she's a little girl who ran in the books during the fight.Forget the special effects because its nothing you haven't seen already if you watched any of the Lord Of The Rings, King Kong, Jurassaic Park or recent Star Wars films.",The Golden Compass
489,vyxxen13,So much less than I hoped for,4,9 December 2007,"I was, on the whole, disappointed. It was a visual treat, don't get me wrong. The cinematography and CGI were wonderful, but that was the whole of the movie, as far as I was concerned. The film itself was choppy, and I could tell there was so much lacking of the original story. It would have been better if they'd made it 20-30 minutes longer, so they could include more detail, but as it was it was hard to follow, and there was very little to make the characters compelling. So much more detail was needed to flesh the story out, and now I feel I did myself a disservice by not reading the books first, because then I might have enjoyed the film more, as I would have been more capable of filling in the blanks they left.The cast is first-rate, I'll give them that, but they had so little to work with. No character motivation for the majority of the cast, and even the huge revelations fell flat because there was no framework of the whole in which to fill it in. And the only memorable bit of the soundtrack was my wincing over the horribleness of the ""Lyra"" song at the closing credits.So aside from the ooh-ing and aah-ing over the airships and carriage and a general lust over Nicole Kidman's wardrobe, it wasn't a satisfying experience.",The Golden Compass

I was really shocked at just how much of the spirit of the book had gone. So much of the important, subtle storyline is simply ignored. You don't get to see the characters as fully-rounded individuals at all, what was a masterpiece has been turned into a run-of-the-mill Hollywood fairytale. I expected to be a little disappointed but this was way beyond this. If I weren't with friends I would have almost certainly walked out within half an hour. To me Northern Lights was never simply a kids book, but the film certainly is only for kids. Lyra is nowhere near as brash or aloof as she should be, and neither is Asriel. Farder Coram is not a frail old man, and the Gyptians do not get the role they should - there is no Roping, no discussion and even the Gobblers are little more than mentioned. Iofur's name is changed, the whole situation with the bears is not explained, and Iorek himself does not convince the watcher of his status. It is all totally watered down and made completely obvious. Ugh.",The Golden Compass
492,WildBear,I thoroughly enjoyed it; would like to see the story continued,8,16 December 2013,"Others have noted that the story moves fast and parts of the original story were left out, and they're correct. It does move forward fast and would have benefited if more time were allowed for story and character development. Despite this shortcoming, I enjoyed this movie more than any other movie I've seen in the past 30 years. (The last movie I enjoyed this much was The Secret of NIMH, an exceptionally well made animated movie released in 1982.) The Golden Compass seemed a big step in the right direction from my perspective. The production qualities were superb. The story was kept on a serious level throughout; no nonsensical Disney-style comedy spoiled it for me, as has been the case with most other movies in similar genres that I've seen over the past few decades. The animal/daemon characters were very well done, and I was very pleased and entertained by them. There are other aspects in which I regard this movie as superior, but I won't go into all of them here.The only real shortcoming, is that it left the story hanging at the end, with a very obvious need for continuation. I've been on the edge of my seat waiting and watching anxiously (probably in futility) for news of a sequel ever since I saw it about a month ago. This is one movie for which I really, really want to see it continue! I want to see how the story proceeds, and I would like to see the same masterful cast and crew continue it. I really hope that I won't have to wait another 30 years to see another movie that I enjoy as much as I enjoyed The Golden Compass.I'm rating it 8 out of 10; the markdown from 10 only because it would have benefited from more time spent for story and character development. I've read that parts of the story were left out in response to pressure from religious types. (I don't know whether or not this is true.) If it is, I would urge the makers, in the future, don't cave in to such pressure. Do what's right for the story. And please, get busy and make that sequel.

493,delicateharmony,All the makings of a classic with to much left on the editing room floor...,6,25 November 2008,"The Golden Compass should (but probably won't) go down in movie history as one of the truly great tragedies in film. What could have been a brilliant film, and a truly great film franchise rivaling Harry Potter and The Lord of the Rings, is crippled by choppy story telling and a truncated story.All the elements of a great film are there: A great cast, excellent acting, solid direction, and very good special effects are all there. What one wonders after watching the film, is just what ended up on the cutting room floor. With a running length of 113 minutes, there was certainly plenty of time to fill in the gaps that would leave the average movie goer perplexed by the various plot elements and character interactions. And probably enough time to provide a more satisfying conclusion, rather than leaving us wondering what happens next.Sadly, we're not likely to see what happens, as a sequel seems highly improbable at this point. Me, I guess I'm going to end up going out and buying Philip Pullman's 'His Dark Materials' trilogy to get the answers to all the questions the film has left me with.All things said and done, and despite a desperate desire to give the movie a higher rating, in good conscience, I have to give The Golden Compass 6 out of 10 stars.",The Golden Compass
494,sporkboy-1,Worst Book to Movie Ever,2,7 December 2007,"This movie is a travesty.I only gave an additional point for Dakota Blue Richards' outstanding portrayal of Lyra, since the other actors, though well-cast, had nothing to work with and no character development. This was a shame, since Lee Scorsby and John Faa are such rich characters. A few, such as Serafina Pekkala, served as heavy-handed exposition and nothing else. The script was atrocious. Too much information packed into too short a time. To understand anything you had to take notes and cross your fingers. Despite a few similar scene concepts this film follows nothing of the book or the sub-text contained within, and changes what is at the heart of the tale. A two dimensional, bland rendering of what was a lush and vivid universe. Save yourself the time and money and read the book again.",The Golden Compass
495,simonrommedahl,A disappointment,5,8 December 2007,"I saw it just 2 hours ago... And I was really disappointed. I have read the books more than one time, and I couldn't help but wonder why some characters said other characters lines. For example why is it Mrs. Coulter whom tells Lyra about her heritage. In the books its Lord Faa. And why, why did they let Chris Weitz direct this movie? I give him, he did a great job in about a boy, but this is a complete different genre. I know ""you have to start somewhere"" but couldn't he have started somewhere else than in a 200 million dollar production. Back to the film. Dakota Blue Richards had some good and some good moments. She starts out great, but her credibility fails in the scene with the argument with Mrs. Coulter. Daniel Craig was, in my opinion, great, but that doesn't help the film as he is only in the film for less than 2 minutes. Nicole Kidman made an honest job of it, and Sam Elliot was great. The Special Effects were great, except for the scene where Lyra rides Iorek. Overall a really disappointing film, especially if you've read the books. I think the biggest mistake of the film is the choice of director. Not because he's bad, but because he's inexperienced. The story never really catches you, and you're basically just waiting for the end, which is another disappointment as it ends the wrong place. It's sad to see a movie with such potential made so sloppy. Re-shoot it with another director, and make it longer. It doesn't matter if it has a runtime of 3 hours. They did it with The Lord Of The Rings and it worked. If I were you I'd watch Stardust instead. That, my friends, is a masterpiece.",The Golden Compass

But what a disappointment! I know people always say that the book is better, whenever there is a film adaptation, but in this case it is startlingly true. All of the subtleties of Pullman's storytelling have been butchered by this film. They reveal far too much in the prologue, and it completely ruins the magic of the story. Part of the fun of the books, was the discovery of new information, and piecing together the puzzle as to what was really going on, and this film just ruins this by blurting it all out at the beginning. This film felt shallow, and had none of the atmosphere I would have expected. I loved the books, and this is why I am so frustrated by this film, and i just hope people don't use this to judge Pullman's writing.

And after hearing so much negative and positive about the movie I wasn't sure what to expect, but I ended up liking it. A lot. The best thing I recommend for those who have read the book is to remember that books and movies are two different mediums and what works well with one may not work well with the other. Essentially, don't go in to nitpick the tiny details. There will be changes and you'll probably enjoy it more if you don't. Overall I thought the movie was really good.I thought the actors all did a wonderful job and Dakota Blue Richards and Sam Elliot were wonderful in their parts. The special effects were wonderful, I especially loved when people's daemons disappeared. The only big complaint I had was every now and then the soundtrack music got a bit distracting and annoying but for the most part I thought it worked as well.I will warn though, that I think some people may be a bit let down by the ending, especially for those who have read the books. But since they are not omitting it completely and just moving it to the beginning of the next movie I don't see it being such a big deal. I also think some, especially those who haven't read the books may feel a bit let down at the end, but for me it felt more like it was building up towards the next two movies (if made) and I left the theater already wanting to see the next one.",The Golden Compass

The ending completely ruined the movie for any readers. The last three chapters were completely cut from the movie, leaving you hanging with a half-fulfilled feeling. I was so awe-struck I stayed until after the credits searching for some continuation, some closure.For some reason, I find that all of its redeeming qualities don't make-up for the fact that the ending was cut.

The child Tony Markos whose daemon was cut away, they replace with Billy Costas, whom Lyra saved in the book. Ratter was never the name of Billy Costas daemon. They cut out the beginning part where Roger and Lyra went into the tombs of the past scholars, and then cut out the part where she carved the coin for Tony Markos in the tradition of the scholars. (By the way, if she had gone to svalbard first, the entire legion of bears would have followed their king Iorek into battle at Bolvangar.) The movie is out of order, and just doesn't make sense in most ways, not to mention that at the end of the book, Lyra goes and see's her father, who then takes Roger as a sacrifice and kills him.

503,DukeDoom,Suffers from a complete butchering of the story,3,3 January 2008,"As I have heard this movie will be coming to theaters soon I went and read the book. I was absolutely entranced, the book's story is simply captivating from beginning to end and in advance I thought along the lines of ""this can't be less than two and a half-three hours"". And it was, which was completely terrible. In this regard I have to separate movies based on film into two categories, according to how true they remain to the source. In the good category are the Harry Potter movies, especially the 3rd and 4th, and The Princess Bride, which both stayed almost completely within the lines of the plot of the book, and only expanded upon it and represented parts of it. Of course, there were deviations, but they were all quite acceptable and mostly very small. On the other hand, there are the bad ones, namely, this movie and the recent Stardust, which took the basic premise of the book's plot and it's major characters and then decided to butcher it all around in order to make it into a shorter film which would seem more ""right"" for a movie. In this case, the scene in which Mrs. Coulter joins the dinner table at Jordan and the ensuing dialog replaces three(yes THREE) different scenes in the book, which the movie makers missed some parts of, such as the introduction of Lord Boreal, which plays a much more major role in The Subtle Knife. Another good example is the whole final act of Stardust, which was completely made up, as nothing remotely like it was written by Neil Gaiman. The fact that the writers felt free to change things around completely, including removing very important scenes and even warping the basic structure of the plot, as evidenced by the fact that the fight in Svalbard precedes the fight in Bolvangar. In short, you might like it if you never read the book. I saw some good acting, and some very nice visual effects, such as the zeppelins and the bear fight. But still, it was rushed, and the plot might not make too much sense, unless you take completely seriously each and every second of the movie, which is a bit much too ask of the viewer, by my book.",The Golden Compass
504,gavenbus,"Mixed Feelings, too fast.",7,1 December 2007,"Fresh from the New York sneak-preview and thought an IMDb comment would be a good place to sort out my feelings about the film, which were mixed to say the least. On a technical scale the overall quality of the film is quite good, as the exciting trailers promise. There are, however, several points in the film where special effects seem a bit awkward, particularly the sequences with Lyra riding on Iorek's back, as the actress doesn't quite line up with the animated bear--something is off visually. The wide shots of Lyra's ride feature a very obviously animated Lyra that moves unconvincingly. Iorek's face is a white canvas, flat and expressionless, with little dimension to it (except in profile), which is a shame as it doesn't match Ian McKellan's excellent voice performance.The film opens with a rather unnecessary prologue that smacks of Frank Herbert's Dune. Dust and Lyra's world are introduced in much the same way Spice Melange and Arakis are introduced in Dune. I for one think the film could have done without it. Other unnecessary sequences involve Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig) being taken captive and the Magisterium men plotting with sinister malice. Of the many sequences not used in the film two that stood out were Lord Asriel showing the frozen head to the scholars, the party of Mrs. Coulter's house, and Lyra choosing the pine bough from the shed (all of which ended up being important later in the trilogy).I was concerned that the film's Lyra would come off a bit too sophisticated, but was very pleased with Dakota's performance. She turns in some good, honest work and lives up to the character from the book, although I wish the screenplay showed more of the character's ""gift"" for lying. Nicole Kidman is not made to look like the black-haired Mrs. Coulter from the book, which might have bugged me, were her performance not so good. She's been botoxed from head to toe and delivers an icy, yet conflicted character...and it works perfectly. Eva Green's Serafina is brunette, she's described as ""fair haired"" in the book, a minor change--particularly since she, like her James Bond co-star, is barely in the film.The screenplay does a fair job of laying out all the information in a way that makes sense (which could not have been an easy task, given the heaviness of the book). The screenplay cuts to the chase, discussing ""the Authority"" right away and simplifying the motives of the various groups. In most places it works, although it feels a bit forced/rushed at times.Too often character are forced to get the audience up to speed. ""We've been traveling for HOURS!"" one character says to another just to clue the viewer in. Forced.The big bear fight manages to be exciting, but it is not the blood-bath described in the book. Bears scratch, bite, and maim one another in a bloodless world, where broken legs mend themselves just in time for the next scene. Iorek's armor comes and goes, which is odd as he refers to it as his soul and claims to be desperate for it.Lyra's discovery of the boy with the removed daemon (Billy Costa from the book is this character, probably intended to make the sequence connect more directly to Lyra). Sadly, this vital scene doesn't work. The hideousness of a person without a daemon is not felt by Lyra or by anybody on screen. You really don't get the intensity or horror that is necessary to drive the characters onward. The film could have done with a scene (as in the book) where a child is pulled too far from his or her daemon, allowing the audience to see the pain separation causes. Anything to build up that discovery. Somehow the knowledge that the magisterium is ""severing"" kids from daemons doesn't have the impact it should have. Perhaps it doesn't help that Serafina Pekkala shows up without her daemon before this scene and little fuss in made about it. I would have appreciated the scene from the book where Lyra finds the severed daemons in cages...would have helped.For my money, the severing machine looked completely wrong, and the severing sequence falls flat and fails to concern it's audience--despite the fine performances given by the actors. One would think Lyra and Pan would at least be reaching for each other while the severing is taking place.Overall the weakest part of the film is it's lack of a climax. This is due to the removal of the final three chapters of the book in which many things are explained and Lyra fulfills her goal of bringing Lord Asriel ""what he needs"". Her drive to reach him is forgotten for much of the film, but the pay-off of her reaching him is badly needed. The film ended awkwardly in the wrong place, a feeling that was felt by fans of the book as well as first-timers alike. It left you feeling unsettled.I sincerely hope that somebody else composes the music for the sequels. The music, while not bad, was forgettable. No character themes or exciting crescendos were there to support the action. The music seemed to be doing it's own thing for much of the film (not all of it).And that's what I thought. I may have built the movie up too much, what with my being a fan of the book. I'd say the place where the film suffers the most is in the fact that this epic plot swoops by too quickly, not giving it's audiences enough time to adjust to the new world, let alone live in it and appreciate it. But that's a book to film adaptation, it's hard, and I'm glad to have seen it at last.",The Golden Compass
505,girlonthemn,Golden Compass' throws the book out the window.,3,8 December 2007,"I don't think there are any spoilers in this but just in case read with caution ) I'll be honest, I had high hopes going into this movie. I read the first book over the summer and had enjoyed it. Maybe that was my first problem but the movie storyline was incredibly messed up.The first third of the movie starts out alright, with things happening as they are supposed too with only minor changes, which every book to movie has (and the changes were understandable too). It was the last 2/3's of the movie that were awful.To start they put the ending of the book in the middle of the movie, while those people who hadn't read the book wouldn't know or mind this, it actually makes certain parts really awkward. Lyra is so attached to Iorek at this point when she really had only met him 10-15 minutes earlier in the movie that it makes the dialog seem fake and the situation silly. The bond that was made over the course of the book happened too soon so what they have at this point doesn't seem right. Add in Ian Mckellen's voice for Iorek with the over the top dialog that he has, it makes for a pretty bad moment.When the directors finally decide to put in the middle of the book things seem rushed, with the addition of so many situations they spend most of the movie just blurting out information that was originally discovered in subtle ways. They put certain characters in situations that they were originally not in, which means that they were missing from parts of the movie that they were supposed to be in.Because the directors chose to put the ending scene (from the book) in the middle of the movie, the ending they chose to make create seemed confusing and premature.I went to this movie with 6 other people, only one of them had read the book like I had and her main complaint was the same as mine, the storyline being so messed up. The others who didn't notice the storyline issues' complaints were the dialog and situations were very cheesy and really over the top. Depending on the person many parts may seem like they have unintended sexual innuendos, which in a children's story is so wrong.If you go see this movie and you have read the book, get ready to be confused on why things happen when they do. And if you haven't read the book try to ignore the cheesy lines and silly situations. Of course, this is just my opinion and you might feel otherwise but I really thought they flopped on this.

For one, Philip Pullman's Dark Materials trilogy relies heavily on subtleties, that simply put, cannot be recreated for the big screen. Secondly, Chris Weitz's portfolio is hardly appropriate. The Nutty Professor 2: The Klumps? You can tell it's his first foray into the fantasy genre (or out of making bad comedy) from his ham-fisted approach to narrative structure and character development. You really don't care about any of the characters which essentially kills any tension that would have been caused by the various pitfalls and dangers that they encounter (particularly Lyra). The films main failing lies with the Directors clear lack of understanding of the profundity of the novel, dismissing it as a book for children. What was a rich, thoroughly enjoyable, and most of all realistic (within the context of a fantasy world) experience, has been butchered at the hands of Weitz. He would appear, for all his zeal to fail to grasp the important themes of the story, not to mention the overall atmosphere of the novel which was one of wonder.

The only good things about this movie was the animation and maybe one scene. By no means is this a kids/children's movie. The evil plot is definitely not for kids.Going into the movie we had an idea about the evil plot and were prepared for that portion, but I can honestly say. It made no difference. It was a waste of money mixed with a shabby plot with some good animation. Not a good recipe. Absolutely no comparison to Narnia or Lord of the Rings. They were both 100% better.

The philosophy is a cultural expression and in the art it is possible to be appreciated comprehension & show by the master, even developing an original one for its work. Whatever the intention of the work, this is valued by its complexity in the handling of resources. The work of Pullman enjoys an elaborated dogma, although the psychological specificity goes to very few personages. Its manifesto is of a religion handled like policy, but not as in it films in which it is rather a political system with dogmatic values. The film in addition to being a spectacle of visual and sonorous effects, interesting performances, and a promising argument; the facts are alternated in relation to the original book without a justification; and its plot is confusing, since the source and true intention of the author in showing an original cultural universe happen unnoticed in the spectators. The artists have been always of controversial and subversive, but that is its role and have license to continue doing it; it is sad to know that the cinema became commercial and is locked in a prejudiced censorship.

The characters in the film, however, are shallow, and the viewer is never really able to identify with them. Furthermore, the entire movie feels extremely rushed and some scenes are just forced. The movie took no time to develop any of the important subplots that made the book captivating. The story line suffered some changes that made no sense whatsoever, and only served to confuse those who weren't previously familiar with the book.The one redeeming quality of the film was the cast, which suited the various rolls well. Unfortunately, they were constrained by the poor writing and couldn't save the film.

It wasn't as good as it could've been- but then again, she was just a schoolgirl from London. There were awkward moments, but I never felt like she didn't fit as Lyra.The CGI was well done (especially the fight scenes) for a director that originally left citing inexperience in the field. Many say it's overused, but I find that unavoidable to a director that wants to remain true to Mr. Pullman's incredible masterpiece of a literature. It must have had a weigh on the budget, which I will go over later.Now, for the bad... the script. It wasn't NEARLY as bad as that abomination called Eragon, but I felt it was somewhat more pointed in the 'epic fantasy save-the-world Narnia/LOTR' genre- which, by the way, isn't what makes His Dark Materials a captivating trilogy. Although the direction may have been bad, it still remains faithful (for the most part) to the books. The fact that two very important plot lines had been switched, and the ending didn't actually bother me as much as I thought it would.One of the problems I found with the film was the casting. Although there should, certainly, have been stars (Kidman and Elliot are two that the film needs for sure) the others could have easily been replaced with unknowns, and the film would have looked and felt the same. Although if it is possible it is certainly welcome, the amounts of unnecessary stars merely inflated the already huge CGI heavy budget (which is probably why there will never be a sequel). Peter Jackson used mostly unknowns and B-movie actors (with notable exceptions) and still got his point across. I don't see why Weitz couldn't.Furthermore, Weitz inexperience as a director of fantasy films certainly shows up in the pacing of the film. I was able to understand the plot (I had read the books beforehand) but I can see how some may have found it hard to follow. However, in the actual scenes I think Weitz had a very good feel for what His Dark Materials should look like. The world seemed (at least to me) like Lyra's world.One of the complaints I hear from fellow fans is the removal of explicit references to the church, and how that somehow 'castrates' the messages of the books. I see that as an insult to Phillip Pullmans' integrity as an author- if he had to rely simply on calling the church out by name then he wouldn't have the following that he does today. The messages of the book were in the symbolism in the plot (the act of incision removing independent thought). Another complaint is that the movie cut several themes of the bears and witches out in order to make more time for Lyra, and keep the film's time down. With all the criticism that LOTR received over it's length, it's no wonder it was toned down, and seeing that Lyra is the most important part of the story I don't see why they would put priority over anything else.Overall, I think it could've been handled better, but it still is a movie worth seeing for fans of the series. It features a celebrity cast with some excellent acting, and some of the best CGI I've seen in a long time. Furthermore, if you enjoyed the movie, go pick up the books.",The Golden Compass
513,nicollemelanson-powell,Lyra Bellaqua searches for a missing friend and discovers a hidden gift within herself.,8,19 January 2008,"I disagree with the first reviewer's negative report. That viewer loved the book and compared the movie with the book - unfavourably. For those who have not read the book (or not for a long time) the film could be evaluated as a stand alone entertainment - my husband and I enjoyed the movie thoroughly and went back to see it again. It was perfectly comparable to ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" or the ""Harry Potter"" films in terms of story flow, excitement, range of interesting characters and so on. The special effects are fabulous especially with regard to the seamless integration of daemons and bears into the live action. On top of all this, the movie is simply BEAUTIFUL to look at. The illustration of dust and the action of the ilitheometer are gorgeous additions and a treat to the eye. Go without prejudice, leave expectations behind, and you will have a lovely evening.",The Golden Compass
514,kushnerc,I liked this,7,1 December 2007,"I thought that the movie was very decently done. The computer animations were fantastic and the characters were greatly planned out. I do have to say that there were a lot of unexplained things in the movie, so if you haven't read the book just be prepared to be confused a little. My friend was asking me a whole lot of questions after the movie ended. Also, be prepared to be HIGHLY disappointed at the end of the movie. They decided to take out the most crucial part of the book, the ending, and leave it for the beginning of the next movie. All I can say is that there was a giant outburst of anger and dismay at the end of the movie.",The Golden Compass
515,toomaspage,Save your money and buy the book!,2,10 December 2007,"Very disappointing. The director seems out of his depth. He's managed to strip all the emotion out of the quite wonderful books. At no point do you feel involved with any of the characters, scenes that are incredibly powerful in the book are skipped through far to quickly. Things happen with no explanation. The film needed to be much longer. Also, the ending from the book is not there, it races through to completion, with a terrible screenplay, lightly touching on elements of the story, robbing the viewer of any real insight into what's going on. A real shame because these books deserve a screen adaptation equal to the quality of Lord of the Rings. If only Peter Jackson was as keen on this books. Hopefully New Line will find someone who is up to the job for the next two movies....",The Golden Compass
516,Wilbo421,Excellent adaptation,10,14 April 2008,"I was of course disappointed with the fact that the original ending was cut. But due to my attention being on the film's production, I had time to get used to it, and there was little or no disappointment with what was actually there on screen. I didn't let what wasn't there spoil the quality of what WAS. I am fully aware that a lot of people were not prepared, but once you hear their reasoning, it does make sense. Pullman himself had a hand in this decision and he was fully consulted. He gave his approval.Something that certainly had a hand in taking this film down a peg was the decision to edit it in such a way that certain parts would make little sense and the events wouldn't exactly flow. For instance the swapping Bolvanger and Svalbard. It was decisions like this that New Line made that really helped towards the over-blown budget. However, I can see why this needed to be done after the ending was removed: Because ending it on a bear fight is obviously not a cliff-hanger, and is probably not climactic enough for it to have been the ending.Something else that shouldn't have happened was the change of Iorek's back story. Though that is just a little thing that only readers of the book will be irritated about, and as it does not lessen the richness of quality of what's on screen.This film, as I said, is very true to the source material. There is the essential plot and the whole feeling of it, which Writer/Director Weitz got down to a tee. Perfect.The acting was phenomenal, especially from the star of the film, Dakota Blue Richards. For an unknown British actor (because we all have to admit, our young talent since the beginning of the decade has not really been all that impressive), Miss Richards is excellent as the tough and inquisitive Lyra Belacqua. She, out of the entire cast, fits her part best and provides an accurate and believable (though her accent slips a couple of times, it is impressive for a thirteen year old girl) on-screen representation of the character us fans have come to love through reading His Dark Materials. Kidman's acting is brilliant as usual, perfect as the steely, complex character that is Marisa Coulter. Craig also suits the part of Lord Asriel well, being just as assertive and strong of mind as his book counterpart. Other perfect cast members include Eva Green as Serafina Pekkala and Sam Elliot as Lee Scoresby.Now Sir Ian McKellen: He is great as Iorek. He got Iorek's character down to a tee. But his casting and the removal of Nonso Anozie from the project was not a good idea, as New Line seem to have thought. I feel I am not alone in saying that Iorek's part was meant for someone whose voice we are not all familiar with. But don't get me wrong, Sir Ian Mckellen is one of my favourite actors, and he is still great in the part.The visuals were absolutely fantastic. The creators of such creatures as the Panserbjorne and the Daemons (especially Pantalaimon's polecat form) were very deserving of the Oscar they received. Especially considering the enormity and complexity of the project they had. Not only that, but the scenic images such as Svalbard, the North in general, Oxford and London were all incredible and totally believable.The sets and costumes were lavish and accurate to how I'm sure a LOT of people imagined them from the book.The dialogue is one of those problems that doesn't affect everyone. Some fans who read the books (I'm not going to say all, as that is nowhere near true at all) were disappointed with the non-complexity of the dialogue and the fact that this film had been marketed for families, not young adults as they wanted. But to be honest, it's hard to promote a film like The Golden Compass and make it look like it's specifically for young adults. No such problem would be had with any potential sequels, due to the content of the stories. But I fear that New Line did not exactly help anything by removing any parts of this film that had anything remotely complex, any helpful explanations, any events that were shown instead of just told to us with exposition.I say that, but there are quite a few instances, and if you know where to look, you can find a lot of depth in this film. Especially scenes that Pullman himself wrote in, such as the part where Marisa Coulter slaps her Daemon. Some people just laughed. Others, who understood what was happening, did not.Now, what this film did, as did the book was create a hell of a lot of questions. This, I believe, is a lot of the audiences main problem with the film, and a problem that is not actually a problem, just an attempt at getting people interested and getting people to THINK about things. This film may have been confusing for some, but not for others. When I talk about the others who understood it perfectly, these are the people who realise this is the first story of a trilogy and the people who realise we are not meant to understand everything just yet. My advice to the people who got confused would be to read the books, and then they would understand why they were ""confused"".Over all, this film was great fun, a roller-coaster ride of excitement and interest and a chance to see the first part of my favourite book trilogy get brought to life. With great turns from excellent established actors and young unknowns alike, a deep plot (just as involving as the book), awesome visuals, and just a fantastic over-all feel, this film scored high in my list of the best films of 2007.",The Golden Compass
517,Alchemically,"Nice Visuals, Poor Storytelling",4,7 December 2007,"Very poor storytelling and bad directing.I have read the book series and fully expected the screen adaptation to deviate from the novels. What I wasn't expecting was for the plot to be dumbed down to such a great extent. I felt like I was watching a true children's movie.First of all, I really had a problem with the portrayal of the Church in this and I am in no way a religious person but I understand that blatant stereotyping is childish and makes for an empty story. I heard all the bad press regarding the movie and was quite confused, since in The Golden Compass book, the true nature of the church and religion is kept rather ambiguous until the second and third novels. The Magisterium, the Church in this story, is introduced as a devious and controlling force with no real explanation as to why they are as such, or why others see them this way. They are just simply bad and the viewer is expected to except that and go along with it. The church is basically classified as the opposite of free will. I understand now why certain religious affiliations are unsettled by this movie. It really did seem that the movie was just throwing insults at authoritative power. Had the movie gone into more detail, or shown both sides of the argument pertaining to Dust and Daemons, the Magisterium would have become an enriching part of the story, and not simply a lurking evil to be feared and obeyed.Secondly, while the visuals were all quite impressive, the story itself, and the characters in it, were quite lacking. The journey northward was in no way interesting. The cast of characters introduced along the way were all very weakly developed, especially the Gyptians and the Witches. This is quite a shame, as the casting for characters such as John Faa, Farder Coram, Ma Coasta, and Serafina Pekkala was very well done. Had the relationship between Lyra and Farder Coram been developed more I think the viewer would have felt that the sea journey was an intricate part of the story as a whole, and not simply a means of getting from England to the North. It is also a shame that Ma Costa's true relation to Lyra was never mentioned, since the aid of the Gyptians seemed to come out of almost nowhere.And of course there was the ending. This is another instance of this film being watered down for the sake of a very young audience. While I understand that keeping the original ending may have distressed young viewers, the dialog in the ending seemed strained and forced. Tacky, even.I fail to see why the film earned itself a PG-13 rating when the story seemed to cater to a much younger audience.All in all, I am disappointed and likely will not be seeing any other films in this story should they be made.",The Golden Compass
518,crazy_jessie05,I was very disappointed by the film.,2,9 December 2007,"As a huge fan of the ""His Dark Materials"", I was very excited to hear about a film being made of it. In fact, i can remember going to see a different film in the cinema with my friends and watching the trailer, and telling everyone ""I cant wait to see this, it's ""Northern Lights""!"", then being shocked that they had changed the name, especially as in the book the Alethiometer is never once referred to as a ""Golden Compass"". But as I loved the book, I though ""how bad can it be?"" Very it seems. When i went to see it on the Friday after it came out I came with high hope, only to be disappointed. I was shocked at the scrambled plot line(for example the Svalbard scene before the Children of Bolvanger), the overuse of CGI where in some cases actual animals could have been used, and worst of all the ending being cut ridiculously short!! I do understand that of course some things needed to be cut out, but ending the film with the cast flying away in a balloon leaves many questions! How does this lead to the next book? What happens to Roger dying at the cliff? Mrs Coulter and Lord Asriel being reunited? Asriel walking into the Aurora, followed shortly by Lyra? I ask you, what happened to all of this?!?! If you watch the trailer, you can see some of these missing parts, but where are they in the movie? Also many parts of the movie were not how I imagined, or how they were described in the book. The bear fight, for instance, was described so intensely, the landscape, the rituals beforehand! My friend and I have discussed the character of Lee Scoresby, and we had both pictured him ginger and young, not an elderly man. And the alethiometer! I was shocked by it, it looked more like a child's play toy than a scientific instrument, a piece of plastic painted gold with pretty stickers on it, and her reading of it in the book was described as an understanding, like a conversation, in a conversation you cannot see pictures of what you yourself have not seen! I shall now say something complementary. The acting was acceptable. I do feel that some characters were better than others, and that even if Dakota's performance was a little wooden, i believe that, like the Harry Potter series, she will grow into the part and become a more relaxed actress. Now that you have read my opinion, I encourage you to watch the film and decide for yourself. Though i expect if you have read the book as I have, you will feel much the same. And for those of you that say that the film is aimed at the 13-15 age group, so adults may not appreciate it as teenagers will, i disagree. I am 15 myself.",The Golden Compass
519,popularru,Excellent!,10,19 December 2007,"I hate ""Harry Potter"" (film, not book) and many other family movies, but ""The Golden Compass"" is simply wonderful. I think the story is very interesting and cruel enough at some moments. I didn't read the book, but now I want to do it. And I believe I'll like it as much as the film. And some words about the actors... More truly - the two amazing actresses: Nicole Kidman and Eva Green. They are so much charming. My face involuntarily broke into a smile when I saw the witch queen, who so much kind to Lyra. Oh, and certainly Dakota Blue Richards. She plays very authentic as eleven-year old girl. She doesn't play emotions peculiar to the adult person. She is so sincere. I think ""The Golden Compass"" is a great film. You should see yourself.",The Golden Compass
520,dcartist,This is a good movie... it's only got 6.7 because some non-viewers are bias rating it a 1...,8,8 December 2007,"I watched this movie, and it was definitely well written and acted. The cast is excellent, the acting is nuanced, and Dakota is very good in the lead role. I do agree with some here, that the movie was clearly cut abruptly in many places to reduce run-time. I can tell where there would have been more explicit narrative for some events......but it was extremely easy to follow what was happening. I didn't consider that confusing. Merely hurt the pacing of the movie.13.7% ratings are a 1 on the user rating (which is utterly ridiculous), and that simply tells me that this is overzealous right wingers who are angry about the Atheist leanings of the author, and they put 1s in there without watching the film. This is underhanded, and frankly reflects poorly on those people.I don't believe this movie tears down Christianity or religion in any particular way, but I'm sure some people will view the Magisterium as the Catholic church or something...At any rate, a very good movie.",The Golden Compass
521,thebutcher80,Disappointed,4,8 December 2007,"I was so extremely excited for this movie, I had just read the books and truly could not wait to see how it translated to the screen having such a vivid and vibrant plot. My excitement was short lived however when this butchered movie began to roll. The largest flaw was that of character development. The whole beginning of the book truly creates Lyras character and her supporting characters such as Roger, Lord Asriel, Master of Jordan, and so forth; this instead was replaced with a few minutes of monologue, and if you happened to sneeze you would miss the explanation of daemons (which is integral to the plot) they could have included the catacomb exploration to explain that but alas they clipped that as well. And what about Lord Asriels visit, why change who tried to poison him? and what happened to the trepanned head of Stanislaus Grumman? This was a powerful scene in the book, but it became a 2 minute meeting on screen. Also, I don't know about you but I pictured Lord Asriel as this big powerful looking man that commanded a room, not quite Daniel Craig.So she leaves with Mrs. Coulter and again a rushed relationship which never develops as it does in the book. No visit to the Royal Artic Institute, no fitting for arctic clothing, where did it all go; and then the escape, which was perfect in the book, became a very short scene that was completely different.The Gyptians. This was a HUGE part of the book, especially her relationships with them, all of it was axed. Once she arrives at the Gyptian city there is a ton of character development between Lyra and John Faa, Farder Coram, Ma Costa; none of this was included, in fact what took weeks in the book was dwindled down to a short conversation immediately upon Lyras arrival. What happened to finding out that Ma Costa nursed her as a child? or finding out from John Faa that Lord Asriel and Mrs. Coulter were her parents, and why she ended up at Jordan College? We leave this part in the movie not knowing why the Gyptians want to help, why they agree to take her along, no town vote or attack plan, in the book she is taken under Farder Corams wing for weeks.From here it is a rush job to a cut off ending. Her relationship with Iorek is cut, she all of a sudden has a strong relationship with him? The boy who was ""cut"" was not Billy Costa, why change that, and the boy ends up dying. The Samoyans bring her to Bolvangar and all the events leading to her escape were cut out. The movie brings us to the Ice Bears directly and although things were cut the bear fight was done pretty well, but there was no build up so it was not as intense as it should have been, no pinnacle. Even Ioreks background was changed, he was outcast for killing another bear. The final fight scene after the children's escape was also anticlimactic due to the lack of build up and tension, you almost didn't care.Now I understand they were making way for the next movie, but cutting out the entire ending??? The movie left you with nothing resolved, Lord Asriel was in it for 2 minutes. I only hope Philip Pullman does not sell his soul on ""The Subtle Knife"" because he was royally abused on this one.",The Golden Compass
522,rml8607,Really Disappointed,3,8 December 2007,"I am a major fan of the books and upon hearing the production of the film, I practically jumped for joy. I was going into this film, knowing from previous reviews that they had changed a few things and that some people were disappointed. But, I went in with a clear mind hoping that it would still be spectacular.The movie was beautiful visually, the acting was good, and I loved seeing the daemons come to life. But through all of this the story was ripped apart and then sloppily taped back together, with crucial scenes missing. Even with this happening, I was still happy and I kept watching. Then, the movie gets to the end and I was worried about what I had heard. Many had said that the ending was changed and I was paranoid at how badly it had been altered. But, to all of you please understand the ending was not changed, it was completely gone! People sitting behind me in the theatre (who seemed to be unfamiliar with the books) were outraged at the empty and terrible ending, and I almost lost it. I feel like they ruined a wonderful story for no reason. They cut off the movie before the real ending, leaving you confused and angry.I hope that there is a Director's cut out there somewhere, and I hope it has those missing scenes.",The Golden Compass
523,brewsugar,Kooky Christians,8,15 December 2007,"One of the comments posted says more about the poster than the movie; ""This movie was very disturbing. A movie that has to do with killing God? ...If he doesn't believe {in God} then why does he write about God? I think the movie was lame any way. It's a spin off of Chronicles of Narnia {which} was an amazing movie. ..I wish I would've know ahead of time what the movie was really about. I am shocked I haven't seen any thing on television about the true meaning of this movie. And I am really shocked that it was released during the Christmas season."" It would appear that the poster is bearing false witness; because (1) the ""Golden Compass"" has absolutely NO references to killing God. Nor is it possible to infer it from anything in the movie. (2) Obviously the poster has therefore not seen the movie, or they would know better, and (3) Therefore she has clearly been warned ""ahead of time"" about the movie.Have things really gotten so bad, that christians now use children's films as proxy wars? Compass VERSUS Narnia? Its clear that the poster would have preferred to live in Lyra's world, where heresy was still a crime.The movie itself was damaged by its rolling over so as not to offend Christians. What did they hope for? That they would avoid a boycott? All they did was to emasculate the movie. Face it; if you have a movie that talks about spiritual matters, its going to be boycotted unless you follow the party line. So make it for those of us who will appreciate it! Read the book; its far better; before it gets burned! The Magisterium is alive and well in modern America.And packersgirl?You look foolish if you post verbatim something you have been told by your priests without checking it first. ""God"" is only ""killed"" in the later books; in fact, he cant be killed, but there is a war, and his authority is threatened. The same story is told in Christian mythology; its called the war between Satan and god. Its actually a very interesting plot about ""doing over"" the expulsion from eden. But hey, you want to take your priests word for it and not enjoy one of the best books on spirituality and theological questions over the past hundred years of so? Go ahead; stick to the officially controlled low-calorie pap you're used to. God forbid you explore what so much of your life revolves around.But you'd have to read the books anyhow; the movie has been watered down into just another shoot-em-up. Wars - now there's something that christians seem to warm to. Movies where lions are slaughtered in pagan rituals, whipping people with the blood flying off in buckets.",The Golden Compass
524,julie-689,Gravely Saddened,6,9 December 2007,"I was more than sad to go watch a movie I had long been awaiting for with my 6 year old and her friend last night! Of course they loved it, though somewhat frightened by the polar bear war. What the film DID cover, was well done, but the bottom line is that the film should have been on par with the Rings Trilogy or Star Wars or Potter or even Narnia was quite well done. This film should have been 2.5 hours long and actually COVER the actual plot and important story elements. The understanding of the witches, parallel worlds, and the entire last 1/3 of the book was handled so poorly -- I was astonished! Did they run out of funds to cover the CGI or were they under pressure from the far right? I just can't understand why they would not respect the integrity of the actual story that was written? I was prepared by what Johnathan Ross had said, who admits his family is a big fan of the books as am I. I am especially disappointed because there was so much potential. An excellent cast, and the scenes from the book they actually covered were great. There were however entire gaps in the story line, and the most critical relationships between the characters sidelined, such as the relationship between Lyra and the Witch.....",The Golden Compass
525,ka_wolcott,Movie does not do the book justice,4,28 December 2007,"I will be the first to admit that movie adaptations seldom live up to the books that they are based off of, but this movie seems to be exceptionally bad. Not only were significant portions of the story left out (most notably, the end of the book was summarily cut out of the movie version), but other parts were completely fabricated. Granted it's been awhile since I've read the book, but some of the events that happened in the movie did not happen in the book. So, it would appear that a great deal of artistic liberties were taken with the script to the detriment of the film.On the other hand, the special effects for the film, especially the daemons and the polar bears, are INCREDIBLE! That alone is what helped boost my rating of the film. As far as casting goes, notable performances include Sam Elliott,who is quintessentially rugged for the part of Lees Scoresby and no one else could play him. Ian McKellan was the perfect choice for the voice of Iorek Burnison. Dakota Blue Richards, who made her debut in the film, held her own and I think she did a really good job bringing Lyra to life! They could have done a lot more with the character of Lord Asriel, especially with Daniel Craig playing him. Lord Asriel was a major part of the book, but was minimized in the film. I think that the director and producers should have capitalized on the steely blue eyes of Mr. Craig which I think could go along way with the development of this character in particular.Overall, I think this book will be a huge disappointment to anyone who has read the book and will leave them with a sense of ""What the *insert four-letter word of choice*?!""; however, those who have not read the book prior to seeing the movie will probably enjoy it a great deal more.",The Golden Compass

527,anyday-2,This Compass Lied,4,4 December 2007,"All the elements of a 10 star movie are obviously prevalent here, but they don't all get put into play.I don't understand why New Line advertised this as the ""next Lord Of The Rings epic"", when they gave that movie close to three hours of film time and this only two! (?) Another half hour at least of this movie would have done it more justice, because it felt extremely rushed. It seemed like they were throwing information out at you too quick to fully grasp, and never letting the cast just immerse themselves in it.The music here was nothing short of ordinary. I don't remember a single song from the movie save the ""gyption theme"". I honestly think the music could have been 100 times better, and bring more immersion in.However, I believed the cast was great. It is truly great that Lyra, portrayed by Dakota Blue Richards, now has a face. They picked someone with the look and talent to really shine. Lord Asriel, portrayed by Daniel Craig and Ms. Coulter, portrayed by Nicole Kidman were played fantastically. Although Daniel Craig fans will be disappointed. He only has a 15 minute cameo. Lee Scoresby, portrayed by Sam Elliot, was great. It seems they intended him for a bit of comic relief, but I just had hoped they gave him more time to show it off due to the non-stop drama sequences.The scenery was amazing, and very believable. The daemons, magic, witches, are all very well done and very beautiful.I see this movie as a financial failure. You have to look at this from a critical view, the ""new comers"". The people the movie is trying to grab. I brought ten people to the advanced screening December 1st, four of which had read the books (myself included). They (and myself) had said that the plot was too rushed. The six that had not read them either said it was too confusing and ending up requiring explanations, or said it was too boring because they didn't take the time to flesh out the characters. Coincidentally, one of them got too frustrated with it and bored and walked out.Fanaticly, I really like this movie (but it is real rushed), however I tried looking at this movie with a newcomer view. Reality wise, people walking in who aren't loyal fanatics are probably going to be very disappointed. Unfortunately, the list of ""loyal fanatics"" isn't going to be enough to make this movie a success. At any rate, this is definitely no Lord Of The Rings...

For anyone who has read the book I'm sure you will agree that the ordering, some characters and the ending were not at all true to the book. The ending was the most surprising and disappointing as it missed out the last 3 chapters of the book, scenes between Lyra and lord asriel which are quite important leading on to the next book - will be interesting to see if they turn the second book into a film. I kind of wish i hadn't re-read the book before i saw the film because whilst watching it i could only pick out a very few scenes that were partially linked to the book. However, the film wasn't all bad as the computer animations were brilliant and the daemons were done well. I also think the casting was spot on - i couldn't have imagined a better actor for lord asriel than Daniel Craig and Nicole kidman as Mrs coulter was brilliant. All in all i would recommend this film to anyone who hasn't read the book in the last year, or anyone who is under the age of 14.",The Golden Compass
530,sjr53,Really enjoyable!,10,6 December 2007,"Watching this film on its UK release date, I couldn't help wondering whether I was watching the same film as all the people giving it such poor reviews. The film I saw stuck as closely as one could expect to the plot of the book (excluding the ending, of which more later), had some great acting (sadly only cameo roles for most of the big-name actors, but Dakota Blue Richards was superb as Lyra), used visual effects to create a truly fantastical world, and kept up a great pace throughout. Maybe it's just me, but that for me is more than enough to make an enjoyable film! Sure there were a number of differences from the book, but there was a huge amount of material there, no way is all of that going to make it into a film. Some events did get rather shortened, and I did rather wish that the film had been a little longer, but at least it didn't follow the recent trend of 3+ hours epics, instead giving a tightly focused film - which worked as a *film*, not just as a simple translation of the book.For me, this film was going to succeed or fail on the performance of Lyra, and although perhaps her lack of experience sometimes showed, she brought a refreshing quality to the role, mixing youthful innocence with an extreme inquisitiveness, just as described in the book. The film could also have failed if daemons had appeared simply as funny talking animals, but I thought they managed to capture that incredible human-daemon bond almost perfectly, due in part to some extremely lifelike CGI.A lot of people complained about the ending being missed out. Well, yes it was. But chill out guys, it's going to be in the next film, it's not like it's gone for good. In my humble opinion it fits better there anyway, I always found the book ending a confusing and needless cliffhanger.Highly recommended - go and see it!",The Golden Compass
531,kilroy2626,Impressed and Very Satisfied,8,1 December 2007,"I am about 2 thirds of the way through the book when I decided to go to the limited engagement sneak preview of The Golden Compass. I feel that the film exceeded my expectations regardless of the structure change made by the film adaptation.The story was changed moderately, but not too much to take away from the mood of the book, and was in no way detrimental to the flow of the story. Otherwise, this movie was a roller-coaster ride from beginning to end! The effects exceeded my expectations. The flow of the daemons in the film was almost completely convincing, however there were times when the speech of the animals had that typical ""computer animated falseness"" that you see in the cg cartoons. Other than some minor CG blemishes, the realism is some of the most convincing I have seen! The polar bear is completely lifelike and the animal morphing I felt was simply spectacular.The flow of the film is very fast, which is a negative and a positive. While it really leaves us guessing or feeling unfulfilled in some of the crucial story elements, it also sets the pace for an exhilarating fast-paced adventure story that keeps you on the edge! The broad range of characters prevents the film from truly developing the characters that we really WANT to know. Since the book is a 3 part series, hopefully these characters will develop further in the next 2 films.I must say that there were several parts in this film that surprised me, considering this is marketed as a family film. This is a dark film. This could frighten some small kids. I feel this film definitely belongs in the pg-13 rating, and might even be a bit much for a 13 year old for the more sheltering type parents. Not only can it be conceived as very violent, there are some very adult themes that could be considered questionable.Overall, this is a film I would like to see again, and I am DYING to see the next film in the series. I walked out of this film excited, satisfied and wanting more. Might want to leave the young ones at home, but you won't regretting fighting for front row seats on a Friday night for this flick.",The Golden Compass

533,underyourspellx3,"8.5 out of 10, for me.",9,9 December 2007,"I heard from a lot of people that I would be disappointed with the movie. So, expecting the worst, I finally saw it (after having read the book, of course), and was quite happy with it. It must be different depending on whether one has read the book and how attached they were to the book. I thought Nicole Kidman was absolutely perfect for Mrs. Coulter, and Dakota was a wonderful choice for Lyra. Though Dakota was a little too sweet compared to the Lyra in the book (who was far more rebellious), she did a wonderful acting job. A few parts about the backgrounds for certain people were changed- and that bothered me a bit. Lord Asriel (In my opinion) did not fit what I had imagined him to be. In the book he was portrayed as far more frightening- and so that was disappointing. Other than that, I give it six thumbs up, and hope to see a sequel =]",The Golden Compass
534,antonverberne,"Very nice, even if you are not into this type of film.",7,4 December 2007,"Let me start by saying I'm not a particular fan of this genre. I was offered to be at one the movie premiere so that is the reason I have already seen the movie.I was not familiar with the book and had no knowledge about the story and therefor I did not know what to expect.Despite not being a fan I liked the movie very much. In the beginning you get sort of 'rushed' in the story. Lots of things aren't really well explained (e.g. the daemons) and you just have to figure it out yourself as you go along. But once you've gone passed this the movie becomes quite enjoyable. The story is quite surprising and the acting by Dakota Blue Richards is very good. However Nicole Kidman was a bit disappointing to my liking. She seems to get more rigid by the year.Some scenes are beautifully rendered, specially when the ice bears are involved. Overhere the movie is marketed as a children's movie for children over 9 years old. I found the story a bit too complicating and some scenes too violent for children.There are a lot of parallels with movies like Harry Potter, The Chronicles of Narnia and Lord of the Rings (choosen children who have the power decide the fight good vs evil and are helped by a variety of magical creatures and people) I'm not sure if people who aren't real fans are really up for another one of these sort of movies.",The Golden Compass
535,adam-1494,A real let down,3,6 December 2007,"Having seen the Golden Compass I can honestly say Im hoping they don't make a follow up.The story was truncated beyond the necessity involved in translating a book to film, the intricacies of the characters (especially Lyra) were swept over with a series of single scene expositions, that despite the talents of all the actors involved failed to accurately portray their persona's or motivations.Whether or not you agree with Pullmans subtext in the book or not, the film failed miserably to deliver any semblance of the authors story.On the plus side the Daemons and other effects were expertly achieved, fantastically voiced. The actors did their best with what came across as a disjointed, amateurish script. Key plot hocks were evaded, key sub text elements were missing and the directors clear priority of not offending any member of a dogmatic organised religion shone through the entire production.In a few words: Great actors and effects in an unworthy script that was neither a faithful production of Pullmans work nor anything other than a flawed attempt to achieve box office takings.",The Golden Compass
536,misshappy26,A disappointing attempt,4,9 December 2007,"Firstly, one thing that is apparent from reading these reviews is that the public are very divided in their opinion of whether the film truly captures the essence of the book.I read all three books (in 4 weeks I might add) to prepare for film; ensuring I knew the characters and story well enough to be able to appreciate and add more to the film. I needn't have bothered.I thought the film was confusing and I'm unsure why Chris Weitz chose to take the many shortcuts he did, or was it that New Line didn't allow him more time? The storyline chopped and changed and didn't follow the book, which I know is normal for book-to-film adaptations but to change the order completely and cut the ending???? I was very disappointed with how the Bolvanger scenes were handled, they are crucial to the film, as is the 'you cannot trick a bear' storyline from Iorek and now unexplained leaves the watcher confused as to why the fight scene is so important to the story.The scenery, set design, costumes and daemons (in particular) were great and clearly had time spent on them to ensure 'authenticity'.I thought Nicole Kidman was perfectly cast but am unable to assess Daniel Craig as he was barely on screen, another oddity. Next comes the matter of Lyra; Dakota Blue Richards. I'm sure Dakota acted her little socks off but for me, she wasn't right. Lyra is rough around the edges, she is unkempt, dirty faced and has unbrushed hair, she is impolite and unsubtle - so why was Dakota's portrayal completely the opposite? The book was magical and captivating, the attention to detail by Pullman was incredible and I can only assume he wasn't allowed as much input in to the film as J.K. Rowling.The film left me bored at stages and confused at other points, if they dare to attempt the other two books, let's hope the next director has read these pages of feedback.",The Golden Compass
537,kaitlyndrews,Great Movie but Incomplete Ending,9,28 December 2007,"Okay, I've read the book and this movie will probably confuse people who have not read the book. Everything about this movie was great except the ending which was kind of a let-down. IN the book, Lyra and Roger arrive in the North to Lord Asriel. Lord Asriel kidnaps Roger and uses him as part of an experiment to open up a gateway into other worlds, which Roger dies in the process. Lyra then leaves in this gateway to find out about dust. The movie just ends when they are about to go for Lord Asriel after they free the children in Bolvangar. Also, this movie is probably going to be pretty confusing if you never read the books. If you have read the books you will notice that things have been changed, mainly a part was added onto beginning. That's all I have to say about the movie.",The Golden Compass
538,marktmorris,Intoomuchofahurry!,6,10 December 2007,"I adore the His Dark Materials trilogy. I love Lyra, Iorek, Serafina and the rest. Even the terrifying Mrs Coulter, a deliciously evil villain up there with the Wicked Queen from Snow White. So when I first heard that the people behind The Rings films were going to make them I was thrilled. But then when I heard that the esteemed director of American Pie was at the helm, my thrill wilted. And for me, the disappointing feeling I have in the pit of my stomach is is all the fault of Chris Weitz in the Director's chair and Anne Coates and Co in the editors suite. Plot, plot, plot, rush, rush, rush, big bear fight, another big fight, the end. Phew! Ironically the film actually started to feel a little long on the bottom because it was in too much of a hurry to finish. I was far from gripped. The time was just not taken to properly develop the characters, the relationships between them, and especially their relationships with their daemons. Who cares about the Gyptians? Who is really afraid of the Gobblers, you hardly see them or their child-napping and you don't have time to fear them before they're forgotten. What's the big deal about being cut from your daemon? The most we saw was Pan looking a little nervous at the idea. The scene where Lyra is almost severed from Pan should have been one of the most truly terrifying scenes in fantasy cinema. Girls and boys the world over should have been having nightmares about it for weeks after. I doubt they'd even remember it.If The Subtle Knife does ever get made may I be so bold as to make a few suggestions? First, don't let Mr Weitz anywhere near it. Toilet humour and comedy he can do. His Dark Materials, he cannot. How about Peter Jackson (although he's probably had his fill of epic fantasy by now) or even Terry Gilliam? Who else would be good?Second, keep the cast. Lucy Bevan and Fiona Weir deserve their own standing ovation for pitch perfect casting. Bravo. Dakota Blue Richards was tremendous. And finally, take your time. Be patient. Tell the story and don't be afraid of the quiet bits. Think of it this way. The books are not far short of 1000 pages long all told and have been read, re- read and loved by children of all ages all around the world. Give children credit. They can understand the big ideas, they can grasp the subject matter if the story is told properly. Many of them already have. So don't patronise them. The best children's cinema (and this particular child is in his mid-30s!) trusts the audience and treats them with respect. Please trust them. For example, why didn't Billy Costa die? Didn't want the children to be upset? Why not? ET died! And if you don't have serious consequences then there is no peril. And if there is no peril then, well, we just don't care. 'Don't worry Billy, we'll find your daemon'. What?!For all of that, I still enjoyed The Golden Compass. But it should have been, could have been so much more. A Golden opportunity wasted.",The Golden Compass
539,ima-chunkey-monkey,WONDERFUL!!!!! It's so much more than what I expected,10,11 December 2007,"I have only finished watching the movie but an hour ago or more.I'm 13 years old and finished reading the whole trilogy at the start of the year, all through out the year, I feared that this movie would turn out like Eragon of last year, a complete SCREW UP! But no this movie has stuck very well to the book.Few parts have been changed but I can see the reasons behind the changes. Take the ending for example, I have read many comments voicing their disgust at the ending, but I see the ending of the book a spectacular opening for The Subtle Knife and here's the not-so-big-secret, they've already film the ending or should I say beginning of TSK, if any of you people feel like seeing glimpses of the proper ending go back and watch the first few trailers and the Comic-COn Preveiw, in them you see the Bridge To The Stars opening, a scene of Lyra holding a DEAD Roger in her arms screaming ""I'M NOT YOUR'S I'll NEVER BE YOURS!"" at the shocked Mrs Coulter and a scene of Marisa and Asriel pashing with the blazing bridge to the stars behind them.For all you people saying that the ending ruined the movie, you maybe right but, it opened the big screen up to The Subtle Knife and probably The Amber Spy Glass Yer anyway I loved the movie, the book-to-movie changes made tones of sense even to a senseless 13 year old (me!) and remember the books were aimed at teens not adults so why shoddily the movie be aimed at adults. 10 stars! :D",The Golden Compass

541,stevetenhave-1,It was significantly better than I expected.,8,28 November 2007,"Having seen the London World Premier I was left with one simple fact. I am looking forward to the sequels. Any negatives aside the movie worked very well and it was engaging and extremely entertaining.From the outset you are drawn into a world that is so similar to our own but also wildly different. There are airships for travelling powered by what look like energy spheres rather than combustion engines and carriages powered in a similar way but still with a semi Steam Punk Victorian feel. The cities and environments are wonderfully realised and vividly colourful.Dakota Blue Richards as Lyra played a brilliant lead role and I suspect we will see more from this talented young lady. Her character was very believable and was exactly as I would've pictured her from the book.Nichol Kidman was both stunningly radiant and menacing as Marisa Coulter. Again she perfectly suited the role and in my opinion fully justified the choice that Phillip Pullman made in asking that she be in the movie.For me the other really stand out role was the armoured bear Iorek Byrnison. Voiced by Ian McKellen he was a character that resonated with presence and power. To me this is what I expect from a CG character. The movement just felt right and I constantly got a feeling of the massive power in him.Having read the book before seeing the movie I had some preconceptions but these rapidly went out the door for a good reason, I was enjoying the movie. It does not depart too much from the book and then only to allow it to move with a decent pace which The Golden Compass does very well.There are times when the CG feels a little incongruous; the one stand out time I noticed was when Lyra is in a 'horseless carriage'. The carriage had that overly clean feel to it that put me off with Star Wars Episode One. Apart from that one point I felt that the CG complimented the movie and at no stage felt frivolous.The demons (this worlds version of a soul) were just brilliant especially the transitions between one form and another. The children's demons have not yet 'settled' and as such shift shapes depending on their childs moods or situations, one minute being a stoat, another being a bird or a cat. They were all immediately endearing and very entertaining in their own way. For me some of the forms were better realised than others but as a whole the work that the animal animation team did was just breathtaking.The stand out scene for me is the big fight between Iorek Bynison and the Armoured Bear King. It was jaw dropping and insanely dramatic. The combat leaves you breathless and stunned. You shift between being blown away by the CGI and being dumbstruck by the share power of the clash of these massive creatures. The climax of the fight left the cinema initially silent and then everyone broke into a great applause of both appreciation and a feeling of justice for Iorek. For me this was easily the best scene in the movie.Without giving away too much the ending is not the same as the book so I am curious as to how the subsequent movies will translate but am left with faith that New Line will do them the justice that they deserve.As an end note the controversy surrounding the anti religious connotations did not come through. The Golden Compass is a ripping yarn that has been reconstructed in movie form with what I consider to be a success. I really think that this movie will appeal to the target audience and will definitely not be a let down to lovers of the book. There are one or two things that I would've liked to have seen done differently but nothing to really detract from my enjoyment. All in all the Golden Compass is a really good movie that keeps you entertained from start to finish.7.5/10",The Golden Compass
542,impairedproductions,Surprisingly Good,8,1 December 2007,"For some strange reason, a theater in the middle of the cornfield in Indiana had a sneak preview of the Golden Compass, and being a fan of the books I decided to take advantage of it. I wasn't sure what I was getting into, as there seems to be a rather large glut of Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings wannabes crowding theaters now and in the near future. This version of the Golden Compass beautifully brings the books to life and was very pleasing to watch with rather nice visuals. The acting is quite good, especially from the young lead, and the animation makes one wonder what they can't do with computers these days. The only true complaint I have about this movie is that it is difficult to understand and follow if one is not familiar with the books. Some scenes at the beginning seems disconnected, but after the halfway point the story comes together. The Golden Compass series is rather dark in its nature, and I'm glad that the movie didn't pull any punches with the supernatural combat (which is awesome, specifically when the witches and bears do battle). Some liberty is taken with the story as expected, and many church references are renamed, but the quality of the story never suffers. I recommend the movie and I look forward to seeing the rest of the trilogy completed.",The Golden Compass

Although I know it is hard to make such a book into a movie, a lot of details have either been left out or completely changed.I would have expected Lyra to be more shabby and aggressive, and the completely inexplicable thing is Mrs. Coulter has blonde instead of black hair. Also, her Daemon is for me a total misinterpretation of how the book describes it, I would actually expect the same monkey but with long hair as it is described in the book, and its color was also completely not gold. Furthermore, I would not have put Ian McKellen as the voice of Iorek Byrnisson, it doesn't emanate so much power.The storyline is completely ruined because so many scenes and information have been left out, as well as a lot of information being given out before it was supposed to leaving a lot of suspension out of the whole movie.",The Golden Compass

Important details cropped, i'm starting to worry: 3Lyra with Mrs. Coulter: this should have been a really easy montage sequence but instead stumbles over terrible acting, Weitz's ideas about daemons, and bad editing. this is getting kinda painful, actually: 2Lyra's escape and travel with the Gyptians: disastrous pacing, but possibly the first line actually taken from the book in this section. Seraphina Pekkala just seems stupid and Lyra's ability to read the alethiometer comes out of the blue without a word of explanation. really, this sucks: 1Trollesund and journey north: Iorek was kicked out of Svalbard for losing a fight? why isn't the can't-trick-a-bear conversation in there? i don't even know what the hell Weitz was trying to pull with these changes, this is utter crap. ughhhhhh: 0Svalbard: OK, they're really changed the sequence here. and there's no mention of the fact that the ways of the bears has been changed by their new king. the fight between the bears is OK, but the drama of not being able to trick a bear unless he's acting like a human is all gone. Iorek tears off Ragnar's jaw and rips out his throat. just to make sure we realize this ain't no damn kids movie!: 0Bolvangar: out of sequence crap and Lyra ends up at Bolvangar. worst editing ever, no set up, no discussion about what intercision is really, no metal blade (did he read the subtle knife?!?!), no saving the daemons... i just don't understand what the hell (stronger words would be used if IMDb allowed) is going on. and did he just have Nicole Kidman faint as a cop out? is it the 1950's?!?!

I was drawn in by the stellar cast, and the fact that Nicole Kidman looked to be one of the villains.I left disappointed; the story is weak - supporting characters are not developed at all and you find yourself not caring for them. The central character is as irritating as the wooden young actress who plays her. The film simply never gains momentum until the last 20 - 25 minutes, by which time you've stopped giving a damn.The biggest crime is the poor use of one of the strongest casts I've seen for a while. First and second-billed Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig have just a handful of scenes between them. Christopher Lee, who again is billed quite highly, has a whopping two lines. If I had Christopher Lee in a film of mine, I'd make good use of him - I promise you that. Derek Jacobi is present but underused - as are Kathy Bates, Tom Courtenay, and Kristin Scott Thomas. The only actors who earned their paychecks were Sam Elliot and Ian McKellen, who voiced a naff-looking CGI polar bear (albeit very well). All of these seasoned actors deliver the goods - but that's no good if they're never on screen! Not enough gritty storyline, intriguing characters, action, suspense, or star-power to keep me interested for the film's duration.

She was one of those people that you cheered in the cinemas as the baddies closed in with their assortments of dicing equipment. Also she was one of those people you cursed at as they somehow miraculously escape from pleasant death certain situations.In all, the story telling was so bad that once again, I find myself looking through my bag for the Dakota Blue Richards doll and my collection of penetrating pins (Probably not the first time for her).

549,notasgood2,A good adaptation with acceptable edits.,9,8 December 2007,"Firstly i'd like to say that I read all the books when I was a kid and reread them recently and that I think this adaptation is very worthy of the series.The action scenes were pretty incredible. For the final battle at the climax I was kind of afraid I'd be stuck watching something like the battle in The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, which was really one of the worst battle scenes ever, but what I got was a spectacle filled with arrows and witches, an armored bear, a Tarter trying to sick his wolf on a child (unsuccsessfully of course), and some pretty golden flashes of dissipating animal familiars. What I liked most was that the film was quickly placed and energizing while still encompassing the important parts of the novel.Despite the fast pacing of the film we still get a good grasp of the characters and their personalities (but I've read the books so that may not be necessarily true). This is due to almost perfect casting. Every character was able to produce the same effects in my brain as when they were in the books. Dakota Blue Richards was perfect and, except for a small amount of stumbled lines that is perfectly acceptable with a child actress, fit in perfectly with the other, more experienced cast. Ian McKellen sounds exactly like a skull crushing polar bear.Another thing that I am glad for is that the religious themes are just as- say, allegorical (maybe?) as they are in the book. Some people think this book is anti religious, or that it portrays Christianity as a corrupt, violent association. No it doesn't. There is nothing that links the religion in the book with Christianity (except mono-theism), and the same is true of the movie. But we know that religious associations CAN do horrible things, and in this world they do.The cuts and edits of sections of the novel from the movie are completely acceptable. Though they do cut off the very end of the novel, it's what happens at the end that sparks off the narrative of the next book, so they left it for the next movie instead of leaving the nasty(er) cliff-hanger.I thought the film was really well put together and it made my night, knowing that they didn't bungle one of the favored things of my childhood.",The Golden Compass
550,floateruk-1,Please read the book..............................................,1,7 December 2007,"I'll start by pointing out the good points in this awful film.The visuals are stunning. The decorations, the vehicles, the costumes and the sets are brilliant. The fight scene at the end was pretty good too.Thats it.The rest of the film is the poorest representation of the book that anyone could ever have possibly made. They take no time to explain anything, or to explore any of the characters or story lines in any depth.There are constantly points throughout the film where characters magically know things that have happened without any way of them physically knowing. There's even one point where a 10foot armoured bear appears in front of a legion of soldiers out of nowhere! Out of nowhere! How does an armoured bear appear in front of maybe 200 people without nobody saying ""oh, look over there Dave, there's a bleedin armoured bear coming our way"". Pathetic.The story line has been savaged down to it's most basic parts, and is fed to the audience in small three line bits every two or three minutes, which makes the film feel like it's not developing, but is constantly being forcefully shunted along.I could go on, but i won't.If there was ever a book to read and film never to watch, this is it. The book makes you love the characters, wraps you in what begins as a tiny story, and ends as an epic, it's full of emotion, feeling, depth, and philosophy. It can in no way be translated into a film. It's too deep. It's too long. It's too full.I cannot recommend the books enough. I cannot put the film down any more.",The Golden Compass
551,qt_t94,A response,10,8 December 2007,"My thoughts exactly. I was HUGELY disappointed by the ending, and while everyone filed out of the theater, I sat there with my mouth hanging open. The ending was probably the worst I have ever seen. The end of the book is perfect-- sad, suspenseful, etc. There would have been absolutely no difficulty in transferring the ending to the screen, nothing too difficult to film or make. It would have left the audience on the edge of their seat. It would have been incredible. The movie itself wasn't so hot, but it would have been more than passable were it not for the ending. I was truly horrified that they ended on that disgustingly corny line... how much worse can you make it?? They made it seem like a children's story, with a happy ending and all. What they don't seem to realize is that the novel has many messages and morals that are definitely NOT childish. The music was dull, nothing like the genius soundtrack that I had expected. Howard Shore should have done the score, he did a fantastic job on The Lord of the Rings, and good music would have made this movie much better. I'm really heartbroken that they've done such a horrible disservice to such a great story, and I really hope that the next two movies are very very different. p.s. If they don't end up killing Roger in the movies, I will personally skewer them and have them for lunch.",The Golden Compass
552,patricochet,Incomplete,7,23 August 2009,"I am a fan of Phillip Pullman's trilogy and the first thing i have to say is that the film is missing the last few scenes from the book. Normally this wouldn't be a problem as they would be included in any sequels, but in this case the exclusion of the final scene removes the twist (which i will not mention) and leaves the film feeling empty, and removes all significance of Lord Asrael, the Northern Lights, and leaves the audience without an explanation for many key issues such as ""Dust"", the purpose of the experimental station, and the alternate reality's which the scholars witness in the opening scene.Apart from this disappointment the film was enjoyable, although it could have made more effort to keep in phase with the book, and it had great CG. The one slight fault in the casting is the inclusion of so many child actors as often their performance is transparent. This is relatively unavoidable though as many of the key characters are children.Overall I would recommend that you read the book (titled ""the Northern Lights"" in the UK) before watching the film, as it will seem a lot more relevant.",The Golden Compass
553,sam-praetoria,Surprisingly good,9,29 November 2007,"Disclaimer: Spoilers ahead.Prior to watching the premiere of 'The Golden Compass' in Odeon, Leicester Sq, I had never read the book nor heard of the writer who wrote it. It was only recently after seeing a trailer of it on television was I keen to seeing the film. As for its rumoured Atheist-theme, I beg to differ. After all, it is entirely fiction! The film, I must say was brilliant! Characters played by both Richards and Kidman was splendid. The tomboyish and somewhat ragamuffin Lyra seemed like one of those characters you read about in story books; rough around the edges but a diamond in the rough, and perhaps someone you'll trust and want to be friends with for life. As for Coulter, her'exquisite' cold nature that exudes from her was just enough to make you wonder what is really going on in her mind; and yet you don't want to know. I kept wondering what her real intentions were and if they were all really that bad; it seemed to me that there was more to her than meets the eye.The fight between the two bears was amazing. I love the part when Ragnar says 'Is that all?' after which Iorek leaps at him and cracks his neck with one deadly snap and twist. Almost military-like. And suddenly, the audience in Odeon cheer.For cinematography and location, I found the northern theme somewhat pleasing, in terms of how it perfectly accentuated the surreal and frigid but magical winter environment. There was the familiar chill of the weather to it, and yet it was enthralling.One quirk, I noted was how Lyra read the compass. I had initially expected more in the reader's ability to decipher the compass's ways. Instead, all the girl did was explained 3 of the many symbols surrounding the compass, in a child-like perspective. Needless to say, perhaps, it was this plain innocence that propelled the quest for the truth.It was sad when Billy's daemon, (your soul in form of an animal which is part of you and vice versa) Ratta was ripped apart from him. From this scene, I gathered that daemons are indeed an essential part of you and if it were lost, it represented your soul or at least an essential part of it. It could be innocence or even hope. Looking into his eyes, it was as if he was already dead. There was no life in them and I almost felt towards his situation.All in all, the movie is a delight for everyone. And even for those, such as myself, who have not read the book, the plot is easy to grasp; slowing sucking you into the magical world of a parallel universe and there are a few. It is an adventure story of sorts; a mixture of Harry Potter, Narnia and Lord of the Rings, where your souls are daemons. Almost makes me wonder, what'd mine be. And in case you were curious, its Erasmus - a jackal daemon.A definite Christmas MUST-SEE! I'm definitely buying the trilogy!",The Golden Compass
554,damonsava,"A good movie, but nowhere near as good as the book",7,1 December 2007,"Having read the book several times and thoroughly enjoyed it, I regarded the movie with the overwhelming fear that it would not live up to the standards set by Pullman's book and the faint hope that it would.Fortunately, I was pleasantly surprised when I saw the movie. The movie is very appealing cinematically (although, in my opinion, the dust-alethiometer sequences are much too overused and become rather boring and irrelevant). For the most part, the world seems to be rather believable and, in a strange sense, almost familiar. There are some cases, however, where it becomes horribly visible that the world around the actors is merely an animation and the illusion that this world is real is shattered momentarily.The action in the movie is very well done and the animated daemons are incorporated well (although they do look as though they were just pasted on the screen). Unfortunately, the battles are filmed in a sweeping style that manages to show all the action, but is not emotionally powerful and doesn't connect you to the characters. The battle between Byrnison and Ragnar, on the other hand, is quite personal and intense and should've served as the example for the rest of the fights.Amazingly, the movie does manage, in a fashion, to capture the book on film but there are many shortcomings. Many things in the movie are less effective unless you've read the book. For example, during the duel Byrnison's limping when both legs are good doesn't seem extraordinary until you learn that bears are supposed to be untrickable. The movie does a good job of putting necessary information into a short space. Unfortunately, to make the book more cinematic, the book was transformed during scriptwriting; which,I suppose, must happen if the book is to be made watchable.In conclusion, the movie is well worth watching with overall good acting (despite some blemishes), quite a creative, artistic style, passable animation, and a decent interpretation of the book. (If you like the movie, read the book; if you like the book, consider seeing the movie)",The Golden Compass
555,sfersfania,Nicole Kidman is the Star,7,1 December 2007,"Fairly fast paced. Visually appealing. There is plenty of drama and hold-your-breath scenes. Could have used a little more character development....but most movies have the same problem. Overall good movie for the family (not necessarily young children though). There is a fair bit of violence, although most of it is the good vs. evil variety. Didn't really notice any actual gore.....just characters dying in a bloodless fashion. I don't remember any bad language and there is no sexual material either. As usual, the preview had me expecting a bit more from the movie but I wouldn't say it was wholly disappointing. Nicole Kidman was amazing....I think she really made the movie. I left the theater with the feeling that a sequel is probably in the works.",The Golden Compass
556,elaine-orchard,Books are not written to be movies,4,21 July 2008,"I have always been a fan of the Narnia books and now the movies. Even though some people say the Golden Compass is anti-religious, I was still interested in it for the creativity aspect. I love fantasy of any kind and have always wanted to read the book. With the Narnia movies done so well, I was hoping to really enjoy The Golden Compass movie as an accurate translation of the book (to an extent). I'm sad to say the movie makes me want to read the book but not in the good way. With such a strong fan base and so much hype, I was expecting to be blown away. The graphics, costumes, settings, etc were all beautiful and I felt the casting was great. But the movie left me wanting. I felt I am left with more questions than answers. Now I want to read the book to get more answers and experience the story the way it was meant to be told. This was one story that should have stayed off the screen and on paper.",The Golden Compass
557,lorgain,Polar Bears Drink,2,8 December 2007,"I have not read the book. Never heard of the author. I saw this movie because of the previews. I heard about this movie because of the anti-Christian ruckus.The movie had very little story, no character development and no plot. It was boring, and because it had no engaging quality, it was easy to just go with the anti-Christian observations. So for any of you that were wondering what that was all about, here it is: Souls are daemons. Dust is faith and anti-faith. In the movie, the ancestors committed an original evil deed and so they had to believe in the dust --but, the dust can only settle in adults who need the dust. Children don't need dust or something like that. Anything connected with Catholicism is evil. There's even a Vatican city complete with a cheap replicated version of the Sistine Chapel ceiling. All of that is in your face right at the beginning of the movie. The evil pope even looks like the pope. The Golden Compass has three hands. That was never explained so that's probably TGC's version of the Trinity. When a character is killed it goes back to -you guessed it- dust.The evil Catholics just want to separate children from their souls. But they are doing it ""f-o-r t-h-e c-h-i-l-d-r-e-n."" Yikes, for a moment I thought I was watching Bravo. There were some Nazi folks, complete with Dobermans that were aligned the ""Catholics."" And all of this ""action"" was done in the dark, because of course, the bad Christian world was dark.There was no ending. What happened there? Yet, the final scene, when leaving the dark world, the characters were heading for the light. I had no clue where they were heading or why.There was a funny side. The technology in the bad Christian/Catholic world was an illogical mismatch of stuff. There were blimps and at the same time a carriage powered by a Flux Capacitor from Back To The Future. And I think a the first view we see of Kidman is really a man dressed like a woman. But I did understand this one point. Polar bears drink. But when you get them sobered up, they become loyal and powerful allies.",The Golden Compass
558,danzrgurl2000,Fell short of expectations...,3,3 December 2007,"I was so excited to see this movie. I have read all the books and absolutely love them. I think Pullman is ingenious. The material was all there for another epic fantasy film, just waiting for a great director to pick it up...Unfortunately, no such thing happened. I am a little confused as to why Chris Weitz (director of films like American Pie and Down to Earth) was allowed to director this. He was clearly the wrong choice. The movie, which I did not expect to follow the book exactly due to limited time, appeared to make no effort to tell Pullman's wonderful tale through images. The screenplay was poorly written and seemed to be dumbed down for a six year old, yet the movie's rated PG-13. There was no intrigue. It was choppy and fast paced. There was no sense of story development. Characters and scenes were switched around, and a major part of the book was cut out entirely! This makes absolutely no sense to me (especially since the previews for the movie allude to this part that's cut out being in it). Nope. Instead, the movie stops short with a terribly corny scene and forced dialogue, making no effort to hide the fact that the movie is concluding. When seeing a special premiere of this on Dec. 2, I can recall the entire audience letting out a groan as the movie ended (a few viewer's even booed). Even if one had not read the books, as two of my friends who saw the movie with me had not, I believe they would still be utterly disappointed. From a film standpoint, it was very poorly done. There was an exorbitant use of CG, making the movie appear artificial. Every time Lyra went to read the alethiometer, there were some special effects implying Lyra's ability to see things in her mind (because of the alethiometer), which is not how it happens in the book (this being one of many examples). I was hoping that for a movie such as this one, there would be an incredible score to help mount emotions, but I was in for another disappointment. The musical score was dry, flat, and did nothing to enhance viewing. The one thing that I did like about the movie was the choice of Lyra. I thought Dakota Blue Richards did a wonderful job as a newcomer, in a role that demanded several complex emotions. She executed the character perfectly and it's unfortunate that the movie did not match her perfection. Other cast members (Eva Green, Jim Carter, Sam Elliot) did a good job as well, but did not have enough screen time to really be appreciated. As for Kidman and Craig, I was not thrilled with their portrayals of Coulter and Asriel. In the end, I think people who have read and appreciated the books who go see this movie will be overwhelmingly disappointed, and those who have not read the books will be confused and dissatisfied as well. In comparison to films like Narnia, where the director knew how to take the time to produce a work of art with effective dialogue, scenery, musical score, mix of real and CG characters, and storytelling, the Golden Compass (unfortunately) doesn't even hold a candle.",The Golden Compass
559,jacko103,Horrendous,1,6 December 2007,"How the studio that converted the Lord of the Rings trilogy with such brilliance has ruined this book is beyond me. This movie is down there with Godzilla and the other stinkers out there.As a book adaption it is hampered by constant censorship (e.g. The Authority = Catholics in the book) and ENDLESS story changing. I'm willing to bet the person who did the adaption had not read the book because names are wrong, events are switched about, most of the events that actually explain the story are omitted, events are then invented in an attempt to make the film make any sense etc. I now know why they have called it the Golden Compass - it only bears a passing resemblance to the book it was based on.As a film in it's own right it's confusing, poorly written, boring and bears all the hallmarks of being rushed. like Pearl Harbor it is only vaguely redeemed by excellent CGI, but it's more of a consolation than actual redemption.Such a bitter taste in my mouth...",The Golden Compass

I have read the book a few years ago, so basically understood the plot line.Dakato Blue was radiant and a well rounded character. Nicole Kidman played her menacing part well.The landscapes and the sets were impressive. I liked the arctic scenery and the way they had changed some familiar places like Greenwich Naval College into other worldly palaces.I found Sir Ian Mackellan's voice of the bear a bit distracting as I associated his voice with another character in a different film.

Yes great actors, Yes brilliant animation, no they dumbed it down, shortened it, cut the end off hacked it about and rushed it. Was is because they didn't like the real story? did it step on to many peoples toes? Whatever happened to freedom of speech? The story contains subjects such as science and religion and not everyone would understand or like it but come on we are not all morons! and Im old enough to decide for myself what I believe in, and what I watch. I must be another one of those heretic's and need to be burn at the stake for ever picking up those books and reading them. All the boldness and bravery of Phillip Pulman for daring to write such a story has been drained and distorted. Much in the same way War of the Worlds was murdered altho with out the annoying brat.Im Disappointed, I hoped after Lord of the Rings New Line would put the same amount of effort and loyalty to the story but no. I could go through what happens in the film but cant be bothered, maybe all those missing bits are sat on a harddrive somewhere waiting of a tripple X rated DVD version that can only be bought in Amsterdam! Hot tip for new films ditch the computer animation for puppets or a mix of the two for that extra touch of reality. and more than one model for the polar bears in the crowd.

They ended it poorly and the only part of the book they managed to keep faithful to was the panserborne confrontation. i am really terribly disappointed that Philip Pullman allowed for this to happen to such an amazing storyline...nothing was explained properly at all. very poor... the second instalment will make no sense after that ending either!",The Golden Compass
564,larrypearce2,"Better upon the second viewing, though still flawed",9,13 December 2007,"It is so refreshing to see an epic fantasy film adapted from a popular novel that doesn't have a running length with elephantiasis! There is also a surprising minimum of cuteness and whimsy which some viewers have unfortunately misinterpreted as a lack of humor and coldness to the film.Though when I first saw it, I was thrown a bit by the changes Mr. Weitz and company made, I do feel for the most part they did a beautiful job. Kidman's Mrs. Coulter seems more human than the cold remorseless ""Wicked Witch"" character she is in the books. And as for the so called ""watering down"" of the anti-Catholic stuff, I thought it was kind of fun as an audience member to know what the Magistarium was really supposed to be without them spelling it out. In a way, it makes them more mysterious and creepy! Their costumes looked conspicuously clerical and they used the word ""heresy"" throughout the film, so I wasn't terribly outraged nor did I feel they neutered this aspect of the story. The Dark Materials Trilogy has a lot more to offer than just a secular humanist alternative to Narnia or The Rings.Dakota was excellent and if it wasn't for her the entire picture would have fallen apart. I also really liked the kids that played Roger and Billy. I rather liked how it's Billy that Lyra finds in the smoke house sick with his daemon cut away instead of Tony. However, Billy doesn't die as Tony does in the book and since the ""intercized"" daemons are never seen and then eventually freed (as in the book), the audience feels that this is not adequately explained nor fully resolved (though, at the end of the film, Lyra does mention in her quick outline of the sequels monologue that this ""has to be sorted out."")And yes, Iorek Byrnisson (after Lyra of course) was my favorite character in the book and he is great in the film as well. The chronological switch of Iorek's battle with Iofur (er, Ragnar) with the battle at Bolvangar worked well in the film, to my surprise. But, as I also felt in the book, I wish Iorek was in it more.The music score is gorgeous and the design work is perfect. The digital FX are also very subtle and more effective than you'd expect from this type of film.However, I would've liked to have seen more of the Gyptians. The characters of Ma Costa, Lord Faa, and Farder Coram are all really cool characters in the book and in the film they're just used as story pointers. I was also annoyed how they had Serafina Pekkala just appear out of nowhere on the Gyptian boat, start talking to Lyra about her role in the prophesy, and then just fly away again. That was kinda weird. In the book they meet each other in a different and more convincing way.""The Golden Compass"" film isn't perfect. I've seen it 3 times and each time it works a little better. Alas, it doesn't look like the rest of the trilogy will be made. I do think New Line did a crappy job marketing it, and for a viewer not familiar with the books, the film does seem to end rather abruptly. And I guess I'll never understand how or why this film cost more than what it toke to make all three ""Lord of the Rings"" movies especially when TGC is more than a full third shorter than ""The Fellowship"". Ironically, there needs to be some divine intervention if we ever want to see ""The Subtle Knife"" or ""The Amber Spyglass"" on the big screen.But for now, ""The Golden Compass"" is a breath of fresh air after ""Harry Potter And The Whatever of Whatever"" or that cheesy ""Narnia"" rubbish. I just wish they had marketed it differently. ""The Golden Compass"" is not ""Lord of the Rings""! It does a disservice to one of the darkest and most intriguing fantasy films in years. And I can say that as a fan of both LOTR and ""The Golden Compass.""",The Golden Compass

566,andybuckle,disappointing,5,10 December 2007,"The Golden Compass looks like it was made in a hurry to jump on a bandwagon. The novels on which it is based slowly reveal the mysteries of dust and explore the philosophy of free will. In the film it is blurted out in a rambling prologue. So, it gets on with the action. This is nicely handled, in places. The armoured bears are good. McKellen appears to be enjoying himself as Byrnison.However, while the CGI makes good action, it is not used to enhance the characters. In Pullman's novels the actions of the daemons often betrays the feelings of the character. In this film the daemons are bland: more Jar-Jar than Gollum. The book contains fabulous description of layers of meaning behind the alethiometer's symbols, and the skill of interpretation. Weitz took this material and his cop-out was to show us the truth acted out in sparkly images.The actors do their best with the material, Richards does well as Lyra and all the big names in the cast put in a reasonable effort: ultimately, it is the script and direction which are responsible for the failure.

567,Verathalyn,A stunning and spectacular tableau!,9,8 December 2007,"After journeying to see this movie at the local theater, I have already recommended it to anyone and everyone whom has asked me of my opinion concerning this movie in relation to the book. But even if you have not read the book I would still highly suggest doing so, having read all of His Dark Materials Trilogy by Philip Pullman I think that the movie parallel's the book. Moreso then other book-to-movie endeavors. Harry Potter, for example. My only complaints would be that during the movie the CGI effects at points were.. somewhat lax. Also some of the voices playing specific characters didn't seem to fit. Such as Ian McKellen who plays the Panserbjørn or Armoured Bear, Iorek Byrnison, and Freddie Highmore who voiced Pantalaimon. They also left out the factual scene that proved vital to the battle between Iorek Byrnison and Iofur Raknison (Changed to Ragnar Sturlusson in the movie.) Armoured Bears cannot be tricked. In the book young Lyra finds this out when she tries unsuccessfully to hit Iorek with a stick. In any event Iofur (Ragnar.) was not truly an Armoured Bear as he wanted to become human and possess a Dæmon which enabled Iorek to trick/kill him. My last complaint is that they left out one of the largest scenes from the book, from the movie. The ending piece where Lord Asriel tears a hole in the sky, leading to another world. Which I think will most likely be added into the beginning of The Subtle Knife. In conclusion I still hold fast that The Golden Compass was indeed a must-see event. So? Go see it.",The Golden Compass

The symbolism was cut, the characters were flat and lifeless as opposed to full and complex, and the ending that tied the first book together was completely omitted. The mysteries of the plot that made the series such an engaging read were revealed early in the movie, and despite this the plot moved so fast that to someone who has not read the books, the story would be near impossible to follow. The handling of the material are at times overtly child-geared, but at other times--especially during fight scenes--the depictions are so graphic that young children would be scarred. I could go on listing the faults of this movie--for pages and pages--but I won't. To sum up my experience, it was heart-breaking; I left the theater feeling sick and depressed, as if part of my childhood was just crushed under the black boot of Hollywood.

569,namster,"A wondrous fount of discovery, globetrekking, storytelling...",10,8 December 2007,"In short, the movie is excellent. It is a flawed picture, with the most unfortunate knife job of any film in motion picture history, but all things considered it is an excellent picture nonetheless. This parallel Earth is a fount of discovery and globetrekking and storytelling despite having no ending and more surgical cuts to its artistic freedom than the Lakota commercial guy. It's definitely not The Lord of the Rings on any level of ambition and it shouldn't have to be; it's a simpler pleasure. The Philip Pullman readership should be proud to have fanship over the most colorful and intelligent and infernal fantasy series the world has seen -- with a science fiction gloss, post-modern morality, theological jigsaws, and even quantum mechanics. This film will surely get new audiences to the bookstore and provides good value to old fans too.Any misgivings I have with The Golden Compass adaptation stem from cuts made by its studio, and when I say ""cuts"" I mean the kind that makes art bleed internally. This was a knife job for the ages. Newcomer director Chris Weitz -- presumably with a gun to his back -- reluctantly trimmed a nearly 3-hour epic down to 2 hours. Given the awful circumstances in which this movie was created, it really is quite amazing what Chris Weitz managed to salvage. The Golden Compass succeeds surprisingly well for a motion picture that has suffered more physical insults to its body than Jake La Motta. It could be better, but by that same argument it also could be a lot worse. It lacked a lot, but there was no lack of Chris Weitz's respect for the books. It's better to have a nice film that feels half-finished than a finished film that makes no sense.Pacing is the first casualty in these running-time cuts; you will laugh at how fast it throws the story in your face, guaranteed. Weitz is forced to breeze by some of the author's more interesting ideas in his rush to clock in at 2 hours, but he does it in such a way as to make you interested in reading up more about it later, to pick up a book and fork over some money. You say, ""That's an odd idea. How bizarre. I wonder what it could mean! How exciting."" Pullman's mystical concepts stud this universe with mysteries that invite exploration. Yes, a lot of nifty ideas are glossed over in a sweat but Weitz keeps your curiosity on the plate, and that's the biggest fish to fry. Keep it in perspective, you with the kaleidescope eyes.Given that nearly an hour of the film was cut, a lot of subtext from the novel is missing -- but that happens to all adaptations. The important point is that Weitz is a great fan of the books and he kept in more than enough of the story to make a good movie. His love of the books is his greatest asset and those elements that do make it into the film are deftly explained in no time at all. It is frequently argued that between the two of them Peter Jackson is the superior filmmaker, and in many ways they're right: he is. But Weitz's film has a more generous heart owing to the colorful universe that author Philip Pullman paints; he uses daemons to highlight character relationships and gives flesh to his heroine Lyra. A nobody perhaps, but Weitz has sense enough to eschew Jackson's melodrama and just put a heart at the center of his film, simply. It's been argued that the battles in this movie are bereft of danger. Does that matter? I didn't pay ten dollars to watch that fight anyways, I wanted to see the beginnings of an infinitely inventive, shapeshifting, physics-spanning adventure with an atheist bent. In many ways Philip Pullman himself eschews battlefields (our AntiTolkien), prefering to consolidate psychological and intellectual wars. Fans ought to be glad for the faithfulness of Weitz's script to the books. Author Philip Pullman is purring in his comforter as we speak, and for good reason because his brainchild is in good hands.Actress Dakota Blue Richards IS Lyra. It feels as if Weitz cut a hole in the fabric of space-time, found Lyra, pulled her into our world through a window in the other universe, dressed her up in trousers and a T-shirt and passed her off as Dakota Blue Richards. Her lack of any acting experience she more than makes up for with -- as she puts it -- her desire to just ""be"" Lyra. This is a girl happy to be Lyra, happy to play make-believe with her Pantaliamon and to befriend armored bears, and so refreshing in her grasp of the character's tics. She carries the endearing feminism-lite of His Dark Materials to a small measure of apotheosis, with no pomp nor ambition. This child -- almost effortlessly -- makes smoked meat sandwich out of the entire cast of Harry Potter, makes jellied meat out of Mortensen and Bloom, cooks Elijah Wood over a spitting fire.A flawed movie? Absolutely, but one that deserves our respect for the strengths that it does have. And these are important strengths, strengths that are lacking in so-called ""better"" mainstream pictures. I forgive any and all problems with this film translation simply because it is so strong on other points. There's discovery, metaphysical wonder, earnest characterizations, and enough plot to stun a golden monkey in this more-faithful-than-most adaptation. Keep an open mind, there's a lot to love in this movie.Namster",The Golden Compass

The movie does a pretty good job of following the story-line of Book one, but leaves out enough that those who haven't read the books might have a hard time following. Comments of people I heard who were leaving the theater were probably because they didn't realize this was part one of a trilogy.I loved the way the Visuals were done to give a feeling of the times then/now etc.I'm hoping this will turn people on to the books, so that when the next one comes out people will be familiar with the story.

571,morgmadgamer,"Good Film, Shame About the plot holes",7,8 December 2007,"Having read all three of the books prior to this, and the Northern Lights being my favourite of the 3 I looked forward to the film with great anticipation. Although this film has had bad reviews I feel that overall it was a decent film Good Points: The Actors casted to play the parts were all excellent, perfectly suiting their roles (especially Dakota Blue Richards who was exceptional as Lyra). The voice acting from Sir Ian McKellan and Freddie Highmore was good as well The CGI and fight scene between the two bears was very good and though I felt that the film would have worked better as a 12, but the directors did well with what they had to work with. All the battle scenes were well executed. Although the plot had 'holes' in it, the action was fast paced and kept viewers interested an entertained. Bad Points: Unfortunately the plot line driving the film was severely truncated. Although it was obvious from the start that not all of the subplots would fit in the film, I thought that it was crammed in to fit a 2 hour time limit. This film could have definitely done with an extra half an hour to an hour just to give background information and FINISH OFF THE STORY. The Oxford scenes and times with the gyptians were almost completely removed which made the story difficult to understand clearly what was going on. The film also loses the last scene of the film, involving Lyra and Roger when they met Lord Asriel. Overall The Golden Compass is a good film which I would watch again, unfortunately the amount of scenes that were cut out to 'dumb it down' spoil the great effect the film would have had. I really hope that they will bring out a directors cut edition of this as it would be greatly improved.",The Golden Compass
572,kikieldredge-1,I am ashamed of Philip Pullman,1,8 December 2007,"As far as the movie goes, I cannot say that it was exactly terrible. The actors and actresses did a rather good job of portraying the characters they were given. However, the movie was so far astray from what the book represented, that I almost cried with the shame Philip Pullman must be feeling.Considering the fact that Philip Pullman is a highly respected author, with His Dark Materials being one of the best fantasy trilogies of this day and age, I was extremely upset to see that he would have dared to sell the rights to the Northern Lights without being sure they were going to get the story right. Everything is terribly screwed up. Even the chronology is messed up! Why, why can they never, ever make movies as they are in the books?! Its very simple! There was no reason for the screw-ups in chronology and story-line, and yet they did. And for what? To make it more ""general public"" friendly? I think not.Philip Pullman, I am ashamed of you. I love your series, and it was absolutely amazing. You have lost my respect by selling the rights to your series, and f**king it up miserably.",The Golden Compass
573,christian-m-lee,Research shows failure. Entertainment shows disappointing.,1,8 December 2007,"First, I would like to acknowledge that me seeing this movie has not exactly been something that is received warmly by the people closest to me. However, for that I make no apologies. My friends it is that time that we stop showing fear toward an enemy that has already been defeated. God has not called us to be ""mediocre"" Christians. We need to be able to push the envelope some times. It is greatly needed that we get off our high horses and actually stand for the Christ that we all claim to serve. I am convinced that everyone who reads this will indeed be convicted in one way or another. This movie is something that we as Christians have been warned about throughout the bible. God said He will send a disillusion and will harden their hearts. Brothers and sisters I do not write this to offend you. No, I write to ruffle your feathers and anger you to the point where you put aside your ritualistic doings and your traditional nonsense. Now is the time for action and to fight for what we claim. I have seen this movie for the purpose of research and have found it to be a movie that cannot hold its own in the sight of the public. The Golden Compass is a movie based on the book by author Phillip Pullman who is outspoken in his atheistic beliefs. However, he has made a failed challenge toward The Chronicles of Narnia by author C.S. Lewis. Every aspect of the movie is sorely disappointing being that it held up by lies and deception. The fact that the children in the movie have pet demons is one of the biggest lies seen throughout. Demons are not pets and playful creatures their only want and intent is to corrupt our minds and cause us to fall away from God's plans for our lives. It is however interesting that the demons are shown to be limited of power. They cannot settle with their human while he or she is still a child and is still held in their innocence. The demon has to continually shift its appearance until that child has come into adulthood. Bringing it full circle to how sin cannot be accounted for by a child while they are still under the age of innocence. As when they become adults and learn to discern right from wrong. Moreover, this story takes many shots toward the church as a whole making it seem that is an organization meant to suppress all humanity and take away all rights of those who question it. Wrong! The church represents the body Christ in which has been placed here to show the love that Christ has given to us. Unfortunately, we all fall short of the glory of God. All of us, believers and non-believers do wrong and hurt one another no matter the situation. However, it is the grace of God that allows us the salvation of know Christ and His sacrifice for the world. I am no different; in fact I am the last person to claim perfection. I do know however, that His grace and mercy save me. Brothers and sisters don't be afraid to accept the challenge of doing something that everyone else is afraid of because it ""challenges Christianity"" it only makes the enemy want to keep doing it. Also don't be fooled by this movie's intention to promote children to question authority and to believe that demons are something good. It fails and will continue to fail because of the victory of Jesus Christ.",The Golden Compass
574,nomah17,Great Movie But Hollywood Screwed Us Over...,7,9 December 2007,"When I originally saw the previews for the movie I didn't think much of it; it looked like another failed attempt of a fantasy movie that was trying to aspire to Lord Of The Rings, but I was pleasantly surprised by good storytelling and some really interesting ideas (all credit to the books for that, which I haven't read). Visually it's amazing, I loved the execution of many different settings, and it was just pleasing to the eyes. Unlike many other reviewers I don't feel like the movie was rushed; it had a good enough pace to keep everyone locked into it, but not so fast you couldn't understand it; I'm not sure why so many people say they couldn't follow the movie, it's not incredibly complex, if you want a plot you can't follow watch the first Mission Impossible :-P I think a lot of the people who read the books are assuming because a lot was cut out it'd be hard to follow for everyone else, but it's really not bad. Most of the acting was great, Dakota Blue Richards was amazing as a newcomer, or as an experienced actress for that matter; the other performance that really jumped out at me was Nicole Kidman, who I was surprised to see...well acting, and she played the role perfectly; she really scared me with some of her hollow glares and that insincere politeness. Well that's all great so why'd I give it a 7 out of 10? The ending was just terrible and it had Hollywood's greedy, we stopped caring about whether the movie actually has quality a long time ago, ways smeared all over it. Let's start about a million new story lines right near the end of the movie and then cut it off right when you're most interested like someone just shot you in the heart. They don't care they know it'll make you see the sequel, but it's dirty. Hey Hollywood it's not a good idea to cut off stories before they reach their climax, I didn't even read the books and I know the movie never got to the climax. I think this time you went too far and you're gonna throw a lot of people off what I think could have been an epic movie and epic series of movies not up to Lord of the Rings but above Harry Potter quite a bit. So to the people who made the movie, excellent job, and I'm sorry Hollywood, or maybe whoever edited it, will leave people with disappointment at the end because they all needed some new Bentley's.",The Golden Compass

The criticisms of religious dogmatism and theocracy are still there in the dialogue. A great-looking movie, fast-paced, and well-acted, especially by Kidman, Richards, and Elliott. Perhaps more enjoyable for those who have not read any of Pullman's trilogy.

In this case, the Golden Compass novel was much better than the movie because in the movie the story was different.The first part of the Golden Compass went a bit to slowly, the second part with the battle was a bit to quick and the end was incomplete. Also, one really disappointing thing that happened in the movie was that there were no northern lights in the film and many other events were not included.If you have not read the book, than you will think it's an awesome movie. And for those who have read the book, you might think that it was disappointing since they didn't follow the story. But I definitely recommend the book and the movie is worth seeing.",The Golden Compass
577,dancecrazd,"Good movie, but it falls below expectations",7,9 December 2007,"As a devout reader of the His Dark Materials trilogy, I can say I was skeptical coming into the movie. I knew Pullman had a hand in the movie itself, but I did not believe everything would remain true. I was correct in that assumption.A lot of crucial things were removed from the book. Certain events were removed completely, which often set up events for later on in the film (and eventual films). There were many minor things changed as well, but I can tell that those were due to time restraints and being unable to include everything from Pullman's novel.The effects were wonderful overall. The CG, in relation to the creatures, was great. Daemons looked beautiful, the armored bears were terrifying, and the landscapes were dazzling. The witches in the movie were not done well at all, which annoyed me; they became fun to laugh at, rather than something to be amazed by.I had high expectations for the music as well. The trailer music was great. The music in the movie itself was unremarkable. I cannot remember a single standout tune within the film.Character portrayals! This was great. I thought the actors fit their parts well, especially Roger, Lyra, Fardar Coram, and Ms. Coulter. Daniel Craig was good as Lord Asriel, but not nearly as great as I had hoped. Good choices were made in the voice-acting department as well: Ian McKellen was a great Iorek Byrnison (more than I can say for the audiobooks!) and Freddie Highmore did Pan justice.Overall, a good movie. Not nearly as intense as it could have been. The story seemed forced at times, leaving out crucial details that moved the plot forward in the books, while the movie plodded along at a dull pace. And as far as the ending goes, I was disappointed. Many were. That's understandable. We can only hope that if a second movie is released that they make it work.",The Golden Compass

I was expecting a half-rate Narnia and ride-the-coattails film-making, but this beats Narnia hands down, along with most everything else.It stresses integrity and independence foremost, and justice in the sense of how and _why_ loyalty to your ideals translates into personal loyalty and courage in action -- at both a level a child ""gets"", and a level that an adult can appreciate the nuances.The movie is technically well-done also, with convincing polar bears, animal ""souls"", and the Golden Compass itself. I ""feel"" that ""world"" really exists.If I had children old enough to go to the movies, this is one movie I would really want to make a part of their experience.I am told the books are a bit rough on kids, but this movie version is not.

Even though the underlying premise is about free thinkers battling against religion, if you look closer at what is going on it is about free will (the tenet of true religion) against extremism in any form whether it is Religious, Conservative, and yes even Liberal extremism.For those of you (us) that are religious, this is an excellent opportunity to have a discussion with your children about being able to make good and correct choices based on faith (belief) that will help them to continue to follow God and morality.If you have reservations still, do what any responsible adult should do.

580,hallimel,Visual Feast!,8,9 December 2007,"This stunningly beautiful screen version of Philip Pullman's The Golden Compass: His Dark Materials Book I is a must-see for any Pullman fan. I found it as true as possible to the book, given its one hour fifty-eight minute length.As with all adaptations, things I felt were important were omitted; of course, had they been included, the movie would have exceeded five hours, so the exclusions came as no great surprise. Unfortunately, the entire film felt ""rushed,"" with important concepts explained either poorly or far too quickly. But astute viewers will easily pick up on the intended meanings of various elements, and those who don't can simply enjoy the film's beauty.Ian McClellan's voice was instantly recognizable as Iokur Byrnison; what a gift! In fact, the star-packed cast performed splendidly, and the cinematic newcomers delivered equally as well. Even with the frantic pace of the movie, everyone did an excellent job of maintaining the tension which carried the viewer through the film. Great direction, too, I might add.As for the pre-release hype regarding content, I can honestly say I was neither offended nor disappointed. Any reference to religion was removed. Rather, I found that the dialog referred instead to an organization which cloaked its desire for power in false concern for its constituents (now what actual organization would ever do that?), and rather than anti-religion, what was touted was anti-herd mentality. Since I'm anti-organized religion, anti-herd mentality, and pro-free thinking, this was my kind of movie! The script came across as neither patronizing nor placating; it neither bashed people groups nor bowed to pressure. It was straightforward and designed for ALL viewers. Ignore the hype for a change and check it out for yourself. Don't be afraid; it won't bite.And did I mention that witches were portrayed as good instead of evil? Not just good but beautiful, too. Finally - what a bonus!But I have to admit that I was not ready for it to end - literally. The story was, unfortunately, cut short in an ""and-they-lived-happily-ever-after"" kind of sappy ending. An extra fifteen minutes would have not only given them time to finish in a way that remained true to the book, but I believe using the ending from the book would have lured far more viewers to a sequel than sailing off into the sunset (or lack of one). Bad screenwriters, bad, bad, screenwriters; shame on you. Here's hoping there IS a sequel so those folks who don't know they were cheated out of the original ending can find out what REALLY happened to Lyra and Roger.Minor flaws aside, this is a beautifully panoramic, skillfully executed, extremely pleasant way to spend two hours in this particular universe.

581,rokossa,I won't see the sequel,2,10 December 2007,"I was a little bit disappointed by the movie. At first I should admit that the movie is very well realised: there is a great debauchery of SGI inevitable for such a movie like this and people are playing quite well (Nicole Kidman is wonderful as usual !) even if the huge number of characters spinning around at the beginning could give you a powerful headache, the scenario is not too linear despite being sometimes so foreseeable. What made me feel uncomfortable with this movie is that this little girl, (the main character) could just not stop lying, manipulates people and disobey all the time (even if some would say it's for the good cause). And there is too much violence in the movie, too much killing, too much blood for no valuable reason in fact. So this is the main contradiction of the Golden Compass, an asset that permits you to know where is the truth when people are just lying but that asset belongs to one of the greatest liar of the movie. Finally, I felt really angry at the end when looking at my watch I understood that it's too late to see the conclusion of this story at this time and that the production will suggest us to come back next year for a second sequel and certainly a third one cause there is always three sequels in a trilogy.

Unfortunately her superb skills was not enough for me to even stay in the theater until the end of the film (yes, I walked out after more than an hour into the film). The special effects were also amazing. But eye candy and the superb skills of Nicole Kidman were not enough to save the utterly useless story line. I couldn't even begin to tell you where the story started, what it was about or the theme. Lost is a good word that comes to mind in describing the plot.

The outcome I foresee is a generation not only more accepting, but inviting of demons. Stay far far away from this movie! Not only will you have to pay to train your children in this way, but the movie was not even good. It had some OK special effects, but the movie never really seemed to get going.

Other than that, this film was a huge disappointment to me... I'd only recently read the book, and had the story of the book still churning fresh in my mind. So to me, watching the film just annoyed me beyond belief from in so many ways not being true to the story of the book. Yes, there were a few scenes where I could actually recognize the dialog word by word, but then there were also scenes and happenings that were completely different from what they were in the book. It was a different story, somehow. I suppose it wasn't a poor story, it just wasn't what I'd only recently read ! And that was deeply disappointing to me. It was also violently rushed, and I can't imagine those who haven't read the book being able to follow the story or the plot at all.I'm sorry to say that this film just crushed my love for the story - on the big screen that is. I definitely loved the book, and I think I'll stick to the images made in my own head from reading it, rather than to the film that just ruined the story completely...For all of you who have given it a 10, and say it's the best movie ever - I envy you, and wish I could feel the same !!",The Golden Compass

If you are one of those lucky people who can suspend reality when you enter a theater, you are in for a treat. The star and main character of the film is played convincingly by Dakota Blue Richards. Her character Lyra is forced to quickly move in the company of adults after what appears to be a somewhat spoiled and comfortable early childhood. She starts out as a brash youngster teasing her playmates, an uninvolved student who dreams of doing more interesting things, but soon finds herself in predicaments that test her nerve, self-discipline, and creativity. Nicole Kidman is extremely convincing as a ruthless, powerful, seductive member of the elite powers that be. She is hypnotically beautiful and serene at times, her cat-quick intelligence always lurking. Something that especially stood out to me was the gravitas of many of the male character's voices, deep and sonorous. So many things in this movie just grabbed my attention. The cinematography, animation (oh those bears and demons), pacing and acting are superb...and I didn't find it difficult to follow the plot, even though I hadn't read the books. This movie seemed like Jules Verne 2007 with message and more.

I was intrigued and rushed out to check out the author and the series. I managed to finish the first book before the ""Friday 07/12/07"" release date. I'm not sure that was a good idea, but I am glad to have found this series.Judging from some of the comments, we need to put this into perspective. It is my opinion that the biggest problem is simply that the movie is ""FILTERED"" to be a ""PG13"" but it's really a ""CHILDRENS"" movie. If you go see it with the kids and in that mind frame, then it should be pretty good.Unfortunately, in the ""BOOK"" there is ""KILLING"" and the words ""KILL"" and some ""VIOLENSE"" and ""BLOOD"" like when the ""BIG GOOD BEAR"" kills a fellow bear and is exiled, only to return and ""KILL A KING BEAR, RIP OFF HIS JAW, AND EAT OUT HIS HEART"". The list is lengthy as to what was really missing from the movie and I am also to understand that directors had changed more than once during the films production.The decision was obviously made to make this a children's movie, rather than a young adult film so we have to take that for what it is. There is some great CGI work here and the casting is really great. it moves along in typical style for a children's film and thats what it is, a children's film. The first book, in contrast, does not begin like a children's story and most of that book is geared towards a more mature child or young adult. The Author does tone the style down eventually and having read halfway through book 2, it is very much into a children's style of book.I would have liked to see a more mature film release, but I think the studio and the Author are targeting a different market and it should still be very successful.

The term "" daemons "" for one's inner soul does not set well with Christians and I can see where a boycott of children viewers is in order. This was not a fantasy story for children . It was an out and out attack on Christian morality , by trying to get viewers to accept "" Daemons "" and Witches as children's friends . Parents don't be fooled . One of the scenes depicts a bear searching for armor in a Christian church , complete with a cross on the roof and paintings of saints on the building front. The picture would have been acceptable without the underlying message of demons and witches being friendly and helpful to humans . This being a direct contradiction to Christian beliefs.

After seeing the movie, I am very frustrated by the mixed reviews it has received...those reviewers more or less seem ignorant of the books' epic scope and complexity. There are complaints of the movie being ""too rushed"" and ""not having enough character development""...I can agree with this in the basic sense, but that IN NOW WAY should render this movie a failure. It just means that viewers will be intrigued and wanting to know more for the next films, if they are made. It also speaks to the depth of the plot, which has many layers and inevitably takes considerable time to develop. The negative reviews are spoiling the opportunity for those of us that want to see the series as a whole...so please give it a chance! Yes, many questions are left unanswered, but THAT IS THE POINT. The Daemons were wonderful and intriguing, the casting phenomenal, the CGI animation almost perfect minus a couple of moments here or there. Given the complexity of the plot, I think Weitz did a very respectable job in whittling this down to two hours...two hours obviously not being enough time, but since so many movies are criticized for their lengthiness that was an understandable mistake. I think given the chance for the second movie, Weitz will be able to correct many of these mistakes.I also have to mention that I brought my boyfriend to this movie...he HATED Narnia, and is typically a very tough sell, but he was genuinely intrigued and entertained by this film the whole way through. He has never read the books and I think is a good representation of how enjoyable it can be for those who aren't fans of the trilogy.

Of course the complexity of the book is somewhat diluted but what can you expect in a 2 hour film? The religious references (or lack of them) in the film are really not that important as the story is essentially a struggle of good versus evil and it doesn't matter whether this takes the form of a controlling church or a totalitarian government.

594,freak-100,Disappointing,3,18 December 2007,"From the moment I saw the previews of ""The Golden Compass"" I couldn't wait for the movie. I love fantasy and thought this would be a great end off movie for 2007, but I was wrong! Yes, the movie had amazing animations as animation is something i'm always on the lookout for. The animals are so realistic, sometimes I forgot they weren't really there. What bothered me was the storyline! The movie is predictable, boring and I waited for the ""goose bump"" moment like the ones I had in ""The chronicles of Narnia"" but there were none at all! The polar bears were really great, but I also believed that the movie was rushed. Honesly, ""The Golden Compass"" didn't come close to ""Lord of the Rings"" or ""Chronicles of Narnia"".",The Golden Compass
595,kas-randall,The Golden Opportunity Missed,6,18 December 2007,"Oh Calamity!Should be renamed The Golden Opportunity Missed.First off, it's not a BAD film. In fact visually, it's pretty stunning. But it's a children's film, pure and simple. A film for reasonably intelligent children, I grant you, but a children's film nonetheless. Whilst the books are found in the children's section, they are FAR from simply being ""kids books"" - they just happen to be great literature accessible to the young - there's a vast difference. The plus points - the special effects, the acting (in the main), a very promising debut by rookie actress Dakota Blue Richards, the bones of the story remain intact - erm, that's about it. The negatives - primarily the hectic and contrived pace, flashing from scene to scene with no real linkage, and the lack of meat to the bones. A narrative similar to that provided by Jim Carter through the film's website would have been a useful addition, for example), the fact that the film only covers around 2/3rds of the book (fine if they were going to cover that section of the book in depth, but they didn't - the film lasts barely over 1.5 hours and feels exceedingly disjointed - it assumes knowledge of the story I think which is a bad mistake - and I doubt it will inspire new readers of the books). I get the distinct impression that the DVD will contain a far superior director's cut - I just don't understand why the film industry treat the viewer as though they have the attention span of a gnat.As I say, it's not a BAD film - in fact it's a pretty superior kids film - but what a waste of a chance to create something really special.I only hope that either a new director is appointed for the next film/s in the way in which (on a different level) the change of director undoubtedly improved the Potter films, or, if I'm right about the DVD providing a better cut, that the distributors don't rip the next one to shreds.What troubles me so much about The Golden Compass is that the books are so beautifully written and yet they've hardly left a word of dialogue or narrative untarnished. The stage adaptation done in London was SO much better - and cost a pittance - as was the BBC Radio 4 dramatisation. Nicole Kidman, Daniel Craig, Sam Elliott, Derek Jacobi, Tom Courtenay, Jim Carter (a brilliant and much under-rated actor in the same mould as Pete Postlethwaite) and terrific newcomer Dakota Blue Richards all showed enough in this film to confirm they were up to the job - (Eva Green as Serafina Pekkala maybe not however) but their talents have been largely wasted.If Pullman blindly defends this film in its current state, I'll be deeply disappointed.",The Golden Compass
596,meaghan-19,"Oh, what a huge disappointment.",1,18 December 2007,"Having been a huge fan of the trilogy for many years I was understandably excited by the advent of a huge CGI extravaganza which would hopefully do justice to the story. I don't think I have ever been so disappointed in a movie in my life. From the very moment that ridiculous spoiler of a prologue began I knew I was in for a disaster, and everything just went downhill from there.The story was mutilated beyond recognition, the beautifully written characters and subtle social commentary of Philip Pullman were glazed over and hacked out of the way in favor of slapdash plot adaptations and unabashed bowing down to the Gods of CGI. I like CGI, I feel that it allows movies to explore fantastical stories in an amazing way, I just don't feel that story should come second to effects. Not to mention the fact that trying to tell this story in 1 1/2 hours is like trying to read the LOTR trilogy in a day - painful, somewhat mind- numbing, and you miss way more than you should. I was sorely disappointed, and if the same team puts up an offering of ""The Subtle Knife"" I will not go to see it. I might watch it on DVD to see if they've figured out how not to torture a story. then again, I might just reread the book. That is infinitely more enjoyable and won't cost me anything. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, even if they haven't read the books.",The Golden Compass
597,olivosz,Golden Compass fails to strike Gold,10,20 December 2007,"Not entirely ready to condemn the film altogether, I certainly found it difficult not to shout in frustration as the movie ended in a manner completely contrary to the book. Anyone who has actually read the books knows that their endings are never bright and hopeful, which upset those particular movie goers. As with almost every fan, I found flaws and differences from the book in the movie that were like little nicks to my patience over the course of the film, but I expected this. Anyone who read the Potter Books, or Narnia before watching their film versions could say the same, but bearing through the frustration, I understood the movie, even if I didn't necessarily like it.Then, there is the potential audience that has not read the books, and who remain utterly confused as Weisz crams theories and explanations of any remotely original concept of the series into a five-minute summery at the beginning of the film (with an impeccably horrible voice-over.) The fact that Craig played Asriel remarkably well could not carry through, though, and his character was hollowed out to make the movie appealing to children, and the plot twist that defines his character was not reached by the end. I don't even know if they are making a Subtle Knife or not, but I watched the previews expecting some closure, and having the movie end with Lyra flying into the light of the Northern Lights is a bogus, cliff-hanger ending that I found to be salt in the wound that sent it over the edge. Really, were it not for this bit, I'd be fine to give the movie an A-.Then again, as soon as I left the theater, I realized I had gone the entire movie reliving the boyish excitement I had felt as I read the books the first time, lost in the fantasy. In that regard, I found it successful. It held my interest. Unfortunately, I also served as the human thesaurus for the group of friend I saw it with. The film is good, and I personally found Ian Macellen's performance flawless, exactly as I pictured the character in my mind. I found that when I relaxed, and watched the movie passively, I could enjoy it, but it will be incredibly confusing to a newcomer. It wasn't great, but it's some good eye-candy, and I'm fine with reliving one of my favorite childhood fantasies in any manner, no matter how much fault I might find with it.",The Golden Compass
598,HersheyKissGirlz,Golden Compass: Is it really Golden or just Silver?,10,22 December 2007,"I absolutely loved this entire movie. I have heard it is confusing but it really depends on the person. My friends and I went to go see it and loved it. We completely understood it and, while i have read the books, my friends haven't. However my parents did think it was confusing. They didn't understand the whole ""Dust"" concept which is understandable. The special effects were amazing, however, and all the characters, except for Mrs. Coulter, were cast wonderfully.I did not like Mrs. Coulter, cus she is black-haired, not blonde and i dunno......wilder-looking, fierce, untameable. She acted her very well though, i just could never feel or see her as Mrs. Coulter.Dakota Blue Richards, on the other hand, was amazing as Lyra. Ohmigod i loved her. She made me a fan and she will definitely be around for a long time! She had the sass and innocence I pictured in Lyra and looked like her too! I also love that name, Lyra. It's my new favorite name along with Eragon. I loved Freddie Highmore as her daemon as well. They made a great pair and the daemon itself was very likable.The other characters were great (especially Lee Scorseby) and did the book well.The other problem I had was the ending. It ended in the completely wrong place. There should have been at least fifteen minutes more for a very important part. I guess I could understand that they did that because it ended so if the movie was a flop they wouldn't really need a sequel, but I still didn't like it.All in all, I thought this was an amazingly done and very great movie. It is definitely ""golden."" I hope this comment helped you appreciate the movie or at least go see it.",The Golden Compass
599,assasinomatron,Horrible Movie,3,25 December 2007,"This film is one of the worst I've ever seen. I can't think of another film that has had so much hype that has turned out to be so bad. Let's start at the beginning. I went to the theater with mixed emotions about the film, considering the fact that I'm Christian and all the negative criticism going around about this film in the religious community. Still, I went in with an open mind, hoping to be pleasantly surprised. No such luck. I found the storyline to be dull at the best of times, atrocious at the worst. I found the entire plot to be completely clichéd to the genre, and honestly, I think it's basically just a ripoff of ""The Chronicles of Narnia."" That's really ironic, because the author of the original trilogy hated those books. I do admit, there was a bit of originality with the whole spirit creature thing, but still, it barely advances further than your average relationship with a pet. Still, points for originality. Other than that, there are no other redeeming qualities from the storyline. The acting is second rate. I'll just say it. Daniel Craig and Nicole Kidman have really taken a step down in their careers, which have been stellar thus far. I won't get into the acting of Dakota Blue Richards. OK, I guess I will. I'll go back to the whole Narnia thing. The child-actors in Narnia did such a better job than Ms Richards as far as realism and believability. The only thing that keeps me from rating this film 1 out of 10 is the cinematography. The effects were good, but not great, so I won't award too many points on this front. However, they weren't terrible either, so I'll tack on that 3 out of 10 just for that. Woopee! Don't see this film. It's a waste of money.",The Golden Compass
600,declan-macmanus,The Golden Compass,6,23 February 2008,"Well this years Hollywood scavenging and plunder of our favourite books is out in your local googleplex this weekend. And I must say, I'm rather anxious about this one...Now I loved Lord of the Rings, Pete Jackson, although unable to edit a film to an acceptable time, really put heart and soul into Tolkien's classic. Unfortunately, Narnia could have done with a little Magic and less polish. Not that it did it too much harm. But why do I feel like they leave me somewhat... under-nourished? From the looks of the trailer, The Golden Compass is more polished than Narnia yet I still hold out hope, as I'm a big fan of the books. I mean, how bad can it be... Daniel Craig as Lord Asriel, Nicola Kidman as Mrs Coulter, Sam Elliott as Lee Scoresby, there's even a turn by Gndalf (Ian McKellen) as the voice of Iorek Byrnison.After watching it... I'm still not sure...I know, a bit of a let down, but I just can't weigh it up. Despite the polished look - I mean, anyone would think no one had made Star Wars - all of the elements are there. Although they've toned down the Atheistic storyline (which doesn't take full swing until later in the trilogy) it is still there for those who can think for themselves.Mrs Coulter was played fantastically be Kidman, who pulled the role off with both the sickly beauty and hidden malice the character in the book emanates. Daniel Craig brings an amount of heroism to Lord Asriel, which is unfortunate that he is not in the movie that much.But best of all is Iorek Byrnison as the token talking CGI effect, like some anti-Aslan the lion. Aslan in Narnia is all noble and wise. Iorek is a polar bear that drinks whiskey from a dirty bucket and wears armour in war. One cool bear...But overall, the film appeared to be missing something. I've not read the books in some six years, so I'm not sure if their were anything important missing. But the action moves from one scene to the next at an extraordinary pace, leaving your head spinning. Literally, blink and you will miss a scene link.The main issue I have with the film is the wuss-out at the end. The book has an ending both shocking and necessary for the next book. However, the film holds back for less shocking end (don't get me wrong, still a cliff hanger) and ties things up a little nicer.I'm led to believe, the scenes for the end of the film were shot. However, they opted to leave them for the beginning of the second film, if one should be made. But from the performance of this film, I'm not sure if there will be one... Or even if there should...A pleasing but under-nourished 6 out of 10 starr*'s (I so wanted to give this the Five the book deserves, but alas Hollywood just don't make them like they should) My advice, go buy the books...",The Golden Compass
601,gidjon,The Golden What?,2,29 December 2007,"I went into this film with low expectations, it must be said, but I came out furious. I can not imagine a worse way to ruin Pullman's quite wonderful story with this trash. The first thing that infuriated me was the title. The book is called ""The Northern Lights"", that is ALL it is called, ""The Golden Compass"" is some rubbish invented in America (yes, I do know the history behind that name). That was point number one.The second thing was the script; beyond awful is how I would describe it. It was rushed and lacked drama to the extent that any dramatic scenes were laughable. In addition to this was the horrendous destruction of the actual story: not only did they put it in the wrong order and miss out a vital ending, but they also skipped through some of the more important points (you can't trick a bear, Grumman's head) and as if this weren't enough they dumbed down the political and anti-religious content completely (although these are more prevalent in the subsequent novels).My third issue with this film was the direction (and, by proxy, the production) which was poor at best. Line shot after line shot, constant zooming in on the speaker's face, then switching to the next face, which speaks, then switching back to the first face. Film-making of this quality isn't worth the space it occupies, it is tedious and unimaginative.If there was one good thing that came out of this film, it was that they had some rather good artists working on the effects side, and I have some respect for them, but as far as the director, producer and script writers go, they should be banned from ever touching another film again.I'm afraid to say that even the acting was poor, even from the better actors such as Daniel Craig and Nicole Kidman.As a final point, this film was to the book the equivalent of a particularly nasty disfigurement and was an excellent showcase of special effects, and nothing else. Even the action scenes were poor beyond belief, I'm surprised that Pullman (who I had a lot of respect for) endorsed this abomination.",The Golden Compass
602,mail-4798,A poor adaptation,6,29 December 2007,"I knew what to expect and yet I was still left with a rather empty feeling after seeing this.First things first, the positives: it was beautifully shot. I loved the daemons and the bears, the scenery was stunning and the casting was on the whole pretty solid. I was particularly pleased with Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig who I feel just 'got' their characters.But beyond that it was shallow, unsatisfying and bore little resemblance to the book.I understand that films cannot be an exact representation of a book and I will accept details being changed in order to condense the story as long as it doesn't affect the overall atmosphere or feel of the tale.But in this case I was so furious about the changes being made I'm not sure where to start.One of the biggest problems was, as several people here have pointed out, the complete desecration of Pullman's 'drip feed' technique. To have a narrative at the beginning which explains 'Dust' and introduces the idea of parallel universes, removes all the suspense and makes the rest of the film very clunky.Then there are the 'little' editorial changes here and there: removing Tony Makarios and making Billy Costa the one who has his daemon cut away; introducing a completely new character from the Magisterium to do the attempted poisoning of Lord Asriel and having the Master clearly a good guy from the start, rather than having the confusion of him maybe being a bad guy; having Lyra spend most of the film not knowing about her parents until Mrs Coulter tells her near the end.Buy by far my biggest gripe is the seemingly random decision to change the sequence of events.In the book, for those who haven't read it, when Lyra is kidnapped in the north she is taken to Bolvangar. There, she releases the children and Iorek and the Gyptians help fight the Tartars. She's then kidnapped again and taken to the Bear Palace, where she manages to overthrow the king. Iorek then takes her to meet her father, who runs off with Roger. Iorek takes Lyra to save him but must turn back when he can't cross the ice bridge. She proceeds alone but is unable to save Roger - and after his death realises she cannot go home, and must continue her journey in order to stop her father.In the film of course, she goes to the Bear Palace first. Iorek then takes her to Bolvangar, but can't take her all of the way because of the ice bridge. But then he still somehow manages to appear to help fight the tartars. And during the fight, surely if he was the bear King by then, he would have brought all the bears to help in the fight? He doesn't in the book because he's still an outcast.Then to end the film without completing the story, but with Lyra already realising what lies ahead, is ridiculous. She is an innocent child, and it takes the death of her best friend to realise the enormity of the task ahead.All in all a disappointing 114 minutes for anyone who's a fan of the excellent books - for me it served mainly to remind me quite how good the books are.For those who haven't read the books, I suspect it will also be unsatisfying. Many things were not properly explained - such as the prophecy which is mentioned several times but never explained in full.",The Golden Compass
603,judgedredd8,"Okay film, so much wasted potential though.",6,10 January 2008,"I wish the verdict on this film wasn't as simple as ""They cut out religion, they ruined the film"". But in many ways, that is the biggest flaw.Religion plays a MAJOR part in the Dark Material trilogy. Taking it out of the story is like ripping out part of its soul. Its like removing all references to angels from Paradise Lost. How are they planning to keep the second and especially third films politically correct? They kill freaking God! A very very bad call, in my opinion.The script was terribly written. It felt as if someone actually went through the book with a black marker pen, and crossed out the unwanted parts, in one case even mid-sentence. For some stupid stupid reason they decided to remove the entire ending of the book? Where the hell is Lord Asriel's morally questionable sacrifice? Where is the damn portal between worlds??? I felt that removing that rendered the whole film pretty much pointless.While the director, editor and scriptwriter deserve to be unemployed for a decade or so, due to the way they butchered the storyline, the special effects and set and costume design guys all deserve gold stars. The film looks amazing, and feels so so real. I fell in love with the Airships and the panorama of London. The special effects were great, although I wish they dropped one of the Alethiometer CGI scenes. They could have spent the money on something else, and no one really wants to see the same sequence for the third time.As far as acting goes, congratulations on finding a good child actor. Dakota Blue Richards really surprised me, in a good way. She definitely outshone Nicole Kidman, who despite pulling off the dinner scene at Jordan's quite well, was quite terrible throughout the rest of the film. The phrase wooden acting comes to mind. There wasn't really enough Daniel Craig or Eva Green, but what there was showed their talent well.All in all, if they decided to keep the religion and properly transform the book into a film, this could have been one of my favorite films of 2007. But they messed up, bad. Hopefully someone will re-make it in two decades or so. Without Nicole Kidman. And with the plot put back in.",The Golden Compass
604,b-rae-jones,Why did I bother going to watch this film?,1,31 December 2007,"Having already read Pullman's Dark materials trilogy, I was understandably excited to hear that Northern Lights was being made into a film., however, I think should have been more suspicious about it being renamed ""The Golden Compass"". Despite that I still went to see it and I can't remember that last time I have been more disappointed by a film.Before I went to see it, I reminded myself that certain aspects of the story may be left out, as they were in the LOR trilogy, but I was not prepared for great swaths to be dismissed. Nor could be understand why it was deemed necessary for the huge amount of ""dumbing down""; and this started within the first minute. Was the introduction to aspects of the second book and what a daemon is needed? No. Equally unnecessary as plastering a huge gold letter ""M"" on anything that was connected to the ""Magisterium"". I understand that the book was for Children primarily, but punctuating Lyra's first three attempts at reading the Alethiometer (yes, that's what it's called, NOT the Golden compass) with a gaudy representation of what she was ""seeing"" was completely pointless. However, I sure it will further emphasize the ""Golden Compass"" which will be terrific for merchandising  as if being shown at Christmas was not enough.So after I resigned myself to chapters being missed out and the altered chronology I decided to take in the acting, sets and CGI. Five minutes later I was glad it wasn't me that paid for the cinema tickets! Despite the impressive cast, the acting was wooden and lack luster. The characters which were so full of life and attitude in the book were flattened to one dimensional props. Make way for the fantastic CGI? Nope. Nowhere near the standard required, with cartoonish caricature faces for the daemons and far too much reliance on swirling gold dust.Now looking at my watch I see there's only a couple of minutes of the film left. I think ""How on earth are they going to fit in..."" And as the credits roll I understand. They're not going to put in the ending of the book. Much better to leave the film on some attempt at a cliffhanger to try and pull the punters in for the next movie  possibly to be called ""The Shiny Silver Cutting Thing""?. I for one will be going to see it, but only to poke fun at it.",The Golden Compass

When I saw it I was disappointed at the very beginning where Serafina Pekkala tell's you what dust is while in the books its like a mystery and you get little clues and you think you vaguely know. THIS BIT CONTAINS SPOILERS: They filmed it so it fitted into its two hour slot, so they missed out the ending, possibly the most important bit where Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig) kills Roeger, and they also missed out THE DINNER PARTY which may seem like a minor scene but if you have read all the books it introduces characters to Lyra and the reader, these characters are incredibly main and set up the plot for all three books, they also made it less anti-religious and personally I do not believe in God but do respect all religions but the books are around killing god and how he's this evil character and his angels are also evil.All in all i hope they don't make the next two movies after the mess they made of the last, if you don't agree this is my opinion and i welcome any comments.

608,resli-1,A Decent Adventure,7,12 May 2008,"The ""Lord of the Rings"", and ""Harry Potter"". These two movies are what ""The Golden Compass"" reminded me of. The Golden Compass is a fantasy adventure movie which does stand on its own with these two other movies. It features an array of decent actors, who both have ups and downs in the film.The downside to the film is largely the beginning. It introduces the movie's concept of dust, something that is normal in everyday life for us, is in the film, a dimensional material. Therefore, the beginning is very confusing, and the story does not develop until well into twenty minutes of the film.After the rocky start, the film is quite well done. The CG is exceptional, such as the polar bear fight. Another thing that drew me into the plot was the introduction of new characters along the way. The movie begins with the protagonist by herself, but as the story continues, she begins to incorporate new allies into her group. The introduction of characters made me want to keep watching.There are decent fight scenes, a main one being the Polar Bear fight. The finishing blow was nicely executed. However, the ending fight scene of the movie left me disappointed. There was no organization, nothing that really drew me into the fight. With a brawl of over a hundred people, lacking variety of attacks and CG makes it dull and quite irritating.Finally, if you like a movie that focuses more on adventure and development of characters, with a nice integration of CG, I suggest watching the film. It is a good one time movie, and hopefully a sequel is created. =]",The Golden Compass
609,rareb82,Confused as a non-reader,4,23 December 2007,"Many people have told me to read the books. Especially, after I became involved with the Lord of the Rings fandom. I even know some who said that His Dark Materials is even better than LotR. I've never come to read them, basically because my local library didn't have the Northern Lights, only the second and the third book and I didn't want to take the chance again to buy another first book of a trilogy without knowing it.Now, I've seen the movie by chance (a friend I hadn't seen in a long time wanted to watch it and I went with him because of him rather than the movie) and it didn't make me curious about the books behind it at all. This statement alone is proof enough for me that the film is poorly done.If you see a good movie, one that touches you in a way, one that makes you feel with the characters and the world it plays in, you want to know as much about them as you can find out. This isn't just something that happens with fantasy movies, even good romantic comedies or dramas can have this effect.So, there has been something wrong with the Golden Compass to begin with. It didn't touch me at all. I wouldn't have cried or even been shocked if any character had died at any given moment of the movie. (Well, except the polar bear, he was the only one I had sympathies for.) I simply didn't care. And I've been sitting in my not so comfortable theater seat, mighty comfortable that nothing too bad would happen.I'm very interested in political systems, how power is shared or concentrated and which effects it has on those exercising it and those who have none. I'm allergic to displays of political systems that aren't consistent, that seem to work without reason - even worse when the system is supposedly tyrannic and fascistoid, like alluded in this movie.Where does the power of that magisterium-thing come from? Why are they able to control people? What has all this to do with free will? And why do they want to kill the Daniel-Craig-Character when he supposedly is the only person who could open the door to other universes they could afterwards control as well? There are two completely different goals (kill him and similarly rely on him to discover the way into other universes) I had been very confused by Lyra's apparent lack of... I don't know, common sense? If someone tells you ""I give you something very, very precious. You have to keep it secret. Don't show it to ANYONE"" - would you show it the first person you meet and who is reasonably nice to you? Even after she's found out what the compass does and can do, she's just openly using it in the streets, around people, so that everyone can see she's having it. And what bugged me the most is the fact that it didn't have any negative consequences for her at all. Apparently, she's shown the thing to all the right people, she has never been in any real danger, because you could be sure that even if she did screw up big time... it wouldn't hurt her at all.If I had such a rare and powerful object, I would be a lot more careful with it and I would be a lot more suspicious about people... but maybe it's just me.All the technical aspects in the movie had been fine. I've never seen such realistic animations of polar bears and the like, it had all been very impressive. But impressive effects just aren't enough to make a good movie. I had no problem with the cast, either (I blame it on the script that I didn't care for their characters, not on the people who portray them). It was just very shallow and smelled ""we want to profit from the overall fantasy hype some more"" all over the place.I'm confused whether I should read the books now anyway, because I can't tell whether the huge holes in the plot are movie-made or serious flaws in the original story.I only gave it 4/10 points because the special effects were good and there are worse movies than this one. But it's far from good and can't even dream to compare to the Fellowship of the Ring as a first part of a trilogy.",The Golden Compass

611,antoniow800,It is a very terrible Movie!,8,24 January 2008,"The movie which I dislike the most is The Golden Compass. This movie is very boring and lack of education. Also, it is only suitable for children because this movie is a little bit childish. It is impossible to believe that people's soul can leave the human body and form another stage. In addition, the people can talk with the animals. These things are totally impossible and childish. Un fortunately, there are some scenes which are very bloody. For example, while two polar bears were fighting against each others, suddenly one of the polar bear hit the other one's jaw and the jaw fell off. It was not suitable for children to watch. In this movie, the content of Golden Compass is not very attractive, for example, this movie did not make me feel any excitement and any sad feeling at all. Also, this movie did not show the background of the movie clearly. And the film did not provide detail content for audiences. It disappointed me very much. About the performance of the actors, except the main one 'Nicole Kidman', the other actors gave out a terrible performance. They could not express the right feelings in the film. It made me confuse because I did not know what the exact meaning is. All in all, I am not quite satisfied with this movie. It did not reach my expectation. I felt very disappointed with it.",The Golden Compass
612,michaelnglk,A BIG disappointment,3,24 January 2008,"When I first watched the trailer of this movie, I had a quite high expectation in it. The special effects seemed grand and gorgeous. However, the whole movie could be concluded as a failure.First of all, the length of the movie is too short. Two-hour time is definitely not enough to develop the characters and the whole plot of the story. Though I didn't really read the original novel written by Philip Pullman, I have been told that this movie has missed out much important content. As a result, I could hardly understand the story.Moreover, the adventure of the main character is another big disappointment. The adventure seems so smooth that it is not exciting at all. In another words, it is quite a boring movie. Talking more about the plot, many parts are quite ridiculous, like how can the main character know how to use the ""golden compass""? Why everyone has a spiritual animal? Why ""dust"" is always mentioned? There is no explanation to these questions and how can we, the audience understand the plot? I'm just in total confusion after watching this movie.In conclusion, the movie is not well developed. My last advice is that you'd better save your time and money and don't watch this movie.",The Golden Compass
613,marx_ajay2-1,Hi! Great Movie,10,25 January 2008,"Okay. I know I'm going around on different websites about the golden compass and posting my comments like I'm a mad clown, but I really really really liked this movie. It was very exciting and I also agree when the movie ended, I wanted to see more of it. I'm not much of a movie person, but this one was REALLY good.The casting was great too, with Daniel Craig, Nicole Kidman, and Christopher Lee (who is going to be 90 years old by the time the amber spyglass comes out. Incredible that he is still doing movies at the age of 85, even though he was barely in the movie).Dakota Blue was awesome as Lyra. She is almost in every scene. She is very good for a first time actress especially since she got the main character the very first time. (It seemed like it would be very pressuring playing the lead role the first time you act in a movie. The way the movie played out depended heavily on Dakota blue's acting of Lyra. She really did awesome).I really really hope they make Lyra part 2 and Lyra part 3. That would be really exciting. I can't wait to see them. (I doubt that the people who make the decisions to make Lyra part 2 and Lyra part 3 will go here and read these posts, but just in case they do. Pretty pretty pretty pleeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaasssssssssssssssssssseeeeeeeeee make movies 2 and 3.",The Golden Compass
614,alainlalonde41,Nice Answer To The Chronicles Of Narnia,8,28 January 2008,"Nice seamless delivery of a bookish linear tale. Much to the profit of enriching the substantive elements of a serious lucid work of symbolism meant to show God is not the sole proprietor of every symbolizing form; further enforced by a magnificent production of sense and gravity without ever going over the line of violence, politics or geopolitical overtones. The author of this book has as a religious point of view atheist. As such he has delivered a obvious recuperation of the wonders all around us. To enjoy this film it is best to consider his point of view as an objective to achieve expression of his view, and then if you will contrast the views of religion in order to appreciate the respect by which he has treated the subject. It is all positive and there is no religion bashing here, just simple good sense.",The Golden Compass
615,ljb_smith,Don't bother...,1,9 February 2008,"From start to finish, this film is a disaster. I say that because the book ""Northern Lights"" is my favourite book. It's incredible, and no matter what your view is on this film, please read the book ! The film bears no real resemblance of the book - everything is the wrong way round and all the characters don't depict the actual characters from the book very well. Asides the fact that they dropped the last few chapters, there was no real passion in this film. I don't understand why they have all this amazing technology to show animation and real filming side by side, and yet this film looked beyond fake ! Peter Jackson should have done this film - he knows how to create a film with real passion and understanding of a complex book with unusual characters and settings. People have Daemons - it's an incredible perception on a visual way of a human soul and yet they exist in the film as if it's completely normal. I nearly walked out of this film I was so disappointed in it. Please please, if you haven't seen the film, read the book first. I can't emphasize this enough. They've dummed down the complexity of this film - I understand they had to to a certain extent, but it meant it lost every meaning of this journey all the characters are on. I think part of the problem as well was the script - a lot of the book is based on visual, so it meant a script had to be made up a lot. I don't think Chris Weitz has the ability to move from American Pie / About a Boy to a fantastical film. As a majorly passionate person about fantasy films, I know what is possible to do with both animation and humans, and how emotion can be shown really well on screen. This film misses every single opportunity to be passionate, thrilling and inspiring. A true flop and if they make the next 2 books ""The Subtle Knife"" and ""The Amber SpyGlass"", I can't be responsible for my actions towards New Line Cinema !!!!!",The Golden Compass
616,mdelio-1,Doesn't follow the book at all....disappointed!,5,16 February 2008,"Having read The Golden Compass and the two other books in the Dark Materials Trilogy, I was disappointed at how far from the book the movie was. It's as if the producers decided to pick the most visually exciting parts of the story and write their own version loosely based on the book's plot. This is a series of books that could, or perhaps should, be given the same reverence as Peter Jackson's masterful telling of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Philip Pullman creates a whole world that one has to be immersed in totally to appreciate the tale, as one had to do with J.R.R. Tolkein's Middle Earth. The movie is indeed rushed and not finished as it should be. I'm not surprised though, since with the recent rush of fantasy movies to come out and attempt to bask in the afterglow of the success of films such as the Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, there are bound to be some real lemons which in this case is a real shame. Maybe if the other two books are put together as sequels to the first movie they may be able to salvage the plot and pay better homage to the written story.",The Golden Compass
617,jtafur070487,Had so much potential until the NewLine got its hands on it,8,17 February 2008,"Having read the books I was really excited to see the movie. I loved the acting (Nicole Kidman was awesome!) and effects but the way they chopped the story up was disappointing. Judging from the comments left on the first few pages here, the studio made a big mistake and I hope they learn from it.Anybody who read the books is disappointed by what's missing. And anybody who hasn't read the books seems just confused by what's missing. Since this was the reason for changing the book, to appeal to a larger audience, nobody wins here. I hope that the next movie is more true to the book. It was the gradual character development and discovery of the parallel worlds that made this story so captivating to begin with. So yes this is going to be a bit controversial as ultimate goal in His Dark Materials is to kill God but that's what made this so great: that it challenged the norm. Besides, a little controversy never hurt anybody's wallet, if anything its free advertising so I don't know why the studio chickened out so bad. It's not like those religious conservatives were really going to take their kids to see it regardless what they did to it. Ending the movie early was just plain wrong. It was this sad but suspenseful ending in the first book that made me ransack all the public libraries in the twin cities metro area for the next book that very same day just to find out what happens to Lyra. I imagine that the movie could have made the audience anticipate the sequel in much the same way if it had been true to the books. Why do we always have to have a ""feel-good"" ending? I hope that when it comes out on DVD that they include an extended version of the film. They filmed it all and put it together, but in the end the studio opted to Disney-fy it after pre-screening it. tsk tsk. Bottom Line: They need a more experienced director that can actually handle the pressure of working with controversy and such great resources as was the case here with the cast. They needed to make this longer. Like I said,half the fun of the books was discovering things as Lyra did. And theyneed to have more guts. If they didn't want to get involved in the pseudo-controversy surrounding the subject matter of His Dark Materials then they should have left the books to a studio that actually had some balls. Truly they have underestimated their audience and I hope the next film remedies this.Inaccuracies aside, its a great film. Great cast, good effects (Iorek was well done!), and it still managed to capture some of the fun of the books. I don't have the heart to give it any less than 8.",The Golden Compass
618,davidevans1985,A disgrace to the books,1,21 March 2008,"I'm an incredibly big fan of the trilogy ""His Dark Materials"" and I can safely say that if you are too, you will want stay away from this movie. While it essentially follows the general plot of the book, it has captured nothing of the original magic of the books and has changed a ridiculous amount for no apparent reason. I can understand missing bits out due to time restrictions, but the movie has completely ripped the book up and then sellotaped it together in a mix mash of the original plot. Not only that but it is incredibly dumbed down, probably to suit the audience.I could go on detailing the failings of what could a have been an excellent movie, but I think that Luke Ewing has said pretty much everything I feel. I highly recommend that you save any money from going to the cinema and buy the books. You'll soon understand why we are so annoyed with this joke of a movie.I'm just glad I didn't waste any of my money to see this utter rubbish. If I were Philip Pullman, I would have shot myself just so I can spin in my grave!",The Golden Compass
619,greenbud272,Butchered,1,19 April 2008,"I was looking forward to this movie for awhile now cause I am a fan of the books. I'm not one of those ""the book was better"" people. I know that a making a movie is a lot different than writing a novel. Most of the books that I have read that later became movies I really enjoyed, all the Harry Potter series so far and of course the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Hell even the Bourne trilogy which was completely different on screen than the books. Never the less I liked them all. So saying all this first just to let you know of my honest opinion of the adaption and the movie both.This movie was by far the worst adaptation from book to movie. Its like they stole the characters names and threw away their hearts and souls and meaning and purpose. The remake was mangled and poorly written. It was really short and it didn't need to be. The scenes were butchered and sliced leaving you no connection with the characters. No development at all. Like a ""GET IN GET OUT"" operation. Even if I hadn't read the books first I wouldn't have liked the movie at all. Well maybe a little but thats just because of the eye candy. I think if I was Philip Pullman I'd be pretty upset at the movie. Of course I'm sure he got a BIG FAT CHECK out of the deal to help him get over it.I'm not the type that says ""DON'T WATCH THIS TURD!"" Watch it, I hope you like the film and if you haven't read the books you should. It's all your call. I sure hope the next two movies aren't so butchered. I don't normally right reviews or comments on movies but I felt so robbed and empty after watching this one I had to vent some how. I hope you're happy Chris Weitz, ASS!",The Golden Compass
620,texaspuppy,"If you haven't read the book, it won't make a lot of sense.",5,8 May 2008,"I really wanted to see this movie in the theatres. A great cast namely Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig as well as stunning visual effects were drawing me to see this movie. But alas, I missed it. Yet I heard nothing from friends or family or work mates or from anyone for that matter that had actually seen this movie. But no one talking about it meant no one said a bad word about it.Then the DVD/Blu-ray hype. I once again was compelled to see this movie. I was waiting for the Blu-ray version to be available at my local video store, but it would always be out. So DVD it was.The storyline seemed to progress very fast, leading me confused right off the bat hoping that the storyline would unfold and reveal important pieces to the movie later on. But no. It left me with tons of questions that I don't want to wait for another movie to explain especially not knowing if it will at all.Why was this girl so important? Why did everyone else know why she was important except for the audience (novel readers excluded)? Why were Lyra's parents estranged yet they were right in front of her all this time? How could this girl read the compass with a mere vague interpretation of the symbols? Why did Lyra say she came to the ice bear kings lair to be his daemon (a ruse I know) yet she didn't come of her own free will? She was captured and dragged there.The irrelevant ice bear duel.Why were the kids in captivity? Why did they want them to grow up by taking away their daemons? Why was Daniel Craig's character cut out of most of the movie? Why didn't they just make this movie just a little longer to explain what the heck was going on? This could have been an epic tale told by an epic movie in the wake of Lord Of The Rings, but it certainly was far too short to deliver. I have never read the book, but I cannot believe that the novel would be this clumsy. It's obvious the director had a disjointed vision. The set up in the beginning could have been a little longer. No one's roll was properly developed, along with their ""religion"" of sorts. There were little irrelevant or at least underdeveloped stories along the way. And questions questions questions.The sets and the style of the movie were excellent. Great CG shots and I loved the integration of old and future technology. The costumes were great yet Nicole Kidman's costumes in some cases were not flattering (ie. bottom half of the gold dress). And the acting was what to be expected with this cast: great. That Dakota is a rising star to say the least. It's a shame kids like this don't get first billing and have to be billed second or later after their more seasoned actors with smaller parts. Maybe it was deserved in this movie next to Nicole Kidman, but I hope she gets what she deserves in upcoming movies. (The other Dakota always seems to have take second chair) I probably will see the next movie if the enticement is adequate, but not in the theatres for sure.PS Why did the the boy go with Lyra at the end of the movie to find Lord Asriel without telling his mother after being missing/abducted for so long?",The Golden Compass

The ending was wrong, the timing of events was way off and some of the character's stories were different. I understand that some things must be changed or omitted when a book becomes a movie but this is a travesty. This story was mutilated. Read the book. In fact I challenge you to read the first book and not be compelled finish the entire ""His Dark Materials"" trilogy. We as the audience need to be more demanding of the filth peddlers in Hollywood and should stop spending our hard earned money on worthless drivel such as this.

622,rrajigar_9,Pretty Good Acting But Horrible Plot line,2,18 May 2008,"I've never read the book, so I really can't compare how good or bad it is comparing both movie and book to one another.Although the CGI and acting were all dandy and fine by my standards, the plot line was just horrifying. It went pretty fast. It should be done slower so we all can catch up and be on the same train.I know there was a lot of anti-Catholic controversy on the movie (daemons connecting with the person's soul), and I have to say it's pretty much true in my own opinion. I am a Catholic myself, and somewhat of an Agnostic, and I practically think this whole daemons thing connecting with the person's soul and whatnot and some other nonsense is ridiculous. In another sense, these ""daemons"" seem to have forms of animals, pointing to the fact that they serve as the personal animal guides belief in the Native American culture; but instead of having the individual keep their animal guide a secret (as to not offend their guide), as in Native American culture, everybody else knows and sees them. Giving them the name ""daemons"" is a mystery and a joke.Actors: A friend told me that the only good thing about The Golden Compass is the talking bear, and I have to say I strongly agree. Ian Mckellan voicing the bear with Lyra is a good pick by the producers. Seeing how Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig's characters turn out to be Lyra's parents was a shock. Daniel Craig had a very limited role in the movie, as we see him get caught but, somehow, we don't see him being held captive through out the rest of the movie. The leopard creature we see him with makes him look awkward.Overall, I pretty much thought this movie was good in a way, but mostly and mainly ridiculous.",The Golden Compass

But as far as I know the magnetic north pole is as far as u can get from Svalbard. The geographic north pole is at the magnetic south pole. Since the ""red"" arrow on a compass is is generally considered to be north, is has to be pointing south, since when it come to magnetism (spelling) opposite attracts. Hence the magnetic north is at the geographic south pole, and that is about as far as you can come from Svalbard.

626,finn-alexander,unfortunately awful film that could of been as good as LOTR,2,7 January 2009,"Firstly i would like to say that Hollywood has ruined one of the greatest children's stories ever written, and the books are easily as good as Tolkein's, and better than the harry potter series.Secondly this film has such a great cast that the film could of been fantastic. Daniel Craig, Eva Green and Nicole Kidman are all good actors and well cast for the roles which they were to portray.Firstly the pros of the film: Great cast, Dakota Blue (whatever her name is), performs very well in a leading role. The Daemons are obviously difficult to portray in a film, however they did well in portraying the film. Lyra's world was well done.However i could not enjoy this film and was angry about the making of it. Story not faithful to book, which i can understand to some point is toned down in its anti-church theme, however the whole story was changed to make it in to a film which should not be even considered in any relation to the book (i would also like to say that when i first read this book, and i have read it a few times, the anti-church theme did not occur to me i just thought it as a truly great story although i was young). The film strays so far from the story of the book that it is effectively a completely new story. The sequels can not be made of that film with reference to the books for many reasons. Because Lyra's aim for the whole of the next 2 books is too gain forgiveness from roger who dies in the book but not in the film. The aim of lord Asriel is to rid all the universes of the first angel(god?). Does Mrs Coulter save Lyra in the film, i can not remember but in the book she saves her and is the start of her redemption. Lyras prophecy according to the witches is that of Eve mother of all intellectual beings as she bites the forbidden fruit and learns good from evil. I imagine that should they make the sequels they will not include the other main protagonist fro the next 2 books,ignore lord Asriel's war, ignore the love story between the children and therefore ignore the whole point of the story.What i can say about the film is that it is not as good as the book, not as good as the play (which is amazing) and if i was Phillip Pullman i would make sure that no rights would be allowed to make the sequels. The only beneficial thing about the fact that this film was such an awful rendition of such a great story is that someone eventually will make a film faithful to the book and watch this film and realise that that ignorant (predominintly American) Christians incapable of judging a story on merit alone will not stop someone making a genuine attempt to make an already brilliant story into a good/great/brilliant film.Film definitely aimed at children. for anyone who has read the books don't watch, for anyone who likes the idea of the film but feel it lacks a story read the books, for anyone else who reads this which i imagine will be few and far between i hope i have not bored you with my rant. peace",The Golden Compass

That being said it was not the actors fault they all did a great job I blame the screenplay. It was rushed I didn't understand the damn dust thing, or why people were fighting over it, I didn't give a bleep about the polar bears which probable feel a lot more honorable in the book. the whole flick was shallow other then lyra saving her friends thats the only damn thing that made sense that i gave a crap about.In short I believe a sequel could save the film just fire the writers.",The Golden Compass

As to most every claim, there are exceptions and have been movies from books that were fantastic! Personally I loved this movie. Yes, I've read the books and completely agree that there were much more magnificent, but that is because when we read we can interpret the story however we like. When a book is turned into a movie, it is simply one group of people's interpretation of that story. Of course it doesn't always fit with our own.

Can you see yourself flying in a ship with a bear that can talk, that is up to you to be a part of. Of course don't forget her daemon. Changing from one little one to another is fun for me. They run away from one type of danger to another only to be saved by a group of people who has been watching and following her from the time she left her sleeping quarters.There are so many good plots and saving of the children that the witches knows of the little one who has the powers to read the golden compass.

631,jonathan_m123,Pullman is to Harry Potter what Harry Potter is to Twilight,8,12 January 2014,"The film is not the book. But His Dark Materials are probably the best children fiction since Narnia; incredibly talented writing; and with tension that puts fear to all ages. The films does a pretty good job of telling the story -the casting is excellent, Daniel Craig and Nicole Kidman are not overpowering and well suited for their roles. The kids are ALL fantastic, but Lyra is striking, believable, and totally fascinating. Literally the only time I questioned the casting was with Ralph Fiennes, I thought Liam Neeson would have been more rugged, but as the film went on I felt very guilty because Neeson would not in fact have been particularly effective with the overall subtlety and morality of the film.Apparently the following films were cancelled under pressure from the Christian right in the USA. Whilst I can see where they might feel threatened, lots of people having related the story line to abuse by Catholic priests etc., this story is not necessarily about them, nor is it (necessarily) entirely ideologically anti-faith, anti-Christian, or particularly political. Its total brilliance is far beyond either of these reductive and reactionary responses. If true, the religious right has shot itself in the foot. A lot of the best children's' stories have dark undertones, often it is what distinguishes anodyne, meaningless, patronising rubbish from great children's fiction like Pullman's work, which is not itself dark or unsuitable for children, but also does not hide or patronise or isolate them.It IS relevant to child abuse, if I had to pick a beginning setting for this narrative, it would be exactly where the film and book are set, British private schools, not a convent or extreme religious institution. My cousin committed suicide because of abuse he received in such schools. Some were strongly Christian, some not particularly, and Christian objectors are perversely narcissistic to see themselves in this story. It is a wonderful fairy tale of coming of age and particularly becoming strong in an abusive system. I respect and love large parts of the Bible, and I think they should be read very carefully to understand and to interpret what they might mean, but I personally feel that, although I'm not a practising Christian, every Christian should see the heart of their religion in Pullman's ""His Dark Materials"" – there is no place in Christianity for the abuse of children, and any institution that might have something to do with it must be illegitimate to a Christian. Pullman's ""Dust"" is the locus around which the subtlety of the story circulates – it is scientific, metaphysical, a material hidden from the young, the powerless or anyone who is outside small academic circles for the purpose of its advantageous exploitation. It is spirit, truth, and it is the reason for many lies.But aside from controversy, the film is entertaining. In parts it good be better edited; it is excellently acted; but the script is brilliant. Why? Because it is a decent adaptation of a work of humane, imaginative brilliance, and Pullman should stay on children's shelves long after J. K. Rowling is forgotten.",The Golden Compass
632,testocules5,When the alethiometer lies to Lyra you know that something is wrong,6,26 February 2011,"Although my rating is absolutely generous for what the movie had to offer, I find myself at a crossroad. I try to grasp what Weitz wanted to accomplish with this movie, and the first answer that comes to mind is an eye candy so pleasing that it almost lures you, tempting you to forget about the bad stuff and blame it on the short amount of time dedicated to the movie. CGI and animation were obviously very strong, perhaps too strong for a book like The Golden Compass which really shined because of the plot and characters in the first place. So why did Weitz put so much weight and resources on the visual aspect? Because it's the first thing your usual spectator sees. And I was thoroughly impressed with how good the daemons looked in comparison to Narnia. The choice of actors was again a strong point of the movie, Eva Green looked great in the alluring role of a witch and Sam Elliott was the best choice for the Texan aeronaut, Lee Scoresby. Most of the actors were a great choice, and they did well with what they had to, but even they did not expect to be hit hard by the avalanche of short scenes glued together that made up this movie.Not only that the plot was butchered with unneeded changes(Such as another person poisoning the Tokay, not the Master), but they actually got the name of a character wrong. Was it that hard to call the bear king Iofur Raknison? I suppose it was, because I can't think of anything. Memory is starting to fail at some point, and why bother grabbing a book when you can come up with a random name? More so, the alethiometer, which is always supposed to tell the truth, blatantly lied to Lyra when it said that Iofur poisoned his father. At that point, I was already too disappointed to even care what happens next, but to my surprise, I found out that the battle was quite good, even if it was nowhere this big in the book. Well, who doesn't enjoy epic battles with witches flying around and bears swiping people like they are plastic toys? But when something is too good to be true, then it probably isn't. Just when you thought they actually start following logic, the movie ends...without an end! I honestly could not believe my eyes and desperately scrolled past the credits to reassure myself that it was not a joke Weitz is playing on us. And here I am, disappointed, asking myself why on earth would you make a movie with so many resources invested and skip the most exciting part of it, the climax?",The Golden Compass
633,smk_buddy,Wonderful movie!! Downplaid by religious groups to cover the truth,8,2 July 2011,"Sad that a movie like this gets boycotted because it has elements of the truth. Many groups boycotted this movie none more than the catholic church in order to not have the rest of the sequel made. Sad for an institute that preaches tolerance to put down free thinking ... Why did ""God"" make our brains? So we can be told what to think? The truth is the catholic church does miss treat children (no amount of dirty checks will change that) and they read Latin so that no one knows the word pope, bishop, cardinal, or the concept of confession to anyone but god, do not exist in the bible. As for the missing bits of the book in the movie it was a bit brief in certain parts that it shouldn't have but time is a factor and with pieces missing in it still leaves room on the shelf for the books. Movies will never replace books in full. They only serve to help us picture everything witch i believe they accomplish wonderfully.What they did lay down barring omissions was pear gold... all you'll find people complaining about is whats missing and doesn't fit into there ideals, and as for that just do your own reading and enjoy a movie as a movie.",The Golden Compass
634,jeyres,Roger Must Die!!!,7,9 December 2007,"I enjoyed this movie to a point. After reading the trilogy and getting thoroughly excited about the upcoming movie, I was quite disappointed with the cutting away and rearranging of so many scenes from the book, like a daemon cut from its child.What I did see I enjoyed. I enjoyed most all of the characters, the scenery, and the animation. I enjoyed Jordan College and the Dining Hall. I enjoyed the Tokay scene, but wanted to see the preserved head. I enjoyed seeing the kids battle, but would have liked more play, like in the dungeons. I thought re-arranging Bolvangar and the bear fight was wrong. Anyhow, you get the picture-- I could go on. In the end, I must just say, ""Roger must die...""",The Golden Compass
635,Milkyway649,Fluffy and Weak Compared to Novel--SPOILERS,1,3 December 2007,"When I first heard that The Golden Compass was going to be made into a movie, I had very low expectations. At first I thought Daniel Craig and Nicole Kidman were very poor choices for the roles of Lord Asriel and Marisa Coulter. However, as the hype started to build about the movie I became more and more convinced of their ability to do justice to those characters.I went to see the sneak preview of the movie on December 1st and was extremely disappointed. How a director can take a novel that is so brilliantly subversive, complex and daring and turn it into such a watered-down piece of drivel is beyond me. Chris Weitz, the director, said that he thought the focus of the novel is Lyra's relationship with Iorek Byrnison, an armored bear. His perspective is apparent in the sense that Iorek's ferocity in the book is transformed into an almost paternal, overly sensitive figure. Weitz leaves out the concept that ""you cannot trick a bear"" as it is presented in the book, therefore leaving the scene where Iorek and Iofur Raknison (Ragnar) fight to be completely meaningless. It does not translate that the bears are equally matched and the only reason Iorek prevails is because Iofur is trying to be a human. Omitting the idea that bears cannot be tricked also muddles the reason why the townspeople of Trollesund are able to steal Iorek's armor in the first place. This makes the bears seem flawed and foolish--not the courageous, aloof figures they are in the books. Finally, the movie claims that Iorek was banished because he was the bear prince and lost in the battle to be king--a huge difference from the book. All of these changes and omissions soften Iorek's ferocity, therefore making him seem more sensitive in his relationship with Lyra. In the books it is extremely apparent that the two love each other, but not necessarily in the tender, emotive way that is presented in the movie.It almost goes without my saying it, but it is very clear that the movie was trying to evade as much wrath as possible from the Catholic church. The religious elements and the corruption of the Magisterium are very downplayed, as well as the actual significance of Dust as original sin from the Magisterium's perspective.The worst part of this movie BY FAR is the ending. The end of the book presents an extremely emotional plot twist with its own cliff-hanger. The movie however stops short of the pivotal scene where Lyra brings Roger to Lord Asriel and instead ends on an optimistic note--that Lyra will be reunited with her father and will help him bridge the gap between worlds. Weitz ignores the emotional complexity of the final interaction between Asriel and Mrs. Coulter and instead offers a dull, blissfully ignorant ending that ultimately is an injustice to the book.There are several other nit-picky things that this movie got wrong that I haven't the space to explain (among them Billy Costa's assumption of Tony Makarios's role in the story, which completely changes the Gyptians involvement in the war, as well as Mrs. Coulter's revelation to Lyra that she and Asriel are Lyra's parents). I will say that all of the actors were well suited for their roles (especially Sam Elliott as Lee Scoresby)--the problem was that the actors had to fill watered down versions of the characters in the books. This movie was so disappointing I am extremely skeptical that there will be any way to redeem it in The Subtle Knife and The Amber Spyglass.",The Golden Compass
636,mkmartin1,It was like reading the book again,9,31 December 2007,"I read The Golden Compass 10 years ago, but the book came alive for me once again after seeing this film. It can be a disappointment to see a movie made from a book you loved, but not this time. The characters were so vividly portrayed, I fished out my copy of the book and the resemblance of the characters to the original cover art was amazing.Anyone obsessing on ""anti-religious"" themes is a poop who can't enjoy a good story. Any religion worrying about this book or movie should wonder why it's feeling so guilty & threatened. The witches were lovely, Sam Elliot a hoot. It's not exactly Tolkein, but Pullman did invent at least 4 ""races"" of beings for this book, ordinary people with their daemons, gyptians, witches,& armored bears. This was thoroughly enjoyable.",The Golden Compass
637,saraopie,Looks good but lacks substance,5,9 December 2007,"The film looked good but I felt that the film had been dumbed down to make it suitable for all. A lot of people leaving the cinema had the same opinion. If the film had been longer then it could've contained more of the book and included more of the theological aspects. I think the books were so good because they expected a depth of understanding from the reader and presented ideas about the soul, etc. in an intelligent way. The reader was expected to think, something the film doesn't! The film seemed really cheesy, rather like the Chronicles of Narnia. I was hoping for something with a bit more depth, like Lord of the Rings. The cast was good and the locations all looked as I'd imagined they would. Young children will probably enjoy this and it may encourage them to read the novels.",The Golden Compass

I don't just mean the plot (but maybe that too) but the intricacies, and nuances of the characters, situations, motivations, etc. I have not read the books, and I actually really DID enjoy the movie. Very entertaining. The scenery, acting, and special effects were fantastic. The characters were too. That said, I do agree with some of the comments made here, that the character development was lacking. And also, there were some really key elements to the story that the viewers who hadn't read the books, were completely confused about. I am certain that 'Dust' could have been explained better, as, I understood that it was extremely important to the whole plot, but yet, really I didn't understand anything at all about Dust. Also the Magisterium could have been much better explained as to their relevance. And the people who's daemons were the wolves, that were always trying to kill the good guys. Surely they could have been explained better. And why exactly was it helpful to separate the kids from the daemons, and what exactly happened to them after they were separated? Did they all end up sick, and delirious in a barn in the Arctic? In my opinion, these very important points were merely just mentioned. If ""I"" didn't get it, then I am certain a lot of people out there didn't either.",The Golden Compass

I think it could of scaled up to lord of the rings if they did better at music and art direction (parhaps a better director could help and not make it too family). acting by some stars in here were superb + storyline is fantastic. The action sequences could use some polishing. I think there is hope for the second film. The DVD is selling great and the film has a great potential to scale to one of the great films. put on a better director and hire good music people and it will be amazing... oh and just to let everyone know, this is AMAZING FILM!.

Much of what drives Lyra through her journey is missing. Many of the important scenes/dialogs from the book have been eliminated leaving the viewer of the movie wondering at the motivations of the characters, or the flow of the storyline.Given all the alterations from the book, I am uncertain as to just how they will transition from the theatrical release of TGC into the Subtle Knife and the Amber Spyglass - with John Parry's head missing, the fact the witches aren't on brooms, makes the witches prophecy and support of Lyra all ... all ... I don't know, missing something integral ...It was fun to watch, I was entertained, but as for a reader/viewer expecting substance, I left famished.",The Golden Compass
642,indigoe2011,Golden Compass,8,16 November 2012,"I honestly champion Nicole Kidman's acting in the film adaption. Sinister and sexy, she makes Mrs. Coulter multi-layered - the rescue and comfort scene in Bolvangsr being incredibly well written. Affectionately sweet but incredibly manipulative. However, I was throughly disappointed with the rest of the characters apart from Lyra. She and Mrs Coulter got the most screen time. Daniel Craig clearly deserved more, being Lord Asriel and Lyra's dad. Mrs. Coulter's two faced personality I did find intriguing, and the scenes in Mrs. Coulter's quarters are highly memorable for me. I LOVED it! best film of 2007",The Golden Compass

Only exemplary movies deserve the very highest rating, and for me, this movie deserves accolades. I looked at some reviews prior to seeing the movie this afternoon,and saw that it wasn't highly rated. Despite this fact, I approached the viewing with an open mind.I have loved the trilogy, and was concerned about just how true to the book the movie would be. I see it as being absolutely authentic to the original. It seems to me that the director has a choice of either digesting everything for the viewer, so that everything is clear, or at least the interpretation is clear, or they can present the scenes, let them unfold, and let the imagination of the viewer complete the experience. The director and writers wisely chose the latter, so that we could arrive at our own conclusions, thus showing a great respect for the audience. This allowed this grandfather to have an enjoyment equal to the enjoyment of the 10 year old girl who accompanied me.The rest of the family had a great appreciation for this movie, as did the surrounding audience.

644,tim-826,Tarnished Golden Compass,4,24 December 2007,"Having waited for what seemed an eternity for the move from the written word to the cinema, The Golden Compass appeared complete with the usual hype that accompanies any film these days - especially fantasy films - and all I can say is what a disappointment. Like many people have already said, I can't complain about the actors or the special effects... it's simply that the magic of the novel has failed to materialise in every other way on the big screen. And I put that fairly and squarely down to the writers and director failing to move past the: ""Oh look, you must be a witch - tell me about yourself... Oh look, you must be an ice bear - tell me about yourself... Oh look, what does the Golden Compass do?"" kind of storytelling. I guess I'm saying that what should have been a magically unfolding, cleverly interwoven modern classic just ended up being almost a series of monologues told to the audience. I think there were enough redeeming features in the film to not make it a truly bad experience, but there were certainly few enough stand out moments to limit it to a 4 out of 10 rating. There's every chance The Subtle Knife might set the trilogy back on track. Let's hope so.",The Golden Compass
645,sudosung,"Great Concepts, Poor screenplay",6,15 January 2008,"On a Positive note, The Golden Compass , for starters has quite a lot of great imaginative concepts. The Visual effects are pretty damn good, and production design is very impressive. I quite like the historic/futuristic world in which the story unfolds. Which brings me to the Negatives. The screenplay is, well, undeveloped. Way too much exposition, and unnecessary dialogue. Acting wasn't to much of a problem, however Lyra, the Protagonists emotion seemed a tad weak as the film played out. But hey, some of that comes down to the director, especially with a child actress and blue screens. Animation of the animal characters is quite life like. The only thing that bugged me was the Battles involving the HUGE polar bears. Which resembled fat men in a mud pit, grappling each other. I mean, they are HUGE BEARS. Attack damn you, attack! Errhh. Personally I would have liked to see them really come down hard with their front paws, smack the snow & ice, with a CRASH! Over all though I think younger children would get quite a lot out of it, one girl in front of us clapping her hands during the more exciting scenes. Ha ha. Original concepts and great Visual design are enough to pass the Golden Compass off for a 6 / 10.

646,fearless531,"A Faithful Adaptation, and a (Mostly) Exciting Journey",8,1 December 2007,"As someone who loves the original books, I felt that the movie was about as faithful an adaptation as can be expected given time constraints. Most of what was left out or abbreviated did not destroy the overall storyline. I also thought that the actors portrayed the characters wonderfully, even those who didn't physically resemble the characters in the book perfectly (Nicole Kidman is a blond Ms. Coulter while in the book she is a brunette, etc.). I was especially pleased with Dakota Blue Richards, who plays Lyra. From the few clips I had seen in previews, I had mediocre to low expectations, but she was in fact a great choice for the part. The scenery/CGI was also quite good (Bolvangar was exactly as I imagined it!).What kept me from giving the movie an even higher rating was that there were parts of the movie that were a little big slow, as another reviewer has commented. I understand that this movie needed to set up a lot of information and thus couldn't be action and excitement throughout, but it was a little choppy in its execution. I felt like the first LoTR movie did a better job of doing a lot of set-up and back story but keeping the overall delivery smooth.Finally, *and here are the spoilers* I was more than a little surprised by the ending. The movie cuts before Lyra visits Lord Asriel and the bridge to another world is created. I imagine it will be used as the beginning of the second film, but more than a few people in the theater were obviously surprised (and perhaps disappointed) when the film ended in a way that may have worked for people who have not read the book, but seemed very abrupt for a person who has read the books and was expecting a few more major events to occur in the movie.",The Golden Compass
647,Haxar,Appalling in so many ways,3,5 December 2007,"I'll start by saying that love the book this film is based on and feel this is a terrible interpretation but even if I'd never read it, I would dislike this film.The film starts badly enough, revealing information on parallel universes and such in a narrator exposition, a typical unimaginative solution to getting across important parts of the plot that they couldn't be bothered including in the film itself. Except in this case, the information isn't important to the story at all and just gets in the way.The pacing is terrible, jumping from scene to scene without giving any of them enough time to develop and really become interesting. Some of the most important scenes in the film feel like they're dealt with in a heartbeat.Most of the characters suffer the same fate, several important characters receive one scene before they are completely forgotten. The opposite is true of Nicole Kidman though I wish it wasn't. She receives far too much screen time, her acting is sub-par and her scenes are often irrelevant. At one point, the film leaves the main characters to switch to Kidman who says ""I know where she is going"" before it immediately switches back to the main characters again. We know she knows this, she revealed it earlier in the film as well but for some reason, that one second of dialogue warranted a scene change. Characters like Lord Asriel, Lyra and Iorek do remain reasonably close to their characters in the book but due to the films terrible pacing, this means they spend seconds making decisions, forming bonds and overall developing as characters where they would normally spend minutes or hours. I realise that a film has time constraints a book doesn't but this feels extremely rushed even for a film.Finally, I am just annoyed with the way the settings in the film had to look so otherworldly and magical. Not only does it ruin the Victorian atmosphere which the book maintained throughout but a few less sweeping shots of zeppelins with jet engines and three wheeled cars with balls of blue fire powering them travelling around London filled with gold and glass domes and white marble towers and a few more scenes spent on characters might have made this film worth watching. But I guess you have to have pretty lights and green flames to bring in the Harry Potter rabble.The only good things about this film are the CGI on the daemons and the bears (who often act better than Kidman), the shots of arctic mountains and plateaus and the acting from Dakota Blue Richards, who isn't perfect but is much better than I feared, and Ian McKellen, who performs very well as usual. None of which is enough to save this film. I was relieved that they cut the ending and hope they do not produce a sequel.",The Golden Compass

It wasn't.An overall lack of character development in addition to an overall lack of a compelling narrative arch are the most detrimental attributes of The Golden Compass. The clumsy and bluntly forced anti-religious message is merely a footnote.The good guys are good. The bad guys are bad (and have no real motivation for being so). Nobody changes or develops throughout the whole film. We learn no fundamental truths about human nature just as we learn no fundamental truths about the pursuit of ""free will,"" which seemed to be the fumbled subtext of the film.CGI effects dominate every frame of the film, and while they look cool, they simply take up screen time that might have been used to offer depth to the characters.Expecting another Lord of the Rings, I was greatly disappointed.

650,jyxmix,Falls short of greatness,6,11 December 2007,"The Pullman trilogy is one of the strongest fantasy series I've ever read with quite deep and intriguing characters. The interplay between the characters and the dialogue revealing the depth of those characters makes his work much more than just a controversial attack on the church. Unfortunately, those same elements are missing or rushed in this movie.Perhaps the biggest flaw was in the casting for the character Lyra. Dakota Richards simply does not convey the sense of optimism, tomboyishness, and leadership that is so evident in the books. To be honest, much of her dialogue on screen feels as though she's just reading from a cue board in the background, without conviction or genuine feeling. Perhaps the actress is feeling those emotions, but the screen does not translate it well.On the positive side, Daniel Craig and Nicole Kidman are excellent as Asriel and Coulter. Kidman especially delivers that feeling of poisoned, but tantalizing fruit well. One remarkable scene in which she reveals her emotions about Lyra stands out; her face visibly changes from one emotion to a completely different one subtly yet undeniably.Overall, the film feels too rushed in its pacing. Unlike the Lord of the Rings films, the Golden Compass film does not take a choice number of scenes from the book and explore them fully. Instead, it takes almost all the scenes from the book, but rushes through them before they can register an impact on the viewer. As a result, we lose the sight of the dynamic character interactions that are expressed with a single look or glance or facial expression not because they are not there, but rather because the camera switches away too quickly.Go for the action, not for the epic.",The Golden Compass

I do feel it's a shame as a great deal was missed out but then I suppose, a screen play cannot really be compared the book it is based on.

Unfortunately this movie does not do the first book one shred of justice. Basically it is plainly obvious that the makers of this movie were trying to get on the fantasy novel movie-adaptation genre CASH MONEY $$$ rush following Harry Potter, LOTR, Narnia etc. They tried way too hard and failed miserably. They have left out all the integral little concepts and links that make these books so fantastic and tried to cram all the action scenes into 100ish minutes. As the movie goes on you can sense they are skipping massive chunks of book to get onto the next 'exciting' scene and it just makes the movie crap. I would recommend steering clear of this one and just reading the trilogy (10/10 for the books).",The Golden Compass
653,Stealthwolf2004,A truly difficult book to adapt...,8,8 December 2007,"There are a lot of perils when it comes to adapting this book. Pullman was quoted years ago as saying that it's even ""unfilmable,"" which, I truly thought it was. I never thought I'd see a little Lyra running across a movie screen because the novel (and all those to follow) are just very difficult to translate into a viable movie.I'm happy to say that I, and Pullman, were wrong...to a certain degree. Let's start with the look.This is probably the most amazing thing about the movie. The look is just a phenomenal part of the movie. The sets are probably some of the most gorgeous things I've seen in quite a long time. Detailed and completely original, they turn antique objects into stunningly new things. And the CGI was beautiful, save a few small little ""Daemons"" that weren't actually very realistic. Technically, this movie is a marvel. I never thought it was possible, but they actually made you feel like this world could exist. Its a viable, tangible world that really could be out there..somewhere. In this respect, it was a major success.The acting was another amazing aspect. While it was well to assume that Daniel Craig as Lord Asriel, Nicole Kidman as Ms. Coulter, and all the supporting characters were going to do a phenomenal job portraying their characters (which they do,) the toughest role was going to be Lyra. This girl is the center of the story, and caries a very difficult film on her shoulders. I'm more than happy to say that Dakota Blue Richards was by far the most phenomenal find for this film. She was Lyra, through and through, and I was grinning from ear to ear to see her be ""Lyra"" right in front of me. One of my favorite characters of all literature, she did her justice in ways I never thought a child actor could, and I commend Dakota for that. In this respect, the movie is a success.Now, for the tough part. The book is not ""The Fellowship of the Ring."" It's not even ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe."" It's amazingly subtle, where some of the most important and riveting scenes do not take place in battles, but between characters, unlike those movies (and books, essentially) I just mentioned. Conversations and revelations about the world Pullman creates truly push it to being by far my favorite fantasy world, far beyond Middle Earth or Narnia. So, how do you make and market a movie where well crafted conversations and characters are the most important thing about the story to kids and the average fantasy movie watcher, who, honestly, is only interested in how many war scenes are involved? You rush through all those scenes where character development and interaction is key, and get to the fight scenes as soon as possible, which, in the book, do not come till the very end.It's a double edged sword, this tactic they use. Sure, you get to the fight scenes earlier, but you lose the characters, which, honestly, is the only reason why the book was so phenomenal in the first place. All those that say the plot is incomprehensible, they were either sleeping or simply not paying attention. The plot is there. You can follow it. The problem is that it moves too fast for what it wants to say and show you. Here's the problem: You rush through those ""boring, talky"" scenes to get to the ""Wham Bam"" action of the movie during its second half. But you lose your characters, and your character's motives, and details about the characters that would bring about all the sense behind the movie. It's obvious Pullman cared very little for the action scenes of his series, and put full attention on characters, which I think is by far the most commendable thing any writer can do. But in a movie where they rush through such things as character and exposition, the characters are just running across the screen, with what seems to be no real motivation for anything. This is why ""The Golden Compass"" works so well in books, but not in movies, because in a book you're not looking for each and every fight scene, and you have the ability to go inside the head of your main character and truly build a connection with them. In movies, this just isn't possible, unless you spend a lot of time focusing on the character and not on the story, which you can't do, since you're trying to market it to kids and fantasy action junkies.So, my final verdict: if they had slowed down, and just completely abandoned the idea of marketing it to ""just"" kids, spending more time developing characters and story, it would have been the best movie I'd seen all year. Sure, the beginning would be slow, but you'd have a connection with Lyra and Pan that would be inseverable by movie's end. But instead, they chose to pander to a younger audience, and an audience of fantasy buffs who aren't pleased unless some fight or battle is taking place. But for what it is, it's entertaining to a certain degree. I'll definitely suggest it to others, but not nearly as much as I'd suggest just reading the book.",The Golden Compass

""The Golden Compass"" is a very good example, as is ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"". Great books - lame films.The book of The Golden Compass does not reveal the purpose of this mystic object ""Golden Compass"" too soon. The movie starts with it as if it had to present the latest iPhone. From that moment on I knew this movie will be a great misunderstanding. So, what's left is a decent action movie with a top notch cast. It does not get the book's message at all. Another great question mark is the concept of a kid's movie. Just because a child has the leading role? So, what the film-makers do is starting multiple new threads without developing them. Who is the strange old man who helps Lyra? Oh, witches? What for, why?

655,dead-eyedfey,A perfect film adaptation of a wonderful book,10,2 December 2007,"The ""His Dark Materials"" series was a huge part of my childhood. I obsessively read and reread those books. And for the past year or so, I have been waiting expectantly for the film adaptation of ""The Golden Compass."" So when my parents surprised me with a ticket to the advanced screening in my town, I pretty much fell down. And this movie was all I wanted from it and then some. It was perhaps the most faithful book-to-movie I have ever seen. Certainly, there were parts omitted and parts changed, but the overall effect was practically perfect. As much as I wanted to see the book's ending on screen, the way that the studio chose to end it (by putting say, the last chapter into the next film) just let it flow much better and made the movie that much more interesting to watch. The only other disappointing part was Iofur's name changed to Ragnar. The cast was nearly perfect, with some awkward acting moments at times. Daniel Craig and Eva Green, despite my love of both of their works, were a little bit over the top at times in my mind. Dakota Blue Richards was absolutely wonderful, much better than the Harry Potter kids were at her age. And anyone who questioned Nicole Kidman as Mrs. Coulter (I personally am not a fan), the way she played Coulter was spot-on. When one looks forward this much to a film, they are bound the be let down, and I was not. I could not have hoped for this to turn out any better than it did. I say bravo.",The Golden Compass

However-it is so deep in fantasy, that it is difficult to see it as anything more.

Just go see it when its on DVD or so.Sorry for the crappy English. I did my best.MichielAfter watching the trailer again , 4 weeks after i saw the movie. I thought i was watching the movie again. Absolutely no information gets left out in that trailer and its directed in the same stupid way the actuall movie is ( no storyline lol, not that i expect that from a trailer. but ye:P )",The Golden Compass
658,Mr-Subtle-Mouth,"Hugely enjoyable and entertaining, Only a slight let down.",10,25 November 2007,"I watched the film expecting the worst and I was surprised. The film opens in cinematic fashion with a voice-over by Eva Green explaining dust and parallel worlds. I think it was digestible for anyone who is a non-familiar. Next we move into our own world, the true Oxford of London. Then in a seamless and beautiful effect, a wave of light shimmers across the screen, and we enter Lyra's Oxford like something out of Doctor Who. It's a visually stunning opening that suggests great things lie ahead. Next we are thrown into a wild children romp like something out of Lord of the Flies, with Lyra, Roger and pals against the Gyptian kids. And here enters the star of this movie - Dakota Blue Richards. From the start to the end she perfectly embodies all the cheek, all the inquisitiveness, all the curiosity, all the fight, all the courage and all the heart of Lyra. I think she is the heart of the movie and the best thing in it. In the Oxford section of the story is some of the best scenes in the movie. No big action sequences just intimate moments between the characters. Lyra and Rogers respect for each other is made abundantly clear. Daniel Craig is on superior form as he presents his findings at Jordan college. And Mrs Coulters entrance and icy exchange with the Master, sent chills down my spine. Kidman delivers the line, ""Let me deal with Asriel"" with such unbelievable venom. Nicole Kidman has been burdened by a few flops recently. I can report the iconic actress is back where she belongs. She is sinister and stunningly beautiful in equal measure. I thought the movie was going down a path of perfection right up until Lyra's escape scene. This is where the story starts moving very quickly. To illustrate my point; Lyra runs away, gets attacked, is saved by the Gyptians, asks the Gyptians to take her North and its all aboard the ship in about the space of 15 minutes. This is all very exciting and full of adrenaline but as a book fan, i don't understand why they are in such a hurry. The movie continues to move along at a quick pace barely giving you time to breath. Its really a good thing and a bad thing. You could say it's a good thing because as a result it holds your interest. However non book readers would be easily lost if they decide on a 2 minute toilet break. I'm a fan of thrillers so I like frantic and quick paced, however in the case of this movie it would have been nice if they had just slowed things down now and again, because like the Oxford scenes proved, intimacy between characters is Weitz strong suit. I also thought there where scenes missing, like it was filmed to be longer, but either by Weitz hand or by New Lines, some scenes where lost. One such scene is Lyra crossing the Ice Bridge. People who have read the book will know that Lyra crosses the bridge in pursuit of Lord Asriel and Roger. In the film this bridge now leads to Bolvanger. But it was evident to me that when they filmed the scene, it was still leading to Lord Asriel and was intended as a farewell scene to Iorek. Overall the scene I loved the most was the Bear Fight. Though I had one complaint. While the animation of Iorek and Ragnar is astounding, unfortunately a few of the surrounding bears who watch the fight appear to have been rushed and not given the same time as Iorek and Ragnar. Though most of the time your attention will be focused on the fight. All the Oxford scenes are pure perfection, the scene of Lyra riding Iorek and finding the severed form of Billy Costa is brief but chillingly effective, the battle at Bolvanger which is suitably brutal and action packed and the final scene. While I still missed the books climax, the movies end is still satisfying. On board Scoresby's balloon we are treated to a heart wrenching scene between Lyra and Roger. Roger exclaims with all his sincerity that he would travel to the ends of the world with Lyra, and Lyra says just let them try and stop us. Book familiars will know why this is heart wrenching, because we all know Rogers fate. The films conclusion worked because the re-union of Lyra and Roger was emotionally satisfying, but I think the books climax would have lifted it to greater strenghts. What I didn't like; it was too short, Kidman and Craig don't really get enough screen time, Mckellens voice, rushed at times, evidently missing scenes and the Magesterium just isn't sinister enough. Its a fantastic fantasy adventure that will be enjoyed by most. Its just aggravating knowing that it could have been even better. I also think it is infinitely better than both Narnia and Potters first cinema outings. How - Well the Daemons are so much more full of life than the talking creatures of Narnia. If you have a good eye you will notice that the Daemons are rarely ever static or simply shot fillers in a scene. They are alive. The original material of the book is much better realised and visualised than Potter. But they are not the most important reasons. For me it is the young lead(s) that makes the difference. The Potter trio were not great and the Narnia kids were agonising. But Dakota Blue Richards Is excellent. She is the heart and soul of it.FINAL VERDICT: A hugely enjoyable, entertaining movie,astounding visual effects, perfect performances and action packed. If it had been 30 minutes longer, book ending kept , more screen time for Kidman and Craig and less meddling from New Line, it would have been a masterpiece!!4/5 8/10",The Golden Compass

660,alberto-ferrermorant,"Boy, this was bad.",3,29 January 2011,"Embarrassingly bad.I haven't read the books, or seen narnia movies, or stardust, I didn't know this was sorta famous or anything. If you are asking, I'm film and media student from Spain, so English literature is not really our thing. Also don't know about how it made in cinemas. For what I'm reading, this seems like a harry potter film, very expected, from famous author, or whatever. Yet I was surprised by the cast and vfx so I sit through the film.I don't usually walk out of films, we've made some shorts, and not very proud of them, even. So I DO KNOW and DO STAND to watch subpar films without panic. But, man... This was unbearable. Before someone give me the ""it was meant for kids"" line, that's BS. I love labyrinth, dark crystal, hook, all Pixar and even like most of harry potter (for what they are worth) and dozens of other movies alike.The guy who made this didn't know anything about framing, story-telling or editing. The only thing that would make this anyhow valuable are the vfx team, yet they didn't save the movie. The cast took their check and bought themselves a Ferrari. An this is not one of those parts that make Nicole Kidman new success era of this decade, but one of those ""hey, I'm free today. Shall we make movie and get paid?""I also don't usually go straight to IMDb to comment, only to check production facts, trivia, cast and such. I usually do after I watch a movie. Buy nobody seem to comment on their liking of the FILM (no the book or story or anything else) I only read comments on controversy I don't know/care. I couldn't stand the girl, I didn't understand what was happening or why the girl talks or travels with an adult she just met - like 4 or 5 times in a row. If it was the other world they were looking for, she had been murdered, raped and the murdered again. The scene with her sitting with the compass in the harbor, when an old man with white air and mustache just come out of nowhere, it's just weird. I thought he was going to offer her candy and then show his penis.This thing really seemed direct-to-DVD stuff, like literal translation to film of a half baked kid tale. I don't know the original material, right now I'm just amazed this movie is so expensive and has that full house cast. Yet it's no wonder why it made so poorly. I would be very angry if I had watched this on cinema. Whoever written this, and whoever directed it, needs to be shot down.",The Golden Compass
661,violence_and_grace,Slaughtered the Ending.,7,2 December 2007,"I saw a ""sneak peek"" screening in L.A. yesterday... I'd heard rumors that Weitz cut the ending for being ""too depressing,"" but I didn't think it would actually happen. IT DID. The ending was so forced, so ridiculous, that the entire audience sat in appalled silence as the credits started to roll. THAT WAS NOT A MOVIE ENDING! Everyone was waiting for the film to continue! With all the fuss about intercision, Weitz made the mistake of cutting the soul away from this film.The really disappointing part about all of this is that the rest of the film was wonderful. Aside from some extraneous scene cutting (ex: exploring with Roger), changes in chronology (Svalbard before Bolvanger, scary bridge on the way to Bolvanger instead of while chasing Asriel), and plot simplification (ex: Tony is replaced by Billy Costa, Serafina joins the action a little earlier, etc.), the film was true to the book. This is why the ending is such an injustice... the part that confuses me most is Weitz had no problem leaving the graphic mauling of a polar bear's jaw in the film. Why take out the ending? See, it's not even a question of being true to the book... the ending, even if it was for an original film, is still extremely poor. It looks like he's holding out for ""The Subtle Knife,"" but I'd say he's counting chickens before they're hatched. If word gets around that the ending is non-existent, it might take a hit at the box office, equaling No Sequel For You, Mr. Weitz.Some Points: -Dakota (Lyra), for being an unknown, does a heck of a lot better than Emma Watson (Hermione Granger) and the rest of the Hogwarts Trio did in the first Potter film. I couldn't take my eyes off her, and she brought life and character to the screen every time she was on it.-I'm on the fence about the beginning: it's nice to be filled in really fast, but it was a lot of information to load on the audience so quickly. Plus, it takes away the mystery and wonder that cloaks the ""parallel worlds"" arc in the book. -On the whole it was okay, but it could have been great. Though younger fantasy fans will eat it up (...but NOT if they've read the book), it's sad to leave a film with a bad taste in your mouth.",The Golden Compass
662,david_harold,Best adaptation of a children's book I've ever seen,10,6 December 2007,"I'm a huge fan of His Dark Materials. Read all the books three times, saw the play two years running.... and I loved this film too. Maybe it helps that I'm familiar enough with the books to ""know"" the characters already but I thought it was very well balanced.The plot is streamlined a bit but true to the book, the anti-religious elements aren't played down as much as I was expecting, the acting is mostly excellent esp. Richards and Kidman and the bears - oh the bears! They're perfect; though Iorek's strategy for winning the big duel wasn't really explained, even if it was sort of shown.I was sorry that the film ends before the book, but I can understand it and look forward to the sequel or sequels (I wouldn't be completely surprised if they condensed the other two books into one longer film if this one is a success). That said I did hear some muttering in the theatre as I think most people were expecting another big showdown to come and suddenly it was over...Still, very highly recommended and I can't wait for the Blu-ray.",The Golden Compass
663,marc_galin,Enjoyable but pace is an issue,7,10 December 2007,"Overall a good movie to see. Is it good enough though to become memorable and draw people back in the movies for seconds ? The first 15 minutes of the movie are very promising as pace, characters, story telling are on the mark. After that, it feels as if someone has pressed the Fast Forward button. There is no time to breathe and if one has not read the books, it could be a bit of a dizzying ride. At the end of the movie, I felt I just watched a 1h53 intro to the next movies where all the subjects would be further developed. As Chris Weitz mentioned in earlier interviews, people on the look out will find subtle allusion to the metaphysical aspects. The acting is quite convincing and that comment extends to Dakota Blue Richards who, simply put, is Lyra. Why only a 7 ? well it fails to connect emotional with the viewer. A movie is first and foremost a great story to tell. Given that this movie is based on, arguably, the best fantasy novel ever written, one is entitled to the highest of expectations. Those are unfortunately not met. I do hope though that movies 2 and 3 will be made. For those disappointed by the movie, I highly recommend the Audiobook version, which is excellent and can be bought off Itunes for under 10$! a full cast of actors, with Philip Pullman narrating a completely faithful version of the book. Now that is pure bliss !",The Golden Compass

665,phil_boylan,I have a contract with this film...,8,6 December 2007,"When I first heard that they were going to make a film out of the most enthralling and inspiring books I have read made my very excited, but at the same time very nervous, as I needed to balance my love for the story with my movie critical mindLike most HDM followers I watched the films production via fan sites and rumour networks quite religiously (or should I say regularly!). We scrutinised every image that was leaked and every rumour that was generated.When the time came to watch the film, I put everything I knew about the books, everything I like to see in films, and all my production worries out of my head, because I know this would only spoil the experience.This film achieved something that I didn't think it would, it made me feel like a kid again, and that is an amazing achievement. Never have I watched the screen with open-mouthed awe at the magic and suspense that I witnessed. The story, despite what other Pullman fans think, was very true to the book it had all the mystery and wonder that I felt when I first read Northern Lights. But here is my first and probably last criticism. Although I was impressed of how much of the book Weitz (or should I say New Line..) had left in after some serious last minute editing, the first half felt quite rushed, characters did not have time to develop enough and that left their interaction with Lyra slightly dry. Despite this, the story had all the elements for what is, and what is going to be, an amazing adventure.Dakota did a fantastic job as Lyra, for someone with such little acting experience, she seemed to fit Lyra so well. The performances all round were fantastic, Kidman played a fantastic Ms. Coulter, there was a constant look of evil and cunning in her eyes that made her so fascinatingly villainous. Daniel Craig was the perfect choice for Lord Asriel and I really cannot wait to see him in the later instalments.On to the CGI and design of the film, and this is the strange thing, its as if Chris Weitz and the productions team reached into my head and plucked out the very images that I conjured whilst reading Northern Lights. The interaction with the CGI was very well done and though some CGI parts weren't too clean the effect was still accomplished. The CGI helped build an amazing parallel world. The Bear fight was astonishing, I recommend paying a little more to get a cinema with good quality sound because you could feel the crash as the Bears wrestled. However New Line now have a mammoth task ahead of them. 1) The ""controversy"" of the Second and Third books is pretty unavoidable without completely revisiting the story, and this makes me very worried as New Line seem pretty open to change on these films 2) New Line also needs to be careful not to rush the second 2 instalments like they did with this one. A lot of relationships develop in the story and cramming it all into 1hour and 50 minutes wont work (I can understand why they made it shorter to keep the children engaged)Overall, a fantastic fantasy film, great performances, great story and good family fun too. Better than Narnia? Erm..Yes!! Better than Lord of the Rings? Ill decide that after the final film.",The Golden Compass

Should have a sequel.The animation was wonderful, and the children actors were all good, including and especially the lead, who could have spoiled it by being far too 'cute.'I have been surprised by the number of reviews that have been less than flattering and believe that it deserves a far more generous take. Is it the fear that it somehow undermines religion? I do not see it that way (though will read the book). The story revolves around the need to allow our spirits to thrive and to not let that be interfered with. Likewise, the animal spirits seem to me to speak to connection.",The Golden Compass
667,davidp128_,"Fans of the book, and regular movie goers, prepare for disappointment",4,10 December 2007,"Upon hearing that THE DARK MATERIALS trilogy was going to be made into a series of films, it really drew hype for myself and i'm sure many other movie goers and fans of the books. I myself have only read the first book, upon which this film is based, and have not read the book in some time, however there is still enough memory of the overall story and characters names in my head for me to have an idea whats coming and know when huge chunks are missed out which in this case there are!Vital mistakes have been made by Chris Weitz, there are huge plot holes in his writing that any movie goer will be able to notice. I give the film 4/10. It has earnt 4 due to the fact the CGI is very good, the fight between the Ice Bears is very epic. The voice acting is considerably good, and because of Nicole Kidman, Sam Elliot and Sir Ian Mckellen for their outstanding performances. The rest of the supporting cast have nowhere near enough screen time that they deserve, Christopher Lee, Dereck Jacobi and Daniel Craig are examples of wasted talent Dakota Blue Richards is not a believable Lyra, and it is hard to believe that she beat other 10,000 other girls for the part, she comes across as very wooden and shows no other emotions at all, she carrys the same vacant expression and irritating voice throughout The Plot is a mess and will seem a mess to people who haven't even read the book. The REAL ending (of which clips can be seen in trailers)is left out of the film and so the ending that the audiences gets will be disappointing as the proper ending (according to book) is very epic and would be marvellous on the big screen.Chris Weitz is definitely not the man for the job as director and if Subtle Knife is ever made (unlikley) it can only be hoped another director takes the helm of directing and script writing in order to try and sort out the mess of a plot Weitz has created.",The Golden Compass
668,peterarcuni,An Engaging Film!!!,9,9 December 2007,"First off, I'll say that I didn't read the book or know anything about the plot, or anything about the religious controversy for that matter before seeing this movie. I meant to go see American Gangster, but was late, so I decided to see The Golden Compass instead. Frankly, I was a little skeptical going in. Was this just another fantasy film based on a book that we can throw in th pile of LOTR and Potter wannabees? Did it have anything new to offer? I was pleasantly surprised in what turned out to be an immensely engaging experience that was visually stunning, heartfelt, philosophical, and well acted. The issues of free will, soul, parallel universes, religion, etc. added a layer of depth that is frankly missing from even some of the great works of fantasy that mainly limit their commentary to society, race and humanity. It's always difficult to gage book adaptations, and from what I gather some people feel that this movie strays too much from the book or does not do its essence due justice. All I can say is that looking at the film objectively without reading the book, I thought it worked. Sometimes films and their source material can be different, but still make sense independently - take Clockwork Orange, Trainspotting or the Original Willy Wonka film for example - they are all different from the books, and on some level leave the viewer with different messages.Is The Golden Compass a masterpiece? Probably not. But the film kept me thinking about the possibilities it offered and got me curious: it made me want to read the book and want to see the sequel. I was a little bummed when I saw some of the bad reviews it was getting, so I thought I'd share my 2 cents, and write my first IMDb review.",The Golden Compass

A necessary change, you can't end a movie the same way you can end a book and unfortunately they had to changed the order of some things.

670,no-signal,The Golden Turd,1,10 December 2007,"I'm giving this film one star to bring the (unreasonably high) score down a peg, seriously I'd give this film about three or four stars. *sigh* I'm a massive fan of the books, so you may assume I'm influenced in that respect, but I'm also a film graduate and approach everything as objectively as I can. For instance, I'm a massive ringer too but took the changes made to LOTR for the films very well and felt they actually improved the story in some areas.THE GOOD: - Nicole Kidman is hot, as always, and acts reasonably well. - Dakota Richards look the part of Lyra. - There was obviously a high budget and the sets are nice. - The scene with Mrs Coulter and Lyra in Bolvangar was very good.THE BAD: - Plot is basically all the most memorable scenes of the book strung together with no exposition inbetween. - Characters just turn up, introduce themselves, give a bit of plot-filler, then bugger off maybe to return later in the film to fill out the shot and look pretty. - The film treats the audience like retards, basically explaining things that should come naturally as the story progresses and also keeps showing flashy visuals for things (reading of the alethiometer) over and over again rather than actually filling the scene with some substance. - Design for the world is ludicrous in some areas. How is there a bridge to Bolvangar that is made of ice and crumbles as son as a little girl walks on it!? Who would make that!? - Acting and dialogue in general is abysmal!! Dakota can't settle on an accent, and everyone else is totally wooden. Except Sam Elliot who is excellent in this film but totally wasted in terms of screen time and impact. - Music is non-existent, I can't remember a single piece of it. Did it even have a theme song!? - Ham-fisted directing and editing means that things aren't given any impact and often will cut away from a scene just as its getting good. Also, characters just seem to 'know' some stuff, without ever having an explanation as to why. - Blatantly aimed at kids, which hurts several aspects of the film. The books are aimed at teens upward, so realistically we were looking at a 12A/15 rated film, alas, it's been neutered.I could really go on all day with the problems I had with this film, it's truly awful and I feel so bad for the production designers and actors who genuinely gave it their all and ended up with this travesty representing their work.

It was really too bad given how good the source material was.As a film is wasn't too bad, though the script was a little weak in places. Scenes a little forced or rushed, at times it talked down to the audience. The actors and actresses did an excellent job with what they had and when the scenes weren't so rushed it was good bordering on great. For a debut movie Dakota Richards did really well.

I can't even agree with those who think Lyra was well portrayed - as one of the papers said, she's been brought up with Oxford scholars all her life and has this weird accent that's all over the place?

The characters where raped of their personalities and the entire storyline demolished.I mean honestly how can i enjoy a movie where a complete stranger will walk up to the main character and say ""I have a secret, I don't know why I'm telling you, you mustn't tell anyone."" They used every opportunity to cram some crap in to advance the storyline and get the endless amount of information in that can only be appreciated by reading the book.The two most annoying changes I found they made though were the order of the end, I mean it didn't really matter which way they chose, why change it for the sake of it? And worse than all that was the fact that Roger lived... I mean if you've read the trilogy I'd like you to think of a way to work that into the book. It is a vital event that drives the whole world of the dead part and eventual conclusion of the book.If you want to see a rushed Hollywood adaptation of a great book where at the end the characters are best friends with other characters they've only had 5 minutes screen time with max, and the characters are bland and stupid then watch this movie.

Other than the ""conflict"" factor was so easily alleviated it was absurd! ex: ""I AM BEAR I HAVE DRINKING PROBLEM AND THEY STEAL ARMOR!"" lara: ""So stop that"" 2 min later...with no significant dialog ""I AM BEAR WITH ARMOR AND I GO ON TRIP LOL!"" Seems shallow, rushed, and just a butchering of the story altogether. its as though they wrote each point on post it notes stuck them all together and said ""HAVE A SCRIPT!""Basically, as is trend: Take the 8 to 10 bucks you plan on using for the ticket, and buy His Dark Materials (theres a collected book now, makes life easier) Just disappointing is all ;__;",The Golden Compass
677,windsorholden-1,A truly awful film (contains spoilers),1,10 December 2007,"I have to say that this was comfortably the worst cinematic adaptation of a novel I have ever had the misfortune to sit through. The fact that the book was so good makes it doubly frustrating. Possibly Chris Weisz was being ironic when he delivered such a soulless adaptation of the book, thereby reflecting the torment experienced by the children deprived of the daemons at Bolvangar - but I doubt it. The emotional peaks of the novel (the deaths of Tony Makarios and of Roger) were simply cut out, the complex motivations of its characters crudely simplified (most notably the Master of Jordan College), while the film moved through events at an unseemly haste. Mr Weisz, the Lord of the Rings film have demonstrated that an audience is willing to sit through films of 150 minutes or more provided the story is well told, and the story needed that for justice to be done. Unfortunately, it also requires a director of greater skill than Weisz. Apparently Weisz backed out of the project at the outset, feeling that he was not up to it. In that judgement, at least, he was right.",The Golden Compass
678,foxylover777,My take on The Golden Compass (spoilers!),7,15 December 2007,"When I heard that there was a golden compass movie I flipped as I always do when I hear there making a movie of a book I read. Then I realize that almost every book to. Live I be seen has been OK to say the least. So about 3 hours ago I sat down in the theater seat and it started. I already read a review so I kinda knew what to expect (too rushed, different ending,...etc) So it starts and wowed by the pretty intro and oxford and the daemons. As the movie went along I started feel where it was rushed. In some book -to-movie movies they merge events together to save time. Well I have had some bad experiences with that trick as in Eragon or Harry Potter 4. But I was pleasantly surprised when they merged two scenes and it actually worked which made me very pleased. So as the movie was hopping along the bear fight came up. Oh My God that was so epic and amazing as I imagined it. Then the fight with the guards vs the good guys which was also amazing as ever. So I was and braced and anticipating the ending which I read a couple years ago. So Lyra makes some victorious speech and it fades to black and the credits roll. I was dumbstruck and not in a good way. I was mad. Why would they drop it off like there's a sequel. Grrr. If they kept the original ending and made it less rushed then I would probably worship this movie but since my prayers weren't answered it got a 7 in my eyes. Overall if you haven't read the book it might be alittle confusing butatleast the ending wont suck as much. If u have read it be you have been warned. -Mykel G.",The Golden Compass
679,mtbajker,"Peter Jackson, please save the trilogy",2,30 December 2007,"I wonder if Chris Weitz even read the whole book? OK, maybe he read it, but understand it? I strongly doubt it. A brilliant book like TGC really deserves a better movie. If you read the trilogy and understand it, please avoid this movie. It will insult your intelligence. Why? That's why. * Great CG, the whole movie is just quick CG show * No respect for audience, movie is clearly made for six years old children, but the book is not written for them * Bad storytelling, everything is explained at the beginning, just short dialogs with few words between long CG shots * No character development * Big changes in storyline without obvious reason * Cataclysmic ending from the book is missing completely * Not a single word what is The Magisterium all about, WHO they represent * Completely shallow, no deepness of the book was brought to the movie * The movie is trying to be a new LOTR. Come on! LOTR was made by genius and Chris Weitz made American Pie (!!!)",The Golden Compass
680,mgodp,"A few Pros, but significantly more Cons.",3,9 December 2007,"I read the first two ""His Dark Materials"" books years ago, and remember enjoying them. Admittedly though, i only had a vague recognition of the plot and characters. As such, i was sitting firmly in the line between someone who had read the book and someone who was entering the cinema a Golden Compass virgin. Anyway, to the review.I'll start with the positive points from the movie. Good acting on show in many parts. Sam Elliot, Daniel Craig (what little we see of him) and Jim Carter did good work with the poor script. Dakota put in a solid performance as Lyra, but i just couldn't stand her attempt at Cockney. It was as though the script writer had tried to write in a cockney fashion. ""Let's go and get 'um then, right?"" It just didn't work for me. The CGI effects were amazing, but that means very little in context. The bad. The main, and major, downfall of this film was the script and the direction. It was almost unwatchably infantile at times. There was no flow to the film. 30 scenes turned up with no other purpose than (attempt) to convey a plot point to ensure that there was a point to filming the next scene. Completely unnecessary scenes were also prevalent, and many scenes either dragged on or just cut off when the director got bored. More over, the format of the film was relentless, monotonous and simplistic. 1. One scene we hear that it is impossible that Lyra could use the compass. Next scene (10 seconds later!) : she uses the compass. 2. Scoresby: ""Lyra you need an aeronaught and an armoured bear."" Cut to Lyra getting an armoured bear. 3. Iorek: ""No i'm not scared, but if i was i would master my fear."" 15 odd seconds later: ""We have to master our fear Pan!""It turned into a farcical stream of set-up and conclusion. What they were thinking with the ending i don't know. In a frantic attempt to tie of the myriad loose ends left from the amateurish scripting, the film just ends up confusing you as to WHAT anybody is going to be doing next, let alone why they would want to be doing it. Good acting. Good CGI. Good source material.Let down by the lynch-pins of scripting and direction.",The Golden Compass
681,Eleyvie,Failure. Waiting for another attempt by another director?,3,10 December 2007,"An attempt to squeeze the entire storyline of the book into a 2-hour-long movie has predictably failed. What we got instead is a sequence of a quickly flashing illustrations for the book, displayed with a multi-voiced commentary.I can't help but comment that 150+ million bucks wasted on this movie could be spent in a more intelligent way. Like buying the entire Ghibli studio with both Miyadzaki and making a reasonably long anime series. Then at least major scenario plot lines could be covered, as well as some background, character development and relations. And if you are aiming at a time-limited live-action movie, please do not try to squeeze everything into the plot.Another observation. It seems that during scenario-writing someone in New Line Cinema mixed up the 2nd and 3rd parts of the scenario. At least this is the best explanation I have because there's not one logical reason to do that. The only result is that some characters act stupid and without any reasoning. But since it's the case during the rest of the movie, one can easily oversee this problem.Yet another consequence of the scenario parts incident is the missing ending. Instead of the book ending we see the ending for part 2 of the book, which simply doesn't make sense given all the events that took place by that time.If you want to know how NOT to make a movie on an excellent book, read ""His Dark Materials"" and then watch the ""Golden Compass"". But an even better solution would be to read the book and NOT watch the movie.There are two reasons why I'm giving this movie three stars instead of one. First, the Lyra's London and Oxford just look cool (even if not exactly the way they are supposed to) and second, Iorek's roar is also believable and menacing. Two cool features, two extra stars. And there's really little else to praise.",The Golden Compass
682,sutnage,Not nearly the movie it could have been,4,30 December 2007,"If I had not read the book first, I might have enjoyed the movie more. However, I read Harry Potter first and have yet to be disappointed. This movie was so rushed, and for what reason? There were MANY critical conversations with main players removed from the script. Not to mention, the ENTIRE ending was completely removed from the movie. I realize this means that it will be in the second movie. But I've the second book and there is NO ROOM to add that ending to the beginning of the second movie without completely trashing the second movie. The script writers for The Golden Compass literally ripped out about 70% of the book and re-wrote it with garbage that equated to about 25% of what they left out. The whole point of being excited about seeing a movie based off of a book that you read and love is knowing that if the movie follows the book, it would be awesome to see it portrayed on the big screen. The script writers for The Golden Compass, TOTALLY missed that boat. I was extremely disappointed in the movie. Lyra was given important information during the movie way after she already had it in the book and by the wrong characters. Pivotal scenes in the movie happened in completely the wrong sequence and some with no reason given at all. These scenes are crucial and have to happen in a specific sequence. Otherwise, you miss the valuable meanings and lessons learned that are used in the next sequence. The script writers totally hacked that up.As for the actors, the actors did a fabulous job with the scripts they were given. Unfortunately, what they were given was trash compared to the book. Realistically speaking, The Golden Compass -- the book and The Golden Compass -- the movie are two totally different stories with a small few similarities.",The Golden Compass
683,tesula_harris,Unadulterated Rubbish,2,6 December 2007,"This movie was the biggest disappointment since the first Harry Potter films were released. I could write a thesis on how bad it was.The plot, the characterisation and even the feel of the book had been destroyed. There was little sense of secrecy; Mrs Coulter's maliciousness was overt, and all mystery was replaced with sheer confusion. Without having read the book, half the necessary background information was missing. All Pullman's nuance and meaning were removed and replaced with CGI. Two complete sections of the book were reversed for no apparent reason and without any obvious thought being put into it.And don't get me started on that ending! What was that? I don't know how they expect to characterise Lord Asriel if they miss out his most important act in the book  his murder of Roger is a defining moment for the trilogy; it maps out Asriel's actions in the story to come. It perfectly portrays his agenda, so what is he without it? And the portrayal of the bears was appalling; the raw power of the moment when Iorek eats Ifour's heart in the book is incredible, and it was probably sacrificed for a PG-13 rating  this is the whole spirit of the movie: dumbing down.Also, how will they make the second book into a movie if they corrupt the first so badly? Characters were altered to make them black and white. Lyra was the only truly three-dimensional character portrayed  Mrs Coulter's behaviour seemed merely random. The plot and characterisation was such a shame as there were some fine performances; particularly from Lyra (accent aside). The actors seemed to work well within the limited roles of the movie which is why I have given this movie 2 rather than 1.Oh and by the way  while you were reading this Iorek Byrnison became king. Sorry if you blinked and missed it.",The Golden Compass
684,jflores427,Saw sneak preview last night 12/1,3,2 December 2007,"We were lucky enough to catch a sneak preview last night (12/1) and the house was packed. My daughter and I have read all three books and looked forward to the movie. We came in with concerns as to how some scenes would be done; however, with an open mind. With that said, we were disappointed. If you have read the book, you will continually be saying to yourself, ""That is not the way it happened!"" They changed the timetable, who said important facts, when important facts were learned and even the ending. Lyra hardly ever uses the alethiometer, and the interaction between Lyra and Pan is just not there. While the acting by Dakota Blue Richards is well done, her language from the book is not carried over into her on screen character. I am not certain if this was done for the benefit of American viewers.",The Golden Compass
685,Kinkakuji,Do not be dissuaded by the negativity - this is fantastic stuff,9,9 December 2007,"Well, some of you haters nearly had me fooled. What with some of the negativity bouncing around this film, I was close to believing it myself.But no, I've finally seen the film, and I can happily report that it was not just good, but fantastic. The plot is well explained, and the various strands weave in and out of each other very smoothly, and apart from the occasional hiccup, the pace is pitch perfect. Never does it feel as though it's moving too fast or too slow. The changes made from book to film are initially jarring for those who have read the book, but in retrospect you will appreciate why such changes are made.The acting is competent, with some wooden moments here and there (with the exception of the brilliant Nicole Kidman as the icy Ms Coulter, and the fantastic Iorek Byrnison, who perhaps surpasses even Gollum as a CGI achievement), but is soon looked past as the world of Lyra pulls you in.The ending is frustrating, though, which is disappointing as it will leave a bitter taste in the mouth of movie-goers after doing so well. But it's not as bad as some will have you believe, as there is a climax and a denouement, just not the one some fans will expect.At times you wonder if the film will collapse under the weight of it's own epicness, a huge cast of characters, a demanding storyline and seriously powerful subject matter all wrestle for attention. Weitz, however, does a brilliant job of holding it all together, and extremely well at that. He also handled the controversy of the anti-'authority' issues masterfully, managing to keep fans happy by retaining the hard-nosed message whilst not being too suggestive.Basically, if you loved Lord of the Rings, be assured; this is not another tired re-hash. This is it's own original work, and you will love it too in it's own right. If you fear this could go the same way as Eragon, don't worry -this is a true, red-blooded interpretation with real effort that shows. It's not perfect, and it doesn't quite reach the giddy heights of Peter Jackson's trilogy, but it comes pretty darn close. This is one of the films of the decade, and a must see.",The Golden Compass
686,purkisa,"Watchable, but nothing special.",7,5 December 2007,"I was looking forward to this film with some anticipation, mainly due to His Dark Materials being my favourite series of books. Unfortunately, i feel it has not lived up to the hype surrounding the film, and is certainly nothing special.The positive points of the film have to be the CG and special effects. The daemons looks excellent, Iorek and the bears look really good, and the scenery is very well done. It would be hard to say that you were looking at a green screen for a lot of the film, as the blending with the live actors is done very well. I think the acting is, on the whole, a positive. Kidman plays her role very well, despite the minimal screen time. Craig also shines as Asriel, again with minimal screen time, and the Gyptians all look and act very much to how i expected. The supporting roles are all acted well, people like the college Master, Roger, and the Gyptian leaders. A special mention goes out to Sam Elliott as the aeronaut Lee Scoresby. He fitted the role perfectly, i thought, and was very close to how i imagined the character when reading the book. The film is rather ironically let down by the story. The book is told wonderfully, and is an absolute joy to read, however the film muddles through different scenes with little or feel of journey. I didn't leave the cinema feeling that Lyra had travelled to the Northermost regions of her world, because each scene in the film is almost a separate piece, as if they were not meant to be shown together. The weakest acting i find is from Lyra, played by Dakota Richards. It is not that she plays the role badly, its she doesn't seem to embody the character of Lyra from the book. It must have been a daunting challenge for a young actress, but i don't feel it was handled greatly.All in all it is definitely a watchable film, the effects are excellent and the final (at least for the movie) section is very enjoyable. However, the film could have benefited from being an hour longer. The run time is at best 100 minutes, and even with the final sections of the book cut, it still falls far short of doing the story justice. Another aspect that i feel detracted from the story was the PG rating. A 12 rating would have suited the film much better, and would have allowed the fights to be more realistic, and some of the darker scenes from the book to make it into the film.Final Verdict - 7/10 (however if we see an extended DVD release ala LoTR, I would expect this to jump a point or two!!)",The Golden Compass
687,lunahine,For Fans of the Book Only.,4,1 December 2007,"I absolutely loved this film throughout. Every minor change they made I could understand entirely and each was small enough not to be a bother. In fact, I was cursing myself knowing I'd blow some major bucks going back to see it again and again.That was, however, before the credits inexplicably rolled. They cut off the last chapter or so of the book, which, if you know what happens, is rather important, and what they replaced it with was hardly satisfying. It left the whole theater shocked. No one could believe the film had actually ended. Had they tacked on the final 15 minutes, I couldn't have been more satisfied, but as it is, I feel utterly cheated. If you're not even going to try to get it right, why try at all?",The Golden Compass
688,ideala2,This film made me swear... rather a lot.,6,6 December 2007,"Firstly, I truly adore the His Dark Materials series - and so upon hearing of it's release my stomach decided to tie itself in a knot until I went to watch it.I was nervous, as one would expect, because bringing these books to the cinema was a mammoth task, and I truly, wished to like it.I did... sort of.The CGI was amazing; the dæmons were wonderfully created, as were the bears - I really wanted to pluck Pan from the screen and take him home with me (though that would be taboo). I can definitely see why Ian McKellan was recast for Iorek's voice, as it was near perfect. - I swore in amazement.In my mind, Lyra's oxford was a slightly more gritty, grey than the fields of gold, and almost-too-delicate magnificence portrayed in the film, but wondrous all the same, and it takes nothing from the story, neither to the wonderful bursts of imagination which help create a truly fantastic, and yet believable world.I also feel that Dakota Blue-Richards played Lyra really well, and most of the casting was brilliant. There are certain moments where other child actors falter slightly, and even at one point Nicole Kiddman - but that can all really be forgiven. In reality that the line, and the situation just don't feel right - and the reasons for it are below: I feel they changed parts of the story simply because they could - and I can see no good coming out of it. It seems almost as though some of the scenes are out of sequence or a mere afterthought - and it really doesn't help the story flow.I understand the reasons for it were in order to keep the film short, but that extra half hour had so much potential.*Spoiler - Skip me* Some scenes we miss are: Lyra's fear of the Gyptians (for trying to sink their boat).Tony Makarios is completely left out - instead Billy Costa has (and loses) ratter. This doesn't work because the consequence of being separated from ones dæmon are never shown - you never really feel the true hatred towards the Gobblers. Instead once found, Billy is merely comforted and told ""We'll find Ratter, and everything will be fine, it won't make a difference"" The Roping & therefore John Faa's explanation of Lyra's beginnings, and Ma Costa's true significance.The effects of intercision on the relationship between dæmon - from soul to ""pet"" are never discussed.The idea of the church and Adam & Eve bringing in ""original sin"" is completely side stepped - how will they ever make it work? - I swore in absolute bafflement *End of Spoilers* There is too much significance on Dust, and there's an attempt to make it more ""lord of the rings-y"" with ""one alitheometer left, to rule them all"" (I'm paraphrasing, of course).It doesn't allow us to really get involved in Lyra's own journey.And worst of all... is the end.Nothing happens. They don't even meet Asriel again. It's Ridiculous. YES I know it's marketed as child friendly, and you don't want to end it on a low note - but It really made me swear in anger - I pity everyone around me.I must apologise to anyone who was in the cinema at the time - I can't help but be passionate about it - I'm usually quite reserved.But they shouldn't pull the wool over a child's eyes - the emotion in the books is intense, and thats what makes them so wonderful - painfully so, and they shouldn't shrink from it. Goodness me, will they have trouble with the next 2 films.It's disappointing. I know that this film had masses of potential - and while I understand the realities of Hollywood, I know it could still have been achieved.And yet... I still enjoyed it. I know if i hadn't read the books, while I would be a little confused, I would still enjoy it. So... It seems I'm looking forward to ""The subtle knife"" with that same sense of apprehension - but not so much, because I can see what they can already do - I just hope that the studio grows up, and realises It's audience is much more emotionally capable than it's given credit for.Fingers crossed.",The Golden Compass
689,gbroadfoot,A good children's yarn but not what it should have been,6,6 December 2007,"I went to this film expecting it not to do the books justice but was appalled by how horribly the story had been butchered.All the main actors do a great job with what they are given (Although personally I find Eva green's voice overs irritating). The music and scenery are also excellent. The CGI is good but is overused leading to an artificial feel to the film. This is made worse by the artistic design which seemed to view Lyra's world being much more modern than the Victorian image, which the books portray. The director, Chris Weitz, has clearly overcompensated for having done little CGI before this film.But all of this is nothing compared with how the story is dealt with. At times it tries too hard to be another LOTR film, particularly at the start and ending, but missed the important point that those films followed the books very closely. These books are highly regarded for a reason! But instead the book is rearranged and huge sections discarded leading to a rushed film that makes little sense. As for the religious elements it is obvious that no matter what changes were made people would criticise it for being anti-Christian. It would have been better to leave it how it was and probably attracted a larger audience from controversy rather than rewrite it. This has created a stilted script that has very little of the philosophical themes remaining and it is simply the usual good vs evil affair. I dread to think what they will do with the next books, for example in this film it suggests that the whole war in the last book will be between Lord Asriel's forces and the Magisterium rather than the Authority. It is Ironic that a story partly about religions influence to remove freedoms has caused the film be rewritten. Overall, they have turned what could have been a great epic into a simple Narnia. It is still a reasonable film but is made by people who care more for money than the books. I can only hope that they will still make the next films and that they will be much better. Perhaps Chris Weitz should have played Mrs Coulter, he has certainly shown that he is apt at cutting the soul away from this film.",The Golden Compass
