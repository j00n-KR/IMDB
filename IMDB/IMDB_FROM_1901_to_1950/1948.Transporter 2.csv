0,TheLittleSongbird,Surprisingly entertaining,7,12 April 2011,"I liked the first Transporter, but was not expecting much when I sat down to see this sequel. And I was surprisingly entertained. Yes the plot is rather thin and predictable, some of the CGI is rather obvious and the characters in general could have done with more development and perhaps credibility too. However, the film does look great, with some fast and furious editing and striking locations, and the soundtrack is very energetic. The script is snappy enough without knocking my socks off, the direction is solid and although Transporter 2 is short it is never dull thanks to the lively pace and spectacular action, chases and fights. I'd say the acting has improved this time around, particularly with the female lead, but Jason Statham is just great and exudes a lot of charisma. Overall, a fun and entertaining sequel. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Transporter 2
1,Leofwine_draca,Ignore the stupidity and enjoy the non-stop action,7,22 November 2016,"While THE TRANSPORTER was a fun little action movie, going through the moves and delivering some very stable action sequences, it didn't really provide much out of the ordinary; aside from the oil fight, there was little that the average action fan had seen before. Things change in TRANSPORTER 2, an impossibly slick, overblown and often silly action flick that resembles a James Bond film on acid. Bald-headed Jason Statham is back as the gravel-voiced, smooth-as-heck driver, and delivers his own inimitable brand of martial arts hijinks, just as in the first film. Once more there are a bunch of assorted-race bad guys, who have some dumb idea to take over the world or hold it to ransom; the only person here worth mentioning is Jason Flemyng, who tears up the scenery as a stressed-out Russian gangster.TRANSPORTER 2 seems to contain non-stop action, moreso than any other film I can think of at the moment. There are lots of outrageous chase scenes, such as a speedboat chasing a school bus, and clichéd-but-fun fist-fights in which Statham takes on numerous bad guys one at a time, armed with a hose, amongst other things. This is a noticeably violent film that pushes at its PG-13 all the way through; it's far tougher and bloodier than the first, and is all the better for it. It's just a shame that some of the CGI-laden stunts are so dumb; for instance, I hated the bomb-disposal-by-crane moment, which pushes stupidity to new tepid levels. For the most part, though, TRANSPORTER 2 is slick but somehow old-fashioned, offering the kind of turn-your-brain-off action thrills we've rarely seen since their heyday in the 1980s. A witty script and lotsa violence and stunts make for a winning combination that surpasses the original's formula.",Transporter 2
2,SnoopyStyle,lingerie model killer,6,7 September 2015,"Frank Martin (Jason Statham) returns as the Transporter. He's driving in Florida as a chauffeur for the Billings. They are having marital problems and Frank rejects Audrey Billings (Amber Valletta)'s advances. Frank drives the boy Jack to the doctor's office and stumbles onto an elaborate scheme to infect the anti-drug forces. Gianni Chellini sent the psychotic Lola to kill the doctor. Frank manages to escape but Gianni placed a bomb under his car. Frank is forced to drive off and the boy is kidnapped. Everybody assumes Frank has kidnapped Jack except Audrey and Inspector Tarconi.Who doesn't love a lingerie clad killer? This is completely over the top and an unabashed popcorn action movie. More than ever, Frank is superhuman. The action is fun but it gets a bit mind-numbing after the first half. It's one of those movies where the bad guys' guns vanishes and get a bunch of random hand-held weapons so that they have a fun acrobatic fight. It couldn't really top the lingerie killer model in the doctor's office anyways. It's also hamstrung by a slightly off virus story.",Transporter 2
3,claudio_carvalho,Entertaining Action Movie,7,13 January 2007,"In Miami, the professional driver Frank Martin (Jason Statham) is working temporarily for the Billings family, transporting their son Jack (Hunter Clary) while his driver is on vacation. Mr. Billings (Matthew Modine) is an important member of the government and Mrs. Audrey Billings (Amber Valletta) trusts on Frank, who promises to protect the boy. When Jack is kidnapped by a mercenary hired by the Colombian cartels, Frank faces the criminals and the Miami police force trying to rescue the kid. When the boy returns to his family, Jack discloses the real and lethal intention of the abduction of Jack.""Le Transporteur II"" is a great action movie that certainly will never be indicated to an Oscar or discussed by intellectuals at a table in a bar, but very entertaining and recommended for fans of James Bond, Jackie Chan, Jet Li and movies with car chase and explosions. The story is full of adrenaline, funny most of the time, with very hilarious sequences. The performance of Matthew Modine and his grimaces is the negative point of this film. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Carga Explosiva 2"" (""Explosive Cargo 2"")",Transporter 2
4,jboothmillard,Transporter 2,5,18 November 2008,"The first film was good, and this sequel is just as good, if not better, from director Louis Leterrier (The Incredible Hulk). Basically ex-Special Forces operative Frank Martin (Lock, Stock's Jason Statham), aka the ""Transporter"" who delivers anything with no questions, no names, only the location, oh, and his own rules, has relocated from the French Mediterranean to Miami, Florida. He is doing a favour for a friend driving for the wealthy Billings family, mainly taking 6-year-old son Jack (Hunter Clary) to and from school and anywhere else he needs to go. Frank turns personal when Jack is kidnapped by international crime boss Gianni Chellini (Alessandro Gassman), and held by his associates, including lover Lola (Kate Nauta). With the help of his French police detective friend, Tarconi (François Berléand) for locations and information, Frank is determined to get the son of Audrey (Amber Valletta) and Jefferson (Full Metal Jacket's Matthew Modine) back, oh, and stop the bad guys releasing a deadly virus amongst important government members. Also starring Lock, Stock's Jason Flemyng as Dimitri, Keith David as Stappleton and Jeff Chase as Vasily. There is a more sufficient story, and the action, explosive and chase sequences still make the most impact, oh, and Statham's pretty good too. Worth watching!",Transporter 2
5,ccthemovieman-1,Another Seqeul That Overdid It,5,24 January 2007,"Held Great Promise, But Got Carried Away As with so many action movie sequels of today, filmmakers take what was successful and beat it to death on the second film. Usually it is the violence that is way overplayed and this film is a perfect example. The first movie, ""The Transporter,"" had its share of action, but didn't cross the line and was very entertaining. This sequel gets ridiculous and insulting.The first third of this movie is outstanding; the second third ""fair"" and the final third so ludicrous I kept looking at the clock to see how much time was left in the film. The latter got out of hand with one ""Kill Bill""-type fight scene or car chase after another, each scene being less credible than the one before it. These filmmakers just don't know when enough is enough!Once again, you have likable hero is Jason Startham as ""Frank martin,"" the ex-Special Forces agent who is a now a ""transporter."" You have some wild-looking villains, especially in ""Lola"" (Kate Nauta ) who competes with Tammy Fae Baker n the makeup department (except this woman is hot) and you have an interesting story. There is just no restraint in it. Too bad because this film has a lot of style to it and held great promise in that first half hour",Transporter 2
6,Tweekums,Non stop action let down by obvious CGI,7,9 November 2010,"Jason Statham makes a welcome return as Frank Martin, the driver who will transport anything; no questions asked. In this outing he has left the south of France and is working in Miami, not transporting anything illicit this time, just driving a child to and from school. His parents have no idea of his past nor do the kidnappers who hijack Frank's car and force him to deliver the boy to their boss. Once the child has been taken Frank must do everything he can do get him back; it doesn't help that the police are convinced that he was involved in the kidnapping. In his attempt to save the boy Frank is almost constantly on the move driving fast cars and even a jet ski, when he isn't on the move he is fighting various thugs as well as police officers that try to arrest him.This film is only an hour and a half long but seemed even shorter as it moved at a break-neck speed with spectacular chases and perfectly choreographed fights that reminded me of scenes from early Jackie Chan films. The only real flaw with the action was the use of rather obvious CGI in some scenes that broke the suspension of disbelief. The story may have been a little thin but that didn't matter, as things were happening too quickly to notice. Jason Statham is great in the role of Frank; managing to make the unbelievable believable as he fights large numbers of well armed thugs without appearing to break sweat. François Berléand returned as his friend on the French police force Inspector Tarconi, this time visiting Frank for a few days and providing some nice comic relief.",Transporter 2
7,ma-cortes,Action packed with spectacular race cars and sensational fights,6,2 February 2007,"The former mercenary called Frank Martin(Jason Stahatan) turned in security agent is now serving as chauffeur for powerful marriage(Matthew Modine and Amber Valleta) .He becomes involved in the kidnapping of their son adding an intrigue about biological warfare by ominous nasties(Alessandro Gassman,Kate Naute,Jason Fleming).The picture gets noisy action,suspense,tension and lots of violence when the struggles and killings happen ,being pretty amusing.Chases galore abound with breathtaking velocities and impressive pursuits where the cars leap and fly.It's a run of the mill action film but from the start to the finish the action packed is interminable.Besides incredible fights with bound and leaps by the trainer master Corey Yeun (artificer of cinema Hong Kong spectacular choreography).Overwhelming race cars and pursuits were made by authentic stunts and especial effects.Jason Stathan is top-notch as action hero,he's a tough man fighting stunningly.Alessandro Gasman is magnificent as an extremely clever villainous.Another baddies as Jason Fleming and vicious Kate Naute also are excellent.Lively musical score fitting to the action by Alexander Azaria and glimmer cinematography by Amundsen.The motion picture is lavishly produced by the producer and director French Luc Besson and well directed by Louis Leterrier.In conclusion the film provides fast and furious entertainment and action unstopped with no sense and developed with fast paced and continuous movement.It's a must see for action lovers.",Transporter 2
8,BA_Harrison,Tries too hard to outdo the first film.,5,17 September 2016,"Frank the transporter (Jason Statham) has a cushy job ferrying an irritating rich kid to school and back, but when criminal mastermind Chellini (Alessandro Gassman) decides to abduct the boy, the ex-special forces driver goes to the rescue, uncovering a devious plot to kill a room full of top politicians.I really enjoyed the first Transporter movie: it had just the right level of craziness to the action scenes and Statham played his part to perfection, his grim seriousness counteracting some of the more absurd moments. This sequel, however, verges on Crank territory (gack!), with its attempts to outdo the first film making it absurd in the extreme.As Frank attempts to locate the antidote for a virus that has been injected into the kidnapped kid by the film's loathsome villains, he performs countless superhuman feats that make one wonder whether he is secretly a member of the X-Men. Whether leaping a vehicle from one building to another, flipping a car to detach a bomb from its underside, or surviving a headlong jet plane crash into the sea, Frank is clearly indestructible. It's all several steps too far, sapping the film of any genuine excitement.",Transporter 2
9,poolandrews,A lot like the original.,6,2 May 2010,"Transporter 2 is set in Miami where transporter Frank Martin (Jason Statham) is now living after the incidents of the original film, he has been acting as a chauffeur to Audrey (Amber Valletta) & Jefferson Billings (Matthew Modine) young son Jack (Hunter Clary). While taking Jack to the doctors for some jabs gangsters try to inject Jack with a deadly virus but Frank manages to prevent this, however the gangsters lead by Italian criminal Gianni Chellini (Alessandro Gassman) kidnap Jack for which the authorities blame Frank. On the run from the police Frank is determined to get Jack back but when Jack is returned seemingly unharmed Jack has to convince somebody that he is in great danger as is everyone else from the deadly virus but no-one will believe him & Frank has to go it alone to stop Chellini & prevent thousands of innocent people being killed by the deadly virus...This French American co-production was directed by Louis Leterrier & has the same sort of tone as the original The Transporter (2002) which no bad thing to be fair, while not a huge improvement on the original Transporter 2 is certainly up there & I would say just as good. Unfortunately while Transporter 2 shares all the positives of the original like the cool action scenes, likable character's, a quick pace (Transporter 2 runs a mere 16 seconds less than The Transporter which may or may not have been deliberate) & an enjoyable sense of fun & adventure it also shares many of the original's flaws with a weak script full of holes & moments that are just plain silly like when Frank spots a bomb under his car he drives off a ramp, does a mid air spin during which the hook of a crane snags the bomb & removes it from the underside of his car before it blows up while Frank just lands the car perfectly & zooms off, also if your going to make a deadly virus & release it why make such a small amount of antidote? Surely if the virus is as contagious as is said it would have the potential to wipe out thousands if not millions across the globe including those who were responsible for it? How did Frank get into the plane at the end? Anyway, once again like the original if you can forgive the sloppy writing & plotting Transporter 2 is a lot of fun, there's a bit more plot here with the relationship between Frank, Jack & Audrey while Jefferson as a politician is the center of a complicated assassination attempt using a deadly virus, I suppose Transporter 2 tries for some darker thriller elements amongst the high octane action. Frank is back with his rules & again those are mentioned constantly, the French policeman is back in a pointless cameo role even though it's nice to have him back although the entire film is shifted from France in Europe to Miami in America.Again the action scenes are where Transporter 2 shines but they do stretch credibility at times & are often very silly, there's a bit more variety to them this time & they are on an even bigger scale from exploding buildings to car chases to a silly bit where a car jumps from a car park to an unfinished office building (how did they get back to the ground?) to a cool if silly scene in which Frank chases a bus on a jet-ski, the climax is great as Frank & Chellini fight it out on an out of control plane as it does barrel-rolls & some really great balletic fight scenes which go for energy & spectacle rather than brutality as once again Frank uses whatever he can to beat the bad guy's including a fire hose. The film looks great once again, nice sunny bright locations, some really sexy fast cars, guy's in sharp suits & Lola the female assassin who doesn't dress in much & wields twin laser sighted sub machine-guns. The whole film has a clean, bright, colourful & sharp look about it. I suppose Transporter 2 is pure spectacle, apart from the dazzling action scenes & bright colourful look the plot is a mess & not that much is going on. I did like it though, hell I'm easily pleased I guess.With a supposed budget of about $32,000,000 this was made because of strong DVD sales of the original apparently, filmed in Miami in Florida. The production values are good & you get plenty of action for your money although the CGI computer effects are poor at times & I mean really poor. The original had little CGI while this one has a fair bit like Frank falling out of a window ten storeys high or a car jumping from building to building or the out of control plane at the end & none of it particularly impresses. The acting is alright, again Jason Statham proves to be a likable hero.Transporter 2 basically shares both the positives & negatives of the original & is pretty much more of the same although this one is maybe a little bit too silly at times for it's own good. Great action & a really nice colourful look to the film help disguise the plot holes & lack of a story, overall I enjoyed it for what it was. Followed by Transporter 3 (2008).",Transporter 2
10,dbborroughs,"Sequel to a great action film is in most ways better than the original, yet is some how missing something to make it perfect",9,3 September 2005,"The original Transporter is one one of my favorite films. Its mindless fun with great characters that makes me stop every time I run across it while channel surf. How could they top it? Apparently quite easily.The plot of the movie has Frank relocated back to the US, Miami in particular, where he is filling in for a friend who is the driver for the family of a federal drug official. During his time filling in he has grown close to the young son of the family and promises not to let anyone hurt him. Of course the boy is kidnapped and Frank is not only a suspect, he's also the only one who can save the boy and stop the real plot which involves mass murder.The key thing to understand about this film is that it is completely fantastic and unreal. The stunts, the plot, the whole thing, is completely impossible. If you can accept that fact and just go with it the you'll have a great time. If you want reality in your movies stay home, this movie is completely unreal.The action is spectacular, and the film makers have out done themselves. Its amazing. Everything about the fights and chases is absolutely first rate.The characters are great. Frank is the same great character from the first film. We get to see him actually grow as a person. We feel for him as we see him act as the frantic surrogate father, and our heart breaks as we see somethings go wrong. Taconi, the police inspector is back, and is a joy to behold. I wish that he was better used, but just having him on screen is enough for me.The villains are monstrous people who will do anything to anyone for money or pleasure. They are truly suitable foils for our hero. They are so good, that you never know from the get go how bad things are going to get, or if Frank will actually get out of this alive. Its so nice to have bad guys you can really hate.The plot is much tighter than in the first film, which completely broke down about half way in. Sure, the first movie was fun to the end, but you had to ignore the fact that it really didn't work. Here the movie is a very tight very taut thriller that seems almost alien when compared to the first one, which seemed less serious.The fact that this is a tighter and better plotted thriller makes the fact that there is a major plot jump less easy to accept. There is a moment when Frank finds out whats really going on and he doesn't really tell anyone. He doesn't clue in the police (which he should considering whats really transpiring) he just continues the one man crusade to get the bad guys (for those keeping score its about the time he leaves the bio-lab).Yes, I understand that the movie up to this point has more plot holes than you could drive a fleet of trucks through, but there is a whacked internal logic that allows for some of the holes, but not this. It wobbles the film slightly in that other things become more glaring, like the sense the film is missing part of the soul that made the first film such a great balls to the wall thrill ride.Don't get me wrong I love this movie and as a guilty pleasure its probably going to be on my list of best films of the year, but I should have liked it more... which is an odd thing to say about a film I'm rating 9 out of 10.Great action. Great Characters. A plot with more holes in it than all the swiss cheese ever made. If you love action see this movie.",Transporter 2
11,lastliberal,More action; less character,7,21 January 2006,"I felt so good after starting my organization project that i decided that I would make this a guilty pleasure weekend and just watch films that have no socially redeeming value other than to entertain me.Of course, I started with Transporter 2. I loved Jason Statam in the original and he is pretty much the same in this one. I really though they made a mistake in not picking him to be the next Bond. The trouble is that he had Qi Shu in The Transporter to play off of, and here he has to make do with Amber Valetta and newcomer Kate Nauta, neither of which provide the same appeal. So the time is filled with action, and there is a tremendous amount. More fights and car chases and excitement than the original in that respect. Still, I do miss Qi and wished Jason had someone to round him out in this film. Well, she's on to Wesley Snipes and Ken Watanabe in Chasing the Dragon, and we'll just have to catch Jason next in Revolver.",Transporter 2
12,zardoz-13,"""The Transporter 2"" Never Breaks Its Stride",9,19 June 2007,"Sequels rarely live up to their predecessors, but French director Louis Leterrier's new big noisy dumb action-thriller ""The Transporter 2,"" with lean mean Jason Statham behind the wheel again, proves the exception to the rule. Mind you, the plot of the original ""Transporter"" about the contemporary international slave trade merely provided the framework for a number of audacious auto stunts and hyperkinetic martial arts combat face-offs that obscured its politically correct plot. Famed Hong Kong martial arts guru Cory Yuen did double-duty on the first ""Transporter"" (2002) as director and action choreographer. No, you don't have to worry about walking blindly into ""Transporter 2."" However, if you fork over the bucks for the new DVD 'Special Delivery' version of the original ""Transporter,"" you'll find a free ticket inside, so you can kill two birds with one stone. The first ""Transporter"" ranked as a roller-coaster of a crime thriller. This time around Yuen serves strictly as action choreographer, while art director Louis Leterrier takes over the helm on a follow-up film that surpasses its predecessor by virtue of a bigger budget for larger, more outlandish stunts and more inventive martial arts aerobatics. An equally politically correct plot about an attempt to exterminate the world's head drug enforcement honchos at an international narcotics summit provides the scaffold for these stunts. No, ""Transporter 2"" isn't a foil the assassination yarn. Initially, this Twentieth Century Fox film resembles director Tony Scott's slam-bang, high-octane actioneer ""Man on Fire"" (2004) with Denzel Washington as a bullet-proof bodyguard determined to rescue kidnap victim Dakota Fanning. Happily, Leterrier and his scenarists, producer Luc (""Le Femme Nikita"") Besson and writer Robert Mark Kamen, ditch the child-in-jeopardy plot early on for bigger game. Nevertheless, they were shrewd enough to know that it's not the game that counts so much but how you play it. The kind of audience that will relish ""Transporter 2"" are those who refuse to let realism dictate the bottom line. They know from the get-go that the hero can't die. Genuine connoisseurs of the genre make allowances for stunts and fights that violate the laws of gravity. In big, dumb, noisy action movies, anything visually possible is plausible no matter how implausible it ultimately is. Director Robert Rodriguez's shoot'em up sagas ""Desperado"" (1995) with Antonio Banderas as well as ""Once Upon A Time in Mexico"" (2003) exemplify prime examples of big, dumb, noisy action thrillers. Some stunts in ""Transporter 2,"" especially the fast-car driving, have their antecedents in older movies. At least, Leterrier and company have taken the stunts a bit further than previous ones. Sadly, ""Transporter 2"" suffers from clearly obvious computer-generated style video game footage that undercuts the dramatic impact of the aerial scenes. Furthermore, the quality of the matte shots that stand in for different backgrounds is pretty awful.Anybody that saw the original ""Transporter"" knows that British protagonist Frank Martin (Jason Statham of ""Snatch"") is more than just a top-notch driver who can get out of the worst traffic jam. Moreover, he can kick, punch, and shoot his way out of the most ominous predicaments. The predicaments that Frank faces in ""Transporter 2"" make the tough times in ""The Transporter"" look like a cake walk. When the action opens, we find Frank newly transplanted from the south of France to sunny Miami, Florida. Rather than acting as the wheel man for crazy bank robbers or human slavers, Frank is chauffeuring a high profile politician's son, Jack Billings (newcomer Hunter Clary), back and forth to elementary school. Actually, Frank is helping out a friend by temping for him. Meanwhile, Jack's parents are U.S. Drug Enforcement Czar Billings (Matthew Modine of ""Full Metal Jacket"") and his neglected wife Audrey (Amber Valetta of ""What Lies Beneath""). You don't have to be a genius to figure out that a kidnapping lies right around the bend, and that's part of the fun of ""Transporter 2."" Like the previous ""Transporter,"" ""Transporter 2"" doesn't stray far from the sure-fire formula that fueled the first movie's word-of-mouth success on DVD. Of course, nobody could survive the close scrapes that Frank survives, but then nobody is as good as Frank. During an early scene, Frank nimbly thwarts a carjacking. However, Frank's sense of style makes the scene memorable. Before he tangles with a thuggish gang of ruffians backed up by a school girl with an automatic pistol, our hero sheds his recently dry cleaned suit jacket, folds it neatly atop his sleek, shiny car, then demolishes the opposition without a second thought. As her compatriots in crime lay writhing in agony on the pavement of the parking garage around her, the school girl pitches her pistol and takes a powder. This amusing little incident nearly makes Frank tardy for his appointment to pick up Hunter. Punctuality guides Frank's way of thinking. During the brief time that they have known each other, Hunter and Frank have managed to bond. Yes, ""Transporter 2"" takes short-cuts when other more realistically-oriented movies might wallow about for twenty minutes showing the bonds as the characters forge them. Frank and Hunter grow close enough that Hunter treats Frank as the father that the youth wishes that his real-life dad were. Audrey notices this bond when she isn't quarreling with her husband, who has let his duties override his home life. Into the storyline steps tough guy Gianni (hunky Italian thesp Alessandro Gassman) who dispatches his henchmen to kidnap Hunter. As one of his ruthless henchmen--perhaps—henchwomen, statuesque model Kate Nauta makes an impressive as well as an intimidating killer babe called Lola. She emerges like a cross-between of a sexy Victoria's Secrets model and a trigger-happy small arms sales lady.Aside from one drawn-out dialogue scene between Billings' lonely wife and Frank, ""Transporter 2"" never breaks its stride. Clocking in at 88 minutes, this adrenalin-laced Twentieth Century Fox release features a sympathetic hero, a fiendish villain, and the kind of action that provides a sense of catharsis for audiences that love big, dumb, noisy action movies.",Transporter 2

16,evanston_dad,Makes Unreality Seem Realistic,5,21 November 2008,"Jason Statham returns as Frank Martin in this weaker-sibling sequel to the 2002 original.This time around, he's filling in as chauffeur for a mucky-muck politician (Matthew Modine) and his wife, carting their little boy around from school to doctor to home and back. The little boy is kidnapped by a swarthy villain with an accent and a penchant for walking around with no clothes on and his right-hand man, or should I say woman, who stalks around in red heels and racy lingerie and looks like a satanic version of Twiggy. They inject the kid with a deadly virus in the hopes that he will infect his father who will then in turn pass it on to a conference hall full of world politicians. The villain's one mistake is in making Jason Statham angry, and he comes after him, using all manner of transportation, like cars, jet skis, school buses and, in the grand finale, a private jet plummeting into the ocean.There's barely any plot, and what plot there is is incredibly preposterous. Many plot strands are left hanging, and the script doesn't even attempt to explain how all of the people infected with this deadly virus are cured of it. It's fun for a while, but even in an outrageous action film, I require SOME semblance of reality.Statham kicks ass, as is expected, and the movie is (no surprise) at its best when it's moving.

19,gradyharp,Know why you elected to watch it and you're OK,5,15 January 2006,"Luc Besson and Louis Leterrier created such a terrific action thriller with THE TRANSPORTER in 2002, giving Jason Statham the opportunity to create a man of crime so clever and dignified that the film was an instant success. And so what does that mean in movieland? If a little is good, a lot is better. Wrong! As is often the case with sequels the initial creative bite gets diluted as though success of the original will carry the sequel without much work. In the case of TRANSPORTER 2 the story and supporting cast border on the ridiculous, but if you're watching the film just to see Jason Statham in action, then you'll be satisfied.The appealing aspect of Transporter 1 was the setting - the French Riviera that served as a gorgeous background for all the derring-do of a top-notch cast. Now in Miami, in a role far less interesting than the original plot of Transporter 1, the film strains credibility and that detracts from the thrills. But the good news is that Jason Statham is intact and as fascinating and dexterous as ever. You just have to settle for that (which is a lot) and the movie will satisfy. Let's hope they don't make Statham consider a T 3. Grady Harp",Transporter 2
20,The_Void,"Entertainment,. but nothing more",7,22 December 2005,"The Transporter was a film not quite good enough to be considered alongside the best action films of late; but not quite bad enough to be considered rubbish. The sequel offers more of the same; it's not bad, but it's not great either. It's quite annoying really, as the film is enjoyable; but only in a very forgettable kind of way. The Transporter 2 follows the common action sequel idea of a virus been unleashed. This plot is very unoriginal, but it's made good of by some very silly, albeit entertaining action stunts from car chases to window diving and everything in between. Jason Statham takes the lead role again, and looks great in his suit. Statham is an underrated talent for action films, and the fact that he's English only makes him cooler. He is re-united with his Lock, Stock co-star Jason Flemyng, who provides the film with one of its best moments. The rest of the cast is made up of unknowns, but they all do well enough in their roles. Nobody is particularly brilliant, but the movie doesn't need brilliant performances anyway. Director Louis Leterrier was a busy guy in 2005, as he also directed the very good 'Unleashed'. That seems to have had an effect on this film...I think he was probably too tired to make it really good. Still, it provides a decent hour and twenty minutes of entertainment. Not much else to say really...",Transporter 2
21,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Transporter 2,7,19 October 2005,"Jason Statham is back as Frank Martin, a man who lives by his own rules, a man with a military past who now works as a transporter, a man of few words, a man of action. Little has changed since the end of the first movie, he still drives a cool car, though the BMW has been traded for an Audi A8L W12, and ploughing the streets of Miami, girls still find him irresistible (who can forget Shu Qi appearing at his doorstep and throwing herself at him? Here, Amber Valletta does the same. Lucky dude), and the men can't wait to sock his face.Many were surprised that the Transporter managed to gear up a sequel, but as far as I'm concerned, they can do a movie series with various cool cars waiting in line to be driven by Statham. Mercedes next? But the plot for Transporter 2 had showed some shades of Denzel Washington's Man on Fire, especially in the beginning, only that the kidnap victim is a boy whose relationship with his protector isn't as drawn out or touching as that between Washington and Dakota Fanning. Thrown into what seems like a plot (in an action flick, who cares anyway?) is bioterrorism, as a group of baddies orchestrate an elaborate plan to kill loads with a carefully manufactured virus.Flimsy plot aside, Statham delivers his punches well in action choreographed by Corey Yuen. Probably following the ""Jackie Chan"" style of using almost everything in a particular setting to wrestle with his opponents, Statham proved more menacing without the deliberate comedic acts that Jackie fuses into his brand of action. He might look a bit awkward with the metal pole, but the action sequence with the hosereel was fun, though short.As with Hollywood action flicks, don't expect the hero to be busted up too much, and he's always blessed with incredible luck and faced with enemies who are never marksmen. There are some obvious action flaws that might border on the line of absurdity, but heck, one's not gonna analyze beyond the belief that Lady Luck is smiling on Statham's Frank. The actions were left unscathed by the censors, only a lingering shot of the baddie's girl (the one on the poster) was snipped when the camera reached the upper torso.Have been a fan of Statham ever since his Snatch days, and it's a pretty decent action movie. Sit back, buckle up and enjoy the ride!",Transporter 2
22,siderite,Jackie Chan movie without Jackie,6,19 November 2005,"Replace some of the Jackie Chan humor with driving and you have Transporter 2. Completely unrealistic in grandeur, super cool effects and fights in an implausible setting. So it's a complete no brainer. Nicely done, but nothing but action all around.Jason Statham has some extra muscle and some new suits, Kate Nauta looks awesome, but in a cliché role of a psychotic killer, Alessandro Gassman has a completely secondary role, Matthew Modine also, Amber Valletta is the helpless mother. There is really nothing more to say. Dull fun. I can also say that I've seen Transporter 1 yesterday and, while it is also completely unrealistic, it has more to do with the title and it is better done than the sequel.",Transporter 2
23,KineticSeoul,It's a alright watch,5,28 July 2015,"While the first ""Transporter"" movie was a bit more on the corny side. This one isn't as corny but it's more over the top when it comes to the story and action. When it comes to the direction and story it doesn't make more sense than the first one. The characters actions and decisions just doesn't make any sense at all in this. It's like the bad guys are doing their best to keep the protagonist alive, by trying not to kill him although they are trying to kill him (If that makes sense). And I am not sure if it was intentional or not to add to the wackiness, but the special effects is just downright awful in this. Especially the plane scene. Overall, this is a alright rental.5.8/10",Transporter 2
24,Robert_duder,"Absolute Action Brilliance, if only all action films were this incredible",9,19 January 2006,"I know that the following review will brings hordes of Boo's and hisses and 1 out of 100 found the following comment useful (hopefully at least one) but I was blown away by one of last years most incredible action films I have ever seen. And to top it all off, it's a sequel!! I must admit it's been a very, very long time since I've seen the original Transporter but I remember thinking it was a very good little gem of an action movie that certainly made star Jason Statham a name in Hollywood and rightfully so!! I would now put Statham in the likes of Bruce Willis, Sly Stallone, Mel Gibson and Arnold Schwarzeneggar as an action superstar. It's not a perfect film although I wrestled with nearly giving it an all around perfect score, it was so enjoyable to me. Frank Martin (the main character) is part Jason Bourne, part James Bond, part Jet Li, and just an all around amazing hero. He's bad...a true anti-hero but lives by a personal code, and is so well trained, nobody can touch this guy.Transporter 2 certainly deviates from the original settings of the first installment. The first Transporter took us across Europe which was a popular setting for action franchises of that time (ie: Bourne Identity.) But Transporter 2 brings driver-for-hire Frank Martin to the USA, Miami to be exact where he has taken a job as a driver for a very rich family. Unfortunately for him...or maybe the kidnappers they attempt to kidnap the boy he has been driving and also come to care about very much launching him into a plot to assassinate many US diplomats with a deadly virus spread through the boy. I don't know how much Jason Statham does his own stunts but the guy can move. He has a unique and captivating martial arts style that utilizes a room like a weapon and makes the action sequences drop dead amazing. And if The Transporter series is known for anything it's amazing chase scenes, car, boat, bus, whatever...it's enthralling and this film is without a doubt the definition of non-stop action. The story is also interesting and although not unique, as of late everyone is doing the whole bio-weapon story...it's a great spin on it and when he gets infected it puts a time limit on everything. Transporter 2 brought all the best action movies together and tossed it into one neat (if not a little too neat and short) film that guarantees action lovers will drool!! Now suspension of reality and belief is an absolute necessary part of watching this drop dead amazing action film. There are several scenes that are just absolutely laughable but done so intensely cool that it's easily acceptable for the action lover...we'll accept anything if it's done right. Frank Martin is far too perfect and everything he plans goes exactly the way it should but that's his style and he's one of the best action heroes ever!! His character brings such class to the role, the whole James Bond feel to it and it just sucks you right into it. I think I am beginning a huge of director Louis Leterrier who not only directed the original Transporter but also Danny the Dog (aka: Jet Li's Unleashed) another real gem I enjoyed recently (see my review.) This guy obviously knows action and knows exactly how to lay it out in the midst of a good story. This just isn't mindless action but there is a point and you get drawn in by the characters which makes for true perfection. Amber Valletta does a decent job as the emotional disturbed mother, Audrey Billings. Matthew Modine is also good as the ignorant, powerful father. Young star Hunter Clary who plays Jack Billings, the little boy who is the target of these terrorists really steals the show. He does a great job and has a great connection to Statham's character. François Berléand returns from the original Transporter in a small mostly unneeded role but it was still great to see him back and it was good to see Frank Martin with an ally on the inside helping him do the investigation. Alessandro Gassman as the big bad guy is very convincing and a great adversary as every action film needs but he takes a back seat to the blood chilling performance of his lover and hit-woman Kate Nauta who plays Lola. She's a kick butt bad guy and her scenes against Statham are awesome and she has some great physical fight scenes.This isn't perfection in the vein of like Schindler's List or even the more recent King Kong...I judge each movie by it's own merit for what it is. And for what The Transporter 2 is...it's exceptional. One of the best action films I have seen in a very, very long time. Suspend your reality long enough to just watch a real rough, rugged, raspy voiced hero kick some major ass and you'll love it!! Explosions, incredible fight scenes, a good story, and it leaves you begging for more. If they keep this up and I pray that they do, they could have one of the best movie franchises in history!! With a modest budget compared to other big action films, and the same director this series could shape up to be some amazing things. I just absolutely loved it!! GO FRANK MARTIN!! 9/10",Transporter 2
25,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,You know what to expect...,4,6 May 2007,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning 'The Transporter' (Jason Statham), a.k.a. Frank Martin resurfaces in L.A., where he holds down a respectable job escorting a young girl to school and back. Trouble is, this girl happens to be the daughter of a top U.S. politician Mr Billings (Matthew Modine) and when some criminals, lead by the snidy Gianni (Allessndro Gassman) kidnap her, The Transporter gets implicated in the crime and he must battle to clear his name, whilst also getting in the way of a multi million pound arms deal.We are at the dawning of a new age, the Jason Statham action movie, an age even more anarchic and with as little relevance to plot and logic than the Van Damme/Seagal movies of the late 80s/early 90s. Having not enjoyed the original Transporter movie, I was going to skip this one until I realized this.

But that's not to say it's bad. It's good fun and has some great fight scenes. It's under 1hr 30mins, so its short. But the film offers some good moments. I liked the far fetched car chases and action scenes. It provided a break from the many realistic action films out there. And that's what this film is. Pure action. From beginning to end, it provides thrills. This is one of the better action films i've seen, but by far not the best. But this is a good film to watch when you have a spare hour or two. I would recommend this.",Transporter 2
27,MLDinTN,I call it...fantasy action.,6,29 August 2006,"The only complaint I have with this film is they try to make the story serious yet have the most ridiculous stunts. Frank gets to be the ultimate bad *ss, more so than Bruce Willis in Die Hard. He propels his car in the air to knock of a bomb just in time. He rides a jet ski onto the street to catch a bus. He gets shot at with a machine gun by a hot chick in her undies yet is never hit by a bullet. Amazingly a thin wooden door even stops all the bullets. He jumps like a cat and even jumps in mid-air to miss a collision between 2 cars. But even sillier is when he some how (it's not shown) gets from his car to inside a plane. Frank and the bad guy fight as the plane crashes under water. He simply opens a door underwater- forget about water pressure and gets himself and the bad guy out of a sinking plane. All this while he's supposedly dying from haven been exposed to the virus from the boy. Others are affected but not Frank.

I don't know how they can do these kind of stunts.Frank Martin returns and this time he's laying low as a family driver for a wealthy family. He returns to action when the the family's child gets kidnapped.Jason Statham kicks more butt in this movie. I love all his movies and he did not disappoint me here.

29,CuriosityKilledShawn,Disappointing sequel,5,26 November 2005,"The Transporter franchise suffers from some serious engine failure in this slickly produced sequel and only just makes it over the finishing line. The original had a thin premise and an anorexic plot but delivered brilliantly choreographed fight scenes and down-played gun violence.For number 2 the action is relocated from the French Riviera to Miami, a city often featured in bad sequel movies (2 Fast 2 Furious, Bad Boys II, Police Academy 5). Frank Martin (a skin-headed, forever grimacing Jason Statham) no longer takes dodgy package from A to B, instead he's temping as a chauffeur for a wealthy family. But when the kid is snatched by stereotyped Columbian villain he springs back into action, kicking ass in his own special way.It turns out that the kid has been injected with a deadly virus. And everyone he breathes on will catch it. And so on and so on. An interesting plot device that soon crumbles into a massive pile of plot holes.The action doesn't have the same edge as it did before. I can appreciate far-fetched action films as long as they stay within relative distance of reality. Transporter 2 goes way beyond reality in well into stupidity, turning Frank Martin from delivery man into indestructible super-hero. After a while you'll realize this man can do anything and will always walk out of the worst scenario alive. It totally kills the excitement.And as if the plot wasn't flimsy enough, the narrative just completely shatters and will leave you disorientated and lost among the brawling and battling. Characters come and go with no explanation, sub-plots are abandoned and the film is totally void of a denouement or climax. There's no satisfaction in the silly story being wrapped up.All Transporter 2 really does is showcase a bunch of totally far-fetched fight scenes, while failing at everything else that could have made the film a contender. Even the relentlessly silly Danny the Dog did better than this.Even though it's made by a European director and producer and funded with European money, something that gave the first such a unique feel, this feels an awful lot like a Hollywood trash flick. It's a shame the series had to stumble so soon. Since the end hints a third, one can only hope that Leterrier and Besson get their act together. What began as a series made in the style of Taxi, Ronin and Kiss of the Dragon has ended up tumbling into world where movies like Stealth and SWAT live. And that ain't good.Oh, and I'm tired of hearing about the movie's so-called homo-eroticism. Like I just said, this film is made by Europeans who are not as homophobic as the rest of the world and see nothing wrong with a man visiting another man for a holiday.

Transporter 2 has some of the most compelling and unique martial arts action that appears real enough (as opposed to Fung Fu Hustle) as well as a decent lead character with integrity and ethics, yet all for this, the movies suffers greatly from over the top action, poorly executed with fake looking chase scenes, poorly edited that offer no sense of continuity along with a deflated climax that seemed abit rush hoping that the unusual inside jet plane battle would suffice. There are some unbelievable special effects and situations that just do not appear feasible or realistic and really throw the audience out of the movie. There are some great camera work shots, especially at the beginning, along with a energetic soundtrack. Yet the foundation of the film just feels artificial and loosely put together.

32,The-Sarkologist,I am still wondering why I actually bought this movie.,2,11 November 2013,"The one thing that stands out to me in this movie is that there is a character (one of the baddies) that seems to have a serious allergic reaction to wearing clothes. At first I thought it was weird because it seemed that during a gun fight she would steadily remove items of clothing until such a time that she was only wearing her underwear, however it became clear that unless she was disguising herself as something, she simply walked around in her underwear, with her gun holsters strapped to her. Needless to say I actually found this character to be incredibly annoying and off putting – and it wasn't as if she was even attractive.Anyway, Stratham has come to Miami to help out of friend, and for some reason this French police officer has decided to come over as well (though I didn't actually think they were friends, just a couple of guys that seemed to always run into each other), however he spends his entire holiday stuck in a police station, because at first he is a arrested, and when they discover that he is a police officer (and innocent) they still don't let him go – nice vacation in Miami.As for Stratham, this time he is transporting a kid, but the kids gets kidnapped, but then halfway through the movie they release him, but the movie hasn't ended yet, because the movie is only halfway finished, which means that something else must happen. It does, Stratham drives a Mazarrati around Miami (or some other sports car) chasing a helicopter (and catches up with it), and then fights the bad guy on the plane (after dealing with Miss Underwear), and the crashes the plane into the ocean – and then the movie ends.Why, oh why, did I end up spending money on this trilogy.

Frank Martin is tested on his limits while he is trying to remain calm.Since I had already watched the first movie I knew what to expect from it and it did not let me down because it followed the same pattern with the first movie. The plot was simple but interesting and I liked how Louis Leterrier combined some action scenes with comedy and funny lines. The interpretation of Jason Statham who played as Frank Martin, it was very good and he did a nice job for one more time. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Kate Nauta's who played as Lola, Keith David's who played as Stappleton and Amber Valletta's who played as Audrey Billings.

The sequel had more action sequences combined at a faster pace but it had less character development and plot line. Transporter 2 wasn't that bad, I enjoyed it but the first was better. I don't blame Jason Statham at all. It was not 'raw' like The Transporter 1. Transporter 2 was too commercialized in the fear to win American audience but failed totally. It was pretty fake and the story was too fake and didn't seem that great. I would have preferred it to be Continental like the 1st version. Frank (Stathem) gave his best but due to poor script and story he ended up looking like a 2nd rate actor. The action was good but the Martial Arts was lacking the originality of the 1st version. In my opinion getting involved with a kid was pathetic and sloppy, it didn't seem as great as the original. Also subplots in this film were distracting (the kid having a virus, the relationship between Aubrey and her husband).

36,johnnyboyz,"Sold as an action film, plays out like a superhero film - Frank Martin must've drunk a lot of milk when he was younger.",3,31 March 2008,"Sometimes action films can be good; they can be entertaining but are able to retain a certain amount of class; a certain amount of respectability through their pacing, good characters, realistic situations and stunts that do not step over the line of possibility. Some of these films are films like Die Hard and to a degree, its sequels; then there are the Terminator films and to some peoples tastes, Aliens. Transporter 2 is none of these things; it does not have any redeeming features bar a stone faced and somewhat enjoyable performance from Jason Statham, further emphasising what a good choice he would've been for the role of Agent 47 in ""Hitman"", plus one or two fight scenes you may get a kick out of.But when the action genre goes bad, it capitulates and this is what Transporter 2 does after not very long. The proverbial line I just mentioned is not merely crossed by this film, it is wholeheartedly annihilated thanks to a thousand mile an hour stampede-like charge; guns blazing, cars racing and explosions.........exploding. Transporter 2 is an action film that throws in all the clichés, all the one liners and all the ill-stereotyped issues of representation Hollywood blockbusters threaten to include. This is the sort of film that does not rely on anything else other than action, action, action. The film never allows you to stop to catch a breath, never slows down for dialogue bar when it wants to move the paper thin plot along and just generally insults the viewer.From the very beginning, Transporter 2 makes all the mistakes that you pray you do not have to see. The good guy is an upstanding and easy-to-root-for, white, Caucasian man who dresses smartly and is polite to women and kids  the sort of man who is very dangerous but he has morals: he knows when to be dangerous and when not to, a sort of superhero archetype similar to Superman who could crush everyone on planet Earth if he wanted to but does not. Then we have the bad guy, a slippery and somewhat slimy customer who is of the 'Latino' decent. He is Gianni (Gassman) and is a poor man's Tony Montana with his big house in Florida; his expensive suits; his stick-thin girlfriend and of course, his mountains of cocaine that any 'Latino' in Hollywood has  he's also a bit of a kung-fu expert as crudely shown early on. Then we have Audrey Billings (Valletta), whose son Jack (Clary) is the MacGuffin for the film. She is shown as nervous and careless whilst being systematically placed in a struggling marriage in which she is the victim. Her husband is made to look like Michael Douglas' character out of 'Falling Down'.Sticking with the representation of women, we have Lola, played by model Kate Nauta. Such a clever ploy here; the film thinks it does not even need an actress to fill this role and it doesn't, just a really attractive 'face' that no-one will ask questions of but will get their money's worth out of looks anyway. Lola has two rather distinct characteristics: 1) she never wears anything other than suspenders and underwear unless she needs to disguise herself, and 2) she's a whiz with the dual Uzis on anything but the transporter Frank Martin (Statham) himself. Or maybe that's because he's able to dodge the bullets anyway. So onto the character of Martin himself, and what a load of old rubbish. It is clear that the writers and the minds that came up with this film did not have the bar set particularly high. Martin is able to dodge bullets, he is able to fall from great heights without injury, he is able to manipulate the space around him for his advantage and we are led to believe that he is even able to slow down time. Furthermore, there is always an escape route for Martin; there is always a ramp to boost him up to the next surface or an aid to help him soften his fall (not that he needs it anyway) or a soft landing like a crate covered in a sheet or a load of boxes that just happen to be empty. But logic is not only substituted for thrills on that occasion; there is a terrible scene in the film when Martin's car catapults over a gap and lands on the brink of an edge: ""I think we lost them"" a chopper appears and after a brief burst of bullets, it randomly blows up ""Now we lost them"" is the reply to this phenomenon.There is an equally ridiculous scene when the bad guys actually have Martin in their lair. Instead of putting a bullet in-between his eyes, they tell him to leave with the plan in mind that they will detonate a bomb under his car when he's gone. He leaves and then pulls off an insane stunt to rid the bomb from his car  one of the worst sequences in a film this decade, rivalled only by the final 'rescue' in the Thames at the end of Thunderbirds (2004). Onward, and the film progresses to its natural conclusion of good vs. evil but with the twist that good needs evil to live to save everyone else. Something about a virus that would've wiped out the world; yadda, yadda, yadda but they start with the kid and when that fails they kidnap him instead which DOES work  insane. Jason Flemyng makes a brief appearance alongside Statham and now I'll never be able to watch 'Lock, Stock' in the same manner as I did. You see, Transporter 2 is the sort of film that destroys and ruins even after its ended.",Transporter 2

Alright alright, not that bad...but Transporter 2 is just so much fun that I launch myself from the sofa, find a hose and flail it around like I'm Jason flipping Statham. Can't find a hose? I just use a pole instead. Frank Martin, for reasons unbeknown to us, is now the personal driver of a rich family. A sinister man, who already lives the lavish lifestyle, wants money and infects the family with a virus? But he injected the antivirus into himself? Yeah...me neither. The story is basic, simple, dumb, pointless and simply a means to set up the action set pieces. The acting is monotonous, diabolically dull and has as much heart as a kettle...(literally the first thing I could think of). The visual effects, and there are some, are incredibly noticeable and outdated. The script is functional...that's it. It's far too short and moves along at a rushed pace. Yet...somehow, somewhere...in the bottom of my hollow shadowy heart...I love watching this. Every. Damn. Time! The action set pieces are so exaggerative and absurd, that I literally just go with it.

38,Anonymous_Maxine,Jason Statham  Jet Ski Pilot.Jason Statham  Jet Ski Pilot.,7,22 March 2009,"The first sequel in the Transporter franchise obeys all of the rules of sequels  bigger budget, bigger death count, more gloss, and at least one more lingerie-clad hottie with two hand-held machine guns. It's otherwise exactly the same movie as the original, with a few negligible plot modifications. What isn't changed is the ready-made action movie premise, this time using such an old action cliché that the first thing I thought of was those little sponge-things I used to make my mom buy me when I was a kid. You put a drop of water on it and in a couple minutes it turns into a dinosaur or something. But beyond the just-add-water instant action movie beginning, it at least ultimately proves to be another example of the over-the-top action extravaganza that the series has come to be known for. The movie works because it knows not to take itself seriously, and while this prohibits it from anyone in the audience being in danger of taking anything seriously, it doesn't stop it from being fun. There is a scene in the movie where Frank notices a bomb strapped to the underside of his car, and when I saw the way he managed to dislodge it I laughed out loud, and not necessarily in a bad way. You will laugh too, but there is a distinct feeling that you're laughing with the movie and not at it, and that right there is exactly what makes it fun.Frank Martin has been doing some chauffeuring duties for the wealthy Billings family  Jefferson, who works in drug control for the government, and his estranged wife Audrey - and ends up making an unlikely friendship with their 6-year-old son Jack. But don't worry, the unlikeliness of that friendship very soon looks very normal when compared to the rest of the plot developments. Jack is kidnapped by a stereotypical Colombian villain and his henchmen, which include his statuesque blonde girlfriend (who spends the entire movie wearing nothing but skimpy lingerie and a ton of eyeshadow) and a bunch of meathead henchmen. So get this, the villain, like me, is Colombian, so of course he's hell-bent on flooding the world with cocaine, but wait until you hear his plan! His scheme is to infect Jack with a deadly airborne virus that will in turn infect anyone who comes into contact with him. They don't want a ransom, they hand the kid back with amazingly little resistance. But Jefferson is soon attending a conference with lots of high-level officials involved in the U.S. drug control infrastructure. You see where this is going? I hope so, because while the plot is actually a little more complex than you would expect from a movie like this, it doesn't slow down for very long to give you time to think about anything, which I suppose is just as well. It moves frantically from one action set piece to the next, balancing out the preposterous action sequences with greater emotional involvement than the original movie in the relationship between Jack and Frank.But when it comes down to it, The Transporter 2 is exactly the same thing as the original movie. It has all the same ingredients but in slightly different quantities, so your opinion of the first movie is going to give you a much better idea of how you'll like the second one than any review is going to. Then again, something tells me that a good portion of the Transporter target audience aren't big readers, so maybe I'm wasting my time here anyway? Nah, I'm just kidding. That'll be my bad joke for the day. But regardless of the reading habits of the Transporter fan club, I don't need to explain to you that this is not an intelligent action movie. It's a super-fast action thriller with stunts that would make James Bond nervous and a lot of people shooting each other up, but I would be lying if I said it wasn't entertaining",Transporter 2
39,jzappa,Too Dumb For A Dumb Action Movie,5,18 September 2006,"I've always felt that Luc Besson, while being responsible for some good action movies like The Professional, Unleashed, District B13, and even Wasabi, seems to rush through his work. Every one of the films of his that I've seen, even his best efforts, is fluff when it gets right down to it. He doesn't spend enough time developing a premise and certainly not his characters. Transporter 2 is the last straw. I mean, even for a dumb, strictly superficial actioner.The plot is almost a spoof of itself. It has every cliché an action movie could ever rehash, but it hardly has any reason behind anything. Why are the villains doing what they are doing? Why are the heroes doing what they're doing? What's the point of any given scene? Its drama is almost hilariously treated like just a routine, and it ends as if Besson and Kamen couldn't wait to finish it. I'm dead serious: The-ending-makes-zero-sense. There are such obviously gaping holes in the end. I will not spoil it for you, but even if I did, I would wonder what I just spoiled. I would've simply given a fragmentary explanation. That's the only way to describe the climax and denouement of Transporter 2. Even the title, Transporter 2, is like a monotonous routine. Maybe I'm getting too picky now, but it's like a 12-year-old skateboarder would say it. ""The Transporter 2"" is too urbane, I guess.The one saving grace of this horrible misfire is the soundtrack. It's awesome. Buy it and you'll listen to it over and over and over. Most action fans will want to buy it regardless, because, well, remember all the trailers and teasers and ads for Sin City that played that infectious riff that didn't turn out to be in the movie or on the soundtrack? Well, it's in Transporter 2, and it's on the soundtrack. It's just about the ideal soundtrack for a commercial action film. I wish I could say something else halfway positive about this one, but I feel nothing but disappointment and a sad future in Hollywood if movies in this condition can be released nationwide and an ingenious movie like Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang is given only limited release because of a single gay character.",Transporter 2
40,GOWBTW,More Jackie Chanish than the first one!,9,2 September 2005,"This sequel to The Transporter lives up to its name. Jason Statham is back, and he's more intense than ever. This movie got a lot more action, a lot more skin, and a lot more firepower. This time, Frank(Statham) is driving an Audi. And wouldn't you know it? It's bulletproof. How about that! I say this movie is worth its wait and the plot is well played out as well. And the fight scene is out of sight. Just like the typical Jackie Chan movies with a James Bond touch to go along with it. Only Frank Martin is gruff. The Audi is one tough automobile, too bad the Acura could have been like that in the first one. And unlike the first one, Transporter 2 has a touch of humor it, so it would be like the first. I liked all the characters, including the deadly Lola, the half-dressed killer who didn't realize she would be ""backstabbed"" by her own partner. The fight scene between Lola and Frank was something. She still gives me the creeps. What a pity for her. To me, I called that one, fighting to the death. Frank made it well in this movie not getting caught, and handling the encounters with the law. Real smooth. I've enjoyed every bit of this movie, and it puts the first one to shame. The action factor of the movie was bigger and I liked the part where he handles all the henchmen with poles and hoses. He shoots and scores! HAHA! This was no gimmick, Transporter 2 is a must!

41,elshikh4,An Escapism's Chefs-d'oeuvres !,7,24 January 2009,"If you complain about seeing a car jumps from one building to land down on another without a scratch, then this movie is not for you. I think that the makers of it are originally a loyal fans of action movies who lived annoyed of people who watch action movies to remark scornfully: ""Hey, This is Not Real!"", so they collaborated to make a solid piece of movie that annoys these people perfectly, by being a candid crazy nonsense, where being too far is the point, and how this one achieved that cleverly. So as nonsense, this is so wonderful, don't you even think during it, and surrender to its world where one unarmed man can beat 20 armed men, a car can race an airplane, and when it take place in only 24 hours so this is a B movie dreamland.The best about it, else having a slight meaning about a father who must reconcile with his family--is the dexterity of it. It has insane script (chasing a bad guy in a water-ski.. This is awesome), great enthusiastic music that never stops, cozy colorful cinematography like you're watching an touristic catalogue, or a sunglasses ad, with dazzling green and yellow all the time, where every surface is polished and everything is bright, the direction is flawless, this is a storyboard that had to be taught, (Louis Leterrier) must have a star in Hollywood hall of fame, he deserves it more than a lot of American ones I can tell you that, and with an editing which is as mad as the events; then it's an ideal hot cinematic comics.The Transporter (Jason Statham) is a good mix of too many original elements; he's a man of few words, sullen, and angry like (Clint Eastwood), confident, stylish, and always in big action like (James Bond), fights briskly a whole rabble in the same time using everyday items like (Jackie Chan). What's more attractive than being super without having any superpower, but being in modern action movie?! To go through fire, survive hundreds of bullets, fall with a plane to the ocean's deep, and all what will befall you is 1 centimeter cut in your forehead. Yes, it's ""your"" forehead, so you watch and love being totally invincible yet on the screen!Although (Statham) physically can master it, but he just performs all of that without the intention to leave any slight touch of persona for himself. Therefore, he transformed into android action hero that looks human for just rapid moments. In one word, he doesn't affect you as a viewer, even with witty remarks like (Bruce Willis) who he got his hair by the way!, I began to believe that this is something so related to (Luc Besson)'s actual character; whereas in every movie written by him, his lead is incapable of cracking nice lines, or doesn't have a sense of humor basically, so he had to make him here as nearly a silent man. I bet that made (Besson) so untroubled, to deliver the main goods easily and purely.They didn't bother themselves with answering questions like: Why the SWAT arrested the French police officer?, how the lead managed to have any information about the evil guy who took him to the lap?, how he didn't get the virus himself after being with the infected mother? But that's the very reason why the editing is so expeditious. Moreover, asking questions like that in a movie like this is absolute silliness, because when the mastermind evil man wants to kill the lead, he doesn't shoot one bullet at him, as he could and should!, but he does what a character like him must do, especially in the middle of this kind of movies, he puts him in a car with a ticking bomb (Mr. Ian Fleming Thank you wherever you are!). As being illogical here is very much logical. That's the deal from the start. True that that doesn't include the plot holes, but why to think in the first place?, this is too enjoyable to be spoiled, despite any holes that it wants to hole up your brain for temporary time. So if anyone asked you: ""How he sneaked into the plane at the end?"", just tell them: ""You're a fool!"".Aside from exploiting (Kate Nauta) for showing too much skin, I also hated the moment when the lead loses the bomb from the car's bottom by a jump to a ship's huge hook. It was too far even by the movie's own too far limits. But save this and that, Transporter 2 is a chance to buy the popcorn, take your best part of the couch, and have a lovely night.Why it's only an 80 minutes long?!",Transporter 2

In this action pact trill ride, the exciting action begins and ends with Martin giving a hands on display of both his driving skills, which are magical as well as his martial arts abilities, which are incredible. The gist of the story center's around the Transporter being hired to drive a 6 year old boy (Hunter Clary) to school and back. Things become alarming when the boy is Kidnapped by an International organization led by Gianni Chellini (Alessandro Gassman) who claims he did it for a large ransom. Although he has a hidden motive, the claim is really a cover for another purpose. With the help of his friend Inspector Tarconi (Francois Berleand) Martain must use his Special Forces training not only to defeat the kidnappers, but also to save the boy without harming him. From beginning to end this is one wild ride of both physical action, intrigue and high flying adventure. The cast which includes Kate Nauta, Matthew Modine and Keith David as Stappleton, give a most impressive performance.

43,freemantle_uk,A big drop in quality,4,16 July 2013,"The original Transporter film was a modest success and lead to Jason Statham joining a new generation of action stars. A sequel was commissioned and we ended up getting something a lot louder and dumber.Frank Martin (Statham) has moved to Miami becoming a chauffeur for a wealthy family's young son, Jack Billing (Hunter Clary). The husband, Jefferson (Matthew Modine) and wife Audrey (Amber Valletta), have marital problems, leading to Frank being very protective of the boy. But Jack becomes the target for Gianni (Alessandro Gassman), a mercenary who wants to kidnap the boy, forcing Frank into action.The first Transporter film was basically a simple B-Movie with an MTV style to it: the sequel has become an over blown exploitation film. Whilst it cannot be argued that The Transporter was a grounded, realistic affair, there was still some basis in reality: the sequel is a comely overblown actioner that is more comic, treats physics with contempt and goes into the realms of sci-fi. The only real improvements are some of the fight scenes are a little clearer due to less use of quick cut editing and Statham drops the American accent.Transporter 2 is a much more ridiculous sequel with its action sequences and plotting and it almost feels like the film was made by people who have not even seen the first one: but it was directed by Louis Leterrier who was the artistic director of the first film and Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen stay on as the writers. The action sequences are solid for the most part, being well shot and choreographed affairs. But there is too much CGI in some of the driving sequences and the complex.The change in director is very noticeable: Leterrier uses a brighter colour pallet, having a much more stylized approach and tonally more lighter and comic. Leterrier had a fondness for using flashy pans of the Miami, had much more of a willingness to use CGI and slo-mo and had moments of attempting Matrix style bullet affairs. This is a film that wants to be as ridiculous as possible and there is a much more exploitative nature to the film with the main henchman being a biniki clad woman who looks like she is a stripper. This was Leterrier's directional debut and he went on to make The Incredible Hulk and Never You See Me, but this film was a weak start to his career.Transporter 2 has a fine cast but most of them are wasted. Statham is of course solid as the lead, Frank Martin was the character that made his career, and he shows off his action chops once again: but his character has become much more super human in this sequel. Modine and Keith David were under used, particularly David who had a small role as a US Marshall and the film does not use his screen presence or his distinctive voice. François Berléand from the first film has been reduced to no then comic relief and his appearance in the sequel was just so the two Transporter films were tied together. The only improvement was Gassman as the villain who at least had some menace to him and felt like a villain compared to Matt Schulze in the first film.Whilst The Transporter was never a cinematic masterpiece it did at least seem to treats its audience will a little respect: the sequel is a loud, idiotic and obnoxious follow-up and does not ever belong in the same universe. It is overly comic, overly stylised nonsense that has some good fights to save it. Plus the use of a Jamaican taxi driver was a pretty racist characterchure.",Transporter 2
44,dee.reid,"Fast, faster, fastest - ""Transporter 2""",7,12 September 2005,"The first order of business in ""Transporter 2"" is entertainment. Pure unadulterated, braindead entertainment. The words ""over-the-top"" don't even begin to describe the preposterous action setup. Just for a random example, when our hero Frank Martin (Jason Statham) is confronted by sultry vixen Lola (Kate Nauta), scantily-clad in bra and panties and armed to the tilt with two hand-held automatic weapons, she's able to empty literally hundreds of rounds at him and he doesn't even get hit, even though he's right in front of her. There's another scene where a bomb is attached to the undercarriage of Martin's invincible Audi and he uses a crane to scrape it off - in midair. Or another scene where said Audi is able to make a gigantic leap from one building to another over a busy intersection. Or the other, ah, to heck with it; you get my points, don't you?""Transporter 2"" is the high-charged sequel to the first movie ""The Transporter"" (2002), which had equally high-charged action and mayhem courtesy of a European film crew backed by none other than Luc Besson himself. Fight choreographer Cory Yuen again stages the action but presumed Besson acolyte Louis Leterrier (who directed the utterly fantastic ""Unleashed"" earlier this year) is behind the camera this time.This time around, the action has been shifted to America - Miami, Florida, and Martin is the driver for the Billings family and he has become especially close to their young son Jack (Hunter Clary). The wife, Audrey (Amber Valleta), has grown close to Frank as well and even though the two do exchange glances here and there and she comes this +close+ to bedding him in the heat of the moment, she still remains faithful to her absent husband Mr. Billings (Matthew Modine).Evidently since becoming a politician, Mr. Billings has alienated the wife and son and has become the target of some ruthless criminals, particularly Columbian drug cartels, and they've dispatched a team of high-powered assassins to take him out. They would include near-naked Lola, her raspy lover Gianni Chellini (Alessandro Gassman), and creepy Russian chemist Dimitri (Jason Flemyng). But rather than waste thousands of rounds of ammunition and manpower, they have another devious way of getting at the Billings family. Their plan is to kidnap the son, infect him with a deadly virus and then release him back to his family, so that anyone he comes into contact with is immediately infected, and they'll have the only antidote.The plot to ""Transporter 2"" only exists to serve up plenty of unbelievable action scenes. There's more action, even lesser plot, and even lesser intelligence - all ingredients for a perfect end-of-summer piece of cinematic action fanfare. Essentially, in the end, ""Transporter 2"" plays out more like a high-stakes video game in which the hero must simply move from point ""A"" to point ""B"" in a set amount of time while dispatching a legion of disposable bad guys. It even takes the form of a video game at one point where Martin must escape from an airplane after it crash-lands into the ocean.Again, Statham shows us that more or less, he was born to play this part. He displays a nifty set of moves, and even takes the time to straighten up his jacket and tie after taking down some bad guys. And the script also allows him to do some pretty unbelievable stunts in the action scenes, including hanging onto a bar and kicking the crap out of 10 armed goons and commandeering a jet ski. What's so great about that, you ask? Well, he steals it, along with its owner, uses a boat as a ramp and begins riding the thing down the street. See?Is it a good movie? Yeah, sure. I had a free ticket to see it and I'm not going to let that go to waste. It was even more fun because it's my birthday today so ""Transporter 2"" made a semi-perfect gift to myself. Is it better than ""The Transporter""? I guess so, if you like action where there's no point to it, not that it matters in a movie like this. I would strongly advise, however, that you turn your brain off before you see it, and then enjoy.Just wait for ""3"" in a few years, then we'll see if this franchise will still have any gas left in the tank.7/10",Transporter 2

However, the boy's kidnapping is merely the tip of the iceberg and the kidnapper's are planning on unearthing a far more deadly plan...I found the first Transporter film to be a so-so affair; passably entertaining without being particularly thrilling, exciting or brilliant. For me, the sequel is no better or worse than the first film which naturally produces both good and bad results.I found Transporter 2 to be perhaps a smidgen more entertaining than the first film and it also possibly had a little bit more energy. The story in the first film was a little weak, but it felt a tad more credible than the story in the second film which feels half-baked and unconvincing. I think what sets the 2 films apart the most lay with the action sequences; in the first film things were exaggerated and suspension of disbelief was somewhat stretched, but in Transporter 2 suspension of disbelief in the action scenes wasn't just stretched, but it was snapped repeatedly after continually being stretched. Don't get me wrong I'm all for artistic licence and I can accept that sometimes characters in film can seemingly achieve feats that your average Joe cannot; these qualities can make characters heroic, admirable and charismatic and for a brief moment can take you into their world. However, there has to be a line drawn somewhere otherwise the 'action film you're watching with real people' can step away from reality and move into superhero/fantasy territory.You only have to look at some of what you witness here to realise how often that line gets crossed in this film; the best example is the scene where Frank Martin is driving his car across the top of 2 buildings; it's quite clear that this is impossible as the gap is much wider at the bottom than the width of the car at the top. The way the bomb is disarmed from the car is also a personal highlight for sheer ridiculousness.I like action films and can suspend some disbelief, but to me the events that I witness still need to be grounded in some kind of reality for me to be able to take an action film seriously (unless of course it is a science-fiction/fantasy/superhero action film where realism doesn't apply).The story was pretty meh and the film was a little too ridiculous to take seriously, but fans of the first film should still find this sequel enjoyable.

None of the contrived premise of this 2005 action thriller is original, but the rapid-fire and thoroughly preposterous execution should satisfy fans of the genre. It all focuses on unflappable Frank Martin working temporarily as the chauffeur for the son of a rising US government drug czar. Of course, the kid is the target of a kidnapping by a nasty drug lord and his gang of thugs, including a bloodless supermodel killer who looks like pop singer Pink's bodybuilding sister. The plot kicks into high gear with a by-the-numbers ""deadly virus"" angle which conveniently kills anyone within breathing distance from the infected. Your eyes will be rolling throughout, especially the downed plane toward the end, though what barely saves the film is a sense of humor about Martin's anal-retentive nature and super-human dexterity.I think the film could have benefited from more blatant comedy, but sadly director Louis Leterrier and screenwriters Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen seem to take the ridiculous plot line pretty seriously. Jason Statham returns to the title role in this sequel, and he handles the athleticism and Clint Eastwood-like speech mannerisms to the presumed requirements of the role. Alessandro Gassman is appropriately greasy as drug lord Gianni, while supermodel Amber Valletta actually has some credibility as the mother of the kidnapped boy who unsurprisingly becomes drawn to Frank. On the other hand, Kate Nauta plays the supermodel killer as if reading cue cards. Although I like François Berléand as Frank's cop friend, he feels merely like a convenient plot device, and I was disappointed to see Matthew Modine, apparently in a career downshift, playing the drug czar in such a predictable manner. There is a standard making-of featurette with the DVD, as well as a fitfully amusing blooper reel.

It's clear Louis Leterrier wanted nothing to do with the acting, which is a good thing considering he and Cory Yuen worked on the fight sequences instead of getting caught up in the boring exposition. What was the plot? I don't know, something about chemical agents and what not.......There were two things I legitimately disliked in the movie. Special effects and the fact they actually hired someone to do a music score.

53,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,A worthy sequel of the same quality as the original,6,20 August 2015,"For various sequels to original films, they all usually have the same trend in common. That trend is the law of diminishing returns. There are also groups of very few series that have follow-up films that surpass its first entry. Then there are the later installments that work differently than their predecessor, but just match their parent. With this sometimes it works, while other times depending on how good the first was doesn't help it to begin with. For Jason Statham's Transporter (2002), it was an entertaining fluffy popcorn action film that had its moments of ingenuity but was for the most part fairly predictable and cliché for a lot of its running time when it came to character development and plot. Another weak aspect was the backstory to what the villain's motivations were. Thankfully, even for these flaws they did not outweigh the better parts of the film's execution.Surprisingly even with much of the cast and crew being more of a French production with its release, the film gained a sequel. Continuing to write the sequel is Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen (creators of the first movie). As an entire movie, it feels like a better film but in fact, it feels roughly the same as the first. Jason Statham returns as Frank Martin, the ex-military guy for drive-hire (aka a Transporter). However instead being given a special assignment, Martin's in a bit of slump in his career at the moment. Currently, he's doing daily pickup jobs for a parents' son Jack Billings (Hunter Clary). The parents, Audrey (Amber Valletta) and Jeff Billings (Matthew Modine) are on bad terms and are trying to mend their differences, but it's slow moving. One regular day when picking up Jack, Martin's car is hijacked by a trained killer named Lola (Kate Nauta) who works for a hired mercenary named Gianni Chellini (Alessandro Gassman).Turns out that Chellini is testing a viral solution that if injected becomes highly contagious just by breathing it in and the only cure is with him alone. For writing, the screenplay suffers almost the same flaws from that of The Transporter (2002). For one, the whole viral bacterial disease subplot has been used time and time again. What evil antagonist hasn't tried this method yet? The film's most noticeable flaws however lie in its connections to the first film and various assumptions that are made for the audience. Connection wise, other than François Berléand gladly returning as Inspector Tarconi from the first film, there is no other mention to what happened after the events of the original film. The storyline ended properly but it seemed as if Frank Martin acquired a new girlfriend. If not, there should've been at least a mention for the audience. Assumption wise, the screenplay makes various short cuts so that once a conflict is over, everything is hunky dory. When in fact, other than focusing on the main characters, nothing else is concluded when it comes to several other characters. That's rather important.Again though, these mistakes are happily made up for with everything else. One thing that is better in this particular screenplay than the prior one is that it does not include the typical ""female falls for protagonist"" subplot. Another is the direction headed by Louis Leterrier (Co-Director of the original), which instead of having Martin doing his job, he's forced into doing one he doesn't feel is right. That's much different than breaking your own rules like of the first film. It's also not as contradictory either. For action, the sequences that take place are more elaborately stylized and it works well at being fun to watch. The Transporter (2002) had a great scene involving being slicked up in oil and being hard to catch. There's a small reference to that here but there's also a scene that involves using a fire hose. Can you imagine the strength and speed needed to use it the way Statham would? That takes skill. All actors do nicely in their role as well. Nobody felt out of place or miscast. Even veteran actor Keith David has a small role.The cinematography shot by Mitchell Amundsen was well handled. Although he has more credits for being a second unit and camera operator, Amundsen demonstrates he is capable of being the head director of photography. There are plenty of shots that capture all angles of the setting. Whether it is with scenes that involve movement or stationary work, the camera is steady and allows its audience to clearly see what is being portrayed on screen. Composing the music for this entry was Alexandre Azaria and although it is not as jazzy or slick sounding as Stanley Clarke's rendition, Azaria created a reoccurring main theme for Martin. Plus Azaria also includes a mix of organic orchestra, synths and deep piano keys. Those particular cues are not always memorable but they are different on a listening experience level.Its plot still suffers from clichéd writing but in other areas. Also the connections between this and the original are untouched. Other than that the choreographed action scenes, steady camera-work, music, direction and acting is all acceptable. No better and no worse than the first.",Transporter 2
54,Rob_Taylor,Danger! Silly effects warning!,5,22 December 2005,"Well, I like Jason Statham in movies. He brings the right blend of seriousness and Cockney-charm to anything he plays. I enjoyed the original Transporter more, I think, because it was the original. But TT2 is a pretty good sequel with ample supplies of action, fights, explosions and whatever else you could wish for.But I found some of the more ridiculous action set-pieces and foolish CGI-assisted stunts to be a little more than I could swallow. Looking back, it seems as if the production team struggled really hard not to get carried away with computer effects and silly stunts and then indulged themselves anyway.Don't get me wrong, some movies benefit form silliness. But this one wasn't sure whether it wanted to be a hard-core realism-based movie or a comic-book super-hero one. As a consequence, the mix of interestingly brutal combat and almost Jackie Chan-like stunts were at odds with each other and damaged the movie, in my opinion.It's still good but could have been a lot better if they would have dispensed with a lot of the CGI effects. As it is, Jason Statham carries it entirely, even with the silly effects and it is enjoyable.",Transporter 2
55,Matt_Layden,"""Turn off your brain...all the way off""",7,9 September 2005,"Frank is a transporter, he transports goods, but on this outing, he's a driver for a child to and from school. When the child is kidnapped, it's up to Frank to get him back.The original movie was an above average action flick, it made a star out of Statham, who I seem to enjoy in all his movies. He breaks one of his rules and open the package, which sends him on an action adventure behind the wheel, here he has moved to the States and is a hired driver to take a kid to and from school. He's only been the driver for about a month, when a plan to kidnap the kid is underway.This is a film for people who enjoy car chases, martial arts and the ""it would never happen in real life"". Right from the beginning we get a fight scene where our hero takes on 5 carjackers. He kicks ass then drives off. The first attempted kidnapping of the takes place at a doctor's office, where the bad guys kill the people in the office and take their uniforms. Frank sees something is wrong and kicks more ass. Kid gets kidnapped, frank has to get him back, and then more ass kicking and car driving, that is basically your movie here.The one thing that in my opinion that totally took me out of this movie is the unbelievable things that happen. First of all, apparently bullets cannot go through a wooden door, but are able to blow up helicopters and go through everything else, but of course our hero is behind that wooden door, so no bullets. Second of all is the car driving from the top of one parking lot, and landing into another one, unharmed, boy he has great aim. BUT, just when you think he's aim couldn't get any better, he drives his car off a ramp and flips his car in the air doing barrel rolls, hitting a crane to knock off the bomb on the bottom of his car, just as it explodes. This guy is really good. Of course he also takes on 20 guys who all have swords and axes...and he has his fists and feet. Am I done, of course not, he saves the ""cure"" serum from a truck tire, literally before it get's crushed. He jumps in mid air as two cars crash right underneath him. Remembers that oil scene in the first one, well he uses it for his arm in here.If you enjoy that, or can get passes those things, then this movie is a great action film. There were some gripes with the direction and editing, but in this type of film, you can forgive some of that, but it could be a distraction in the fights scenes. Is this going to win an Oscar for the screenplay, well, when stuff like this happens.Hero gets on plane.Hero: You're flight has been cancelled.Bad guy pulls out gun Bad guy: No, you have been cancelled shoots and misses.With all these negatives in the movie, you may be wondering if anyone could enjoy it, well you can, and I did. It's not as smart as the first one, or as fresh, but it does keep your attention to the action on the screen. Among other things....like a women who only wears lingerie, even out in public.The music was your typical modern rock, with a surprising ""Cells"" The Servant (Sin City Theme Music) which comes out of no where. There were a scene or two that made me laugh, the French detective plays as the comic relief, who has a crappy vacation. The ending, well depending on Box Office, could mean a possible third installment.Can I recommend the film? Well, I've told you what happens in it, and if you are okay with all that ""YEAH-RIGHT"" scenes, then of course, it's a good movie to end the summer blockbusters with.",Transporter 2

I actually thought it would be slightly better than the first movie, which I also liked but the plot is better in here. Having said that, the execution in the film runs out of gas.What makes this film slightly badder than the first are the action scenes. Did I say action scenes? Yes, I did. You thought I might say that the film's action scenes was better than the first. I have to answer ""yes"" on that. But there's a flaw: There are too many action scenes! There is one after another and another throughout the whole film! It really gets tiring during the end when you just want no more action scenes! This is probably my first movie where I said that the action scenes were too much.This film really had potential. I liked the beginning in the movie but not the rest as much as the first movie. The acting in the film by Jason Statham was good but Amber Valletta's acting was better.

58,udar55,Better than the original,7,8 March 2006,"I wasn't the biggest fan of the original TRANSPORTER because it wanted to be outlandish yet taken seriously. Thankfully, the sequel dispenses with all that and goes full on overboard. This is the best comic book spy movie not based on a comic book. I knew its heart was in the right place when Statham leaps out a window to catch two vials of virus antidote, lands on a taxi, jumps in the air to miss being squished by two cars, saves one vial from under the tire of a semi and then goes to his car to retrieve a new suit wrapped in plastic. Classic! My only beef is the cut down fight & chase scenes. When your movie runs 80 minutes, why are you cutting down on the stuff people come to see? The DVD offers extended versions of the action scenes and in every case the longer version is better. I can understand why some blood gushing was cut for the PG-13 rating but editing down vehicular mayhem during a car chase is a sin. If they can make another one like this, I welcome TRANSPORTER 3 with open arms. Oh, and if the talk of looney action scenes hasn't convinced you to see the movie, maybe blonde bombshell Kate Nauta will. That character of Lola is like 100 repressed Luc Besson fantasies rolled into one. Easily the best Bond vixen who hasn't been in a Bond film in the last 20 years.",Transporter 2

Then, I found the story not so exciting and spectacular as it was written here. The special effects were not so great as I expected and everything seemed to be too perfect and all déjà vu.

Too many things are terrifically impossible and dumb, besides several fight scenes and the AUDI A-8 chases are really unbelievable, although Jason Statham's allure is undeniably intense.

64,brchthethird,Funnier and more action-packed than its predecessor,7,9 November 2014,"Now having seen all three of the Transporter films, I feel comfortable in my assessment of the third one as pure crap. While this and the previous entry don't really qualify as great cinema, they can still be enjoyed as entertainment. This sequel offers up a similarly thin premise, but executes it effectively and with little downtime for needless exposition. In fact this one is more streamlined than the first, clocking in at about 6 minutes shorter. The basic plot has Frank racing against time to get the antidote for a virus that infected a US government official and his family (and potentially a whole lot of other people). However, despite the shorter running time, everything that was good about the previous film is better in this one, namely the action sequences. The acting is mostly decent, although one of the villains, a female, didn't do as well as everyone else. Thankfully, she was quite a character and fairly easy on the eyes. Of course, it almost goes without saying that the fight choreography was excellent, done by Cory Yuen, who directed the first one. There was a really balletic quality to the fights that made them fun to watch, and the shooting style was able to adequately capture Jason Statham's abilities. The editing was a bit tighter this time around, but it also had the effect of making the hits seem harder, which I suppose is a good thing. There are only a couple of other things I feel worth mentioning in terms of the overall look and feel of the picture. Even though is from Luc Besson's production house, at times it looked and felt like a Michael Bay film, but not necessarily in a bad way. Part of this is due to the over-saturated color scheme which Bay uses in his film these days. Part of it could also be that it was set in Miami, which is where BAD BOYS and its sequel were set. Other than that, though, the cinematography was better and the humor was more appropriate than one finds in a Michael Bay film. Overall, the plot is just as ludicrous and convoluted as the first, perhaps more so, but the fight choreography and action sequences are a slight step up. Recommended for fans of the first one.",Transporter 2
65,MrGKB,Remarkably stupid but eminently entertaining...,7,1 September 2006,"...""Transporter 2"" delivers the action goods with all the reliability of its laconic hero, the rules-abiding Frank Martin (Jason Statham). Frank's doing a friend a favor chauffeuring the current U.S. drug czar (Matthew Modine)'s kid to school, but when a Colombian cartel baddie (Alessandro Gassman) snatches the kid to advance a plot to poison the bulk of his opposition in one fell swoop, Frank kicks into high gear to save the day, along with the help of a French cop buddy (François Berléand) whose computer skills are only exceeded by his culinary command.At any rate, the plotting and action of this sequel are even more comicbooky than its predecessor, but this is not a franchise that has ever promised anything but action, action, action, and that is exactly what the audience gets. Characters are paper-thin, the dialogue is minimalist and mostly trite, but the bang-bang is top-of-the-line kinetic and satisfying, if thoroughly unbelievable. The eyecandy is pretty damn nice, too, in the form of newcomer Kate Nauta as the baddie's righthand bimbo, Lola, who wields twin Glocks and wears ""do-me"" lingerie to great effect. Amber Valetta acquits herself well as the Milf wife of Modine's character, and the inimitable Jason Flemyng stands out as the comedic relief stooge.I'm not sure why I've granted this all flash and no substance chase film a ""7"" instead of a ""6"" or less. All I can tell you is that, like the first film, it won me over in five minutes or less. Maybe it's the distinct Jackie Chan-ish feel of the thing, or maybe it's just that I think Jason Statham could very successfully play the hardboiled lead from Andrew Vachss' Burke novels; I don't know.

66,CitizenCaine,Transporter 2 Slight improvement Over Original,7,29 November 2008,"Frank Martin returns as the transporter in this sequel to the film of the same name. Jason Statham returns as fit and lethal as ever as Frank Martin, chauffeur to the school-aged son of narcotic's agent Matthew Modine. Amber Valleta is Modine's put upon wife who emotes properly at every turn. The boy is kidnapped by oily villain Alessandro Gassman who employs the hopelessly miscast Kate Nauta as a gun-toting enforcer of the Victoria's Secret variety. A villain as sophisticated and rich as Gassman would surely command a female companion with more class than Nauta in this film. She looks like a hooker with bad make-up in almost every scene. The film is co-written and co-produced once again by Luc Besson who knows how to write an action film and how to make it look. Statham drives, fights, and out-thinks Gassman and others at a blistering pace throughout the film. Unlike the first transporter film, there are no lulls in the action for romance to drag things down thankfully. The plot concerns Gassman utilizing a deadly virus to strike down law enforcement at a conference, but Statham causes things to go awry. The chases, fights, and stunts are even more outlandish than the first film, but the audience knows what to expect this time around. There is no marked shift in tone as in the first film, although the unfolding of the plot becomes more unbelievable by the minute. As in the first film, there is an unending number of continuity errors. Still, it's truly an entertaining film from start to finish with another very funny introductory scene in the parking garage.

68,jon.h.ochiai,Hot Transporter 2,9,3 September 2005,"Hot action. Hot women. Hot cars. Lethal villains. Cool hero. Director Louis Leterrier's ""Transporter 2"" is a hot movie. So hot, that it is very cool. Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen's story asks you to suspend reality and ignore laws of physics, though their story is engaging and takes unexpected amazing turns. ""Transporter 2"" is over-the-top action executed with great style and intensity. Jason Statham as Frank Martin emerges as a true movie star. He has an athletic grace, is built like a rock, is intense, and has this gruff voice and presence. Martial arts choreographer Cory Yuen orchestrated the killer fight sequences for Statham. Statham, who was a former Olympic diver, is a world-class athlete, and looks to be an accomplished martial artist. He looks to performs almost, if not all of his stunts. Statham arises as heir-apparent to Jet Li and Jackie Chan. He may not possess their trained skills, but he has this Bruce Lee-like charisma. ""Transporter 2"" is truly his movie.Statham returns as Frank Martin, former Special Forces commander and experienced anti-terrorist expert, who as a favor to a friend is on chauffeur duty for little Jack (Hunter Clary), son of National Drug Enforcement Director Jeff Billings (a well played jerk by Matthew Modine), and his suffering estranged wife Audrey (smart and beautiful Amber Valletta). Audrey has a strong attraction for the noble Martin; however, Martin is man of honor and follows a code. Powerful drug lord, Gianni (evil and dashing Alessandro Gassman) possesses a mysterious virus and anti-virus as part of some grand scheme. While accompanying Jack on a regular appointment, Martin faces Gianni's lethal lover and assassin Lola (totally scorching Kate Nauta). Awesome action. Lola is wet lingerie clad, with automatic weapons blazing. Pure genius. Somehow Frank is suspected of collusion in Jack's abduction, but all is not what is seems. Frank promised Jack that he would never be hurt. Frank is a man who keeps his promises. Always.Besson and Kamen's screenplay is preposterous-- that also being it's true charm and appeal. Director Leterrier infuses such style and energy into the project. He's got young beautiful people, amazing car stunts, and world-class martial arts choreography from Cory Yuen. He knows how to put together an entertaining flick. So when Martin attempts to dislodge a bomb planted underneath his slick Audi A6, the effect is breathtaking instead of ridiculous-- well at least for the most part. Gasssan as Giannii proves a heartless, deadly, and formidable nemesis to Martin (Statham). Kate Nauta is totally hot as Lola. She is as threatening as she is sexy. She definitely as a presence. Statham as Martin is so commanding as the strong loner. Aside from a genuine magnetism and physical presence, he displays an understated compassion. He also delivers a dry sense of humor. Amazingly it's his vulnerability that salvages the movie's over-the-top implausibility. And ""Transporter 2"" is really about honor. Stathem is it's barer.Leterrier's ""The Transporter 2"" is so very engaging and entertaining. It's a lot of fun. Remember what you are watching, and you'll be fine. Jason Statham is a star. He may be the next big thing in action movies. ""Transporter 2"" is a great action movie.",Transporter 2
69,gregsrants,Might end up on the worst of 2005 list,1,11 September 2005,"Ranking right up their with the audiences yearning for another sequel to the Bad Boys franchise, Jason Statham is back in the very cleverly titled Transporter 2.Now for those of you who can hardly remember the first film, don't worry. Both it and now its sequel are tailored so that you can waste time inside an air conditioned theatre and forget almost everything you've seen just hours after the lights come back to full illumination.This time round script writers Robert Kamen and Luc Beeson decided that it would be easier to just copy the premise of last year's Man on Fire and throw our hero Frank Martin (Statham) into the Denzel Washington role. That means there will be a kidnapping of a small child that was under the protection of our hero and there will also be plenty of mindless violence as he searches for the youngin he feels responsible for losing.Now I happen to like Jason Statham. I liked him in Snatch, The Italian Job and even Cellular. He has a charisma to him. A coolness this side of Steve McQueen. Problem is he keeps picking up scripts that even John Saxon would have turned down.Transporter 2 has nothing going for it outside of Statham's presence. It's filled with enough bad stunts and even worse cartoonish villains that even the most outlandish of James Bond films would be embarrassed to utilize such farce. Take for instance the scene where Frank must flip his car through the air to hit a suspended wire in hopes of tearing from the autos underbelly a very well hidden car bomb. I watched this scene uneasy in my theatre seat and would not have been surprised if Wyle E. Coyote was shown in the background huffing and puffing as his plan was foiled.Things do go boom and Jackie Chan would probably be impressed with the fighting contests in particular one clever scene where Frank utilizes a fire hose to engage the baddies. But amongst the few half decent moments there are countless mindless scenes and plot lines that include a virus antidote being stored inside the bad guy (never seen that before!) and a completely implausible ending that takes place inside a private jet.Transporter 2 may not be the worst movie of the year, but I highly doubt that by the time I get to the end of the calendar for 2005 that this clunker doesn't end up on a few Bottom 10 lists.Recommendation: Stay away at all costs.

He now lives in Florida and works as a private chauffeur/bodyguard for a rich family. One day, during a routine trip to the hospital with the family's kid, Frank becomes tied up in a kidnapping plot and the serious ass kicking begins. Just like the over-top action scenes the plot goes from kidnapping of a young boy to chemical weapons smuggling! What fun!This is pretty much a run-of-the mill ""bigger and badder"" sequel with trumped up production values and stunts, but it remains good action entertainment. Maybe it is because the film makers are Europeans they know more about ""not over doing it"" than American action directors. But in terms of over doing it, this film gets pretty damn close and you seriously have to leave your brain at the door to enjoy this movie. Another thing that may nag fans is the Audi S8. While an undeniably a cool car, would Frank, being such a BMW devotee in the first movie, give up his original car? Once again, leave your brain at the door.The ending also promises a sequel, but seeing how close this film comes to being down right ridiculous, it might be a very bad idea, though the idea of three entries in this very entertaining franchise is a pleasant thought. 7/10Rated PG-13: a lot of action/violence and some sexual content",Transporter 2

The bad chick with the dual machine guns should have run out of ammo at least 2-3 times in the doctor's office sequence. There are several fight scenes with our hero against multiple takers.

The sequel to 2002's 'The Transporter' isn't really much different, in fact I personally found it to be way more entertaining and fun to watch. 'The Transporter 2' like the original follows the smooth-talking and slick-dressed limousine driver Frank Martin (the ultra cool Jason Statham) who is a kung-fu trained transporter for different people. While filling in for a job of his buddies, chauffeuring a little pre-schooler/son of a government hot-shot from and to school, he gets caught up in an elaborate kidnapping scheme to wipe out a bunch of politicians with a deadly liquid virus. The city's only hope to stop the mass-murder of the government officials and save an innocent little boy is Frank Martin, and he's not gonna let them down. Sounds a little unbelievable -- hell yeah! But it never ceases to entertain, and you have to give it a slab of credit for that.I personally thought Jason Statham did a pretty decent job in his role besides some of the overly corny dialogue his character had. Statham seems to have amazing screen presence and he really succeeds in getting you (the audience) to like and root for his hard-boiled, sarcastic, butt-whooping hero with a heart of gold. Besides Statham, the acting is average at best with very low-key performances from Mathew Modine (who I'm sure most of you haven't seen in anything since 'Bye, Bye, Love) and model Amber Velleta. The villains in this one seem to be more evil, and Frank's french police inspector friend provides a few chuckles during the movie. The action in 'Transporter 2' is exhilarating but totally unbelievable. Some of the stunts Statham pulls (especially with his car) you'll be rolling your eyes to, but most likely still enjoy. The writing seems to be a tad more solid in the sequel then it's predecessor and so is the directing from Louis Leterrier.In conclusion, I can't quite recommend 'Transporter 2' for theaters but it's definitely a good rental. It's nothing new or innovative, but that's what I kind of like about it. Most action films now days try to be new and inventive or take themselves too seriously, something 'Transporter 2' never even attempts to do. You get what you pay for, a loud, corny and entertaining wild ride that will be mostly embraced by action fans (a.k.a. - it's a guy movie!) If you like explosions and action but want to check your brain at the door, 'Transporter 2' may just be the flick for you. Grade: C+ (screened at AMC Deer Valley 30, Phoenix, Arizona, 9/02/05)my ratings guide - A+ (absolutley flawless); A (a masterpiece, near-perfect); A- (excellent); B+ (great); B (very good); B- (good); C+ (a mixed bag); C (average); C- (disappointing); D+ (bad); D (very bad); D- (absolutley horrendous); F (not one redeeming quality in this hunk of Hollywood feces).",Transporter 2
76,ruby_fff,"This one stands alone fine on its own, in spite of Transporter 1 or 3",7,2 October 2005,"There is hint of a possible ""Transporter 3."" In any case, ""Transporter 2"" is very much its own movie/story. Whether you've seen the previous Transporter (2002) it's no matter. If you like an action movie with visual drama, leaving plausibility aside (yes, a well-commented scene so 'precisely' executed with no room to ponder), Transporter 2 fits the bill. The story written by director Luc Besson, film directed by Louis Leterrier (also collaborated with Besson on ""Unleashed"" 2005 aka ""Danny the Dog"" with Jet Li, Morgan Freeman and Bob Hoskins) and Jason Statham in the lead role of Frank Martin - what's not to like? Statham is absolutely down to earth cool - seems like all stunts, even the amazing driving (and diving), were done by him.Statham's moves remind me of Jackie Chan's movies - surely, since the martial arts choreography is by Corey Yuen (who directed the first ""Transporter' 2002). Also felt touches of 007 James Bond as well. Simply enjoyed the use of fire hose segment - action sequences with fluid moves, humor and sheer satisfaction watching Statham single-handedly tackling the band of bad guys.The central villain in white suit is Alessandro Gassman as Gianni, having fighting machine Lola (feisty and viciously played by 5 foot 9 Kate Nauta) do his dirty work of chasing and killing. The counter-balance of human interest revolves around a little boy Jack (played by Hunter Clary) - it's all because our hero Frank promised Jack that no harm will come to him and 'Frank breaks NO promise!' In spite of the story's suspense pacing and non-stop action, Bresson did not forget the heart-warming thread, and the kidnapped Jack became the bridge to his parents' (Amber Valletta and Matthew Modine) strained marriage after all.A dash of French delight is François Berléand (the hypnosis doctor in ""Seventh Heaven"" 1997) as Tarconi, the French inspector 'friend' to Statham's undercover-transporter. Berléand's role offers humor relief, French cuisine and accents notwithstanding. Besson must had fun writing this one, as his other deliveries: ""La Femme Nikita"" 1991, ""The Professional"" 1994, ""Wasabi"" 2001.",Transporter 2

78,PyrolyticCarbon,"Strong Statham performance and excellent fight scenes, but a comically over the top series of stunts drag this movie down.",4,6 December 2005,"The Transporter had a great idea for a movie and a superb character to build upon. A man who transported any type of goods for anyone, no questions asked, followed his own set of strict rules, and could seriously kick ass if anything got in his way. The premise was superb, and the movie The Transporter was a seriously good fun action movie that had some over the top and insane stunts you could hardly believe but were superbly entertaining. Then there was Jason Statham who looked great, sounded fantastic, and did a damn fine performance in the role. It was what it was, a great fun action movie.I wanted to like this film for a number of reasons, firstly that I really do like Statham and think he's so playing beneath himself, secondly I really did enjoy the first movie, and thirdly because I have exchanged emails with one of the actresses in the movie and wanted to say good things about it. I can say that the actress in question, AnnaLynne, was not only stunningly good looking, but her brief appearance was good and funny. The rest of the movie however, struggled.Since I'm talking cast here, let me address the other strong point of this movie, Mr Statham. He's awesome, and that just cannot be said enough. He looks great on screen, acts very well, and carries this role off to perfection. He also looks like a great stunt guy, doing many of his own martial arts moves and fights, this adds a hell of a lot to a movie when the actor gets involved and puts some muscle behind the role. I really do like him as an actor, and I hope his career is not being syphoned off into a drain with such movies as Revolver, The Pink Panther (remake) (I find it hard to forgive an Englishman for appearing in this remake) and Dungeon Siege.There are also strong performances from Alessandro Gassman, Amber Valletta and François Berléand. It's Berléand that also reprises his role from the first movie and provides the action hero with his comic sidekick, interestingly the two never meet until the end of the movie, but his role provides much laughter and essential points of plot development.The opening scenes show us the Transporter back to his glory of the former film, following his rules, transporting his goods, and mixes light relief with action well. There are some excellent fight scenes when Martin is pitched against the odds with multiple baddies and multiple props, the scene with the firehose is just excellent to watch, but then things go downhill.Even during some excellent fight scenes there are just reams of fast cuts and closeups that leave you wondering what just happened, I have to say it's not as bad as some (mainly because Statham has trained and can do these stunts so that the camera can pull out) but it's still bad.Then there are some stunts, particularly with the car, that are so stupidly executed people laughed out loud in the cinema, and not in that funny-haha way, but in that oh lord, that's so bad it's laughable way. I would say all in all there are about five moments...no six...okay, seven moments like this throughout the movie, and they are so bad their affect is outwith the scene they are in and actually ruins the movie. Seriously, the final stunt is the daftest. It's wrong, ludicrous, preposterous, and resulted in audible groans of disapproval from the cinema.One of the problems is that the reality aspect has been totally avoided here, sure you can crank it up a bit, but this has been ramped even past the realms of comic action, and with that they've resorted to CGI and effects and in an action movie that's not so good. As I've always said you need to show the action, pull the camera back, stop cutting and close-ups, and show the audience what's really happening, whether it be car stunts or people fighting.Even my mate Pablo was laughing at how poor some of these scenes are and he loves dumb movies! He pointed out that the car spin in the Bond movie, Live and Let Die had a more believable car spin jump...and he's right, and the reason was it was real. That and it was actually possible! Saying that there are some really good stunts, particularly in the driving scenes, and seeing Martin in the Ferrari is just a boys moment for sure. Or the scenes in the Dentist office, or just of Martin fighting with people, these are good action scenes. The movie does has tons of style, but is just lacking in content. It is actually a boys movie, cool cars, cool dude, over the top stunts, cool guns, and superb looking ladies.I just think think if they had cranked down the insanity level on the stunts, pulled them slightly more to reality, relied less on the Hollywood style of filming fight sequences, they could have had a much better action movie. Let me say it again, they have an excellent premise here in the guise of the Transporter himself, how can they ruin it so easily?",Transporter 2

This 007-like role can only be played by a Brit, and Statham does an excellent job. In this sequel Martin takes a job for a friend as the driver for a rich couple and bonds with their son. The son is kidnapped triggering Martin's training. An action film that doesn't have much meaningful dialog, but just enough to make the characters interesting. Very well choreographed and exciting fight scenes  albeit not very believable  that's not what this film is about. Good, relatively clean, fun with some nice twists as the transporter tries to return to his simple lifestyle.",Transporter 2
81,diac228,A good mindless action flick that does a good job in matching the original,7,6 September 2005,"The mindless action flick is the kind of film that can get away with a lot of flaws, because in the end the film has only one purpose, to entertain. The movie is never intended to make you think, to make you aware of what is going on in the world, it only wants to entertain. Jackie Chan is responsible for some of the greatest mindless action films of all time. Legend of Drunken Master is one of the most entertaining movies I have ever seen in my life, despite the bad acting, the bad dubbing, and the weak plot. No matter though, because it is one heck of a movie; the final 20 minutes contains some of the best fighting ever captured on film. Rumble in the Bronx is also a fantastic film despite its flaws because for almost two hours it provides awesome fight scenes and also a good amount of humor.The Transporter had all the elements of a mindless action flick, a worthless plot, a lot of action, incredible stunts and fights, several forgivable flaws, a cool hero to root for all the way, and also a rather anticlimactic ending. The Transporter 2 was looking like it was delivering more of the same, except for more over-the-top moments. In the end, the sequel does not surpass the first, nor does it take a step backwards. Transporter 2 in terms of quality is just like the first one, and depending on the person it can be a good thing or a bad thing. In my case, it most certainly is a good thing. What keeps it from surpassing the original though is the fact that the producers decide to rely on special effects a bit too much.This time, we find The Transporter, Frank Martin, in Miami, driving a child to and from school, as a favor. Things go wrong when on a doctor's visit, he becomes ambushed and the child is kidnapped. For the rest of the film, Frank Martin tries to rescue the child, leading to even more complications about something that is much bigger than just a kidnapping. That is the plot, got it? Now forget the plot, and watch the film. In the 88 minutes, this movie contains more action than the typical action film that is usually almost 40 minutes longer. This I find is great, because nowadays movies drag way too long, even if they are decent (Wedding Crashers and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory suffers from this unfortunately). This movie contains more action and less pointless drama than Star Wars Episode 3, and Episode 3 is almost twice as long as this film.Action is everywhere in this film, at times over-the-top, at times jaw-dropping, and at times simply unbelievable. For starters, the CGI is so pathetic it's not even funny. One would wonder if this was done on purpose. Whether it is the awful airplane at one point in the film or the really fake-looking explosion surrounding a helicopter, it was pretty bad. The airplane in the movie Airplane looked more realistic. Also, some moments just made you ponder whether it is even possible a human being could do that; best example is jumping up and having two cars heading towards him crash. But hey, if James Bond and Neo can get away with over-the-top stuff, why can't Frank? Either way, the fight scenes were spectacular, perfectly done, and was not chopped up like crazy or involved crazy camera-work. Fight after fight you could see it all happen, with no trouble at all. The best fight in the movie has got to be the one with the fire hose, and the one before, when all the villains grabbed different weapons and still had trouble.Another thing The Transporter 2 gets away with is the terrible acting, even though Jason Statham was not that bad. Everyone else in the movie aside from the main villains and the main character were awful when it comes to acting. Kate Nauta, this newcomer, who was recently a model, has some scene-stealing moments. She does a great job playing this crazy, psycho assassin whose idea of a good time is very unique; and she looks pretty good, in a psychotic, creepy kind of way. François Berléand is here the second time around only for some comic relief, and he does deliver though, he has some of the better lines in the movie, what helps is that the dialogue in the film was not that great, but hey it is forgivable (everyone seems to forgive Star Wars I-III in this department). The ending was not as anti-climactic as the original, and gives us a better look at Frank Martin's character.Bottom Line: Have fun, forget the flaws, and just watch the film. Jason Statham has a lot of potential in being the next big action star, but America really has to give him a chance. Transporter 2 is a great movie, despite the flaws, and despite the awful CGI. If they want to improve the franchise, they should cut the drama, and ante up on the action and driving, after all, we are watching a Transporter in action. The fights are just amazing, among the best since Legend of Drunken Master, released over a decade ago. Transporter 2: good, visually appealing popcorn flick that all should enjoy, just be sure to leave your brain at home.",Transporter 2
82,rowmorg,Supposed to have made $11 million profit,5,20 September 2013,"Two tired themes in this picture: a kidnapping (yawn) and an evil virus (red) and its remedy (blue). The credits list a fights choreographer and a car-scenes choreographer and essentially that's what the film is: their scenes glued together with a little bit of dialogue. Sorry, I don't find Miami, Fl, at all glamorous any more and it's so hard to make a BMW (or even a Maserati) speeding down its streets look exciting that the choreographers have to reach really deep for special effects and super smash-ups. The Asian-style combat scenes are all equally ridiculous because the fighters never have guns or are disarmed within seconds. One scene is pretty inventive with a fire-hose, I must admit. But the scenes with the ridiculously costumed Lola (Kate Nauta) and her skinny bod are grotesque. She never hits Frank (Jason Statham) with her twin super-pistols, although she is dead-eyed with everyone else. Finally she gets pinioned on a spiky thing (no idea what it was), definitely dead. The struggle between Frank and the bad guy on the 'plane at the end was sheer lunacy/fantasy and went too far for me to suspend disbelief, I'm afraid.

86,jldmp1,Zero Percent Body Fat,6,2 March 2006,"This seems to be the trend for sequels in the beat 'em up/blow 'em up genre...cut away as much 'excess' as possible, and whittle it all down to the shortest film necessary to get the plot across -- and thereby maximize the number of times per day the film can be projected. This was pioneered by Stallone in ""Cobra"".This part was competently carried out; everything visual is told in extreme shorthand: it's the ""Italian Job"" in Miami.The problem is Statham. When Jackie or Arnold take on these things, it's always self-effacing; they know how to engage an audience. Quick witted actors like Bruce Willis know how to place their own little 'movie' within the movie -- Willis in particular knows how to have a dialogue with the viewer while the larger movie progresses. But Statham is a goon, a meathead. He has no clue as to how to play this any way other than perfectly arrow-straight. The first time, opening up a can of whupass was the fun...here, the can's already been used up and the fun's gone.He could learn some lessons from Berleand, who Leterrier places here to play the part of Leterrier himself...to see Americans through french eyes and build jokes off of that.

I like it when a movie just goes for it and doesn't care about credibility or anything. This movie, just like the first movie, doesn't take place in the real world. It is in a fantasy world where a guy can do amazing stunts both on foot and with any vehicle he drives, especially how he gets rid of a car bomb attached to the bottom.. We're living in troubled times and this movie provides an escape from that world for two hours. On that level, I enjoyed this movie.

89,rparham,Transport to fun,7,28 October 2005,"In the genre of action films, there are those that take themselves seriously and those that are willing to thumb their nose at convention and create an experience that is not really within the confines at the reality that we all live in. Transporter 2 is one of the latter. It is set in a world where the main character, a tough-as-nails, but cool as ice driver for hire can find himself in almost any situation that would leave another human being dead as a doornail and he escapes unscathed. Many films would be incapable of pulling this off, but Transporter 2 is fun romp that doesn't take itself too seriously and manages to entertain at the same time.I must honestly admit to not being much of a fan of the original Transporter, a film which had similar elements to this sequel, but by the end of the movie had pushed itself to such ridiculous levels of incredulity as to leave you rolling your eyes. Transporter 2 is also patently ridiculous, but this time director Louis Leterrier (who did not direct the original) manages to keep the movie flowing and it's infectious fun manages to overpower the moments that lead our rational brain to say ""What the . . "".Once again, Jason Statham is Frank Martin, a ""Transporter"", who moves a customer's valuables from one location to another. He asks no questions about his cargo, keeping to a code that allows him professional detachment. Frank has taken up a temporary job to help out a friend by transporting the son of a U.S. Senator (Mathew Modine). Frank has taken a liking to the boy (Hunter Clary), while his mother, Audrey (Amber Valletta), has taken a liking to Frank. In the midst of this, an international thief for hire, Gianni (Alessandro Gassman), assisted by his borderline dominatrix associate, Lola (Kate Nauta), have kidnapped the son, Jack, with the intention of holding him for ransom, and also making it appear that Frank had a hand in it at the same time. Frank escapes the kidnappers, only to start to believe that there is more to the kidnapping than meets the eye.Transporter 2 is one of those films that should come with the warning label to check your brain at the door. Lots of things happen in Transporter 2 that are outside the boundaries of reality. Cars defy gravity, human beings perform incredible stunts and survive and people are often in the right place at the right time. Yet, the film has a strong charm that is hard to ignore. A lot comes from the presence of Jason Statham. He is all business as Frank Martin, and he cements the film with his no-nonsense attitude. Statham is the epitome of cool in this film, and that is just what it needs. We can't not help but root for this man at the center of the film, and our interest in seeing him pull himself out of his scrapes is at times just plain exhilarating. Alessandro Gassman has just the right amount of bravado to be fun as the villain and Kate Nauta seems to be channeling a punk rock superstar as a deadly, but sexy assassin.The film's action, while borderline impossible, is engaging and well-staged. Unlike many recent action films that over-edit their action, director Leterrier keeps everything decipherable and the adrenaline pumping. The fight scenes, choreographed by fight-master extraordinaire, Corey Yuen, are as good as anything in recent martial-arts action movies, with a lean towards slightly more realism than, say, Hero or Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.If you are looking for some entertaining action and a good time at the movies, Transporter 2 is it.

He lives a nice and stress-free life, playing somewhat of a nanny by day and enjoying a beer or two on his time off.

When you want to turn off your brain and simply soak up as much high-octane action as you can, this is exactly the kind of movie you should be searching for. The action is outrageous and defies physics, but none of that matters in a movie like this. If you can check logic at the door, the film will reward you all the more for it. You also don't need to be very well-versed in the previous film, as not only is the character of Frank Martin re-established well enough, but also because Jason Statham plays essentially the same role in every film he does. As always, he is in top form, charming and intense as the hero du jour. The film is host to some over-the-top performances from its villains and some ridiculous action scenes (get a load of how Martin rids his car of a bomb!) but is brilliant, stylish and energetic.

91,monkeysgalore,One of Statham's Craziest Movies,8,10 April 2020,"One of the trashiest, most brainless action movies ever, but it's so OTT and crazy, and it has Statham. I originally had it at 3 stars, but I bumped up to 7 instead for the insanity and Statham.This movie is crazy. This one is like the Double Team (1997) or Knock Off (1998) of Statham's career (that's a compliment). It basically takes everything from the first movie and turns it up to 11. It seems like a parody, and on that level, it really works.I mean this just doesn't seem like it was meant to be taken seriously. There's a fight scene where Statham uses watermelons as boxing gloves, a scene where he flips his car in the air so that a hook hanging above manages to snag the bomb attached to the bottom of his car and pull it off. It also has this crazy fight scene with a hose, some more crazy fight scenes, and a henchwoman who constantly chases and shoots at Statham with guns that have apparently infinite ammo, and she does this all in lingerie. If I haven't driven home how completely mad this movie is, Statham fights a dude in a plane, which crashes underwater, and neither him or the other guy get hurt, and they keep fighting.The action sequences are so astonishingly OTT that they're impossible not to love. The super cool hospital scene, the police car chase, the car scene at the docks, the watermelon fight scene, the huge gang fight scene, the hose fight scene, the house fight scene, the mansion fight, and the final fight are all great. And I think there's another car chase. The action is so ramped up and relentless.You have to give this movie credit for how deliriously self-indulgent and entertaining it is. The girl is so over-sexualized, the action so preposterous, it's all so fun.Jason Statham carries the movie. He's as cool and charismatic as ever. The villain was forgettable. Kate Nauta is horrible and looks like she'd struggle to play herself. Her lines are so painful you might need aspirin. I liked Amber Valletta, and it was cool to see Keith David.Overall, not as good as the original, but just as fun. It's glorious over-the-top and super action-packed. It probably has the most fighting and car-related action of the three too. It's the very definition of a mindless action movie, but the goal is to be entertained, right?

Jason Statham reprises the role of Frank Martin, a driver with impressive skills in or out of his car. The 2nd film is at least as silly as the first, and not quite as corny in the script, making it a very entertaining way to pass 80 minutes.Obviously the aim of the film is to capture some of the style of ""Golden Era"" Hong Kong action films, and Jason Statham does a great job with the help of Cory Yuen's choreography, which is very imaginative and clever (though he reuses a few ideas, e.g. the hosepipe from KISS OF THE DRAGON). Unfortunately the film is blighted by ""Hollywood-Style"" camera work and editing, which detracts from the choreography... westerners still haven't learnt how to shoot a fight scene as well as a Hong Kong crew (despite having 10x the budget available to do it)... too many closeups, shaky camera that goes against the movement of the action and editing which obscures rather than emphasises what's going on.

94,blacklist-1,A better sequel. This is good trashy fun.,6,7 August 2010,"I didn't like the first Transporter but my dad who loves the films propelled me to give the sequel a go and as it turns out this was enjoyable tosh and actually good trashy fun. Yes the script and dialogue is still cheesy with little character or plot development but the action is even more enjoyable than the first with some terrific stunts, nice scenery and great soundtrack music.What propelled me to give this a higher rating was the acting, which is much better. Jason Statham has improved vastly since the first one and has more emotion in his voice. Francois Berleand who returns as Inspector Tarconi provides the comic element and is much more entertaining in this as he has more to do. But the revelation is Amber Valletta who played the mother Audrey Billings. Her acting was terrific (which is surprising for a film like this). You feel the love and worry she has for her son when he is kidnapped. She has been under-rated in this and deserves more praise. She gives the movie more heart and emotion. All in all I enjoyed this more than the first as the acting has improved and dare I say this had heart.",Transporter 2
95,Jakealope,The Only Thing that Makes it Worthwhile is Jason Statham,4,22 September 2005,"with his cool cockney attitude. You can like him and he makes the best out of a harebrained, cliché ridden infantile plot. Basically, the movie is all impossible stunts, the Matrix in Miami today. But Statham's non Bond performance is so much more watchable than wooden Keanu's Neo. Here is an example of the silly stunts that make it so ridiculous; the bad guys place a bomb under his car which he discovers by it's reflection in another car's window. So they let him drive away so they can remote detonate it. Instead of looking for some bump or obstacle to knock it off, it's only held on by magnets, he pulls this amazing corkscrew barrel roll in mid air so that the hook on a construction crane can knock it off 20' in the air. Get it now? The car, some hopped up V-12 Audi, is almost the co-star. Then throw in his culinary orientated French friend for laughs, along with a crew of demented Russian bio war creeps and some Italian Kung Fu master evil lord type, and you can guess this is not ripped from the headlines like Law and Order. Final stupid stunt, the good and bad guy fight in an out of control jet and when it crashes into the water in a dive, the shock doesn't turn them to jelly. Of course, the evil guy has to be saved by Mr Good so they can use his blood to save his little boy charge and the kid's obnoxious powerlunch parents. Basically, there is this incredibly complex plot to infect all these anti drug big wigs by infecting the kid; who'd spread it to his father then to everyone else. Since the virus is spread through coughing and they have the antidote, you'd think they could just send one of their infected guys to cough on the kid in public. But no, the geniuses have to murder the kid's doctor and nurse in a real brutal way and impersonate them so imperfectly that our cockney Bond sees right through itSaccharine!",Transporter 2
96,bob-rutzel,This Rocks,6,26 January 2006,"Frank Martin (Statham) does a favor for a friend by driving a young boy of wealthy parents back and forth to school. Seems simple enough, but you know something is going to go wrong. You just know.Yes, the story is well worn. This is a kidnapping. Oh hum. But, wait a minute, watch how Frank goes about rescuing the kidnapped. This movie is all about the stunts and it doesn't disappoint. The fighting choreography is simply outstanding, and the other special effects need to be recognized also. Watch Frank go from a speeding car to a light plane taking off. Unbelievable. Well, stunt men were probably used but even so, unbelievable.Look out Spiderman, there's a new kid in town and he is doing good. Spiderman is cool and Statham, as Frank, is cool too. The way Statham moves tells us he may not have any bones in his body. What a contortionist. This movie is better than Transporter 1 and that was very good too.Get past the dialogue, and the annoying acting of some, and just wait for the action to start and when it does, it's almost non-stop, but never boring and the stunts don't go on forever and ever.

Jason Statham and the rest of the cast go through the motions in a tired Miami-based 007 retread, all guns and gadgets and very little of what made the first film so entertaining. The car chases and fight scenes all look stagey and the use of CGI is too obvious. It's hard to believe that Luc Besson would even think of lending his name to this grubby little film, but there he is in the credits. The man clearly has no shame. Someone else with no shame is Kate Nauta, who plays a sub-Bond villainess with all the sexiness of a hatstand, despite spending most of the movie semi-naked, tricked out in high heels and some sort of combat body harness. All I can say about her role is that she must have been offered a lot of money.I managed to sit all the way through ""Transporter 2"" but it was more in hope than due to any entertainment value. 'Surely it'll pick up soon,' I kept telling myself, but this was a forlorn hope.

Directed by Louis Leterrier Written by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen Produced by Luc Besson Rated PG-13 for language, violence and sexuality Absurdity is taken to a whole new level in this wasted vehicle for hot boy Jason Statham. Reprising his role from the first one as Frank Martin a special kind of ""driver"" whose current mission is chauffeuring a high profile child ""Pacifier"" style. The kid of course ends up being kidnapped which culminates in a bunch of ridiculously over the top, across the mountain, down the river action sequences. Striking very similar to this year's supreme action bomb the horrid XXX state of the union. The only thing this film has going for it is Jason Statham, hard bodied and charismatic as ever but it's not enough to save the film from falling into utter boredom. The first Transporter worked because of Stathams presence, his kick ass attitude and explosive sex appeal. The original film was already quite unbelievable but ultimately entertaining and cool. This one is ten times more unbelievable and just not cool. the same thing that grounded the XXX sequel in it's laughable territory from it's mediocre predecessor. What this film does have that XXX 2 didn't is Jason Statham. Because Ice Cube is absolutely no substitute. Which drives this overall film from the tall turkey category to a watchably laughable one instead. I'm not going to even touch the acting which ranges from presence( Statham) to bad (Modine) to awful (Valetta) to absolutely horrid (Nauta and Gassman). However Nauta really takes the cake here with masculine and unattractive features. Coupled with her annoying one liners, lack of sex appeal or any appeal at all. She delivers one of the most annoying and overly contrived characters ever appearing on film. She's that bad. As for the people involved like the wonderful Luc Besson whose producing skills can go either way and the director of the magnificent Unleashed Louis Leterrier fail themselves and their fans with wads of wasted potential. And as for the sequences which range from flying out windows to catch antidotes in mid air during traffic, riding a water surfer on dry land in traffic, knocking a bomb off the bottom of your car mid air with a hanging construction hook and a horrid opening sequence that doesn't even make any sense. It's pretty skippable people but if you must, entertain a DVD rental and leave your money stacked firmly in your pocket. Cause this wasted vehicle is out of gas and the scary thing is they leave an opening for a follow up sequel.

Jason Statham has yet another chance to assert his dominance as an invincible professional, a man of many skills and he does it from the first seconds of the movie.This time though the intensity grows even bigger with a desire to put everything in the shades of yellow. Somehow the story seems plausible but extremely exaggerated. Outlandish tricks performed by none other than ""Master of physics hiding under the mask of great driving"" Frank Martin ruined quite a bit of scenes for me. Knowing that he can dodge everything that flies in his direction, survive the hardest of the falls and simply kick all the butts around sends a warning signal that boredom is on the way.I am not a fan of crazy villains as they are just a treasure for writers - can do what they want and defy all the logic. This movie is quite a good example of this, a messy enemy causes unreasonable mayhem simply to justify some additional explosions...The wish to make Frank a hero of a bigger scale that he already is also leads to some solid plot holes and useless threats.As follows from my rant, I the sequel is okay but I strongly believe that compared to the original it lacks the credibility that greatly increases the connection with a character, so this experiment proved itself wrong in my eyes.",Transporter 2

109,Skragg,Completely unbelievable (and good for it),7,28 July 2006,"Slight spoiler (if any). My problem with most adventure movies nowadays is that they're unbelievable without really being ""escapist."" This one isn't afraid to be - apart from the obvious ""human drama"" side, about protecting the little boy, it's PURE escapism. But in one area (for me) more than any. The Lola character, played by Kate Nauta, is such a completely over-the-top villainess (making the other characters seem down-to-earth by comparison), that you almost have to either roll your eyes through every scene she's in, or be very glad that some movies still HAVE such characters ; one extreme or the other. All her scenes with Frank, including the big showdown with him, are like this, putting the movie in a kind of ""Bond"" territory. Including her ""weird chick"" version of kissing him in the car. And that's another thing - I don't know the first ""Transporter"" movie, so I don't know if this would've been really out of place, but considering HOW over-the-top the Lola character is, I think it could have worked for the story to have an actual ""Bond girl"" kind of romantic scene between her and Frank. Anyway, even though I have nothing against those zillions of ""empowered"" women in adventure films nowadays (heroic ones, I mean), they have become a real cliché, so it's nice to see a ""bad girl"" of this kind for a change. This movie also had a comic relief character (more than one, really) that I think really worked (and I often think THOSE are a distraction).",Transporter 2

112,TimBoHannon,Succeeds everywhere the first film failed,7,6 March 2007,"When I reviewed the original Transporter, I had many complaints. My reason for disliking it was threefold. First, the acting was dull, second, the latter half of the film defeated its own cause, and third, the action was campy because nobody ever stayed down for the count. Understandably, I was apprehensive when I put the second episode into my DVD player.I liked the first part of The Transporter, and this film opens exactly like its predecessor. The camera pans around Frank Martin's sports car, we see Martin (Jason Statham) inside, his watch beeps at an exact minute, and he enters his ignition code. Then the unexpected happens. A cheerleader taps on his window, asking for help. Viewers looking for the famous moment from the trailer when Martin halts a fight to take his recently dry-cleaned suit coat off will not have to wait; it happens here.In fact, he has three spare suits in his trunk in case the one he is wearing becomes soiled. He also has three spare cell phones. Such clever devices are only a few of film's many small pleasures.Once again the film channels its past. The building he stops at possesses an uncanny resemblance to the bank from the first film, but it turns out to be something much more innocent--a Miami school.His ""package"" this time is a grade school boy, Jack Billings (Hunter Clary), and his destination is the boy's house. His father, Jefferson (Matthew Modine), is the controversial leader of the top narcotics agency in the United States. He has been separated from his wife Audrey (a surprisingly beautiful Amber Valetta), for a year, yet they are living together for the time being (the reason is never explained, a minor flaw).Even though Frank has only taken this job as a favor, he has bonded with Jack, and Jack with him. He sees Jefferson and Audrey arguing, so he positions the car so Jack is unable to see it. He enjoys playing a guessing game with Jack as he drives him. When Jack is worried about receiving a shot, Frank promises the he will never let anybody hurt him. He even has a new set of rules. This is not the detached, amoral Frank of the first film.All of this is merely a setup for the moment when the film begins its non-stop action phase. It begins when Jack is kidnapped. Martin's fourth rule is to never make a promise he can't keep, and he has no intention of breaking his rules this time. The police are called, but Martin quickly realizes he is on his own and will have to solve the mystery by himself. It is at this point where Transporter II separates itself from the pack.Some of the sequences in the first film were so dubious the illusion was ruined, but the action here manages to be both more and less realistic at the same time. There are multiple chases, by car, on foot, on the water, by car again and in the air. Every one of them is beautifully created and photographed, but director Louis Letterier makes certain that nothing is taken too seriously. Francois Berleand even returns for effective comic relief, and lends Frank a little help along the way. There are stunts of every kind that are both wonderful and wonderfully impossible. Each one grabs the viewers' attention like a metal claw. There is one scene where Martin neutralizes a set of guards with a fire hose. There is another where two men wrestle while being tossed about inside a falling airplane. We feel tempted to laugh aloud, but are at the same time wowed by the skill, imagination and insanity of it all. If the film is anything, it is fun, and everybody involved seems to be having the time of their lives making it.The action is also more believable because the characters are vulnerable. In the first film, every thug was invincible. This time around, people die, jars break, and good punches are felt. When Martin is confronted by an enemy or group of enemies, there is no one else waiting around the corner. The original Transporter had infinite reinforcements. Problem corrected, and thankfully so.The emotional content is higher than usual. Statham plays Martin stoically, but like Rick Blaine in Casablanca, he is a sentimentalist at heart. Statham is not asked to do nearly as much as Humphrey Bogart was, yet within the confines of the script, he is equally successful. Amber Valetta is convincing as the hurting housewife. ""I'm so lost and confused,"" she laments to Martin early in the film. ""Who isn't?"" he replies. Meaningful relationships are built more effectively here than in many longer films.I will say nothing further about the plot in specific terms because it is so ingenious. It continues to show new wrinkles well into the climax, and a second viewing illustrates just how well every element fits together. Alessandro Gassman plays the villain, and brings him to life successfully. Kate Nuata leaves a lasting impression as the minimally clothed, mentally unstable, heavily mascaraed villainess.In summary, the sheer creativity of Transporter II makes the film. There is even a moment where two people are pointing guns in the other's face. If properly aimed, one could fire and the other would be killed instantly, but of course nobody ever does. In a film like this, it is all part of the fun.",Transporter 2

I'm willing to suspend disbelief to a large extent on a movie like this, especially for the action sequences (its astounding that Audi still looks brand new and unscratched at the end), but this movie couldn't even get the basics right. For instance, was the kid in this adopted? He's supposed to be the child of Amber Valletta and Matthew Modine (who's slipped a long way, by the way)? Did they check out his ethnicity before hiring him, or think nobody would notice that he seems to be Latino? What the...?

Both Transporter movies have quite great soundtracks with nice instrumental tracks working as the background music for the action.

The final battle is inside an airplane and completely anti-climatic with a really bad CGI airplane. They shouldn't have shown any view from outside the plane.

Like the first Transporter, this is a very fun movie to watch. There is plenty of action to be had, and the bits with the French Inspector are light and humorous as a nice break. The fight scene with the fire-hose was probably the top. Don't miss it!I will be critical of a few things, however. 1.) if you recall the trailers/previews of the first movie, there is a scene which (thankfully) failed to make the cut to the final release version of the film, where a rocket launched at our hero is redirected thanks to a small piece of stovepipe. One of those things that might look interesting but ultimately came off as stupid, and it was very good that this did not make it into the movie. Unfortunately, other such stunts similar were kept IN this movie. The bomb-under-the-car removal stunt particularly stands out in this vein. Most of the ending airplane-under-water scenes also fit this category.2.) Remember that European sensibilities permeate this film. After all, it is made by Europeans. That means they think a spiky haired, heroin-addict-skinny with impossible amounts of mascara chick with bad skin is somehow 'sexy'. Her romp through a good portion of the movie in a bra and pantie set with a double should holster rig for her customized Glock18's should have gone out after 'Barb Wire', but alas their never-say-die attitudes gave it another go.And don't even look for continuity! Cars that got shot up in one scene amazingly show up pristine in the next. Our female villain manages a few hundred rounds out of 30-round magazines for her machine pistols, whom we actually do see her reload. ONCE. Still, like I said, it's a fun movie to see. Just don't spend a lot of money seeing it, and put a good portion of your brain on snooze and enjoy the ride!",Transporter 2
121,matjusm,Casual entertainment,6,17 September 2005,"A sequel to the sleeper hit The Transporter, this sequel goes as usual- same thing except bigger and grander. This time around the transporter (played by Jason Statham) is living in Miami and his current assignment is being the chauffeur for a wealthy family (mostly consists of him driving their kid around). But when some bad guys kidnap the kid, the blame goes on the transporter and he must work against the clock to make sure that justice is served. And most importantly, the kidnapping may not quite be what it seems... The action scenes go ever crazier and absurder as time goes by. Whoever thought them up sure deserves an Oscar for 'most absurd writing'. They are all fun and all but they really give logic the finger. Differently from the first movie, this film has less emphasis on driving and more on fights but a few nice chases are still present. The CGI that was used for some of these action scenes isn't of the highest caliber but good enough.A fun but wildly absurd film. 6/10",Transporter 2
122,the-evil-cult,Good Clean Action Movie,7,28 June 2006,"Transporter 2 stars Jason Stratham as a man whose job it is to transport things. In this movie we see him transporting the son of Mr Billings a government official. All of a sudden a group of people kidnap the little boy and then release him. However, as the transporter works out what happening he realized that the kidnapping is more than a kidnapping.The selling point from the movie is the action and it delivers very well. The car chases are very fast. Stratham's Audi doesn't just look good it also seems to drive well. In one scene he drives the car off a car park tower and into a level on a skyscraper. In another he flips the car upside down in the air to remove a bomb underneath. Unfortunately for this film the explosions suffer from computer-generated-flame syndrome.Stratham is also involved in some good fight scenes. He's able to climb things like trucks very quickly. Some of the fight scenes in which he fights several people have him taking on one person at a time. I'd really like to a see a movie in which the protagonist takes them all on simultaneously. It would require very fast moves but it would be far more realistic and interesting. The closest I've seen to this is in Police Story when Jackie Chan fights a group of people in a shopping mall.People die in this film that is no doubt but all the deaths are clean and sterile deaths, so most younger people shouldn't be put off too much.",Transporter 2

The camerawork does a nice job of allowing the audience to see each move too.

This flick has a serviceable plot, a stoic protagonist with a firm rule set, but is burdened with action sequences more unbelievable than Jackie Chan's and without Jackie's concomitant humor. The computer generated portions are at best cartoonish, while the events they depict completely defy all known laws of motion. One can gloss over most of the bogus car chase sequences, the one in the black Ferrari looks real enough, but the BS in the airplane stinks up the whole deal. I was very disappointed by the film. Involved, fairly well paced action plots are too rare to have them lost in such a morass of unrealistic and physically impossible sequences.",Transporter 2

This took the facts of what a car can do and threw them out the window.Not to mention what they did with the jet ski.Oh my god, do people REALLY believe these things are possible?? Like you can jump a car flip, it upside down, and strip a bomb off then land on all four wheels and drive away. WTF???Or crash through the safety wall of a parking ramp and land safely in the building under construction across the street?? How would you get down to ground floor, take the elevator?More mindless car stunts to sell a week stupid script. Here's a clue, if you jump a car you need a take off ramp and once the car lands you need a flat bed tow truck to haul the wreck away.",Transporter 2
126,happytoms,Not the greatest sequal but be open minded about it,7,5 November 2019,"I remember watching this movie when I was younger and I kinda remembered parts of but I kept procrastinating watching it again now because I kinda loved it when I was young. So finally came the day I finally decided to watch it and I must say even after all these years it's quite enjoyable.I want to talk about a few aspects of the movie.The story. ( Easy to watch, engaging.
It's not set in the beautiful French riviera anymore but across the ocean in Miami where we are once again reunited with Jason Statham in another action/crime packed movie. Time to time you can see references from the first movie and how Frank's life has changed since then. Feels like nothing can be resolved simply in this movie because even the smallest things have to be taken over the top to resolve them. At first I didn't liked that but watching it with an open mind I'm thinking who cares. It's just more of everything.
There are few one liners and one returning character who gave à comedic relief to all the action going on and I enjoyed it.
Personally I didn't enjoyed this movie as much we the original but all you need to make a good enough movie is likeable characters, kinda excellent bad guys, the right amount of action, fighting, stunts, cars exploding way too much for no reason, romance and one man against the world story and you have made an iconic movie. It doesn't work everytime. It did in the first one but not in this one sadly.Sound design - (Excellent. When I watched all the fight,action scenes the special effects gave a satisfying feedback in my ears when someone landed a punch or got knocked out. Everything music-wise felt just right like you would expect.)Cinematography (Feels like they thought about everything and it has that Transporter Miami vibe to everything.)Overall I think quite a lot of people will not enjoy it and quite a lot more will. Personally, after watching it this feels like not the greatest movie and not the worst one so it's somewhere in the middle around 7 out of 10.
Would recommend to anyone but it wouldn't be one of my first choices.",Transporter 2
127,ashecatlin,Probably the worst Jason Statham movie I've seen,3,2 August 2020,"This just wasn't a good movie, not even by Jason Statham standards. You get no closure for what happened in the first one with the lovely Asian, was actually surprised the cop for the first one was in this. Granted the role wasn't exactly much but it was nice to see him, his scenes might have actually been the best in the whole movie.The action sucked in this, it was even worse than the bloated third act of the first one. It's even more stupid but not a fun stupid like fast and furious or crank, it just annoyed me. Like there is a fight in a doctors office, to kidnap a kid but it doesn't go well obviously so when Frank takes the kid back to his parents they have a sniper targeting his head so that Frank (Jason Statham) can't do anything. What was the whole point of a 20 minute action scene when it adds nothing to the film, they get the kid and drug him with something that makes him highly contagious. Even if he breathes on them, they become infected. I honestly think that's a great idea, then Frank has to search for the cure. He injects one of the guys cronies and you can tell by the close up shots this guy gets right from the get go that he's the main henchman. That whole thing last for about 20 minutes but I quite liked that bit, heck would have easily given that a 5 stars but then the third act and it's back to being piss poor.There are so many things to hate about this movie, like the fact that credits at the beginning of the movie take up a whole 7 minutes, what the hell. You get a bit of Statham in between and then some city shots but the majority is credits it's just plain awful. Now I know the film is called transporter so I guess he has to stick at his job, it's nice that he's picking up a kid from school. I thought he learnt a nice lesson from the first film but then he said he's still doing dodgy stuff, just to his mum like it's no biggy what the hell.So I liked all the call backs to the first like the rules, the guy he's saying he's the cook like a girl in the first did, that's the thing the best things about this movie are the callbacks to the first. That's all this has going for it, even the girl on the cover annoys me. At first I thought he was a love interest but she's just the girl the big bad is banging, she like to walk around with big guns shooting everything up in a bra and knickers. Great, I didn't mention the big bad because he doesn't do anything, he gets a weird intro where he's doing kendo with people and overpower 7 of them at once but later on gets his ass handed to him easily even the henchmen put a a better fight then him, she didn't that she was just as bad.So in conclusion, interesting idea about virus and finding the cure. The only good bits aside from that are callbacks to the first and I kept on having to pause this movie to do stuff in between because it was that boring.",Transporter 2
128,tkdlifemagazine,Statham is the Film,6,6 November 2021,"Very much like the Road Warrior series this film take a low budget popular film and elevates it by budget and overall production value. Jason Statham is great in this stand alone sequel; however, there are some issues. The special effects are cheesy. There are many cool fight scenes. Very original in idea and well executed by Statham, but not well shot due to the lack of martial arts prowess on the part of his attackers. The cast is good. It keeps you engaged and foreshadowed the third part. Good, iconic, but not Statham's best in my opinion.",Transporter 2
129,trancejeremy,"Mindless and mostly entertaining, but ultimately forgettable",6,11 January 2006,"I liked the original Transporter. It was a nice mix of different action types - car chases, gunfights, and martial arts. While French, it had a heavy Hong Kong flavor, thanks to one of the directors (Corey Yuen) and one of the stars (the delectable Shu Qi), and so was somewhat over the top, but reasonably realistic. And all the stunts were actual stunts.Transporter 2 veers into comic book territory, dropping the gunfights (he does get shot at, but no shooting himself) in favor of more martial arts style fights (good, but where almost no one gets hurt) and drops realistic vehicle stunts in favor of lots and lots of mediocre quality CGI. If I wanted to see a CGI car jump over things, I'd play a video game.The plot starts off okay enough, but quickly devolves into silliness as well. Basically, the Transporter is chauffeuring a politician's kid as a favor to a friend. But the kid runs afoul of a kidnapping plot, and he is implicated for reasons that aren't that clear.Anyway, it is enjoyable in a mindless way. Jason Statham has a pretty good screen presence, and does a job job as the stoic Transporter. Most of the other acting is either bad or unremarkable. The kid's mother was pretty annoying, and the implausibly dressed villainess seemed to be channeling Bridgit Nielsen (not a good thing). Worth a rental.",Transporter 2

131,ultimatenexus,Arguably the Best of the Statham Trilogy,6,8 August 2014,"I didn't enjoy this movie the first time I'd seen it, but maybe that's because I didn't give it my full attention, because upon my second viewing, it was MUCH better than before. In fact, I might go so far as to say this is the best of the series so far. It's definitely better than the third one.Here we have Statham playing Frank, who's now the driver for the child of a wealthy family in Miami, bringing him to and from school on weekdays. Well, he's asked to drive the kid to the doctor's office for a routine check-up, but that doesn't end well. As it turns out, a bio-terrorist-for-hire is after the boy to get to his father, Jefferson, because of his government job, and although Frank gives them one hell of a chase, they manage to take the kid and hold him for ransom. Frank's determined to get him back, and stop the terrorist plot our villain's got in store for Jefferson and the politicians he'll be seeing at the summit.If you thought the first movie was ridiculous, this one beats it for sure. It's got ridiculousness in spades; gravity-defying car flips, more one man army fist fights, and one of the most amusingly creative ways to dispose of a bomb on the bottom of your car--while you're driving it.Seriously, it needs to be seen to be believed.",Transporter 2
132,BrigitteD,Won't transport you very far.,4,17 September 2005,"An inevitable sequel to its 2002 predecessor (which I have never seen), ""Transporter 2"" reintroduces its multi-purpose action hero, Frank Martin, whose driving and crime-fighting are all part of a regular day's work.Jason Statham is a debonair, albeit, inferior James Bond wannabe. Overall, he's not a very impressive actor, but as an action man, he's rather efficient in the material he's presented with.The material in question is nothing more than a montage of implausible stunt sequences and cartoon villains conjured from the creativity of director Louis Leterrier and French screenwriter Luc Besson, in the kind of child abduction avenging scenarios we have seen executed many times before, in a much better fashion.Seeming to borrow elements from one such example, ""Man On Fire"", Frank is assigned to chauffeur Jack (Hunter Clary), the young son of a wealthy couple (Amber Valetta, Matthew Modine), on his daily route to and from school. It is soon obvious that there's a strain in the couple's marriage, and beneath the wife's gratitude towards Frank, there is also an undercurrent of attraction as well.Soon, the boy is kidnapped by drug ring smugglers who intend to use Jack as a human weapon by injecting him with a lethal virus which would ultimately infect those around him.Suspecting that more than just a simple ransom demand is involved, Frank sets out to locate both the boy and obtain the antidote to the administered virus before it's too late.Because the whole premise is overly outrageous and because the villains are more slapstick than threatening, the viewers are never inclined to invest much sympathy towards the victims or any interest in the outcome.Otherwise, if you're looking for a last dose of mindless entertainment from the late summer's leftovers, or simply looking for a temporary substitute until the next James Bond installment, this film should be quite effective.",Transporter 2
133,james_norman1981,Dear oh dear,1,24 April 2006,"I have a confession to make... I enjoyed the first transporter film! It involved car chases, martial arts action and all sorts of implausible things that kept me entertained for the majority of the running time. It was relatively short, had some pretty cool moments and was generally a bit of ridiculous fun that needn't be taken too seriously, although the concluding chapter sold the first half short (the final fight and resolution of the movie left me thinking 'They're ending it like that...!?!').Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of the sequel, which suffers blisteringly from a syndrome I like to call sequilitis... a perilously common and highly contagious disease, with its epicentre in California. It leads to movies, which can be described at best as 'ok' or 'just above mediocre,' being unnecessarily dragged through another 90 minutes where everything is faster, bigger and more explosive. It can even happen to the better class of film, witness Godfather 3... Anyhow, here we have what may well become a test case to compare against all future sequels...Now I've once sat down to watch an Uwe Boll movie... I endured at least ten minutes of Plan 9 from Outer Space... Whoever made Lost in Space got £5 of my pocket money (circa 1998)... And I once watched an entire episode of Corination street... All these were experiences I have tried, and failed, to forget, from the awfulness of the dialogue to the woodenness of the acting, the preposterous scenarios and the long list of other problems they all share. It is now time for me to add another 'film' to that list: Transporter 2.This movie lacks just about any redeeming features. Clearly none of the production crew have even heard of the concept of physics while the director, who was also responsible for the Luc Besson penned snore-fest Danny the Dog (titled 'Unleashed' in the UK), doesn't seem to have the slightest clue as to what he's meant to be doing. He merges CG that a kid with an Etchersketch could improve upon with gun play that John Woo would say 'Now come on, that's really too over the top!' His wardrobe department deserve to be taken out and shot while the casting people may be lucky to escape such a fate...Everything about this film sucks and Luc Besson would do well to stop penning any more of this dreary garbage. He's turned his once promising career into a litany of cinematic trash, producing, writing and being involved in dozens of films a year, none of which are worth watching. This isn't even the most recent catastrophe, with Revolver, Angel A and many other poorly planned rush jobs helping to fill videostore bargain bins across the world. The director of Leon and Nikita really should know better.So too should everyone else involved. An audience really isn't going to accept that a car can fly upside down, clip a bomb on a passing crane, land on the other side of a bleeding one hundred foot wide (maybe more) river as the bomb explodes... and then drive off into the next scene... it's not just impossible it's insultingly preposterous and the dodgy CG only serves to further deny us any feeling that we're watching a film crafted with any degree of love or skill.Instead we're inundated with ridiculous notion after ridiculous notion... implausible scenario after implausible scenario... and so on and so forth. From a female villain who goes out in nothing more than lingerie, a see through shirt and two fully automatic, laser sighted, silenced pistols, to a horrendously unsympathetic family who you practically want to die of a biologically impossible disease... no one emerges with any credit.The exception, to a very small extent, is Jason Statham and it is he who gives the movie its only all right moments. Called upon to do nothing more than pretend to drive, look moody and occasionally beat people up, he shows as limited a range as he did in the first film... but is hardly being called upon to do much more. A couple of the car chases are OK, one or two of the 'one men versus a lot of other people' fights are quite cool and his demeanour throughout does allow us to believe that his character, Frank Martin, really would take this course of action. Other than that it's nothing but bad news...Matthew Modine is wondering where his career disappeared to... Amber Valletta clearly regrets getting involved... Kate Nauta will not be gracing any films soon (God willing)... and the rest of the cast are generally asking themselves quite how they became embroiled in such an awful movie, Keith David and Francois Berleand, for example, are two men way above this kind of crap. Overall I can't warn you enough not to see this film, it's got practically nothing to recommend it and you'll only feel cheated of 87 minutes of your life (plus whatever the cost of the rental). Please don't waste your time... it's far more precious than this pile of rubbish.",Transporter 2
134,Mrswing,(mild possible spoilers) It must be nice to be Luc Besson...,1,31 August 2005,"... You can dream up any utterly crap screenplay idea, write it in less than a month, have no one tell you it's no good, and get it made. This one has all the hallmarks: a ridiculous non-story without any semblance of coherence, spastic editing which obscures almost all of the action, 'characters' which are almost too simplistic even for a dumb comic book... It's really disheartening. The truly bad: the CGI-work which was often very badly done (tv-series level), Katie Nauta's psychotic slut who only lives for killing and/or screwing everyone she meets (with a decided preference for the former), some sequences which are simply incomprehensible, François Berléand who's even less necessary to the plot than in the first one, the climax which is so completely unrealistic (both action-wise and emotionally) that it completely throws you out of whatever hold the picture still had on you at that point, the editing which ruins just about every fight scene and chase, the total lack of narrative coherence.The somewhat okay to good: the Audi car, Amber Valetta as the only human character in the film, Jason Statham's cool, and the fight in the garage which almost let you make out what was happening, and had some neat tricks and moves. Though even here the old '70s kung fu movie staple of having a lot of villains stand around in a circle and wave their weapons in a threatening way while attacking the hero one by one was so noticeable that even my wife (who hasn't seen ANY of these flicks) immediately noticed it.Luc Besson - the Prequel-trilogy George Lucas of Europe, but with only half the talent (at best).

The choreography was brilliant and stunning to watch. I am amazed at how many stunts Jason Statham did. It must have been so hard. I mean it is great that an actor does his own stunts because it makes the film so much better. Great martial arts. I'm glad they didn't put music with all the fights scenes because i think that would have wrecked it. Most of the acting was great. But the only thing that let the film down a bit was their special effects. At some stages it was good but at one point it looked so bad. The part when Lola shoots down the helicopter was just poor. I thought they could of done a little bit better on that. I know it isn't easy to do it but in some films where they explode a helicopter and make it look really good. Car chase in it is really good and fast pace with lots of crashes which i like in a action movie. The acting in the film is really good too and it is directed very well. I probably would of given it a 10 if they had improved the special effects. Overall the film is brilliant. A very entertaining film and i'm pretty sure anyone will enjoy it.,Transporter 2

Unfortunately, my opinion sank even lower when a car flew into the air, rotated, and pinpointed a dangling crane hook to remove a bomb from the bottom of the vehicle just before it exploded.To enjoy this movie you MUST suspend all concepts of reality and plausibility. This was like watching the Road Runner and the Coyote going at it. The only thing missing was the big ACME logos. I can honestly say that I would have enjoyed Mel Blanc's work over this any day.If the world ever wakes up to smell the crap Hollywood is shoveling out, theaters, cable and satellite companies will need to find a new means to make money.If you crave good entertainment, stay away from this one and beware of any follow-ups.As for Jason Statham, I feel sorry for the guy because he has terrific potential at being a good action star. Unfortunately he continues to be casted in some real duds with poor screen-plays.My final note is this... This picture is only indicative of all films being released today. In each you will find a lot of special effects that while spectacular, are often too unbelievable without any story to support the efforts. It is truly my belief that Hollywood has upped the dosage and potency of their drugs. This is what you get when you have a lot of money to spend and no sense to direct the expenditures.",Transporter 2
143,computermech,Disappointing compared to Transporter 1,8,17 September 2005,I don't blame Jason Statham at all. He performed A1 as usual. It was not 'raw' like Transporter 1. Transporter 2 was too commercialised in the fear to win American audience but failed totally. It was pretty fake and the story was too Americanised. I would have preferred it to be Continental like the 1st version. Jason (Frank) gave his best but due to poor script and story he ended up looking like a 2nd rate actor. The action was good but the Martial Arts was lacking the originality of the 1st version. Loved the car though. Getting involved with a kid was pathetic and sloppy. I hope they come out with Transporter 3 with as original story and direction as Transporter 1. I would also like to see Jason as the new James Bond. Good luck to this new actor. Love his fighting style and mucsles.,Transporter 2

The acting wasn't incredible and the plot was a little familiar, but the action was so mind-blowing that it completely over took it. The critics may not like it because of it's lack of interesting story or imperfect acting. But seriously, the critics need to sit back, relax, and actually enjoy a movie for once. This movie is full of unbelievable stunts and is ridiculously entertaining. Jason Statham reprises his role from the original as the very cool Frank Martin.

Jason Statham once again shows us that he's a great ass kicker. The fight choreography is slightly better here than in the first movie. The actress who plays the little boy's mother was really good.

150,Elwood_Blues,Even the Taxi remake was better!,3,6 September 2005,"Just saw this movie and when I walked out one thought entered my mind immediately: What in God's name has happened to Luc Besson? The guy who made Nikita, Leon and the over the top but great Fifth Element wrote and produced one of the worst movies of the year (well, IMHO even his American Taxi remake was better than this and that's saying a lot!). Where to start?First the script... utterly disastrous (granted, it's not to be supposed realistic but this was so WAY over the top I was wondering if this was a Neal Moritz film. Even the first Transporter was a little more down to Earth). The story had so many holes even Swiss cheese makers would be jealous of! Example? Gianni injects himself with the antidote to hide/transport it... Hello??? Another one? How do we escape from a parking lot? Hmm, there was this James Bond movie... let's jump to the next building... yeah, right.Which leads me to the second point... the visual effects. Who did this? Some guy with his home PC? Man, this was done in such an incompetent way that the whole audience was laughing at it. The plane, the jump of the car, the exploding helicopter, the greenscreen shots, everything. This was not even TV standard... Not every film has a budget with millions of dollars for visual effects but there are other ways. There are so many talented people out there I can't believe this was the best they could find.Well, on the positive side you have Jason Statham, one of my favourite actors at the moment (Snatch and Mean Machine come to mind), who again delivers a fine performance as Frank Martin. Then there is Kate Nauta as the psychotic henchwoman. IMHO played in the right way creating a good antagonist for Frank. Again the script fails to deliver by disposing of her in a few seconds in a really stupid way. I had hoped for a really great fight here. Most of the other actors like Keith David, Matthew Modine and François Berléand are completely wasted.In the end this was a total waste of time of money and time due to a ridiculous script by a once great filmmaker and very bad visual effects.",Transporter 2

If you can overlook these two problems, the Transporter 2 is an excellent diversion.The movie opens with Frank Martin, inexplicably in Florida. He's filling in for a ""friend"" (again, not explained) and driving the son of a US Drug Policy agent to and from school. Of course, evil Columbian drug lords kidnap the kid and infect him with a Russian bioweapon virus, which he passes to his dad and the other high up drug enforcement guys. From here, the movie gets strange.This movie is chock full of awesome action sequences, most notably the scene were Frank applies a beatdown to several guys with a firehose, and the scene where he beats up a mountain of a man and drops a boat on him.It's not a thinking man's movie, nor did they claim it was.

Performances, such as they are are loose relaxed and don't drag the story down with unnecessary emoting, though what real acting there is here does work within the confines of the plot outline/story whatever. There are probably plot holes large enough to run 10 eighteen wheeler trucks through in here, but you're so involved in the action that it doesn't leave you time to think about logic inconsistencies, or logic in general really.

You lose!'I'll start by saying it's a good thing driver doesn't appear anywhere in the title, because driving is only a third of what Frank Martin does. He's a pilot who doesn't need an aeroplane. He's an acrobat in a graviton suit. He's a martial artist with an overactive imagination. He's even a driver in a vehicle without wheels. Starting to sound like an entertaining B Movie, right? Well, no. You won't find any 'I tried my best, but I guess I just suck' here. It's like someone hand picked the members of Team Fail. A Cinematographer trying to emulate Technicolour; a minimalist special effects troupe, led by an eccentric who never considered life outside his bouncy castle; a truant script girl; a plot jerked along by a piece of toilet paper, snared to King Kong's shoe; and an overactive product placement supervisor.So what is the story? A well-manicured, ugly South American is hired by some of his countrymen, who are outraged that the Law is eating into their profits. They hatch a brilliant plan involving a Soviet expatriate Biochemist, a green biological warfare agent, a purple antidote, a mercenary, a gun toting lingerie model and the ruling body of the Drug Enforcement Administration. So some bureaucrat gets his coffee poisoned? No. The public are poisoned and the DEA is held to ransom, while a mother-load of cocaine is pushed over the border? Nope. It's hard to tell if the plot is supposed to remain a mystery until half-way, or if it's just delivered poorly, so I'll reveal it carefully, without any pointers as to the obvious outcome. POSSIBLE SPOILER POSSIBLE SPOILER POSSIBLE SPOILER POSSIBLE SPOILERThe son of a DEA big shot is kidnapped against the best efforts of his school-run driver Mr. Martin, infected with a virus and then bizarrely returned without any of the millions of ransom money being taken. The kid infects his father, mother, driver and half the Miami police department with this highly contagious airborne pathogen. The ugly South American transfuses himself in about ten minutes with what appears to be the only half litre of antidote in existence and tries really hard not to go to the bathroom.Seems to me an extremely convoluted delivery method and a ridiculous insurance policy, but then I'm not a French screenwriter.I'd advise everyone to avoid this and watch the original instead.

168,jeremyglick,Insulting,3,8 September 2005,"I'm all for judging a movie based on the director's intent versus some high-minded ideal of what a film should be. For instance, I would give both Citizen Kane and Terminator 2 10 out of 10 stars because they both perfectly embodied the vision of the creator (character study vs. adrenaline rush). I would consider it elitist to think Welles's goal to be more worthy than Cameron's. So I approached Transporter 2 not only with that in mind but also having liked the first Transporter.But this one still bites.CONTAINS SPOILERS We know that character and plot development are not the priorities in an action film, but the audience needs something. The characters have to be at least mildly interesting and the plot borderline comprehensible, otherwise we get distracted and lose interest. Halfway through this movie I didn't care what happened anymore and was just holding out for a good action sequence.First, the characters. Our hero is a robot who literally dodges bullets, never changes expression, and can take any amount of punishment. Ho-hum. Our villain is a Columbian drug lord (what, the Nazis weren't available?) who is a pure sociopath with unlimited money and henchmen. Our hero's friend is second-banana comic-relief who helps our hero  and the plot  as needed. He's also not funny. None of them do anything unexpected, and none of them change. Heck, the tertiary characters are more fleshed out than these guys.Now the plot. As near as I can determine, the villain's plan is this: he'll help his drug trade by killing a bunch of drug enforcement officials (""czars"") at a big conference. Instead of a conventional bomb arrangement, he opts for a 100% lethal communicable disease that kills within 12 hours. So he kidnaps one czar's son THE MORNING OF THE CONFERENCE, infects the kid while holding him for ""ransom"", then returns him in time to infect the father before the father leaves his sick and traumatized son to head to the conference. Got all that? Oh, and the bad guy decides to test the deadly communicable disease on his own henchmen the morning of the kidnapping. And the kidnapping is planned the day before. I'm betting not unlike the script.The kicker is, the Columbian drug lord's plan WORKS. The czar does get infected, he does go to the conference and infect others, and the others do leave the conference not knowing they're infected. By the time our hero gets his hands on the antidote (which is enough for maybe 10 people), half the city could be infected. But that's probably just a minor loose end. Maybe Transporter 3 will be set in a post-apocalyptic hellscape.So is this sloppy writing, or just efficient? Other indicators say sloppy. Yes, there is a stereotypical scene near the end where the hero confronts the bad guy and the bad guy explains his entire plan to him. Yes, the villain could kill the hero but delegates the job to a henchman. Yes, the henchman could easily shoot our hero but literally walks within hand-fighting range and gets disarmed. And yes, the villain walks away assuming the hero got killed. So I say sloppy.But let's say you don't care about any of that, just the action. I'm afraid you'll get a mixed bag. There's the standard gun play, car chases, and twelve-against-one martial arts fighting, plus there is one excellent scene where our hero disables a bunch of bad guys with a fire hose. That's all well and fine, but where it really breaks down are the CGI scenes, which are fake enough to be insulting. One scene shows the transporter's car jumping from the middle of one parking garage across the street to another parking garage, and another is the final fight scene in an out-of-control Gulfstream jet. Both look like cartoons. The idea of a special effects shot is that you're not supposed to be able to tell it's a special effects shot, and these fail miserably. Even the non-CGI stunts are silly. At one point our hero spins his car 360° in the air (so that it is belly-up at one point) in order to dislodge a bomb from the bottom. Sounds cool to see, right? It's not. The audience laughed.The insults don't stop there. There's product placement. When the hero opens his fridge, there are 3 bottles of Heineken staring at us, all with the labels positioned perfectly for the camera. Within the first 60 seconds of the movie we have a 2-second ad for a watch and a 58-second ad for the car. In fact the whole movie serves as an Audi ad. The car does not receive one dent, ding, scratch, bullet hole, or broken taillight the entire film. Even James Bond loses a taillight now and then. If you're going to stretch the bounds of credulity to that extreme, at least make a joke about it. As it was, the audience was laughing unintentionally.If you're a fan of the first one, maybe rent this. 3/10",Transporter 2

Rather, we get a lot of the same from Frank and that is exactly what should be expected. I think in the modern era of the high concept action movies, they have forgotten how to just show the audience a good time. This movie and it's predecessor take us back to a time when action wasn't bogged down by complicated stories, rather the star's charisma and action were all that one needed to enjoy their time in the theater.These movies have no lofty aspirations other than to give you one hell of a ride for an hour and a half.

Unfortunately, the sequel is beyond insulting. When the entire audience starts laughing hysterically because of some offensively nonsensical moments that have to be seen to be believed, two things come to mind: One, this film is a steaming pile; two, was this steaming pile screen tested anywhere? Transporter 2 has little of the fight scene set pieces that made the original so neat. There's a set piece with a fire hose, but even that doesn't approach the fight in the first film where Statham is covered in oil and fighting a dozen goons with weighted shoes.And beyond some patently ridiculous vehicular acrobatic feats, there's also gaping holes of logic wide enough to drive an army through. Minor spoiler here: In two scenes, Statham is talking to a guy sitting at a computer that has access to a criminal database. Now, based on nothing more than a single photograph, the computer guy is able to sprinkle magic dust on his keyboard and pull up the guy's file in a matter of seconds. No name, no alias, no criminal history, place of birth -- anything. Just a photo. Although Transporter 2 gets points for not trying to ""enhance"" the photo, they get docked heavily for turning a criminal database into The All-Powerful Jesus of Fight 'Em Justice.Moving right along.

It didn't help that the THX theater speakers were cranked up to 12, but the punishingly overbearing music never leaves an iota of space for things like, oh, subtlety or tension. Sometimes a scene is much more powerful without music. I think Transporter 2 could have held up on its own as trashy summer action, but with the clobbering Fight Music, Tension Music, and Celebration Music, this film ends up bludgeoning itself and the audience into numbness.You have to do more than just turn your brain off for something as bad as this. You have to not respect yourself as a moviegoer, because it sure doesn't feel like these people respect us. The jarring juxtaposition of brutal violence and PG-13 titillation; of the hero's noble intentions without any motivation; and of talented actors trapped or letting themselves be trapped in this incredible disaster is almost beyond comprehension, until you factor in the cynical condescension that permeates mainstream Hollywood.I'd give it a zero if I could.",Transporter 2
171,SpiderbiteStudios,"When Directors change, so do the standards",5,11 September 2005,"Now I will be the first one to admit that 'Transporter 2' was an exciting movie, with lots of action and a great lead actor (Jason Statham). But what I will not do is lie to you about what a different Director can do to the overall feel of a sequel.This movie was a little over the top, even for an action flick. Many times when different Directors take over a sequel, they lose that little something that made the first one so good. In this case it is some basics of reality and gravity, not to mention the way 'Frank Martin' even acts toward his enemies. In the first movie, he was just a guy that could kick butt, but when the guns started blazin' he would get the hell out of the way just like everyone else. In this movie the director has him walking toward some people firing a gun at him, like he is the T1000 from T2 ... I mean what the hell?!?! When fight scenes in the first movie took place, he used what he had on hand to fight the bad guys. An excellent example of this was the shipping container doors ... just some really good use of space. In this movie, they tried to do the same thing (since I guess they know that is what made the first one fun also) only they do it in such a way that just takes you out of the reality of the moment, and it is very distracting. The only fight sequence in the sequel that comes close to keeping reality a factor (if only for movie reality) was the 'firehose fight'. But the jumping from the car to the landing gear, I just could not believe that they even did that.And one other thing ... I like a girl in her underware firing a gun as much as the next guy, but to put it in a movie like the Transporter 2 was almost like saying ""look, I know this movie isn't going to be as good as the first one, so let's stick a half-naked chick in there to get the kids to come see it."" The bringing back of Tarconi for comic relief was kind of nice, but again ... it kind of felt like they really had pulled away from so many things that made the first one enjoyable. And I just hate it when a director does that, even if he DID work on the first one with the first Director.All in all I am glad that I saw this movie, because of Jason Statham, and because it is a sequel, and I am a movie junkie. But to try to put it along the same lines of quality as the first one ... it's just not going to happen.5 out of 10 stars",Transporter 2

The charm, cohesion, and surprises of the first movie are lacking here. The plot is ridiculous and the villains predictable and boring. Most annoying is the techno-redundant soundtrack of this sequel that is painful to hear and a far, far cry from the original's pulsating score.

174,grimrogue,What movie were you people watching?!?,2,11 September 2005,"I think Jason Statham is a cool actor, and the character of Frank Martin as a professional ""transporter"" for hire is somewhat original and has tons of potential for a great action movie. It's just too bad that this film hasn't been made yet. I wasn't much of a fan of the first Transporter flick, but I was impressed enough with the basic idea of it, along with Statham's slick performance, to be interested in seeing a sequel some day when it inevitably came out. Well that day did come, and it was a very disappointing one indeed.To put it simply, the first Transporter movie had about two memorable action sequences. Transporter 2 has one. That basic math alone makes the original superior. There are not a lot of fight scenes in this movie, and what martial arts we do get to witness are displayed with too many quick cuts and confusing edits. This disorienting and choppy style also flattens the intensity of the car chases, making one extended driving scene in particular frustrating to watch. For a film about a professional driver, the action on the road should be much better than this.I can handle all of the over the top action sequences (I was greatly looking forward to them), and the sometimes cheesy dialogue and poor special effects, but what I can't handle in a movie like this is a bland directing style and a silly plot that was not very captivating at all. The two main villains are somewhat sinister but are not very unique, nor are they used to their full effect, and the cookie-cutter henchmen are all quite ridiculous.I just wanted to have fun with this movie. I wanted to be taken on a wild, unbelievable ride with Frank Martin as he saves the day while struggling triumphantly to get his ""cargo"" to the destination on time. Great car chases? None. Great fight scenes? There was one. Great directing style? There's only one really awesome shot that comes to mind. Great story? Negative.Still I am a fan of the character, and when Transporter 3 eventually rolls around I'm sure that I will see the preview for it and sincerely say, ""Frank Martin is back. Cool.""",Transporter 2

I think it was by far the best raw action movie, with all the familiar adrenaline boosters pushed to the limits. As a result, I was more than a little pumped for the sequel, so I rushed out immediately to the theatre to see it. I was pretty disappointed. I'm usually a pretty attentive viewer, but it took me the second viewing to figure out what the virus thing was actually trying to accomplish. I thought the first 2 acts of the movie were great otherwise. The action was just as good as the first, and the subplot with the inspector was a much needed relief from the lack of plot otherwise. I take issue with other writer's claims that all the action is unrealistic. Specifically, the car jump scene is beyond implausible, but thats OK, it could have just as easily not been there but then we'd be one explosion shy. Otherwise everything looked pretty authentic. I buy that Frank needs to drop more than a few bows to take out a 300 pound gorilla, or that he can beat a bunch of guys with a hose. In real life it probably just wouldn't work, but it could, so I'll take it. The ending is really the only terrible thing. They build up both the baddies to be the fight of the century and the girl gets one shotted and he fights the Latin lover in the cabin of a plane with no room to move. That was the most disappointing thing to me. If they threw a few roundhouse kicks Chuck Norris style or brought the dead back to life with the sheer force of their blows, then I'd probably soil myself, get back in line and watch it again. Oh well, here's hoping they put together a budget and a script for #3.",Transporter 2
179,ZOMBIE-8,More enjoyable if you think it was based on a Marvel Comic,6,31 January 2006,"Now, I kinda enjoyed the first one, but it felt like it was missing something. Like it was taking itself too seriously or something. This one... well, you can't take seriously, but it's more fun in that all logic is thrown out the window. It's not like the acting is bad or anything (not even newcomer Kate Nauta's acting was that bad), it's just that as the film progresses, it gets more and more unrealistic. Once Frank is able to disarm a bomb under his car a certain way (won't give it away, but those who've seen this know this is the most infamous scene of the film), you should realize that anything can happen now... and it does. However, with this, the action is far more impressive, and has almost a seventies martial arts movie feeling. Basically, imagine crossing James Bond with Sonny Chiba and you'll get an idea of what this is like. Aside from that little example, it's like the first film was tired, sucked down as much coffee and caffeine as it could find, and then the sequel was born. The plot is far more complex than the first, but it's one of those plots set up for the sake of action. Like the first film, however, the last fight left much more to be desired, but it was still better than the first. Anyway, for action fans, this is definitely worth at least a rental.",Transporter 2
180,BeauEvil,"Is ""Transporter 2"" a satire of other action flicks?",3,4 April 2009,"I picked up the DVD for $5, expecting to easily get my money's worth. Oh, well. Sometimes, you win. Sometimes, you lose.Well, sometimes, MOST of us lose. But not Frank Martin. He seems to have been infected with the Red Dwarf Luck Virus instead of this story's engineered virus. He DID manage to get a boo-boo on his forehead. Not bad for taking on many bad guys, empty handed, several times. He also dares a number of different people to just shoot him. He manages to make a ""stock"" car do such ridiculous stuff that it shames the General Lee and Kit. It HAS to be tongue-in-cheek, doesn't it?! The gun play alone are the best examples of never-ending ammunition I've witnessed in decades. I counted about 17 shouts by the ""Russian"" dude before he (cliché warning) THREW his pistol at Frank. I tried to count the ridiculous number of rounds fired by the ugly chick from twin machine pistols with 30-shot clips.I still haven't figured out how she dumped both (empty) clips, wheeled around, and sprayed the cops. Evidentally, she was supposed to have slapped in two fresh clips, without taking her hands off the pistol grips, while in mid-turn, having previously counted well enough to leave a live round in each weapon. Apparently, they couldn't get the idea to work for film and just went with imagination.Just forget about the film and just use your imagination; like when the boy was infected by an injection that he never received, or a news helicopter fails to follow a car that just blew past a whole police force, or that lying down in a car protects you from machine gun fire (unlike Bonnie and Clyde), or that, instead of ramming the steering gear of a jet on takeoff, the better idea is to stand up, at well over 100mph, without a driver, and jump onto the steering gear yourself.Columbians couldn't find anyone to inject a kid for less than many millions of dollars?! When a Lear Jet crashes into the ocean, a passenger can leap toward the BACK of the plane?! And so on, and on, and on. Come on folks.

Instead of the BWM 7-series, we are showcasing Audi's A8 W12 in black colour that never looses it's luster. Nope, after driving on the sand, through a wet parking lot, through a building under construction, it still holds it's shine. Perhaps they should have placed a ""product placement"" for Turtle Wax? Don't get me wrong, I think the Audi A8 is the best looking full-size luxury car, but seriously, we were also shown the A3 along with Audi's sister division, Lamborghini, showing the spectacular Murciélago Roadster.The only positive part about the movie, I will admit, is the choice of colours used in the film.

This is the kind of movie where your jaw will be hanging open for most of its brisk 80 minutes. Absolutely nothing in this film is even remotely possible. I know, I know the aim for this movie was not to be possible in any way whatsoever. Its goal is to entertain the audience and at that it succeeds. But even action movies have to show just a little restraint in how over the top they go, right? The stunts involve a speedboat leap off a conveniently placed ramp onto a highway so Frank Martin(Jason Statham)can leap onto a bus and catch one of the terrorists whom he has been chasing. The terrorist is Russian of course and is named Dimitri. Why does almost every action movie have a Russsian bad guy?Another stupid stunt comes at the end of a car chase between Frank, The terrorist leaders wife: Lola(Kate Nauta, who gives an effective performance) and the Miami police force. The chase was fun until the very end, when Frank drives all the way up a parking garage and(wait for it) crashes through the wall and flys through the air for about a hundred feet before landing on the building across the street (which is luckily under construction, so there is nobody inside) and then skidding for the length of the building until they come to a stop directly on the edge of the building.You may ask how they would manage to drive the car off the building. Well guess what? Somehow, in methods the movie doesen't make quite clear, Frank manages to get each side of the car onto each side of a building and drive over an alley. A drunk guy looks up and sees the car pass over him. He then looks at his beer and grimaces, thinking he is hallucinating. I thought I was hallucinating too. That had to be one of the strangest stunts I've ever seen. I guarantee you the makers of this film were probably a little more than a bit tipsy when they dreamed this stunt up. Look, I could go on and on explaining the implausibilities. Some of it is even too stupid for Bond, and thats saying something(The CGI is also pretty bad in this movie, which dosen't help it's cause.)Although on the plus side the acting isn't too bad and the film has a fast, exhilarating pace. Compared to the original though, this is yet another sequel that tried to do too much and just got too stupid. The original had its share of action but it didn't get too out of control.I don't mind a good dumb action movie with impossible stunts. But when I see something as out of control as Transporter 2, I hang my mouth open in disbelief. Seriously what were these filmmakers thinking??? Do they really think that audiences are that stupid?

195,donatolla,It could have been much better...,4,4 September 2005,"I have to admit to having high hopes for this movie. I'm a fan of the first one, and generally like the genre (if car chase intensive, intelligence, thriller crime movie is a genre). The trailer let me down a bit, but thought it was still worth seeing.I probably should have waited for the rental. I expected a tiny plot, with car chases, hand-to-hand combat and action. Instead, the plot was non-existent, the action was hokey and special effects were unbelievable and of poor quality.OK, so there was no reason to expect any plot. There were subtleties in the film that linked it to the first one (The French inspector being one). I liked that. The cast was pretty good, with an exception - Matthew Modine was horrible.What really irked me was the absurd degree to which this movie went completely cartoony. Action sequences that involved hand-to-hand combat were enjoyable and clearly well put together. Unfortunately, it was very clear a number of times that movie props were being used. Maybe we are spoiled these days with CGI effects, but I expect better than the many green screen effects in this movie. Believability went straight out the window on this one. The Audi in the film goes through extreme punishment without suffering damage. Planes crash at full speed into water and only break into 3 pieces. Sea-Doo's are able to jump onto land and continue to travel highway speed. Surface tension and friction be damned! This isn't what I really dislike about this film though. I dislike that it completely betrays the first movie. The first movie was almost believable. The car scenes had a visceral feel to them. The hand to hand combat was cool. Why they choose to create an over the top cartoony version of a Jackie Chan movie I'll never know. This movie could have stayed realistic and remained as enjoyable as the first one.I don't always believe in the sequel jinx, but in this case I think the filmmakers got greedy. If you want to watch the movie this should have been, put on the Bourne Identity/Supremacy or Ronin. If you want to watch a cartoony action flick, watch Kung Fu Hustle. This movie isn't a complete disappointment; it was certainly a fun movie....But it could have been sooo much better.",Transporter 2
196,Arctic_fox,This film is worse than absolute garbage,3,20 May 2006,"I thought that Transporter 1 was the worst film and had the most unbelievable plot I have ever seen. I was wrong: Transporter 2 is even worse! It seems that directors and screenwriters do not give any credit to the IMDb, since they clearly have not read at all what users have written about the first film. People that had comments about the first film had lucidly told what was wrong with the first film. Here are some of my comments from the first film: ""Irrational action from the start. The plot was really illogical. What's the fun of watching a film where you think that the good guy must be a god, because he can perform actions what humans are not possibly able to do. Therefore, you (the viewer) think that there is absolutely nothing that can happen to the hero and there is no point watching the film, since you already know what's going to happen. Such stunts are logical when a robot from the future or someone in the matrix does them but humans aren't supposed to be able to do such actions. I think though that the actor, Jason Statham has talents and I hope he will be seen in more classy films in the future."" Well the second film had absolutely the same faults that the first film had. Luc Besson clearly has not been reading IMDb. Since the second film (if possible) was even worse garbage than the first one. We have seen Jason Statham in at least one classy film after the Transporter in ""The Italian Job"". But why on earth did Jason become involved with the same stupid project Transporter once again. Hasn't even he learned anything?",Transporter 2
197,oenmet_een_k,Just plain sucks,6,15 October 2005,"I went to this movie with a fresh mind. I find Jason Statham an excellent actor (just watch 'Lock, Stock and two smoking Barrels' and 'Snatch'), so I hoped for at least a watchable film. But boy, does this one stink. I don't know about the first 'Transporter', but this one has such a twisted series of events, that the script must have been missing while they were filming. The action scenes are really over the top. Still,these sorts of films can be fun to watch. This one isn't, the setting is awful, and something fundamental for a film is missing (aka a descent storyline). And to top it off, the 'evil lovers', in the beginning presented as capable of delivering a good fight, are dealt with in seconds, leaving you (well, me at least) really disappointed. This is really a wast of anyone's time, even if you like B-movie style action films. I really hope to see this 'Statham' in a decent movie though.",Transporter 2
198,ylikone,Unintentional comedy?,3,2 September 2005,"The crowd in the theater where I saw this was mostly laughing at all the ridiculous and completely unbelievable stunts. Honestly, there are many parts in the movie where gravity and laws of physics are completely ignored. I love the scenes where the plane is going all crazy in the sky, whipping about in every direction, but yet the two main characters continue to duke it out in the aisle. You'd think in real life they would pretty much be pinned to the walls. Oh, and then the plane crashes into the ocean... but guess what, they survive with no injuries, just a bit wet. Also, watch for any dents or scratches on the Audi... because you won't see any even after he drives through barricades and concrete walls! The entire premise of the movie is one big logic flaw... they are trying to eliminate a political figure and use a deadly virus to infect him via his son. Yet, they go around killing anyone that gets in there way, cops, doctors and other innocent people. WHY OH WHY did they not just take out the politician directly!? This movie is just so flawed on so many levels! If all you want from a movie is a brainless action flick, with the calm coolness of someone like Bruce Willis mixed with the crazy fight sequences of someone like Jackie Chan, then you will like this movie... otherwise, forget about it.

Instead it has opted for a lot of cartoon style martial arts moves that are so improbable and unlikely that you need to switch off all your higher brain functions just to accept.Audi must be pleased though - their cars are portrayed as being able to smash through most materials without even scratching the paint.I walked out of the film after 35 minutes..avoid - like the plague.",Transporter 2
200,dagen-2,"I expected more out of a ""Transporter"" sequel",5,9 March 2006,"Lets start of with saying I loved the first transporter movie. It was interesting, kept me watching, had some variation in it, .. It was a great movie!And of course I expected nothing less of the sequel. It was easy, all they had to do was stick to their formula. I can only guess that someone important to the first script killed himself, thus leaving his legacy to be screwed over by some ignorant *generic insult here* responsible for writing every Hollywood action movie. (pardon my choice of words.)Transporter 2 starts with one assignment and that one assignment is what the rest of the movie is about. Like any action hero, he becomes the underdog, tracks down his enemy and succeeds wonderfully in his attempts. Lots of car stunts (some slightly over the top.. The one with the crane really lacks credibility) and lots of fighting. The later made me realize that these days, dance oriented movies still exist. A new and updated version that is! The dances are made to appear like ""Fights to the Death"" but in the end, its still a dance. And usually I can live with that.. But this was again just ever so slightly over the top. The whole fire hose scene for example! A sequel wouldn't be a sequel if it didn't involve parts of the first movie. And this is a sequel! He drives .. cars .. and its the same person driving .. ... OK, this might appear a bit thin to really call it a sequel! ... So they poured in another character (more of a caricature to be honest) from the first movie & there we go :) We have a sequel. And this time.. he s in Miami!! Exciting isn't it! well, no! Its where any action movie happens these days! I was happy at the time of Transporter (one) to see an action movie set in France, inundated in French culture, that was new. But thats one of the aspects they decided to change in the sequel. Why move to Miami? It seems quite simple to me.. I'd guess to appeal to the general American public. I hope it worked! I was disappointed anyway. The story lacked the twists the first one had and the whole plot engine .. was OK, but not genius, or fresh for that matter.In the end, I'm not saying that ""The Transporter 2"" is a bad movie.. Its just that I had expected A Lot more. Maybe its right to say they just ""sold out""!",Transporter 2

This one probably deserves a 5 out of 10, but I'm grading it a 6 for the film's energy, upbeat music, and for Jason Statham performing admirably with a less than stellar script.In general, there are some scenes that are just completely unrealistic, and I mean beyond the normal suspension of belief one normally checks at the door when seeing a movie.There is much less martial arts in this sequel, and the fight scenes are no way near the quality and cool feel of the original movie.And of course, just my opinion, but the first half of the movie seemed more crisp and the plot was okay, but the second part the plot just doesn't work as well, and it seems rushed and unsatisfying.I'd have a hard time looking forward to a third installment of the Transporter unless perhaps Corey Yuen, the original director returns.",Transporter 2

203,chatpilot,Dim witted and action packed,4,6 September 2005,"I must admit that I am a fan of the original Transporter.When I found out that there was going to be a sequel to it I put it on my must view list.Unfortunately after going to the opening I must say that I was very disappointed with it.My main problem with it was some of the action sequences.There was one scene in particular that caught my eye.Our hero Jason Statham runs toward a moving truck.Lunges on to the hood and climbs up the windshield and up onto an overpass.Besides the impossibility of anyone ever pulling off such a stunt,It felt as if you could almost see the wire pulling him up.Although it was not visible the way he flew up that truck well you can almost imagine seeing the wire.Also I was disappointed with the last fight scene.The villain is shown in one scene of the movie kicking several guys asses with his kendo stick.But when he fights Statham it's done on an out of control airplane which took away from the climatic fight scene in my opinion.If you go in expecting a blockbuster you might be disappointed as I was.But if you don't mind some of the absurdities then you might enjoy it.",Transporter 2

Much better screen play then the first part but a bit diverted, how? i will discuss as i go further. This movie is a tribute to Michael Stone (director of photography for this flick) , who died in an accident. We will surely miss him & remember him with his implacable Cinematography in flicks like Pearl Harbor & Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines.Movie starts as Frank has relocated to Miami, Florida where as a favor to a friend, Frank is driving for the wealthy Billings family . He unexpectedly bonded with junior Jack Billings age 6, who he drives to school. But when Jack is kidnapped, Frank must use his battle- tested combat skills to retrieve the boy. At first it looks like a kidnapping for ransom but it turns out much bigger conspiracy.With better screenplay & much better villain(Alessandro Gassman) who fights till the end, which is so real to watch. Jason Statham shows his skills in performing stunts. That fighting sequence with water melons as boxing gloves was so creative & hilarious at the same time & the sprint on the roof was amazing.The leading lady Amber Valletta as Audrey Billings was much more powerful in her performance then Qi Shu in the first part.Many negative aspects again haunt this sequel. To start with main theme, all that illegal transportation ,with those rules in the first part gone .Fighting sequence with Lola(Kate Nauta) should have been more thrilling, it was very short.The stunt where frank removes the bomb plotted under his car by flying through the ship anchor was so unrealistic. Matthew Modine (Jefferson Billings)performing so weak in this flick with much better screenplay,this flick again lands 6/10 in my list with so many loopholes , i recommend it only for entertainment.If u want to watch some thing which is more meaningful better watch something else.",Transporter 2
205,Elrin,Watchable...but seriously delusional.,5,3 April 2011,"It is mindless entertainment...if you like that kind of thing. And it IS vaguely entertaining. But stupid. Incredibly stupid.And these are the reasons why:1) The editors thought that by turning up the exposure and contrast really high the movie would have that 007 glamour feel to it.Wrong, it really is overdone. Resulting in the female villain being an eyesore and the need to wear sunglasses compulsory.2) Physics does not apply to ANY of the stunts! The driving is cool...and Stratham's fighting ability impressive...but it has a 'Crouching tiger hidden dragon' feel to it (invisible rocket boots?!) and tbh doesn't pull it off well. And the female villain is...some say lingerie, guns and loads of dirty eyeliner is hot (and in theory, is) but frankly I was more disgusted.3) Script is one big sickening cliché. ""Frank Martin: I'm afraid that your flight's been cancelled. Gianni: I'm afraid that *you* have been cancelled! """"Would you rather be late...or dead?""...and ""Have a good life. What's left of it. ""Truly appalling.On the other hand, I like the relationship between Stratham and the young boy at the beginning - endearing in a humorous way (the riddle game) and I think there are some decent actors in it.The plot was decent in theory, I think it was just its execution which stank. But I couldn't tell whether it was intended to be taken seriously or whether the director knew it was one big joke?What really kept the movie afloat for me though was the French Policeman (Stratham's friend).

Don't wanna spoil it so i wont say what it is. The music is the same, some of the tunes are from The Transporter. The camera work needs improvement, there was too many damn close ups of the car, and it way too fast. You couldn't actually see what's going on. Sound was a little loud. It's funny that a guy can get hurt so many times, very hard in fact, yet he's only got 1 stitch n a few scratches on his face. And another little goof, Frank's car has no dents in it whatsoever. Camera angles needs to be above view as well, like from a helicopter, not close ups of the side and front and back of the car. The stunts did most of the work, stunts were better in this film.

There are certain scenes from this movie that have to be seen to be believed, which are so outrageous that you can't take the film seriously.Then again, that's the whole point of Transporter 2.This movie is entertaining, action packed and incredibly well choreographed, and this film proves, that along with Taken and District 13, that French people know how to create effective and engaging action sequences. While I do think it is entertaining, I personally can only watch this film once.When I try to watch this film again, I already know what's going to happen, and it ruins the entertainment value of this film. This is the same case for Taken, while Taken was such a great film the first time I saw it, when I saw it again I didn't really care about what happened in the film, so I can't watch it anymore.Transporter 2 is a 5/10 for me, it's average yet enjoyable.Transporter 2 knows it's audience, it knows who it's trying to appeal to and it successfully satisfies that audience for it's short running time of 87 minutes.Watch this film with some buddies and enjoy watching Jason Statham driving and beating people up, and you can also enjoy Kate Nauta being half naked through most of the film.Kate Nauta is half naked through most of the film, and carries two sub-machine guns and kills people.

Director Louis Leterrier(Who directed The Incredible Hulk) takes on the Transporter. He makes it exciting. Lots of over the top action. Fight scenes are fantastically choreographed(Cory Yuen). Car chases are beautiful. Kate Nauta is sexy. She is sexy as a nurse, sexy in pink, sexy in red, sexy in almost nothing, sexy with guns. She even has a song on the soundtrack. Amber Valletta is gorgeous! The perfect Bond women! The cars are supercharged. The villian is crazy, hellbent on destruction. The score by Alexandre Azaria is superb! Reminds me at moments of John Barry's music in Bond films. The songs on the soundtrack explode with techno beats that make you want to buy it. The 5.1 surround adds a big plus as well.

215,petr-17,"Not Eurotrash, just Americrap",2,3 September 2005,"The first Transporter was enjoyable Euro action fun, even though it was directed by Hong Kong Chinese Corey Yuen. It was a silly frolic in the European countryside with obvious homo-erotic overtones. It was Eurotrash to the core.Alas, Transporter 2 suffers from being Americanized and butchered by novice director Louis Leterrier, who simply brings shame to his country of birth, France. His direction, or rather lack there of, emphasizes the cookie cut stereotypes and empowers a deep sexist and racist style.Jason Statham is fantastic as the film burns to the ground around him, with a perpetual look of horror at the film's ashes. Kate Nauta, his woefully underused adversary, is exploited to the hilt by labeling her insane (she even says so) and wearing underwear throughout the film. She could have carried such great poise with a different wardrobe and smarter direction.Only the sequences with François Berléand provide any aesthetic to the film. But they are short, limited and obviously added on after the film to provide it with some sort of saving grace (but alas the ship sunk before his involvement.) The rest of the actors are purely dough to their American character cookie cutters. All must be ashamed and hopefully will try very hard to do a European or art-house film to bring credibility to their now very tarnished names.Story is nothing special, if a little stupid, and contains many chases. A typical dumb action formula that relies on being distinguished by direction (not in this case though.)Cinematogrpahy stinks so badly,that your eyes gag, burn and dry heave at every single frame of the film. Almost every single frame contains bloomed highlights and has a orange tone that is reminiscent of a very cheap digital video camera. A lot of the shots are slightly out of focus (just look at the title sequences and you'll see that it is not the fault of the projectionist at all as the titles are crisp against off focus footage.) The special effects team, including novices like Mike Doyle, are blatant amateurs who have no business to be in film at all. The jet CG sequences are atrocious, and bring dishonor to world of computer animation.Music is OK, and a good reuse from Sin City's instrumental rendition of Cells by The Servant is nicely integrated to save some weak footage.Ultimately a film to avoid at all costs.

And thats just what this film turned out to be.Now, i'm all for a good action film, but this was a little TO Hollywood for my book. I went in expecting a somewhat good time, and came out having one more or less. Let me explain.If your wanted to see this for plot, and as a realistic high standard action film, your going to be VERY disappointed. The stunts though really cool looking, are virtually impossible to pull off -- realistically. The transporter was almost superman-like in a film that was based on a realistic present day world, and he pulled off things that SHOULD NOT and COULD NOT have happened. This is the negative side to the film, and really the plot was Mediocre at best.** PLOT Spoiler** The whole virus idea is so overused at this point in time, and since they didn't expand on it enough until the end it didn't really matter. The ending however well, it looked rushed. Althougth, it became more and more like a James Bond film then a driving film with each scene.Now , the positives: If you wanted to see a action film that would mildly entertain you on a Friday night, this is a great little flick. Sure it's not the best, and sure it's not the most realistic, but it was fun overall. Now I know there are a lot of people who won't see a movie just because the plot is really unrealistic -- But if your like me, it dosn't take much to be entertained. Just to be simply entertained, this was a good film. You get to see some cool action scenes, and while they are Hollywood style, and almost superhuman at points, they are still very much so enjoyable. The plot can keep you somewhat entertained, as well as the characters, however they arn't the best. The action is the glue in this case.Overall - It's an average film. I'd say 5-6 out of 10. If you want to see an action movie with decent fighting and stunts, or have nothing better to do on a Friday night, give it a look.If your looking for a film to keep you entertained and enrich you in a realistic plot with realistic events, pass this one.",Transporter 2
218,hob63,Let down after the first movie,1,8 September 2005,"The first transporter I though on the whole was a tidy film, fast and the furious meets James Bond, but with a plot. The second film is not so, based loosely on ""the transporter"" theme, the first sign of a slipping plot is when the hero turns up in his car. The original transporter had I believe a sleek black m5 bmw, a very respectable car with performance to match. The sequel see's our hero turn up in a black audi, automatic. Not really classed as a drivers car, he may as well had parking sensors. The loose plot is predictable and is based around mission impossible 2. The effects unlike the original are mostly cgi'd and are poorly done at that, not that the effects don't look real but are impossible, for example, how would you get the bomb off the bottom of your car? How about flipping the car mid air, getting the hook of a crane to scrape the underside, removing the bomb, before rotating back for a nice safe landing? Or how about jumping through a re-enforced barrier at the top of a building, continuing to jump to the next ""car park"" landing on another level (lower) only about 1cm from the edge almost falling off. Close to the ending is the funniest example, you have to see it to believe what a plane can do, and the plane crashes into the water, tail broken off, but yet there manages to be a nice air pocket for our actor and evil enemy to have another fight, despite a huge hole, where the end of the plane was. In summary it truly defines moder hollywoods inability to make films and also continues the trend that sequels must be bigger louder etc etc (and also worse than the original).

Oh, and why would such a super human person with magical driving skills, such skills that they can make the car leap and do a 360 midair and rip off a bomb underneath, just sit there when the laser is on the boy?

As far as being something that is brand new it didn't - which a sequel will never do. However, in terms of topping the stunts and action, I'd say it beat the original by a long shot. Having a different story line made a big difference, as well.Other than one small point about one particular stunt was officially more overblown than others, this movie packs the punch it promises. If you're seeking a classic action movie with a great lead character who has attitude, an eccentric nemesis, and even a small love interest - than one absolutely could not go wrong with this sequel to what has become a classic already in the original Transporter.

All the old explosion and car chase standbys are present and accounted for, but rising action star Jason Statham takes care to make sure every action sequence is more unforgettable than the last. Needless to say, he succeeds. I have to say this, also: Lola, the film's hitwoman, gets better treatment than a lot of female villains, neither getting kiddie glove treatment or being a misogynist plaything (uh, Cube and Jackson, I'm talking to you).

Aside from hitting a ramp, doing a three sixty into the air and timing his rotation to clip an explosive device from the underside of his car (the point at the movie when I apologized to my friend next to me, who i had brought with the promise of a good action flick).This guy had way too much fun in the editing room, instead of just making an alarm go off in the hospital, he has the camera wiggle and undulate with wave computer generated effects, and show the characters face of surprise as the sound and camera approached them. For a split second I was left to wonder if some freak amoeba weapon had been released in the hospital.He couldn't even let the laser sites on the machine gun pass over the camera without making a fancy ""laser noise""! Leave us not forget the gratuitous ""establish Frank as a bad ass"" footage, like him walking towards the fleeing Russian scientist (played by an actor who could not be ANYTHING but Englsih/Scottish/Irish) as he shoots at him, Frank makes no attempts to disarm him, just marches with his angry face, ridiculous, then the nice slow standing up after he hops over the wall, to slowly adjust his coat with his angry face.His music video-ish character portrayal, and excessive fun with sound effects aside, there's the issue of prostitution: James Bond always had the Bond car, BMW was getting some advertisement, we always accepted that, but this was ridiculous, at one point, when in his fancy sports car ( not the Audi, the on at then end) rather than going straight he peforms a 360 degree turn, then goes straight. Just to promenade and show this thing off.Then the lame fight scene with the blonde girl swinging from beads, attacking by sticking her feet out as she went by. If you've studied the martial arts you know that an airborne kick is not a matter of running, jumping (swinging in this case) then sticking your legs out....there's a kick aspect! this scene was pathetic.Throw in some very odd African American characters (played by some very odd looking fellows), and a couple of Russian scientists who like to package biological agents in an assortment of beautiful glass containers, and you've got yourself a movie that destroys what could have been a great franchise.",Transporter 2

The storyline takes a BIG backseat this time around, I know it's supposed to be a fun action packed film but PLEASE! The french detective who's name escapes me now had a good part in the first film, with the ""I know you're up to something but one day I may catch you out"" feel to him. This time around, well he may as have been a different character all together. Sleeping on a bench in the Miami Police Station after showing them all how to cook and then sloping off to somebody's desk to use their PC? The Jamaican Taxi driver, where did he come from? A chance meeting in an alley and then he's helping the hero out - for what reason? The fight sequences are good but too many, I could go on but, I was just SO disappointed with this film. I'm amazed that this get's so many good reviews and at the time of writing this it has a higher score than The Transporter (first one).

If only they'd have let him carry the film instead of all the silly special effects. I like to have some degree of realism in a movie, even if it is small. They just went too far and made too much of the stunts plain silly. I mean, come on, how can a car collide with so many things, and still not have a scratch or a dent? I want you to go see the movie, but Statham is so good in this role, that all they did was detract from the movie by going overboard. I would like to see a Transporter 3, but I think they need to be a little more serious and make it a little more realistic. I liked the main villain, but they really lost the opportunity for him to have a good confrontation with Statham. The one they did was lame.

Where the easiest and most logical way to remove a remote-controlled bomb from the bottom of your car is to drive it off a ramp, flip it upside down, and scrape it off onto a conveniently placed crane hook? Where the plot is so full of holes that it makes Pauly Shore movies seem to be Merchant and Ivory epics in comparison? This is not a movie which invites critical thought; it's a video game in live action form (Uwe Boll, take note: this is how you COULD do it). It consciously echoes the spectacular but utterly goofy action flicks of the eighties and nineties. It's a series of explosions, vehicle chases and martial arts whup-fests, all tossed together with some sweetly witty dialogue and gorgeous scenery (both human and real estate).Transporter 2 is the movie equivalent of a particularly stupid Labrador retriever puppy -- too dumb to honestly respect, but so darn cute you have to love it.

I do agree with the common comments about this movies unrealistic moments. There are at least 5 extremely ridiculous scenes, however, I don't necessarily find any of them to be involved with the hand-to-hand combat. I only believe that the vehicle scenes were pathetic. What from jumping a car off a huge building, and somehow landing it on a floor of a building under construction; to a machine gun blowing a helicopter up in about 3 bullets. Oh, and let's not forget the notorious super jet. Somehow reaching impressive heights in a matter of moments, then spinning completely out of control, but somehow regains control several times, only to radically lose it again. However, the actual fight scenes I found quite satisfying. They seemed nothing more far-fetched than any of Jet Li's movies (coming to mind Jet Li taking on roughly 30 black belts with weapons, in the end police station scene of Kiss of the Dragon). I did notice that during one or two scenes, they tended to do the boring one-enemy-at-a-time routine. I hate that, you have the hero hitting one guy while the others wait their turn. Other than that, the other scenes seemed to be adequately entertaining. Not to mention, the music in this movie seemed to flow quite well. I do find that the main plot was exceptionally decent, but they did seem to trail from it at times. At least it seemed more in depth than the first one. Now don't get me wrong, I like The Transporter a lot, but the whole plot behind it was kind of simple. One more thing, Jason Stathom is turning out in more and more movies, and I feel that he deserves it. I like him as an actor, and find him to be very believable. Not to mention, I enjoy him doing most of his own stunts. Always makes you respect an actor in action films more.

Even the cool blooded iron face of Frank Martin was justifyable due to his background and inventiveness later on, while at the same time offset by that same face tensing up as the challenge increases.However, Transporter 2 was none of the above.Mistakes can be tolerable, plots don't have to be perfect, and not everything has to be correct physics, but it is clear that Transporter 2 has been completely Hollywoodized. Cheap thrills with unbelievable and incredible action in the true and bad sense of the word: It is in no way credible and therefor can only be entertaining when shutting off the brain or simply lacking one.

I generally like Luc Besson, and I liked the first Transporter, so I don't understand how this movie got to be so stupid. The writers and producers of this and similar films would be advised to note that the best action films have suspenseful plots that at least pretend to be based in reality.

The first one may have been a more believable (or on second thought, just less ridiculous) storyline, but i found myself just not interested at all. The special effects were horrible, and the acting and attempts at humor were awful. But in transporter 2 they take on a new, stylish, up and coming french director, Louis Leterrier, who would later direct The Incredible Hulk with Edward Norton, and also directed the underrated Unleashed. The production company was able to keep on Luc Besson (director of The Professional, The Fifth Element) and a $35,000,000 budget compared to the original's $20,000,000. What you get is a very enjoyable and action packed movie with some very creative fight sequences (watch for the use of a fire hose) a better looking movie (cinematography wise and a crisper image) and great special effects. The acting isn't bad either. Sure Jason Statham isn't the greatest and i hated Kate Nauta (the very hot ""assasin-like"" girlfriend of the bad guy) but the role of the ""cook"", who is really a french inspector, was a great comic relief, and the mother of the kidnapped boy played by Amber Valetta was believable. Keith David had a good role as a as the FBI agent investigating the kidnapping. It's a great movie, if you don't think about it.

I sort of can't blame you if you do, but you can sit through that much and then leave, because you're not missing out on anything after that.This movie not only had plot holes large enough to drive a commercial fleet of semis through, but it had some of the worst writing and most horribly-delivered lines in the history of the craft known as screen-writing. I was willing to let a few of the less-likely stunts go by because this movie was established early-on as unrealistic. Which is fine! I can sit back and let stuff like that go.Jason Statham was picturesque as he always is, reminding us once again why its a travesty that Vin Diesel picked up the Agent 47 role in the upcoming Hit-man movie based on the game.

The writers and director make frank out to be not a mere astute wheelman and fighter, but rather a one man army, a superman of sorts. they packed in more choreographed nonsense than the average Jackie Chan movie. I seriously cannot say enough bad things about this director. A few times he made a nod in Sergio Leone's direction, but minus the brilliance that director was known for. The fight scene with the female assassin near the end was so crouching tiger-esquire it made me literally shout obscenities at the screen. The final showdown on the plane was so predictable that the second the plane was introduced onto the screen, my friend said ""here comes your BIG Hollywood ending."", he was right. Just pointless overacted tripe. Those scenes on the plane looked like an episode of the Thunderbirds circa 1966. As for the driving, this movie is packed so full of CGI car stunt nonsense it's sickening. CGI can look fake, but this...this looks like adobe photo-shop bad. The bomb on the car and hook on the crane thing, had me shaking my head. and you know who i feel the worst for, Jason Statham, because they ruined this character big time, using this sequel to try to make him the next Mega-action Hero. This movie is to the transporter series what Blade:trinity was to that series. Convoluted, self-absorbed, unintelligent, cinematic rubbish.

Our hero frank has a bomb on the bottom of his car, which he manages to get off by flipping the car and catching the bomb on an overhead hook, then landing right side up once again. However, these are all guilty pleasures, and if you let yourself go, then it is quite enjoyable.Without going into a lot of detail, there's a virus that a Colombian assassin type drug dealer type (our bad guys are rather anonymous) has been paid to unleash to an official of some sort, and does so by getting through to his son, which Frank happens to be 'transporting' these days. Our virus scenes are reminiscent of the chimera in M:I2, but not quite so thought out or understandable. The dialog between the young boy's divorced parents is incredibly horrible, and the transitions from scene to scene may very well put Ed Wood Jr. To shame.But I'm not the critical type. If you're looking for a nice September/summer action movie- this is the place for you. I give this a 4 simply because in terms of everything but the fight scenes- it's horrible. If I were to rate this against Jet Li's Unleashed, or xXx- state of the Union, it would be in the 7/8 category.

In my opinion, his accent made him sound more stupid than dangerous. He was not a good villain, and I believed they should've replaced him. Kate Nauta, however, was a brilliant villain.Now here are a couple flaws that they should've fixed.First of all, they shouldn't have made the poison green, and the antidote purple. It makes the movie to 1960's Bond-style. It looks like an old thriller movie that tries to look modern.Second, the death of Lola (Kate Nauta) was too anticlimactic. I loved her as a villain and thought she did a brilliant job; but I was like wtf when I saw her fighting with beads, then dying some anticlimactically.Although I understand that the movie's fiction and I should enjoy the unrealities of it, the part where he flew his car to detach the bomb under it was just too unrealistic.The plane fight scene was horrible, and the CG done on the plane was too. Enough said.The fight scenes were a bit mundane. It was typical karate and making use of one's surroundings. It was a Jackie Chan/James Bond. I think they should've given him a special move (e.g. Brad Pitt's air slice in Troy, or Jet Li's back break kick in Cradle 2 The Grave).Again, the idea of an airborne virus was stupid. Use it only to kill the drug administration? Why not take over the world dumbass? All in all, I thought the rest of the movie was brilliantly done. I relished the awesome bad-assedness of Kate Nauta.

Good things are they left it open for a sequel, but on the next go around I might just wait for it to come out on video. The acting was all sub par except for the hot girl and Jason, the little kid was probably one of the worst child actors I've ever seen and you could tell when they had to cut the camera tell him his line and then start again.

Others have quoted Bond as similar, mainly in the action scenes. Yet the most important difference between a Bond movie and especially Luc Besson movies is: Watching Bond movies, I *can* forget about physics. Here I could not. In Bond movies, watching Bond do physically impossible tricks/stunts/you name it is *fun*; here, it just is ridiculous. I guess the reason is the overall plot of Bond movies, which serves as a the glue to ""bond"" all the action into an entertaining whole, some better, some worse. The plot is so stereotype here that the boringness only is exceeded by the nonsense of the action. Worse, the supposedly funny parts are even more ridiculous, and just make you wish that the movie would end already.Stay away unless you like Hong Kong action movies. Of that kind of action this movie has plenty, and if you even find this kind of action funny, then you might be able to get more out if Transporter 2 than I did.One final remark: The name could have been ""Ransom 2"", ""Man on Fire 2"" or just ""Auto Race 325"", it wouldn't have made a difference.",Transporter 2

Now he seems to have taken some super juice and no one or nothing can touch him. you just have to see how he gets rid of a bomb under his car.The plot is wafer thin at best and the characters are plodding, the misuse of a great actor like Keith David is criminal and the cliché ridden acting of the main villains is laughable. Why oh why does every film made or involving Miami have to include the Columbian cartels or an allusion to them in some way?

Number 2, on the other hand, is only enhanced by the females in it. I enjoyed the parallels between original and sequel, with original cast members being employed along with mannerisms from the original. However, the sequel excelled in all areas, like fight scenes, car chases and plot.

The plot is kinda fuzzy at first but when you get into the movie it becomes more clear to what is actually happening but this film is really about plot its about the fantastic and fast paced action scenes. A lot of the action scenes are animated because in real life some of the things what go on in this movie are not humanly possible but hay who cares its an action movie.

Although some characters are quite  likable - they are rather poor crafted stereotypes.I don't want to spoil anything here so I just say that the story clearly plays second fiddle to the action- lots of things are left unexplained or not shown at best. The movie is really fast paced and fast cut so are the fighting sequences pretty similar to ""Kiss of the Dragon"" for example. The martial arts and action in general is really good but some of it is so far flung from reality that even the action enthusiast sitting next to me suspiciously raised an eyebrow especially at the end - sometimes it felt more like a superhero movie than like an action movie from France.If you are going to see the movie leave your brain at home and you will have an entertaining time - if you are not prepared to do that stay home together with you brain.",Transporter 2

After watching it a second time, however, I warmed to it. Maybe Jason Stratham and that Asian babe had really planted themselves inside my consciousness.But Transporter 2? I can't see myself ever loving this mess.Video game movies (not literally film adaptations of video games, but movies that suspend reality to the point of it resembles a video game, a la Charlie's Angels) don't upset me, and it's certainly not the sensibilities of this movie that drive me nuts.The good things? The outrageous outfits of Lola, the over-the-top fighting and improbable action sequences.The bad things? Look, I know this isn't a film-school archetype, but let's get real. The acting was horrible. Painful, even. Matthew Modine's performance came off as the most crass paycheck-grab in recent memory. And Stratham? Well, he elevates ""emotionless bad ass"" to a new level of rigidity. The car chase sequences, particularly involving the one with Lola, Frank running from the cops, was filmed with a disturbing lack of passion - as if the director forgot that close ups, slow motion, or even camera angles existed.Actually, never mind about the other stuff.

I can honestly say that this movie was excellent, even more so than the first film.The action scenes and martial arts are, undoubtedly very cool. A bit over-the-top, but what do you expect from an action film? I loved every minute of action this movie had to offer.The story is not very original, to say the least. But it works and I still found it interesting. It's the typical story line you would come to expect from a movie like this. Just be prepared not to think too much on this one and you should enjoy it as much as I did.The Transporter 2 has a few CGI scenes to offer, and they really could have been a bit better, but being that computer effects aren't the main focus of the movie, and being that there's not very many of them, they don't ruin the movie in the least.Overall, Transporter 2 is a VERY entertaining movie. If you liked the first, you'll love this. The only real problem that I had was that a little bit of the dialogue was pretty bad, even for what I was expecting in those terms. Also, the movie was short, but I was impressed at all that was fit into the 88 minutes that this movie ran.

If it were kept in the realms of Europe, it would have slightly been a different story. Jason Statham's poor American accent magnified by the lack of any suitable storyline left the writers scrambling to hire the first cliché artist they could find. The whole premise of the movie was terrible CG, a petty story, awful acting, and an unbelievable anorexic woman whose acting abilities are about as short-reached as the possibility of Statham beating a 300lb thug with cornrows senseless. This, compiled with the heavy sponsorship advertising by Audi and the Apple Ipod. The only decent acting in this whole picture came from the French Detective from the original picture, though his script was also quite unsuitable.

I went with my cousins, who always got to do a lot of things I didn't. Transporter, the first, brought me back to that golden feeling I had after seeing Goldfinger: exotic locations, exotic women and an artfully understated man's man hero. The only difference between Jason Statham's Frank Martin and Bond, is that Frank is less self-assured with women in distress. Transporter 2, unfortunately, loses that magic boundary. You can almost see yourself as James Bond. You could never see yourself as Frank because the stunts are physically and cartoonically unreal and the martial arts fight scenes are as believable as WWW wrestling. Even though the door was closed to the land of Mitty, it was open to an entertaining ride. If writer, Besson, would return to the élan of the first Transporter, I think he could establish a franchise to rival Bond. If he doesn't, I think Transporter 3 will be the last.

271,wingnuts,Surprisingly not rubbish.,6,13 August 2006,"When I first discovered they were making another Transporter movie I was pretty disappointed. It didn't seem necessary to try and out-do the first one, which had come out of no-where and firmly established Jason Statham as one the best action stars around today. And as it was set in America and (oh god!) involved a kid, I wasn't expecting anything even remotely like the first. However, I'll give it it's due and say that as leave-your-brain-at-the-door action flick, it works. It doesn't try too hard and there's only enough of a plot to tie everything together without getting in the way of the action. The acting at times borders on awful and the dialogue can be painful to listen to (Jason Flemyng's stereotypical Russian is just terrible) but there no need to give any of that attention when Statham is on screen. The action pieces are brilliant. From the opening fight sequence to the first car chase and beyond, you can't help but enjoy yourself. They dance that fine line between entertaining and ridiculous very well and while they are over the top the whole movie never attempts to say that any of it could actually happen. While I would still say this was an unnecessary sequel to make, they could have done a lot worse. It does fall apart at the end, mostly due to the fact they have to tie up the story some how, and I did feel that we got robbed of a decent end fight between Lola and Frank, there's no reason why you can't sit back and enjoy this movie for what it is, mindless entertainment.",Transporter 2

It did have an entertainment value and kept me guessing, but I was just guessing at what the production team was thinking when they made some of the choices they made.

276,The-Internet,I plan on stabbing out my eyes to relieve the pain resulting from the intake of the film.,1,1 October 2005,"First there are a number of positive things that can indeed be said about this ""film"". As a stand alone movie, its a romp, a great Dukes of Hazzard including viruses adventure. Lots of gratuitously enjoyable T & A, action so densely packed you need to blink a little more often than normal to get ready for the next scene. And lots of good clean action-film fun. However, this was NOT a stand alone movie, it had a basis of rules we have come to expect this universe to obey. It had a very well laden rather uncommonly found, and well built foundation, and it is obvious that the makers of this film decided to completely ignore that foundation, thusly as a sequel Transporter 2, well, what can be said is that this was one of the worst sequels ever, why? Because it obeyed all the tried and true bad sequel rules, the most major two of which are addition of flavors, and acceleration of importance, both of these, thrown in with a brand new love interest, and a near cameo-appearance type performance by François Berléand, where he played a masterful and taught protagonist in disguise in the first movie, he played something more on par with Brain, the dog character from the inspector gadget cartoon, whilst the transporter himself, turned from a simple character with simple values, into an international super spy, relying more on gadgets and stealth, than his fists or personal cunning, but i digress, back to my previous point. The addition of a female assassin, who is so sexy she in fact does not wear a full set of clothing once in the movie, her entire wardrobe consisting of lingerie, and fishnets, with the occasional super thin robe, just screams desperation from the filmmakers, as an addition of flavor. While the first movie, had a more humanitarian plot, as the problem in question was not plaguing the planet, had it continued, it would not be on ones doorstep, but none the less is a hot political topic, whilst, the sequel, was more James Bond (not bad mouthing the legend mind you) and over the top than anything, as an acceleration of importance, this is supposed to put you into a state of recognition as a REAL threat, whereas this scale of global threat, presented in this fashion, was too unreal to ever even begin to believe. If nothing said so far as put this movie in bad perspective, then let me sum up the worst of scenes, in the entire movie for you, a bomb, threatening to detonate soon, is attached to the bottom of the transporter's super car, and so faced with this threat he decides to jump his car over a docking area, very close to a dangling chain with a hook on the end, so close in fact, that it hits the bomb attached to the bottom of the car hard enough to yank it off, without altering the trajectory of the car at all.

The storyline isn't too bad either, although it has been over played just a little.If your looking for a similar storyline, but with a more realistic feel, then Out Of Time (Denzel Washington) is the film for you.But if your looking to spend a Saturday evening in-front of the box with your partner and Kids (teen kids), then rent this, get some pop-corn and sweets and enjoy the action over a beer.

281,neocorvis,Transporter 2: Guilty Pleasure,10,11 May 2006,"Transporter 2 is one of the finest examples of a guilty pleasure if I ever saw one. A genuine crowd pleaser, with enough testosterone to keep the men happy, and enough of Jason Statham for the girls. Full of over the top action (one scene in particular causing the audience I saw it with to cheer in unison), and low on plot, this is a film you watch with a smile on your face from start to finish. If you see it expecting a serious movie then you've missed the point of the film completely. the Transporter series, and number two in particular, are pure and simply cheese. Think 80s Schwarzenegger and you'll get the general idea.Transporter 2: You either love it, or hate it. You choose",Transporter 2

According to me we go to movie for entertainment, to make ourselves fresh and relax. I am assuring by watching that movie you people will not feel bored.But airplane sequence that was at the end in the movie was not looking real.when Jeason aka Frank tries to enter in airplane.

""Slightly"" over-the-top stunts - but not so extreme, given the genre! Whilst I like the film, I still think Leterrier et al should do their homework on car chases (i.e. see Ronin, Bullitt etc. again). Car chases can be beautiful as well as exciting, but this film is only part way there. Nevertheless, the car chases are above average.Some people have criticized the film for being derivative. I prefer to see it as homage - to lots of great films including various James Bonds, MI2, even the Blues Brothers. What we get here is a nice mix of mostly familiar ingredients, put together in a good, solid, entertaining way with a nice little twist at the end that left me wanting more.",Transporter 2

It may have a few parts that just don't seem realistic- but hey, it's an Action movie. Since when do action movies have to be totally real? This is a great movie, I highly recommend it, especially if you enjoyed the first Transporter. The acting is great, the background stories, sound. The film sequences of action with the dialogs all work, and Jason Statham again helps to solidify his role as an excellent actor. Highly recommended, only 7/10 because this is one of those movies that if you watch consistently over and over, you miiiight get a little bored of it, but it's great for an instant pure adrenaline rush.",Transporter 2

You will see a lot of funny things, like Audi car is an Abrams tank which will never get damaged, even pass through the wall or jumping from building to building or being shoot by automatic guns  no problem with it so far.Movie has messy story (actually no one), but yet the movie has nice scenes which will fit your offline brain, being turned off. :-)Conclusion: if you want to just see fragmented Wow!-action  this movie is for you.

I really enjoyed Transporter I and was anticipating a second that would have been at least just as slick as its predecessor. What I found was a sloppy attempt to spurt out another film to make money. There were fight scenes where I realized there was no music. If I closed my eyes all I would hear would be clanging and sighs, sounds that could've just been done in a studio. The second film, I suppose tried to build more story and less action, but that took away from the appeal of the movie. The antagonists were unconvincing, borderline comical and were over the top. Statham should've turned down this offer. Unlike the first, it was made with no effort for coolness.",Transporter 2

Well here I go.I've been trying to catch this movie on TV for quite a while, and 3 hours ago, I did. After seeing ""Transporter 1"" I was eager to see this movie since I liked the first one so much. All in all I think this movie is great, many say that it is not realistic and that kind of ruins the movie, I honestly don't think so, it's not so unrealistic, yes some parts are *spoiler?*(cars flying from building to building)*spoiler?* but that doesn't really mess up the movie from my point of view.The storyline is great, after seeing the first one I think this is a nice change for the second one, I love the driving scenes, fighting scenes, shooting scenes, stealth scenes, everything. I also liked the way that this movie kind of added some comedy in the middle of all the action.Also this movie has a great cast, Jason Statham is one of my favorite actors and I still haven't even seen ""Crank"" (supposed to be his best movie.) Alessandro Gassman does a great job being the ""bad guy"" in this movie. Amber Valletta did a great job in this movie though I don't think Matthew Modine (Mr. Billings) put on his best acting.So that is my review for this movie, if you have seen it I hope you agree on some of the stuff i've said, if you haven't go watch it, you will enjoy it.Antonio",Transporter 2
288,jawad_jaffer,the best action movie ever made after die hard ....,10,1 October 2007,"My new column, THE DEVIL'S HAMMER, appears every Monday on fromthebalcony.com. Coming up Sept. 5: Tropiciana's Pietro Musetto Restaurant, 2 Blind Items, Natalee Hollway, Uri Geller's Bent Tennis Racket, Ivana Trump's LV Project, The Ethiopian Prisoner, Aristole Onassis, and more Frank Martin (Jason Statham) is a driver-for-hire. Instead of operating out of his headquarters in the French Mediterranean, Frank is now in Miami driving a cute 6-year-old kid, Jack Billings (Hunter Clary), to school. Jack's father is an insanely wealthy drug czar and his mother, Audrey (Amber Valletta), is a neglected, frustrated wife. It's a temporary position suited for a man who doesn't talk much, has no friends, no lovers, and is someone who can leap tall buildings, dodge machine gun bullets, and drives like a demon. He doesn't need a gun.When he is overtaken by a killing machine named Lola (Kate Nauta), he is forced to allow kidnapper Gianni (Alessandro Gassman) take Jack for a $5 million ransom. Luckily for Frank, he has a ""friend"" from France, Tarconi (Francoise Berleand), who is arrested in his house and spends some quality time in a police station as they sort out his police credentials. Tarconi helps Frank track the kidnappers. The purpose of the kidnapping is not only a ransom; Gianni has been contracted to inject little Jack with an airborne virus that will kill any he breathes on. And Mr. Billings, who has paid the ransom, is set to address a huge international drug conference.Frank has to find the antidote.Driving a car that would make James Bond envious  a black Audi A8 that is invulnerable to car crashes or flying across bridges and tall buildings  Frank is masterful at using anything available to assault Lola and her team of assassins. Frank can drive that car even though he is being chased by every police car in Miami. When out of the car, Frank can crucify a brutal team of killers with a fire hose. The fight on the plane is thrilling and martial arts choreographer Cory Yuen has succeeded in pushing the outrageous, unrealistic fight scenes to the limit of credibility. But who cares if it is fantasy? No one even stops for a red light or gets anywhere near a bullet. Director Louis Leterrier knows how to excite. I actually shouted a few times.The screenwriters, the film's producer Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen, stay true to the stoic character of Frank Martin. The only humor comes from Tarconi, but it is dry and he is not the silly sidekick. Statham has now entered the movie star domain and Frank Miller is now a golden franchise for him. He has an appealing sex appeal and a strong cinematic presence. I personally want to see more of Gianni and Lola. Alessandro Gassman, do not be seduced by Hollywood and take a role as Sandra Bullock's European boyfriend in a romantic comedy. You are a terrific villain. We need you. I still cringe at the feminized villain in the last 007 movie. And Kate Nauta? Keep Lola around for a few more movies.",Transporter 2

Jason Statham gives us a likable turn as Frank Martin, and the rest of the cast aren't bad either. The plot is complete and utter nonsense but is interesting. The stunts are completely over the top, but great fun to watch and very inventive (watermelon boxing gloves!). The film never takes itself too seriously and remains tongue in cheek the whole way through. Yes, it's all silly implausible nonsense, but remains very entertaining silly nonsense. Worth a watch if you want a mindlessly fun action movie. If you want something more intelligent, you'll have to look elsewhere, but I've seen far stupider films than this.",Transporter 2

So when I went to see it I was expecting an exciting storyline with lots of action. How wrong I was. Instead I had a film with an invincible Audi and pointless fight scenes thrown in for the sake of it. The film had the potential to be good. But the storyline was clichéd and it was too samey to many other action films around. It was also like they had a storyline and just added the fight scenes, car chases and explosions to spice it up in bland parts. Explosions here and there, a fight scene maybe... Oh lets not forget the countless car chases and even a normal wooden door that blocks bullets. Save your money on something with a bit more substance",Transporter 2

There are parts in this movie that the other reviewer mentioned that  make no sense, particularly the wrecking ball thing and the plane  thing, you really have to stretch yourself...  But the fact is when it comes down to it 95% of the action is so  ORIGINAL, and Inventive, and most of all stylish that you can't help  being entertained. If you can get over the fact that its less an action  movie than a super hero movie,I mean Frank Martin (the transporter) is  a god, you'll have loads of fun. Don't invest too much emotion into the  story line, its dumb, Hell I watched it in french and I couldn't even  tell the little details and I still new what was going on and that the  story was dumb.

The music, action and everything bonds together extremely well to form an excellent show! Jason Statham is awesome, and though there are a few unbelievable parts, the action sequences will have any audience on the edge of their seats. I'm a major Luc Besson fan (Fifth Element), so it is no surprise that I fell in love with this movie. The music is so good, I went out & bought the soundtrack (great driving music, by the way!). Kate Nauta plays an excellent role, and is multi-talented (she wrote and sang at least one song on the soundtrack, ""Revolution"").

I have seen Jason Statham in some decent roles, but the writing, acting and silly scenes in this Eurotrash movie were really bad. I wonder why they think something like this will really work. The French need to stick to doing what they do best, small art films that nobody but the French care about.

295,RoninProd,"""This is the one - we gonna do it like it ain't been done before!""",6,3 September 2005,"Jason Statham is a bad a--. What else can I say? The guy damn near makes me like anything he's in or at the very least enhances it with his presence. I wasn't a big fan of the original TRANSPORTER. I thought that the first half hour was very good for what it was and then it felt like they brought in a completely different screenwriter. To me, it felt like they had created a cool, entertaining villain in the character portrayed by Matt Schulze and then had just forgotten and replaced him with some Chinese slave trader and turned the anti-hero (Statham's character) into and out and out good guy. All big mistakes, in my opinion. Anyway, needless to say the only reason I went to TRANSPORTER 2 was because I'm a big fan of Statham's on screen(He will end up making me drag myself to Uwe Boll's latest assault on the cinema next year when he stars in DUNGEON SIEGE as well) and because the trailer looked so cool and fun. So what did I think? TRANSPORTER 2 is a good time at the movies. That's it, plain and simple. It doesn't try to be more than it is, steals music from the SIN CITY trailer which ends up working really, really well, and is short and to the point -- only something like an hour and twenty minutes I believe. Is some of the film just plain ridiculous? Sure, most of it is. Some of it is very ridiculous. But this time around I think the filmmakers knew exactly how ridiculous it was and knew how and where to take it. Actually, its ridiculousness is a lot of what is so fun about it. There's a jet ski vs. school bus chase, a -- kicking with a fire hose, and a fight with a huge Jamaican in a boat that is just down right hysterical. Even still,there's a shot with a half-naked assassin named Lola shooting down a cartoon helicopter (worst CGI I've seen in a while) from a parking garage that should have just ended up on the cutting room floor. It was so bad that there really was just no excuse (or a reason for it to happen at all in the film for that matter) but since the rest of it is so much fun, I'll let it slide.I'll make it clear though. TRANSPORTER 2 is ridiculous. But being just plain ridiculous and being ridiculous fun are two totally different things. In my opinion, this second outing of Frank Martin way out tops the original -- by a landslide. I'd watch a third no question. Give me the far less expensive TRANSPORTER series over the mega budget XXX's any day of the week. As a matter of fact the only way to get me in a third XXX is to cast Jason Statham as XXX -- now there's an idea, Neil Moritz. Next time out though, I wonder will they call it ""THE"" TRANSPORTER 3 or just plain TRANSPORTER 3? Maybe even TRANSPORTER III? Who knows? Who cares? I'd see it either way. B- RATINGS GUIDE: A (Go see it now no questions asked); A- (excellent, well worth the trip); B (very good); B- (pretty good); C (okay); C-(disappointing but not a total waste of time); D (bad); D- (very, very bad); F (don't see it  trust me I can even be lenient).",Transporter 2

Jason Statham plays this character well and gets his own laughs from the audiences. My favorite part of the movie was the little boy, played by Hunter Clary. He is cute, funny and was a great part to this movie. The return of Berleand as Turconi adds many laughs too!

The first one was shot like an indie film with a better budget, great location, great cast, and a good and believable story. I loved the film and bought the DVD right away.Part 2 with a bigger budget allowed the producers to shoot a film a la Michael Bay. Quick cuts, very bad and unnecessary CGI effects, a way too overwhelming scenery with too many black suits agents acting very important, textbook action a la James Bond, a not so believable bad guy with his high power girlfriend (who needed her??), Russian henchmen like in any other film, a child that looks Cuban but his parents are non Hispanics, etc. And again BAD CGI. Overall an action film like any other. The producers could have easily saved 10 million on the budget by keeping it more low key and more realistic.

Even Rambo was more believable, as we see Frank moving down a corridor literally stepping side to side to avoid bullets shot from only feet away! The movie is full of action that pushes the boundaries of believability way too far, further than I can remember any action movie doing for a long time, and leaves one leaving the theater feeling they have just seen one of the stupidest movies of the year.

I would have loved to have seen a better end battle sequence with the femme fa tale Lola. I would have liked to seen her pretty neck snapped by Statham than die on some wall hanging. And the end fight with what's his name in the plane left me more nauseated than interested. The story was poor, acting even worse, and personally, I after seeing Lola in the skimpy outfits for more than ten minutes, it got old. I mean, they make them out to be really tough, and what happens 45 seconds later Lola is dead and the unmemorable guy who supposedly could take on 5 guys in a ken-do match gets paralyzed in a brief fight after rolling around on a plane for a while.

I could smell it from all the way over by the sofa where I was sitting, but I got my hubby through and we both laughed our heads off, cos this film is so bad, it's good. Jason Statham has the weirdest accent. He's straight from the ""transatlantic, cor-luv-a-duck Michael Caine, Carey Grant, I think I'm a Yank but actually I'm a lovable barrelful of Cockney monkeys"" school of acting. And everything he said sounded like it had been dubbed on afterwards, after he's been asked in post-production to drink a pint of neat testosterone. If you told me that's how they made it, I wouldn't be surprised. The colours were all a bit day-glo. Matthew Modine and his slutty-acting wife, didn't look anything like their little boy either, which worried my husband somewhat, but I just said the boy probably looked like the previous chauffeur, because that wife wasn't any better than she ought to be. And the baddies! What's with the lassie in the Lara Croft outfit blasting the sh *t out of everyone with two guns at once? It was like a character from a video game had shown up on screen. And her eye make up made her look like a robot, but maybe that was the effect she was going for anyway. I liked Jason Statham when he drove his car (which I think was KITT's cousin from Knight Rider) off a pier, twirled it in midair so that a handy chain could knock the bomb off the bottom of the car without exploding the car. A nifty move, one that I often accomplish when I get a car bomb under my car in suburban London and need to get rid of it quick smart while chasing a bunch of Russian ne'er-do-wells. I mean, it was like watching my life on the screen, the gritty realism of it was just off the scale! I don't really get who the friend with the French accent was all about.

That's why I paid, that was the 1st movie had promised me.... And what did I watch in total?

Even when the plane crashed in the ocean, no problem for the guys . . .So unrealistic, even Superman would have a dizziness from all this, but not these actors . . .2.

Vehicles jumping from one high rise into another which is 8-10 stories lower and then driving off unscathed. A 50' high ramp jump with the car rotating 360 degrees side over side into mid air in order to make use of an 8"" iron hook dangling from the cable on a construction crane followed by the vehicle landing again on all fours and continuing on. I just knew that Wiley Coyote and the Road Runner had to appear at any minute.Dodging bullets in a hallway after they have been fired from the gun from 20 feet away..........Whats even more salt in the wound is the fact that the story is weak and most of the acting is too. He starts out as a babysitter and never gets beyond it or even comes close to the role he played in 1. There is absolutely no comparison to this and the original Transporter. It was like no one involved in this production even saw the first one. I walked out about 20-30 min before the scheduled end. A total waste of time.",Transporter 2
308,thelardfather,See if you can count how many times you find yourself laughing in disbelief. I lost count in the twenties...,6,6 September 2005,"In his time, James Bond has done some pretty unbelievable things. I've seen him pull a wheelie in an articulated lorry full of cocaine, i've witnessed him skiing off a cliff and i've even watched him ride a motorbike off a cliff to catch a plane which is plummeting to the bottom of a ravine. Far fetched stuff indeed. However, this is nothing compared to some of the stunts in Transporter 2. Whilst, they certainly are impressive and the stunt team should be congratulated at times they are so surreal it makes a mockery of the plot. The main character can seemingly dodge bullets, survive plane crashes into the ocean, jump from skyscraper to skyscraper in his car and in true hero style beat off hoards of enemies who have axes and guns with little more than a hose (yup, just an ordinary hose) and some sharp moves.I'll admit so far this review sounds a little negative. It's not my intention to give this film a terrible review. Whilst, it is true that the action was at times a bit far fetched, it was an enjoyable film, a film where unlike real life, the good guy is always going to triumph over the bad guys no matter how unlikely that seems. And believe me, at times, it is unlikely.Basically, if you're looking for something for everyone and aren't looking for an intellectual masterpiece this film is a fun enjoyable movie that really is something the whole family can enjoy.

So after you finish your refreshing Ice Cold Pepsi Cola, turn off your Apple 40 GB iPod, call your friends with your NOKIA camera phone, jump into your reliable, astonishingly nimble Audi A8 or you Rugged, Stylish, 2005 Hummer2 and go see this movie!",Transporter 2
310,rafaelffmarinho,Awful,1,25 August 2005,"This has got to be one of the worst films I have ever seen in my life. Full of clichés, bad acting (to be kind) and one of the weakest screenplays ever written. People at the movie theater looked at utter disbelief as the movie unfolded. The film came out in Paris last week and already there were only seven people at the movie theater. Bad, Bad movie. Unlike the first Transporter which I actually enjoyed, the film has ""Man on Fire"" rip-off written all over it, however it does not hold to the same standards. It is truly surprising that an actor like Matthew Modine would choose to work in such a film. This is by far one of the worse films by Luc Besson, who by the way, should stay away from screenplay writing.",Transporter 2
311,aria_bianconeri,Non-stop action,10,10 September 2005,"I went in to the movie with a blank mind because I wasn't totally impressed with Transporter 1, but I have to admit, Transporter 2 blew me away!!!!!!!!! Total action from start to finish, plus the comic interludes makes it definitely one of my top 5 action films ever!!! That Audi looked so hot! Scraping the bomb off was quite a MacGyverish move, as was beating off the guys with the hose. Jason Statham looked sooo hotttt!!!! So really, WHO needs a superhero like Superman and Spiderman when you've got... THE TRANSPORTER!! I am going to have to see this movie at least 5 more times before the cinema changes movies, because with all the action there was I am sure I must've missed at least one thing when I blinked!I definitely need to get my very own DVD original copy!",Transporter 2
312,rdisgo,It was a Hollywood movie,5,4 September 2005,"If the movie had a sensible plot and toned down the way over the top sequences, the movie would have been entertaining.OK. The premise is understandable. The actors understand their roles. However, you never feel like there is real harm or peril. Maybe it was the production style.The fight sequences were cool, which I guess this is all the movie was about. The chase scenes were just to stupid for words... flying jet ski? car fits perfectly to roll over two buildings. Give me a break oh, and the bomb, if my car could maneuver like that... someone say handy crane? Anyway, if you want to see fight scenes, but silly plot....GO SEE THIS MOVIE!",Transporter 2

The CG graphics weren't all that great and were below average, but the fight scenes definitely made up for all that. I enjoyed the driving scenes as well.After what I had gathered from the previews and the previous film, I was honestly not expecting the kind of action scenes that were going to be showcased. It was some insane and very very fun stuff that was going on. This is a definite must-buy when it is released on DVD.I would recommend this movie for anyone who enjoys some exceptionally fast-paced and exciting action sequences. Crazy good stuff.",Transporter 2

I saw the first movie and I loved that too. Frank is a total bad ass and id love to see him in future transporter movies.Although some of the special effects of the movie are a little cheap I still found them to be excellent. And that car Frank drives is awesome. Now there's a Audi I wouldn't mind owning!Overall, id recommend Transporter 2 to any fan of the first Transporter, and to and to any fan of action movies.Don't judge this movie by what people write about it here. Go see it for yourself. I enjoyed it, and I hope you will too.",Transporter 2
316,Jeremy_Hoon,A terrible production,3,21 August 2005,"I saw this movie in France the week of August 15th. The following review contains a sprinkling of (hopefully) minor spoilers.It makes a good rental, I would think. It's European action which could have been done well within its small budget, but the producers seem to have insisted on adding some last minute flashiness that looks about as good as your typical video game. In one instance, a helicopter instantly vanishes and is replaced by an extremely brief pasted-to-the-screen explosion that looks like a mess of orange and yellow pixels.The movie often forgets what its about, at times serious enough to throw off the pace, other times silly-unrealistic to the level of a Saturday morning cartoon. The villains are poorly handled. There are two main bad-guys, a sort-of martial arts dude (he knows martial arts, but its not clear what he is), and his goth-ish kinky girlfriend who's supposed to be hot but isn't. They fight a good deal with Jason Statham, but otherwise henchmen appear whenever its convenient for the plot.Speaking of the plot, there are some very, very big holes. Jason Statham is the first to be exposed to a virus, but he never gets sick, and nothing is ever said about what happens to the other people who are exposed to the virus at the same time as he is.The movie has brilliant moments, however, such as when Jason Statham fights with a firehose. There is some amazing driving (the best drifting I've ever seen in a movie) but often the good driving veers from what's clearly real to CG madness.",Transporter 2
317,kelmfs,TRANSPORTER 2 summary,8,23 August 2005,"just saw ""Transpoter 2"" this morning, what an awesome film, it has a mix of action&suspense. I think a mix between Steven Segall's early stuff (Above The Law) and Jean Claude Van Damme. There is some really hot cars in this movie and some rather noticeable product placement, Should do fairly well when it comes out, if people can look past someone actually succeeding at trying some of the stunts in the movie, but then, hey it's just a movie, right. Should keep everyone on the edge of their seats and wanting a second or third helping of this film. I never saw the first Transporter, actually was unaware there ever was one, but I will definitely be checking it out, and after seeing this film, hopefully we have'not seen the last of this franchise.",Transporter 2
318,jerrydgeek,"Better than ""Con Air""",8,18 April 2006,"Hey, Sailor? Looking for a little action? I actually saw T2 (Transporter II, not Terminator II) before I saw the original. T1 was much smoother, provided better character development, and the stunts were not as over-done. For example, T1 had Fran drive his Beemer on the ridge-lines of two adjacent flat-roof buildings, which I thought was a straining the credibility of the viewer (does anyone who watches this type of movie have a problem with suspending incredibility? Probably not.)Stunts aside, the movie portrays Frank as someone who perhaps has learned to draw the line at kidnapping, in direct contrast to T1. Frankly (sorry) I find it easier to identify with someone who strives to rescue a young boy under his protection than I do with someone who will transport a kidnapped girl. There's something about a hero who has scruples which trumps a protagonist who has none.In a movie series which is obviously designed to go straight to DVD, with little or no release to the theater market, it's difficult to compare this with the Dolph Lundgren genre; Dolph is so ""Eighties"" that the comparison is unfair. Try comparing it to Jean Reno in ""Leon: The Professional"" (American Release) which incidentally introduced Natalie Portman who was later to play Padme Amadala in ""Attack of the Clones."" Sometimes you find a 'little movie' which turns out to be the predecessor to a classic series (if a cult flick), and spawns careers which you'll follow for years. I predict that this is one such movie, and highly recommend it.",Transporter 2
319,jetclean,Jason has done it again,10,26 August 2005,"Jason Statham has to be one of the greatest martial art actors of cinema for 2005. Transporter 2 has excellent sound and fighting sequences. I believe Jason got his inspiration for fighting after he made 'the one' with jet Li. I wish i could see Jason and jet battling it out in a movie 'possibly in transporter 3 or kiss of the dragon 2' jet kn do vs Wu sou would be a great cinema moment for millions to see. Jet Li is was a Wu sou champion before he was 18 Jason's has the technique of a Bruce lee master. Corey Yuen and Robert Rodriguez should team up and make a project like that. Their directing technique's will make it a master piece. WE all Know Jason and jet are the action stars of today but what happened to Van Dame, Steven Segal their European budget films are not as good as their American made productions. come on van and Steve kicks, hey maybe a good movie would be Jason and jet take on Steven and van Dame, imagine the limitations.",Transporter 2
320,crazylicious85,pretty good to have not seen Transporter I,6,2 September 2005,"I had not seen the first Transporter movie, so I wasn't sure what to expect, but I ended up liking the movie a lot more than I originally expected. The fight scenes are well choreographed but the story line was your typical 'hold someone for ransom' type story. I disliked the computer graphics....not even close to real looking. Other than that it was good. I'm not sure what the point was with what the bad girl was or wasn't wearing, but i guess that was for the guys that didn't enjoy the violent scenes enough. I personally could care less what she was or wasn't wearing. The plane scenes were so fake it was pathetic. It was very jackie chanish like one of the other reviews mentioned. I guess if you like violence and cool stunts, you will most likely enjoy this movie. I would like to see the first movie now that I have seen this one. Just to see if i missed anything from seeing the sequel first.",Transporter 2
321,bdtch2n,An old fashioned great action movie,10,2 September 2005,"I loved the first ""Transporter"" but not as much as Transporter 2. The action was over-the-top. Jason Statham continues to impress me: he outperforms James Bond, Triple X, and Bruce Willis in Die Hard. Driving scenes and stunts are excellent, the karate and fighting scenes are wildly entertaining, and sarcasm and humor are prevalent enough to break the tension. What impresses me the most, however, is that we have an adult, action movie that truly delivers without a constant flow of profanity, gratuitous bloodshed, or even what has become the standard fare of naked female bodies and sex. This movie provides entertainment the old fashioned way with a charming hero on a mission, a decent plot, great stunts and action, and sympathetic characters who depend on the hero for salvation. I can't wait for Transporter 3.",Transporter 2

Even my nonviolent Girlfriend loved this film my little brother went as well and he liked it all the cars and action, kinda like the first Transporter but the story is so much better in the second one. I couldn't stop watching it, I'm tempted to go watch it again honestly but I think I'll wait until it comes out on DVD which will be cool, I can't wait to see the behind the scenes and stunt stuff. I thought this movie had an awesome quality and good sense of humor here and there kinda like the first one but this honestly is the first sequel, That was as good or better than the original. Like Indiana Jones was always good or James Bond this movie for the hundredth time rocked. There was some funny Irony to the movie as well my girlfriend and I were watching TV when we first dated and The Transporter was on and it was the first movie we saw, on our anniversary the second one comes out so we decided to go watch it, so you guys had good timing in a weird romantically way, lol..

Yet an ordinary story, but a must see for every action fan.A former special force soldier Frank with lots of war experience works as a driver and bodyguard. The person he is supposed to protect becomes a target of some Columbian drug terrorists. They invented virus and anti virus (reminds of mission impossible 2). so the story develops and finishes in a ordinary pattern. Frank is an interesting character as through the movie he never uses a gun. He disarms his opponents and does some fine kung fu like techniques worth a comparison with Jackie Chan.We definitely want to see more of this director!",Transporter 2

Save your self a few bucks and put it towards a pair of pliers to remove your own teeth with for entertainment instead. Sure I didn't expect much in the lines of a plot. I was just looking for my fix of barely dressed women, fast cars, guns, and random violence just like the rest of you. And although this film contains all of the above. The sheer stupidity of cars flying upside down, over, and through buildings with jets that fall straight from the atmosphere into the ocean without hurting anyone inside is even enough to ruin the images of Kate Nauta's scantly dressed body.

The fighting scenes are a riot to watch and I may be wrong but there seemed to be a few more of them than in the first movie.All in all it I think the transporter movies may replace the James Bond movies my generation watched as we grew up.

The physics are alittle far fetched, like doing a corkscrew flips with a full sized car and smashing throw a cement wall off a roof top and landing it perfectly on a floor on another building without a scratch. The acting is excellent and you get alittle more then pg-13 in a few scenes, mainly little pecks at a females butt but nothing to bad. I liked the Jackie Chan like moves that were in the fighting scenes. It has a few funny parts in the movie but nothing to make the hole theater laugh.

I agree that there should have been more Martial Arts then car chases(imagine this coming from a martial artist) but all in all it was a descent action movie. In my opinion, Jason Statham is one of the top martial artist in the movie industry today. His technique, control, and power are excellent. He is not as showy as VanDamme was but does have some flashy moves. He works well with props like Jackie Chan but does not over do them. He makes the movie what it is, fun. A good action packed (of course not much of a plot) movie that is just fun to go see. Well worth $7 I paid to see it at the cinemas.",Transporter 2

I wasn't out to the theaters looking for the movie of the century, just a flick to enjoy with my buddy; more something to do than anything else. But it was so bad I left feeling pick-pocketed - ""Thanks for your money, Sucker!"" The theatrics were OK and Statham marshaled all of his acting skills for a semblance of a good performance. But they were no match for the overwhelming limitations of the writers. A kid in grade-school could do better. You could see where Kamen's ideas, the guy who wrote the first film, were slaughtered by Besson and his blind vision of what he believed were the ingredients of a blockbuster film... leading to inevitable catastrophe.I want my money back.",Transporter 2
329,jennifer-373,Please - Just stop talking...,3,7 September 2005,"Transporter 2 doesn't even come CLOSE to being what The Transporter was and the audience is left feeling the burn. Just for a moment let's suspend our disbelief of Leterrier's disgustingly fragile grip on reality. Let's not debate that there was no reason for Straham's character to be doing half the things he did or the fact that the acting was so bad it was almost unbearable - Straham aside; Transporter 2 doesn't even come close to matching the steady heart-pumping action of its predecessor.The driving was predominantly boring and scant. The music was completely underdone and instead of adding to the pace, served only to drag the movie down all the more. Two of the best facets that made The Transporter really interesting were completely shoved aside and for what? Matthew Modine? Please. I could act my way better out of a wet paper bag! The script explains nothing to us about where Frank Martin has been, how he's ended up in Miami, what's happened to our beautifully, gagged package from The Transporter, Lai. We start up in the middle of a parking garage, where for some reason our expert (and ex-military bad ass) is sitting waiting for school to let out.The fight scene in the garage, which should have been there to set the stage and build the tempo, is slow and pointless and when you finally find out the contents of the package Frank is off to grab, you're left feeling as you did when you walked into The Pacifier to see action man, Vin Diesel, play babysitter to a bunch of kids.Add to all of this the cheese factor of the movie, and you have to do a lot more than suspend your disbelief. You have to be able to choke down why none of the bad guys ever shoot their gun when they're in range of Stratham's character, or why the blonde bimbo who can't act can level a doctor's office but still can't hit Stratham through a wooden door with two semi-automatics.I love Jason Stratham and I loved The Transporter, but only because it was just trying to be what it was. It had fantastic music, an incredibly artistic style and the use of François Berléand was perfectly delightful. However, Transporter 2 lost the pulse and the original flavor of the first and left this fan sincerely disappointed and afraid to go back for more.",Transporter 2

The thing is, a plot must make itself believable within its setting. If its setting is in outer space, then naturally there are greater possibilities (which is why there are some many kick-butt alien movies). But the action in the Transporter is so unbelievable that you don't even get excited when something exciting is supposedly happening. Its too good to be true, so its lame. The best comparison I can make is to the popular conception of Benny Hinn. If he is really healing people, that is one thing; however, most people don't think he ever could so he just looks silly up there...as does our protagonist in the Transporter.",Transporter 2
332,Shibby2269,No where near as good as the first,5,9 September 2005,"Now, I'd like to start off saying that I loved the first movie; I loved everything about it. But this movie lacked much of what made the first movie great.Sure, this movie has all the over the top action and fight scenes that it needs to qualify it as a sequel to the Transporter. The problem is that all the cheesy action wasn't what made the first one an entertaining movie. It was the way it created such a great main character. His rules, his ability to drive, and his job; it all added to his ""cool"" factor. Now, take all that made him cool and change it so that it's only a fraction or non-existent. He has one scene where his driving skills are really shown, the movie never really plays off his ""rules"" very well, and his job, you know...the transporting part, yeah...that's gone.Now, there are plenty of other things I could complain about in this movie, like some really stupid situations or way, way over the top action (it makes XXX look like it was set in reality), but it does have its moments where you can't help but sit back and welcome some of the charm from the first movie. This movie handles its fight scenes fairly well, but not as memorable as the first one's oil fight and it has a few nice driving segments, but nothing compared to the intensity of the first films opening scene.All in all, I recommend renting it if it interests you, otherwise, feel free to pass this up.

I have no problem believing that, because this one was so awful that virtually anything could've been better.The acting was cheesy and the beyond-unbelievable plot was the result of a bunch of FX-lovers sitting in a room saying ""Ooh, and NOW wouldn't it be cool if..."" Much of the silliness has been covered in other reviews, and if the movie had contained any element of a wink or a hint that it was working towards being a parody of the genre, rather than taking itself seriously, I could've sat back and laughed with the rest. The movie includes a number of plot elements that are absolutely useless to the movie - including: a fight scene where the villain practices kendo against 6-8 of his henchmen and the psychotic female sidekick to the villain who wears lingerie and must have been in Cirque du Soleil before deciding to join the ""dark side.""As an example of the unbelievable action, the movie includes a fight in a pilotless Lear jet. Just as the jet crashes into the ocean, the hero, who is standing in the aisle at the instant of the crash, leaps towards the back of the plane to survive the crash. He then puts a life preserver on the stunned villain and swims him to the surface just in time for a number of rescue boats (who must have all conveniently been right out of range of the shock wave from the plane hitting the water but still close enough to be in the right spot in a matter of seconds) to arrive.I shudder to think what Transporter 3 will be like.",Transporter 2

I like the link back with Transporter 1 with the French cop and the subtle joke as he answers the door. Quite frankly this movie had potential to be so much more. They obviously had a much bigger budget but wasted money on cartoony CGI effects.As a massive fan of the first, this second instalment of this movie has left a sour taste in my mouth.

Frank Martin is every action star rolled into one, and he's damn cool to boot. This film (much like the first) is overdone on purpose as an almost comedic effect. Everything about this movie is epic in the sense of action. Just look at the way he talks...pretty much everything he says is a one liner, or close to it, and he is made out to be the most dangerous man in the world. The only thing that would have been even more epic then this already is was if he was originally an extreme athlete recruited by the government to become a top level spy (and that ones already been made). If you just look at these types of films as more of comedies then action, then you will profoundly enjoy them, and cheer at the fact that you know exactly is coming next.

A little stretching beyond being totally reasonable is allowed - this is the movies after all! Where else but in the movies can humans become ""Supreme"" - and with supreme I mean a perfect model of human achievement which exists somewhere in our subconscious - not outlandish stuff like Superman (no offense to Superman fans). By the way the perfect model I am talking about refers to the state of physical and mental awareness displayed by Jason Statham's character in his action sequences.

The movie started off good but I soon realized that the people who made this sequel took advantage of there fans and wasted 87 Min's of my life and my money.We all know that the great thing about the first transporter movie was that the action the fights and the story was different and great. Yes the fights and action would have only been possible if you had a horse shoe up your rectum but they were still shot with some sort of realism to them. Well that was lost with this sequel. Including a car stunt that didn't even remotely look real where the car does a spin in midair and still manges to land on its wheels and a fight with a woman who seems to hover through her whole fight sequence. The story was good and there was still some great fight sequences as long as they left out the matrix/hidden tiger flying butterfly crap but the several mess ups just totally ruined this movie for me.

342,sherminator1985,Worth watching on a Saturday night!!,10,27 December 2005,"Not knowing what the 2nd instalment was about(as the trailer didn't explain)I thought I'm gonna watch this anyway.After seeing the 1st one on DVD and really enjoyed it,then seeing the trailer for the 2nd in a hotel room on holiday, I was looking very forward to this one(seeing as I ordered it on the hotel room TV straight away).Even tho I didn't watch this in a Cinema or on any kind of DVD it was ""Top-Dog"" Right from the beginning,action packed,fast-paced,outrageous fight sequences,brilliant humour and an excellent script.I'm not gonna say what happens to who and why cause I want you to see that for yourselves,but I do like the idea of one of the villains as a woman who is more than in control and knows what shes doing with her weapons.Jason Statham has finally met his match with her I think.Also after seeing the movie I went out and bought the soundtrack as its is both a mixture of Score and Various Artists,which made the film better.The Main Theme is very good.Then as soon as I got back of Holiday I pre-ordered the DVD on R1 DVD as I can't wait for it to come out on R2 as it will take forever like it usually does.Now that is how good the film really is!! Jason Statham is very good in this film,he hasn't changed abit from the 1st one,but that is how we like him!The only thing Jason may have changed is his fight moves which are even better than the moves he used at the bus station in the first Transporter.So I recommend to everyone that they give this film ago.",Transporter 2
343,cendrizzi,100% over-the-top....hyperbole,3,18 November 2006,"This show represents what's wrong with so many of todays ""action"" shows. It's just painful how bad action shows have become these days. Bad dialogue, laughable stunts (he gets the bomb from the bottom of his car by flipping it in just a way that the bomb gets hooked on a crane), and big explosions (or as the writers refer to them, ""big booms""). It's too bad because Jason Statham has so much potential as a action actor. Too bad more of Hollywood isn't figuring out what the team behind the latest bond film did when they decided to bring the series back into the real world.Nothing says it better than this scene near the end (descriptions added by me but the quotes are directly from the writers script): Our hero enters the plane cabin and boldly says ""Sorry, but the flights been canceled"". Only to give the villain with over sized teeth the opportunity to pull out his gun and counter ""I'm sorry to inform you that you have been canceled"". ROCK ON! Please spare yourself from this film, your brain cells will thank you.",Transporter 2
344,petesake-1,"Utter, utter, utter rubbish",1,13 January 2007,"I don't normally write these kind of comments, but felt compelled to review what I consider to be possibly the worst movie I've ever seen.Don't get me wrong- I LOVE this genre. When I had completed construction of my drastically overhauled 5.1 channel surround sound home theatre system, I wanted a movie containing tons of great noises- explosions, gunfire, fighting, cars, etc... what can I say, I'm a simple guy with simple tastes. So my buddies and I chose this. What a mistake. Now, I can put up with a lot of poetic license. But this movie really was beyond the pale. I don't know who the woman was who played the blonde femme-fatale (and I really don't care)but she was completely miscast. Utterly unbelievable in this role, I doubt she'd be believable in ANY role. I can't begin to list how many times I just plain got angry at this movie- the bullets from a sub-machine gun failing to penetrate a cheap plywood door, the 'removing a bomb from underneath a car with a crane hook' sequence... actually, just trying to list them is irritating. Do yourself a favour- never watch this movie.",Transporter 2
345,luckyman2100,It's really weak,1,6 January 2006,"I give it 1, because this part is really weak. First part of ""Transporter"" is really good. In my opinion French action films are much better than American (of course they have some really good too) and both parts of ""Transporter"" are excellent example. ""Transporter 2"" has to many unbelievable scenes for example: scene when Frank jumps in his car and takes of the bomb or when he jumps in his car on the buildings, because he must escape from the police. I really like action films and scenes with some unbelievable things, but this film is really exaggerated and this is a general thing witch I don't like. This is my arguments why I give it 1. In Poland many people agree with my opinion.",Transporter 2
346,fenwick-1,Gret and Entertaining.,10,17 January 2006,"What is it with people smashing movies because their plots are exaggerated? Is King Kong possible? Jurassic Park? The Matrix? NO! But they are entertaining. This movie, while pretty impossible was very entertaining. Jason Statham does a great job. I love the movie and even went to the local DVD store and took home the display that now proudly houses my DVD collection. With all of the action movies that are pumped out of Hollywood, I was surprised to find a movie that I really enjoyed. This movie has great fight scenes, an amazing chase scene and a level of charm and wit that could only be obtained by Jason Statham. Watch the movie and then watch Snatch and Lock Stock. I'm pulling for a third installment in the Transporter Series.",Transporter 2

348,theguettlers,This is a worth while movie.,9,17 January 2006,"This is a ""guy"" film. Lots of realistic crashes and martial arts.Most of us would love to be able to fight like the ""Transporter"". I found the film entertaining. I would like to give it a 8.5. This website only allows whole numbers for a vote. If your a car crash fan ( for example) ""Herbie the Love Bug"", you will like this movie. I was never bored one second watching this movie. I have yet to seen ""Transporter 1"", but I will after watching this movie. This movie really shows off Miami Florida. I have spent a week in Miami Florida myself, and for those wondering what Miami looks like, this film shows it off well. Violence is big in this movie, but hardly any swearing or nudity.

349,southpaw-18,"Good action, better sequel than most",10,24 January 2006,I don't see what people are talking about the sequel not being any good. This movie was awesome!! Every sequel has a lot to back up after a great opening movie.The writers did a great job to show the abilities of special affects and action with a pretty decent set of actors and storyline.When will there be another Transporter. This type of movie just lets us realize that we can have fun watching movies and not have to soak in every word and scene to understand it.Bottom line. Excitingly different with an expected outcome that was creatively produced!,Transporter 2
350,boswalt,liked without profanity and violence,5,25 January 2006,I enjoyed this movie basically for Jason Statham. I appreciated keeping his character true from the first movie. I appreciate no profanity in this movie esp from Jason's character. The violence and fighting were good for this rated movie. Glad not more expressive. I like knowing that the actors do most of the stunts themselves. The killer lady was a bit much for my liking. The relationship between Frank and the boy was good as an insight into Frank. I enjoy the unique relationship between Frank and the police man from France. I liked the police man's line when he opened the door and asked who are you and he said he was the cook. Carried over from the first movie.,Transporter 2
351,ztest6,Total crap... unrealistic stunts.. horrible script and plot line... AVOID!,4,24 February 2006,"This movie sucked... WAY big let down NOT WORTH $3.99 or even a rental.. wait until it comes out on HBO or is in the 99 cent box at blockbuster...The stunts SUCKED... corny as all hell and no way realistic or even close to believable and anyone who scripts ""where are the reloads"" as dialog during a gun scene should be shot.I am convinced that an autistic 10 year old scripted this movie. SOOO MUCH POTENTIAL! And yet its wasted... This movie sucked so bad don't pay for itYou've been warned",Transporter 2
352,youngfellow,Action hero!,10,11 March 2006,"I've seen a lot of ""action"" movies, and a hellava lot of ""action hero"" movies. They are ALL formulaic, just like ""kitchen sink,"" animations, farce, filme noire, sci-fi, drama -- every cinematic style. The formula is not a detriment - it's the stylistic glue that holds the pieces together. I read a criticism that there were actually scenes that defied physics! Gimme a break! Someone's complaining about one of the essential elements of the ""action"" film! Ever see a Tarentino, Spielberg or Peckenpaw film? My enjoyment is the ""quality of execution"" of these stylistic elements. This action hero expresses just the right amount of invincibility, with a sensitive touch of ""stoic compassion."" Jason Stratham is one of the best, definitely in the same league with Jet Li. I applaud the timing and, of course, the superb editing! Great sound track. And beautiful scene design, to boot! I look forward to the sequel!",Transporter 2
353,nigelbam,"Totally non realistic, but fun to watch.",7,16 March 2006,"This film I feel gives off a lot of energy, it's fast, exciting and humorous. However, I did feel the special effects were a bit cheap and so obvious, the worst being the plane falling out of the sky! The car was totally amazing!! I've never seen a car crash through walls and then not even have so much as a scratch! Perhaps if the makers had a bigger budget, then the scene where the car turns in mid flight and catches the hook that removes the explosive device would have looked more real too. Todays films seem to rely heavily on computerised special effects, This being the case, They need to be spot on! It could be the difference between a box office sell out, or a flop. I enjoyed the film, but found myself saying in a number of places ""yeah right"", as the storyline was good but a little far fetched (poetic licence?), the acting was good, but what spoilt it for me were the special effects. The first ever King Kong movie was as good, if not better.",Transporter 2
