0,TheLittleSongbird,Outstanding,10,2 August 2010,"From Alexander Payne comes an outstanding and impeccably performed film, that is poignant, deeply funny, tragic and truthful, with some consistent moments of wit as well. Sideways also gets my pick as the best film of 2004, and there were a few strong films that year, however it was this film that touched me the most.For one thing, it looks beautiful. The cinematography is stunning and the scenery is wonderfully picturesque. The music is lovely, while the direction is faultless. I also loved how engaging the story was, and how fresh it was as well, while the script is both moving and funny. As far as I could see, there were no pacing problems, it may start slow, but the quality of everything else left me transfixed.The acting is absolutely astonishing. Paul Giamatti is brilliant as Miles, a teacher full of nervous self-loathing, while Thomas Haden Church is excellent as Jack, a deliciously deadpan sort of character who provides the laughs. Miles is the more likable character of the two I agree as you feel genuinely for him, while Virginia Madsen's character is the most likable in the film, and speaking of Virginia Madsen she was delightful in this film.Overall, an outstanding film, nothing wrong with it as far as I could see. 10/10 Bethany Cox",Sideways
1,SnoopyStyle,some great performances,8,15 August 2015,"Miles Raymond (Paul Giamatti) is a struggling writer, a wine enthusiast, divorced English teacher. His best friend fading actor Jack Cole (Thomas Haden Church) is getting married in a week and can't wait to get away on a road trip to the wine country. Jack is having cold feet and looking for a final fling. They meet waitress Maya Randall (Virginia Madsen) and pourer Stephanie (Sandra Oh).Giamatti and Church give two great performances. It's quirky fun with a few hilarious moments. Madsen is utterly charming and endearing. She is such a deep character. The story meanders a bit but that's part of the charm. This is a great character relationship movie.",Sideways
2,Hitchcoc,They Got Me!,9,13 October 2010,"For ninety percent of this film, I couldn't stand either of the major players. One is so self absorbed and pretentious, he made want to throw him out a window. The other has his mind in his pants and while much more likable, is about as vacuous as you can get. So I didn't like it, right? No. I watched it like I was watching a train wreck. These guys got more and more interesting as the film progressed. While I still didn't like them, we could see, especially in Giamatti's case, a person who is heading for redemption. The other has a future full of uncertainty (or is it certainty?) How these guys could be friends is the interesting thing, but they develop a hands off rapport and it seems realistic. There are some wonderfully comic scenes and some real heartbreak. And you know, we've all been there at times. The performances are excellent and once all the hijinks are over, we really buy into these guys.",Sideways
3,Prismark10,On the sauce,8,29 July 2013,"Two middle aged college friends go on a Californian wine country trip. Giamatti's character Miles is trying to get over his divorce, get his book published and is rather depressive.Haden Church's Jack is an actor who might have seen better days and is going to get married soon.Together they go off on their tour and spend some time together chatting, playing golf and drinking wine. Off course Jack has ulterior motives. He wants Miles to snap out of his depression and have some fun whilst looking to have a quick fling for himself before he gets married.Along the way they make friends with two women which might be a catalyst for Miles.There is plenty of talk about wine as a metaphor for life, wonderful photography and scenery, a clever, melancholy and witty script.You feel for Miles as he faces his highs and lows, whilst Jack is more shallow but means well especially for Miles but manages to be a sleazebag at the same time.This is an intelligent and thoughtful movie. The screenplay won an Oscar and rightly so.",Sideways
4,claudio_carvalho,Simple and Delightful Romance,8,15 August 2005,"A week before the marriage of his great friend, the decadent actor Jack (Thomas Haden Church), the bitter frustrated writer divorced oenologist English teacher Miles Raymond (Paul Giamatti) travels with him to the wine country of California to spend a week together. While Miles intends to drink wine and play golf, Jack indeed intends to score and get laid with as many women as possible. While hosted in the Windmill Inn, they meet the waitress Maya (Virginia Madsen) and the attendant Stephanie (Sandra Oh), and they spend some time together, visiting different wine makers and Miles and Maya disclosing their inner secrets and falling in love for each other.""Sideways"" is a very simple, but delightful romance, based on the strong performances of Paul Giamatti, Thomas Haden Church, Virginia Madsen and Sandra Oh. Their characters are very human, complex, with flaws in the personality, but very well developed along approximately two hours. There are drama, romance and comedy in rights doses, and the story is never dull or boring. There are many funny, intelligent and sensitive dialogs, the situations are very believable and fans of wine will certainly love the discussions of oenology. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Sideways  Entre Umas e Outras"" (""Sideways  While Drinking"")",Sideways
5,classicsoncall,"""Man, this is our week to get crazy!""",8,2 May 2012,"At first glance, Miles (Paul Giamatti) is the kind of person I instinctively stay away from. He's got the inescapable snob appeal of a wine connoisseur who tries to impress with his eyeballing of the glass, tipping the wine to examine it's clarity, sniffing for aroma and deducing all the esoteric flavors of a given vintage. But folks, if you're into wine, this doesn't have to be rocket science. On a whim I attended a wine tasting class at my local library, and within an hour was able to duplicate everything you saw Miles do, and it looked like it took him a lifetime to learn it. So that's that side of the equation.On the other side, you've got a guy who'll actually march into the gates of hell to retrieve his buddy's wallet after a night of drunkenness and debauchery. Who would you rather have in a foxhole with you, Miles or Jack (Thomas Haden Church)? I thought about that scene for a while, and outrageous as it was, I bet there's somebody out there who might have experienced something pretty close.""Sideways"" is a somewhat skewed look at what in another era one might have called an alienated life. Miles has hit the point where the rest of the ride is downhill and the brake is starting to wear. He's got all the right intentions, but the results are disappointing. Jack on the other hand is oblivious, with the only thought on his mind is to get laid one more time before he gets laid again. He's pretty reprehensible as a character, so between the two, it's not much of a decision as to where your sympathies lie. Fortunately, Miles gets to figure out at least this small part of his life, once he realizes Maya (Virginia Madsen) is on the shore, casting a preserver to a drowning man.",Sideways
6,gavin6942,"Quaffable, And Not Far From Transcendent",9,6 October 2006,"So many movies out there today use the same old tired clichés or the same plot lines with slight variations. But ""Sideways"" is so different from all past films, it is no wonder this film was widely accepted as having the best script of the year. What could have been a film about ""two buddies on the open road"" is so much more and quite intricate.Paul Giamatti (""Lady in the Water"") and Thomas Hayden Church (TV's ""Wings"") star as an aspiring writer and a washed up actor who are a week away from Church's wedding and hoping to experience some last minute freedom. To Giamatti, that means golfing and wine tasting. For Church, that means hooking up with some eligible ladies.Clearly cheating on your fiancé raises some ethical issues, and those issues are addressed here with a thorough sense of the outcomes that can happen. But we also address the point of view of a man who has not gotten over a past marriage, despite his ex-wife being remarried. The anxiety of not letting go and trying to start over is explored here (in a variety of ways).Two prominent subplots exist: one, the wine theme. Throughout the film, much of the discussion revolves around wines and wine tasting. It is the rug that really ties the room together, if you follow me. And the scriptwriter has done such a magnificent job with this aspect, because although I know nothing of wines or tasting I could really identify with the passion the characters had for this. If a movie existed that laid my passions out so eloquently, perhaps that would be the greatest movie for me ever made. But no such film yet exists, so I must live vicariously through this one.The other main subplot, of the writer trying to get a book accepted was very nice on many levels. We actually care about his book being published, because if it does in fact become accepted than his lies of its success will become truths. And Giamatti is a lovable character in that we feel pity for him. But more so, his quest to rebuild his life is hanging on his ability to be accepted and we feel that being published would allow him to move beyond his past. And within the book itself (which we only hear about vaguely) is a shadow of the man and the movie as a whole, a tragic figure who cannot overcome his own despondency to rise up. And when the character Maya says the end drives her nuts because she wants to know what happened in the ambiguity, we have the perfect foreshadowing because we, too, want to know where Giamatti is going. Will he succeed? Will he kill himself? Or will he just fade away? This film is so beautiful, more beautiful than any glass of pinot noir. All I really wonder, though, is will it get better with age?",Sideways
7,lee_eisenberg,"Maybe one day, I'll do what Miles did with the spit jar...",8,9 June 2005,"In ""Sideways"", novelist Miles Raymond (Paul Giamatti) and his friend Jack (Thomas Haden Church) drive up to California's wine country the weekend before Jack is getting married. Not only are both men middle-aged and single, but they're both oblivious to their own flaws. Once they arrive at their destination, they engage in a weekend of trying as hard as possible to get laid. Most people would have to agree that it seems out of line for Jack to do this when he's about to get married, but he's oblivious. Once the two men meet Maya (Virginia Madsen) and Stephanie (Sandra Oh), all bets are off.Aside from being a great slice-of-life study, ""Sideways"" has some other great parts. You'll love the scene where Miles and Jack have to sneak back into a house where Jack had been having sex the previous night. The people behind this movie were definitely not sideways, and Paul Giamatti really did deserve an Oscar nomination.So is anyone drinking any ----ing Merlot?",Sideways
8,jboothmillard,Sideways,9,17 June 2010,"I knew it was an independent film, and a good cast, and it featuring in the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die book, I wasn't going to miss it, from Oscar and Golden Globe nominated director Alexander Payne (About Schmidt). Basically deadpan television actor Jack Lopate (George of the Jungle's Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Thomas Haden Church) is due to be married in one week, and divorcée and failed writer Miles Raymond (Golden Globe nominated Paul Giamatti) is living a meagre existence as an English teacher. Together, they decide to spend the week together going on a road trip across the Californian wine country to sample, taste and drink the many flavours on offer. While depressed with himself Miles is only interesting in wine and playing golf, Jack is really eager to have a fling before he gets married, since they are both nearing middle age with little to show for it. They do eventually find two women to have some fun and ultimately try to score with, Jack has bar attendant Stephanie (Sandra Oh), and Miles has waitress Maya (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Virginia Madsen). While continuing to explore the vineyards, both Miles and Jack discover themselves and come to some firm conclusions, learning harsh lessons in the social world, but eventually they make it to the wedding and it is a sort of happy ending. Also starring Marylouise Burke as Miles's Mother, Jessica Hecht as Victoria, Missy Doty as Cammi, Lost's M.C. Gainey as Cammi's Husband, Alysia Reiner as Christine Erganian and Shake Tukhmanyan as Mrs. Erganian. Giamatti is magnificent as the self-loathing character, Church adds some flare as the brash former-Casanova, the two female co-stars add a little something to the vintage too. It is a marvellous mix of bitter tasting (in the good way) drama, a sweet shot of romance, and the fantastic swirl of light-hearted but infectious comedy, it's a corker (lol). It won the Oscar for Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year, it won the BAFTA for Best Adapted Screenplay, and it won the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy and Best Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Original Score for Rolfe Kent. Very good!",Sideways
9,BA_Harrison,A full bodied and mature blend with depth.,8,24 November 2006,"A bittersweet comedy about depression, wine tasting, and unfulfillment in life, Sideways is certainly not going to be everyone's 'glass of Pinot', but I found it to be both thought provoking and very funny.Paul Giamatti plays Miles, an divorced unsuccessful writer and wine connoisseur who always sees his glass half empty. Thomas Haden Church plays Miles's best friend Jack, an equally unsuccessful actor who is about to get married, but who wishes to sow his wild oats one final time. Together they spend a debauched week in California's wine region, sampling the plonk and the local women.But when Miles hooks up with waitress Maya (Virginia Madsen) and Jack scores with Stephanie (Sandra Oh), a wine enthusiast with a wild streak, the week becomes more complicated than they had imagined.Whilst both the lead male characters are extremely flawed, they are ultimately very likable, and Giamatti and Haden Church give excellent performances, perfectly capturing the sadness in their roles. Madsen and Oh also give brilliant turns as the women given a hard time by the not-entirely-trustworthy Jack and Miles. Director Alexander Payne's script bristles with funny moments and even though the movie has a 'gentle' pace and a running time of over two hours, it was never boring.Sideways's audience may be limited by its subject matter and lack of blockbuster appeal, but those who make the effort to taste its subtle nuances should find it tickles the palate quite nicely.",Sideways
10,moonspinner55,"Masterful blend of comedic, dramatic and romantic elements...",8,13 May 2007,"Alexander Payne directed and adapted Rex Pickett's book about two former San Diego college chums, a schoolteacher and a TV actor, taking a week off for some rest and relaxation up in California's Santa Barbara County, planning to attend a wine-tasting convention but hooking up with two lovely ladies who have no idea what they're in for. Payne's nimble, easy pace and unfettered style never feels forced or ham-handed; he works lovely magic within this emotionally provocative scenario, and he shows off his four principal actors (Paul Giamatti, Thomas Haden Church, Virginia Madsen, and Sandra Oh) to their best possible advantage. The movie is so subtly good that it runs the risk of being tagged as overrated (the critical raves might not prepare one for Payne's quiet contemplation, which some may interpret as 'slow'); however, it captures empty longing, helpless need, and warmly familiar melancholy better than any character study in recent memory. ***1/2 from ****",Sideways
11,blanche-2,"hilarious, poignant, with brilliant performances",9,24 February 2005,"I found myself chuckling at the beginning of this film, howling with laughter in the middle, and in tears at the end. This is a brilliant work that uses wine as a metaphor to describe its two main characters, Miles, the pinot noir, and Jack, the cabernet. Both men are pathetic, but for different reasons - Miles because he has no life and Jack because he is a total jerk. They set off on a last hurrah for Jack before his wedding - let's just say both have different plans for the week. What unfolds is a reality that everyone can relate to, making it both funny and sad.How wonderful to see the beautiful, luminous Virginia Madsen again. Like many others, I have no understanding - NONE - of how Madsen, Haden Church, the film, the screenplay blah blah blah managed to get nominated, but not the fantastic work of Paul Giamatti - can you spell rip-off? I applaud all the film's nominations as well deserved, but hey, it's missing the most important one. P.S. LOVED the Grapes of Wrath touch in the hotel room!",Sideways
12,Quinoa1984,"Like About Schmidt, Payne's latest film doesn't leave much else happening outside of insightful, brilliant character development, save for some sweet performances",10,13 November 2004,"Sideways is a unique concoction that plays on ideas in the movie-world we know well: the buddy movie, the mid-life crisis, the love interests we know will happen somehow. What makes the film work so much is that it is a mature, refreshing take on what we know for sure (some may see the trailer and think, 'huh, haven't I seen this somewhere before), by realistic in the drama, the comedy, the kinds of emotions we know people like this have. Simply, the story of two early forty-something friends on a week in the supreme place for wine in California, is if anything else at it's best with its character analysis.One crucial thing that Payne gets right is in the casting. Thomas Hayden Church, who I've never really payed attention to career-wise (he's mostly been relegated to supporting roles), doesn't skip a beat in getting into the character Jack, an on-and-off again actor with a need for the opposite sex. Sandra Oh, who had an essential role on TV's Arliss some years back, is far more interesting that I expected. Virgina Madsen is, for lack of another cliché, a breath of fresh air- her portrayal of the heart of the film, waitress, quasi wine expert Maya, helps bring into focus what will come clear, for better or worse, for Miles.Miles, a depressed, would-be-writer-middle school teacher, gives Paul Giamatti a chance at one of his very best performances. After last year's Oscar caliber turn in American Splendor, he never over-plays Miles' down-beat, down-to-earth qualities, and keeps it so that the humor doesn't necessarily have to come from him in the funniest scenes (though his reaction shots sometimes are just classic). I'm not sure if an Academy or whatever kind of predominant movie award group would nominate him or not. But in the end, I really could not see anyone else getting into the mind and attitude of Miles better than Giamatti.Payne, as a director, only has one tiny, likely forgivable liability- unlike About Schmidt, which ran the same exact length as this film, Sideways feels longer than it is. This could be attributed to how much of a story is pumped into one week with these two guys. But the fact that it does focus on so much, and that it doesn't lose interest, is something of major credit. It's a compact kind of movie that works on both intellectual and emotional levels (there's also the score by Rolfe Kent, which is a work of art in its own right), and is engaging in ways other dramedies this year might have lacked. And, by the way, you may want to have some of the vine once you leave the theater. A+",Sideways
13,tavm,Alexander Payne's Sideways was a really good movie!,9,5 August 2013,"After years of hearing or reading about this movie, I finally saw Sideways with my sister who had seen this previously and really enjoyed it. It took me a while to get into but I did and I really enjoyed much of the dialogue and scenes that showed many of the characters' growth throughout the movie. Well, that of Miles and Maya as compared to Jack and Stephanie (well, you can't blame her after what she went through). Before writing this, I looked at the quotes on this page and when I realized I missed some of them because the volume wasn't loud enough (this was at night when other family members were asleep), I really got what my sis was laughing at and so I started doing so myself just reading them! In summary, I highly recommend Alander Payne's Sideways.",Sideways
14,sunwarrior13,An Emotional And Heartfelt Comedy,10,1 October 2012,"Sideways is a comedy-drama that was adapted from Rex Pickett's novel of the same title.The movie follows men in their forties, portrayed by Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church, who take a week-long road trip to Santa Barbara County Wine Country. Virginia Madsen and Sandra Oh co- stars.This movie was written by Jim Taylor and Alexander Payne; and directed by Payne.Miles, who is distressed about his lack of success as a novelist, and Jack, an equally unsuccessful actor with a rapidly approaching wedding. In a last-ditch effort to sow their wild oats, Jack and Miles take off on a final road trip to California's wine country the week prior to Jack's wedding. Both men have goals for the vacation.Miles wants to turn Jack on to the art of wine tasting, while Jack is concerned with exploiting his last days as a bachelor but when the two men come across two fascinating women, the duo is forced to examine their morality, and if maturity isn't such a depressing prospect at least, for one of them.Sideways is the first of Payne's films in which we have the chance to really care for the characters; he reins in his harsh satire better than before.It is a sensitive, to the point of disturbing, expose of love.Love that can blossom with that high school hallway sweetness even in the withered garden of midlife.Also,it is a study of friendship, disappointment and self-deception; and it has at its center the most leisurely of bachelor parties.It's a road movie that stops off at vineyards.Overall,it is an emotional and heartfelt comedy.",Sideways
15,hitchcockthelegend,"If you don't have money at my age, you're not even in the game anymore. You're just a pasture animal waiting for the abattoir.",9,4 August 2012,"Sideways is directed by Alexander Payne who also co-writes the screenplay with Jim Taylor. It stars Paul Giamatti, Thomas Haden Church, Virginia Madsen and Sandra Oh. Music is scored by Rolfe Kent and cinematography by Phedon Papamichael.Jack (Church) is getting married and to celebrate his last throes of freedom his best pal, wine connoisseur Miles (Giamatti), treats him to a week of golf and touring of the Californian vineyards. But Jack has other plans, he wants to sow his wild oats whilst also getting an emotionally closed off Miles to open up after two years of post divorced sadness.Simple yet wonderfully original, Sideways is a human comedy/drama gem. Director Payne and his co-writer Taylor don't deal in gimmicks or trickery to sell their movie, they are concerned about characters, flawed characters that all of us can identify with. There's no need for grand standing, either from the characters or the actors playing them, this is earthy realism coming from an America far removed from the crash bang and wallop multiplex offerings that often coin it in at the box office. All of the four principal characters here are deftly drawn, they are interesting and likable, even when doing, in the case of Jack and Miles, stupid things. They have our attention completely, even tugging away at the heart strings as we find ourselves laughing at the often absurdity of the emotive human condition.This is thoughtful and well observed stuff, boosted considerably by four terrific performances, with Giamatti giving one of the best performances of the year. If you haven't seen it yet then let it in to your life, enjoy, preferably with a fine wine. You will feel all the better for the experience. 9/10",Sideways
16,jotix100,Oenophile,10,28 November 2004,"Finally a film for adults that is totally satisfying. Alexander Payne has to be congratulated for the incredible achievement of directing a film that involves the viewer from beginning to end. As he has already proved with his previous work, Mr. Payne is one of the best creators working in films today.Spoilers herein.The novel by Rex Pickett serves as the basis for the movie. First, we get to meet Miles, the aspiring novelist whose work is rejected by all publishers. His messed up life is reflected in the shabby apartment where he is living, and where we watch him awake in a state of panic because he is late for picking up Jack, his best friend.Miles is a man who has been dealt a bad hand in life. His wife, Victoria has left him and the blow has proved to be more than what he bargained for. His only passion in life is his total love for wine and his trips of discovery in the California wine country. Don't ever offer him Merlot though, he has an aversion to that type of wine. He'll, drink anything else though, but if one wants to keep his friendship, don't invite him to share an inferior wine. The man knows his pinots, chardonnays and cabernets!Jack, his friend, is getting married to an Armenian girl whose parents, evidently, must have made a fortune in L.A. Just look at the mansion they live in: marble everywhere! Jack is going on a week long trip with Miles before he marries Christine. Miles and Jack are as opposite as oil and vinegar! One can't understand what is the attraction. Jack is a man who will run after any female that he feels he can have, while Miles is a shy person who knows his limitations. Miles has a problem with his looks; he knows he is not attractive.Thus begins the trip that will set these friends apart forever, as Miles realizes how shallow and callous Jack really is. Jack never confesses to Stephanie, the woman they meet at a wine tasting, about the upcoming wedding, or Miles, for that matter, never tells Maya, the waitress, either. It's a deception that weighs heavily on Miles because he sees how Stephanie likes Jack. The film has a positive ending after the truth comes out. It's clear that Miles and Jack will never take another trip together in their lives. Miles realizes at the end that Maya has come to her senses when she realizes Miles never intended to lie, or cover up for his friend.Paul Giamatti is perfect as Miles. If he did a tremendous job with his role in ""American Splendor"", in this movie, under the guidance of Mr. Payne, he is amazing. This actor is gifted in the way he approaches acting. Not being a handsome man, he compensates with an unnatural intelligence that guide him to excel in everything. Of course, Mr. Giamatti owes a debt of gratitude to Mr. Payne in having been offered this opportunity to show his range.Thomas Hadden Church is wonderful as Jack. This man is in love with himself; he has a knack in attracting women with his good looks and easy conversation. Mr. Hadden Church gives an magnificent portrayal of a man that doesn't know what he wants. He will live a life of deceit next to Christine and will not see anything wrong in it.Virginia Madsen also makes a splash appearance as Maya. Ms. Madsen has a serene kind of beauty and intelligence in whatever she plays. She offers a complex study of a woman who is trying to escape her boring surroundings and wants to make something out of her life. Sandra Oh, is also exceptional as Stephanie, the oriental beauty that falls for Jack's kind of easy style and looks.Two minor performances also are notable. Marylouise Burke, makes a phenomenal appearance as Miles' mother, living on her own. Jessica Hecht, an excellent actress, who we have seen in several plays in the New York stage, has a luminous moment toward the end of the film as Victoria, Miles' ex wife. There is not a single moment in the film that doesn't ring true. Alexander Payne is a man that shows talent in every new movie he directs. He keeps getting better and better all the time. Mr. Payne is a man that obviously, loves to work with actors, as one sees how well they respond to him.",Sideways
17,dbborroughs,A good but over rated film,5,30 January 2005,"I went to see this film with admittedly impossibly high hopes and walked out wondering what in the world everyone is seeing in this movie.The plot has two friends going wine tasting in the week before one gets married. As the title implies nothing is as expected and everyones life is turned upside down if not...sideways. Its semi-interesting in a semi-clichéd sort of way, but its nothing special.Don't get me wrong its a good film. Its funny, well acted especially by Sandra Oh and Virgina Madsen, however as a whole it left me cold.The problem is that the two guys are not particularly likable. One is a boorish womanizer and the other is a depressed nebish. They are not the sort of people you really want to hang out with, or feel completely sorry for since much of the pain and suffering is of their own doing.I think its over hyped and that those rushing out to the theaters are going to be disappointed. Wait for home video or cable, after the hype has died down. Its advice I should have taken instead of dashing off to the theater.5 or 6 out of 10.",Sideways

19,Boba_Fett1138,Simply a good movie to watch.,8,25 July 2009,"All you need sometimes is just a simple script, some normal everyday characters and situations and then some fine dialog and actors deliverance of it all. ""Sideways"" is film-making in its purest and most simplistic form. The movie doesn't try to be anymore than it really is and it doesn't exaggerate with either its drama, comedy or romance. It's a delicately, fine balanced movie, from a director who started out in the soft-core porn business.Perhaps the movie at the time of its release got a little bit overpraised, also with its award nominations and such but now 6 years later you can watch the movie without all of the hype surrounding it and can conclude that this is simply one fine movie to watch.In search of wine. In search of women. In search of themselves is really the best way to summarize this movie. The main characters are all middle-aged and at a point in their lives when they need to make choices and can start looking back at their lives so far. They all had their disappointments in life but still they also have dreams for the future, though they all realize most of them are in vein probably, since they have already passed 'the halve-way point' in life.It's of course a type of movie that relies also mostly on its actors. The movie was in great luck with it's actors and it stars a fine Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church, who are an unlikely duo, who basically have very little in common and life different lives, with different careers and ideas and are friends just simply because of the fact that they happened to be roommates in college. You believe the characters and their friendship, which also gets tested throughout the movie during multiple occasions.It's a nice road trip movie, that however also stops at times and takes it time to build up things and characters, without being constantly on the move. The movie might not be hilariously funny but it's more the subtle kind of movie that becomes fun and light with the help from its actors, dialog and the approach of the more serious and dramatic aspects of the movie.A great movie in its sort.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Sideways

Like all of Payne's work, this one is smart, sassy and very funny, but also poignant and meaningful.

21,ferguson-6,"If anyone orders Merlot, I'm leaving",9,14 November 2004,"Greetings again from the darkness. Writer/Director Alexander Payne was the creative force behind one of my favorite films from the past couple of years with ""About Schmidt"". With ""Sideways"" he proves his insight into human nature was no fluke, but instead, an amazing gift. He captures many Hollywood stereotypes such as mid-life crisis, groom-to-be cold feet, post-divorce confidence crunch and the overall desire to be loved, or at least liked. What makes Payne's work so unique is his ability to deliver multiple messages, with brilliant comic twists, using little more than unlikeable lead characters and sizzling dialogue! Moral bankruptcy is at a peak in ""Sideways"" as one of our leads (the magnificent Paul Giamatti from ""American Splendor"" and ""Man on the Moon"") steals cash from his mother and the other (Thomas Haden Church from TV's ""Wings"") is on a mission to have his bachelor party last an entire week while claiming we just don't understand his plight. Also delivering a wonderful touch to the film is Sandra Oh (Diane Lane's pregnant buddy in ""Under the Tuscan Sun""). Oh has very unique looks and mannerisms, but is terrific as one of Church's conquests. The soul and spirit of this film belongs to the drastically underrated Virginia Madsen (if you have never seen ""The Hot Spot"", make it priority viewing). Madsen (sister to cult favorite Michael Madsen of ""Kill Bill"" and ""Reservoir Dogs"" fame) literally jumps off the screen with her eyes and smile. Her character wants so much for a better life, but is strong enough to avoid her past mistakes. She is the one we root for. This is an excellent film and nice character study with a snappy jazz score. Payne has proved he should be considered among the best filmmakers of today - now could someone please help his film obtain better distribution!!!",Sideways
22,anaconda-40658,Another Home Run For Alexander Payne.,10,5 November 2015,"Sideways (2004): Dir: Alexander Payne / Cast: Paul Giamatti, Thomas Hayden Church, Virginia Madsen, Sandra Oh, Jessica Hecht: Comedy about parallel lifestyles between two friends. Thomas Hayden Church will be married in a week and wishes to spend his final week of freedom partying with best pal Paul Giamatti. Giamatti is divorced and depressed when he learns that his ex-wife remarried. He waits in hope that his novel will get published. Church is engaged but immortalizes himself in various sexual flings. Director Alexander Payne is one of the best having made two previous masterpieces in Election and About Schmidt. Excellent performances from Giamatti and Church who test wines on their ventures. Giamatti struggles to allow romance to re-enter his life while also trying to maintain order with Church. Church struggles with commitment with only Giamatti to assist when chips are too far down to correct mistakes. Virginia Madsen plays a waitress whom Giamatti struggles to get close too, and Sandra Oh plays her best friend whom becomes Church's love interest unaware that her new beau is engaged. Her reaction to the truth gains worthy consequences. Finally there is the ex-wife whom Giamatti seeks to reconnect with but will have to accept what he cannot change. Contains several funny moments as well as themes of relationships that often spiral life sideways. Score: 10 / 10",Sideways
23,The_Void,Doesn't quite meet the high praise; but certainly not a bad film,8,17 July 2005,"Sideways is a film that has been tailor made to suit the ""intellectual"" side of America's population. Like all Indie films, Sideways provides an intelligent cinema fan an alternative to the wave of big budget blockbusters; but this one is tailored even more specifically to this end of the American market. The film is quirky enough to be funny, but it never allows itself to be out and out hilarious; the two characters are deep enough to be interesting, but the film never goes too deep into their characters to risk getting messy; the plot has more than enough room for the characters to muse, and finally; the subject at the core of the movie, wine tasting, is about as upper, upper class high society as you can get, without making a film where small animals are chased by beagle's and men on horses. All in all, these elements combine to ensure that the film is relaxed enough to appeal to people who want to enjoy a movie and think that they've just seen something profoundly brilliant at the same time. But just like The Station Agent, Lost in Translation, 21 Grams and a whole host of other Indie films before it; Sideways isn't as clever as it seems. Unlike it's fellow films, however; it is good.The film follows two middle-aged men. One is getting married at the end of the week and the other is recently divorced and very depressed about it. The two set off for a week of wine tasting before one of them loses his freedom and, pretty much, get up to allsorts. The film is very well done throughout; benefiting from a well rounded script, some very good acting and fine direction from Hollywood's new golden boy, Alexander Payne. The actors that Payne has selected are typical for this sort of film; they're good, and known to those 'in the know'; but they're not world famous names that would draw in the casual movie fan. Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church take the lead roles and present good portraits of middle-aged men that are dissatisfied with their lives. The two have a good on-screen chemistry, and while they don't come close to the brilliance of some of the truly great on-screen duos; they do serve this film well. Sideways was given a lot of high praise upon release, and not all of this praise holds water upon me seeing the film. I've come to learn that this sort of film will disappoint over the years, however, so I went into this with realistic expectations, and Sideways delivered on them. I wouldn't recommend seeing this with hopes of it being a life-affirming, deep study of two characters, as it isn't. It does work as a slightly funny movie about two people that aren't happy with their lives, however, and if you see the film with that in mind, it won't disappoint.",Sideways
24,zetes,The best film I've seen so far from 2004,10,31 January 2005,"Jonathan Rosenbaum theorized that critics liked Sideways so much is because it was about critics, and that it appealed specifically to them. He's right. I'm sure every critic is someone who wished they could have been a director or screenwriter, but couldn't make it. But I say, so what? The film wouldn't appeal to them if it weren't insightful to the plight of its protagonist. I was expecting Payne to tease and ridicule Paul Giamatti's character throughout the film, because the tastes and skills of an oenophile sound superficially pretentious. For the first time, Payne restrains himself completely in this regard, and just lets the character live. On the other hand, the Thomas Haden Church character is often used for cheap jokes. He's a shameless womanizer who thinks nothing of spinning lies to get laid. However, we've all known people like him. Much like Giamatti in the film, I've only ever been partially disgusted with this type's behavior. In a way, it's fascinating, because I see these skills of manipulation that I don't understand at all. The biggest question of the film is why these two guys are friends at all. They don't seem to have anything in common. But that question enhances the film more than inhibits it. It's one of the things that makes it truly interesting. Sandra Oh (who deserves a better career than she has) and Virginia Madsen are both good, though, in my mind, their characters were never as interesting as Giamatti's and Church's. Church, who was very good on the sitcom Wings (I'd say he's the best thing to come out of that, but Tony Shaloub also got his start there), is very funny. But Giamatti makes the movie. His performance is, in itself, a masterpiece. It's easily the best performance by an actor this year. It's an absolute travesty that he wasn't nominated for an Academy Award. 10/10.",Sideways
25,Sylviastel,Brilliant American Story of Two Men Making A Journey Together!,10,6 April 2008,"The casting is first rate although at the time, the actors Paul Giamati and Thomas Haden Church and the actresses Sandra Oh and Virginia Madsen were barely members of the A-list. This film is quite a feast of fun and at times quite sad. Miles played beautifully by Giamati is a school teacher who aspires to be a published writer. His best friend Jack who is engaged to get married a week from the day that they start a journey is beautifully played by Thomas Haden Church whose best known roles for his sitcom characters on Wings and Ned and Stacey. Virginia Madsen plays the waitress and graduate student, Maya, and divorcée. She makes the role her own. Sandra Oh better known for her role on Grey's Anatomy is too brilliant as Stephanie who falls for Jack. Not everything goes according to their plan, it wouldn't be a great film if it did.",Sideways
26,mm-39,Another midlife crisis movie!,5,9 February 2009,"Another midlife crisis movie! My buddy Tony bought Sideways for me last Christmas. Another Larry David style movie, without the Larry David bite which David does well in his show Curb your enthusiasm. The movie is a 5 out of 10. A few funny spots, and some potential, but the movie becomes impotent like the lead protagonist. The movie is more depressing than funny. However, the makers of Sideways did their home work. The scenes from the Nappa valley are nice and reflect the culture of the area. The details of the characters were well developed. People who make their own problems. Self-absorbed people, who only think about themselves and the results of their behavior is a good theme from the film. Other than that, I would bypass sideways. The movie's title is right. There is no vertical direction here one feels trapped watching this one.",Sideways
27,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Sideways,10,23 February 2005,"(With this movie, I've completed my essential viewing of all the Best Picture Nominees for the 77th Annual Academy Awards, and this review is one the most personal I've written) Wine lovers unite! There isn't, in my recent memory, a show that celebrates wine, vineyards and grapes, like this one does. Scattered throughout as part of the narrative are so many wine terms, vintage bottles, and wine tasting, that the amateur me can find hard to grasp. Fear not though, as this show can still grow on you.We follow the road trip of 2 best buddies Miles and Jack, for a week, down to the Californian vineyards, before Jack's marriage when he gets back. Kinda like an extended bachelor's party, Miles' idea of fun - that being long sessions of male bonding over wine tasting sessions, rounds of golf, and more drinks over night time chill out hours. However, Jack has a different idea of fun - that of having final flings and sowing his wild oats before committing himself to marriage.So while we see clash of ideas and mindsets, their strong friendship enables them to compromise and help each other during the various scenarios they encounter in their road trip. Essentially, this movie is also about relationships - that between the 2 buddies, that between Jack and his ""fling"" Stephanie, who of course he didn't tell that he's getting married once the week is over, and that between Miles and Maya.Which led me to identify with the 2 main male leads. Jack, the once famous soap opera actor, lives his life by his instinct. He goes with his gut and impulse, and enjoys a good time. My friends can probably identify this part of me, the go-getter, the thrill-seeker. However, this can sometimes lead you to sticky situations, and you'll require your best buddies to bail you out of the rut. Many hilarious moments arise from Jack's desperation in getting laid, in getting Miles laid as well, and his deception towards both his wife-to-be, and Stephanie. Unless he's decapitated, he'll never learn his lesson, and would still want to go for the final ""kill"" - the final scene of trouble that he gets into, is one of the best in the movie.Closer friends will probably see me in Miles, the struggling writer, who still harbours feelings for his ex (wife that is). He goes into a frenzy when Jack tells him his ex-wife has already re-married. He is chronically depressed, that he screwed up his own marriage. To make things worse, Jack has invited Miles' ex-wife and new husband to his wedding ceremony, which led to Jack wanting to back out of attending, well, almost, to avoid meeting the couple. Jack's advice to Miles is to move on, and he will help him do so. However, Miles just refuses to accept the fact, and allows depression to slowly creep into all other aspects of his life, severely affecting his confidence and attitude. Until of course, he meets Maya, and starts to seriously think about starting afresh.Despite the slow introduction of about 10 minutes, the show picks up pace once Miles and Jack hit the road. The down-to-earthness characters and dialogue will draw you into the movie, though some in the audience might think that the ending has left them hanging. A word of caution - in my opinion, it's deliberately done so, for YOU to decide what kinda ending YOU would prefer, and that will depend on whether you're a Jack, or a Miles kinda person.Don't let this underdog movie (amongst the other heavyweight Oscar nominees) slip by, go catch it in a theatre near you!",Sideways
28,SimonJack,Comedy and crassness in a mixed bag,5,20 February 2014,"Most viewers seem either to ""love"" this movie, or to ""hate"" it. By 2/20/14, the two camps were close in numbers. Of 810 reviews, 49% (397) were in the first group, and 42% (338), were in the latter. Only 9% (75) were in the middle range of 4 to 7 stars. Such absolute likes and dislikes often cloud our ability to weigh a film for its overall quality. The biggest dividing factor seems to be sexploitation. So, let's set aside the big ""hot point"" to look at all other aspects of this film.There were some funny moments and scenes. But not that many. There were also crude and crass moments that detracted from the humor for me. The script was so-so, and the acting was just OK. Neither one of the male leads had very demanding or exceptional roles. Several reviewers thought Virginia Madsen was exceptional as Maya. Some of the better reviewers I read wondered how she could connect with Miles. I agree with the latter. That relationship seemed very contrived and forced. The friendship between the two male leads – from college days, also seemed far-fetched. The picture in my mind was of an oaf of an athlete befriending a nerd to help him get through school. And, that's OK too, but it was somewhat of a distraction in the movie. A number of reviewers thought Paul Giamatti excelled in his role as Miles. He was OK, but I saw nothing exceptional in his role. One reviewer noted how the movie differed drastically from the book. Had the Miles character been fleshed out to be an alcoholic, as in the book, I think it would have given more depth to the movie, and humor in the pathos. I give this film 5 stars because it is a fairly good portrayal of a couple of ""losers."" But I can't see what would make this movie so exceptional to the critics and many of the reviewers. I already noted the two large groups on either extreme that almost cancel each other out. Yet IMDb's weighted average score is 7.6. One other rating that I watch is the IMDb Metascore. It's based on the reviews of professional movie critics. The Metascore for ""Sideways"" is 94 of 100 (94/100). I can't see how this movie could have such high ratings. At least one erudite reviewer I read noted that the views of critics as a group often vary a great deal from the larger public perception of films. And that happens at times also with the Academy Awards. One example is all we need to affirm such huge disconnects at times. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" of 1994 has been rated the #1 film on the IMDb top 250 list for a long time. It has a 9.3 weighted average IMDb user rating. Yet it didn't receive a single Oscar out of its seven nominations, and its Metascore was 80/100. That's well below the 94/100 Metascore for ""Sideways,"" which earned one Oscar out of four nominations and had a weighted 7.6 rating. There sure seem to be misfires with both of these scores for this film. Perhaps that's because 2004 was a very weak year for quality films (only ""Million Dollar Baby"" excelled – and its Metascore was below ""Sideways"" at 86/100). The year 1994, on the other hand, was a very competitive one for ""Shawshank."" Still, the amount of competition should only affect the Academy Awards – not the viewer assessments or the critics' ratings. If we judge each film on its own merits (we, as viewers; critics as critics, etc.), we should be able to compile a list that will shake out into some sort of a semblance of ranking, 1 through ""X. ""So, I looked at the past 25 years and came up with more than 60 films that were considered excellent by most viewers and by the critics. All of these films scored 7.6 or higher for an IMDb weighted average score, but all had lower Metascores. Some differences were quite large. The list that follows has the very best of those films. Several won many Oscars and several were best pictures for their year. Many rank in the IMDb Top 250 as of this date – 2/20/14. So, compare ""Sideways"" with this list. How many movie buffs can rate ""Sideways,"" better than – or even among these great films of the recent past? Among the very best are these films ranked in the top 250. The Dark Knight"" of 2008 ranks #4, ""Pulp Fiction"" of 1994 is #5, ""Schindler's List"" of 1993 is #7, ""Forrest Gump"" of 1994 is #14, ""Goodfellas"" of 1990 is #16, ""The Usual Suspects"" of 1995 is #23, ""The Silence of the Lambs"" of 1991 is #25, and ""Life is Beautiful"" of 1997 is #30 – even with a low 59/100 Metascore. The three films of ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy rank #9, #11 and #17, with one Best Picture and 17 Oscars between them. Yet all have lower Metascores than ""Sideways.""""Saving Private Ryan"" of 1998 is #35 on the IMDb Top 250 list. ""The Pianist"" of 2002 is #44, ""The Green Mile"" of 1999 is #46, ""Gladiator"" of 2000 is #47, ""Braveheart"" of 1995 is #81, ""L.A. Confidential"" of 1997 is #95, ""Unforgiven"" of 1992 is #109, ""Good Will Hunting"" of 1997 is #141, ""Fargo"" of 1996 is #151, ""A Beautiful Mind"" of 2001 is #172, ""Million Dollar Baby"" of 2004 is #187, ""In the Name of the Father"" of 1993 is #195, ""The King's Speech"" of 2010 is # 199, and ""Slumdog Millionaire"" of 2008 is #235.Let's hope that the critics and movie goers haven't forgotten what excellent movie-making is like. Maybe it was just a fluke that such high marks were given to this mediocre film.",Sideways
29,christopher-underwood,"I find this likeable, amusing and involving",8,16 February 2020,"I find this likeable, amusing and involving and returned to watch it again with feelings of warmth akin to meeting an old friend. Scanning other reviews I see that this is far from a universal view and whilst for many this is a delight, for others it is a tedious bore featuring unlikeable characters. My feelings towards the film have not changed drastically since that earlier theatrical release screening and certainly I still feel there would be another time when I would welcome watching it again. Why I 'like' it so much has to do with the stimulating dialogue, principally and then the believability of the situation and juxtaposition of the characters. Some have suggested that the two are not only 'boring' but that they would never be friends. This seems to suggest a belief in the ridiculous notion that we can only like people exactly the same as ourselves and that 'different' people are almost by definition 'boring' because they behave differently. Clearly it is a stretch to believe the two main protagonists here longed to be with one another for a tour of the Californian wineries, but then we are told (however differently their lives have become) they were school chums and formed a solid bond at that time. One of the main reasons I like the film is that it accepts and understands this concept, even if, as here the inevitable unravelling comes to pass. I find the film 'amusing' and not 'funny' but I think that is because we are presented with a series of ironic or inevitably divisive incidents rather than a series of gags. That the extremely well performed participants in the action convey the essence of the film so well I find myself drawn into this 'reality' despite myself. Like many viewers, I don't like anyone presented here, except perhaps Virginia Masden's character, but then I don't have to sleep with them or go on holiday with them, I can just sit back and enjoy a slice of life that is just that little bit different and therefore, surely, by definition, interesting and involving.",Sideways
30,namashi_1,A Brilliant Film!,10,2 January 2012,"Adapted from Rex Pickett's 2004 novel of the same name, Alexander Payne's 'Sideways' is A Brilliant Film in all respects. It works as an entertainer, it works as a human-story & it also works as a narrative. 'Sideways' Synopsis: Two men reaching middle age with not much to show but disappointment, embark on a week long road trip through California's wine country, just as one is about to take a trip down the aisle.'Sideways' is realistic cinema at it's finest hour. It's a film where the dialogue takes the narrative ahead, not the overtly fantasized action or gore. It's a film where it's characters communicate via soul. Payne & Jim Taylor's Oscar-Winning Screenplay, is wonderful. It delivers a journey that is quite unforgettable. And WINE Friendly, if I may say so. Payne's Direction, on the other-hand, is subtle. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are perfect.Performance-Wise: Paul Giamatti delivers a terrific central performance. Thomas Haden Church, in an Oscar-Nominated Performance, is fantastic. Not only does the actor play his part with flying colors, he also brings the house down with his genius comic-timing. Virginia Madsen is remarkably restrained. Sandra Oh does well. Others lend the required support.On the whole, 'Sideways' is among the best films I've ever seen. Do NOT Miss This Masterstroke!",Sideways
31,StevePulaski,"""Wine is fine, but whiskey's quicker""",10,2 August 2012,"In the wrong hands, Sideways could've been a deadly, directionless comedy of errors, always setting up some joke even if the screenplay wasn't exactly sure how it would employ the punchline. Or worse; the film could've taken lovable actors and stuffed them into a screenplay of landmines and incredulity as far as the eye can see, throwing them into pitfalls and clichés, with little to no development as characters beyond two self-pitying buffoons.Thankfully, Alexander Payne, an actor who has kept a consistent run of great films, takes this material gently and professionally, allowing the film to inhabit close, methodical pacing in order to develop its characters, give them well-deserved on screen time, and provide us with some of the sharpest, most satisfying dialog in a dramedy in recent years. Sideways is alert, rather than inert, and careful rather than crass.We follow along two wine-aficionados as they travel through the Santa Ynez Valley, tasting wine, and having a relaxing weekend before one of them weds his fiancée. Paul Giamatti is Miles Raymond, a dysfunctional, self-loathing cynic, as well as a struggling writer and pessimistic soul who is slogging through his dead-end career as a middle school English teacher. He once had a great wife, but now she is divorced, and is engaged to another man whom Miles has never met.Our other protagonist is Thomas Haden Church's Jack Cole, who sees this weekend less as relaxing escapism and more as one last chance to get some before he puts a ring on it. Jack is a longtime actor, and was Miles' freshman roommate in college. When they hit the road, their first stop is at Miles's favorite restaurant, where Maya (Virginia Madsen), an attractive waitress he has made small talk with before, catches his eye, and Jack eventually encounters Stephanie (Sandra Oh), a friend of Maya's who works at a local winery. The four agree to double date, and this is where Miles hastily discovers Jack's plan to have one final fling with this woman before he marries. He too discovers that Jack becomes sick with delusion, even going as far as to knowing the woman for less than twenty-four hours and propose the idea of opening a winery with the four of them.Despite being a road movie, the film is a surprising study in emotion and kicks in a brilliant portrayal of ones midlife crises and the way someone can casually agree to situations while in denial of their current life. Paul Giamatti is an actor, with a distinct allure and an ability to convey subtleties in a commendable way, whether it is playing an unfulfilled wrestling coach, or a down-on-his-luck writer with a craving for the finest wine. Thomas Haden Church is equally impressive, usually providing lovable banter and frequently bouncing off his co-star's character's mishaps.I was immediately won over by the picture, mainly due to its simplicity, yet its unmistakable amount of depth and intelligence behind it. The characters are flawed and undeniably imperfect, but that's what makes them fun to watch. Their love for wine just fuels the screenplay's wealth of interest and ideas, providing us with some of the most entertaining monologues this side of a comedy-drama. If a film can make me care so much about a topic I couldn't care less about, wine is definitely one of those, than it is obviously doing something right. What could've detoured into truly mundane, vapid dialog is carefully guided down the route of wit and attraction, despite its apparent lack of relativity.Alexander Payne has swung and hit one out of the park, this time, making one of the most enjoyable films I've seen in a blue moon. A film that somewhat restores my faith in modern cinema. Payne's directorial debut was the wickedly smart and ferocious comedy, Election, centering its story around a spry young woman who becomes so determined to win a meaningless school election, she doesn't realize one of her teachers is trying to run her into the ground. The film was filled with cleverly placed lines that brought smiles upon smiles, along with presenting a satire on the absurd idea on how a rationally thinking man can be pushed over the edge by an overambitious brown nose. Sideways is a step in a totally different, yet efficient direction. A captivating drama that truly embraces its simplicity and closely follows its characters, examining their flaws as humans, and showing us some of the most tender sequences that also happen to be bittersweet and poignant. It is a gem of many kinds.Starring: Paul Giamatti, Thomas Haden Church, Virginia Madsen, and Sandra Oh. Directed by: Alexander Payne.",Sideways

Because there are only like two parts that are kinda funny.I'm not going to insult ""Sideways"" though, because I actually enjoyed it quite a bit. It was a good story of human emotions and doubts in life. This is the first time now that I saw all best picture nominations and the winner. For 2004, we had some good ones: The Aviator, Finding Neverland, Million Dollar Baby(The Winner), Ray, and Sideways. I have doubts though on wither or not that Sideways should have even been nominated. While it still is a very decent movie, being nominated for ""Best Picture"", it wasn't that good.I would recommend this for a watch, it's a good one. But don't expect anything too special, it's a little over rated in my opinion. But this is an exceptional acting movie with a good story. You know how I feel about the top 250 really, it's a popularity contest. So, judge for yourself.7/10",Sideways
33,=G=,Nice but nothing to get excited about.,7,6 April 2005,"""Sideways"" is a little comedy-drama about two guys who set out to tour California's wine country and wind up involved with two women. One is a divorced slump shouldered, amorphous teacher/writer and the other a somewhat more handsome struggling actor who is soon to be wed. As the film's story unfolds it delves deep into wine, women, and woes as it develops the pair of screwball characters and their female companions. Although ""Sideways"" can't escape it's low budget indie look, it does very well with what it has to work with avoiding the ever present dramady danger of campy characters diluting the drama or the drama stepping on the comic moments. Even though both characters are generally losers, the film conjures moments of poignancy and comedy leaving the audience with a feel good conclusion. Probably over touted, but masterfully auteured, the film did well in the year it was released garnering many awards, Oscar noms, and plaudits from the public. Worth a look for adult audiences, especially those into independent type films with relatively unknown players. (B)",Sideways
34,blanbrn,A good film of character study with different interactions of compare and contrast.,8,16 July 2016,"If you watch the movies of Alexander Payne you know that they are mostly about life and it's journey involving the road, love, relationships, and trips and it's proves it's a struggle with bumps and curves and with this 2004 effort ""Sideways"" it's the same only it's a little more of a character study with compare and contrast all around it.The story involves two friends Miles(Paul Giamatti)and Jack(Thomas Haden Church)who get together again after many years and they go on a California road trip together much of it thru famed wine country as their is a lot of tasting going on! Really it's a mid-life up and down for both as Miles is a lonely writer who can't get his book published and Jack is about to get married yet he will not give up his playboy type ways as he continues to drown himself in women plenty he even along on the trip has plenty of one night stands with Stephanie(Sandra Oh) a hot sexy single mother.Thru it all both learn about each other and rediscover friendship with respect for life and relationships and most of all they care for one another again.

35,MovieAddict2016,One of the larger disappointments of 2004.,6,26 April 2005,"I'm not going to slam ""Sideways"" like some of the so-called ""trolls"" of this site have (particularly on the message board). I understand the point of this film and I ""get it."" Unfortunately, I found it fairly disappointing for a number of reasons. I'll try to explain my thoughts reasonably without resorting to the hatred some people seem to express for ""Sideways."" First of all, the road-buddy genre is one of my favorites. In fact any sort of character-oriented, introspective-themed film that features a couple of people just talking together, intelligently, I find naturally engaging. This can range from experimental, theatre-esquire motion pictures such as ""Tape"" (which is constrained to a single room for its entire duration and focuses on a triangle of people) to the broader comedies such as Martin Brest's ""Midnight Run"" (1988), starring Robert De Niro and Charles Grodin.So when I heard that ""Sideways"" was coming out, I was enthralled, because its plot described my ideal film -- a road ""comedy"" with bittersweet drama and realistic, flawed characters. I couldn't wait. And when I found out that Alexander Payne was directing it, and it had garnered (at one point in time) 100% positive reviews on RottenTomatoes.com, I was even more excited.On top of that the cast were all fairly unknown -- the underrated character actor Paul Giamatti (our generation's Peter Lorre) being given top billing? Hurray! Because of this I never expected the movie to become the sensation it has become. In particular it seems this film is the rare sort of motion picture that appeals more to adults than it does teenagers. The filmmakers did not resort to toning down the material (language and sexuality, and therefore the flaws of the characters) in an effort to gain a PG-13 and cater to the marketable demographics.As a result this does appeal to a very strict range of people in general -- probably mostly middle-aged white middle-to-upper-class Americans who can relate to the characters of Miles (Giamatti) and Jack (Thomas Hayden Church). This is like an alternate version of ""About Schmidt"" -- a mid-life crisis, set on the road, focusing on the flaws of humans. It's a testament to Payne's skills as a director that he manages to make the material still seem original. This is very different from ""About Schmidt"" and yet eerily concurrent.My disappointment in ""Sideways"" is that it is a great deal less mature and intelligent than I had expected. For an R-rated picture, yes, it remains quite ""rough"" (frequent language, nudity, sexual cantor) -- but not in a good way.My example is the character of Jack. Although I found Church very funny as Jack, and laughed many times at his jokes and blunt attitude, I found the character himself to be cruel and unlikeable for most of the duration. I expected the ending to expose a revelation of some sort, but it never came around. He uses Miles and their friendship to his advantage many times, as well as using women and treating them as sexual objects continuously. I hope I don't sound prudish. It's just that in a film as serious as ""Sideways,"" and a film that relies on characters as its support braces, we need characters we can feel empathy for. Realistic characters. Other films of this genre have weak characters, but at their core they remain empathetic. Not here. At Jack's core, he's a sexually excited jerk with no likable traits. He seems like a fake comical caricature of a real human being. Not very impressive.Likewise, Miles (Gimatti) whines so very much throughout the film that it's hard to feel sorry for him -- he comes across as the self-pitying jerk rather than the shy, troubled, likable character he should have been.Payne is a great director, one of the best out there. (Think of Wes Anderson minus some of the cheap sentimentalism inherent in most of his recent films.) And I loved ""About Schmidt"" not only because it was well made but because I felt sympathy for the Jack Nicholson character. But I did not like ""Election"" for the same reason that I do not like ""Sideways"" too terribly much -- the characters are unlikable. As I earlier compared this to ""Schmidt,"" I must also compare its lesser traits to ""Election,"" not only via the characters but through its use of absurd dark comedy. (Another thing I disliked.) ""Election"" and ""Sideways"" both start out as realistic character studies and become quite over-the-top towards their conclusions. (In ""Sideways,"" the scene in which Miles retrieves Jack's wallet was the solidification of this as far as I am concerned.)Don't get me wrong. I liked ""Sideways."" At two hours, it kept me entertained.But I feel it is being given unfair praise -- it isn't deserving of the critical joy it is receiving. The humor is too broad at times, the characters are unlikeable (occassionally despicable), and the film -- like Miles himself -- wallows in its own self-pity to such an extent that it passes over the important things. I expected some heavy dialogue, some great character-driven moments between the two lead characters, and I got very little. On top of that, Payne seems to be remaking two of his earlier films by mixing them in a blender and adding a few new elements.I would recommend ""Sideways,"" but also say that as someone who loves this particular genre and style of film-making, and hearing so much and expecting to be blown away, I was quite disappointed and, in the end, left a bit cold.3/5.",Sideways
36,sddavis63,What A Downer!,3,17 July 2008,"Yet another in the well-worn (and some would say worn out) motif of the road trip, in which two guys (Miles and Jack, played by Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church) spend the week before Jack's wedding driving around California's wine country. As with all movies of this type, both lead characters are having problems and desperately need to ""find"" themselves. Miles is a divorced, middle school English teacher; a wannabe author and a connoisseur of fine wines. Jack is a mostly out of work actor (except for voice overs on TV commercials) who seems to feel the need to pick up whatever girl he can find as he sows his wild oats before marriage (although it would seem those oats have already been well sown.) I didn't find these characters particularly interesting; neither did I find the attempts at humour scattered throughout very funny (with the exception of the scene in which Miles gets chased out of the house by the naked husband of one of Jack's conquests after sneaking in to reclaim Jack's wallet, which was left behind.) In the end, the strongest part of the movie was the performances. Giamatti and Church were very good, Virginia Madsen as Miles' love interest Maya was both good and quite attractive, while Sandra Oh was decent enough as Stephanie, the unfortunate woman who gets taken for a ride by Jack. The performances couldn't overcome the weaknesses in the story, though, which was essentially dark and unpleasant throughout. The movie tried to end on a hopeful note, with Miles knocking on Maya's door, although what happened when Maya answered (or even if she was home) being left as an open question. Overall, I really didn't enjoy this movie, and find its relatively high rating hard to understand. 3/10",Sideways
37,Buddy-51,a mellow elixir that goes down easy,8,6 October 2005,"Alexander Payne's ""Sideways"" is what is known in the movie business as a ""Little Movie That Could,"" a low budget, independent film without major stars or dazzling special effects that, nevertheless, achieves a measure of success at the box office and, in this case at least, an Oscar nomination for Best Picture of the year.Based on the novel by Rex Pickett, ""Sideways"" tells the story of two middle-aged men, Miles and Jack, who head to the wine country of Central California for one final fling before Jack gets married. Miles is an aspiring writer whose recent failures in life have left him bruised, cynical and deeply depressed. In fact, he feels like a loser on two fronts, both as an author and as a husband, for he has yet to have a single work of his published, and he has recently gotten divorced from a woman whom he obviously still loves deeply and whom he can't quite seem to let go of. The one aspect of life in which Miles really seems to excel and in which his passion is given free rein is his connoisseurship of fine wine. His buddy, Jack, is a has-been TV actor who has spent the last few years doing voice-over work for pharmaceutical commercials. Jack wants his final week as a bachelor to be a non-stop orgy of wine, women and song, but Miles prefers a quiet week of three parts wine tasting to one part self pity.Like a rare, vintage Pinot Noir, ""Sideways"" is a film best appreciated by those with a finely developed taste for the subtle and offbeat. What often happens with a ""small"" film that achieves an unexpectedly wide crossover success is that it tends to suffer a certain critical backlash from people who go into it with soaring expectations and come out wondering what all the fuss is about. The ideal way to experience a film like ""Sideways"" is to allow it to sneak up on you, to let it catch you unawares with its uniqueness and charm. But since none of us can turn back time to that particular moment of nascent discovery, we are forced to watch it through the filter of our own preconceived notions and expectations.All this is preparatory to saying that ""Sideways"" is a very enjoyable little film for those willing to give it a chance. Not only are the premise and the setting novel and unique, but the film boasts some of the finest ensemble acting in any movie of recent years. Paul Giamatti, long one of our most talented and underrated actors, gives a performance of tremendous understatement and restraint, creating an entire character as much through facial expressions and body language as through dialogue. Miles isn't even all that likable at times - he actually steals money from his own mother on her birthday then leaves without saying goodbye - but his lack of self-image, his clear-eyed rationality and his puppy dog vulnerability win us over anyway. As the playboy, Jack, Thomas Hayden Church reveals a layer of sensitivity buried under all that cold-blooded crassness. Playing the two women who enter into their lives that week, Sandra Oh and, especially, Virginia Madsen provide a sweetness and warmth that contrasts nicely with these two emotionally stunted middle-aged ""losers."" In a perfect blending of form and content, Payne and co-author Jim Taylor have created a tasty mixture of revelatory conversation, understated humor and lyrical camera-work. So sit back, uncork a bottle of your favorite vintage and enjoy the aperitif that is ""Sideways.""",Sideways
38,cherold,"okay, I guess",6,25 June 2005,"First off I should be fair and say I was half asleep for the first 20 minutes of this movie, so perhaps that first 20 minutes sets the rest of it up in such a way that it's just not the same movie without it, but as my head cleared and I started watching I was just not enthralled. A jerk and a depressed writer go wine tasting and women wooing. I didn't feel there was much insight into the characters; it shows you what they do but lacks those revelations that make a movie more than just watching guys do stuff. The performances were fine but I do not understand why people were complaining that Giamatti didn't get an Oscar nomination, because I didn't find his performance especially interesting.Watching this movie I kept thinking of Lost in Translation, because that was another movie that everyone raved about that I thought was meandering but sort of watchable. And like Translation, I can't understand why some people say the movie is so funny, because it's just occasionally amusing.",Sideways
39,Robert_duder,Independent doesn't have to mean BAD!!,8,6 March 2005,"Perhaps this year more than any other has been the year to make the average theater goer realize that independent ""artsy"" films don't necessarily have to be crappy or boring. Sideways is one of those films that can prove that. A dark, downright black comedy that can be discussed or just enjoyed.Sideways (a little fuzzy on the meaning of the title) is about two middle aged men, best friends since college, both at a juncture in their life...one getting married, the other starting to gain his independence, go on a road trip across California together and they both learn a lot about themselves and their futures.It's a very simple premise, it's a coming of age story but the age is middle age. Paul Giamatti is Miles Raymond, the depressed, down on his luck, lovable loser type that nothing ever seem to go right for but mostly by his own decisions. Giamatti got robbed of an Oscar Nomination for this role because he's absolutely amazing and really he is the star of the film. The story is about him in essence. Giamatti has always been a great character actor starring in many, many films but this is his best that I've seen him in. He leads the film with tact, morality, depression, anxiety and you just feel sorry for the guy. Thomas Hayden Church plays Jack, the future groom to be enjoying his last week of ""freedom."" He's the kind of guy that everybody knows one of...the jocky, cool fraternity type who never seems to grow up. As hard as he tries he's just never as bright as anyone else. Both roles are played very well by both men. Sideways relies on these two guys, not only relies but Sideways IS these two guys. There is very little else to the film to lean on. The story is set up, carried out, exists through these two men. We aren't watching a movie as much as we are watching these two men go about their week of self discovery. The two supporting actress's do an all right job but they are really only there as very brief plot inducers. The film is long and feels long but outside of that it's interesting, heartbreaking and at times funny.The most amazing part of Sideways is that it is REAL! There is nothing in this film that couldn't happen to anyone else. This is the story of two very average, very real people. You can find a piece of yourself in either one of them. Alexander Payne does an amazing job of not throwing anything else in this film just for the sake of making it watchable. Because you can feel and see everything these guys are going through, you stay tuned. Sideways is not a film that will be instantly gratifying for the average movie goer but for something intelligent and different, you won't be disappointed. A very big 8/10!!",Sideways
40,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Another great film in what's been a week of great films for me,10,26 August 2005,"STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits Miles (Paul Giamatti) is a high-school English teacher suffering a mid-life crisis. He's divorced from a woman he's still passionately in love with after a stupid affair with another woman. He's developing a serious drinking problem. He steals money from his mother. And his epic novel is constantly being rejected by publishers. Disillusioned with life, he heads off on a cross-country trip with his soon-to-be-married best friend Jack (Thomas Haden Church) an out-of-work actor who wants to make the most of his remaining days of bachelorhood. Miles entertains his love of fine wines (when he's not trying to guzzle them!) and Jack entertains his love of loose women-but neither of these men whom life has passed by will be able to ignore the crippling truths that are shattering both of their lives and work on ways of improving them.I've been watching a lot of, shall we say, higher-brow films this past week or so. And it feels great to round it off with Sideways, a delightful comedy that manages to hit all the right buttons.This film works because basically it pulls everything off with aplomb. It's definitely not a film for those looking for action and excitement. It's a thoughtful and contemplative study of what can happen if we don't make the most out of life, leave things too late and don't take advantage of any opportunities that are thrown our way. The length of the film may be an issue to some, but to me, although I got a bit restless in parts, it ultimately just made it all more absorbing and thorough.Another success of the film is it's ability to make you feel a wide range of emotions. It's hysterically funny one minute, desperately sad the next and more gentle and laid-back the next minute. This in turn makes you feel more empathy for the characters as this is very true to life. And of course it helps that the lead actors are very good as well. Giametti portrays a great laid-back, well-spoken but edgy man who has a great rapport with Haden-Church's charismatic, swinging every-man. The supporting cast are very good too but it's the stars of the show that keep the boat flowing.If you're a fan of As Good As It Gets style comedy, or even if you just want to see a great film, Sideways is a very good, recommendable choice. *****",Sideways
41,ElMaruecan82,"Feeling the ""Payne"" again...",10,9 September 2019,"""Sideways"" hit such a sensitive chord that I'm not sure I'll be able to articulate my thoughts in a rational way. I've identified myself to movie characters before but not as promptly and wholeheartedly as I did with Miles, played by Paul Giamatti. Officially, he's a teacher and wine expert (in other words, an oenologist), in reality an insecure, perpetually malcontent alcoholic, only with the right mixture of self-inflicted pathos and witty self-awareness to earn our sympathy, like a good Muscat hiding its sweet and fruity taste under its plain white texture. But this is not just about Miles, Alexander Payne has a unique talent to create characters with texture and densities, which makes it fitting for a film that deals with wine.To make that foolish comparison short, I'm a recently divorced teacher, at 37 exactly the same age Giamatti was when he played Miles, I'm a wannabe writer, I started writing a few short stories wondering whether I'm looking for compliments to play like micro-bits of satisfaction of the true ego-flattering publication. Also I can't still get over the separation and the sight of happy people remind me of how unhappy I am so I keep myself busy to forget about how lonely I am. There's more to it, I've consumed alcohol more than usual recently using it as a social crutch to feign confidence or as a waste dump for my sorrow. Miles seems to use oenology to get cheaply drunk and be fun and outgoing while obviously his friend Jack (Thomas Haden Church) doesn't need it.Miles represent a kind of person who're so embittered by the taste of recent events that they're in a constant quest for occasional pleasures who, combined together, make up for a semblance of happiness, if not stability. Miles is at a point of his life where he knows the higher he climbs the harder he'll fall, so fearing the fall, he doesn't even try and when he does, he anticipates it so strongly he won't even be disappointed. For any prospect of winning, there are higher odds of losing, and that's what a loser is, not someone who fails, but someone who's constantly hiding beneath the spectrum of failure, someone whose aura is overwhelmed by perfectly justifiable failure, those people we label as losers have always good reasons to believe they are.Miles has a best friend, Jack, they were college roommates and Jack is everything he's not, a good-looking womanizer with a strong masculine voice (he does ""warning"" voices in commercial) and to those who believe their friendship is unlikely, I said on the contrary. Men like Jack love budding along with men like Miles whose passive personality work like perfect foils, and people like Miles need someone to give them a boost, to share how let down they are even when they don't expect anything. Jack is also a marginal in a way, he didn't become the star he wanted but he takes life in all stride, and finds in the last week before his marriage an opportunity to loosen up a little, in fact to get laid, for Miles, it's an opportunity to taste wine, in fact to get drunk.""Sideways"" takes off when they go for a road trip into Californian wine country, Miles' character's establishing moment consists of getting late after a hung over morning and stealing money from his benevolent mother, this is a man who had reached so many lows that one won't make a difference. Knowing that something is wrong won't stop him which is what he has in common with Jack who flirts with a young wine pourer Stephanie (Sandra Oh). Miles has more serious feelings for a waitress named Maya (Virginia Madsen), a wine expert not too insensitive to his intellect and finesse of taste, which can pass for charm assets in a guy like Miles. Yet she's also recovering from a divorce and her occasional distance can give the wrong idea to Miles. They both talk passionately and gently about wine, and when Maya seems not ready for a kiss, she still wants to read Miles' draft (meanwhile Jack and Stephanie are having fun).After ""About Schmidt"", Alexander Payne signs another road trip with people with a bad break in their lives and forgiven for two reasons: they're their own victims and they make us laugh.Jack's character adds more layers to the story, putting Miles in situation he tries to avoid instead of crawling in fetal position and whining about his failures. Ironically, this is how Jack gets confronted to his own demons, earning him a fatal blow in the nose, and the bandage he keeps for the rest of the movie (like in ""Chinatown"") plus a last misadventure convinces him about the path he must take for his life. Through action, Jack finds meaning, following his advice to strike the iron while hot, while Miles keeps on waiting for opportunities that never come, the right celebration to open a 1961 'cheval blanc', waiting for the book publication to have a chance with Maya, waiting for this and that and ending with disappointment. This is how spectacular Giammatti was, I could always guess what was going through his head, when his ex announced that she was pregnant, I immediately anticipated his reaction Payne creates such dense and rich characters with personalities that they seem to have a life of their own even outside the film.Church and Madsen would be Oscar-nominated but It's quite an irony that Giamatti wasn't, echoing his own character, but following the lesson of ""Sideways"", he left a performance for ages, a credit to his talent. And ""Sideways"" is a wonderful movie inviting us to stop looking down on losers because it's all a matter of perspective, people succeed and fail, but it's all about the effect you have on the others, taking defeat gracefully can be a victory by itself, just like you can make a flawless dramedy out of flawed people.",Sideways
42,paul2001sw-1,"A sideways glance that sees some things, misses others",7,2 May 2005,"'Sideways' is a black comedy that (with the exception of a few laugh-out loud moments) is more black than comic. The story of two middle-aged failures, one about to commit to a marriage about which he is uncertain, the other still recovering from a painful divorce, 'Sideways' explores a ""stag week"" that the two spend in each others' company. The film is true to life, and rather bitter, because the story of a (self-perceived) failure is necessarily grim. In fact, if one is to criticise this film metaphysically, one might say that its acute awareness of the painfulness and apparent pointlessness of life for the ageing and childless is not balanced by a matching awareness of the futility of life in general: children or none, we must all grow old and die, and our children will surely one day die as well. Even the ""successful"" are often still searching for an elusive state where everything seems in balance, and with purpose. This is not to say that ""failures"" don't have it harder, but it is to say that the difference is primarily one of degree. The sense that Miles, the effective hero, has of his own alienation from society is thus completely human but also exaggerated, in that almost everyone feels alienated to some extent. In other words, to be depressed is simply to be a realist: but most of us manage at least some of the time to delude ourselves into being happy. But instead of softening its blows with this kind of insight, 'Sideways' instead uses a tacked-on happy ending that sits oddly on the preceding material. Overall, 'Sideways' gives us a rather lopsided view of the human condition; that said, it's a sharp look at life from its chosen perspective, and maybe not a film for an unmarried male to watch on the eve of a birthday.",Sideways
43,dromasca,problems of the people who have no problems,7,16 August 2005,"I have a hard time understanding the hype around this film. Really, what is the fuzz about? It's a well acted, easy going story about a couple of friends taking a grown-up bachelors vacation. One of them is on the verge to get married, and is on a rampage to consume his last days before marriage, the other is still not recovered after a failed marriage, and is the virgin soul among the two. They will get involved with a couple of waitresses in California wine country, the one who seems solidly involved will get kicked-off (physically and all), the less involved one will become more involved, etc. The film never decides if it's a comedy, a romantic story, or a TV good-life show. Maybe it's a combination of the three, not a bad one, but this story about the problems of people with no problems is so boring, that the verbose wine production conferences are some of the more exciting lines in the movie. The previous film of the director was 'About Schmidt', on the same line, but at least that one had the fabulous Jack Nicholson acting.Again, not a bad film, professionally made, but minor completely devoid of any interesting story, characters, or subject. The fact that it was a Oscar contender speaks only about a poor year in the American cinema history, but why should we be astonished taking into account that the big winner of the year was 'Aviator'.",Sideways

You get all three with 'Sideways', the wine tasting dram-com led by the always great Paul Giamatti. Though there is plenty of alcohol, I'm glad there isn't too many dumb drunk scenes, but the few they have with Giamatti are hilarious. The movie is truly about a man basically having a mini mid life crisis and trying to forget his ex-wife.The movie does a lot well, the biggest being casting. There isn't a person on the planet that would have been better fit to play Miles than Giamatti. And the chemistry him and Haden-Church have on screen is great. I'm surprised even more Oscar nominations didn't come this way. The script is high and above most films, as it takes turns one would not expect, while at the same time staying true to the characters and tone of the film as a whole. I actually liked the open end to the story, and wonder if that's how the book ends as well.My only complaint being that I didn't particularly feel the chemistry between Virginia Madsen and Giamatti fit that well. Perhaps another actress would have fit that role better but other than that it's a great watch with some surprisingly funny moments.

The acting was OK, but I didn't see anything that makes it outstanding. It does have some funny moments, mainly involving Jack and his women. How could you not laugh when he decides to pick up the porkly waitress. And then when Miles goes back to her house while she and her husband are ""involved"".But since Jack was such a pig, it really makes me not like this that much. I can't hope that someone who wants to cheat on his fiancé right before the wedding finds good times. Nor do I like the fact that Miles agrees to help him cheat and keep his secret. Plus, Miles was a lush who just feels sorry for himself. He lives in misery, not moving on unlike his ex.Also, since I don't know anything about wine, I didn't find that plot part interesting. I really don't care about wine tasting and what makes a good wine.FINAL VERDICT: At least the plot makes sense and isn't filled with holes.

It's a story about maintaining a long friendship and how one deals with life, whether it's positive or negative. I thought this would be a straightforward drama, but it also has some slapstick which pleasantly surprised me.Alexander Payne's film is about two middle-aged men who decides to take a road trip to a series of California wineries. There is Miles who is a depressed man because he is a failed author and a loner who devotes his thoughts to his ex and there is Jack who is a free-swinger, failed actor, and about to walk down the aisle. These mismatched friends are going to have the time of their lives.The acting is really good. Paul Giamatti really made us feel sympathetic for his character despite all his faults. I really enjoyed Thomas Haden Church's Jack. He was really funny and I liked how he trie4s to get Miles out of his depression. Virginia Madsen had some very important lines and that one scene that she and Paul talks about the quality of wine is very powerful and uplifting.Overall, this is a emotional dramedy that has themes on friendship and maintaining relationships. Even though I'm not as old as these characters, I can relate to these guys because some of these events has happened to me in some form or another. This is a sweet film with powerful dialog.

48,A_Different_Drummer,Secrets of the IMDb database...,10,8 November 2013,"Here is a tip. If you find in the IMDb database a film which, superficially, never received any significant praise from mainstream critics, and never received any special accolades from the brain trust in Hollywood, but, oddly, has a HUGE number of personal reviews on the IMDb, then, no question about it, you have found yourself a paradox. How to resolve the paradox? Easy. Trust the IMDb. Real people with real feelings about how the film impacted them. Do not trust Hollywood. Those people have deals to protect and agendas to follow. SIDEWAYS is an excellent example. A wonderful film on its own, captivating, enthralling, a film that drags you into the world of two guys driving through Northern California. There have been ""buddy"" movies and there have been ""road"" movies and there have been ""buddy road"" movies but Sideways seems to set the bar for all three. The script is fine. But the performances are staggering. In reverse order of astonishing we have Madsen, just a tad past her prime, no longer playing the fluffy young things who get eaten by monsters, but more than able to deliver a smouldering glance on demand. Hayden-Church is easily one of the most overlooked actors in Hollywood and, from the interviews I've seen, he knows it. Square-jawed, gravel-voiced, perfect timing -- in an alternate film universe somewhere, this guy is as well known as Tom Cruise. And Giamatti -- hey, has this guy ever given a less than perfect performance? The mere fact you have to think before you answer tells you much about the actor. Years later, in Cinderella Man, he would steal the entire picture from the top-billed actors and STILL not get the Oscar! This is truly great film, a standout in its class, and worthy of the attention that IMDb contributors have given it.",Sideways
49,callanvass,A lovely film from beginning to end; Paul Giamatti is a revelation,9,29 August 2013,"Sideways is a movie I now fully regret putting off for so long. I can see why it has racked up so many awards. Sidways is filled with Wit, perception, and warmth. It's been a long time where I have laughed, felt joy, and felt sad all at the same time. The dialog is very sharply written here, and the chemistry of Paul Giamatti & Thomas Haden Church is stupendously good. Miles is far from a saint. He steals money from his somewhat estranger Mother; he cheated on his ex wife, and he is a rather sullen and negative individual who is a slight drunkard, yet I still managed to empathize with him all the way! He is unsure about the way his life is supposed to go, and I bought every moment of it. It's an amazing performance, and I personally think it was Oscar worthy. Jamie Foxx was absolutely fantastic as Ray Charles in Ray, but I felt Paul Giamatti was just as good. Haden Church shouldn't be as likable as he is, considering how much of a jerk he is, but he is very likable. He's just as vital to the film's success as Paul Giamatti. Virgina Madsen is a delight in her role. She is subtly sexy, and a girl I would go out of my way to date. I loved her! Sandra Oh is good as well. Final Thoughts: Director Alexander Payne has a keen eye for what life is supposed to be about. It's about middle age crisis, and the fear of getting old with no accomplishments to show for it. It was an absolute joy to watch, and left me in a good mood for the rest of the day after I finished watching it. It's funny, perceptive, and completely absorbing. It's very hard to write a review for this film without spoiling so much of the goods. Just enjoy it, that's all I can say. I don't see how anyone could dislike this film. Sidways and Million Dollar Baby are pretty close, so I can't choose as to what my favorite film in 2004 was, but this is certainly up there.

He still mourns his divorce of two years and always seems to be waiting---for his ex-wife to call him, for his agent to say that his novel has sold, for something, anything, to convince him that he is not a loser. In the meantime, he teaches English in a public school and uses his love of wine to justify his overindulgence.Jack is an actor who has been reduced to doing voices in television commercials. He has some celebrity, which he hangs onto dearly, but he is forever trying to prove his desirability.The film follows the pair as they travel from vineyard to vineyard, tasting the wares in the daytime. Along the way, Miles---ever the oenophile---speaks of viticulture and vintages. Surprisingly, his discourses are entertaining, and the film does for wine (except Merlot) what ""Saturday Night Fever"" did for disco.They meet two women (played by Sandra Oh and Virginia Madsen) and things get complicated. The acting of all four leads is understated and authentic. Director Alexander Payne (spouse of Oh) deserves credit for the quirky but comfortable feel of the entire film.

Sideways is a Lost In Translation-like movie that includes a storyline, yet doesn't quite capture the consistent gritty, emotional depth that it was capable of. This mixed film has its high point in the contrast between its lead characters and the fascinating analogies between wine and people, events, and philosophy. Yet, overlooked is the fiancée and any penetrating connection and the aftermath of the indiscretion that occurs in the movie...the hurt, confusion especially of the little girl. The ending is also predictable and stereotypical...The music is gorgeous and well done, the cinematography is handled in the Lost in Translation technique of realism, scripted documentary style of slice of life photography.

52,kenjha,Overrated,7,22 June 2006,"OK movie about a couple of losers who hit the road inexplicably became a big hit with both critics and audiences. The characters played by Giamatti and Church are not very likable. That being the case, one would expect humor to carry the day but the laughs are few and far between. There's a lot of pretentious talk and stale comedy. Giamatti's whiny routine becomes rather tedious and it's impossible to watch Church without thinking of the Lowell character he played in the TV series Wings. It is hard to believe that a babe like Madsen would fall for a schmuck like Giamatti. Overall, it's not a bad movie but certainly not the masterpiece it's made out to be.",Sideways
53,sol-,My brief review of the film,9,25 January 2005,"A very good film simply put, it is full of laughs, pain and sorrow, and yet it still leaves one smiling and feeling satisfied. The script is wonderful: full of wit and it blends comedy and drama well together. The film digs deep and feels authentic too, with excellent acting, especially from Paul Giamatti. The technical side of the film is great too, with a brilliant music score and meaningful editing and photography. The use of wine as a symbol and the idea of reality and maturity and well fitted in. It is a tad tiring and a tad predictable, but very, very good all-round. Deservedly nominated for five Academy Awards including Best Picture, the film did however deserve a Best Actor nomination the most.",Sideways
54,briancham1994,Teen movie for middle aged people,7,26 October 2020,"This film is not quite what I was expecting. It is a simple, low budget comedy-drama that is fuelled only by the strengths of its screenplay and actors. From there it explores the consequences of these characters - one an impulsive risk-taker and the other an alcoholic depressive, both haunted by disappointment in their lives. The interplay between the protagonists and the other characters leads to some far out scenarios that seem idiotic yet relatable in their desire.",Sideways
55,Thanos_Alfie,Wine and Life...,7,26 January 2015,"""Sideways"" is a movie in which we have two best friends who are going on a week long road trip through California's wine country. And in this week plenty of things happen.I liked this movie because it combines really good romance and comedy with drama. If we could divide this movie into pieces I would tell that half of it is romance and the other half is combined between comedy and drama which I believe is a great combination. Another thing that I liked in this movie was the interpretation of Thomas Haden Church who was just hilarious in some moments. Also the interpretation of Paul Giamatti was equally good but from a different angle. In addition to this I have to say that in this movie we have Virginia Madsen who gives an additional beauty on it.Finally I believe that ""Sideways"" is a movie which can teach us many lessons in the whole duration of it and if I had to pick the peak of the film that it would be the end of it. So in order to learn about this end you have to watch and I strongly recommend you to do so.",Sideways
56,johnnyboyz,"The director gets across his love of wine and telling an interesting story but also, rather oddly, his hatred of women.",7,18 April 2008,"Sideways sees two people of oppositional natures spend just a little too much time with one another. Miles (Giamatti) is the shyer, elder but more intelligent half of the twosome whereas Jack (Church) is more egotistical, more outlandish, less educated and the more sexually active half of the group. But then it's true to say that Jack has qualities that do not immediately make themselves known and they are that he is there for Miles when the lure of alcohol creeps in  he is Miles' guardian angel when it comes to drink; his worst enemy, his best friend. So, with these two misfits in mind; we see them travel across California and California's wine country specifically in search of either self enlightenment, the chance to expand or use one's wine knowledge or casual sex.I think the film as a whole has more good things come out of it than bad things but that isn't to say it's a hundred percent squeaky clean. The film really plays like one, long advertisement for the wine industry of America, systematically promoting the drinking of wine, the seeking of casual sex and the mistreatment of women. One thing that backs up this theory is that some DVDs on release (at least the one I saw) came with a £20 wine gift certificate. Watch the film, get the flavour, spend the money. When, nearer the end of the film, a female character is upset and bashes another character's face in when they realise they were not in the relationship for the long term, do we feel much sympathy for the girl? We should, after all she's been lied to and deceived by someone  but the film does not give us time or much of an idea of the character for us to feel sorry for her. She hits him, cries and drives off  cut to the guy holding his nose in a car as they go to hospital, we are supposed to laugh. There are further scenes later on when they try to 'cover up' the injury by feigning a car accident; again, the broken hearted female has almost been completely forgotten making the ambiguous ending when a certain someone returns to a certain somewhere seem a little late and in bad taste.So to give us two characters of such opposition gives the audience a chance to map onto either one. I am no wine expert but Miles' character was for me, the better of the two. Miles comes off as somewhat nervous yet intelligent, almost an Asperger's sufferer in his communication failures and ability to memorise details about wines and information. Then there is the scene when it appears why his wife might've left him and you are challenged to think if he really is that decent, but the film glances over it and it disappears as soon as it enters the fray  I don't know if this is a good thing or not. This is a love story, at its core, just not a particularly good one. When at least one of the two protagonists in a romance is such a lothario, there is always room for genre challenge and I figure this should really be viewed as an out and out comedy  but then again, there's the scene with the face beating. Nobody learns their lesson either, and a waitress is next on the list; this lay results in the loss of a wallet and one of the film's more memorable scenes. Jack may be able to bail Miles out of trouble due to his alcohol problem but it's also vice-versa.Yes, this is a love story but when all four characters are together at once and kissing in an impressive, swooping shot  the camera is more bothered with emphasising us the barrels and barrels of wine stacking up in the warehouse they're all kissing inside of. The first love for this film is wine, no doubt  the character romance exists for use of comedy or highly charged situations that get the protagonists into deep water. Again, I'm not sure if this is a good thing because what scenes there were, worked for me on a certain level. Then there is the extensive dialogue dedicated to wine, not to the women they hang out with; they are a sideshow for this little trip but wine will be around until well after the journey. All the evidence we have to connect with Jack is when he says he feels a special something for Stephanie (Oh) but I feel it is frivolous banter.But you cannot fault Sideways for effort or drive. The film carries that grainy look but I'm not sure it had to since it was a studio produced film with a rather large budget so kudos to the director for sticking with his visual idea and following through. The road trip approach and cause and effect ideas work well when they're not meandering over the relationships and sorting those out. These are perhaps two people looking for a discovery out here; Miles perhaps wants to defeat his personal demons on the trip but taste good wine in the process; Jack is more interested in getting an easy lay before he is married which in itself is questionable  his goal is passed onto Miles resulting in odd turns of events. I think there is enough in Sideways for the average film fan to like and perhaps appreciate but if you feel like having a glass of wine after the screening, you'll have been defeated; likewise, I pray people will not read into the comic mis-adventures of the average womanising alpha male as a lifestyle that looks fun because despite the repercussions over his actions, I do not feel the film demonises the character and their mentality enough.",Sideways
57,filipemanuelneto,"A great film, with a good story and excellent actors.",9,16 July 2020,"This is a good film where we follow the week-long trip that two friends decide to make together. One is an experienced but failed actor on the eve of his wedding; the other is a teacher who aspires to have his books published and has just emerged from a divorce. The friendship is complemented by the common taste for good wines, and the trip could only take them to the wine region of California, where they will live moments of humour, adventure and romance.Skilfully directed by Alexander Payne, the film is good in all aspects but especially in the absolutely delicious and engaging story that it tells us. The strong point is its story and the script really deserves the Oscar it received that year. All the characters were very well thought out and built. Of course, the two protagonists deserve special attention, but the female characters are equally solid and psychologically rich. There is no doubt that watching this film was like tasting a good wine, which opens up more and reveals itself better every moment, both on the palate and the nose.I especially liked the work of Paul Giamatti. He is one of those great actors who does an extremely competent and professional job, with total commitment and dedication, but who has not yet stood out, lacking, in my opinion, the great consecration he deserves. Discreet man, he looks like that kind of person who escapes the limelight and does not want it, and if so, I can even understand him. Here, he was perfect in his character, and he worked very well with Thomas Haden Church, who has a funny character, to whom the script reserves a good part of its comic aspect. Virginia Madsen and Sandra Oh are also very good and do an exceptional job. Sandra Oh surprised me particularly, since I only knew her from a few TV series.Technically, the film is very discreet and relies more on the work of the actors and on the extraordinary dialogues they are having. Personally, I would highlight the competent and very well done cinematography, with a good use of the vineyard landscapes, the effective but forgettable soundtrack and the good sets where everything is unfolding.",Sideways
58,insomniac_rod,"""Sideways"" is like a delightful evening or dinner with the finest wine and exquisite menu.",10,6 January 2008,"When I think about this movie the first phrase that comes to my mind is ""a satisfactory visual experience"". The movie is a delightful tale of two opposite poles in aspect but very similar on their behavior. Miles and Jack are best friends since 1st. year of college and they have went through many things but things are going to change for real when Jack marries. That's why both decide to spend a week together traveling with the sole and delightful purpose of tasting wines and eating from the best menus. Miles is a wine taster expert while Jack well, only likes to drink it.Jack's intentions are to ""party"" all the time before he gets engaged for the rest of his life. Party for him means sleeping with any woman on his way and drinking excessively. Miles, on the other hand is extremely depressed even after one year of his painful divorce and you can feel his pain. Nevertheless, they spend unforgettable moments that re-affirm their strong friendship.Both are very selfish and narcissist to the point that they think that the world only twirls around them. Miles believes that his ex-wife will return with him and he's obsessed with the idea that she may have been with other man. Jack only thinks about what is good for him but never cares for Miles' feelings or even worse, about his soon to be wife.That's the perfect combination of two lead male characters. The chemistry between both is excellent and you wish you could spend an evening eating and drinking with them. Miles is a really interesting man as he's very smart and has plenty of culture about pretty much everything while Jack is very groovy to hang out with.But their trip couldn't be more perfect. They hang out with Maya and Stephanie, two beautiful and charming waitress who quickly become their love interests. Jack and Stephanie make an instant ""click"" and fall in love to the point that Jack considers to change the wedding date. He may be getting cold feet or falling deeply in love with Stephanie.After a series of events, Stephanie finds out about Jack's marriage and leaves him and beating the crap out of him. Miles on the other side gets really depressed after knowing that his ex-wife got married again and will assist to Jack's wedding.Even worse, they have to fake an accident and invent more lies. The day of the wedding things come to perfection except when Miles knows that his ex-wife is pregnant. That hurts him so badly to the point that he's devastated and decides to drink alone in a fast-food restaurant his most precious wine from 1961.Overall, this is a PERFECT movie that could be considered as a lesson of life and makes you really care about the characters. The cast is excellent and you can see their unique chemistry between them. The dialogs are exquisite and quickly grab your attention.The direction is simply perfect and makes this movie look fresh, alive, and truly atmospheric. When a movie is composed 90% of dialogs, you expect a tedious direction but ""Sideways"" proves it wrong. It's a magnificent movie with a fresh direction.The soundtrack is also perfect and fits with the movie's tone.I truly recommend this movie for anyone who likes dramatic-romantic-comedies with an edge. This movie will also teach you in some aspects of a life less than ordinary.Paul Giamatti ... Miles Thomas Haden Church ... Jack Virginia Madsen ... Maya Sandra Oh",Sideways

60,southdavid,Corking,7,30 September 2019,"Another film revisited to try and earn myself the 2005 ""Oscar"" badge. I have only ever seen ""Sideways"" once, a version edited for a plane journey, which might help to explain why I was a little underwhelmed with it when I saw it then. I enjoyed it a lot more this time.Two middle aged college roommates, Miles (Paul Giamatti) a divorced and frustrated author; and Jack (Thomas Hayden Church) an actor whose career is on a downturn, reconnect to go on a wine and golf holiday ahead of Jack's impending marriage. Looking for one last connection before settling down, Jack charms his way into the bed of Stephanie (Sandra Oh) leaving Miles with Maya, (Virgina Madsen) a waitress with whom he has a lot in common, but Miles' dwindling hopes of reconciling with his wife and his generally negative attitude seem likely to sabotage his chance of happiness.I liked ""Sideways"" a lot. Its four central performances, from four actors who were a lot less well known than they are now, are excellent. If anything writer/director Alexander Payne was the attraction, coming of the critically acclaimed ""Election"" and ""About Schmidt"". The film is well shot, and takes advantage of some of the beautiful countryside in that part of the States.""Sideways"" is another smart, witty, observational comedy, of the type that has always been warmly received by the academy. Despite the odd broad comedic moment, its mostly subtle and relatable stuff, as often about frustration, sadness and regret as anything else. Admittedly, the relatively thin plot means it's not one that I'm likely to revisit very often - and can see that being a reason that other people don't enjoy the film at all, as is demonstrated by some of the other reviews.",Sideways
61,Vartiainen,"Very good characterization, unlikable characters",6,26 October 2015,"Sideways tells about a week-long trip through the California wine country, embarked upon by two middle-aged Hollywood failures, both of them are starting to feel the burn of not having accomplished all that much. But, seeing as one of them is about to get married, it seems reasonable to take a trip in order to unwind a little bit, put their worries to the side.What this movie gets absolutely right is the character development. We get to know these two dudes, we really do. We get so into their heads that we really should start paying down payments for living space. Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church are both fantastic, criminally unappreciated actors. Especially Giamatti, who gives us a wonderful performance as a failed author who has managed to struggled through life so far with the help of his more successful friends and the one single skill he has truly mastered: wine tasting. And wine really is one of the central themes of this film. So much so that this movie actually affected real life wine sales throughout the world. That's how opinionated and passionate this movie is about wine.Virginia Madsen and Sandra Oh also do a good job as the two main side characters. The movie is also shot well, paced well, told well and is an all-around great film, a true culture experience. The only problem is that I hate the two main characters. They're very good characters, but they're horrible human beings. And I simply don't like a movie where I cannot sympathize with the main characters. And I know that technically that doesn't make this a bad film, but I just cannot help it. Church's character is a smug jerk, who really shouldn't be allowed to meet women. His acting is also completely overshadowed by Giamatti's, though he is talented in his own right. Whereas Giamatti's character is an unlikable, unmotivated loser.I also don't like how Hollywood they are. One is a failed author and the other is a washed-out actor. I know that's the stereotype, and usually I don't have a problem with, say, the fact that all of Stephen King's characters are writers as well, but here, for some reason, it bothers me. The movie is so good at character development, so down to earth, so very good at telling about the human condition, that the only crinkle it has is the fact that it tells about people who have no common ground with the average moviegoer.Nevertheless, Sideways is a good humoristic drama film. It has great, though unlikable characters, fantastic character development, good dialogues, interesting locale and a pretty neat plot as well. Personally I have problems with its message, but that shouldn't keep you from seeing it.",Sideways
62,billcr12,Funny Movie,8,11 September 2012,"I usually detest romantic comedies, as they can be predicted easily, within the first five minutes. Sideways works, in large part, because the main character, Miles Raymond, is played by Paul Giamatti, and he looks like a regular guy, unlike someone such as George Clooney, who will never convince anyone that he has dating issues. Giamatti first caught my attention in Private Parts, screaming, WNNNNNBC at Howard Stern as he berates the radio host at his new job in New York. Here, he is an aspiring writer who makes a living as a middle school English teacher. Mile takes his best friend, Jack(Thomas Haden Church), on a road trip to wine country in California. Jack is about to get married, and he is looking for one last sexual adventure before his wedding. They meet Maya(Virginia Madsen) and Stephanie(Sandra Oh) at a restaurant, and they hook up. Of course, it eventually slips out that Jack has a fiancé. Trouble with a capital T is the result as Sideways becomes a battle of the sexes, with a solid script and four actors working well together. One drawback is the length of the movie, which, at over two hours, could have been cut down a little. Still,, kudos to writer-director Alexander Payne for his work.",Sideways

Thus, the pace is never kaleidoscopic or fast - it should not always be so, of course - but then you have to thinks all aspects through to prevent the viewers from occasional yawning. Is spite of all leading performances - Paul Giamatti as Miles Raymond, Thomas Haden Church as Jack Cole, Virginia Madsen as Maya Randall, Sandra Oh as Stephanie - being great and the existence of witty and funny moments, this constant focusing on wines and wineries did not please be so much; although I drink wines from time to time, I am not much into ""wine art"" with its over-sophistication.

64,dfranzen70,"Poignant, with a slight bouquet of yummy",7,24 May 2005,"Sideways is a pretty, poignant, genial tale of two longtime college buddies who embark on a week long tour of wineries and golfing before one of them (Thomas Haden Church) succumbs to the shackles of marriage.Whatever your taste in buddy movies is, you'll probably find something you like in Sideways, which mixes the effete elitism of wine-lovers with the frat-boy antics of philanderers in wickedly seamless fashion.Miles (Paul Giamatti) wants to give Jack (Church) a good send off before he joins his betrothed in holy matrimony at the end of the week. Miles, an avid - some would say sneeringly snotty - oenophile, comes up with the nifty idea of the two of them driving up the coast of California touring various wineries and vineyards and such. That way Miles can show off his knowledge and Jack can have a one last good, free time.One small problem. Although Miles is perfectly content to wine and whine for the week, Jack's eye wanders - and soon he's setting up a double dinner date with a winery employee (Sandra Oh) and a waitress (Virginia Madsen). Suddenly the trip's not about the two friends bonding one last time, it's more about Jack sowing his wild oats (figuratively, hopefully) while he still can. This change in plans leads to awkward, funny, and funny-awkward moments; meanwhile, poor Miles - recovering from a divorce (and finding out secondhand that his ex-wife has just remarried) and waiting to hear if his latest literary opus will be accepted for publication - is a walking rubber band ball of neuroses and nerves. He tries to maintain the trip's focus, while Jack just tries to have a little fun.As with most buddy films, Things That Go Wrong tend to snowball into something far greater, and on one level Sideways is a typical road trip movie, including assumptions, lies, illogical decisions, red herrings, and so forth - all in the name of low comedy. But on another level, the movie is an honest look at love and relationships from the perspective of a single, closing-in-on-middle-age male.Even though Giamatti and Church were hardly unknown actors before Sideways, this is truly the breakthrough film for each. Giamatti, a veteran character actor perhaps best known for his role as Pig Vomit in the screen version of Howard Stern's Private Parts, is perfectly in his element as the self-obsessed, nervous, sincere Miles. It's a performance to which many people can instantly relate; Miles is not handsome, he's not smooth, he's not really all that charming, but somehow he's still appealing. He's a good guy who tries to do well and sometimes suffers the whims of Lady Luck. Church is known for two TV series he was in, ""Wings"" and ""Ned & Stacey,"" and I can't recall his ever being classified as a good actor, just an entertaining one. But he's wonderful as the rowdy, randy, perpetually horny Jack; he seems to give the role an extra layer of depth. You can't just write Jack off as a selfish bastard, just as you can't just write Miles off as a dork.Director Alexander Payne, who made the clever Election, does a fantastic job at transforming what's really a two-character study (everyone else, including the two female leads, is background to the relationship between Miles and Jack) into a realistic, fully textured movie. Payne's screenplay doesn't dwell on caricatures and doesn't offer pat explanations or resolutions. Sometimes, the film tells us, things don't end up good or bad. They just continue on.Although Giamatti and Church are at center stage, Oh and Madsen are both fantastic, although perhaps slightly underused. In particular, Madsen (who earned an Oscar nomination, as did Church), makes the most of her brief screen time, oozing intelligence, wit, charm, and sexuality from every pore.Sideways doesn't move too slowly and isn't too talky, and because wine is one theme, there are plenty of beautifully photographed scenes of the lovely Napa Valley's vineyards. Sideways is thoughtful, entertaining, and fascinating.",Sideways

One guy wants to drink, the other guy wants to party. But the premise of the story is not what makes this movie so enjoyable. It's the actors and actresses that make this movie happen.

66,meeza,The Sideway House Rules!,10,22 December 2004,"I am going to be straight with you! I will not steer you sideways, or maybe I will. What I want to say is that Alexander Payne's ""Sideways"" is an elite soon-to-be-classic film that not too many other films will parallel its ""sideways"" composition. The film stars Paul Giamatti as Miles, a cranky middle school teacher who also moonlights as a struggling writer. Miles is a wine connoisseur who inhabits an impressive wine intellect; he should really be teaching a university course entitled ""Wine Appreciation 101"" which by the way is the only college class that would motivate me to complete my homework assignments and attend winery field excursions (otherwise know as going to your local bar and get shitfaced on wine). Miles is also a relentless complainer who should also be teaching another whine studies course entitled ""Whine Repetition 101"". We move on to the free-spirit side of ""Sideways"" which leads us sideways to Jack, Miles' best friend. He is an abortive television commercial actor who is enjoying his last days of bachelorhood before his upcoming wedding. The premise of ""Sideways"" is Jack & Miles' bachelor merriment road trip through the Santa Barbara vineyards (or in other words, Miles wants to take Jack miles away from his fiancée to live it up and get laid before the final wedding bell rings.) This is where ""Sideways"" takes off to cinematic supremacy! On their voyage, Jack & Miles couple up with a couple of wine loving gals: Maya (Virginia Madsen) and Stephanie (Sandra Oh). Jack ends up ""corkscrewing"" the hell out of Stephanie while Maya displays gentle affection for Miles. Maya has a memorable scene where she compares wine's richness to Miles' inner being; so much so that it makes him ""blush"". Director Alexander Payne has proved once again why numerous actors under the ""Alexander the Great"" regime dish out their finest work. Giamatti, who was snubbed of an Oscar nomination last year for his splendid work in ""American Splendor"", is miles ahead of the pack for the best male acting performance in film this year. Thomas Haden Church (most notable from TV's ""Wings"") flies high as the sex-crazed Jack. I will pray in church that Church's work will be recognized with a supporting actor nod. Virginia Madsen was a sweet as a chilled wine with her appealing charm and deserves to be nominated also. And oh! I almost forgot Sandra Oh! This oriental actress made me say ""Oh! Yea!"" (y eso no es un cuento chino). Let me not forget the maestro of ""Sideways""! It would ""payne"" me if Alexander Payne does not receive Oscar nominations for his near-perfect direction & screenplay. ""Sideways"" is a film about real life & people with insecurities! Which is what life is really all about sometimes! It is also a love letter to wine! So take the right of way and head ""Sideways"". ***** Excellent",Sideways
67,Chris_Docker,Genre-defying movie that is strangely heart-warming,8,31 January 2005,"It's pleasantly refreshing to find an American movie that doesn't fit neatly into a box. It's a road movie that lacks the predictable banality of road movies, a comedy that relies largely on the complex nature of the characters' individuality more than funny one-liners or situational gags, and a touching romance that keeps us genuinely guessing where, if anywhere, the true feelings of the main players do exist.Add to this the fact that the two f*cked up mid-life crisis principal players of the film are less-than-decent types that you don't immediately empathise with, and you have to ask, why is this movie so likable? And likable it is. I would defy anyone over 15 - the minimum age to see this film in the UK, not to enjoy it in some way, to be quite entertained for a subtle two hours, and maybe learn something about wine and human relationships in the process - or at the very least feel gently affected and coming out of the cinema feeling a little bit wiser and kinder.Miles, a clinically depressed divorcée schoolteacher and would-be writer played by Paul Giamatti, and Jack (Thomas Haden Church), a small-time actor still trading on his good looks and aiming at nothing more than successful superficiality, are buddies from their school days. Instead of a stag night before Jack's wedding, the two of them go off into the countryside for a week together, with Jack intent on some last minute womanising and Miles firmly focused on the more delicate pleasures of savouring wines of the region in a grape-producing area of California.They meet Maya, a divorced waitress who shares Miles' passion for wine, and Stephanie, a fiery and extrovert wine-pourer. Although there is the occasional burst of outrageously funny slapstick, the real joy of Sideways is watching multifaceted layers of personality being peeled away and even discovering that we ourselves are perhaps a bit more forgiving than we might have believed. It features a powerful supporting performance by Virginia Madsen, who successfully portrays that essentially feminine virtue of seeing the potential for good in someone that on the surface a hopeless case, excellent acting in the main roles combined with superb casting - the part of Miles could well have been written especially for Paul Giamatti, an unobtrusive but delightful soundtrack, and an excellent adapted screenplay that makes us not only believe in the characters but feel they probably represent a large number of middle-class, dysfunctional-but- coping, Americans.Sideways is a joy to watch and I recommend it strongly.",Sideways
68,estebangonzalez10,Payne's best film,9,23 June 2015,"""Only somebody who really takes the time to understand Pinot's potential can then coax it into its fullest expression. Then, I mean, oh its flavors, they're just the most haunting and brilliant and thrilling and subtle and... ancient on the planet.""And thanks to that emotional speech that Paul Giamatti's character gives to Virginia Madsen's Maya explaining why he is so passionate about Pinot Noir, the sales for that wine actually rose by more than 20% compared to the past year. The characters in this film are fascinating, but it was the wine that took the center stage and became a metaphor for the entire film. I'm not an expert in wines, but we all know that the older a wine the better its taste. Ironically however, the two lead characters in this film played by Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church, are reaching middle age without feeling as if they've accomplished anything. In Church's case especially it seems that his best years as a successful actor are way behind him. The two are anticipating their week long road trip together through California's wine country before Church's character gets married. The two seem not to really like the way their lives have turned out, Giamatti plays a depressed writer who has to settle as an English teacher while Church is eagerly looking forward to the week long escape where he can finally enjoy his freedom before having to settle into the constraints of a married life. During their road trip Church begins having a fling with Sandra Oh's Stephanie, while Giamatti finds a lot of things in common with Stephanie's friend, Maya. Is it too late for the pair to find love or like wine are the best years of their lives still ahead of them? Alexander Payne's direction is solid, but it's his painfully funny screenplay that takes all the credit for the film's success. Sideways is one of my favorite road trip movies, and definitely my favorite from Alexander Payne (Nebraska closely behind it). A well written script also results in fantastic performances and Thomas Haden Church has never been better. The same could be said for Virgina Madsen who also received an Oscar nomination for her supporting performance. Sideways couldn't have worked however if it wasn't for Paul Giamatti's portrayal of this depressed, but sincere character. Sideways is perhaps one of Payne's best character studies and that is why I enjoy it so much. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",Sideways
69,smatysia,"Very low-key comedy, sweet despite characters",7,21 June 2005,"The comedy here is fairly low-key, wry rather than laugh-out-loud. A lot of it is pretty amusing, though. The overall tone ended up being rather sweet, despite the appalling behavior of the main characters. Miles, (Paul Giametti) is basically pathetic, never more so than when he steals money from his elderly mother, and Jack (Thomas Haden Church) who is a serial cheater on his fiancée. These two fortysomethings take the wine trip as an expression of their mid-life crises. Giametti, with whom I was unfamiliar, did an excellent job with his character. Church, who was known previously as the idiot mechanic from ""Wings"" shows that he is a real actor, and can do other stuff well. Sandra Oh was quite good as the wild-child local, and Virginia Madsen does some her best work here. She is so beautiful here, also, at least as much so as when she was twenty years younger. (Of course, I might not think that if I were twenty) It's a pretty good movie, not least in that it has some measure of originality to it. It's worth seeing, but I do think more was made of it than it necessarily deserved. Perhaps that has to do with the quality of the rest of the dreck coming out of Hollywood these days, when hardly anyone can think of something to make besides adapting old comic books and schlocky TV series.",Sideways
70,jimbo-53-186511,Despite all its pretensions this is nothing more than a self-indulgent road movie,2,25 May 2016,"Miles (Paul Giamatti) decides to take his friend Jack (Thomas Haden Church) on a week long road trip through California prior to Jack's wedding. The idea of this trip is for the two men to relax and enjoy themselves and for Miles to show Jack the more 'cultural' side of wine-drinking. However, Jack is a bit of a philanderer whereas Miles is much more reserved and is still pining after his wife who left him a few years ago. When Miles and Jack meet two women Stephanie (Sandra Oh) and Maya (Virginia Madsen) this causes all sorts of problems for the two men and ends up really testing their friendship.I remember watching Nebraska about 18 months ago (which is another Alexander Payne road trip movie) and being completely blown away by it. Given that this was another 'road trip movie' by the same director I was really hoping for another enjoyable road trip movie, but I just didn't get the same feeling after watching Sideways and actually ended up hating this film.In Payne's other films such as Nebraska and About Schmidt he's always given us characters that we can care about and characters that seem to have more than one dimension. Whilst Giamatti's character is perhaps a tad better developed than Church's I still felt that neither character were given enough depth to make me actually give a damn about what happened to them. It seems that Payne has got bogged down with self-indulgence here at the expense of making the characters or the story interesting. To me, the whole film reeked of pretentiousness - the idea of the two men sitting down and critiquing wine like a pair of Jilly Goolden's only to then go out on self-indulgent rampages was uncomfortable to watch and the two concepts never seemed to gel particularly well together.Due to the fact I was given no reason to care for the story or the characters it did mean that Sideways, for me, was a hard slog to get through. Sitting down for 2 hours watching people drinking wine, talking nonsense, then getting into inane arguments at various intervals is not my idea of entertainment. I just couldn't get into this film and as mentioned it isn't helped by the fact that so many of the characters are unlikeable.The only thing this film has going for it are the performances from the main cast which were all excellent. The production values were also excellent. In fact, everything was good apart from the actual story.If this is the first Alexander Payne film that you've seen then all I'll say is please don't right the guy off as he has made other good road trip films. My advice would be to check out About Schmidt or Nebraska which are both miles better than Sideways which as far as I'm concerned is nothing more than self-indulgent nonsense.",Sideways
71,davispittman,"Virginia and Paul are great, but the rest isn't.....",5,8 April 2017,"OK so Sideways is kind of a complex film. I look at this movie in two parts. And that's how I'm going to review it. It stars Thomas Haden church, Paul Giamatti, Virginia Madsen, and Sandra Oh. The movie basically is centered around Paul and church's road trip before church gets married. They meet two woman (Madsen and Oh) and these women get close to each of the men (Madsen with giamatti) and (Oh with Church). The chemistry between Madsen and Giamatti is very good and since they are both such good actors it is very believable. The two parts are those two relationships that go on in the film. I got pretty frustrated with Thomas Haden church's character, simply put, he's just a two timing jerk, a complete loser. Haden Church isn't a bad actor at all, and his isn't bad, I wouldn't say it's Oscar worthy, but personally I just really despised the character he played. He was just so damn annoying. I like Madsen and Giamatti's characters though, I liked their part of the movie, but that's the ONLY part I liked. I didn't like any other part of the movie, if the whole movie only focused on that, then I most likely would have loved it. But it didn't. And that's why I'm giving the film a 5, I honestly wanted to eliminate Thomas Haden Church from the film altogether. This is considered a comedy-drama film but there was no actual comedy in my opinion, I didn't even chuckle once at the ""funny/comedic"" moments. Some of the dramatic stuff worked though. 5/10 overall.",Sideways

Which they return their interest. But Miles has tough time with Jack, since he's cheating around before he's getting married and their week together isn't as well planned as he thought it was. While Miles tries to have an relationship with Maya, who's return his affections.Directed by Alexander Payne (About Schmidt, Citizen Ruth, Election) made an excellent, laughter-filled dramatic comedy with superb performances by the cast. Church and Madsen were Oscar nominated for their roles. Director Payne was also nominated for an Oscar for Best Director. It was also nominated for Best Picture. This is an intelligent comedy for the adults.

73,slokes,Comedy So Real It Hurts,10,6 July 2005,"""Sideways"" came out of nowhere in 2004, a critically-acclaimed art house comedy that, from word of mouth rather than a big marketing blitz, hit with mainstream audiences despite its marathon swearing, adult situations, and esoteric information on the art of wine making. Even when the public has the ability to ignore very good films, greatness has a way of calling attention to itself.Miles Raymond (Paul Giamatti) is a struggling writer and middle-school teacher who gets the bright idea to take his old college buddy Jack (Thomas Haden Church) on a scenic drive up Route 101 to the wine country off the Santa Barbara coast. Jack wants to get his nose into something more potent than a wine glass, however. As he watches this car wreck about to happen, Miles finds himself drawn uncomfortably close to a woman named Maya (Virginia Madsen) he's long admired from afar. Will he lose his fear of life and take a chance on love? Will Jack ruin everything if he tries?Underdog romantic comedies are nothing new, but few play with the conviction of ""Sideways."" Start with the performers. Giamatti has played a lot of annoying supporting roles in his time, and his style at times can be so ingratiating it's painful. Yet he delivers a wonderful central performance here, working in the comedy and tragedy with subtle shifts of his eyes and strokes of his beard. You get big laughs from Miles, but you never forget the guy is human, even if he really is only a character in a movie. Giamatti makes him so identifiable, in his loser way, because losing is something we all can relate to one way or another.I can't claim Jamie Foxx stole an Oscar from Giamatti. Giamatti should have been nominated, but Foxx deserved it. Church and Madsen, on the other hand, deserved better than the nominations they got. People point to Madsen's speech on wine's glory as the greatest moment in the film, and she does a terrific job there and elsewhere making Miles' hope so believable and worthwhile, but Church is great, too, in a hundred different moments, sometimes without saying a word, like his wonderfully smug reaction when Miles' mother praises his long-ago TV role: ""Why that didn't make you the biggest movie star in the world is a sin!"" You know how Miles would take similarly loaded praise, and it's a great contrast that sets up the rest of the film.Jack is a classic comedy character, slave to his libido, happy to coast through life on past glories, and Church gets every laugh and then some, but also engenders sympathy with his skewed-but-sincere loyalty to Miles and the fact he (like most of the audience) is completely in the dark when Miles discourses about tannins and soupcons of Edam cheese.You have to love a film that discourses so knowledgably about wine, and yet sends up wine aficionados as boozers with big lexicons, Miles holding his ear for subtle textures on his fifth glass. Unlike other ""dramadys"", say the cloying and manipulative Oscar-magnet ""Terms Of Endearment,"" ""Sideways"" makes sure its laughs are big ones, and that there aren't too long a wait between them.Each time I watch ""Sideways,"" I'm blown away by something different. The clever script by director Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor (which did win an Oscar) is an obvious choice, but what about that fantastic low-key bebop score by Rolfe Kent, or the sterling camera work? Watch how the lens hides Maya when she leans into Miles, about to tell him what she thinks of wine (and metaphorically, him), then catches her full-in-frame, almost angelically aglow in the mellow porch light.Not everyone struggles to publish an 800-page manuscript. But nearly everyone has struck out in some crucial way, which is why Miles and Jack and their journey have become pretty popular. We all know as we age what its like to lose big, and worry how that losing defines us. ""Sideways"" to me is a film about finding success in not giving up even when one begins to realize how much of life is about losing.Yet for all the talk of losing, ""Sideways"" proved a winner. Touring California's wine country has become pretty popular for aging Boomers and Xers, tracing the journey of Miles and Jack like pilgrims in the Holy Land. Pinot Noir sales are up, while Merlot sales are down. That's pretty cool economic clout for an art film. So what if it got cheated at the Oscars? If ""Sideways"" got what it deserved, how much of an underdog's film would it really be?",Sideways
74,EUyeshima,Sharply Observed Road Trip With Finely Etched Performances,9,31 March 2008,"In director/co-screenwriter Alexander Payne's hands, the buddy picture takes on deeper shades of complexity and vulnerability. Adapting Rex Pickett's 2004 book with Jim Taylor, Payne continues on the particularly idiosyncratic film-making path that he started with the hilariously acidic ""Citizen Ruth"" and ""Election"" and seemed to deepen with the meandering ""About Schmidt"". The premise of this 2004 film sounds flimsy on the surface - two guys, one about to get married, take a week-long trip through the Santa Barbara wine country as a last hurrah celebration filled with fine wine, good food and golf. But the execution of this plot is full of shrewd observations and so many delightfully unexpected scenes that seem like non-sequiturs at first but somehow mesh into a story that keeps you guessing what will come next. It's a fascinating journey, often hysterical, sometimes painful, about lost opportunities and facing one's deep-seeded fears.The characters are familiar and unpredictable at the same time, and the actors inhabiting them are terrific. In a relatively understated, finely detailed performance, Paul Giamatti provides the emotional core of the story as put-upon, unrelentingly dissatisfied Miles, the pinot wine aficionado so caught up in his passion for the grape he has no idea how pretentious he sounds. His character's aching, post-divorce vulnerability and decreased sense of worth wring truthfully through his hound dog expressions, excessive drinking and pained fits of anger. A failing novelist and quite likely an alcoholic, Miles hides behind his extensive wine knowledge to avoid getting hurt again even when confronted by a beautiful woman open to the possibility of starting a relationship with him. After years of medium-level success in TV sitcoms, Thomas Haden Church makes the ideal comic foil as Jack, a has-been soap star and self-proclaimed ladies' man who is not nearly ready to face commitment at the altar.The two actors have an easy and sometimes tense rapport as best friends with opposite approaches to life but a strong sense of devotion to each other. Their wine tasting scenes with a liberal use of jargon, in particular, are hilarious in that only-in-California sort of way. Of course, women complicate the journey. Sandra Oh shows surprising female swagger as wine pourer Stephanie, who blindly falls for all of Jack's lines. And it's gratifying to see Virginia Madsen make the most of a good role. This beautiful, searingly intelligent actress has been kicking around bad potboilers and horror flicks for over two decades, and it's about time someone saved her from Lifetime TV-movie hell. She plays the smart, wine-worshipping waitress Maya with lovely subtlety and has a wonderfully transfixing, wine-as-life monologue that makes Miles look all the more foolish for not capitalizing on the moment.But like a wine that peaks and fades, as she seductively describes, so does Miles in fits of depression that make his search for love and fulfillment an evasive proposition at best. The 2005 DVD package provides a wonderfully hilarious commentary track courtesy of the improvisational wit of Giamatti and especially Church, who seems to be a treasure trove of erudite trivia. Make sure to have the English subtitle feature on as they talk non-stop over the film. Their natural chemistry is unforced off-screen. Eight deleted scenes are included with Payne's written descriptions of what function they served and why they were ultimate excised. My favorite is a side trip to the mall to shop for a pair of sporty sneakers for Miles. There is a brief making-of featurette, totally dispensable, and the original theatrical trailer.",Sideways
75,fertilecelluloid,Well written drama with a natural sense of humor,8,7 January 2005,"Alexander Payne's latest (after ABOUT SCHMIDT) is not a comedy or a buddy movie; it's a ""road"" movie about two middle-aged friends who take a break from the rat race in California's wine country.It's funny because it's true, not because it's constructed to make us laugh.Paul Giamatti, as the morose ""Miles"", anchors the picture with an absorbing, believable performance. Thomas Haden Church, as Jack, is a helpless womanizer whose aim is to cut loose before his impending marriage.The two women the boys hook up with are very nicely played by Virginia Madsen and Sandra Oh.The drama builds from the flaws of the characters. The plotting is totally character-driven and there are no false notes or contrivances to spoil the film's naturalism.The script is leisurely but never boring.Payne has an acute ear for dialog and isn't reluctant to leave some issues unresolved in order to move forward -- as is the natural process of life itself.Recommended as an example of solid scripting and intelligent direction of actors.",Sideways
76,triple8,I wanted to call the creators of the movie afterward and thank them....,10,6 February 2005,"I have seen many good movies on the big screen this year, a few of them even perfect 10's. But none of them, as good as they were and as perfect 10's as they were, had yet made it on to my top 10 of all time. That was before I saw Sideways.I must take a moment to thank a close friend of mine who was literally relentless that I see this. The week it came out when it was still very unknown, she called me to say she had just seen one of the best films ever made. She begged me to see it then. I didn't but in a way I'm glad I waited because I saw this at the perfect time and early enough to root for it at the Oscars.Sideways is about two men, both at a crossroads in their life, who go away on a vacation to the California wine country. It is about their journey and what happens to them during these few Short days. It is a character study and is both, one of the funniest(if not the funniest) movie I have ever seen, and also One of the most touching. This is a movie that's clearly at it's best because of the characters and their instant relatability. This is a must see for anyone who has ever experienced self doubt, doubt about their future, doubt about life and it's meaning, and doubt about anything in general. It is a great movie and I actually feel gratitude that this movie was made.I am not going to give away any of the plot by discussing any funny lines(and yes this comment does say :MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS but still....). I will say one small thing though-when the two men go back to get something that was left behind, keep your eyes on the television set.I am amazed that Paul Giamotti was not nominated for an Oscar but glad Thomas Haydon and Virginia Madson were. All four of the main characters were unforgettable and there is so much to like about this movie I better stop, lest I go on for 10 pages. For me, I give a movie a 10 when I don't see how any one scene could have been done any better. In the case of Sideways, everything from the acting, and incredible direction, to the beautifully filmed scenery of the California Wine country and amazingly appropriate music, to the vivid sweetness and the emotional depth of the movie, coupled with some of the most unforgettable people, and delightful wittiness I have ever seen makes this movie not just a 10, but one of the best movies I've ever seen and a treasure for those who appreciate movies that reach out and touch the soul.I hope this gets to people who still may not have heard about it or are not quite sure what it's about. I also hope it wins the Oscar. Go sideways! And go people, to the theaters if you haven't seen this!",Sideways

78,rosscinema,Beautifully observant film is one of the years best,8,21 November 2004,"I've never heard so much information about wine tasting in a film before but when this was over I felt like having a glass even though I'm not much of a wine drinker. Besides all that this film gives us some of the best performances and dialog of the year in a film that's more about characters than plot. Story is about Miles Raymond (Paul Giamatti) and his soon to be married pal Jack (Thomas Haden Church) who go on a week long vacation together in the California wine country to sow their oats before the wedding. Miles is a teacher and a wine connoisseur but he's also deeply depressed about being divorced and the ultimate failure of getting his novel published. Jack is a failed TV actor who is getting married on Saturday but wants to get laid in his last week of freedom and he vows to get his friend laid as well.*****SPOILER ALERT*****While staying in a hotel they meet Maya (Virginia Madsen) a waitress that Miles has known for years but is too shy to ask out but they also meet a pour at a winery named Stephanie (Sandra Oh) and Jack sets them all up for a double date. The girls don't know about Jack's upcoming wedding but he hits it off with Stephanie and later starts having doubts about his forthcoming nuptials. Miles and Maya move a little more slowly but eventually they start spending quality time with each other but all hell breaks loose when Miles accidentally spills the beans about Jack and his wedding.This film is directed by Alexander Payne (About Schmidt, Election) who has easily become one of the best directors working today and his films are less about plot and more about characterization which is why we continually see these terrific performances come out of his scripts. Payne obviously is more concerned about finding the right actor to embody the roles than getting a big Hollywood star but he always manages to get the fullest out of whomever he's hired. We haven't seen Madsen in a role this good in years and it's easily a career defining moment for her as she delivers a performance that's deep with feeling and also shows that she's nothing short of radiant to watch. Oh has already demonstrated that she's a solid actress and I've never seen her give anything but good efforts and Church shows to everyone that he should be considered for other good roles as he brings a good balance between comedy and drama. But this film belongs to Giamatti who for the second straight year proves that he's more than just a character actor and I do believe that this is one of the years best performances as no one plays these sad sacks better. The scene between him and Madsen as they tell each other in intimate detail their love of wine is the base for their upcoming relationship and it's a truly moving moment that is the film's best. This film isn't really trying to say anything thought provoking but what it wants to do is show the idiosyncrasies and paranoia of two men approaching middle-age and how they reflect on their lives. This is a deeply observant film that has some wonderful and honest dialog and it possesses some of the years best performances.",Sideways
79,Galina_movie_fan,"""In Vino Veritas""",9,28 January 2007,"Wine plays the big role in this film. Its characters taste wine, drink it, talk about it, travel in the Wine Country, California and learn about the birth, growing and maturing of this almost living thing. Most inspirational and moving monologues are dedicated to the ancient but forever young child of Sun, Air, Earth and Grape; to its liquid fire that soothes and warms the soul and mind and keeps many secrets in its velvety depth. To create the fine wine would take time, right components in the right proportions, and love. This film feels like a fine wine. Everything is perfect - the actors' choice, the acting, directing , and the pace. It is a long film but it never rushes and it is never slow. The perfect combination of hilarity and bitter-sweetness, humor and drama, depressing realizations about life and hope make ""Sideways' one of the best films of that year for me. It is the best of three Alexander Payne's films I've seen. This film like a fine wine would not get old or outdated. It would get better with each viewing; it would reveal more of its layers and its secrets, it would make you feel its taste and its unique aura long after you finish watching it.9.5/10",Sideways

81,nycritic,A Buddy Film that Lingers Like Fine Wine.,10,22 April 2005,"It's been a while since I saw a film that depicted buddies on the down-and-out meeting (or running away from) their destinies that had performances so nuanced as this film. In an age when movies have to appeal to a young crowd who is not that attentive to detail and prefers its visuals fast, furious, and simple, SIDEWAYS slows down a couple of paces and, like the wine ubiquitously present throughout, allows its own story to breathe and take its lovely, wistful taste as we follow the two main characters played by Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church in their ""weekend of debauchery."" One couldn't imagine two more mismatched people -- Giamatti plays an intellectual introvert while Haden Church plays an irresponsible goon still trapped in high school -- but one senses that these have been friends for a long time, even if their friendship is held on a tenuous string. But friends they are, and it's described in this trip that begins in Southern California as they drive up the coast and enter wine country, where they meet two women, Virginia Madsen and Sandra Oh, equally different, both a complement to the men and with whom the men pair up with. The fact that the Madsen/Giamatti pairing is tentative while the Oh/Haden Church pairing is essential to the back story of wine: where the latter display their affair ""all over the place, commonly"" like Cabernet, the former is defined closer to Pinot, and in one heartbreaking scene, both Giamatti and Madsen define their characters through the evolution of wine throughout the years.And it's this one scene that makes the movie. Madsen conveys so much more with so little and should have been more than an Oscar nominee: her short scene lingers far beyond her last appearance in the movie, and makes us want for more of her soulfulness. She is able to bring out the less seen, more fragile side of Giamatti's character and have him take the decision he takes at the end of the movie, and the fact that Payne does not take us into that scene is indicative of that power their tentative yet intense coupling has seared into our minds: this is romantic eroticism at its finest, lasting equally much longer than the more torrid affair Haden Church and Oh exhibit. There is no need to see that final scene, because as private as it is, we know that they will consummate their union beautifully and move on into the future since they are perfect for each other.Beautiful, saturated colors and light that evokes films of the 70s, long takes, edgy humor mixed with touching introspection, SIDEWAYS is a visual treat that gets better with subsequent viewings.",Sideways
82,raulfaust,New York New York,6,12 June 2013,"Well, ""Sideways"" is basically a movie trying to show how two different characters get along even thought they have major differences between their personalities. Jack is a womanizer, party animal and he is engaged to a woman, while he enjoys along with Miles a road trip before the wedding day. Miles, on the other side, is a guy who faces (or faced) depression and anxiety, which may have turned him into a negative person (in Jack's point of view). I have to complain that sometimes it bores the spectator, given that you're always waiting for something to happen, and it rarely does. You want to Miles to have a good time and have sex with a girl, but unfortunately, writers never give him such opportunity. Other than that, I feel very related to his character, even thought I don't have depression or anything; sometimes I don't feel like having occasional sex with someone I barely know, whilst I had an old friend that acted just like Jack in those situations. Albeit ""Sideways"" has a good character development, it feels like something's been missing, considering that the main plot gets nowhere. However, I must admit this is hugely entertaining and pleasant to watch.",Sideways
83,Rob_Taylor,"Not so much a road movie as a ""lie on the road and hope to be hit"" movie",3,30 March 2005,"Since so many people appear to be gushing effusive praise about this film I'd thought I'd come along and sour the punch, as it were.Sideways is a dull, tedious concoction that, at two hours plus, is at least 30 minutes longer than it should be. The incessant drivel about wine and all the processes involved in its creation are entirely unnecessary and probably take up at least fifteen minutes of screen time. We get that Giamatti is a wine-nut. We don't need to be reminded of it every few minutes. In fact, after about the sixth such discussion (including, astonishingly, ""name-dropping"" of various ""important"" wines and vintages) I found myself lacking any enthusiasm for the movie.And it' not just the anal wine-related dialogue that scores negatively in this picture. The characters are all so unremittingly boring and unlikeable. Giamatti, for instance, seems to have no other dimensions to his character than his wine expertise. Likewise Church's character obsesses about sex constantly. The fact that he is supposed to be married in a week's time and has no qualms about having sex with any woman he meets does not endear his character to the audience either.Having seen the hype and review comments such as ""the most hilarious comedy this year"" I began to wonder whether I'd got the film mixed up with some other movie. The ""laughs"" are few and far between and little more than smiles most of the time. For the first hour, you'll be hard pressed to extract any humour from the film at all. It's only after this that the movie starts to pick up a little, but by then, you've sat through an hour of wine jabber and scenes of the California countryside and the odd set-piece designed to make you dislike the characters ever more strongly.The ludicrous scene where Jack (Church) cries over the loss of his wedding rings (which were lost during a sexual encounter) is stunningly unbelievable and non-plussing.In short, the movie is dull. On the same level as dismal soap operas that mimic ""real-life"".And perhaps worse, there are no moral scruples reclaimed at the end. We all know that life is rarely kind and people don't always get the chance to redeem their mistakes. But in this movie, none of the moral failings of the characters go unrewarded. In fact, the characters themselves seem to show little or no remorse for their actions.Miles ends up with the girl, despite betraying her trust. Nor does he make amends for stealing his elderly mother's money. Similarly, Jack, for all his womanizing, ends up marrying his oblivious sweetheart. Nor does Jack undergo any form of punishment (other than a busted nose) for stringing Stephanie along.Nor are there any loyalty traits displayed between the two main characters. Miles, after letting the cat out of the bag to Maya, then doesn't tell his friend Jack that the game is up, instead letting him face the wrath of his current sex partner unexpectedly.The only ""message"" this movie gives out is ""Do what you want and to hell with the consequences"".Summary: Dull, tiresome, morally objectionable and with nothing of interest to offer the audience except wine mumbo-jumbo. Awful, just awful.",Sideways
84,Matt_Layden,I am NOT drinking any f*cking Merlot!,8,25 February 2005,"For people to say you have to be around 30 or so to enjoy this brilliant film....you're wrong, I'm 16 and absolutely loved it.Paul Giamatti robbed again. This performance is one of the best all year (How the hell Clint got in over Paul, I will never know). Here is a performance so touching and yet hysterical at the same time that you can't help but love the guy. You feel his sadness, you feel his love, you feel his laughter and of course you feel his drunkenness. My favourite scene in this film was when Miles finds out that his ex-wife is pregnant. The hurt on Giamatti's face is perfectly executed, and yet he also feels a closure and tries to show that he is also happy for her, which he is, all these emotions were portrayed perfectly.Thomas Haden Church was great, the character was an asshole, but hey, I still liked him, Church gives the character a human quality that you can't dismiss and for some you will attach to him, for others, you will hate him, but in the end, you know that the performance is worthy of a nomination. Virginia Madson and Sarah Oh, both give great supporting roles and are the glue to make the film stick together, without them the film would have been missing a lot of emotion on the other end of the spectrum (meaning we get a lot from giamatti, but here are some others). The script was very clever and human. You don't know what is going to happen next because we as humans are unpredictable, so their actions are unpredictable. I honestly did not think this film was going to be funny, I walked into the theatre thinking it was a drama and walked out laughing my ass off. There are too many funny scenes (involving dialouge) to name, but my favs include: ""I am not drinking any f*cking Merlot""The direction here is perfect, who better to get to direct a movie then the writer, who can handle the characters perfectly and guide the actors into the right direction. Payne does this and with his brilliant cast he only needs to point in that direction, they take it from there. I love the ending, it is so ANTI-Hollywood, (just like Eternal Sunshine and hell even The Aviator for that matter). We need more films like these instead of films where talking animals are crappy sequels (Do we need a mask 2) come out. We need movies that we can connect with, we need characters that we can relate to, films that will touch our hearts and make us feel every emotion that one can have in 2 hours or so. The film is my 3rd favourite film of 2004. Eternal sunshine and Kill Bill Vol 2 taking the first two spots, but I'm excited to see what Payne can show us in the future and as always, I'm looking forward to one of Giamatti's next films, he is quickly becoming one of my favourite actors.9/10",Sideways

86,stensson,"Vine, women...",7,18 June 2005,"This is quite immoral. People are having several glasses of vine every day and then go driving. Nobody gets killed however, but one is being beaten up. This is about two middle-aged friends. One of them is going to marry and this is his last week of freedom. That theme has been filmed before, but here it is done in an intelligent way.The one who's not gonna marry (Paul Giamatti) makes a very good portrait of the insecure 45-year-old who never learned how to ""handle"" women. His insecurity is shown like it is presented in real life, including the shy way in which he finally dares to touch a girl, while the other guy (Thomas Hayden Church) who is the silly one of them, goes by instinct all the time and wins all the time.

87,DeeNine-2,"Clever, very clever",10,14 December 2005,"I was a little surprised to see this billed as a comedy. Not that I didn't experience many wry grins, tickling chuckles, and some outright belly laughs as I watched it. I did. And it is a whole lot funnier than most movies that are supposed to be comedies. But this is not a comedy, per se. It is a relationship movie. It is a buddy movie. It is a brilliant tour de force by Alexander Payne, who along with Jim Taylor wrote the original script, and who directed, based on the novel by Rex Pickett. On the basis of seeing two of his movies, this and Election (1999) I can say without the slightest doubt, Payne is one very talented man who has Hollywood by the proverbials.Both the script and the direction were superb. One might say Payne spent a little too much time developing character, but when you see the result, you have to say, it was worth it. Yes, the movie begins a little slowly, just a little. Everything seems a little on the ordinary side. There is not much happening. We can see that Miles is one of life's losers and that his best bud Jack is one of life's lucky guys. They are off to the wine country for one last buddy time together before Jack gets married.Jack is a sometime, somewhat talented actor. God, I knew a few of those guys. And Miles is a talented but somehow failed writer, a school teacher who has penned a 750-page novel. Oh, Lord let me buy you a Mercedes Benz. (Sorry that lyric just slipped in.) He also reminds me of someone.Miles recently (two years ago actually) got dumped by the true love of his life, his now ex-wife Victoria. And Jack, bless his heart, is about to marry a very well appointed and very nice looking young woman who lives in a grand house in Palos Verdes (in the script; in the movie it's more like BelAir or thereabouts--which amount to about the same thing). And so off the two go for wine and golf and the open road. But be back by Friday night for the rehearsal. (I'll say no more about that, but keep the word ""rehearsal"" in mind. Those who have seen the movie know what I mean.) All right I confess. This movie hit home with me. I have been there and done that in a number of ways. In fact, the familiarity kind of put me off at the beginning. I mean, I have been to France and I have drunk Château Cheval Blanc, and to be honest I have also drunk great burgundies with (God help us) fast food, although unlike Miles I took the food home; I wouldn't de-sanctify the wine by drinking it on the sly at a diner. By the way, Cheval Blanc is NOT a burgundy and it not made with Pinot Noir grapes. It is a red wine from Bordeaux made with Merlot and Cabernet Franc grapes.And I and a buddy dated two young women many years ago and almost the same thing happened. But never mind.In other words, the movie is realistic, so much so that I suspect a lot of viewers will find something in it that relates directly and even spookily to their own lives. Watch it and see.Can you be too realistic? Can a movie be so absolutely true to life that it...what? Loses something? Is too painful? Is too prosaic? Well, I almost thought that in the beginning. But the movie is so well planned, so well contrived (if you will) so aggressively true to life and honest about human nature that I came within a hair breath of turning it off.Don't you do that! Don't give up on this movie! It is craftily planned to reward the viewer with a most interesting and enjoyable movie experience. This is not to say it is perfect. Some of the wine dialogue is compromised because what is said must make sense to the general viewer while at the same time remain true (almost) to what afficionados of wine would actually say. And yes, Payne could have cut to the chase a little quicker. But sometimes the appetite is whetted when the meal is delayed.In addition to a brilliant script and some very fine direction from Payne, the movie is blessed with some excellent casting. Paul Giamatti is perfect as Miles, who really is not a loser. Thomas Haden Church is exactly right as the attractive and confident, every-hustling, womanizing, marginal actor who will get his comeuppance in the next life, not in this one. Sandra Oh provides a perfect fit as the Asian-American who falls heavily for American men who are not necessarily of Asian descent; and Virginia Madsen keeps just enough of her beauty hidden to be believable as the waitress with a head on her shoulders.I guess I could give Hollywood the ultimate compliment and say that this movie is so slick that it doesn't seem in the slightest bit slick. That it is so realistic that one never thinks for a moment that it is contrived. To paraphrase somebody, the essence of the art of story, whether it be a novel, a short story or a movie, is in believable characters in believable situations doing the things we all do, but in a way that goes beyond realism to artistry. If you can fake that you can make it big not only in Hollywood but anywhere there is an audience, a viewer, a reader, anybody who seeks to be enlightened and entertained and experience the catharsis that art can bring.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

And rarely does this kind of film get the Oscar nod.The two principal characters played by Paul Giamatti (last seen but not by many in the brilliant and memorable ""American Splendour"") and Thomas Haden Church are two friends going for a last weekend of wine tasting around Southern California's wineries just before the marriage of one of them. One is a frustrated novel writer and English teacher still in pain over his divorce of two years ago. The other is his chum from the college they attended some twenty years ago, a commercial voice/over-actor about to embark on marriage. He is equally unfulfilled in his career ambitions.It takes off from there in twists and turns through the fabulous California countryside and satisfies on every level.

90,sme_no_densetsu,Another well-written comedy-drama from Alexander Payne,8,23 January 2017,"""Sideways"" marked Alexander Payne's first Oscar win, following a previous writing nomination for 1999's ""Election"". Nominated for both writing & directing, he ended up taking home a statuette for his adapted screenplay (shared with Jim Taylor, the co-writer of ""Election"").On the surface, the movie might not sound like much: A struggling writer takes his long-time friend on a road trip through California's wine country as a send-off prior to his impending nuptials. But what brings the movie to life are the vivid characters, their interactions with one another and their motivations.The always reliable Paul Giamatti plays sad-sack Miles, a divorced English teacher & wine aficionado whose life is mired in depression. His best friend Jack is played by Thomas Haden Church, best known for his role as Lowell in the long-running sitcom ""Wings"". Jack's positive outlook and energy are a perfect contrast to Miles's generally negative attitude towards everything. Thomas Haden Church snagged an Oscar nomination for his performance but Paul Giamatti was unaccountably (and unexpectedly) snubbed. Virginia Madsen also landed an Oscar nomination for her performance as Miles's love interest, while Sandra Oh rounded out a stalwart main cast.The Oscar-winning script gave these talented actors & actresses plenty to work with and they were expertly guided by director Alexander Payne. Oscar-nominated for both writing & directing, Payne exhibited his knack for crafting idiosyncratic comedies that are strengthened by a meaningful dramatic core. Both visually attractive and musically interesting, the movie is slickly produced without seeming artificial.In the end, though, ""Sideways"" may not be for everyone. The two main characters are admittedly not the greatest guys. They both have their faults and it's difficult to say how a given viewer will respond to them. Personally, I found Thomas Haden Church's character to be pretty unlikeable the first time I watched the movie. Then again, the fact that he made an impression on me shows that this wasn't to the detriment of the film. In any case, there's a lot to like about ""Sideways"", even if you aren't simpatico with the two main characters.",Sideways
91,punishmentpark,Shall I compare thee to a Woody Allen film?,10,19 July 2013,"I haven't seen too many Woody Allen films, to be honest, and they never came to mind when I watched 'Sideways' before, but this time they did several times. The character Miles, played by The Great Paul Giamatti could have easily popped up in almost any film by Allen, as could have many other characters here. Still, it doesn't feel right to compare - mostly because Alexander Payne's work speaks to me so much more - so I'll leave it at that.As said before, I've seen 'Sideways' (several times), but it never felt as intense ('deep', as Jack would say) as it did this time. More than in 'Election' and 'Citizen Ruth', which I watched and reviewed just before this one ('About Schmidt' will soon follow), the story and characters are low key, personal, intimate and digging deeper, culminating in a true masterpiece of drama with (dark) comedy and (failing) romance lurking in almost every corner - and for contrast, it is mostly sunny and picturesque throughout (yes, I missed Nebraska just a little, but hey).One of my favorite scenes is the one where Miles and Jack go on their first date with Maya and Stephanie (starting when Miles and Jack walk to the restaurant up to where Miles and Maya say goodbye in the dark by their cars), which evolves in such a natural and realistic way, it's hard to believe this it's really a film with actors working from a script.The rest you will have to go see for yourself, while I'm here facing the 'problem' of 'Sideways' being my favorite piece by Payne thus far, but I already gave 'E.' and 'C.R.' 10 out of 10... 10+++ it is, then, problem solved.",Sideways
92,KUAlum26,Seven days in wine country...,9,24 May 2007,"...with two guys both at the crossroads of their lives. Sound like interesting,funny,poignant film-making worth watching? Before answering that,you might want to consider that A)this stars solid character actors Paul Giamatti,Thomas HAden Church,Virginia Madsen and Sandra Oh and B)is directed and co-written by down-to-Earth new wave filmmaker Alexander Payne. If you still said no,too bad. If you said yes,then besides being a particularly broad-minded film-goer,you will get a charge out of this movie.Two friends,passive-aggressive English teacher Miles(Giamatti,who somehow managed to NOT be Oscar nominated)and narcissistic alpha male JAck(Thomas HAden Church,quietly building quite the resume),agree to go on a scenic tour of various vineyards and lodges through Northern California,going to a variety of wine tastings and sampling the latest Bordeaux. This trip has different meaning for both men:for Jack,it's a last gasp(it would seem)of wilding for JAck before getting married,while it's a chance for divorce Miles to indulge his senses and lose himself away from his thankless job and the unpublished novel he's been nursing for years. They both end up meeting and in relationships with women they meet along the way:JAck has a frenzied,sexual connection with a single mom named Stephanie(Sandra Oh,pre-""Grey's Anatomy""),while Miles shyly courts the equally educated MAya(Virginia MAdsen,radiant!). Of course,as the two hop from bar to winery to winery to bar,they go through a variety of emotional reckonings that may(or may not)change their lives.I've been a fan of Payne's film-making going back to Citizen Ruth,and while this movie may lack some of the kinetic-ism of Election or the rising bravura of About Schmidt,it still is very strong. Adapted from a novel by Rex Pickett,this movie is all about making a tangible,true story out of what appears mundane--albeit lush in scenery and more than a hint of snobbery--and works for just that reason. Perhaps more alike to the subject material(i.e. wine)than it tries to be,this movie is a bit of an acquired taste,but it shouldn't be so hard to pick up if one's been through adulthood long enough to encounter their fair share of hopefulness and disappointment. Perhaps I was prejudiced to like this movie before I saw it,but that isn't always a guarantee that I'll fall for a film.

94,Cosmoeticadotcom,Good film,8,18 September 2008,"Sideways was a 2004 sleeper comedy hit by director Alexander Payne that really deserved its plaudits. He previously made the funny Reese Witherspoon comedy Election and the so-so Jack Nicholson film About Schmidt. The film's title comes from the proper way to store a bottle of wine, as well the angle a drunk sees the world from when he's recovering from passing out on the floor. While not a particularly deep film, and at two hours and four minutes in length it is about a half an hour too long, the film nonetheless does provide some insights into male insecurities and mid-life crises, as it celebrates human foibles in an intelligent manner. It was adapted by Payne and Jim Taylor from an unpublished novel by a writer named Rex Pickett, and won a well deserved Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay.The film follows in a long tradition of buddy comedies, from the silent era, wherein one guy is a good fellow, and the other is his ne'er do well pal. Basically, a week before the bad pal, his ex-college roommate, Jack (Thomas Haden Church), a failed actor, is to get married, his good pal, Miles (Paul Giamatti), a divorced school teacher of English, and an aspiring novelist, plans to take him on a week's getaway to the California wine country, to relax and play golf. the film is a ray of hope for viewers who want intelligent films, especially comedies, from someone not named Woody Allen. Payne was quoted as saying, in an online interview: 'I want Sideways, which has no movie stars in it, and a movie for which I had final cut, to make money, not just for my own career but for other film makers so that film makers and studios can point, if I didn't have stars to make money, Sideways didn't have a gun or a chase even though that made money, we have to be changing our cinema, little by little and have more human films. But the only way it's going to happen is there are examples they can point to, where they made money. It was just like that in the late 60s and 70s. Look, Easy Rider made money, The Graduate made money, Midnight Cowboy made money, and we should make more movies like those. That's what we need.'He's right, of course. Here's hoping that he has a long career of such hits as Sideways, but that he only gets better with each succeeding film.",Sideways
95,Sirus_the_Virus,Good film.

It was nominated for best picture. I guess it deserves the nomination. Though it wasn't my favorite film of that year. Mine was Kill Bill Vol. 2. Because Tarantino is a genius. As is someone like Alexander Payne.Alexander Payne has done films such as Election and About Schmidt. Election was weird while About Schmidt was fantastic and perhaps my favorite film of 2002. Payne has such a way with comedy. Just watch a half hour of Sideways and you'll know what I am talking about.Thomas Hayden Church and Paul Giamatti star as friends. When Church's character is engaged, Giamatti's takes him to the wine country in California. Where both of them fall in love. Giamatti falls for Virginia Madsen's character, and Church's character falls for Sandra Oh's. I am not going to go into anymore about the plot. You'll have to watch it for yourself. This film is great. I didn't like it as much as Eternal sunshine or Kill Bill 2 obviously. But if you haven't seen it, man you're missing out on a classic. An instant classic.

It doesn't star such a great cast (even though Virginia Madsen always gives convincing performances) but gets to be both entertaining and melancholy. No title could have been more appropriate, since fellows depicted in this film are the typical kind of people who don't look and go forward but usually stand sideways. The four characters, sometimes all together, sometimes in pairs, talk about their life and love, even through the metaphor of wine, its necessity to breathe and its delicacy.

This one is better than most and features one of my favorite recent stars, Paul Giamatti. Paul has great range, I saw him first as the conflicted police chief in The Illusionist, here he plays a much different character - a middle school English teacher with an encyclopedic understanding of wine and unrealized ambitions as a writer.Giamatti and Church, college buddies, take off for a week of wine tasting in the Southern California vineyards before Church's wedding. Paul, still getting over a divorce, wants to kick back but Church is looking for an extended bachelor party. Giamatti's depression, while no doubt realistically portrayed, is a little too intense for me at spots, for which this gets docked a point. Madsen is great (as always) as possible love interest Maya. Satisfying wrap.",Sideways
98,bobsgrock,"Colorful and tasty, touching and bitter; just like wine.",8,8 September 2008,"To be frank, first of all, this movie is extraordinarily well-acted. Paul Giamatti Thomas Haden Church, Sandra Oh, and Virginia Madsen all deliver very good performances as four people from different walks of life that double up together while the two men Jack (Church) and Miles (Giamatti) are on a road trip in the wine country of California. Soon, Jack and Stephanie (Oh) are in a hot and passionate affair while Miles and Maya (Madsen) are left to themselves and the common love between them: great wine. There are a few scenes between the two where they are discussing wine but there is double meaning to what they are saying as they are also referring to themselves and the relationship between them.The best of this movie is the screenplay co-written by director Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor. It starts with a little background info on Miles Raymond, a self-loathing aspiring novelist who is taking Jack on a trip the week before his wedding to get away, eat good food, drink good wine, and enjoy life. Jack just wants to get laid before he becomes trapped in the bonds of marriage, and this mismatch soon leads them to Stephanie and Maya. To me, the best part of this movie was the handling of the two relationships by director Payne. He does a masterful job of showing how the two contradict each other; one is fast, hot and heavy while the other is slow and based more on mutual respect for each other. Paul Giamatti as well gives an incredible performance as the depressed yet sometimes brilliant Miles who ends up having a life-changing experience in one week.The downside of this terrifically told tale is the ending. It ends on a down note, but for me the way most of the characters end up isn't satisfying enough. It all leads up to one of the best endings I've ever seen in a movie. The end may disappoint, but for the most part, Sideways is a funny, moving story about wine and life and how they intersect each other.",Sideways

And watching such a talented actor was quite a chore here.I'll be honest, I didn't ""get it"". A few men go to the wine country, one is to be married. they get up there and in counter a tramp girl and a good girl. Hearts are broken. Big Whoop. What I really mean is: big stereotype.

100,Philby-3,Goes down well,8,20 February 2005,"This Art-house-style comedy cost $US 16 million and has already grossed over three times that in the US alone. And it's a good film a buddy movie reminiscent of ""Thelma and Louise"" with ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" (here Armenian) at the end.The two protagonists, Miles and Jack, could hardly be more mismatched . The plot has them old college roommates, but it's hard to see them sharing a room for more than five minutes. Miles is an English teacher, quiet, introspective, a frustrated novelist, recently divorced and a wine enthusiast. Jack is a not very successful actor, shallow, vain, not over-bright, an indiscriminant drinker of anything alcoholic and a dedicated chaser of the female of the species. Somehow, Jack has got engaged to Christine, from a prosperous Armenian-American family, and somehow, Miles gets to take Jack on a wine appreciation tour of the vineyards and wineries of Southern California as a distraction from his forthcoming wedding. Jack of course wants to get laid and he wants Miles to get laid as well. They soon meet up with some good prospects, Maya and Stephanie (it seems just about every waitress in the wine country is amenable to a one-night stand) but of course it's not as simple as it seems.At times, with the dippy duo bowling through the lovely vineyard country in Miles's old Saab convertible, sun on their faces and wind in their hair, it's all a bit like a tourist promotion piece. There are several episodes of outright slapstick, such as when Miles is sent to sneak in to the home of one of Jack's one-night stands to recover his wallet containing the wedding rings. But this is comedy-drama, not farce; two disparate guys hitting forty and wondering what the hell life is really about and where they are going. Miles of course has been chronically depressed since his divorce and he initially muffs the chance of connecting with Maya. Jack, after a lifetime of f***ing them and forgetting them, is quite rightly terrified at the prospect of something he has no aptitude for or experience of  monogamy.Paul Giamatti, who so successfully impersonated the cartoonist Harvey Pekar in ""American Splendour"", is marvelous as Miles. He acts with his whole body and every glance says something. Thomas Church as Jack has a more straightforward role, but he doesn't miss a beat. He has the great advantaging of looking exactly right for the part but the performance is right on the mark as well. Virginia Madsen as Maya manages to convince us that someone as attractive and as personable as she would be interested in a balding, introverted wine bore like Miles, even if he can describe Pinot Noir in truly poetic language. I also liked Sandra Oh as Stephanie, one of Jack's pick-ups, who gives her minor role plenty of verve.Alexander Payne seems to have a sure touch as a director of comedy dramas after ""Election"" and especially after ""About Schmidt"". He starts off a bit slowly here, but the mixture of slapstick and seriousness blends together well, and you get involved, if not engrossed.",Sideways
101,film-critic,I like how wine continues to evolve...,10,11 May 2005,"I will continually stand by my point with two arguments pertaining to this film. The first being that this fine piece of cinematic brilliance should have won an Academy Award this year. The Academy should not have just handed Alexander Payne the award for Best Screenplay (as they did Sophia Coppola), but instead awarded him top honors. This was more than just a story about a famous singer, or an aviator, or a suffering boxer, but instead a story about the human spirit, the bond of friendship, and the power of wine. To me, all very symbolic of being a human being. The second argument that I have is that Paul Giamatti was, literally, robbed from being involved with the Oscars this year. His performance was the strongest that I saw last year, and the strongest that I have seen so far this year. He brought his character to life, giving us this sense of ""every man"" coupled with that oh-so-familiar feeling of loss and frustration. We have all been there, we have all seen the effects that it can have on us, and I truly think that Giamatti best embodied that sensation.With that grumbling aside, I strongly think that this was an amazing film by any standards. The performances, like wine, were rich, subtle, and just some small scents of fruitiness. Alexander Payne has proved, with this film and his previous outings that he can capture the American spirit while also showing us a world that is originally not seen in other films. I cannot remember the last film that I saw where wine was nearly the central character and the surroundings just happened to be quaint little bits of wine country. The cinematography was beautiful and breathtaking. For any of us that have never been to that side of the world, Payne gives us that glimpse and creates that sensation of excitement. After seeing this film, I want to go there, I want to smell what Miles smelled, while racing through the vineyards. You know that a film has been successful when it actually creates a stir in your body to want to visit that place and experience it yourself. Payne not only miraculously showed us a beautiful part of our country, but also brought forward the passion for wine. Wine enthusiasts could only have written the speeches that Giamatti delivers. While I know that Payne did not do this all his own, you could almost taste the wine that he, Jim Taylor, and Rex Pickett tasted while they were writing. It is one of those rare cinematic moments where the wine just seeps from the edges of your television, and you instantly fall in love.So, you have a brilliant mind behind the camera giving the direction, you have a passionate subject that explores one of America's pastimes, what else is there to rave about this film. Well, as if I didn't semi-mention it already, how about the acting? Could anyone else have put together a stronger cast than Payne did? Would anyone else have seen Giamatti as the lead and thought that he could handle the pressures of a leading man? What about Thomas Haden Church? Did anyone think that this material would put his name into the Oscar scrapbook? Then there is Madsen, who literally ventured out of the dark to do this project, and she proved that she is ready for Hollywood. To say that the acting in this film carried this picture would be bad, because every element co-existed together perfectly, but the acting was a notch above your normal field of Hollywood movies. Giamatti was, well, a genius and I will forever wave my fist at the Academy for forgetting him. He couldn't have carried this film on his own, thanks to Oh, Church, and Madsen, these four prove they were the power behind this movie. They were jaw-dropping pieces of perfection.Overall, as if you couldn't tell already, I thought that this was one of the best cinematic outings to come out of Hollywood this year. Payne, unlike his early work with Miramax, had complete creative control over this project and he proved that he could handle a balanced story, with complex characters and plenty of wine. His passion for our American landscape shined brightly through this film as it did with About Schmidt, as he toured us through some unknown nooks and crannies of our nation. He proved that he could bring some lost nobodies out into the mainstream light and prove that he could bring the best out from them. He proved, to the film community, that he is ready for bigger, bolder projects, and I have no doubt in my mind that we will soon see his face with a ""Best Director"" Oscar right next to it. Alexander Payne is one of Hollywood's most under-appreciated secrets, and it is about time that he is unleashed onto the world.Bravo Sideways, Bravo.Grade: ***** out of *****",Sideways

But in the second half, things started taking turns toward the absurd. Actual laugh-out-loud moments were very few, but the performances of the cast were very good (Oscar material, though? I dunno about that...). This, however, is probably a much bigger movie to people who drink wine - personally I don't drink at all.Is this movie overrated? Am I surprised how grand a reception and rating it's received? I'd have to make that a resounding affirmative. For the first half especially, I really couldn't see what all the fuss was about. But while I don't think it's that special, I will say that it's a good, honest movie with some bitter-sweet comedy. Feels a lot like a TV movie to me, though.7 out of 10.",Sideways
104,hall895,Great acting makes for a great movie,8,15 May 2015,"Paul Giamatti, Thomas Haden Church, Virginia Madsen and Sandra Oh each fit their respective roles perfectly. They perform those roles wonderfully. The story in Sideways is compelling, the scenery is terrific, there's a lot to recommend the film. But there is no doubt that it is the performances of the four main players which really make the film such a success. And there is no doubt that it is indeed a raging success. It's a film which is funny when it needs to be funny, serious when it needs to be serious and charming when it needs to be charming. Director Alexander Payne strikes the right tone throughout.While all four of the key performers are crucial to the film it is Giamatti who clearly is the focal point here. He plays Miles, whose life is a mess. He's depressed. He's an author who can't get his book published. He's recently divorced and not the least bit over it. He's a wine aficionado whose love for wine veers towards alcoholism. To be blunt, Miles is a loser. But a lovable loser. And that is so important for the film. You identify with Miles, you root for him. Full credit to Giamatti for making that so. Miles is taking his friend Jack, played by Church, on a road trip through California wine country in the week before Jack's wedding. For Miles this trip is about camaraderie and great wine. Jack has other ideas. He's looking for one last great sexual fling. Two women enter the picture. Of course they do. Jack will have his fling with Stephanie, played by Oh. Meanwhile Miles makes a connection with Maya, played by Madsen. Maya is a waitress whom Miles has secretly pined over for quite some time. And why not? She's smart, she's beautiful and she loves wine. Can Miles make his move? Well, let's just say that a smooth operator he is not.Sideways is a film which definitely holds your attention. You want to see what is going to happen to these characters. Miles may be the focus but the other three leading characters are well developed as well. Each has their own story to tell. And the connections these characters make with one another lead the story down very interesting paths. It is a film which can tug at the heartstrings. There are some very serious moments. But before things can ever get too dark a slapstick comedy moment comes along to put a smile on your face. It is a very finely balanced film, Payne is certainly to be credited for that. The film has a wonderful script, there is so much great dialogue. And the actors do that dialogue justice. Just watching two people sit and talk can be intoxicating, this is never shown more clearly than in a fabulous scene shared by Giamatti and Madsen. They sit outside talking about wine. But what are they really talking about? Subtext is everything. That scene is the best example of the film's subtle genius. What this film presents to you on the surface is excellent. But dig a little deeper and there's so much more there. This is a great film. Lift your glass to salute all involved. But it better not be Merlot in that glass!",Sideways
105,sharky_55,What about the guy who wrote Confederacy of Dunces?,8,31 July 2016,"In movies, a writer is not just a writer - they are stuck in a mid- life crisis, or they are depressed, or have serious writer's block - you know, the tortured artist type. Miles Raymond is a messy amalgamation of these tropes all bundled into one. A recent divorcée, comfortably settled into middle-aged pudginess, his passions as a wine connoisseur and a stand-by book deal are all that keep him from falling out of sight into mediocrity. And even the former may just be a guise for his alcoholism. Giamatti occupies the role naturally and masterfully, almost never overselling (except as he snatches a full barrel of wine and chugs it down). When he is pressed on the details of his book, he gives vague, reluctant answers on its semi-autobiographical nature and its extensive ideas, but it is unconvincing. What this really signals to us, and to a lesser extent those around him, is that this is merely a reflection of himself. His book is his life; it's a mess, going sideways, so of course he cannot talk about his own life let alone a plot synopsis. He is not alone on his soul-searching journey. Joining him is the washed-up actor Jack, who almost solely relies on his fading good looks to get by. The film is not about him, so he becomes a broadly drawn caricature of an adolescent instead of a man about to settle down. He refers to the woman he beds as animals (and falls in love with them soon after), and has wildly implausible business ideas and visions of escape on the eve of his wedding day (it is easy to tell they were college roommates). We know little about Christine because she simply doesn't matter. On a secondary level, Payne is re-imagining the college road-trip, the beer-guzzling, sex-filled odysseys that promise brotherhood and the night of your lives. Jack is practically living in one; he constantly attempts to hype up the trip as 'one last getaway' and the opportunity to go wild and lay with careless abandon. But Miles is the one who cannot cover his eyes to the truth, that they are middle-aged and sagging, and that it all seems a little sad. It isn't the reckless 18 year old stealing money from his mother to spirit off halfway across the country with his mates, it's the divorcée in his late 30s stealing money because he needs it. Later, they attempt to crash their car into a tree to provide cover for Jack's broken nose. Imagine a bunch of drunk teens doing the same, but they are yelling and chanting with fervour. It would be all too crushing and depressing in the hands of another director, but Payne manages to find humour which shouldn't be there. He has a natural knack for this; in Election it was the same theme, a marvellous satire about a grown man swooping to the maturity level of his students. Jack is there already. Miles is the same, only because of his tough exterior borne out of his divorce it takes a few drinks before he shows it. That is one factor in the haziness of the double date. The other is Miles has just discovered that his ex-wife has gotten remarried, and the phone is constantly ringing to him, begging him to pick it up and dial. So he does so and it's a disaster. But Jack shortly after gives his own recount of the past hour that has flown by in drunken stupor; a furious blow-by-blow of his appalling behaviour, chastising him for that ""f*cking ten-minute lecture on, what was it, Vouvrays?"" and for sabotaging his own chances with Stephanie. This is not only funny but reveals perhaps the only line of attack that Jack is willing to take at that moment, channeling his disapproval of the ""drunk and dial"" through his own romancing. Even when Miles and Maya are presented with a perfect opportunity and atmosphere they feel the need to speak in the only language they know. They share a passion for wine, and they talk lovingly not only of the drink itself, but of the experiences behind the making and tasting of them. Maya huskily describes the rise and peak of a good wine, and places a soft hand on his, but what she is actually doing is comforting him, putting all his mid-life crisis fears to ease, whispering that everything will be all right. So while he is using the language to hide and conceal his insecurities, she uses it to dig them out, to speak from the heart honest truths that she believes. No wonder she feels betrayed later on. Sideways is not about a quest for redemption; Miles doesn't get what he wants, and has to unsubtly concede his victory as Victoria announces her pregnancy. It is about those sticky lies that take root into the back of our mind, and stay there for as long as we let them, a self-sufficient cycle of pity and hatred. Sometimes, you need a little push to be let out.",Sideways
106,jhclues,Giamatti is Outstanding,10,3 April 2007,"The medium of the cinema can be entertaining as well as educational, and when it's done well, a film can be both. Such is the case with ""Sideways,"" directed by Alexander Payne, who also wrote the screenplay, which he adapted from the novel by Rex Pickett.Jack (Thomas Haden Church), an actor whose ""star"" peaked some eleven years earlier and who now ekes out a living primarily doing commercials, is about to be married. With one week to go before the big day, his best man/friend/former college roommate, Miles (Paul Giamatti), has cooked up a trip to California's wine country, where he proposes a week of friendship, good wine, good food and golf as a send-off for Jack into that most blessed state of matrimony.As is often the case with the hand that Life deals us, however, the week does not quite go as planned, for a couple of reasons: First, though Miles proclaims this week to be about Jack, Miles is battling his own demons of depression, which have plagued him for going on two years now, ever since his divorce from his beloved Victoria (Jessica Hecht). In addition to which, although he makes his living as an Eighth-Grade English Teacher, Miles is also an aspiring novelist, who happens to be waiting for a call from his agent, who has a publisher interested in the novel Miles has been working on for more than three years. So there is an ulterior motive for Miles at work here; a wine connoisseur, he's taking Jack into country that is not only familiar to him, but is without question a ""comfort zone"" for Miles, who desperately needs a temporary respite from his own cares right now.The other problem is that Jack has an inflated ego and an overactive libido, a potent combination that quickly dictates an alternate plan of action for the week. Jack, it seems, is bent on sowing every last wild oat that remains, active or dormant, within him, before his impending nuptials scheduled for the following Saturday. Soon he is involved with Stephanie (Sandra Oh), who works pouring samples of wine for visitors at one of the first vineyards to which Miles takes Jack on their tour.Jack then successfully devises a plan that gets Miles involved with Maya (Virginia Madsen), a waitress at one of the restaurants Miles frequents on his visits to this part of the world. Maya also happens to be a recent divorcée who is working on her Master's in Horticulture at one of the local colleges, as well as being a wine connoisseur in her own right and a friend of Stephanie's to boot. All of which sounds like the makings of a good time for all, with one exception: Jack conveniently fails to tell Stephanie that he is about to be married.Bad move, Jack...In ""Sideways,"" Payne has created a highly entertaining and emotionally involving film with characters and situations to which a broad cross-section of viewers will readily be able to relate and identify. Payne has an eye for nuance and subtlety, which makes his film- essentially a character study- a succinct examination of the human condition.Subtlety and nuance is exactly what Paul Giamatti brings to the role of Miles, as well. It's a performance that is so real it's almost excruciatingly so at times, but it makes Miles someone you can empathize with. Giamatti creates a sympathetic character you can't help but root for on this vast wilderness of a stage we call life; it's a performance that should easily have earned him an Oscar for Best Actor.Haden Church does an exemplary job, too, as Jack. He imbues his character with such believable self-centered shallowness that you want to laugh at him and hit him at the same time. The rub is, Jack knows what he's doing, but simply can't help himself; so in the end you may find yourself sympathizing with him anyway, because Haden Church presents Jack as someone who just does not possess the intellectual capacity to do otherwise, which somehow makes you want to let him off the hook. You realize that this is just Jack honestly being who he is. And it takes a good performance to get you as a viewer to that place.The striking Virginia Madsen does a good job, as well, as Maya, creating a character that is a perfect counterpart to the Miles created by Giamatti. And Sandra Oh, currently riding a surging wave of popularity due to her role on televisions ""Grey's Anatomy,"" brings some definite pizazz to her role of Stephanie, successfully displaying her character's spirit, while at the same time exposing a decidedly vulnerable side of her.The supporting cast includes Missy Doty (Cammi), M.C. Gainey (Cammi's husband), Patrick Gallagher (Gary the bartender), Marylouise Burke (Mile's mother), Alysia Reiner (Christine) and Stephanie Faracy (Stephanie's mother).A film that lends itself to repeated viewings, ""Sideways"" is one of those gems that makes you appreciate not only the artists involved, as well as the art of film-making, but the medium itself. I like this movie more every time I see it.",Sideways
107,rupie,a movie for grownups,7,24 January 2005,"No need to add to the lengthy commentary in previous responses, which give a more than adequate idea of what the film is all about. Suffice it to say that it's nice to see a movie meant for grownups for a change, in contrast the endless stream of glossy dreck issuing from Hollywood, ninety per cent of which seems aimed at adolescent males, and most of which relies on special effects, plot gimmicks, and other ephemera to gain audience. This film is reminiscent of real life, although having a lot more comic relief than real life affords.

108,Stampsfightclub,Beautifully directed issue driven drama,9,30 March 2008,"The sheer idea of this film is what attracted me to view it. Paul Giamatti's character Miles goes on holiday with his best friend to get away from problems at home and it's a finding yourself type of holiday as the pair encounter various problems and opportunities in California's wine country.I'm personally not a big wine taster but found the film very deep on the topic and was interested by the facts about different drinks that were encoded. The use of wine is a very symbolic object in this Oscar winning film, and is great as a little sub story to the other topics being covered.The plot is consistent, intriguing, deep, humorous and different throughout which makes it one of the best comedy dramas of recent times with its use of these qualities and issues, which include loyalty, friendship, marriage and commitment.These issues are put forward by a superb cast, making true personalities out of their characters, none more so than Giamatti (Cinderella man) whose negative character is stunning to watch as he deals with many issues regarding his personal life. And when things are appearing to go from bad to worse, it is interesting to see how he deals with life and more so himself.Church's character Jack is almost the complete opposite of Miles, who is more positive and is trying to make the most out of his life and we can see opposites working, showing the differences in personality, an important point to the film.The settings are marvellous, though some maybe criticized for being conventional, I thought they were great, especially the use of the bar and restaurant.Despite its strong passionate issues, it's a relaxing and enjoyable watch, with brilliance from all the cast.The direction is absolute brilliance, particularly one shot where the two central protagonists are sitting on a bench, a sensational drama.",Sideways
109,jon.h.ochiai,A Hint of... Breeze,8,17 April 2005,"I finally saw Director Alexander Payne's ""Sideways"" on DVD. It is perhaps the most frivolous and breezy acclaimed movie I have seen. I believe that is its endearing quality that has made the movie so beloved. The cast is great including the wonderful Paul Giamatti as Miles, the wannabe writer who is currently a middle school English teacher waiting on news from his Book Agent, and the outrageous Thomas Hayden Church as Jack, the one time famous TV actor, now getting by doing commercial voice-overs. Personally, the movie seems over-rated, and it is a little puzzling that it received as much Oscar acclaim as it did. ""Sideways"" is no doubt very funny, and extremely well written. However, it does not distinguish itself from other well made movies. For one thing, there does not seem to be a point for it's existence. ""Sideways"" is passionately about wine. I suspect that the movie's metaphor is that a bottle of wine is like people-- it is constantly evolving and you don't know what you really have until you open it. Or in the case of people, you don't know what you have unless you take a chance. The context is about the experience. Given this poetry and the great performances, at least personally neither the content nor context are all that compelling. ""Sideways"" is none the less enjoyable and breezy.Miles (Giamatti) and Jack (Church) head up to California wine country the week before Jack is getting married. For Miles it the last time to spend sometime with his bud before he is married. Jack on the other hand, just wants to get laid. Jack is getting married to Victoria (Jessica Hecht) whose Dad is very wealthy and someone who can extend his commercial acting career. Jack is a sell-out. Miles still has not recovered from his divorce from Cammi (Missy Doty). Under false pretenses (rather lying through their teeth) Jack and Miles hook up with locals, Stephanie (Sandra Oh) and her good friend Maya (Virginia Madsen). Miles finds a soul mate and fellow wine expert in Maya. Jack does not tell Stephanie that he is getting married at the end of the week. He also tells Maya that Miles is a published author. Miles is in a virtual no win situation. Jack and Miles are such lovable losers. Thomas Hayden Church is hilarious as Jack, who is consistently thinking from below the waist. Sandra Oh is amazing as the strong and no nonsense single Mom, Stephanie. She has a truly killer scene wielding her motorcycle helmet. Virginia Madsen is awesome as the muse-like Maya. Paul Giamatti's Miles is a wonderfully compassionate loser. An odd phrasing. More to the point with Giamatti, one never laughs at his character, instead one laughs and winces acknowledging something familiar. He gives an outstanding performance.""Sideways"" has it's moments, and much like wine it is all about the experience. Alexander Payne has a gift for quirky characters and poetic dialog. The experience for me was enjoyable, and not very compelling.",Sideways
110,TOMASBBloodhound,Payne strikes gold again with a wonderful character study.,10,17 May 2007,"Sideways is the story of two not quite middle-aged men spending a week in southern California's wine country before one of them will be getting married. The two are old college roommates, but on the surface, they would seem to share little else in common. The film is a study on infidelity, loneliness, redemption, and drinking wine. In no particular order. The film has four main characters who are the basis of the story. Plot development is secondary, and in some ways hardly necessary. The characters and their relationships to one another are the main attraction here.The main character, played wonderfully by Paul Giamatti, is a man named Miles. Miles is divorced, miserable, and quickly on his way to becoming a failed writer. He is cash-strapped to the point where a visit to his mother's house becomes as much about stealing money from her than it is about celebrating her birthday. Miles is physically less than attractive and knows it. He is obviously not at ease with the opposite sex, even when one of them is clearly willing to give him a chance. Miles has a strong knowledge of wines that he seems to hide behind in social situations. Many people who are uncomfortable among others tend to hide behind their knowledge of this and that to hopefully make themselves seem more interesting. Not much seems to be going right for Miles, until a beautiful waitress begins to open up to him. Jack, played by Thomas Hayden Church, is Miles' best friend. It will be his wedding that they will be celebrating next week. Jack is kind of a ruggedly handsome actor whose days on soap operas are now probably permanently behind him. Now he does voice-over work mostly in commercials. Jack would seem to have a lot going for him. He is reasonably successful, and he's about to marry a beautiful woman from a nice family. Therefore its quite shocking to see the depths that he quickly sinks into once the two are away on their own. We discover that Jack is also insecure, but not in the sense that Miles is. Jack is one of those guys who cannot stand the absence of female attention, even for a week. After pledging to get Miles laid on the trip, he soon quickly vows to get laid himself. Boy does he ever! Virginia Madsen plays Maya, whom Miles has the hots for. She's an extraordinarily kind woman working as a waitress and getting on with her life after a divorce. She, like Miles, also knows a good deal about wine. A romance blossoms between the two after a night on the town. One might doubt that Maya could be attracted to a man like Miles, but perhaps it is due to him being the opposite of her former husband. Maya claims the man was a phony. Miles is obviously a wreck who appears sincere beneath his shyness. Plot complications involving Jack's infidelity throw a wrench into their romance, however. Finally there is Stephanie, played by Payne's then wife Sandra Oh. She is the least developed of these main characters, but we know enough about her that she doesn't seem unnecessary to the story. She plays a wine server at a winery the guys visit early on. She and jack are immediately attracted to each other, and of course Jack's upcoming marriage is not revealed until after things have gone too far between them.Sideways is wonderfully acted, and deserves all of the critical acclaim it received. Like other Payne films, it sucks you in by creating interesting characters, then shocks you by having them do some completely unexpected things. There is much talk of wine, but fear not. You do not need to know much about it to follow the story. The film is shot with the background objects in soft-focus. Probably since the characters are often under the influence, this is how their world looks to them. As with Payne's previous film About Schmidt, there is a ghastly scene of unexpected nudity.Sideways will be a tough film to top for Alexander Payne, but he shouldn't let that stop him from trying. Another film from him in the near future would be greatly appreciated. 10 of 10 stars.The Hound.",Sideways

The film is about Miles Raymond, a depressed man in his 40's who recently got divorced and works at a high school as an English teacher. Miles is also obsessed with wine and everything about it from the look to the taste and smell of it. He has also currently wrote a book and is trying to get it published. Miles' best friend is Jack, who is a loud, crude and confident man in his 40's who is an actor and will be getting married in a week to a woman named Christine. Before he gets married Miles, and Jack plan to go on a road trip for a week to taste different wines and relax. Along the way Jack meets and gets a crush on a woman who works at a wine shop named Stephanie and she seems to like Jack a lot too. Miles is introduced to a waitress named Maya, who seems to like him but Miles is hesitant and nervous.

Sideways, has good direction, a good script, great performances by everyone involved, good original music, good cinematography, good film editing and good set decoration. Sideways, is directed by Alexander Payne who brought us Election (one of my favourite films from 1999) and About Schmidt (one of my favourite films from 2002) but Sideways isn't as good as these other two films. I thought the film was very well made in every way and we have some great performances here and there is some great character development here and funny stuff does happen but a lot of the time nothing happens and the film feels long and gets quite dull for awhile. I think the film is good but mostly because of the acting and behind the scenes work. I would've liked more to have happened in the screenplay and I would have liked to have been affected more by these characters. The film was still OK so I'll give it a recommendation but I think it is very overrated and a disappointment compared to Alexander Payne's other films.",Sideways
112,gregsrants,One of the Best of the Year,9,21 November 2004,"I am betting that the average once a month moviegoer wouldn't recognize the name Paul Giamatti. In fact, to put my theory to the test, I tried it at work and asked around the water cooler to see who might identify a face to the name. Five people into my study  nothing. So I took it to the next level and began to give them hints. Planet of the Apes, The Negotiator, Saving Private Ryan, American Splendor. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Blank stares. Hmmmm. Confidence, Big Fat Liar, Big Momma's House, I continued. Nope, nope and nope. The words 'Pig Vomit' (the name that Howard Stern gave to the Giamatti portrayed character in Private Parts) did seem to increase the odd eye pupil size, but I can put the lab coat back on the rack and conclude that Paul Giamatti is not yet a household name. Not yet.Paul Giamatti is a bit actor that is beginning to get recognized with the big boys. He has held his own alongside such talent as Tom Hanks, Samuel L. Jackson and (dare I put him into the same category) Mark Wahlberg. He had the best lines in Private Parts and The Negotiator and received raves for his role as Harvey Pekar in 2003's delightful American Splendor. His performances have nabbed him nominations with the Independent Spirit Awards, the National Board of Review and even with the Blockbuster Entertainment Awards back in 2001. He may not be known therefore to Joe-Q public, but with already over 30 film roles on his resume; it is only a matter of time before the face and the name ring a bell.It came as no surprise to this writer therefore when director Alexander Payne (About Schmidt, Election) picked Giamatti as the lead in his new buddy road flick, Sideways. The movie centers around two men, Jack (Thomas Haden Church of TV's Wings' fame) and Miles (Giamatti) who set out for one week of wine tasting in California before Jack gets married on Saturday. It becomes clear early on that their intentions for the trip are polar opposites. Jack is an actor who is questioning his decision to marry and is looking for one last weekend of fun and frolicking with the opposite sex. Miles is a true wine connoisseur, who knows his wine lists intimately. From the grapes on the vine to the color in the glass, Miles relishes in his passion and wants nothing more than a week of tasting good wines over good conversation. It takes to all of day two before the two begin to go their separate ways. Jack falls for Stephanie (Sandra Oh), a server at one of the wine distillers and he tries desperately to get Miles included by double dating with Stephanie's friend Maya (Virginia Madsen), a waitress at the local restaurant that Miles frequents. After a dinner for four that beings to tailspin with Miles' overdrinking, the two couples break away to their comfort zones  the wine rack for Miles and Maya and the bedroom for Jack and Stephanie. The next few days will see the two friends barely having enough time to talk between their budding and bugling relationships with the two women. The movie primarily plays to the Maya and Miles storyline. Both characters have recently been divorced and they share a chemistry over their appreciation for good wines. Neither seems ready to jump back into the relationship mode just yet, but their fascination for each other  Maya at Miles' attempts to be a published author and Miles at Maya just for showing interest  makes for an incredibly effective romance. Both relationships happen to dissolve quicker than an Alka-Seltzer tablet in a glass of water once Miles accidentally slips loose the secret that Jack is set to be married on the weekend. Maya becomes enraged at Miles for keeping this startling bit of information from the women and Stephanie goes on a ballistic assault with her motorcycle helmet on Jacks face once she is told of Jack's fiancée in waiting. The concluding chapters deal with both men trying to cope with their female loss while trying to find a future path worth taking.Director Alexander Payne is a fresh breath of Hollywood talent like Wes Anderson. Paul Thomas Anderson and David Gordon Green. He uses strong character development instead of explosions and space aliens to provide us with an interesting story that we wish wouldn't end. His casting choices in Sideways were perfect. Giamatti should see a nomination early next year if justice prevails and bringing Haden Church into the fold having nothing more than direct to video fare in the new millennium was also a coup. Having us completely forget that he was ever the dimwitted Lowell on 1990's television Wings, he too provides enough charisma and confidence to be deserving of honorable mention at statue time.The two female leads also provide strong support, with Oh (Anderson's wife by the way) making the most of her limited screen time and Madsen giving her best performance in years as someone who was recently hurt in love and wants to take their time getting back in the dating game. She is the glue that holds the story together even when she is not on screen and her reactions that lead to the films final scene are believable and not overwrought. I can't argue that that Sideways won't appease the 'something-has-got-to-happen-every-minute-to-keep-my-interest' gang, but those that want a character driven story with strong leads and interesting people, you can't do better this year. Watch for this one to end up on many best of lists in a few weeks. www.gregsrants.com",Sideways
113,Rogue-32,Miles Raymond - to pinot him is to love him,9,1 November 2004,"Paul Giamatti has come a long way from when he took a serious back seat to Howard Stern in Private Parts as ""Pig Vomit"" (and of course he stole the film, as he always did, in all his pre-starring-role character parts). But yes, Virginia, there is a God, and now he's finally being allowed to come into his own, as one of the most unconventional leading men in the history of the cinema, much to my unabashed and thoroughly supreme delight.He ruled in Duets, he stole the show as a one-person blue man group in Big Fat Liar, and he successfully carried American Splendor, as underground comic writer Harvey Pekar, and he does it again, to even more brilliant effect, in Sideways, where he plays the disgruntled, depressed Miles one-whiff-away-from-being-a-wino Raymond, and nobody working in films today is better at this kind of characterization - a person who's gradually being pushed to his limit, from within and without, slowly but surely pressed to the breaking point, and you know that the moment when he finally snaps is going to be a payoff-and-a-half. We are treated to such a payoff scene in Sideways - we're treated to that scene and much, much more, thanks to a near-perfect script and beautiful direction, from a director who truly understand Giamatti's most extraordinary gifts.His co-stars shine as well - Thomas Haden Church (as his desperate soon-to-be-married actor friend, Jack), Sandra Oh (as the woman Jack chooses to have his last-week-as-a-bachelor fling with), and the wonderful Virginia Madsen, glowingly radiant as she's ever been as the soulful Maya.

114,cchase,Selling No WHINE Before Its Prime...,10,11 July 2005,"Alexander Payne shares a lot of similarities with Woody Allen, as both directors display a begrudging affection for the misfits, losers and ne'er-do-wells that people their films, 'stum-fumbling' their way through their lives and loves as mere mortals are wont to do. The difference between the two? Where Allen's heavy-handed self-indulgence relegates him to what many feel is an acquired taste category, Payne has an uncanny sense of knowing exactly when to get the hell out of his own way and the way of his characters, giving them breathing room to spare to tell their stories in their own unique voices, so that they are endearing to our hearts even as they grate on our nerves.Nowhere has this director's talent been displayed more artfully than in the bittersweet comic gem SIDEWAYS, one of the best films made for grown-ups in many, many moons. And when you are talking about the same guy who gave us CITIZEN RUTH, ELECTION and ABOUT SCHMIDT, this is something of a remarkable achievement.Miles Raymond, (Paul Giamatti in a performance that was tellingly not nominated for an Oscar when it should've been) is one miserable, hangdog wreck of a human being. Still nursing the scars from a failed marriage that ended badly two years ago, the emotional damage stains the fiber of his very being like residue from splashes of battery acid. There are exactly two things that manage to preserve some desire for him to maintain meaningful human connection: the earnest and provocative novel he has poured his guts into for a year longer than the hiatus from his marriage, and his deeply obvious love for wine and all that goes with it.Well, make that three things, if you include his old college chum, Jack, a fading soap actor and incorrigible Lothario, (Thomas Haden Church finding new dimensions of the type of cad he usually inhabits). Jack is so afraid of commitment, aging and his impending nuptials to a comely Armenian lass, that he's exhibiting enough symptoms of ""Peter Pan"" syndrome to make Michael Jackson want to bitch-slap him.Instead of a wild, garter-snapping, beer-vomiting bacchanal, Miles has another plan for his maturity-challenged buddy: to send him off to married bliss in style, taking him on a week-long, ""me-and-thee"" excursion of the gorgeous California vineyards, hoping that a taste of the finer things in life will curb some of Jack's adolescent ardor. Fat chance, Mr. Raymond. Jack is fully determined to turn this trip into a travelogue of wine, women and SCHWING! (As in golf and the other kind.) And he succeeds beautifully, but not in the way that either man expected.Where the flirtatious Jack hooks up with a winsome wine-pourer named Stephanie (Sandra Oh, who exhibits a finely-tuned balance of wanton yet playful sexuality that gives her an earthy glow), Miles frets and sweats under the attentions of the comely Maya (Virginia Madsen) a waitress at a local winery for whom he has carried unrequited feelings for some time. If any moviegoer needed evidence that Hollywood has long had its head up its you-know-what where good female roles are concerned, they would only need to observe the stunning, natural performance that Madsen gives here. Even Ray Charles would've known that this actor rightly deserved the accolades and the nomination she received.Filled with gentle, knowing but not archly self-reverent humor, heartbreak and the deepening of wisdom that comes with inescapable self-knowledge, (well, at least for SOME of the characters), not enough can be said about the exquisite writing done by Payne with Jim Taylor, based on Rex Pickett's once-unpublished novel (worthy of yet another nomination).You don't have to know squat about vineyards or have a 'nose' for a fine Cabernet to recognize the fitting metaphor drawn here between wine and the people who drink it.Giamatti, with his everyman's slouch and Keatonesque expressiveness proves why he is one of our more underrated character actors, and a perfect match for the radiance of the stunning Madsen. This viewer was almost moved to tears by a soliloquy about pinot noir delivered by him to her, which is as deep and soulful an expression of yearning and loneliness as anything you'd find in the classics.With scenery shot in burnished tones by Phedon Papamichael and Payne's even-handed guidance, the whole creative team in front of and behind the camera deserves a big, warm bearhug for delivering such a rare cinematic gem. As you can probably tell, this one can't be recommended highly enough, to movie lovers, wine lovers, or lovers everywhere, for that matter.",Sideways

Sandra Oh is the women Hayden falls for and whose heart he breaks. The men are interesting. Giamatti is still in love with his ex wife who he finds out has remarried. His book is rejected, and he wonders if he is ""a smear of excrement surging out to sea"". When he describes why he loves Pinot, I understood wine for the first time. Madden is the woman who reads his manuscript and calls him to encourage more writing. His scene teaching shows how that is where he belongs. Both men express their confusion with what they want and who they are. The complexity in both characters is accepted by both, and that is why they are friends.",Sideways
116,agmoldham,This is what middle age is about,6,2 March 2005,"I'm roughly the same age as the middle aged principal characters in this film. I've got to say that I can therefore identify with quite a lot of their attitudes and character traits. Miles (Giamatti) and Jack (Church) head off on a wine tasting holiday in California the week before Jack is due to be married. It's difficult to identify who is the most disturbed since they occupy either ends of the shallow/deep spectrum.The dialogue and pace of the film are both spot on and the line about excrement has got to be one of my favourite movie lines of recent times. I've liked Giamatti ever since his roles in Truman and Man on the Moon and hopefully this will see him given more opportunities in the lead role. If you want to see an intelligent film with good acting, interesting characters and a whimsical story go and see Sideways. 8/10",Sideways
117,Danusha_Goska,"Finally, A Film As Good As Critics Say It Is",8,10 February 2005,"""Sideways"" has received so many excellent reviews that for me to write one more excellent review of it seems redundant.But, the movie was so good, I can't help myself. I have to add my ""Hosanna"" to the chorus of ""Hosannas."" And tell you why my ""thumbs up"" on this picture might be a bit different.I knew, and you probably know, that this movie is about two middle-aged, white-collar, white guys going through mid-life crises.Movies like that have their audience, and I am not in that audience. I'm not a big fan of ""whiney white guy"" art.But, man, this movie does what it does so excellently that I was in the palm of the filmmaker's hand almost from start to almost the finish.The beginning, I thought, was a bit redundant, telling us already something we'd find out while watching the movie. And the ending was a bit Hollywood for me.But the other 90 % was some of the very best film-making I've ever seen. Everything about this film was superlative. The casting was just *perfect.* I believe that I could have walked out of the theater and met any of the four leads, and the minor characters as well, exactly as depicted on screen, in exactly the clothing they wore, driving those cars, etc.One character's mother is on screen for a few brief moments, and the actress who plays her is so good she could carry a movie devoted to her alone.Thomas Hayden Church, Sandra Oh, and Virginia Madsen make fools of filmmakers who have not been using them extensively before this.Paul Giamatti, though, really took my breath away. I dreaded watching a movie with him as the lead. I just, frankly, find him hard to look at.But Giamatti is so good here, so, minute-by-minute, frame-by-frame intelligent and moving and courageous and powerful, that I just surrendered and gave my full attention, respect and emotional involvement to him. And was glad to do so.The dynamic between his character, Miles, a man with more intelligence and talent than the world cares to make use of, and Jack, a narcissistic, fading, pretty-boy actor, is ... maybe unlike anything I've seen in a mainstream movie.The occasional, and powerful, film can capture energy like this between two characters who are having sex with each other.Wait -- Peter O'Toole and Richard Burton in ""Becket."" Very different movie, very different actors, but, as with ""Becket,"" in ""Sideways"" you learn so much about these two men by seeing them interact with each other that you would never learn by seeing them alone or with someone else.""Sideways"" makes wonderful, mind- and soul- stretching use of what film can do. It is sharp and painful and funny and then funny again and then so funny you practically fall out of your seat, and you know you're watching a coupla losers with a capital ""L"" skid toward oblivion, and you are *laughing* and admiring the scriptwriter, the actors, the costumers, the set designers who got those *just perfect* smudges of putty on a living room wall, the timing that brought up images of George Bush and Donald Rumsfeld at just the right moment, the *everything.* Oh, just go see the movie. And then tell me how much you liked it.One last note. I did not care for the ending. I didn't leave this movie having a lot of hope for the future of its main characters. And that was *okay.* Someone said to me once that movies that depress her are not sad movies, but badly made movies. The themes of this movie are pretty damn sad. I didn't leave the theater feeling sad, though. I felt what I feel when I am lucky enough to be exposed to fine art. I felt that our human minds and souls can create meaning out of several kinds of hell, and films like this are proof of that.That is uplift enough, for me.",Sideways
118,TheNorthernMonkee,a masterpiece,10,28 January 2005,"SPOILERS In 2002, Alexander Payne, a relative beginner in the world of Hollywood, wrote and directed the amazing, albeit depressing, ""About Schmidt"". Weaving a tale about a man who you connect to on a high level and feel at one with, Payne's film was sublime.Two years later therefore, and Payne is at it once more. Adapting Rex Pickett's novel, he has brought to the screen a story of a man with a love of wine and a sense of loathing for life. This story, ""Sideways"" is beautifully told, in wonderful settings and with performances which will undeserved fail to sweep the boards at the Oscars.Paul Giamatti is Miles Raymond. Miles has been divorced for two years and has been in a state of depression ever since. Spending his time teaching English, writing novels and tasting wine, Miles lives a fruitless life with little success. With one week until best friend Jack's (Thomas Haden Church) wedding though, Miles (who is the best man) picks up his friend and they set off on a week of wine tasting, golf and fun. On this journey they'll drink wine, they'll meet women (the amazing Virginia Madsen and Sandra Oh) and they'll learn a lot about themselves.With 2005's Oscars just around the corner, in the British papers there has been a lot written about this film. With both The Independent and The Times giving it five stars, it could have been easy to have been expecting more than you could possibly see. Amazingly though, ""Sideways"" deserves all the praise it could ever receive.Set in the wine tasting region of California, this film is set in a truly beautiful environment. With glorious sunshine and exquisite greenery everywhere, the area is presented as an almost heavenly ideal where people will live happily together. It's strangely amusing then that so many of the characters in this film are miserable.Giamatti as our melancholy hero is absolutely jaw dropping. Portraying Miles as a depressive with a long history of sadness, Giamatti and director Payne have us connecting with Miles from the very first instant. Miles is a man who people love to be with, but who doesn't want to be with himself. He views negativity in everything and he hates life. Good things might come up on a plate for him, but he never notices. Madsen's Maya is devoted to him from the second she appears on screen, but by the time he gets his act into gear and actually does anything, you begin to suspect that the moment has passed. When he visits his mother as well, the characters does an awful deed, but as we watch him, we know how much he detests himself for doing it. This is the beauty of Giamatti's acting. He gets a character who it is easy to feel sorry for, and he makes us bond with the character on another level. It should be Giamatti's Oscar in 2005, but without even a nomination, we already have the first major injustice of the award season.One comfort which Giamatti can be pleased about is that the film itself does receive Oscars. With supporting nominations for the superb Haden Church and Madsen, the film receives acting plaudits. Most importantly though, it has also been nominated for Oscars in Direction, Script and the Best Film Prize itself. If there is any justice in Hollywood, it would win all three.""Sideways"" is a film people will be talking about for years. Often funny, always moving, the film is a masterpiece. Well thought out and well directed, it locks on the audience from the offset, and never relents until the final moments. A film for the ages, and an award winner of unspeakable quality. Watch this film!",Sideways
119,FilmOtaku,Another fantastic film from Payne,9,12 December 2004,"Possible Spoilers'I'm a fingerprint on the window of a skyscraper' is a line uttered by Miles Raymond in the film 'Sideways'. Lines like this one are only part of what makes this film such a fantastic one. Directed by Alexander Payne and starring Paul Giamatti, Thomas Haden Church, Sandra Oh and Virginia Madsen, the film follows a journey through California's wine country, a last hurrah that Miles (Giamatti) is throwing for Jack (Church) in honor of his last week of non-married bliss. It is clear soon enough however, that their agendas are completely different. Miles, an English teacher and failed writer wants to get away and get absorbed in wine culture, something he is an accomplished student of, and Jack simply wants to get away and get laid. The two agendas collide when along the way they meet two women, Maya (Madsen), a waitress at a restaurant that Miles frequents when he is in the area, and Stephanie (Oh) an employee at one of the wineries the two men attend. While Miles attempts to let Maya into his life, Jack and Stephanie are all over each other  but both men find that their inner demons and selves are hard to overcome.There are so many positive aspects of this film. Payne is a master at giving the audience intelligent discovery of a character. There is no exposition, unless it is something that would occur in a real dialogue. For example, we learn of Miles' divorce first from a short visit to his mother, but we don't know the extent of his emotional pain over it until a very short gaze at a wedding photograph on his mom's dresser. The script is simply wonderful, and the delivery of the lines by these extremely talented actors is first-rate. Payne has a very sharp eye when casting his films, and isn't afraid to twist and manipulate the actor into his vision, no matter how against type (see Jack Nicholson in 'About Schmidt') or how obscure (or forgotten) they may be. Thomas Haden Church is primarily known as the dolt from 'Wings', so to see him as an aging, washed-up male slut is amazing. Of every actor in the film, he is the one that surprised most of the people I talked to, because I think no one (but Payne, perhaps) knew he had it in him. Another surprise was Virginia Madsen. She brought a quiet, intelligent dignity to Maya, and after either seeing her in horrid D grade films for the last 15 years, it is great to see her in something like this. Sandra Oh is a well-established character actress, and showed both sensuality and vulnerability with her character of Stephanie. And Paul Giamatti  what can I say about this guy that hasn't already been said by the critics. He is hands-down one of the greatest actors on-screen now. I read that George Clooney was offered the part of Miles originally, something I can understand from what I know of Payne (giving him such a sad sack part is much like what he did for Nicholson in 'Schmidt') but I am delighted that Giamatti ended up with the role. He somehow manages to embody his character in a way that you can't imagine that Giamatti the actor is any different from the role he plays. Music and atmosphere play a large role in 'Sideways' as well. The jazz score is present more often than not, lending a breezy, yet animated tone to the film. The wine country they travel through in California is astounding, and 'Sideways' does for wine what 'Big Night' did for food. Not being a wine connoisseur myself, I sure wanted to be after the film. My boyfriend and I were actually commenting how we felt we learned a lot about wine during the film itself, and how while we couldn't have told the difference between one winery or another, we were able to spot the tacky one instantly, and this is a place I probably would have found 'charming' about an hour prior. The wine becomes an integral character in the film, as it lends itself to the action in ways ranging from aesthetic to torment and even defeat. 'Sideways' is probably not a film that is going to appeal to a mainstream crowd. Like two of his prior films, 'Election' and 'About Schmidt', they were both critical triumphs, but not entirely well-received by the average film-goer. 'Election' was too 'weird', with 'About Schmidt' people wanted to know what happened to Jack Nicholson, and I suppose a criticism of 'Sideways' is that it could be 'too talky'. Films can most certainly be too talky, but when the script is as brilliant as this one is, and the lines are being delivered by talented actors under the direction of one of the most exciting directors of the 21st century? This wouldn't fit the criticism. Give this one a try - you might learn something about yourself, or in the very least, a little something about wine. 9/10--Shelly",Sideways
120,jpschapira,Special,7,20 July 2006,"What basically makes ""Sideways"" a good movie is that it is made with the best of the intentions, and with true love for film-making. Sometimes a director makes a film with his whole heart, but with the purpose of getting to a specific audience and make good money. Some of these films fail because they're not good enough; they fail in both ways: as a movie and in the box-office.But ""Sideways"" is different; it succeeds as a film and not in the box-office, but you could say that it didn't intend to. This is the type of picture made mostly for the pleasure and the joy; because the director is not the most known name in the industry, the actors are rarely seen in wide releases, the topic is peculiar, the screenplay is insightful and full of life.Basing it on a novel by Rex Pickett, director Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor co-wrote the screenplay, joining Miles (Paul Giamatti) and Jack (Thomas Haden Church) in a one-week trip before Jack gets married. It's so well written, because Miles and Jack are best friends, but when Miles, a writer, asks Jack about the new ending of his latest draft, Jack says: ""It's great; far better than the old one"", and Miles replies: ""There's no new ending"".However, their friendship remains, and they care for each other, as you can experience during the film. They get each other up when one of them is drunk, they give advice to each other, they do the dirty work when neededMiles loves wines and he is and expert on the subject; Jack doesn't know the first thing about it, but when his friend is teaching him how to try a wine, he pays attention, until he asks: ""When do we drink?"" It's so innocent and so funny.Being that the best plot line the screenplay deals with, Payne and Taylor also take the adult relationships issue to the screen. We are used to see young people falling in love, but when these characters experience the feelings, it hits you: the excitement of one of the couples, like if they were twenty years old; and the inexperience of the other, evidence of the wounds that come with the divorce and the loneliness.The performances take Payne and Taylor's writing into the flesh. The ""Sideways"" cast is special. Take Paul Giamatti; he played supporting roles in ""The Truman Show"" and ""The Man in the Moon"" with Jim Carrey, went to the independent side with ""Storytelling"", did something for the kids in ""Big Fat Liar"" (my one reason to see that film), took a shot with mystery in ""Confidence"" and achieved a praised performance in ""American Splendor"". Many will say he's playing the same role here in ""Sideways"", but he's very good, he deserves recognition; and when he was nominated for ""Cinderella Man"" I wanted him to win and I hadn't even seen the film (I still haven't).Thomas Haden Church, an actor that was never in the spotlight, directed a film and played some roles in comedies always below the radar, suddenly took a big step playing a normal individual that wants to have fun. His way of speaking, his manners and expressions are so funny that you spend the whole movie waiting for him to speak when he is not; if you get me. The same with Virginia Madsen; she's so great in her role as Maya, and she had never been in the common radar before; and after the success of the film, she didn't take advantage: she has only done ""Firewall"" and voice works. That shows ""Sideways"" is the film she wanted to be in and that is that; same to be said about Haden Church and Sandra Oh, who amuses me in ""Grey's Anatomy"".Director Alexander Payne is also special. A few number of films, and recognized for getting good things out of his actors. I didn't find ""About Sscmidt"" good, but Jack Nicholson's portrayal was fantastic as an old man traveling along the United States to see his daughter. Payne is shooting a movie called ""Nebraska"" about a trip to Nebraska, and ""Sideways"" also includes a road tripIt's obvious that he likes to direct in the road, and he is an expert in the matter. The sceneries, the route, the grapes, the wineEvery detail counts in his digital and measured direction.""Sideways"" is special; it's good, funny, moving: and it's done for the love.",Sideways

The four lead actors are excellent: especially Paul Giamatti and Sandra Oh. Very well directed by Alexander Payne. By the way, I thought that there was a lot of similitudes with ""About Schmidt"", another very good movie by Payne. ""Sideways"" is kind of a study in behavioral science, an essay on middle-age crisis. The movie is sometimes heartbreaking, sometimes hilarious.

However things start to slide for our would-be bridegroom and wine loving best friend.What have I learnt about life from watching movies? Moreover, what have I learnt about the movie version of life? Well for start if you do anything then -- as my mother would say ""your sins will find you out."" Thankfully life doesn't operate like that or only operates like that on a limited basis. The media world rarely travels any other path.This film is based on that well known device of having only one problem (based on a lie) and then the jokes keep flowing as regards the lies that have to follow. Because we all know one lie leads to another. It also follows the well known media formula of only women being fully grown up and grounded. Men being slightly overblown children who want to grab a cookie just before lunch.I praise this film for its setting (the wine country back roads of the USA) and I praise it for its casting of thirty-something people, but it is just an offbeat drift along the river that needs all the novelty it can get to hold together as a proper movie. Who really cares about wine? An upper-class drug that works just the same way as any alcohol in the wrong quantities -- indeed that is part of its appeal for some people.I like this movie and I praise it. The jokes keep coming and they are real jokes with two feet planted on the ground. Not the ""lets go and steal a train"" gags that American comic writers often go in for - under that old rule of bigger always been better. This revels in being small, light and offbeat.Sideways (the title is still a mystery to me -- it doesn't seem mentioned on screen) will remain a pleasant memory in the back of my mind. The only negative I can say is that I didn't really like anyone all that much, not even the women. They look like they have easy lives in nice places and what they get hot-and-bothered about doesn't mean anything to me or anyone else who has lost sleep over money or employment.However ket us leave on a positive note praising all involved -- especially the actors who play weak /flawed with gusto.

123,rebeljenn,"original story, flawed character film",4,10 May 2006,"'Sideways' is a bizarre take on the slice of life of two middle-aged men who are going through some disillusions with life. The two go on a journey through California's wine-making area just before one of their weddings. On their journey, they meet some interesting people and find themselves in some decisions that influence the way that they think. This is a bizarre twist of romance, comedy, and a realistic story about two people with real-life issues.This film was nominated for an Oscar, and it seems to have picked up a following of sorts. What this film has going for it is an original story that we can all relate to with a bizarre twist that keeps us guessing and seeing the characters as nothing other than humans with their weaknesses. Sometimes you love them and understand them, and sometimes you hate them; whatever the situation, you can relate to them and their feelings. What makes this film stand out is also what makes its downfall. I thought that the film was a slow in places, and it can seem slow because it is a film about characters and it is a real life situation, and real life is usually pretty boring.The cinematography was done well, but the highlight of the film is its ability to create human characters and scenarios that an audience can relate to.",Sideways

Miles got divorced two years ago, he's trying to get his book published and he knows wine like his own pocket. Jack on the other hand is getting married within a week, doesn't know much about wine although he loves the taste. These two guys sets off down California's ""wine-side"" and soon they get to know each other, and life, better...SIDEWAYS being a comedy and drifting elegantly into drama sometimes is without doubt one of 2004's most enjoying, cool and entertaining movies. It's so not Hollywood, but in the same time it doesn't take things to a new level, it's a very simple movie. Though SIDEWAYS' big hidden treasure possibly lies just there, it's so simple that you don't have to worry about much while watching it, just enjoy it. Here goes the Miles' character into great loops; being depressed and a bit worried about a lot of things, he tries making his buddy Jack realize that he is actually getting married, while Haden Church's character doesn't see the serious in much of it.So SIDEWAYS is elegant, it's smooth and it looks great; especially when we surf around in beautiful vineyards or whatever happens, it looks both realistic but elegant. It's a movie about life generally, all the way, no big things happening here except we get to know a couple of guys who really wants more out of life than just don't living it. Either's when it's serious drama, it's love in the picture or the pure fun of it (scenes when they get in trouble with golfers, tries making a fake-accident, getting wallet back...), SIDEWAYS works in ways that everybody should learn and enjoy.",Sideways
125,RJBurke1942,What  no ups and downs in this story? Perhaps so,7,29 April 2007,"For me, this is an unusual film because I was unfamiliar with all the cast  somehow, I'd missed all the movies or TV shows that the four main characters had appeared in to date. But, I'd seen About Schmidt (2002) and recalled Payne as the screenwriter for that fine movie; so, I was a little uncertain about this one, as I sat down to watch a few nights ago.It's different, no question...First up, if you're not interested in wine at all, then you'd better give this a miss because wine is not only a central talking point in this narrative, it's the glue that brings these four main characters together and the grapes themselves  particularly the Pinot noir  are very much a symbol for the existential angst suffered by Miles (Paul Giamatti), the almost failed writer who is desperately seeking recognition, and who laments to Maya (Virginia Madsen) about the similarity between nuturing a relationship and the difficulty of growing that most delicious Pinot grape.So from that brief intro, you'll understand why this narrative is very much a conversation piece, as the four characters begin the process of getting to know each other...But, let me back up a bit, first: the two men are on a road trip through the California wine fields. Miles is taking Jack (Thomas Haden Church) on a last fling before his marriage in seven days (a nice symbol, with religious connotations), during which Miles hopes to teach Jack a little bit about wine, have a few rounds of golf with him, and generally have a good time with his friend before Jack ties the knot. But, things don't turn out the way Miles wants, because Jack just wants to have that last fling with just about anybody who'll have him, something that Miles just can't seem to bring himself to do, no matter what...Hence, that mindset of Jack's leads to a number of (almost) predictable misadventures, and along the way, there are quite a few long discussions  and a lot of shouting at each other  about the important things in life, like marriage, loyalty, honesty, and doing the right thing. All of that gives rise to some of the best dialog I've heard for a long time, and some really genuine belly laughs from this reviewer.Being the type of narrative it is, however, you just know that there are only a certain number of ways that it can end. Predictably, Payne went for the upbeat and easy way out for Miles and Jack, and firmly reinforced the sanctity of the American way of marriage, divorce and the emptiness of daily life alone.But, along the way, I did learn a bit more about wine and the wine industry.I very much like films with strong and energetic dialog; and this one delivers. As a snapshot of how some view the difficulties of marital relationships, however, it's very lightweight, barely scratching the surface of such a complex issue. However, as a comedy, I guess that's how it should be...See it for that, for the great dialog and, for my money, the simply flawless acting from Church as the somewhat simple friend with a not so simple problem: to be a husband, or not to be a husband, that is the question.",Sideways

Such as 2002's About Schmidt, my favorite movie of his.Payne hasn't had a movie that has come even remotely bad. He did 1999's Election, which was awesome. So was 2002's About Schmidt.

Sideways, like all of Payne's films, is hilarious, tragic, real, and awesome. If you don't like this movie, then there is something wrong. My favorite film of Payne's, About Schmidt, shares the same qualities that this film does. This is one of my favorite movies of all time.Sideways:A+",Sideways
127,Isaac5855,"An offbeat character study with characters we shouldn't like, but we do anyway",9,23 July 2007,"SIDEWAYS is an offbeat but completely winning character study revolving around a quartet of quirky California folk who have a common interest: love of fine wine. The primary character here is a teacher and aspiring novelist named Miles (Paul Giamatti)who has a passion for wine and for literature and decides to take his best pal, Jack (Thomas Haden Church)on a road trip through California's wine country a week before he is to get married. On this trip Miles reconnects with an intelligent and free-spirited waitress (Virginia Madsen) while Jack has an affair with a quirky wine expert (Sandra Oh), which turns bad when she learns Jack is engaged. This original comedy drama has an intelligent and humorous screenplay by Alexander Payne (ELECTION)that earned an Oscar and features completely winning performances by its cast: Church and Madsen both received Oscar nominations for their charismatic turns here, but oddly, Paul Giamatti was overlooked for one of the most brilliant lead performances of the year as Miles, a rich and complex characterization that takes on new meaning with every viewing. These characters are not perfect and there is a lot of behavior glamorized here that shouldn't be (Miles stealing money from his mother, Jack sleeping with another woman a week before his wedding, Miles' constant drinking and driving), but Payne makes these characters so warm and engaging that you're able to forgive the behaviors somewhat and revel in the sophisticated dialog and on-target performances, especially Giamatti, who didn't even get a nomination, a real puzzler to me. The film also features exquisite photography of the California wine country, which is almost like a another character in the story and an inventive and jazzy musical score that fits the film perfectly. If you're fan of Payne or Woody Allen, you will love SIDEWAYS, which has that same loopy Woody sensibility that you can't help but get caught up in.",Sideways
128,bopdog,"A masterpiece! Moving and immensely entertaining. And significant, because its movie world asks the same questions as we do.",10,8 February 2005,"Given the misleading marketing and trailers for 'Sideways', I resisted seeing it... until it got a pile of Oscar nominations. And my local Cardiff cinema brought it out last week, so I had access to it. My earlier notions were soooo wrong! This movie is magnificent. It is rich, deep, and, rare in a 'meaningful' movie, it was exciting and lots of fun.Thomas Haden Church deserves his Oscar nomination. In past roles he played a smarmy guy so well, that prior to this I simply assumed he was a distasteful rotter in real life. A complete sleazoid. He could have reprized that characterization here, but he masterfully went far beyond the mere outlines of a shallow man. Amazingly, he brought a depth and richness to his character. He actually allowed us to understand what might be lurking underneath such a person. He made this character not just likable, but also lovable. I thoroughly understood how such a person could have a best friend, and how such a person could also have liaisons with so many women. That is, the character's charms and strong points were visible. The character's weak points were also made clear, and we could see they came from a complex and real human being, not just a cliché character type.Church's performance proved that clearly, he is an actor of the highest caliber, a true master. Sadly, as has been often remarked recently, his co-star and partner in the movie, Paul Giamatti, did not get an Oscar nomination. In this kind of voting, no one will ever know exactly why, of course--- one thing to keep in mind is that the voting numbers are kept secret. Giamatti could have been a scant one or two votes away in the secret vote tallies, and thus could have garnered significant respect and support (via the votes) for his role. We will never know, however. Same deal with Sandra Oh and Virginia Madsen. Both were brilliant, both gave lifetime performances. But only Madsen got the Oscar nom, when both deserved one.Such oversights, and they are not uncommon (consider Humphrey Bogart and Jim Carrey, for example), are unfortunate but unavoidable in the realm of human beings. Paul Giamatti and Sandra Oh can take heart, however--- perhaps their fellow Academy members will note the oversight, and will be favorably disposed to acknowledge future performances more promptly. Keep doing your amazing best, Dude and Dudess!A final comment on the overall vibe of 'Sideways': the movie is superficially a buddy movie, and a romance. True enough. But it works so well because it is much more than that. It transcends genre in a powerful way. It is about real human life. At least, it is about MY life, in way that engaged me, moved me, and ultimately uplifted me. I was touched and reached by this movie in a way that no number of 'Gladiator' or even 'A Beautiful Mind' type movies could do, as worthy as those movies are. Even, and I hesitate to say, the excellent and worthy 'Million Dollar Baby' was pretty abstract, when you think about it. It is unlikely that I would ever find myself in ANY of the dilemmas and situations depicted in those movies. But 'Sideways' was something I live daily, and it portrayed dilemmas and scenarios I confront daily. Not merely the superficial level of content and plot points, but the deeper aspect of the questions about life the characters as asking, and the answers they are seeking.'Sideways' is so good and so worthy and so masterful, maybe, in part, because it is ultimately about US. Its movie world seems to be asking the same questions we ask, and thus its journey is more meaningful than that taken by most films. I gave it a 10 out of 10, although if I were allowed, I'd give it an 11, and give Paul Giamatti and Sandra Oh Oscar nominations as well.",Sideways
129,PersianPlaya408,A great smart funny flick from Payne,10,27 August 2005,"Sideways is Alexander Payne's masterpiece. A drama/comedy that is both intellectually interesting and very funny. With great performances, smart direction and a great Payne script, this film is perfect. Giamatti is perfectly cast and does a great job here, my favorite of the film (although the academy only gave nods to Church and Madsen). I thought the whole cast was good, even the director's wife (soon to be divorced), Sandra oh, who was very believable as a liberal swinger chick. I also loved Thomas Haden church, who is very believable as a television actor, it sort of fit him for me since I was actually used to seeing him on TV show Wings. Virginia Madsen was also great, and in my opinion gives an Oscar worthy performance here. The film's script is great, good work from Payne and longtime collaborator Jim Taylor. Its the best part about the film, i mean i would have never thought I would be so interested in a film that had dialogues about winetasting and wine types throughout, but it worked. This film is perfect, an instant favorite of mine, 10/10 #60 on my list of all-time favorite films",Sideways
130,roedyg,for oenophiles only,3,13 December 2014,"This is the first film review I have ever written where I did not sit through the entire film. It was just too boring. Perhaps something interesting happens at the end, but you will have to wade through quite a bit of fluff.I saw a highly positive review years ago, and made a note to catch this film. I am quite baffled why the film would appeal to anyone other than lonely old divorced men, dreaming that some day they will nail a younger babe.For a movie to engage me, I have to care about at least one of the characters. They need not be heroic. They can be deeply flawed. Being funny is sufficient. Even being good looking is sufficient. However, none of the four characters in this movie gave me a hook.Miles (Paul Giamatti) is a pretentious wine snob who steals from his mother.Jack (Thomas Haden Church) reminds me of an over-the-hill Dick Casablancas frat-boy character in Veronica Mars who still pursues females with the mindset of beaver trapper crossed with a used car salesman.Maya (Virginia Madsen) is another wine snob.All of them are drunks in denial.Far too much screen time is devoted to nerdy wine snob talk (a game of one-upmanship) and the showing of expensive wine labels and the drinking of wine. I know that is the basic theme of the movie, but in itself, it holds almost no interest for me. We all know the glasses do not even contain actual wine, even if the bottles with the impressive labels possibly do.The movie might have worked, with a Woody Allen touch, playing it more for comedy.The dialogue is as inane and ad hoc as real life. Some of it sounds horribly familiar, as if it were cribbed from a self-help book.",Sideways
131,lawprof,"Wine, Women and Woe",9,6 November 2004,"[Minor spoilers ahead]One of 2004's best releases, director/scriptwriter Alexander Payne's ""Sideways"" MUST break out of the limited-screens world and make it to theaters all over. Inspired directing and terrific, occasionally haunting, acting combine to make a couple of hours just slip away.Set in Southern California, middle school English teacher and aspiring novelist, the recipient of many rejection letters, Miles Raymond (Paul Giamatti) takes his closest friend, Jack (Thomas Hayden Church) for a week of R&R before the latter's wedding to a beautiful young woman. An opening scene suggests - and the story later confirms - that Jack, an occasional TV actor now plying his trade doing commercial voice-overs, is definitely marrying up.Miles, divorced for two years and still emotionally on the ropes, is a dedicated wine connoisseur, knowledgeable but unpretentious. For the week's holiday they drive to vineyard country where Miles has been many times. Tasting different vintages and golf is Miles's goal for this buddy ""we may not be able to do this again soon"" foray. Jack has other ideas. A handsome man largely controlled by his penis rather than either his brain or his heart, he views the trip as a chance for a week long sex-laced bachelor party for two, one (him) if that's the way the cards fall.The guys meet two women through a winery visit, Stephanie (Sandra Oh) and Maya (Virginia Madsden). Maya is a divorcée, Stephanie is single with a little girl. Miles doesn't know how to start being single and available while Jack is experienced in forgetting his impending nuptials while laying on the charm (such as it is-I found his persona, well, disgusting). Jack also tells the women that Miles's novel has been accepted for publication and his friend haplessly accepts the lie.Pledged not to reveal Jack's deception, Miles tries to deal with his own attraction to Maya, a potential momentous release from therapy-supported, pill-popping crutches that allow him to function as an involuntarily single man.What makes ""Sideways"" work fabulously is the terrific acting of the four principals. Giamatti, not much competition for Jude Law, is an ""Everyman."" That is, an ""Everyman"" who finds it hard to accept that a love has been lost and whose grieving runs rampant past the time when it should abate. Giamatti is very believable, painfully so I suspect for many male viewers, and his special ability to telegraph feelings and moods through body language boosts his performance. Church plays Jack for laughs but many viewers will recognize a churlish, actually cruel, cad long before there's evidence to support the charge.Virginia Madsden is a very talented actress. Her Maya, like Miles, has been divorced for a few years but she has it together. With a well-developed love of wine and a willingness to move on, she's an engaging character. And then there's Sandra Oh, one of the few successful actresses of Korean ancestry. As Patti in ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" she was wrenchingly real as a pregnant woman abandoned by her lover. Here she's ready for happiness and unprepared for gross deception and cruel manipulation. Oh is a veteran actress but many of her movies are not well known. She's going to be in a lot more top drawer films since the Diane Lane hit and ""Sideways."" I hope.And, by the way, the scenery is great too.This is a true adult film in the best sense of the term. Alternately very funny and affectingly sad, Alexander Payne has crafted a first-rate movie. As he showed in 1996's ""Miss Liberty,"" he knows how to make his characters come alive. 9/10",Sideways
132,ThurstonHunger,I can laugh for Miles and Miles and...,7,19 December 2004,"Some of the comments here are funnier than the film itself, but for me ""Sideways"" was more or less enjoyable. Definitely one filled with cringe humor, which I enjoy but in its nature will prevent me from identifying with the characters.It does toy a bit with a theme I like, Miles having a secret self he can share with his love...but too often his superficial and fictional self get in the way, setting up the cringe for a moment when his real self emerges. Jack's man-as-a-penis is going to rub some people the wrong way.More sweet Payne (although ""About Schmidt"" didn't quite hit the fan for me), I'll look forward to seeing his ""Nebraska"" sooners or later... An Oscar for this would be a bit of a laugh though, and would sadly eclipse the ""Eternal Sunshine"" with a spotted wineglass.7/10",Sideways
133,movieguy1021,Sideways: 9/10,9,24 November 2004,"Alexander Payne has proved himself to be able to direct a variety of films in the same genre. Election was a satire made to look like a teen comedy, About Schmidt was an old-person-comes-to-terms movie, and Sideways is a mid-life crisis movie. All three are similar in theme, but especially Schmidt and Sideways. They're almost the same movie, with an age difference of about 20 years. Both juggle comedy and drama effectively, but Sideways is funnier, sadder, and hit closer to home than Schmidt did for me.Miles (Paul Giamatti) takes his friend Jack (Thomas Haden Church) off on a week-long road trip right before Jack's marriage to Christine (Alysia Reiner). Miles is a high school English teacher and a struggling writer who's still depressed about his divorce two years earlier. Jack is a formerly famous actor reduced to doing voice overs in car commercials. They travel north in California, into wine country, as Miles is a pretentious wine enthusiast. They meet Maya (Virginia Madsen) and Stephanie (Sandra Oh) up there, and respectively, Miles and Jack try to hit it off with them. Jack is more successful, which puts his marriage in jeopardy. They look at their lives while up there, as it puts the audience in various stages of laughter and tears.Sideways is obviously more personal to 43-year-old Payne than Schmidt or Election, and it shows. It bares the honest truth about humanity. Although Miles and Jack seem like completely total opposites, they're both the same on the inside-they're both Everymen. Payne deals with this in not only a mature manner, but also with a sympathetic eye. He doesn't allow Miles to become an down-and-out loser (like, say, Philip Seymour Hoffman in every movie he's in), nor does he allow Jack to be this total soul-less tail-chaser. The characters are unrealistic enough to have us believe that something like the movie could happen, but also grounded in reality. When movies try to have this down-to-earth ""realism"", they often fail. But since Sideways had characters who weren't like us (but we were able to relate to them), it made the movie easier to enjoy and like.It also helps that the movie is pretty damn funny. Due to Miles's pretentiousness re: wine, the movie mocks people like that, but also shows the ""different strokes for different folks"" approach-what Miles likes is different from what Jack likes, and neither can grasp that concept, leading into some very funny dialogue. I noticed that the audience laughed at times when the movie wasn't funny. Why that is, I don't know, but the movie is funny anyway. And something that I'm sure surprised much of the audience is the sex between two people who you normally wouldn't see having sex on films. I suppose it's like the ""shock"" of Kathy Bates in Schmidt, but I suppose it's almost brave of Payne to show these things on film, stuff that no one else would.Giamatti is simply spectacular in his trademark role of a schlub (see also: American Splendor). He expresses his emotions like a pro. Church is also pretty good, but I think the standout is Oh. She got the part from being married to Payne, but she does a breakout job here, and it seems like she has a lot of opportunities now to become a star along the ranks of Giamatti (Splendor really shot Giamatti up). All in all, Sideways is a great film-something for everyone. The soundtrack, too, is pretty great, one worth buying. I'd recommend it to anyone, really. For those who liked Schmidt, especially, it's a movie for them.My rating: 9/10Rated R for language, some strong sexual content and nudity.",Sideways
134,WriterDave,Payne Hits His Stride...,9,15 November 2004,"What at first glance this might seem like the slightest of Payne's films (essentially ""Sideways"" is a buddy/road comedy for the art-house set), is at closer look his most accomplished and entertaining film. ""Sideways,"" anchored by rock-solid performances, witty dialogue, and an unabashed love for wine and California, is laugh-out-loud funny and downright tear-jerking where Payne's previous films were simply quirky or poignant. Here we have Paul Giamanti in an Oscar-caliber performance as a failed novelist and wine enthusiast taking his goof-ball ex-soap opera actor friend (Thomas Haden Church in a comic gem of a role) on one last road trip before Church walks down the aisle. The men are at polar opposites of the standard male mid-life crisis, and when they reach sun-speckled and wine soaked northern California and meet up with two gorgeous woman (the subtly hilarious Sandra Oh and the aging like a fine wine Virginia Madsen in a dream of a come back role that should also be courting Oscar) hilarity, romance, drama, and coming of age ensue. It's all so damn entertaining because I never expected to learn so much about wine or to be treated to some of the best on screen chemistry amongst a foursome of actors this side of the 1970's. There's also one classic scene where Giamanti and Madsen, both a bit tipsy, are sitting out on the porch after a night of good food and good friends, sipping on some wine and they proceed to share with one another why they love the wine that they do and we see how it relates to their characters and people in general. It is in that scene that I fell in love with Virginia Madsen, with wine, and with ""Sideways"" all at once, and dare I say it is one of the all-time greatest scenes of acting chemistry, poetic dialogue, and subtle direction that has ever graced the screen. Yes, with all of Payne's films there are a few sidetracks the keep it from reaching sublime greatness, but for that scene alone all is forgiven, and it makes ""Sideways"" one the years best cinematic treats.",Sideways
135,Jithindurden,Must be a great film.,7,7 October 2018,I think if I knew more about wines I would've enjoyed this a lot more. There are a lot of things in this film that was so relatable yet the constant use of wine at every juncture made it a bit unrelatable. The scene at the restaurant where the protagonist goes to his dark place while everyone is enjoying themselves is the best moment for me. The characters and the relationships are so well written that I feel frustrated that I can't understand them completely because of this alien thing (for me) that comes in between.,Sideways
136,Antagonisten,Pleasant and entertaining,7,10 September 2005,"Existensialist movies are usually more or less about nothing. This movie is just that. An existentialist movie that depicts two middle-aged losers (in one way or another) doing more or less nothing.Sure, they drink a lot of wine, they date some women, have some sex, play some golf. Things happen, but still there is no real story and no real plot. The hard part is not making a movie about nothing, the hard part is making it work. So does it work? Actually yes it does.To me this movie was very much divided into two parts. The first part is slow-paced with quite subtle comedy, almost philosophical. The second part is more dark comedy and also more fast-paced. Both parts work i think and having this setup is a rather good thing since the slow pace could have made the movie rather dull if it had gone on the whole time.I'm no wine-fan myself and that talk didn't really impress me that much. Still this movie is more or less all metaphorical anyway and when it comes to sweeping statements about life put in the lingo of a wine-aficionado even someone like me can keep up. And also it's a funny movie, i found myself laughing out loud several times.I'm not going to join the crowd that cheer this movie on as the ""movie of the year"". I found this to be an enjoyable movie with a rather laid-back and nice style to it. I would like to see more movies like this one. Without pretenses and with it's main focus on being pleasant. But i also found this movie to be anything but spectacular, it's not one of those experiences where i feel i've seen something unique when the film stops rolling. It was entertaining and pleasant enough, but nothing more than that. I rate it 7/10 which coming from me is a good grade, to be considered a recommendation.",Sideways
137,Horror-yo,"Yeah, it's good",8,30 March 2017,"Where this easily could've just been a vain pseudo-intellectual production of intellectual masturbation for two hours with no plot, it actually surprises and has real substance to it.First of all, Paul Giamatti is excellent. He isn't 'very good', he's excellent. The opinion is not overblown, he simply acts every single moment out like it was totally real, but I mean, right down to the unimportant eye movement, eyebrow positioning...he conveys all the impressions that were so important for the lead character to do, throughout the whole film. This isn't a case of the lead actor carrying the film, as the film is very good in its own right, it's a matter of having picked exactly, but I mean exactly the right guy for the right job.They all do well, and Virginia Madsen has more to her ability than this mere role, but she plays it well, every actor delivers the right performance. Haden Church also good.I'll get it out of the way that the film is very well structured, not once do you get bored or complacent with it, it manages its tension superbly well, very good tempo and the events fit their place just well, not a scene too many...so as a more general commentary about the film beyond the technical/cinematographic aspects, this film does really well at being about a pretty uninteresting story really, a pretty used up topic, and doing it in a very particular way which itself brings meaning and purpose about. Not so many films have that flavor, their own atmosphere, their own scent. This one has that. You follow the adventure like you're there, in there, not like you're behind some computer screen watching actors play roles. The details depicted in this film with regards to relationship, to things brewing in one's mind...are so very realistic and subtle. The film gets a hold of you, and although there's plenty of immoral happening in the story, there are also meaningful wiser choices and an actual moral ultimately, one that spread its buds throughout the whole film and observes full bloom at the end in a very classy way (classy, like the rest of it).8.5/10.",Sideways
138,MichaelMargetis,One of the Greatest Indies You'll Ever See!,9,8 April 2005,"I saw 'Sideways' before it won any kind of awards. I could tell your right after I exited the movie theater, that it would be a major Oscar contender this past awards season. I wasn't wrong -- 'Sideways' took the Golden Globe Award for 'Best Picture (Comedy or Musical)' and was nominated for five Academy Awards and won one for Best Adapted Screenplay. 'Sideways' deserved all of this and a hell of a lot more. 'Sideways' is an extremely special movie that I predict will go down as a classic.'Sideways' was adapted from the amazing novel by Rex Pickett by the same name. The story is about two on-the-approach-of-middle-age men, Miles (Paul Giamatti) and Jack (Wings' Thomas Haden Church). Both are going through some form of a mid-life crisis, one more obvious -- Miles, and one more subdued -- Jack. Miles is a recent divorcée, wine enthusiast and struggling novelist trying to get his book published while working as an eighth grade public school English teacher. Jack is a washed-up soap opera actor now doing commercials for depression medication that's about to get married. Before the marriage, Miles takes Jack on a seven day road trip up to the wine country to celebrate Jack's last week of freedom. During the trip a lot of interesting situations approach them and their friendship to each other gets tested. During the road trip they meet a restaurant waitress, Maya (Virginia Madsen) and her wild motorcycle driving friend Stephanie (Arliss' Sandra Oh) who works at a winery. They hang out together and Miles and Maya start to hit it off, but there is one problem. Jack (who is about to get married) starts up a relationship with Stephanie that could tear apart his marriage and other people around him.'Sideways' is kind of a comedy-drama, like all of master filmmaker Alexander Payne's films (About Schmidt, Election., Citizen Ruth). It will probably appeal most to the middle-aged crowd then it will to teenagers or young adults. Everything in 'Sideways' is just about perfect. The acting in 'Sideways' is better than any movie released last year. Thomas Haden Church makes a most impressive comeback as Jack that was honored with an Academy Award Nomination. Virginia Madsen gives her very best screen performance as Maya, the complicated, beautiful love interest of Miles -- that should have won her an Oscar this year. Even Sandra Oh is pretty good in the precious few screen time she has. But, by a long shot the best performance of the film comes from the wonderful Paul Giamatti. He provides such a rich, frustrated and incredible character that it's hard to doubt Giamatti's brilliance as an actor despite films he's done like 'Big Momma's House' and 'Paycheck'. In this Giamatti shows everyone that he is not just that funny weird looking supporting character in goofy action films, but actually one of our generations most outstanding and prominent actors. Giamatti provides us with 2004's Greatest Male Performance that not only should have gotten him an Oscar nomination, but should have gotten him the actual award itself. Mark my words, one day Paul Giamatti will be recognized for his eminent work. Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor provide one of the best screenplays in recent years, and Payne does a fabulous job directing. The only faults of the film are perhaps being a tiny bit overlong and lagging at certain points. After that it's clear sailing. There are many humorous parts in 'Sideways' (most of which involve the great Thomas Haden Church) and there are an equal amount of deep emotional moments. It's the same perfect formula used in Payne's last film 'About Schimdt' which I enjoyed a tad better than this. Rolfe Kent provides a wonderful musical score and you can learn a substantial amount about wine by watching this film. 'Sideways' is a excellent picture and is not to be missed. It was just released on DVD this week and I'd highly recommend renting it. I'm pretty sure you won't be disappointed. Grade: A-MADE MY TOP 300 LIST AT #: 53 (#4 best film of 2004)",Sideways

But Sideways is a big disappointment.I didn't get the point of it, I thought the script was weak and superficial though it seemed it was supposed to deal with serious matters. The narration lacks dynamism and the plot unfolds badly, resulting in a boring, lengthy movie.The protagonists were too shallow and missed substance; the actors weren't that good (though it has to do with the characters I guess) and I felt they lacked emotions, therefore I wasn't able to connect with and care about them which is always a big flaw in a film.Bottom line is that Sideways' attempt to juggle between comedy, drama, and romance is mediocre at best.

Not knowing anything about movie distribution, I would nonetheless venture a guess that the commercial distributors underestimated the appeal of this wonderful, fresh and insightful film.I knew nothing about the movie when I watched it yesterday so these comments are made purely from what I saw on the screen. Payne crafted a wonderful movie full of truth, pathos and gentleness-a seemingly strange combination of adjectives but after viewing this movie I'm sure that the same collection of words will settle in your mind. The two male players are in turn: obnoxious, dumb, immature, conniving and pitiable in their mangled attempts to sort out life-paths. Here in Perth, our local excellent reviewer called the two guys life's losers; however, I remember them as just being average people caught up in average situations and, as with all of us, trying to make the best out of ever changing situations.The best movies leave you with little mental pictures of the richness of the story presented and this wonderful film left me with bags of delightful remembrances-human bits with which all of us relate.

The film was very well acted and certainly gave you a beautiful view of the wine country in California. One observation I had was how Virginia Madsen could be nominated for a best supporting actress in this film, when her part was a small one. Overall I think it was a different kind of story, of a man who was newly divorced and the trials and tribulations he and his cohort who was to be married the following weekend experienced as they sowed their wild oats in a week in the wine country.

144,moviemanMA,Sideways Soars,10,3 July 2005,"Miles Reynolds stares at his car that has just plunged into ditch off the side of the road. The look on his face isn't anger, surprise, but just a face that says I am so upset that I just don't care anymore.Paul Giamatti's character Miles is one of four great characters in Alexander Payne's Sideways. Along with Giamatti is Thomas Hayden Church as Jack, Miles freshman year roommate from San Diego State whose soap opera and commercial acting have left him feeling like he's ""the man"". This week is a way for the two to get away before Jack ties the knot with his wife to be Christine. Virginia Madsen plays the laid back, wine enthusiast friend of Miles named Maya and along with Maya is another grape vine fan named Stephanie who falls hard for Jack...and visa versa.While on the road tasting wine in California's sun painted wine country, Miles and Jack meet up with these two while tasting the vineyards. Jack is looking to score before the church bells chime and Miles wants no part of it. His divorce two years prior have left him scarred. As Stephanie and Jack hit it off, Maya and Miles slowly grow on each other. The two men's week of wining and dining is going along fabulous.What makes this movie so enjoyable is smart comedy that co-exists with a romantic element. Thomas Hayden Church steals the show with his lustful remarks and free spirit attitude towards life. He's always in pursuit of some action. The two who appear to be on opposite sides of the spectrum when it comes to having a good time, are often flung into situations that they must compromise and find a way out of.Giamatti's two films American Splendor and Sideways have made me think of him as the perfect ""Lonely Guy"". A man who can be funny when he wants to but is obviously miserable. His role as Jack is absolutely brilliant and easily could have been nominated for an Oscar. With a script that was well deserving of its Oscar, Sideways is a delight.Sideways is a movie that can be watched when you're in any mood because it has so much to offer. This is a great film that adults will love and young adults will grow to love and accept. Incredible acting, a script that kills, and overall greatness gives Sideways the edge it needs to survive.",Sideways
145,AvidClimber,A few laughters with serious matters worth your time,9,7 July 2013,"Sideways is truly looking at relationship sideways, and from two different point of view, a romantic one and a philandering one. The issues are not taken straight on, they are viewed from afar, judged by indirect actions and their consequences.The good. Well built, realistic, almost down to earth, and interesting story with lots of psychological details and some laughs. Excellent camera work and editing giving you a nice emotional perspective. Characters with depth. Perfect ending. Great panoramas. Solid acting.The actors. Paul Giamatti is in one of his best role, suits him admirably. I can't judge Thomas Haden Church, because I don't know him enough, but his performance was right on the dot. Virginia Madsen is great as the understated perfect chance. My favorite of the bunch, though, is Sandra Oh who serves us another one of her great interpretation, this time with a flair for very hot yet realistic sexiness.The bad. The neurotic behavior and a few extreme reactions to some events can get a bit much at time.The ugly. Nothing.The result. Everyone should see this. Perfect for those who are not looking for romance, but a relationship. You'll smile, you'll frown, you'll shake you head, but you'll appreciate.",Sideways
146,majikstl,Sideswiped...,4,24 January 2005,"A couple of college chums decide to go on a ""road trip."" One is a self-deprecating, self-loathing, self-absorbed, socially and sexually insecure bookworm/nebbish, still stinging from having been dumped; the other is a narcissistic, shallow womanizer. Their goal: drink alcohol and nail chicks. The nerd finds true love with a gorgeous woman, the lady's man gets his comeuppance for his wild and wicked ways. A lesson is learned by both: it's time to grow up.This is the plot of SIDEWAYS -- and maybe hundreds of other films aimed at audiences made up of teenage boys or those interested in soft-core porn. The only real difference between SIDEWAYS and all the rest of those superficial comedies is that the college chums in this case are a couple of decades past college graduation. And instead of heading to Florida for spring break and beach parties and beer kegs, these guys are heading to the California vineyards for a week of wine tasting. And this time the dorky best friend has been promoted to the lead role.The only real accomplishment of this film is that it has apparently successfully camouflaged its well-worn plot with a thin veneer of sophistication. But beer or wine, it's the same difference; SIDEWAYS is a tired tale with delusions of grandeur. Strip away the pretentious posturing and prattle about wine appreciation and the characters could just as easily be bar hopping and yakking about the perfect wave for surfing or the coolest cars for drag racing. Either way, alcohol is the doorway to casual sex with women of dubious morals and poor judgment.SIDEWAYS is at best a nice little movie. And, because there aren't very many movies out there that can be considered either nice or little, the critics went bananas over it. But nice and little doesn't necessarily mean great or even good. Or likable. Certainly the main characters aren't particularly appealing. Paul Giamatti's Miles is supposed to be endearing in his sad-sack, ne'er-do-well fashion, but in the end he is a self-deluding, pill-popping depressive, borderline alcoholic who hides behind an unconvincing facade of self-promoting intellectualism. Thomas Haden Church does have fun playing Jack, a past-his-prime, pretty-boy D-list actor who has just enough lingering fame to pick up waitresses for one-night stands. But when the film requires that he tearfully confess his genuine love for his fiancée, who he has been cheating on for days, the credibility just isn't there. Virginia Madsen and Sandra Oh, as the women who supposedly change their lives, are pretty plot contrivances and little else. None of these actors or their characters are intriguing enough to justify our interest.The film has been raved about as a film of wisdom and maturity. But, falling back on an almost mandatory wine metaphor, placing old grape juice into a new wine bottle does not a champagne make.",Sideways

Great photography of the wine country of California AND ONE GREAT FANTABULOUS SCENE:The actor has been revealed to his lady love of 2 nights as someone about to get married. He gets solace by seducing ANOTHER waitress. Her husband interrupts them while he is having intercourse with her in her anus. When the protagonist retrieves his wallet, the 'angry' husband is obviously enjoying his wife's dalliances by talking to her about the adultery scene, while also having intercourse with her in her anus. In the midst of all this corpulent fornication, the camera cuts away to the TV scene beaming over them from the dresser: George Bush and his Father.

149,dead47548,"If anyone orders merlot, I'm leaving.",9,10 May 2008,"A 'buddy film' in a unique way; the film starts off as a reunion of best friends Miles (Paul Giamatti) and Jack (Thomas Haden Church) for a one-on-one week long bachelor party before Jack gets married. Miles sees it as a week to tour the wine country and get some culture with his friend, while kicking back and relaxing. Jack sees this as his last opportunity to get wild, party and get laid. Miles already has a lot on his mind (he's semi-recently divorced and still incredibly depressed over it, he's sick of his life as a middle school English teacher and he's trying for the third time to get one of his books published) so Jack's abrasive, almost crude personality clashes with him from the start. However these two actors have such great chemistry that even when they're arguing, which happens frequently, that they are best friends.Throughout the trip, Jack drives Miles down into an even bigger depression. They meet Maya (Virginia Madsen) and Stephanie (Sandra Oh) and Jack hits it off with the latter, leaving Miles to mope around on his lost dreams. And just when him and Maya start getting very close, he accidentally lets news of Jack's upcoming marriage slip and all hell breaks loose. But it's in this moment, when the two of them are at their absolute rock bottom, that we see how close their bond is and Miles manages to pull out of it because of his love for his best friend. It's a very touching scene when Jack breaks down in their motel, pleading with Miles for help and telling him that his soon to be wife is the only thing he has in the world. I found Miles to be an incredibly relatable character and the way that Giamatti plays him is...beyond words. There's a scene where Miles explains to Maya why he loves pinot so much, and in the way Giamatti acts this scene we can see that he loves pinot because it reminds him so much of himself and what he wants out of life. It's heartbreaking, yet oddly uplifting in the same moment. Haden Church is also absolutely brilliant. The film has moments of extreme hilarity, but in the end it's a very touching character study of a man at his worst rising back to happiness.",Sideways

It's a downbeat idea with a couple of mildly risible moments, e.g. when the fussy schoolteacher character who at the outset steals money from his mother, has to creep into a flat and steal back his companion's wallet while two gross extras fornicate noisily. I think the audience is most fully involved when Canadian actress Sandra Oh smashes in the actor character's head with her motorcycle crash helmet. What she is really doing is venting her rage at the hugely corny happy ending that has now become inevitable. Weak actor WILL marry overbearing fiancée. Fussy schoolteacher WILL get back with wine expert girlfriend. Some viewers enjoyed the viticultural scenery of this picture. I felt a vast absence of the peasantry that once inhabited this environment, wearing folk costumes, singing and dancing traditional songs. People who belong to the land are sadly absent in California, which is why they make this kind of pointless road movie instead of masterpieces like Jean de Florette or My House in Umbria.",Sideways

The trip is supposed to be about wine, golf, and a good time, but Jack is too depressed due to the fact his life has gone nowhere. Meanwhile, Jack is only interested in having sex with as many women as possible before he gets married. Everything ends up going wrong, and that's when the humour comes in. This is a pretty good dramatic comedy, but I'm glad it didn't win best picture.This is quite possibly the most depressing comedy I've ever seen. In between all the funny scenes are scenes where Miles sits alone and depressed because his life sucks. However, the scenes that are funny are worth it. The humour is dry and sarcastic, so people who enjoy intelligent, witty humour will probably like this movie. The dialogue is very smart. The plot isn't too complex. Not a whole lot happens. However, its simplicity works. The movie doesn't need to have a whole lot of plot points to be enjoyable. The only thing that bothered me about the movie was how it is drawn out in some scenes. Also, the characters are still the same at the end of the movie. They've had no revelations, and they haven't improved anything.The acting is very good. Paul Giamatti is good at both the comedy and the drama portions of the movie. Thomas Haden Church is basically there for comic relief, and he's great at it.Overall, this is a pretty good movie that I'd recommend to anyone who likes smart comedies.

153,NoArrow,"Funny and at times touching, fueled by three great performances and characters",8,15 December 2004,"As of December 2004 ""Sideways"" has proved itself the movie of the year. Practically dominating the Golden Globes, AFI, Independent Spirit Awards, and a few others, it's a film loved by a good ninety-seven percent of those who see it. Now I'm not sure if I'd rate it above ""Ray"", ""The Passion of the Christ"", ""Spartan"" or ""Spider-Man""...and I know that I thought ""Collateral"", ""Kill Bill: Vol. 2"" and ""Napoleon Dynamite"" were, well, the astounding unique masterpieces of the year. Not to say that ""Sideways"" is overrated, though...just that it's been accepted with a bit of over-enthusiasm.Of course, it is a good drama and a great comedy, mostly about two middle-aged losers on vacation for a week before one marries. The first is Miles (Paul Giamatti), a colossal loser: awkward, divorced, inarticulate and with a huge obsession for wine that comes off as geekiness. The second is Jack (Thomas Haden Church), who comes off as cool and charming, but after you've spent a while with him you realize he's just a big, over-confident dimwit.The way I've described the characters doesn't really make them sound likable, I know, but they are, very much so. Miles is lovable in his quiet, sympathetic, always-failing way and Jack is a guilty pleasure, we find ourselves smiling maybe a bit too much as we see him cheating on his fiancée. Jack doesn't much realize his immoral behavior and constantly urges Miles to go along with it, while Miles just behaves in his regular awkward way. Some of the film's best laughs come from watching Haden Church's facial expressions as he watches Miles.The two meet a pair of girls: Maya (Virginia Madsen), who Miles has a sort of subtle crush on (subtle even to him) and Stephanie (Sandra Oh), who Jack lusts after the second he lays eyes on her. They go on a series of double dates, and Jack and Stephanie hastily delve into a shallow, physical relationship while Miles and Maya have a number of quiet, subtle conversations, mostly about wine. They are awkward, yes, most of the time, but the two have great chemistry and enjoy conversation, so we see that their relationship is infinitely stronger than Jack and Stephanie's.How the story goes on I won't say, only that it's very funny and at times very touching. The characters occasionally make decisions that we hate them for, but we forgive, and their wrong doings are usually hilarious anyway. The characters aren't bad, per say, even Jack has a moment of weakness where he realizes he'd ""!@#% up"".I won't spoil the laughs or the insights...just see it. I recommend. What I will say is that come Oscar night, writer-director Alexander Payne, Giamatti, Haden Church and Madsen will be recognized, or at least they should be, along with the film's cinematography. Madsen will win, too. She's magical and her presence is so beautifully subtle and gentle (that she's the sister of Michael Madsen is a huge surprise...though they both share that talent for memorable screen presence).The movie may not be as great as most say, but it's really, really close.

154,HelenMary,good enough and bad enough to drive you to drink,7,6 October 2012,"I love this film, and hate it because in parts it's difficult to watch as it's so close to the bone of an unraveling life. But really like it too, so that makes it all okay. The protagonist of the piece - anti-hero even as he's heavily flawed - is Paul Giamatti and he is simply brilliant in this against the perfect foil in the impeccably dreadful character played by Thomas Haden Church (who I'd only known previously from George of the Jungle!) This is not your usual Stag Do movie firstly because only two people are on it and secondly because only one of them wants the wine and women scenario and sadly enough that is the groom-to-be. The Best Man is the one who's planning a quiet romp - in an epicurean kind of way - through California's wine country.The two characters couldn't be further from each other in intention, personality or ego, and both are shown larger than life. As the story progresses, they become further apart, each finding a woman, each going their own way. Jack (Church) seems to be amoral, unfeeling and totally without a shred of human decency (opposite Sandra Oh as his love interest - she is very good, and brave, with a dazzling moped-helmet-thwacking-action!) and Miles (Giamatti) continues his mope about his failed writing career/marriage and his wine appreciation finding Maya (Virginia Madsen) who could be the postergirl for wine appreciation. In a very moving monologue Maya describes why she loves wine, the character of it, how it was made, and it did get me interested in wine! This is really a close-up portrait depression, midlife crisis and failed aspirations painted in the scenery of stunning California which watches in part almost like a tourist board advert. There are amazing moments of tenderness, friendship and clarity, beauty, set against chiaroscuro-like against anger, resentment, betrayal and hideous self-absorption. It really is a dark and light film. Not all it appears to be, and well worth the watch. Not recommended for people who don't care for bad language and gratuitous nudity. Giamatti is radiant in this, in a dark and depressing sort of way and it deserves its cult following and much-quoted-oneliner status. 7 1/2",Sideways
155,Okonh0wp,Made in the key of life,10,17 December 2006,"Sideways is a somber and highly engaging comedy that derives its humor from its strong footing in the tragedies and subsequent triumphs, however small they may be, in real life. Director Alexander Payne studied abroad in Europe in his youth and was heavily influenced by Italian neorealist films which shows through in his work. Instead of spending the film thinking about whether the story is well-made or not, you're pondering whether the characters are making the right choices or not because they're so real.Payne's last film, About Schmidt, was critically acclaimed because he was able to tone down Jack Nicholson. In contrast, he elevates the energy level of four character actors to get great performances. The film stars Thomas Haden Church as a brash playboy on the verge of marriage and Paul Giamatti, an introspective wannabe writer with severe self-esteem issues, as his best man. The two embark on a trip to Napa Wine Valley where they end up with potential flings in Sandra Oh as a raunchy single mom and Virginia Madsen as an intelligent and fragile waitress. It's a story that's relatable and touching.",Sideways

Your right, it has been done.Well made adaptation, that scores more for its ancillary qualities then for the meat and potatoes script and performances. Its beautifully shot, expertly in fact and the film will certainly go down as one of the wine industries most enduring and successful advertisements. (All these wine experts popping up like so many overnight fungi.) Even as it somehow survives repeated social and seismic earthquakes, California never fails to marvel as this magnificent almost divine sort of place, and I like that a film took the time to remind us of that. Payne sprinkles quite a few art museum exterior shots all meant to extol the virtues of Cally's landscape. He likewise gets all the interior shots done in a way that speaks of a garbage free, cool dark cedar paneled, expensive paradise that triggers total endorphins release.Well acted? Absolutely. Giamati is simply great, looks the part and is the part. The fact that he isn't even nominated reinforces a lot of my cynical musings regarding the so-called academy. Its a joke quite frankly. Madsen is great too, they all are.Unfortunately i remain a story driven critic and I don't think the film survives the microscope. In the first 15 minutes, you can size up whats happening, and whats going to happen, all the while hoping for the rest of the time they manage to keep it under 3 hours and that there will mercifully be some scooby snacks at least along the way. It doesn't quite turn out that way. In the end its formula, and its almost clinical political correctness frightens me, as if the final script were fed into a super-computer that analyzes and spits out the most palatable, Oscar potentialized version. Too many of the situations and plot turns were either just too gratuitously zany or altogether unbelievable, or and it kinda bugged me.The danger for a film like this is; the people who are not charmed by the wine country education, and the films other mostly visual qualities, are very likely to be seen shrugging their shoulders at the end and saying, ""Who cares?""",Sideways

I also like the more serious and angrier moments they exchange in.Jack is a typical nearing middle age man who can't leave behind his womanizing even long enough to stop himself from playing around a week before his wedding. That's not the funny part,the dark humor in Jack's character is that everything is all about ""him"",despite saying he's trying to help his buddy Miles. Also,the humor comes from his ultimate downfall when he sleeps with one woman too many and it truly costs him in the end.Miles on the other hand is a man at a loss to what his life is adding up too. He can't get anyone to publish his book,he's been divorced and depressed for two years and talks and deals in wine related topics and situations,instead of dealing with his life.The humor in the character is that he still pals around with a guy like Jack and again,his wine fixation. Especially in the scene before he & Jack enter the restaurant and he says,""I'm not drinking no (bleep!) Merlot! Almost like a kid who doesn't like spinach!The California/Wine Country backdrop is the perfect setting because it's a statement of how beautiful we grow up thinking life is until we get hit with the ultimate realities. Thomas Haden Church plays a sort of clueless man,in the sense that he doesn't see how his actions affect other people or even himself,as long as he gets his jollies. As for someone's comparison to his character from WINGS,you couldn't be more wrong. Lowell wouldn't cheat on his girlfriend before the wedding. Sandra Oh plays the unfortunate woman who falls for Jacks bull,thinking he's looking for something serious. (Of which he gave the overall impression saying he loves her). She gives Jack exactly what he deserves for playing with her feelings. That's ""not"" an easy role to play and is gut wrenching to watch.Paul Giamatti plays a man who thought had a clue or at least all the answers to life,only to have a series of rugs pulled out from under him. I can only guess he stays friends with Jack because he really has no one else to turn too.Enter Maya whom Miles has known just a waitress at the restaurant he eats at,when he travels north from San Diego. She's a wine devotee' to and recently divorced. Virginia Madsens performance is flawless here. She looks at Miles with longing eyes and you can actually feel what's going on between them. Despite Miles' hesitance. Overall,I can only guess the 333 people who didn't like this movie thought it would be a ""fall down funny"" comedy or maybe expected ""drunk"" humor. This is not just a comedy but a serio-comic look at real life. .....and if one can't understand that then you may not be at that stage of your life yet or maybe you think all movies are just an escapist diversion from reality.The reality is,there's plenty of grown men (and women) who are just like the characters presented here.

159,bobbobwhite,The Agony and the Ecstasy,9,15 November 2004,"What an interesting film for a basic buddy story filmed so many times in the past that we think it could never be filmed again interestingly. But, this film was so very interesting, as the wine twist was just what it needed to show that some things can still be crucially important to us even when the rest of our world is falling apart. The moronic buddy Jack personified all the dumb SoCal blond surfer dude airhead stereotypes ever made, as did Miles with his nearly pathetic loser nerd angst stereotype just one short step away from total breakdown. Both Church and Giamatti were wonderful and fresh in their roles, but I wondered throughout, ""do people put up with friends like these in real life as they did with each other in this film?"" Some probably do.I wouldn't, not even for a minute after the age of 20, but as both friends showed redeemable qualities at the end, others may have more patience in rooting out and helping those elusive good qualities that gave hope that they both wouldn't end up on the smelly detritus heap of life. They both often came so very close to ending up on the bottom of that offensive heap, that I was surprised that both did not in the end.The film was acted so very well by all four of the leads, and directed and edited so beautifully, that the essentially simple buddy story with the added kicker of wine gab was seen to be unique and fresh every minute. We all face many of the story's harsh relationship issues sometime in our lives, so we all can relate to them as our own but also enjoy that they were not ours as we watched these two friends, pushed by their inner demons, endure various levels of human suffering while enjoying the boundless complexities and allure of fine wine at the same time. Strange juxtaposition of agony and ecstasy, but it worked great here and showed what excellent writers, directors, actors, and editors can with a new take on a old story. This film also showed well, on many levels that we humans can be, with a bit of luck, great multi-taskers even when one task is nearly like death and the other one as rewarding as rebirth into a better person.The main thing that negative reviewers missed in this film was the great gift of hope it showed so well, even in the face of serious personal flaws and mistakes. The hope to change, the hope to be a better person, the hope to finally find and give love successfully, the hope not to fail in all of these things again. If some of us do not have or see in others this gift of hope, this most fundamental and necessary of life's gifts, they will view life's dynamic negatively through their own deficient perspective, never giving the benefit of the doubt that life can improve to the point where it can be lived well even by those sufferers needing the most improvement. The film made this tender point perhaps better than any in a long time, and was outstanding in its sensitive portrayal of all those flawed people desperately seeking a better life well lived.

(Let's put this to a scientific test and see how important a hill of beans actually is on the world scene, I bet it would make international news in the most countries....in the crazy news section....anyone from Heinz reading this?) Jack is getting married and Miles is pining over his divorce. They travel together to southern Cal for a wine tasting expedition and to celebrate Jack's last taste of freedom. There they drink wine and get involved with 2 lovely ladies.Is this really an interesting subject matter. The answer is, no, but it is filmed in a way that makes it an exciting journey, because it is about seeing the drama and humour in the everyday that make Alexander Payne such a genius (About Schmidt & Election both doing this as well).I guess I don't want to admit to identifying with the characters (being a middle class nobody myself) but I think the real joy is that everything is so ordinary but it also remains interesting.Don't expect much insight though, middle class drama repeats itself endlessly (like teen movies with less naked breasts).",Sideways
162,chron,"A Good Movie, but Not Quite Up to the Hype",7,25 April 2005,"This movie got a bunch of kudos, especially from the independent movie crowd. Paul Giamatti is an exceptional actor, so I had high hopes for this movie. Although it is an enjoyable movie, I think it failed to live up to the high expectations I had set for it.It's basically a buddy movie. Two guys go on a road trip through wine country before one gets married. The one that is engaged, is also looking for some ""fun"" before being tied down to a single woman. The other one is still suffering from a lost relationship and a failure to meet his professional expectations.The acting is well done and the direction is well done. There just isn't a lot of new territory that is covered here. The Paul Giamatti character is a slightly less neurotic version of the character that Woody Allen brought to the screen. The Paul Haden Church character is a classic self-absorbed man to never grew up. In a character-driven movie, the characters need to progress through their experiences portrayed in the movie. This movie accomplishes that.It's a good movie, no doubt, but I missed something that many of the critics did in asserting that this was an exceptional movie.",Sideways

To admit then, it was also the first time I first heard about this as well. Watched this over the weekend on the cable and kind of like it.Adapted from the novel by Rex Pickett, it tells the story of two friends Miles (Paul Giamatti) and Jack (Thomas Haden Church) spending time at the California's wine country, while trying to find the true meaning of themselves as men going through mid-life crisis. Miles is an author, while his friend Jack is an actor who often does voice-overs for commercials.Jack is actually going to walk down the aisle very soon and he asked for Miles to accompany him to go taste some wine, given he knows his friend is more knowledgeable than him. Along the way, the two men met people like the waitress of a restaurant that Miles often frequented - Maya (Virginia Madsen) and a wine pourer Stephanie (Sandra Oh).Men going through mid-life crisis, talking about women and wine at the same time.

In fact, ""getting drunk and crazy"" was the meaning of the book's title--a bit of private slang Miles and Jack use between themselves. The movie does have its funny moments, but Miles is unrelentingly morose throughout; there is no letup to his negativity. This is a high quality movie, but I think Payne went overboard in trying to make the story more believable and forgot that glimpses of joy are needed to give the pain more significance. I guess Payne decided to make a story about a clinically depressed alcoholic instead of a story with a clinically depressed alcoholic as it's main character. It's a valid choice, but not as involving for the audience. As in painting, a couple of light touches would have helped deepen the darks. Also, on a less significant note: perhaps I missed it, but was the term ""sideways"" uttered at any time by any character in the film?",Sideways
165,Greatornot,Sideways stands tall!,10,27 July 2009,"This movie was a perfect movie. It was not just about 2 men going on a drinking binge before one gets married. This movie explored the character of these 2 gents and the supporting female characters. What was beautiful about this movie is that it did not paint any one character as good or bad. For example, just when you think Miles is a pathetic, hapless loser that lets other people walk all over him, he will do something evil like steal something. Conversely when you feel that Jack is nothing but a womanizer , opportunist user he will stand up for his old friend Jack and actually show some loyalty.Thus, he was emotionally distraught over his 'wedding rings' as well, in one of many grand scenes.. This movie goes beyond a simple stupid , silly bachelor party movie.The characters, on the surface, seemed so simple, yet the genius of Alexander Payne, delves and explores the complexities, as well as the contradictory nature with in each characters psyche... Brilliant. Yes , it is artsy to be sure, but its about roads not taken, dreams not fulfilled and cornerstone moments and what may have been moments. We learn so much in the 2 hours , about the 4 main characters ,taking place in just one party week than you can ever expect in any other movie ever. A true movie of friendship yet betrayal, love yet love lost and most importantly a film about real people, exploring real emotions and having to deal with real consequences. Every character,flaws and all is likable and one can have empathy for each character as well. Great , The way Payne was able to pull this off. This movie is a true gem and I have seen it at least 10 times. Its that great of a movie and it is also the type of film that you can always pick up things you may have missed from previous viewings. Lots of symbolism,ironies and metaphors to look for. Some subtle and some not so subtle. Oh and by the way, the cast was absolute magic , especially Thomas Hayden Church and Paul Giammiti. Acting chemistry, as pronounced and as strong as it is in this film, between the 2 protagonists , only comes around about once in a decade or so , if at all.",Sideways

This is a highly superior comedy. The two leads --Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church are pure gold. The direction by Alexender Payne is pitch perfect. The script is almost criminally good. This is always highly amusing, and, when the big laughs arrive its very L.O.L. ---Giamatti and Church are as near perfection as you will get. They are simply the best comedy duo since Laurel and Hardy. The story is great, and its written with rich humour. The wine ""expert"" Miles goes on a week of fun with ex-college buddy Jack (who is getting married when they return..) What happens during their trip into ""wine making country"" is the stuff of great and intelligent cinema. Watch it....then watch it again. You will be amazed --on both occasions.

168,anhedonia,"An amusing bouquet, bold, yet unpretentious",8,20 December 2004,"At the core of Alexander Payne's charming road-movie sits a beautiful moment. Two oenophiles, Miles Raymond (Paul Giamatti) and Maya (Virginia Madsen), discuss their favorite wines. As Miles describes why he likes the pinot noir grape, Payne closes in on Madsen's lovely face and, in her eyes, you see her falling for Miles. And Maya's response is sublime.If Mike Nichols' ""Closer"" is this year's anti-romantic film, then ""Sideways"" might very well be the year's most romance- and love-affirming movie.The plot: Two friends, Miles and Jack (Thomas Haden Church), spend Jack's last week as a single man touring California wine country. There, they meet two women, Maya and Stephanie (Sandra Oh), and Jack decides being faithful to his fiancée is a breakable rule. This is about middle-age crises. Yet, Payne and Jim Taylor's script remarkably celebrates women. That these gorgeous creatures love us in spite of ourselves is truly one of life's wonderful mysteries.With just four feature films to his name, Payne has established himself as one of America's most novel filmmakers. With ""Sideways,"" he's crafted a film about adults for adults. The story unwinds at a leisurely pace. Nothing hurried, nothing forced. Like a good wine, Payne wants you to savor the precious moments, to appreciate what you're experiencing.The strength of ""Sideways"" lies in Payne and Taylor's ability to elicit sympathy out of two otherwise unsympathetic heroes - Miles, a misanthropic lug and aspiring novelist with a failed marriage; and Jack, fading actor who now does voice-overs for car and prescription pill ads on TV, a man-child who only seems to get more immature as the week wears on.Giamatti, unfairly overlooked for an Oscar nomination for his brilliant portrayal of Harvey Pekar in last year's ""American Splendor,"" surely deserves one for this one. He imbues Miles with such depth; when Miles laments he's too insignificant to commit suicide, we know exactly what he means and how he feels. His angst, frustration and anger are convincingly real.Church, best known for his role on TV's ""Wings,"" surprised me. I never would have thought he could hold my attention in a feature film. Although Jack is a heel, Church manages to find in him a semblance of humanity.The revelation in the film is, without a doubt, Madsen. Rarely has she looked this luminescent on screen. She's also never been this good in a movie. Then again, she's never had such a well-written, terrific role. Not only do I hope she gets an Oscar nod, but that this film revives her career. Madsen completely charms us with a superbly subtle performance. Watch her in the pinot noir scene and you'll realize Payne gets from this wonderful actress something no other director has been able to.For those of us who relished Payne's ""Election"" (1999), what's missing from ""Sideways"" is caustic humor. Not that this film isn't funny. The movie makes you smile, more than laugh out loud, though there's a hilarious scene involving Jack's wallet. Maybe it's a sign that Payne is softening as he enters his 40s. ""About Schmidt"" (2002) was much less sardonic than ""Election,"" which remains Payne's finest film, and ""Sideways"" is softer still. Payne's direction also seems a bit more conventional this time than in his previous films.""Sideways"" may not be Payne's best work. He set an awfully high standard with ""Election."" But it's still a very good movie. ""Sideways"" proves what a tremendous difference smart storytelling, terrific writing, interesting characters and outstanding performances make. Savor this sweet, unpretentious little film. It will delight, amuse and make you smile.",Sideways
169,ikanboy,A buddy movie with nobuddies.,8,18 December 2004,"This is a buddy movie with nobuddies. Paul Giamatti plays a pretentious English Lit teacher who would dearly like to be a successful highbrow novelist. He fancies himself as quite the wine connoisseur boring everyone in reach with his vino babble. He inhabits the role seamlessly. His only apparent friend is an old college roommate who's a failed actor. The two set out on a Stag week before the actor weds out of his social class. They go to Napa Valley so the teacher can enjoy his passion of wine tasting. Then their basic neuroses take over.The actor, Jack, played well by Thomas Haden Church, announces his intent to ""get laid."" At first this seems like a need to sow one last wild oat, but, alas, Jack is one of those men who uses sex to assuage his low self esteem, in other words he's an addict, and when he falls for his conquest, an engaging Sandra Oh, we realize that he's like many men: stuck in his adolescence. He's also not very bright or self aware. If he has an approving audience he's temporarily in love. If he's found out he takes it out on the nearest easiest woman victim.Meanwhile the teacher, Miles, avoids any relationships. We wonder if it's because he's still moping over his failed marriage, which is in part true. He is however acting out his ego dystonic narcissism. We see him stealing money from his aging mother so he can pay for the trip. When he learns his ex wife has remarried he carries on like a child deprived of a toy. And we see he's an alcoholic. He loves the grape and he abuses it when he's depressed. So now we have two addicts on a road trip.The boys end up with two women who are too good for them. Both women have had their share of faithless men. It's nice to see Virginia Madsen in a serious role again, but I can't quite see her paired with Giamatti! Sandra Oh is sexy and quite dangerous when she realizes she's been taken for a ride.Is this movie a downer? No, we find ourselves drawn to these two shlubs because in spite of their weaknesses they are kind of endearing. We all know people like this, hell many of us are people like this! Sure they inflict pain with their narcissism, but they get paid back. Sure they are shallow but they're aware of it on some level, one(Miles) more than the other. As in the Mike Nichols movie ""Closer"" these people are dysfunctional, but I prefer to be able to relate to characters rather than despise them and ""Sideways"" does a better job of making them believably human.In the end one of them seems to be headed off to a happy ending, but if you've been paying close attention you'll be able to predict he won't be able to make anyone else happy. Least of all Virginia Madsen! Of course with open ended endings like that we can fill in our own illusions. They're both wine fanatics and can talk to each other on the same level. But will Maya tire of Miles' self indulgence? Yes she'll nurture him up to his full potential",Sideways
170,tributarystu,He gets better in time,7,19 February 2005,"Alexander Payne. Yet to have reached a climax, but near to it with Sideways. And Sideways is all Payne. Splendid images with refined sound make up to one of the most beautiful movies in recent history. Visually, it's all but Schmidt's depressive world. But innerly, it's not that different.Payne is obviously fascinated by how people react in circumstances of great psychical breakdowns and encumbering temptations. He tries to dig deep into the soul to bear out the flaws which make us tick the way we do. Sideways is just another example of that, after his previous films. However, unlike ""About Schmidt"" which was a more excruciating experience to sit through, ""Sideways"" feels like a much better polished product. Yeah, it's about the misery of one sad, middle-aged bastard who goes on a week long trip with his best friend, a ""yet to have grown up"" adult. This race of people, the ""yet to have grown up"" adults, are probably the happiest yet saddest specimens to have walked the earth. They are so versatile in their lack of responsibility that they don't see the drama in it. They are the kind of people for who life doesn't deliver a ""higher purpose"". Well, as a matter of fact, that's how most people are - fate less - but some are less aware than others.Thomas Haden Church and Paul Giamatti are fairly good actors given the characters they stand for. However, none excels. What I actually find a bit troublesome is that, unless any changes occur in the future, Giamatti will be labeled as an actor for the intellectual depressed, which will make it hard for him to stand out while playing such a part. He's good at it, but I doubt true recognition will come between these walls. As for Haden, the character fits him like a glove. It's too bad the level of intensity at which he functions is a bit low. If you are familiar to Payne's previous efforts, Sideways will not blow you away, unless you truly admire this mythical word of the ""depressionist"". For my own self, Payne's style is still a bit too bleak, although Sideways is full of humorist moments. On the whole, the movie is a good piece and it does represent a step forward for its reputable director.",Sideways
171,Bob Pr.,"""Seinfeld"" like characters in a revealing narrative",9,24 November 2004,"Miles, the central character, uses his obsession with discovering the best of wine as a cloak to avoid considering how he treats others (and himself). His best friend from their earliest college days, Jack, uses his acting skills to pursue his obsession, bedding women, to avoid considering similar topics. Both show an easy, practiced adeptness in deceiving both themselves and others. Each is completely self-absorbed in his own pursuits and self-deceits.Neither one (IMO) is the kind of person most people would find to be pleasant company to spend two or three days alone with in a car on a long trip. But this tale of their week's journey together makes for a very interesting and often wryly funny tale -- the results of their pulls on the other to expand the other to their own preferred horizons and the aftermaths of that.Their story has much the same fascination and interest that made the ""Seinfeld"" series rated the best TV comedy for many years. ""Seinfeld"" had several story lines unfolding simultaneously and there's little of that here and much more of an exposition of character. If you really enjoyed ""Seinfeld,"" you'll probably do the same with this. If the way Jerry, George, Elaine, and Kramer treated others often made your skin crawl, this movie probably will, too.",Sideways

Maybe you have to be of a certain age to appreciate the crisis that the two main characters are going through. Or maybe it's just not for everyone. I personally do not believe its overrated. Instead I find it unique. One of it's best features is how it presents the mundane side of America. Its restaurants, its motels, its tourists. And it presents it without flashy photography or edits. In fact it appears to me that the director has gone out of his way to present things as banely as possible. I personally loved that. Then their is Miles and Jack. Both pathetic, but pathetic in different ways. I especially related to Miles who is morose and depressed concerning his life.
To be sure the film is clumsy in spots, and doesn't deliver every moment. But I do believe it was thoughtfully made, and yes quite funny at times.",Sideways
173,basrutten,Yawn-inducing,4,13 July 2006,"""Sideways"" is one of those movies that inexplicably gets nominated for numerous awards and even ends up winning some despite the fact that it's really nothing we haven't seen hundreds of times before, and often a lot better. Why? I have no idea. While it's a decently made movie, it has very little going for it.The first problem I have with ""Sideways"" is that's it billed as a comedy, while in reality the funny parts are few and far between. Granted, there are a couple of witty scenes in the second half of the movie, but labeling this a comedy is like labeling ""The Matrix"" a romance movie, or ""Mortal Kombat"" a musical.What ""Sideways"" really is, is a character study of two middle-aged men who go on a wine trip. As such, it's fairly successful: by and large, this is a fairly realistic depiction of what such a trip could be. The big problem is: why on earth should I care? Both of the main characters are totally unlikeable characters. They lie, they cheat, they constantly drive while drunk, etc. Again, this may be realistic but it's utterly annoying to watch, especially since you're supposed to care for them.The plot doesn't fare much better. It's awfully slow, awfully predictable (right up to the very forced happy end), and ultimately rather pointless.The only thing that could have still saved this movie are the dialogs. If they're sharp, intelligent, or witty, they can really redeem a movie like this. As you might have guessed, they are anything but that. Like everything else, they're lame, clichéd, and pretentious (all those discussions about wine as a metaphor for life....please).""Sideways"" is a well-shot, well-acted and generally well-made movie that is unfortunately about as funny as a Police Academy sequel, as fresh and surprising as an A-Team episode, and generally just dull and pointless.*1/2 out of *****",Sideways
174,ferdinand1932,Clever and well observed,8,12 January 2011,"This urbane comedy is understated enough to be almost an ironic documentary, 'if you will' to borrow Marti Di Bergi's phrase, of middle aged and middle class anxiety. The two anti-heroes crafted from Flaubert's last unfinished novel ""Bouvard and Pecuchet"", are without too many admirable features and mostly filled with the baser elements of humanity; and not a good reflection on humanity at that.There lies the irony in this well written film: that ambitions and hopes and dreams and the pompous presentations of success made for the benefit of others are funny, abject, absurd, and vain. Nonetheless, there is the hope of making a good life, of finding a partner, of being worth something. And all those desires in a world of nuance and grays and confusion.There are no, or very few, laugh out loud moments: it's a series of quiet laughs, sardonic laughs, experienced inside, as we see and perhaps even recognize moments taken from life. This type of story and style will perplex and confuse unsophisticated viewers trained on the identifiable and sympathetic characters of the movie industry. Some familiarity with twentieth century literature will reveal how much the anti-hero, the apparently hopeless slacker has inhabited writing.All the actors carry it well, the premise is just right; the entire piece moves at a good pace. The choice and playing of music is also a irony; that anodyne jazz is so much background and so much part of the whole wine tasting experience. The ending is a bit sweet and typical of a movie to close it that way, but not terrible considering the compromises that are normal.",Sideways

When the two friends go out for a week, I'm questioning myself how this movie can get funnier. But it can. The movie shows two ordinary guys, it could be you, it could be me. The relationships are not common like in all other movies, but it could be yours it could be mine.The fact that this movie could be real makes you believe, as a viewer, that what happens really is real. That is the strenght of the movie. It is very original. The actors and actresses were great.The ending however is not original. Where the second friend knocks on the door and the movie ends.

He is a reckless hedonist who gets himself into the kind of bad situations that make great stories afterward. Very manic Then there is Miles, expertly played by Paul Giamatti, who is dealing with his divorce from the woman he still loves. He is a sad sack who usually ends up being the one holding the coats while everyone else is having a good time. Beyond depressive.They take this journey through wine country, sort of a last gasp at bachelorhood for Jack.

177,Brogan,"Like fine wine, this film ages as beauty.",10,7 February 2005,"The first time I saw SIDEWAYS was in late October with most of the major critics from Phoenix, Arizona. I skipped work because I was going out of town when the evening screening was going to be on, and I have always enjoyed Alexander Payne's films. After watching the movie, I felt like I was on a enjoyable and exciting ride. I felt surprised and excited about watching this movie, and I immediately called all of my friends on my cellular and told them to, GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!Now four months later, and four viewings later, I still hold a enjoyable soft spot for SIDEWAYS, as being the best unexpected film I've seen in 2004, I had no idea what to expect with this film, and being one of the funniest films of all time! Not since ROYAL TENENBAUMS have I seen a comedy, where I keep laughing just as much the fourth time, as I did the first time.SIDEWAYS, is a simple tale, failed writer Miles Raymond (Paul Giamatti) decides to take his long time friend Jack (Thomas Hayden Church) out on a last fling to the California Wine Country before Jack gets married. Miles intention is to show Jack the awe and greatness that wine has to offer. Jack's intentions for the trip is to get laid as many times possible before he's married.Along the trip, Jack (and the viewer) is introduced to Maya (Virgina Madsen), a waitress at the Hitching Post, a restaurant that Miles visits enough to where Maya and Miles already know each other. Then at one of the wineries, Jack meets Stephanie (Sandra Oh) a sexually active single mom who is attracted to Jack, yet doesn't know about his marriage plans.From there on, the viewer, along with Miles and Jack, are taken for a enjoyable and unforgettable trip that is touching, depressing, exciting, and very very humorous. What makes this Payne's best film is that first, his characters are very real. Yea, I have met over-achievers like Tracy Flick (ELECTION) and women who don't have a clue like Ruth (CITIZEN RUTH), and my father reminds me of Warren Schmidt (ABOUT SCHMIDT), but the character of Miles is one of the few cinematic characters that I can relate to.First, who hasn't taken money from their mother? Such as the scene when Miles and Jack visit Miles' mother, then sneaks up to her bedroom and takes some of her saved money to finance their trip? Second, there is that love that you thought could work and tried so hard, yet it failed, and you sit there wondering what went wrong, such as Miles with his ex-wife Victoria. Third, why is it that opposites attract when it comes to friendship? Miles, the intellect, loves wine, literature, movies, and golf. While Jack, the handsome one, loves flirting with women, then having sex with them. These two men are so very different, yet they remain best friends, despite all of their ordeals. Then there are the little things that Payne does with this film. Such as the characters having ""bed heads""; driving not too fancy cars; being a little overweight; the protagonist purchasing an issue of ""Barely Legal"" (the new issue); the characters are not glamorous; having not too fancy jobs (Miles is a junior high English teacher; Jack is a voice over for commercials; Maya is a waitress; and Stephanie is a server). But it's those little realistic elements that make SIDEWAYS such a classic film! It's those touches that make Alexander Payne a unique and distinguished storyteller, and a great filmmaker.Finally there is the dialogue. Despite this film being full of conversation, the dialogue is great! Miles going ballistic and threatens to leave if Maya or Stephanie orders an Merlot. Jack asking Miles if he ""drink and dialed."" Stephanie with her subtle and calmness around Miles, but totally different around Jack. And Maya, the type of girl that many men dream of. The monologue that Madsen gives to Giamatti about the reason why she loves wine is a fantastic and very emotional monologue. I am so glad that SIDWAYS is getting the recognition that it deserves. This film DOES deserve to be nominated for Best Picture, Payne did a fantastic job directing, both Church and Madsen did excellent jobs with their performances, and Payne and Taylor adapted a wonderful story into a classic screenplay. But my heart goes out to Paul Giamatti, why did he get ignored? His performance of Miles was fantastic and great!!! But since it's pretty obvious that this years Best Actor is going to be singing ""What I'd Say"" after hearing his name announced (that's Jamie Foxx kids), Giamatti should have at least get recognition for his wonderful performance. Yet DiCapprio was excellent as Howard Hughes, Chadle was great in HOTEL RWANDA, Depp is and will always be good, Foxx did do a great job as Ray Charles, and I'm glad that Eastwood is getting recognized for his acting ability as well as his directing. SIDEWAYS is one of those films that a few more years from now, everyone will be quoting it, ""I'm not drinking Merlot!"" ""Did you go into the dark side?"" Some people won't admit it, but SIDEWAYS is the type of film that begins trends, when so many movies follow them. A lot of people my age praised other Fox Searchlight films from 2004, NAPOLEON DYNAMITE and GARDEN STATE are the two movies that most people my age talk about and praise. SIDEWAYS is my type of movie, and I feel that forty years from now, this film will still be discussed. It is a pure classic! ***** (out of five)",Sideways

This was rectified when I watched it again on my new giant projector screen in the basement the other night. I could watch this movie over and over again as there are so many wonderful aspects to it. The California backdrop is gorgeous, the lighting of the scenes is just perfect and the entire cast must have been assembled in heaven. I don't know how much my opinion can be relied upon as a critic but I've found that any movie that picks me up and walks me along with the cast through the story is one that can be thoroughly enjoyed. This one does just that.. Paul, Virginia, David and Sandra are just magic and they make you a part of the movie, that's why I'm using their first names! I know it's from 2004 but it's as good today as it was back then, a touching, thoughtful story that leaves you wanting more at the end.

180,ArizWldcat,Loved it! Interesting Character Study!,9,19 April 2005,"This was the thoroughly enjoyable story of two good friends, Miles and Jack, played by Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church. The two of them play good buddies who are off on one last week of ""freedom"" before Haden-Church's character is to be married. Miles regards himself as a failure; his marriage has failed, he teaches, but doesn't enjoy his job; he has attempted to write a novel and is waiting and waiting for his agent to call with the news of his novel's acceptance or rejection by a two-bit publisher. Jack is a not so successful actor, and is basically a jerk. He is unfaithful to his fiancée throughout the movie, and also treats his best friend poorly. He has learned how to manipulate people over the years, and it's fascinating to watch him work. The two men are closer to each other than they are to their women. Jack knows, for instance, when Miles gets drunk at dinner and leaves the table, exactly what he is up to. He also knows how to get Miles to do what he wants him to do. Miles, of course, is the better person. I was so happy that the movie ended the way it did. It might seem slow to some people, and is not a comedy in the fall-down-laughing category, yet I laughed aloud several times. I recommend this one! (Rated R, deservedly so)",Sideways
181,David_Frames,Life is like a bottle of wine you see...,9,22 February 2005,"Isn't that the message? Now we've got that out of the way lets talk about the wine for a little while. Some contentious conclusions here which we may want to look at a little closer. Good Pinot Noir is to be treasured certainly, but in the first winery Miles neglected to comment on the youth of said wine and the how this often works to its detriment. Pinot's a grape that must mature in order that its subtle nuances and complexities can properly manifest themselves. Sure you'll have a good 'ol time with the younger Pinots, washing down a thick venison steak or juicy turkey breast but are you rushing into a vinous-party only to find you're the first to arrive? Er, yes you are. Miles also talks about the flabby and overcooked nature of pure Cabernet Franc. Obviously neither he nor the 'easy drinking' Stephanie have had a one on one with the Walker's Pass 'Stuck in Lodi'- light, with a soft Nazi of raspberry fruit, peppered with a well integrated modicum of tannin and a fair, but not overpowering amount of acidity. Miles is simply wrong about Merlot, though he lives in a part of the New World that doesn't produce the best. California is insipifiying the world in that respect, so to with Cabernet which tends to be all fruit and no trousers. He mentions Riesling but doesn't expand on it, possibly because it doesn't lend itself too well to analogous comment designed to showcase your sensitive side and hasten sexual congress and the comment on Chardonnay is simplistic. Hasn't he ever had a good Meursaux? Just out of interest and in respect of Cheval Blanc, the old Saint-Emillion White Horse 1961, apparently the best vintage of which there's any left is the 1947 owing to some particularly favourable ground frost that year. No, i didn't know that either. The film is pretty fine too - truthful, well played and in turns both funny and bleak. The leads are excellent and the script never feels contrived or (because I had to use one wine metaphor) overcooked. Payne's best work to date.",Sideways

The two bumbling buddies stumble upon one screwball adventure after another from Jack's sexual escapades to Miles' depression and anti-social behavior leading to excessive drinking. This is one of those movies that puts its characters at turning points in their lives and asks them to move on to something new. A clichéd concept, however, Payne's story-line and dialogue are so fresh that the film becomes a moving portrait, in particular of Miles' life and his downward spiral after his divorce and failures as a writer.

Then there is Miles (Paul Giamatti) who is the shy, quiet friend who sees disappointment in every phase of his life, a person who cannot escape the past and you never thought would ever get married. Sideways pairs these two (friends since college) for Jack's final week of being a bachelor to California wine country, where Miles spends his summers and Jack goes along to find one more girl before he marries. It does not take long for Jack to find one, a wine pourer at one of the many wineries they stop at, Stephanie (Sandra Oh from Arli$$ fame, if that is indeed fame). As luck would have it, Stephanie is friends with Maya (Virginia Madsen), a waitress at a restaurant Miles stops in often, and whom Miles has always pined for. The setup is there for a movie where we see Miles finally happy, we get the sense through Giamatti's performance that Miles may have been happy once in his life, not even during his marriage, but instead, we see a movie where Miles falls further into the depths of depression, amplified more by comparisons he makes with his friend, Jack. The results are often explosive and sad, Miles cannot find anything to be happy about, and he uses the wine to try to comfort himself, which just causes more problems. While a remarkable character study, Sideways is always a very funny comedy. There are laugh-out-loud funny scenes, followed by Christopher Guest-like subtle scenes of quiet comedy. The funniest scene involves someone stealing a wallet, and a fat naked guy running through the streets, just to show that there is enough broad comedy for all to enjoy. The ending made me the happiest, there is a bit of an open ended ending, every viewer decides what will happen. Let's just hope Miles can make the right decision too.",Sideways
184,patryk-czekaj,Great comedy from the master of existential angst,8,18 December 2012,"In Sideways - Alexander Payne's most bittersweet comedy to date - men on the verge of emotional breakdowns need to take a dangerous journey into the deepest parts of their minds, in order to challenge all the incoming problems, and - ultimately - accept their better feelings. To find solace and tranquility in life is an uneasy task, and the characters of the picture learn that harsh lesson very quickly, just as they traverse through the sunny, chic wine country of California.Miles (Paul Giamatti) and Jack (Thomas Haden Church) are two middle-aged buddies, who decided to spend a few days just roaming around various vineyards tasting wine and eating good food, just before the latter will take the trip down the aisle. Miles is both an unsuccessful, nerve- racking writer and a passionate wine lover. Even though he tries to enjoy his time, he still can't forget about the fact that his wife has left him a couple of months ago. Jack is a struggling actor, a former TV star, and a desperate playboy, who will jump at every opportunity just to get laid. His laid-back attitude and quirky humor make a local girl named Stephanie (sandy Oh) fall in love with him. While Jack is having a good time doing wild things with his new partner, Miles is striving to impress a pretty woman Maya (Virginia Madsen), who also happens to be a big wine amateur. Though Miles has nothing to show for himself as a person, he's able to make a girl interested just by saying all those ridiculously poetic stories about everything wine-y. He's miserable and anxious all the time, yet Maya seems to be the cure for all his troubles. In the meantime, the sex-filled relationship between Jack and Stephanie is brutally stopped because of the little marriage-related secret that's finally been revealed. Ironically, even the humiliation and beating don't stop Jack from trying another one of his cunning tricks on another unsuspecting lady. And who's going to help him when all his plans are in shambles? Of course no one other than the good ol' Miles.In all the naturalism and humanism that permeate the film, Sideways proves to be a smart, wonderfully-written dark comedy that is not only humorous, but also tremendously realistic. The story might go both ways, and it does at some point, just to arrive at a conclusion that is as heartbreaking as it is actually pleasing. The boys come back from the trip changed, they think differently, and the aspirations that they now have are incomparable. Sideways - with all its charm and subtle pretentiousness - shows that Alexander Payne knows how to create a madly good film with a splendid character-driven narrative, where existential angst is only a man's world.",Sideways
185,headly66,Brilliant comedy that gets better each time I see it.,10,1 March 2010,"The first time I saw this film I was alone and even without someone to share the experience with I was in stitches the entire time. The movie unfolds beautifully, the subtle little nuances in this straightforward story line, it simply couldn't be better. The sadness of Miles character, his life and his fear of success is a pleasant switch from all the hero movies out there, he is the anti-hero, an absolute loser in all aspects of his life yet he seems to enjoy every minute of it. As if his success would be selling out and lowering him from the rarefied air he has envisioned for himself, he is smart, funny and well liked but wants nothing to do with that, he wallows in self pity and blames the world for his mistakes. Jack's character is truly sad and the antithesis of Miles, he has everything he wants in life yet has urges that can not be fulfilled. He is marrying a beautiful educated woman but needs cheap sex to preserve the adolescence he yearns to maintain.I'm amazed that anyone would give this a bad review, some of the comments are ridiculous, even picking on the characters like they are supposed to be better people than they are. They seem jealous of the movie? Why because it is smart and adult and it doesn't have any special effects or explosions? This is a wonderful film full of reality and humor. It shows people in a real light and doesn't pretend to be anything it is not. Every scene is useful to the plot, from the mundane daily minutia to the drop dead funny of catching Jack in the act.Highly recommended.",Sideways
186,dougandwin,What a week!,8,18 February 2005,"The two stars of ""Sideways"" decide to have a week together away, before one of them gets married, and what a week it turns out to be. Full of some extremely funny moments, yet mixed with great pathos. It certainly shows the best and worst in our characters, with Haden Church being a stand-out as the groom-to-be. The discussions on wine may seem never-ending, but are significant to the characters. The dialogue is quite brilliant, while the scenery in and near the vineyards of California is breath-taking, and worth the admission alone. It is a film with a great deal of depth, and I rate it highly among the films shown this season.",Sideways
187,chiumt,A Talkie Masterpiece,8,22 September 2019,This is the second time I'm watching this. And it is just as refreshing as the first. There is very little action. Just talk.

188,Benjamin_Cox,Subtle tones of tragedy and comedy make this a refreshing change from the norm - 84%,8,6 March 2005,"Sometimes, when I go to the movies as I nearly always do on a Sunday, I keep thinking about how much the ticket cost and whether the film was worth it or not. I still cry real tears at the painful memory of how much I paid to see ""Stigmata"" (£26 for two adults - hey, I was in love!) and smirk with mischief at seeing ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"" for just £3. Some films have a definite feel of how much you'd pay to see them. For example, ""The Incredibles"" is a film so good that I'd happily pay £10 to see again. Whereas something with Steven Seagal in it should come with a refund. ""Sideways"" comes in at around £8.50 which is what I paid. It is a genuinely funny film but not one that batters you into submission. It works it's magic gently and before you know it, you're hooked.The film takes place in California, a week before the wedding of faded actor Jack (Thomas Haden Church). He is off on a week-long wine-tasting trip organized by his best friend Miles (Paul Giamatti), a struggling writer and wine connoisseur extraordinaire. Miles' aim is to show Jack a good time, to spend some quality time with his friend drinking some damn fine Pinot Noir and playing a few rounds of golf. Jack's aim is to make the most of his numbered days of singledom by getting himself and Miles laid. As both men's agendas become clearer, their friendship is tested even further by the arrival of sexy waitress Maya (Virginia Madsen) and wine expert Stephanie (Sandra Oh).I must confess, I wasn't expecting this to be as funny as it was. It isn't a laugh-a-minute comedy that goes for the jugular each time. Once acquainted with the characters, it feels very much like an episode of ""Frasier"" in that the characters spark off each other very well before the whole thing descends into a classic farce. As Miles' once-noble plan comes crashing down around him, you feel utter sympathy for him as he bears the brunt of his friend's consequences. Personally, I lay the blame squarely on the shoulders of the excellent Giamatti who makes Miles not only believable but also heart-wrenchingly tragic. Misfortune after misfortune continues to rain down upon him until the inevitable happens, much to our own amusement. Church is the perfect foil, portraying a complete bastard brought down by his own lust yet unaware of Miles' reaction. Together, they hit every mark on the button - whether it's a quick one-liner or a facial response, these two make us laugh almost at will.To be fair, the film does slow a bit in the middle before rallying once again towards the climax. I also found myself wondering how two seemingly different people could ever have been friends for as long as they appear to have been. But despite these (admittedly minor) niggles, this is as good a comedy as you'll see this year. It's good to see that some people are trying to make comedies that aren't reliant on jokes about tits, sex and Keenan Ivory Waynes. It won't be to everybody's tastes but personally speaking, this is one that really hits the spot. Like a good Pinot...",Sideways

While it's certainly not a ""cinematic masterpiece"", it's pretty damn good. And I'm not even a wine drinker! Giamatti & Church make a great pair of early middle-age slackers, trying to score a last blast of ""gonzo bachelorhood"" before Church's character ties the knot. And Sandra Oh & Viginia Madsen are quite fine as the gals they seek. Add in a great script and fine direction from Payne (who has pretty much delivered every time out), and SIDEWAYS gives us a fast-moving, entertaining 2 hours.Best scenes for me---Giamatti's Miles going ballistic on the golf course when the trailing group hits into them (who hasn't wanted to do that?), Miles chugging the wine spit bucket after hearing the bad news from his agent, and of course Miles retrieving the wallet from ""white-trash trailer land"".This movie will certainly stand the test of time.",Sideways
190,saarvardi,"Now here's a film about the best things in life: wine, women and open roads yet-to-be-traveled",10,19 July 2007,"Now here's a film about the best things in life: wine, women and open roads yet-to-be-traveled. If you're not a fan of an occasional good glass of wine (preferably Pinot), you will become so after watching this wonderful independent hit that was nominated for 5 Academy Awards during the 2004 Oscar season (including Best Picture), and grossed nearly 80 million dollars in box office receipts in the US alone  a respectable sum for such an adult orientated picture.Sideways is a surprisingly touching story of friendship, betrayal and coming to terms with one's fate amidst a midlife crisis. Paul Giamatti (American Splendor) and Thomas Hayden Church (from TV's hit show Ned & Stacy) play Miles and Jack, two friends who are the exact opposite of one another. Miles is a divorced failed writer who hasn't accomplished much in life and has an obsession with wine. Jack is a light headed actor, who's done mostly minor gigs in commercials and such, who's about to get married. When Miles offers him to embark on a road trip to California's tasty wine vintages, Jack sees this as an opportunity to score as much as he can before tying the knot. While Miles' intentions are aimed at getting as drunk as he can and escape his miserable existence, Jack tries to divert their trip for his own agenda. Shortly after, the two hit the jackpot, as they encounter Maya and Stephanie, a pair of wine and fun loving women (Virginia Madsen, who gives out a stunning performance after being literally anonymous up to this film; and Sandra Oh from Grey's Anatomy fame). Soon enough, the insecure Miles makes his first hesitated steps towards Maya, whereas Jack has mainly one thing on his mind. Hilarious, emotional and inspirational moments ensue  the first and foremost being the touchy monologue scene when Miles and Maya reminisce about the way their respective love for wine developed. In my opinion, for that scene alone Virginia Madsen should have picked the supporting actress Oscar; but instead the Academy preferred the lesser performance of Cate Blanchett in The Aviator. Anyway, it's one of those ""you have to see it to understand it"" issues, but there's so much subtle sexual tension in that particular scene, so many words that are unspoken rather than spoken, that makes it, and the movie as a whole, nearly close to perfection.Besides, where else will you learn how to taste wine properly, have a good laugh and relate to two of the most charming losers ever seen on film  all at once? Do yourself a favor; don't miss out on this one!",Sideways
191,pere-25366,An exquisite journey of self-reflection and contemplation,9,22 August 2016,"Every once in a while, there comes a film that makes you question a lot about your own existence. In ""Sideways"", we are given a firsthand look into the lives of two men reaching middle age, both of whom are searching for something, yet neither of them are entirely certain what that something is. Miles (Giamatti) is a struggling writer, and wine enthusiast, who takes his engaged friend Jack (Church) on what he thinks will be a nice, tranquil trip through the California vineyards.""Sideways"" is very bold mainly because it focuses on in-depth conversation between its characters. The sharp, introspective dialogue present throughout the film is beautifully written and does an excellent job of allowing us to not only comprehend, but identify with, its characters. By the end I felt as if I truly knew these friends inside and out, showing the compelling results of such a true-to-life story whose soul focus is to help its audience better understand its two vastly different male focal points.This film bristles with a certain 'je ne sais quoi' that is both charming and absorbing. Its inherent and forgivably episodic narrative takes you into the minds of its characters – we are not merely watching Jack and Miles take a trip through California's wine country, but rather accompanying them for the ride. And the journey on the road is subtly symbolic of presenting us with two men at a crossroads – whose lives until now are largely devoid of any real meaning. Jack is looking to sew some wild oats and Miles is, well, busy keeping his feelings bottled up as he continues to ironically open bottle after bottle of Pinot.Paul Giamatti transcended himself to new heights with his performance of a stoic, withdrawn individual. He is able to inject his customary, animated self into the role, though it is far more subdued here. His sad, musing gaze helps to achieve a certain pathos and breeds further tension and vulnerability that shows the despair of a man that has struggled for years. Everything from the inflexion of his words to his character's nuances are so spot on, especially in the ""Why are you so into Pinot?"" scene, which was one of the film's most engrossing moments.The supporting performances were also fantastic, including Virginia Madsen as the sweet, warm-hearted Maya, and Sandra Oh as the out-going, kinky Stephanie. But the real star was undoubtedly Giamatti, breathing life into a character with such profound depth that the fact he wasn't even nominated for Best Actor is a crime in itself. ""Sideways"" takes you on both a literal and figurative journey that provides an exquisite take on coming to grips with life's impromptu changes.",Sideways
192,merrywood,A String of Pearls,10,19 December 2004,"This film has Oscar buzz all around it. It's a beautifully crafted, brightly written string of pearls. Its lead players, Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church, are both actors we remember seeing from time to time for at least the past fifteen years but whose names never before appeared on our radar screens. Here they both enter the arena of notable film actors and memorably so. The film is a comedy drama to a great extent (at least in my own mind) influenced in style by my late friend, John Cassavetes. Finely directed by Alexander Payne, its comedy issues from the breast of characterization and not contrived, pasted on sit-com lines. This alone is rare in film and denotes craft writing of the preeminent kind.The icing on this cake is its constancy and within that its splendid subtlety. The story is simple; two friends get together for a last weekend of wine tasting in some of Southern California's wineries just before the marriage of one of them. As it unfolds we see that the story clearly issues from the breast of the two characters, a hapless English teacher still suffering over his divorce of two years past. He has written an honest novel instead of a commercial one so we know that it will not be published some time before the reveal. The other, his pal since college some twenty years before is a fringe actor about to be married but struggling to retain his youth through womanizing. This Lothario is no less pathetic than his writer friend. The film is beautifully cast with the extraordinary Virginia Madsen as the writer's acquaintance with potential to be more. Highly recommended; be prepared to laugh for just over two hours with very little let up while at the same time being conveyed to the essence of our humanity.",Sideways

One guy wants to taste wine, the other wants to get laid. Simple, huh? Needless to say, it isn't.It seems to release films like this, you have to unlearn most of modern cinema.

And this film came highly recommended to me. Although not bad by any means I had a problem truly seeing what all the buzz was about. Although I found the film somewhat interesting, and the performances arresting, the strained plot and familiar dialogue didn't have a huge impact on me. Sideways is a pretty good film but it's familiar territory maybe visited in an unusual way but still familiar, there's very little thats slightly original here. Now that I've gotten those words off of my chest let's critque it. Sideways is the story of two men celebrating one of there weddings with a week long trip into wine tasting company played effectively but not memorably by the two films leads. The supporting performances are rounded out by two impressive and memorable turns by Virginia Madsen and Sandra Oh. The movie is about basically just that, despite a little wine knowledge and character growth that I will spare mentioning for the sake of not revealing spoilers. It has it's funny moments, and some impressively dramatic ones. what the film lacks is any type of real punch. I get what it's all about but by the end of the film I really don't care. It's not told in an impressively memorable way or hits any emotional or laugh inducing hot spots. Sideways just is not a bad movie by any means but no where in the range of being a good one. 6/10",Sideways

Alexander Payne has directed this wonderfully funny cinema in a light and airy way that is comical to the hilt. Paul Giamatti plays Miles Raymond, a would-be novelist who is divorced about one and a half years and teaching middle school English. His compadre, Jack, played beautifully by Thomas Haden Church is cast to perfection. Together they spend a week driving down highway 101 on the California coast. They sample wines as they go and encounter two lovely ladies during their brief adventure. Sandra Oh plays Maya, Jack's soon to be girlfriend. However, when she finds out that Jack is engaged to be married on Saturday, she gives him the licking of his life. Miles is more sedate and cerebral. His waitress friend, Maya, played by Virginia Madsen, develops a relationship with him that lasts till the end of the film. The ending, however, leaves one guessing, and perhaps that is a perfect way to top off this very entertaining movie. I five it four thumbs up if I only had that many.",Sideways

Exquisitly portrayed, as Wine is, the travel through joyful pastures and lonesome roads brings the friends into conflicts and misunderstandings. Their chats are simply beautiful, honest and crystal clear; not complicated and human. The movie stands strong on its colossus script, delivering a story that is quiet, that may seem boring but really is quite fun and a great portray of how one can recover and leave the past behind.A great achievement on independent filming.",Sideways
199,diand_,Relive the 70s,6,26 January 2005,"Payne's movies are always strongly character-driven, almost to the point that other elements seem to suffer. Having final cut a number of scenes however take too much time and this movie almost falls flat in the middle as there is no further evolving of the story. Editing as a whole is very unsurprising. Also music seems to fit in as an added bonus and misses a strong relation with the rest of the movie. (Take Kubrick or Malick as examples of how music can be pivotal to the crafting of a movie).The strong point here is the acting and direction of the acting. The best scenes are those without any lines as it is then that we can see right through the characters and their bare essentials come to (screen) life. Payne seems to love the great character dramas of the 70s.It is a difficult task to portray relatively uninteresting movie characters like retired people (About Schmidt) or failed teachers and writers. And it sometimes succeeds well, especially on the humor part. But the whole exercise fails to leave any final impact and feels somewhat shallow.P.S. I saw this movie with the director present and the Q&A was interesting for a short debate about the ending. Some of the public found the ending a little too happy, but Payne argued that it is already toned down in comparison with the book. He also said that Miles has gone through a learning process and has grown out of the experience.",Sideways

The reason I like Sideways, for better or for worse, is I know both Jack and Miles too well. At one time or another, I've walked in both of their shoes. Alexander Payne reaches a zenith of sorts with his quiet eccentric style. The film blends friendship, the road trip and a party flick. The wine provides an interesting tenor to boot. Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church are completely irreplaceable in their respective roles. They're sort of cosmopolitan R2D2 and C3P0 roadies.",Sideways
203,movibuf1962,Knowing wine is not a prerequisite.,9,10 February 2005,"A friend recommended SDWYS to me, stating only that a certain scene coming about halfway through the film (featuring a monologue by Paul Giamatti) reminded him of me, word for word. So be it. And I was not only blown away at the honesty and the sophistication of of script, but tremendously flattered at the reference. Mainly because I do not think of the lead character as a loser. Yes, he's soft-spoken. Yes, he's an introvert around the fairer sex, and yes he (and the actor) do not resemble Brad Pitt. But I'm wickedly sick of romantic comedies where the hero is a pretty boy like Pitt or Ben Affleck or Freddie Prinze, and he can't get a date. This formula has been done to death in romantic comedies and, frankly, now insults my intelligence. SDWYS does something that few mainstream films do nowadays: it presents a story aimed at a demographic older than the age of 22. People who are mature but not ""old."" People who talk with passion, conviction, and intelligence- whether it's on the subject of wine (which I know nothing about), book publishing, or even getting laid. I can relate to Miles's insecurities and eccentricities. But this particular film requires patience. It moves a bit slowly, giving extra time and care to the dialog and emotions, and (as you have already seen in some of the comments) some viewers are put off by that- choosing rather arrogantly to only see 'a couple of middle-aged losers who drink a lot of wine.' Oh, well...Granted, life would be easier if everyone were young and pretty, and the boy could get the girl without breaking a sweat, but if things happened that quickly, we'd be deprived of Virginia Madsen- radiant in a late-night front porch scene opposite Giamatti; as she talks about the life of the wine and the history of the grape, it seems to be the moment that Giamatti (and indeed the rest of us) fall in love with her. But even movies can afford to show a bit of real life now and then. It gives me hope for more realism in future films. I raise a Pinot Noir to director Alexander Payne, and especially to star Paul Giamatti. Cheers.",Sideways
204,cashbacher,"Not a comedy, but a great ambiguous ending",8,30 November 2019,"The label on the case states ""Best comedy of the year,"" but from my perspective it was hard to see the justification for that comment. Paul Giamatti plays Miles and Thomas Haden Church plays Jack, and both are in some form of mid-life crisis. Miles is still struggling to come to terms with his divorce and Jack is due to be married on the upcoming weekend. As a form of coping with the changes, they embark on a wine-tasting trip through the California wine country.
Miles is a teacher of English and a true wine aficionado, while Jack is clueless about the subject. Miles is also a struggling novelist; he has submitted a manuscript to a publisher and is awaiting a publication decision. Jack is basically on the hunt for women for both of them.
These are two guys that have serious problems in many aspects of their lives, yet there is one constant, their loyalty to each other. This is one of the most intense bromances I have ever seen, no matter what Jack does, Miles will aid him, even to the point of letting Jack wreck his car in order to construct an alibi.
This is a movie about the complexity of adult relationships, when they have ended, when they are beginning and when they are constant. On that level, it is successful, these are two guys with serious issues in their lives, sometimes you empathize and other times you are uttering the phrase, ""You pathetic buffoon!"" There is nothing amusing about coming to the realization that you are not going to achieve your lifelong dream.
I loved the ambiguous ending that is reminiscent of the classic Frank R. Stockton story, ""The Lady or the Tiger?"" It is presented as an ending rather than as a cliffhanger to leave viewers begging for a sequel.",Sideways
205,NateManD,"Works Great as a Yuppie mid life crisis Snob Fest movie, but not a Comedy.",5,14 June 2005,"For the last eight months or more, I'd been hearing so much about the film ""Sideways"". I was excited, because Alexander Payne is a talented director who makes witty satirical comedies. ""Citizen Ruth"" and ""Election"" are two of the funniest dark comedies I have ever seen. The critics were practically going into orgasm about how Sideways was such a great film. After all the hype I was slightly disappointed. The film had great acting and gorgeous cinematography, but an average story with not as much humor as I'd expect from an Alexander Payne film. Critics were all raving about the film, saying it was the year's funniest and best film etc etc etc. I wonder if these same critics found the eight minute anal rape scene in Casper Noe's ""Irreversible"" hilarious as well. All exaggeration aside, the concept of a wine testing road trip was interesting, but the two main characters Miles and Jack, weren't very likable. They are basically self loathing yuppie snobs. Both Paul Giamatti and Thomas Hayden Church are great actors, but how can I the viewer feel sympathetic to these characters. Miles (Giamatti) is a dull, stuck up, wine testing English teacher and author who steals money from his own mom in one scene, and Jack (Church) is a horny B-list actor who screws around when he's supposed to be getting married. Jack hits it off with Stepanie, played by director's former wife Sandra Oh. And she lives up to her name Sanda Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, since her and Jack are always screwing. Both Miles and Jack, keep his wedding a secret. Oops! (spoiler alert) Not A good idea ! Miles hits it off with Maya (Madsen) who also has a love for the fine wines, her character is by far the most likable. She puts up with Miles snobbish attitude and even tries to read his autobiographical book he wrote. I loved Giamatti's character in ""Storytelling"" even though I don't care for him as Miles. The only moment in Sideways that had me laughing, was the scene where they had to go back to the house of the waitress who Jack also screwed to get his wallet and not interrupt her redneck husband while he's porking her. It's not that I didn't enjoy the film, it's just I was expecting it to be like Paynes other films, which are hilarious. It's worth a view. But if you want to laugh, rent ""Citizen Ruth"" or ""Election"" which are flawless. On further note, I mostly blame 20th century Fox for misleading people. Not only in the news, but marketing films. This is a company that labeled ""Donnie Darko"" a horror film, ""Fight Club"" an action film and ""Ravenous"" a comedy. Clearly the dimwitted executives of Fox could care less about cinema. At least they didn't label ""the Passion"" a romantic comedy or ""Sideways"" a Sci-Fi thriller.",Sideways
206,guyfromjerzee,"A slightly uneven, but very enjoyable film",8,14 December 2004,"After seeing ""About Schmidt,"" I was deeply impressed with Alexander Payne and said to myself, ""I can't wait to see his next film."" Well, his next film came along and I was very satisfied with the results. I didn't enjoy the movie as much as ""Schmidt,"" but it still displays Payne's knack for creating characters that are fascinating and quirky, yet realistic. These are definitely not caricatures. We've seen a good deal of movies about guys having pre-wedding jitters, and living it up before marching down the aisle.But this movie puts an interesting spin on that premise: The guy about to get married is the free spirit, while the single guy needs to loosen up. Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church are both magnificent. Their chemistry is pitch-perfect. I've loved Giamatti ever since I saw him as Pig Vomit in ""Private Parts."" In ""Sideways"" he gets the chance to play the lead. I haven't seen ""American Splendor,"" so this was my first chance to see him in a lead role. Some actors are greatly talented, but don't have the chops to play the lead. Giamatti is not one of those actors. You can argue that he's been typecast as these paranoid George Costanza types. But typecasting is no excuse. He's always able to play a variation on that type of role, in every character he inhabits. He's an extremely gifted actor with a great face that's full of expression - especially in his eyes. But since he doesn't have ""leading man looks,"" Hollywood will probably keep on snubbing him and choose people like George Clooney or Tom Cruise to play lead roles. I don't have anything against those two actors, but let's face it - Giamatti is a better representative of the average man, in looks and behavior. Thomas Haden Church is mainly known for his sitcom work in shows like ""Wings"" and ""Ned and Stacey,"" but hopefully he'll have more decent movie roles lined up after this film, because he really is an underrated talent. Plus, his comic timing is impeccable. The thing I've always liked about Payne's movies is he tends to choose actors who look like regular people. That includes the supporting cast and extras. There is a scene in which an overweight couple has sex, but the fact that they're having sex is not what's played for laughs. One person on the site criticized the movie for being about two losers. First of all, I think ""loser"" is a subjective term that has been twisted around to death. Second of all, if they're losers because they encounter problems that everyday people face, then it's a pretty stupid reason to dismiss the film. What do you want to see? A movie about two billionaires? I want to see movies about everyday people! That's the beauty of independent film. You get the chance to see and relate to characters, who are not too much unlike yourself. Like ""About Schmidt,"" the movie is filled with hilarious moments (the greatest being the one involving a naked, middle-aged man running down a street), it maintains a great human element. And the story is never predictable. You can never expect a Hollywood ending from a Payne film. It actually leaves things pretty open-ended - the way a lot of films should end. Now onto what I didn't like...the movie drags in certain parts. I felt the wine jargon was a little overdone. Let's not forget that there are people in the audience (me being one of them), who aren't very knowledgeable about wine. So I could've done without the long passages of dialogue about the most trivial aspects of wine. But that aside, this is definitely a film I would recommend. If you're in the mood for a nice, character-driven dramedy - this will suit your needs. (8 out of 10)",Sideways
207,FilmSnobby,Drink now -- don't hold.,7,16 November 2004,"One is strongly tempted to overrate *Sideways*. When one sees a GOOD movie, like *Sideways*, after one has seen far too many bad movies in a calendar year, that person will inevitably fall in love with it, proselytize its merits to his friends, and start demanding Oscar noms for it.It's NOT a masterpiece: it meanders, it dawdles, the photography is unforgivably washed out (but then director Alexander Payne has never seemed to care much about cinematography -- see *Election* and *About Schmidt* for further evidence), it sometimes goes for the all-too-easy laugh (""I'M LEAVING IF WE'RE DRINKING MERLOT!"" etc.), it's really rather too long, and the premise, such as it is, dances around too many Mid-Life Crisis clichés.OK -- so much for the bad news. But, like a prematurely-opened bottle of noble Bordeaux, *Sideways* reveals to the discerning connoisseur its brilliance, its potential, and its immediate pleasures underneath the coarse tannins and acidic immaturity. The movie concerns itself with a pair of longtime pals and former college roommates (Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church) who embark on a wine-tasting-and-golfing expedition through California's Central Coast region. One of the men, Church's character Jack, is getting married in a week, and so this road-trip is meant to be a sort of Final Bit of Fun that the two can share on their own. Giamatti's Miles is expecting to instruct Jack in the finer points of wine-tasting, while receiving instruction from Jack on how to golf. But Jack has other ideas: namely, to chase as many skirts as they can before the dreaded Saturday nuptials.Giamatti and Church prove to be one of the most unlikely, and most successful, comedy duos to hit the silver screen in many a year. Payne gets a lot of mileage from these contrasting personalities, never more so than when they visit the various wineries in the area: Miles pompously recounts the various odors of a pinot (""strawberry, passion fruit, asparagus, just a hint of cheese""), while Jack downs his pour like a tequila shot (""Yeah, that's good""). There's equal fun to be had at the expense of these two aging boy-men: the pretentious know-it-all and the unknowing hedonist.Jack is on something of a mission to hook up mopey Miles -- who is licking wounds from a fresh divorce -- with any chick that comes to hand. Inevitably, they cross paths with two gorgeous creatures: Virginia Madsen (in the comeback role of the year) and the always-engaging and sexy Sandra Oh. Madsen is a top-flight waitress at Miles' favorite fancy restaurant in the area, while Oh is a pourer at one of the wineries they visit. Jack immediately latches onto Oh's Stephanie, while Miles and Madsen's Maya engage in a more wary courtship. At one point, Miles and Maya deliver monologues to each other about why they're passionate about wine (""pinot is the thinnest-skinned grape"", ""a wine's character depends on the moment you open the bottle; wine is a LIVING thing""). The movie's theme is obviously illustrated for us in this scene; we can be thankful that the scene manages to be beautifully and naturally written.Even better, the movie is not merely a meditation on the themes of middle age, but is also frankly hilarious and bawdy, with sequences that produced great laughter from the audience I saw it with. Indeed, I haven't seen an audience laugh this loudly at a film in quite a while (I certainly haven't laughed this loudly at a film in quite a while). I'm betting that *Sideways* emerges as a sleeper hit this Oscar season. Or, let me put it this way: the only better film I've seen than *Sideways* in the past 6 months was Mike Leigh's *Vera Drake* (released a few weeks ago), which makes *Sideways* one of the best movies of 2004, in my humble opinion. The movie also cements Alexander Payne's reputation as one of the best practitioners of the craft in this country. Give him his due, and see this movie. 7 stars out of 10.",Sideways
208,RobertF87,Brilliant Comedy-Drama,9,29 January 2005,"With all the critical praise that has been lavished on this film you might think it was one of the best things ever made. It isn't, not by along shot, but it is a charming, funny and genuinely moving blend of comedy and drama.It tells the story of two middle-aged friends: Miles (Paul Giamatti) is a divorced, depressed, wannabe-novelist who still hasn't gotten over his ex-wife (despite being divorced for two years) and his main interest is wine-tasting. His friend Jack (Thomas Haden Church) is an unsuccessful actor, whose main work is doing voice-overs in adverts. Jack is about to be married, and so Miles takes him on a week-long road trip to celebrate. It turns out that while Miles just wants to spend the week tasting wine and playing golf, Jack wants to spend the week trying to seduce women.This film is surprisingly dark, in that it deals in large part with rejection, disappointment and failure. The film is very well made. Both Church and Giamatti are excellent (playing two often quite unpleasant characters) and so are Virgina Madsen and Sandra Oh as the women that the men meet on their journey.While the film is a little too long in places it manages to hold an audience with it's charm and provides enough laughs and food for thought to keep the viewer entertained.",Sideways
209,pekinman,Men on the verge of a nervous breakdown,6,15 July 2005,"There are many excellent things in Alexander Payne's film 'Sideways' The cast is wonderful, especially the infrequently seen and beautiful Virginia Madsen. It is good that she has such a fine script to work with here, she deserves to be cast in more and better films as she appears to be in her prime. Sandra Oh is another actress that should be seen more on film. The scenes involving these two actresses are the highlights of this Abbott and Costello meets vicodin and xanax romp. I liked Paul Giametti and Thomas Haden Church. They are a good team, Giametti making a great straight man for Church's airhead down and out actor. The wine stuff manages to not be boring and the inside jokes about vintages and grapes were not so over-done as to leave the average 'Hardly Burgundy' drinker in the dark. What baffled me about 'Sideways' is that I didn't find it very funny at all. Yes, there are many subtle, fleeting moments that capture the American lifestyle in a biting, satiric manner There is a moment in Miles' mother's house showing the TV tuned to the History Channel with their ubiquitous documentaries on Hitler. I have come to call that channel the Hitler Channel as that is about all they program. And everywhere you looked there are bottles of prescription drugs. And the moment anyone starts feeling a bit ""down"" they just pop a blue pill. Little insights like that kept my attention on this otherwise depressing take on our contemporary cultural neuroses.The technical aspects are all fine. The cinematography of the central coast's wine country is very beautiful. The more squalid aspects of California living are also in evidence; the slovenly house where the chubby waitress and her trucker husband live, the tourist trap winery with the giant hoses pouring generic red into a tanker, the depressing motel, the bowling alley, the wrecked and confused lives of an army of divorced people, Miles' strange, dead-end apartment, the mounds of food served in the restaurants etc. Alexander Payne certainly has a lot more to say about all these aspects of our society and I must look into his other films. I sensed a great, satiric genius lurking behind the camera that didn't quite fully reveal himself in 'Sideways'. I wouldn't recommend this film to those on the brink of suicide, nor for anyone in the depths of mid-life crisis or career set-backs.It's a thought-provoking film but hardly a non-stop guffaw.",Sideways

And Jack meets Stephanie (Oh) a Asian wine tester. Jack forgetting about his wife starts to fall in love with her, and Miles not really thinking about sex instead prefers the finer things tasting wine and getting a little wasted.Till Miles accidentally tells Maya about the wedding everything is going smooth with Jack and Stephanie. Sideways is another one of Giamatti's score performance his best since the adaptation of Harvey Pekar comics American Splendor. And still I am amazed such a good actor would star in Big Momma's House with Martin Lawrence.

The cinematography is wonderful and captures the beauty of the Central coast of California very well.

212,howie73,Bittersweet comedy drama,8,9 April 2005,"I'm surprised by many reviewers here who have denounced this well-crafted, indie hit. Generally speaking the objection is that the two main characters, Miles and Jack, are unlikeable and therefore unsympathetic. Since when do we want to see one-dimensional clones masquerading as film characters? Director Alexander Payne has rejected the saccharine conventions of Hollywood and managed to capture human frailty and the general sadness of rejection and isolation. Paul Giamatti's Miles may be a boorish wine snob with a penchant for Pinot Noir, but the film is never afraid to show him in his good and bad moments - not the boring, annoying failure many have castigated him here for, but a man stunted by emotional inadequacy and embittered by his ex-wife's new-found happiness. Paul Giamatti gives a stunning performance and conveys Miles's flaws and redeeming traits with a conviction that is quite rare in Hollywood cinema. It's a pity Jamie Foxx had to win the Oscar this year and more shocking that Giamatti wasn't even nominated. I don't care what the critics have said here, I felt sympathy towards Miles, especially towards the end, where his self-pity transformed into what might have been hope.This is undoubtedly Giamatti's film but the supporting cast are very good, especially Virgina Madsen as Maya. Sandra Oh's character was underdeveloped but perhaps that's what Payne intended. Thomas Haden Church gives a consistent performance as Jack.Is this a comedy? Not in the sterile Hollywood sense! This is more European in tone than American and this is perhaps why many have felt disappointed by the film. Payne detaches himself from the action; he's not only chronicles of the frailties of human beings from a neutral standpoint but has enough subtlety to bring out the poignancy of Miles's plight and make us care. There are, however, funny moments - especially on the golf course and in the vineyard bar. The dialog is also sharp and insightful, with many rude lines here - well, the nun simile anyway! Ultimately, a bittersweet and sardonic film with heart. The end, I must say, was spot-on. Well done to all concerned. I was praying that Payne would not sentimentalize the end but he kept his touch right until the credits rolled. Another poke in the eye for Hollywood gloss.",Sideways

If you give this film time, however, and allow yourself to be completely invested in the characters and the relationships they have with each other, then this film will give you a positive experience.Paul Giamatti is one of the most underrated actors out there and gives a wonderful performance here; in this film, the acting is great across the board. Some of the camera work and visual style used in this film when designing scenes are spectacular, which is more than enough to hold the interest of a film buff.I really liked the direction this movie went in and was ultimately happy with its conclusion.

214,blackburnj-1,A truly Great Film,9,25 October 2005,"Wine, women and comedy always go well together. Sideways follows the escapades of Miles (Paul Giamatti) and Jack (Thomas Haden Church), two men in mid-life crises, who go on a week of wine-tasting in the run up to Jack's wedding. However, Jack turns it into an attempt to bed as many women as possible and to get Miles together with the beautiful and intelligent Maya (Virginia Madsen).Alexander Payne has created a masterpiece. Beautifully written by Payne and Jim Taylor, the films is hilarious with fantastic set pieces, one liners and interesting and attractive characters, set in the glorious surroundings of the Californian vineyards. This wonderful setting is accompanied by Rolfe Kent's zippy Jazz score. It is also shot well and edited in a variety of ways that creates a fantastic feel for the film.Paul Giamatti is fantastic, giving a beautiful performance as Miles, the middle-aged man coming to terms with his two year old divorce and his love for Maya. His creation of a man seeking escape through his love of wine and his budding writing is glorious subtle and astonishing to watch. Thomas Haden Church is also brilliant as the rebellious and immoral Jack. He may have the best part, but he still brings a spirit of humanity to this foolish character. But it is Virginia Madsen who is the most brilliant supporting player in this film, creating the deliciously attractive, intelligent and beautiful Maya. Her performance is outstanding and was unlucky to come up against Cate Blanchett's Katherine Hepburn in The Aviator at this year's Oscars.The film is fantastic and certainly the best film of its kind since Sofia Coppola's ""Lost in Translation"" in 2003. It is a worthy modern classic.",Sideways

It became interesting, the screenplay was good, Miles was finally being honest even though his world seemed to fall apart even further and decided to be the bigger and better man.

217,bburns,"Sour and bland; could have used a ""Woody""-er flavor",6,20 March 2005,"From the first time I saw a preview of ""Sideways"", I had a sneaking suspicion that I wouldn't like it. I typically don't like talky films about self-centered elitists unless they are at least as funny as ""Hannah and Her Sisters"". None-the-less, I was willing to at least give it a chance several months after its initial release for three reasons. First, because Paul Giamatti is one of my favorite actors & richly deserving of the celebrity he finally got because of this film. Second, because it won the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay, and that honor typically goes to the film that actually deserves Best Picture. And third, because it was directed by Alexander Payne, who has never made a bad or dull movie. Until now.This movie has a very European sensibility about it, and I don't mean that as a compliment. Ever since a certain over-rated French misogynist put out a film called ""Breathless"", too many continental European & Canadian directors (as well as a handful of Americans) have decided that a movie that is actually *about* something is simply too gauche for people of taste. So instead they put out movies about dull people who have dull conversations about dull topics. And for some reason, critics fall all over themselves praising these movies. Now there are some movies in that style that are pretty good. But ""Sideways"" lacks verbal panache (e.g. ""Glengarry Glen Ross""), the understanding that the protagonist is full of it (e.g. ""The Mother and the Whore""), the self-awareness that this is a movie about nothing (e.g. ""Slacker""), or a riveting performance by a brilliant actor (e.g. ""Lost in Translation"").To summarize what little plot there is, two narcissistic, morally bankrupt guys--one a snobbish drunk writer (Giamatti), the other a hedonistic immature actor (Thomas Haden Church)--go on a tour of California's wine country and hook up with a couple of girls (Sandra Oh & Virginia Madsen) who share the writer's passion for wine.The main reason I think this movie fails is because Alexander Payne for the first time seems to align himself with the cultural snobs that make up most of his audience. Although ""Citezen Ruth"", ""Election"", and ""About Schmidt"" were largely art-house phenomena, the films themselves were tributes to the lower- and middle-class Midwesterners that are typically lampooned in other art-house comedies. In ""Sideways"", we don't see these salt-of-the-earth types until towards the end, and then only to set up an X-rated gag that demeans them.Another reason I didn't like it is because the movie was so concerned with being high-brow entertainment that it was rarely as funny as it should have been. There were moments in the film that I did enjoy, and they were all sight-gags. I wish there were more of those and fewer long-winded conversations that probably looked better on a printed page than they do coming out of the mouths of actors (at least Payne refrained from having his actors improvise all their lines, as is too often the case in films like this). Also, the chemistry between Giamatti & Church seemed a little too cliché'd. This particular dynamic has been used to better dramatic effect by Dylan Walsh & Julian McMahon in the TV series ""Nip/Tuck"" and infinitely better comic effect by Woody Allen & Tony Roberts in ""Annie Hall"". By splitting the difference between comedy & drama, they left not enough of either and took out much of the punch from the performances by both actors.Comedies about elitist snobs do have a place in the world of cinema, but if the screenwriter & director take the characters as seriously as the characters take themselves, then the movie will fail. And unless the script is as well-done as even a lesser Woody Allen movie, it probably should not be made. ""Sideways""--although watchable--fails on both counts. 6 out of 10.",Sideways

Unluckily the other nominees are too strong for it. I can say it is one of the best comedies in 2004. Maybe the best.But if you only take it as a funny movie, you are totally wrong. The most impressive part is Miles and Maya talked about drinking in Stephanie's house. The amazing conversation raised the whole level of the comedy. No doubt it is the best part of the film. These meaningful words really are worth you to think. Maybe you will change your attitude for life, if you really think.Of cause the wonderful performance of actors (actresses) can not be overlooked.

223,Derek237,Has one of the funniest lines ever,10,26 November 2005,"Alexander Payne's movies, though always thought provoking and well written, tend to have a vulgar side. Just when I thought seeing Kathy Bates get into a hot tub nude with Jack Nicholson in About Schmidt was the most outrageous thing I've seen in a mainstream drama/comedy, along comes Alexander Payne to top himself with another insane scene. Think of that part in Jurassic Park where the T-rex is right up against the car window with the terrified kids inside, replace the kids with Paul Giamatti and Thomas Hayden Church, replace the T-rex with a naked fat dude, and you get the general idea.Sideways has that perfect balance of comedy and drama, which I love to see in movies, since that's closest to how life really is. It can't be serious all the time, and it can't always be wacky and sit-comish either. It's the story of Miles and Jack's trip to wine country and all the little dramas that unfold during the few days. The acting was perfect by Giamatti, Hayden Church, Virginia Madsen, and Sandra Oh. Hayden Church in particular gives an excellent performance as the idiotic Jack. Everyone probably knows a ""Jack"" in their own life and I didn't think he was ever once unconvincing as this character. He's just a bit dim, he makes some pretty stupid decisions (most of which were made by his penis), and you actually end up pitying this poor fool.I also have to praise Sideways for one of my favourite movie lines/exchanges in recent years. It's right near the end, after all the excitement is just about over, and Jack decides to crash the car (to make it seem to his fiancé at home that he got his broken nose from a car accident and not from an enraged Sandra Oh who found out he was getting married). They had left some of the wine cases they had bought in the trunk of the car and when it crashed some of the bottles broke. Miles is clearly frustrated when he discovers this, while Jack just shrugs, ""Whatever."" Miles, angry, tired, and just generally fed up with their whole experience and Jack's carelessness snaps, ""No, no, it's not 'whatever,' you f***in' derelict!""My rating: 10/10",Sideways

225,CurtMan@LVCM.com,Sour Grapes,10,28 November 2004,"***POSSIBLE SPOILERS*** ""Sideways"" is an all around excellent film and story- a funny, endearing, entertaining concoction of human exploration, reflection, development, confusion... brilliantly acted, written and richly perfected in almost every respect: it's an irresistibly and brilliantly clever piece of genius. Following a frustrated and agitated, yet unusually eloquent and erudite ""wine expert"" (Paul Giamatti) and his virtual opposite shallow, gregarious, and hollow best friend (Thomas Haden Church), as they venture the fascinating and gorgeous California countryside touring wine factories, meeting and romancing women (though the latter is engaged), and reflecting on the bemusements of life, and experience a week's adventure different than either had anticipated. The former is delighted (albeit hardly ecstatic) about the prospects of his novel becoming published, and this scheme provides the two friends with a reason to celebrate, and as Jack (Church) explicitly phrases it: party and get laid. Miles (Giamatti) is very conscious, yet subdued, exploding with ideas yet adrift about his own seemingly pathetic existence. At one point he exclaims, ""I am nothing"" proceeding a very unfortunate series of events, and believes he is a ""smudge of excrement upon a skyscraper"". For Miles, this is a journey of self-exploration, enlightenment, and realization: he is unhappily divorced and tepid about becoming romantically involved with any woman, even with a woman who seems to take a remarkable fancy to him, and is his compliment in the knowledge of wine and its ineffable, brilliant design, taste and spirit. His precarious (engaged) friend Jack, on the other hand, encounters a waitress on their trip (Sandra Oh), and professes his ""dying love"" to her after merely a day of rather unadulterated acquaintance, and hardly takes a moment to reflect upon his ""love"", to whom he is about to marry. This is a remarkably clever and carefully structured character study- of realizing the importance of existence and placement in the world, and of seizing opportunities and making the very best of life, even when overwhelming adversities hardly enable one to appreciate happiness, much less, their own existence. The direction is sometimes adroitly concentrative, and often fragmented, in scenes of drama, and pertains to the sometimes mellow and facile, sometimes serious and consequential themes achieved by various happy and depressing circumstances. The writing is absolutely brilliant and very human: it covers practically every human emotion with all the adulteration, honesty, pragmatism, wit and wisdom you might imagine. There are scenes of hilarity (Jack getting scarred by his angry girlfriend, Miles retrieving his wallet) and scenes of depth and reflection (Maya reflecting on the values of wine, Miles relating his miseries and hapless existence to Maya), and ""Sideways"" is an all around beautiful, enjoyable, endearing, and wholly entertaining work of human character as developed by circumstance, decision, and fate. We feel compassion and sorrow for Miles because we realize his troubles are hardly his faults, and that his kindness and wisdom should be received more fairly than his existence allows. Kudos to Alexander Payne for an absorbing and adulterated screenplay, Thomas Haden Church for his genial and hilarious comic relief in his role as Jack, and Paul Giamatti in his insightful and neurotic performance as Miles, in a film that is guaranteed to be remembered and appreciated at the coming of Oscar season. ""Sideways"" is a truly wonderful ""slice of life"" masterpiece. **** out of ****",Sideways
226,Travis_Bickle01,Touching and honest story,9,27 July 2005,"Sixth movie from Alexander Payne, who also directed ""About Schmidt"" with Jack Nicholson and ""Election"" with Reese Witherspoon. In ""Sideways"" we see Paul Giamatti in one of the leading roles, who gives in an irreproachable way shape to the depressed and melancholic Miles. Miles is a man who doesn't succeed in getting over his divorce. He tries to write down his experiences and misery in a book but until now, no publisher was willing to publish it. Even by being on a trip with his best friend Jack and going out with the beautiful waitress Maya (they know each other already a couple of years), doesn't make him any happier.Sometimes Miles' awkwardness may seem a little funny, but most of the time you just feel sorry for him. The guy didn't knew much happiness in his life and it seems that everything he tries to do, just fails: his marriage, his writing,his whole life.Beautiful story and excellent acting performances by Paul Giamatti and Virginia Madsen. Madsen is wonderful as the vulnerable and broken waitress, desperately looking for a decent an honest man. Payne made again an excellent movie about lonely people, looking for some affection, just like Nicholson's character in ""About Schmidt"".9/10",Sideways
227,unakaczynski,Deep drama and incredible humor.,9,14 November 2005,"SidewaysThe first film I ever really noticed Paul Giamatti in was Howard Stern's ""Private Parts."" He played a real major asshole, so it was hard to like the guy. His character was so negative that I had a hard time liking the guy after that film! Finally, I've seen Sideways, and boy, was I wrong about this guy...This film revolves around middle-class wine connoisseur Milo played by Paul Giamatti who's taking a week-long trip through wine country (California) with his soon-to-be-married friend for his ""last week of freedom."" Of course, per the title of the film, the story quickly heads off in all directions except that one for which Milo had aimed.Here's the breakdown:The Good:--The acting is fantastic, some of the best out there. Powerful performances left and right, all led by Giamatti who's character has got to be one of the saddest in film history. The quivers in his voice, his apprehensiveness, his paranoia and lack of faith in himself--everything about his character comes through perfectly.--Excellent writing with some fantastic, and hilarious dialog.--Good music and great atmosphere.--Excellent chemistry among the characters.--Excellent humor in both dialog and actions.--A lot more sex-related material that I figured there would be--all very entertaining.--Brilliant drama and depth mixed with very enjoyable, and sometimes, downright hilarious humor.Didn't Hurt It, Didn't Help:--Some of the humor in this film doesn't come from necessarily funny dialog so much as it comes from the way in which that dialog is delivered. Often, it's very subtle, but nevertheless, incredibly funny. Listening to Giamatti's soon-married friend say things like, ""this chick wants to party with us, maaannn"" like a thick-headed college sophomore is just plain amusing. But, this kind of humor won't be for everyone.--The near-constant conversations about wine may drive some people batty. I for one, didn't understand really any of the conversations. However, that's not the point: It's the actions, dialog, and mannerisms which accompany the wine-laden conversations that we're to watch. That's what carry those conversations along. Not everyone will catch this, unfortunately.--I thought the music at times could've been better--something a little stronger to carry along those somewhat slow montages would've been nice. But aside from that--good, fitting music.The Bad:--Some lethargic pacing. It's meant to tell a story and to emphasize moods and emotions, but there are a couple montages that seem to drag along just a little too long. Seems some of them could've been done in a shorter time.The Ugly:--Fat hicks fvcking.Memorable Scene:--Fat hicks fvcking.--""I'm not drinking any FVCKING MERLOT!!""Acting: 10/10 Story: 9/10 Atmosphere: 9/10 Cinematography: 9/10 Character Development: 9/10 Special Effects/Make-up: 0/10 (none) Nudity/Sexuality: 4/10 Violence/Gore: 2/10 (very mild, brief violence) Sets/Backgrounds: 9/10 Dialogue: 10/10 Music: 9/10 Writing: 10/10 Direction: 10/10 Cheesiness: 0/10 Crappiness: 0/10Overall: 9/10 The only things that probably could've been improved were those somewhat slow montages. Aside from that, an excellent film. One of the best dramatic comedies (Dramedy?) out there. The humor won't be for everyone, but it's definitely worth checking out--you won't know if you like it until you see it. One of those movies that received a lot of praise--and deserved it.

229,sawyertom,No Way for Sideways.,1,17 June 2005,"This movie was one of those that the critics praised as great like the Piano,and American Beauty but in all actuality sucked. Highly praised and acclaimed and stunk. The movie was advertised as a comedy. My one question was, where was the humor? It was a humorless comedy.With the exception of Virginia Madsen's character, none of them were likable or sympathetic. Just pathetic. Paul Giamatti played a wine snob who looked down on somebody who waited tables and stole from his own mother. Great character he was. Haden Church played and man who was due to get married in a week and was out boning anything, especially Sandra Oh, right before his wedding. He even thinks about calling off the his wedding for this hot piece of @ss. Even after he suffers a broken nose from her finding out that he's getting married he's off after a fat waitress within a day or so. Nice guy that is. Why is this movie about two pathetic losers considered a funny comedy. I kept thinking this piece of crap would get better just like the Piano and American Beauty, needless to say it did not. Hollywood sure has a warped idea on what the rest of the country is like. As for me it's no way for sideways. No way is it funny. No way is it entertaining. No way is it worth watching. It is crap with a capital ""C""",Sideways
230,flickershows,"Too Much Whine, Not Enough Wine",7,1 January 2005,"Its some kind of minor tragedy that Paul Giamatti's newest film ('Sideways') has outgrossed and outbuzzed his best one ('American Splendor'). Writer/director Alexander Payne ('About Schmidt') and Giamatti heard all sorts of raves for their previous projects, but none of their prior success equals how the awards bodies are foisting kudos on 'Sideways'. Justified? No, but its been a weak year. If a solid, completely unspectacular film is the best we can hope for in 2004, no wonder this one is being knighted as the character study of the season.Odd-couple chums Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church (that hilarious scene-stealing lug) go on a Californian odyssey to drink good wine and sew some oats before Church's upcoming wedding. The men hook up with Sandra Oh and Virginia Madsen (over Giamatti's dead body). Church is happy to continually get his freak on with Oh, but Giamatti practically has to be bribed to make a move on Madsen, even though he's been carrying a torch for her for years. He's unhappily divorced and doesn't want to get hurt again. Madsen can relate to him, Church cannot.There you have it. It's a humorous thinkpiece where Thomas Haden Church is a funny fool, Virginia Madsen is touching, and Sandra Oh is effective. 'Sideways' is deliberately plot-free and it doesn't try to tie up every loose knot before the fade-out. We need more movies like that, but it didn't prevent me from growing sick of Giamatti's grousing after a while. He's too talented to keep playing this same glum sad-sack. And as odd as it is for someone who never drinks (wine) to say this---when it turns into a movie about a booty call, I started to miss the wine. 'Sideways' is certainly not a dud. It's just unremarkable.",Sideways
231,native_girl333,Bittersweet journey of two troubled men,10,26 June 2006,"""Sideways"" is clearly the best movie of the year 2004! It is an bubbly story of two friends (unbelievably funny pair Paul Giamatti and Thomas Hayden Church) who leave to the countryside to taste great wines and avoid the reality.Miles (Giamatti) is a little depressed and neurotic writer who has passion for good wine. He's best friend Jack is going to tie the knot with his bride Christine (Alysia Reiner). Before coming a husband the two friends want to enjoy their lives and the last bachelor days of Jack by heading off to the countryside. Miles has divorced couple of years backwards and Jack is eager to find a company for his suffering pal with intentions to fool around himself before entering the gates of marriage. Miles and Jack meet two women, Maya (Virginia Madsen) and Stephanie (The director's wife Sandra Oh) who are interested to having a good time with the men.The director/writer Alexander Payne has made some of the greatest movies about neurotic and narcissistic character (""About Schmidt"" and ""Election"") but ""Sideways"" is by a mile his best film ever. Payne made an intriguing script which won him an Oscar and it was very very well earned, indeed. ""Sideways"" reaches out to the middle-age problems of two troubled men who are on journey discovering themselves. The film is bittersweet and heart-aching story of love, wine and women. The story is fresh, funny, smart and deeply insightful. The dialog is embarrassingly blunt and raving hilarious. We want more of this! Self-pity and pathetic manners are two themes of the movie. Jack is so hedonistic and self-righteous but we will find out that he is as helpless as the rest of us. Miles represents the other side of the spectrum. If Jack is so cocky and proud Miles is narcissistic and a little pathetic side. In the end Miles is surely the winner. He is like the good wine; gets better and better in time.The actors are just brilliant. Giamatti and the supporting women were fantastic but who really blew me away was Thomas Hayden Church! There is a man who can handle both humor and drama so latently that you just watch him with your mouth open of the amazement! You can't help at feeling a bit sorry for the guy. But despite the fact that he is a little arrogant he is truly a likable and sweet character. The cinematography is so beautiful. Clever picturing makes the story of Miles and Jack become a true journey of self discovery. The magnificent nature and Napa Valley breeze makes the trip feeling most enjoyable.When I watched the movie I laughed so hard that I had to tame myself. It is so various and just mind-blowing. After seeing the movie you feel like smiling so much people will wonder what happened to this person. If only they would make more of this kind of films!Thank you Mr.Payne! You made my day!",Sideways
232,ryanpersaud-59415,"Sweet, Bodied and Leaves an Impression",10,15 September 2021,"The Good: Alexander Payne does it again and honestly, this may be his best movie. Sideways is so effortlessly fun, charming and entertaining; it's how you know it took true talent to do it. The writing is amazing here; the characters crackle with humanity, it's subtle (spending so much of the film NOT talking about what's actually happening) and so, so entertaining. Giamatti and Church have so much incredible chemistry; it feels like they've been friends for ages before the film even starts. The plot is so unexpected and interesting too; it's wacky and hilarious, but also grounded in reality.Oh, and the scenery is amazing. I can honestly say I didn't care for going on a wine tour...before watching this movie. Its depictions of Californian wine country is so good, the State should have paid them.The Bad: You literally cannot watch this movie without a bottle of wine. You just can't. The way wine is discussed in this movie will turn the most jaded abstainer curious.The Ugly: This movie is just...so joyful. It's a dark comedy, to be sure.

233,JimD73,"Incredible Acting, Interesting Characters and Some Laugh-Out-Loud Moments Equal A Movie That Works Wonders",9,16 May 2005,"PLOT: 23/25: Jack (Church) is a washed up actor who is about to get married. His old college roommate and best man, middle-school English teacher Miles (Giamatti), who was divorced two years previously and has spent the time since excessively depressed, takes him out to travel the wine country of California. What Miles hopes to be a classy send-off for his friend is turned upside down when Jack reveals that he wants this week to not be about the wine, but about getting laid as many times as possible before he walks down the aisle, and try to get Miles out of his depression. Meanwhile, Miles is waiting for word whether a publisher will take on his first novel. Telling them that they are celebrating Miles getting his book published, Jack takes out wine connoisseur Stephanie (Oh), along with her waitress friend Maya (Madsen) for Miles. However, once Jack becomes involved with Stephanie, he begins to second guess his marriage and Miles must cope while all hell breaks loose around him.Okay, that description does not do the plot justice. Basically, to sum up the plot in one sentence, it is about two men who learn the lessons of life in one week on the road. It works very well, despite the movie not being so much about the situations but more about the characters themselves. They are never portrayed as being whole people like in most movies, but as incredibly flawed, simple people. Jack just wants random sex before marriage, and Miles is unable to pick himself out of the gutter he drank himself into. They both eventually get a swift kick in the ass, in one way or another, but these are not characters that you can think of with high regards. These people are not your everyday protagonist. These are people, however, that even at their best and their worst, are definitely only human.Of course, they manage to get themselves into some pretty tough situations.COMEDY: 20/25: Sideways can be very funny at times. I was laughing out loud on numerous occasions. However, I wouldn't call it a comedy per se. Sure, it was funny, but there is a much deeper purpose than simply laughter.Most of the comedy comes from Thomas Haden Church bouncing off of Paul Giamatti. Kind of an odd situation as Giamatti is usually the one filling that role. The great thing about the humour is that it does seem real. It isn't some wacky type stuff that you know would never really happen, or so subtle it goes unnoticed. This seems more real than other humour, and it makes it more genuinely funny.ACTING: 25/25: If there is any category I can guarantee everyone can unanimously agree on, it is this. The acting in Sideways is phenomenal from the four leads. Giamatti (American Splendor) was unfairly robbed of an Oscar nomination. He perfectly portrays the deeply depressed character that Miles is and, despite him being something of a scumbag, is very easy to identify with.Thomas Haden Church (""Wings"") is essentially the opposite of Giamatti. He is the party animal void of sophistication. When he learns his lessons of life, Church shines. He well deserved his Oscar nomination. Also, kudos to the casting people for casting a washed-up actor as a washed-up actor.Virginia Madsen (The Hot Spot) has one excellent scene, and while that scene is what she is remembered for here, she is great through the rest of the film as well. Sandra Oh (""Grey's Anatomy"") is well chosen for her role. The acting just succeeds on all levels.ENTERTAINMENT: 23/25: There is really very little, if anything, to dislike about Sideways. I can see everyone with enough sense to appreciate this type of movie to really enjoy this. I highly recommend it.TOTAL: 91%: Out of the four Best Picture nominees I have seen, I would say that Sideways is only surpassed by Ray. It has some incredible acting, interesting characters and some laugh out loud moments. If you aren't the type who will shun any movie without explosions or fart jokes, this movie will work wonders for you.",Sideways

Not to mention the obsessive details and references about wine production throughout the film.There might be some good human character studies (in particular the contrast between the behavior of the two protagonists), and portrayal of suburban life (mostly in the sequence of Miles' mother's birthday), but they're completely lost amidst this nonsense.Excellent performance by Paul Giamatti, but not enough to save this trivial film.",Sideways

Sure, the acting was fine and the technical work by the crew was top, but for me it was the overall story that let it down. An over-full glass of wine appreciation and a seemingly bottomless glass of overdone mini wine support meetings pair and quartet discussions let it down heavily for me.

236,LilyDaleLady,Anybody else read THE BOOK?,2,20 December 2005,"""Sideways"" was one of those movies that was (slightly) spoiled for me because I read and saw so much about it before I was able to view it for myself (as a rental). I'd heard such wonderful and amazing things that I was prepared to see a very, very special movie. Therefore, I can't really say with any accuracy how much I would have liked the film if I had seen it ""cold"".Additionally, since I waited such a long time to view it, I was able in the meanwhile to read the novel of the same name it is based on (by Rex Pickett). With all the reviews, both positive and negative, I have to wonder if any other reviewers here did this. Film Buffs of the World, hear this: you can learn a lot about a movie from reading the novel it is based on!That being said, I don't feel that a movie is the same as a novel (or a play). I can't and don't expect a film to replicate, word for word, scene for scene, a book. For starters, it isn't possible -- filming every single scene of a book would make every film based on a written work into a 12 part mini-series. Also, a book is not necessarily better than a film, and I can think of a number of films which are much better than the books they are based on.So back to ""Sideways"": I don't know that the novel is actually better than the film, but it makes more sense. Things that reviewers question in the film are answered easily in the novel, and could have been dealt with in the film with a word or two. Alexander Payne took so many liberties with the film that it's almost the opposite of the novel, rather than a condensed version of it.Some examples: in the film, Miles is a balding, homely nebbish of about 45. In the novel, he is quite a good looking man in his 30s, lots of hair and plenty of self-esteem, and he finds it easy to flirt with women. In the film, Miles is a schoolteacher with an unfinished book he is trying to write. In the novel, Miles was once a somewhat successful scriptwriter, who is temporarily broke. In the film, Miles and Jack are old friends...former college roommates who have a 20 year history together. In the novel, Miles and Jack only met a few years back, on a film where Miles wrote the script and Jack was acting.In the film, Miles is a ""wine connoisseur"", who occasionally gets tipsy while enjoying his hobby. In the novel, it is VERY VERY CLEAR that Miles is an alcoholic, who is denying his addiction by telling himself that he is a wine hobbyist, and not a drunk. BTW: an important detail left out of the film is the definition of the word ""sideways"": it means someone is falling over, dead drunk.In the film, Jack is an aging, sort of unsuccessful actor with a rich fiancé. In the novel, Jack is a successful actor who is wealthy in his own right.In the film, Miles is fully employed as a schoolteacher, but chooses (for unexplained reasons) to rob his loving, middle-class mother of $1000 so he can go on the trip (which is a perfectly horrible thing to do, never questioned or dealt with in the script). In the novel, Miles is unemployed and about to be evicted...he takes $1000 from his extremely wealthy mother who lives in a posh house with a swimming pool, and who has a safe full of Kruggerands...furthermore, the money is to save his apartment from eviction, not to take a trip.In the film, Stephanie (Sandra Oh) is a 40-ish Asian single mother, with a bi-racial child and desires a serious relationship. In the novel, the character is a blonde, sexy 20-something ""wild child"", with no child, who is out for fun.In the film, Maya (a radiant Virginia Madsen, in a career-making performance) is a wonderful, grounded, serious woman who falls in love with Miles. In the novel, Maya is basically a prostitute, who is paid a thousand dollars by Jack to seduce Miles, and perform oral sex on him in a hot tub.You can see that these are not simple changes to the script, to shorten the story for the big screen or to merely clarify the actions of the characters -- these are radical re-writes which entirely change the theme and the story to the point where the original novel scarcely exists and the story that remains almost does not make sense.Despite lovely cinematography, and two very special performances by Sandra Oh and Virginia Madsen, I have to vote thumbs down on this self-indulgent film. My take on it was that the changes were made to flatter the egos of male audience members (especially reviewers, who are often unpublished authors themselves) who adore the idea that a homely schlub can attract a stunningly beautiful woman, even when he is broke and talentless and drunk. The novel is the story of an alcoholic ruining his already messed up life -- the film is a ""life affirming"" story of a nebbish who miraculously gets the prettiest girl in the room.Conclusion: one of the most overrated and overpraised films I have seen in many years.",Sideways
237,Foxbarking,Very Overrated,4,4 March 2005,"I seem to be in the huge minority of people who did not care for this movie. I went into it expecting an awesome film, and left wondering what this movie offered me. I think it's a travesty that this film ranks in the top 250 on this site.Now, I am someone who appreciates a good movie and a good wine. As a former director, I have very high film standards. And for me, Sideways did nothing to meet those standards. The film was very clumsy and was at no point ever sure where it was going. It was supposed to be a bachelorhood romp into the wine country. Instead, it seemed like the characters never could get into the fun. Their days were very humdrum until the one guy starts having the affair.The scene where the main character steals money from his mom further complicates the movie. Obviously, this is showing us a lot about the character. He doesn't have enough of his own money to live off of. And he is sleazy enough to steal money from his mother. It's a bad way to start off with this character and it made me lose all sympathy for him. Also, if the man doesn't have any money, how can he afford to be such a wine connoisseur? Wine is a pretty expensive hobby.After the first 45 minutes, I almost walked out of the theater. I was bored with the storyline, which appeared to go nowhere. I didn't feel any closeness with the characters. Why should I care about a man who steals from his mother and another who cheats on his fiancée.The only part of this movie I enjoyed was the scene where Giamatti's character steals the wallet back. It was the only decent laugh in the whole movie.For people who say Paul Giamatti was robbed, I can't disagree more. His performance was nothing special. It definitely could not compare to the actual Oscar nominees. I would have been more shocked if he was nominated. And don't give me a line about how understated his character was. I like understated characters and will always state that Tom Wilkinson's performance in ""In The Bedroom"" should have won the Oscar the year it was nominated.But even though I hated this movie, I can't say I don't recommend it. Most people who see it seem to like it, so chances are that if you like an understated comedy, you may enjoy it. It just didn't work for me.",Sideways

240,danjakubik,"A rare and original, honest comedy about midlife.",10,5 April 2010,"""Sideways"", 2004, contains a number of unusual, special and admirable qualities, not typical of the comedy film genre. Most importantly, it contains one of the best screenplays of any film of the decade, convincing, believable characters and situations. The film is done in a low key, mellow, relaxed style, using a soft jazz music score as background, and evokes the laid back Southern California lifestyle. The story is a week in the life of two middle aged college friends going out on a wine tasting tour of California, just before one of them is to be married.The film comes across as very natural and genuine, like one really met and interacted with the characters, as people in real life. That's a big compliment to the abilities and talent of the director, writer and actors. Film editing is quite good, if subdued. The restaurant meeting scene with the four main characters of the film, contains an example of excellent, creative film editing. It's one of the most genuine scenes in the film and one of several favorite scenes of mine in the film as a whole. I would describe ""Sideways"" as a very honest, natural comedy that feels real. I consider it a modern comedy classic. I always enjoy the relaxed and natural quality of this film.

241,jhsteel,"Worth the effort, if you are sensitive enough.",9,26 August 2005,"This movie seems to elicit extreme opinions at both ends of the spectrum. I am at the positive end, because it resonated with me enormously. It showed the contrast between two men; Jack- an insensitive overgrown teenager having a final fling before getting married, and Miles - a sensitive self-absorbed loser whose life is getting worse. The contrast is brought out in their relationships with the two women, and the urgent rush into infidelity by Jack and the hesitant approach of Miles and Maya that pays off. I loved the emotional content of Miles and Maya's relationship, one that has to bring hope to lonely people - never give up.I think that those who have condemned this movie have had different life experiences or have little patience with people who struggle. Entering into the situations of the characters is very rewarding. I know nothing about wine, don't even drink it, but the pretentiousness of the wine-talk was funny and oiled the wheels of the story.",Sideways
242,JAKastner,The Moose Hole - 'Sideways' is Like Life Itself,9,10 February 2005,"The story for Sideways, though concentrating itself within an entirely different time period and character actions, vaguely resembles the philosophical critiques described by Voltaire in his novel, Candide, minus the social commentaries, though argument could be made for that as well. On the one hand you have Miles, a two-year divorcée who always seems to have an adverse view of the world, even when it feels as if he may finally be receiving that little break for once. Despite the opportunity to be with a woman presenting itself to him, it feels as if he can not bare to expose himself to another woman out fear of rejection and the universe punching him in the stomach one more time. On the opposite end of the spectrum is Jack, Miles' old college roommate and best friend, who happens to be on his way to becoming a married man for the first time. With almost the exact opposite philosophy as his melancholy friend, Jack is always searching for a good time and views nearly every situation with a positive spin to it, even if, logically, there should be none. If life happens to throw him a curveball, thus knocking him down off his high horse, he simply picks himself off the ground, dusts the dirt off his pants, and then hightails it after the next short skirt that comes waltzing by his line of sight. What Sideways demonstrates, the novel Candide as well, is that as human beings we need not apply to either one of these extremist theories on how we should view the world but rather we should instead discover a compromise in between in which we continue life being happy and content with what we have.Paul Giamatti, having been backhanded by the Motion Picture Academy once again, performs brilliantly in the role of Miles Raymond, a man who goes out to wine country to give his best friend his last hoorah and ends up finding himself in the process. As with Jack, certain audience members may find Miles to be a bit too pessimistic and cynical of his view of the world to find him all that likable. But what needs to be remembered is that this is the nature of Miles' character and as the story digs deeper into his personal failures and dead-end streets in his life, the more understanding we become of his current philosophy in life. There is this immensely romantic sequence within the film in which Maya discusses the feeling she has or the thoughts she develops in her mind whenever she drinks a bottle of wine. As she delivers this exceptionally beautiful piece of dialogue, Miles appears nothing short of captivated by her words, feeling as if she has already grasped who he is inside. And then comes the precise moment in that scene where you will want to grab Miles by the shoulders, slap his face around a bit, and shout, ""Kiss her you moron"" only to no avail. Jack, played hilariously by Thomas Haden Church, is without a doubt one of the most unlikable characters you will come across. He is loud, crude, embarrassingly sexually promiscuous, and arrogant beyond all pretension. But those rather coarse traits aside, he does happen to have his moment in which, once you are able to get past the excessive profanity and sexual innuendos, he speaks quite profoundly on certain subjects as when he attempts to have Miles lighten for once in his life after he finds out his wife has remarried. Virginia Madsen, in the role of Maya, is nothing short of breathtakingly eloquent and beautiful in this film, performing admirably opposite Paul Giammati and never once playing off dialogue as clichéd as it would sound coming from anyone else with less experience then she has.Overall, no matter how young or old you happen to be, whether you are male or female, you will be able walk away from Sideways with a new view on life, on how we need not be overtly optimistic or pessimistic but instead be content with what life gives us and work with it while we still have time. For those moviegoers who have yet to even approach what one would call the 'prime age-range' for a midlife crisis, the film's underlying themes on the 'crossroads' in our lives and how we should view the world are still particularly poignant and divulge valuable lessons that can easily be applied in the future. Praise is well-deserved for this generation's new odd-couple, Paul Giammati and Thomas Haden Church. Each of their characters has individual qualities, whether they be good or bad, that play off so brilliantly off each other that it is purely entertaining to watch them interact on screen. And sure, there are bound to be those audience members who have failed to grasp the concepts developed in this film and will therefore complain about how there was no ""true"" ending, just a lousy cliffhanger. In the same light as the conclusion to Mile's unpublished book, the ending is whatever you want to make of it to be. There is no right or wrong answer, but if we follow what has happened to Miles' up until this point, we can as debate over what we would want to happen. As in true life, not everything is certain and Sideways' ending is exactly that.",Sideways
243,RARubin,Good Buddy Laugh,8,16 June 2005,"Sideways won an Academy Award for best Adaptation. I have heard the frustration in reviews from folks that don't like wine lovers, Lost In Translation, or wry, witty situations. They want belly laughs, feces jokes, more naked people, or less naked people.I didn't care for Paul Giamatti in American Slender. This had less to do with Giamatti than my own distaste for characters and screenplays that whine about the human condition. In Sideways, I got over it. Giamatti is a very fine actor. If you want to see the difference between good acting and poor, see Adam Sandler in Spanglish and then Giamatti in Sideways. It's a revelation.The events of our buddy movie seem a bit stretched, especially the lost wallet scenes, which though funny, couldn't actually happen. Drowning your sorrow in wine, that could happen and most of the film is pinned on the idea that two opposites from their college days could drive around picturesque wine country, get drunk, get laid, and in one character at least, learn something about the grueling trials of manly life. Sideways is not perfect, but it does have a nutty, aromatic, fruity bouquet.",Sideways
244,highclark,"White Lies, Red Wines10/10.",10,10 February 2005,"It's the attention to the smallest of details that puts 'Sideways' above the other Oscar nominated films released this year. The attention to detail starts from its inspired casting of the four principal actors. Namely, the now twice ignored by the Academy: Paul Giamatti. Giamatti plays Miles Raymond, a middle school teacher and budding novelist who is embarking on a 'week long bachelor party of two' with his soon to be married best friend, Jack (Thomas Haden Church). Miles is not only Jack's designated driver and wine tasting mentor, he is more importantly Jack's alibi provider for a weeks worth of wine and women. This means that Miles will provide for Jack's fiancé enough white lies to keep Jack an honest man until his wedding day. Whether he's telling lies to Jack's fiancé at the start of film, or telling lies to Jack's fiancé by the end of the film, Miles has to keep up appearances for Jack's sake. In between episodes of white lies, there is lots of wine tasting in the car on the trip up, wine sampling at many different vineyards and wine drinking in restaurants.The film starts to develop into something more than a 'mid-life crisis/buddy-buddy' movie once Miles and Jack become involved with two women, Stephanie (Sandra Oh) and Maya (Virginia Madsen). Again, the little white lies are deemed necessary for the progress of any sexual relations to take place, mainly for Jack and Stephanie. The lies work like a charm for Jack at first, but for Miles and Maya, things progress with much difficulty. Miles even has a hard time exaggerating a positive spin for his novel, even though Jack had lied that Miles' book was going to be published.Throughout the awkward courting process Miles looks incredibly ill at ease, especially when having to keep up with the lies already in motion. Miles can't articulate to Maya his angst into the spoken word any better than he can fit written words into a crossword puzzle. It's not until Miles can find the truth about himself, through a touching monologue where he obliquely describes himself as a fragile type of grape in need of the right care, that Miles and Maya connect.Maya solidifies their bonding when she counters Miles' monologue with one of her own. Maya reveals to Miles that she often wonders when drinking a good glass of wine, what the weather was like the day the grape was picked, or if it's an old wine, whether the people who picked the grapes are still alive. When Maya finishes her thought, Miles has the look of a man in love. It is the best scene of the year, in any movie.However, this is a movie that people will either love or dislike a lot. 'Sideways' is this year's 'Lost In Translation'. If you don't have the time for subtlety, you won't like it. I'm thinking back to when Miles goes in and out of focus while 'dialing drunk'. The scene conveys clearly what is seldom clear to the dialer who 'dials drunk'. This scene is a stroke of genius. After that scene, with its superb attention to detail, I am not surprised when I see Miles a little later correcting a liquor store cashier by pointing out that he doesn't just want a copy of 'Barely Legal', he wants the 'latest copy' of 'Barely Legal'. Miles knows his porn and his pinot noir.However, for those who can take or leave scenes of subtlety in your movies, there are still many great and grand comedic turns and over the top laughs, most notably the 'fake car crash' scene and of course the amazing and somewhat climactic 'wallet retrieval' scene. I found the 'wallet' scene to be very reminiscent of the hilariously tense 'Sister Christian' scene from 'Boogie Nights'.Not to put one movie against another, but I have a bad feeling that the Academy is not going to be kind to 'Sideways'. I hope the following doesn't appear too bitchy, butThere's no doubt that Paul Giamatti was slighted by the Academy in not receiving an Oscar nomination. Not only would I have considered Giamatti's performance good enough for a nod, I would placed him in the top two to win the Oscar. This oversight is a stain on this year's award.Thomas Haden Church was so great as Jack, that at times you could say he just about stole the movie from Giamatti. Church and Giamatti worked very well together, they had a fantastic chemistry. I could see the Academy throwing the Oscar his way. But it wouldn't taste right with Giamatti not even getting a nod.But here is where the Academy should make up for the snubbing of Giamatti and quite possibly with Church. The Best Supporting Actress Oscar will more than likely go to Virginia Madsen. I can't see it going to any of the other nominees, except perhaps Cate Blanchet. Yes, Cate Blanchet did a fine job nailing down the mannerisms and speech of a young Katherine Hepburn. Yes, her performance is very much Oscar worthy, just not for this year.It is the calm and inspired performance by Madsen that adds a beautiful, honest and assured center to the crazy, manipulative and angst-ridden ride by her male counterparts. This year the Oscar belongs to Virgina Madsen. If she doesn't win the Oscar, then it will have to be her unlikely comeback into a roll of a lifetime that will have to suffice. Some actors never get the chance to play the role of a lifetime. Virginia Madsen made this role the role of a lifetime. Let's hope the Academy, after missing the chance to award Giamatti with a nod, finally makes good by paying attention to the details.Clark Richards---10/10.",Sideways

247,segacs,Some good parts but slow and a bit annoying,6,6 February 2005,"The typical movie formula is to make your main characters the good guys, so the audience will root for them. Most movies do this, and it usually works quite well. A more challenging alternative is to make the main characters the bad guys, so that people who find themselves sympathizing with them have to take a long hard look at themselves. TV shows like the Sopranos do this very well and, if done right, it can also work.But in ""Sideways"", a third and entirely different alternative is employed: make the main characters annoying. Sure, they're meant to be neurotic and true to life. But instead of identifying with them, I merely found myself wanting to throw something at their heads.""Sideways"" is in many respects a very good movie. The dialogue is realistic and you get a sense that this movie is about real people, not movie stars pretending to be real people. It's funny, probably because it doesn't try too hard to be funny. Real life isn't a laugh track timed every 30 seconds, and ""Sideways"" gets its humour from the unexpected, out-in-left-field moments.Unfortunately, the funny parts are too few and far between. What's left is a movie that is pretty slow, grating, and about twice the length it needed to be. Sure, you get a true sense of these characters, but if you knew them in real life you'd probably do your best to avoid them.With all the raves about Sideways, I have to disagree with the pack somewhat. In some places this is a brilliant film and there are some definite comedic gems - particularly in a certain scene involving a certain nude male chasing a car - but in other places it just drags on. This movie could have easily made its point in a half hour less time.Basically, this movie is an updated and much less stylish Swingers.

This film is for adults. The pace--which some called slow and boring--is just right for this film, like the pace you would take to stroll through a winery in California.Paul Giamatti was robbed. His performance is exemplary, although his character is a lout. But the strange thing is, he knows he's a lout. Thomas Haden Church's character seems to be modeled on all those So Cal guys you see on ""Blind Date."" His performance was hilarious in some parts, and effectively dramatic in others. He's definitely a jerk, but has no remorse about his actions as he selfishly attempts to get laid as much as possible before his wedding.I must admit, I had the hots for Virginia Madsen in the 80's and she seemed to have fallen off the planet, so it was nice to see her back in a film that was a hit. Her speech about wine in Stephanie's house was very moving and sweet.This film is a big lesson for Hollywood: you don't need a loud soundtrack, a bunch of miscast 20-somethings and a bunch of CGI.

The writing, acting and directing are top notch. Paul Giammetti is excellent as the wine snob, self loathing Miles. Thomas Haden Church is a hoot as Jack, the groom to be who is determined to sleep his way through wine country on the eve of his impending nuptials.

253,Surecure,A brilliantly original comedy,9,29 June 2005,"Sideways is one of those rare adult comedies that blends intelligent writing with fantastic performances, all crafted beautifully by a talented director. From the very beginning it is obvious that this film is unlike any other and it remains at this level throughout its entirety. Payne's adaptation is not heavy-handed and he shows mature restraint in the presentation, which is what makes all the difference in intelligent comedy.It is not often that main characters are both fundamentally flawed and endearing at the same time and it is difficult for any director and cast to achieve. However, Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church bring such life to their roles that one cannot help be fascinated with their plights even as they prove themselves to be devoid of morality. From drunk driving and obnoxious antics in public places, to womanizing and presenting a completely false image of themselves, these characters offer little to be liked. But, the intensity and emotional fragility that Giamatti and Church bring to the roles offer a depth that could not be matched by lesser actors in the same roles.As a director, Alexander Payne understands how to present the characters and situations in a light where the actions taken will be understood, if not fully accepted by the audience. Added to this, Virginia Madsen's understated performance is a perfect counterpoint to the onslaught of the two leads and she anchors the reality of the film perfectly. As brilliant as the performances by Giamatti and Church are, it is Madsen's performance that ultimately frames the story and gives it a deeper complexity.Sideways is easily the best adult comedy to come along in years and well deserving as a contender for the best picture of 2004. Any fan of well written, adult geared comedy will appreciate this gem.",Sideways
254,Paddy-49,No man is an island...,9,2 March 2005,"SIDEWAYS (2004) Paul Giamatti, Thomas Haden Church, Virginia Madsen, Sandra Oh. (DIR: Alexander Payne) This is one of those films which ever so gradually creeps up on you as you watch it until it grabs you hard and won't let go. With Hollywood often (wrongly in my view) accused of only making movies with big names, big sets and big ""stories"" it is refreshing to see and thoroughly enjoy a film which has none of these. The performances are as honest as they are understated. Thomas Haden Church's Jack is an utterly believable Don Juan with the morals of a rat and the sensitivity of a two ton truck. And yet you can't help liking him. Paul Giamatti as Miles has all the insecurities (and some) all men of his age facing mid life crises. The stunningly beautiful Virginia Madsen, scarred by a failed marriage and a little lost, is just wonderful as Maya and is probably the character that you are most rooting for and want to be happy. Sandra Oh's Stephanie is kooky and slightly scary but proves to be as vulnerable as all the other leading characters. Vulnerability is the lead motif of the movie with all of the characters incomplete in some way (as we all are in real life I think).Sideways really does run the full gamut of emotions and very often you don't know whether to laugh or cry  indeed the characters themselves are always teetering along the brink between depression and elation. The golf scene is so funny that it had me hollering out loud  but again its denouement (when Jack charges up the fairway to threaten the fourball behind who had driven a ""hurry up"" ball at them) is wonderfully manic.Is there a moral from Sideways? I'm not sure that there is. Perhaps (without being too pretentious about it) it is Donne's ""No man is an island"". Alone each of the characters is vulnerable, weak, confused but put them with others and their personalities and their potential are realised (for better or worse). Sam North in his article on Road Movies says about Sideways that ""It's an escape from reality into unreality, but oddly enough, given their ages, it is also a coming of age picture. The road, as often stated, educates us, makes us face up to who we are and what we are escaping."" I think that is very incisive and that Sideways is a classic of the road movie genre. It is also quite un-modern, by which I mean that although it is of the new millennium it could actually have been made at any time in the last thirty years or so. It is not a film that reflects the times we live in as a film that reflects the human condition at almost any time. Superb.",Sideways

It is a perfect film for people who are rather well educated, who bemoan current excesses and talk about a loss of cultural values...but from a ""liberal"" perspective. For people who are not really doing what they love because of their need to earn a living. Who have figured out some kind of culturally relativistic, zeitgeist-y explanation for same. Who have developed some kind of obsessional ""hobby"" as a way of not dealing with the feeling of emptiness and anomie that comes out of a life based on being a sellout. The perfect poster for this film would have had paintings of the characters, schleppy as they are, but in some kind of mockery of a '40's pose, with It Doesn't Suck! written in big bold letters on top. This is a film whose entire cache is based on the fact that it doesn't suck. It has nothing outstanding about it, but it has a beginning, middle and end and some sort of sense of flow. Nowadays this is so rare in American middle of the road films that it has created some sort of undeserved mystique around this film. If you must watch this sort of film, In The Bedroom or You Can Count On Me are far superior. OK, they're not comedies...far from it. But they also possess a deep Not Sucking quality as their main strong point. Once again (and I hate to be so Frankfurt School about it, but when they're right, they're right), in a mainstream American film you are allowed to be some kind of intellectual, as long as you are either mediocre or a failure.",Sideways

This ranks right up there, and probably ahead of, Ray, Motorcycle Diaries, and Collateral (it might be heresy to compare it to The Passion of Christ). It definitely the finest comedy I've seen, so it is at least number one in that category and some say that category is the hardest to be good at (once you get past puppet sex and fart jokes). The funny thing is that the movie is so much more than that, in that it sneaks in existential and romantic plot lines for good measure.By the way, I am not some studio stooge. I am an attorney in NorCal. I happened upon this movie almost by accident. I bought a ticket to After The Sunset (crappy diamond heist waste of time) because I wanted to see something and that was the only thing that started when I showed up at the Dublin Imax theater, and walked out after Woody Harrelson inexplicably shot a shark, and went into this movie since it was starting and Ebert recommended it on Leno the night before. I was simply amazed.The story and directing are tight, with a lot of themes packed into the movie, but not so many you lose track of them. Kudos to the director for developing so many characters that you cared about (usually they develop only one or two and the rest are just faceless characteratures).All the actors did exceptionally well, but Paul Giamatti plays his character with unparalleled excellence. Expressive, funny, sad, you name it, he pulls it off. I DARE YOU to find a character he has played that you can't remember. Private Parts (""WWWWWWNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNBC""/Pig Vomit), Saving Private Ryan (""I've got ankles like an old woman""), the Negotiator (as whiny petty thief loser/hostage); Planet of the Apes (dirtbag orangutan human trader), and last but not least as ""Veal Chop"" in Safe Men.

Seriously though, these four perennial adolescents are a hoot and a holler, spoiled and sans a clue. And how can that equate a serious contemplation of middle-aged American angst? Unless this is satire, that is. Bottom line: All those lovingly lingering long shots of cultured, literally, vineyards, wherever they were, and apparently NOT in the Napa/Mendocino environs if I recollect my Southland geography, is more than countervailed by the vapid vapidities of the vintage-loving quartet. Oh, and Church's character sipping vintage? But his inventive genius for rationalization provided the laugh highlight of the movie, when the convertible missed the tree and rolled into the gully. Now, THAT is ""reality"" without a doubt. Or glass in hand.",Sideways
268,elitt,"Everything you'll ever need to know about wine and probably never care either, but the film works",9,17 December 2004,"This is one of those independent films that should be pretentious and boring. It's about two characters in different part of their lives and careers. One is about to get married while the other is still getting over a divorce. The two of them go out on a week long road trip to Northern California to play golf and taste wine. Miles (Paul Giamatti) is the best man and a wine expert but he is also basically a lush, while his buddy Jack (Thomas Haden Church) actually has no interest in wine at all, but wants to get laid instead. The little wine back drop works well in this film because it gives Miles something to get excited about and it also works as sort of a metaphor throughout the whole film. You also learn from Miles and other characters more than you'll ever care to know about wine. I'm not a wine drinker, but I didn't get bored with all the wine talk. The wine was used as a funny prop as the film went on.Miles the character is a sad sack. He isn't a bad guy at all, but he isn't really Prince Charming as he lies a little bit and does steal some money from his old mother. Jack on the other hand is more your atypical lying cheat. He also is basically a decent guy, but Miles knows he can't really be trusted and is very prone to getting into trouble. Like the film, ""Swingers"", you have two guys who are on a trip where one is trying out his last conquests before matrimony and the other has very little confidence and can't hook up with a chick.But hooking up is something they eventually do. Jack hooks up with a loose single mom (Sandra Oh) and Miles finally finds a compatible woman in Mia (Virginia Madsen). The relationships are dishonest for both of them, but it's an eye opener for Miles as he finally begins to get over his divorce.The writing is terrific. It's very funny and very mainstream as well. It's a buddy picture essentially, but it works very well and that is in part to it's extraordinary performances by Giamatti and Church. The last thing I saw Chuch in was the TV show ""Wings"". I was surprised how good he was. It's Giamatti's show, though. Look for Oscar nominations for him and Church.Alexander Payne did ""About Schmidt"", a film I didn't care for. But he also did ""Election"", a film I liked a lot. He uses some very subtle but very funny humor in his movies. This film isn't a laugh a minute, but it is funny, and he doesn't cross any broad line where the film loses it's focus. It's really an enjoyable film and this guy you really want to pull for.

I can not say it better so I will limit my review to a couple of comments and observations. a_franklin says that if you genuinely enjoyed this movie you should be ashamed of yourself. I wouldn't quite put it like that, but the sentiment is this: If you did, you should take a chance and look into the reasons why you enjoyed it. Chances are, you looked past many, many things. I think about them and it makes me sick. Oh, by the way, the film sucks too. People enjoy films for many reasons, actors, realism, aesthetics, even just given the chance to feel something for a change. Anything. I'm convinced that Americans look to entertainment to have meaningful experience. If you live in the states, you can't argue otherwise. The story's meaning is atrocious. There really isn't one complete unit of meaning in this film, but if you put all the pieces together, it's pretty scary.The fact that it was nominated for an academy award is even scarier.

270,abyoussef,"A Glorious Vintage. May It Age As Well As ""Citizen Kane.""",10,2 April 2009,"by Dane Youssef ""Sideways"" is one of those movies that seems to be made entirely for the scholarly and intellectual. The artsy, deep, hip and high-brow. Films about those people going through a turning point in their lives. Mid-life crisis's and the like. And ones like this in particular always seem to reap critical praise, a crowd of fervent fans and prestigious award nominations.The movie uses wine and wine country as a backdrop, yes, but the movie is about more than just the symbolism of wine and it's drinkers. It's essentially about people who are connected and realize how hard, brief and fragile life itself is and pursue happiness by any means necessary. And they're so true and worthy of it, we want them to find it and thus, assure we will find it ourselves. It has the mixed feeling of life.It's stars, Miles Richmond and Jack Lopate have been buddy-buddy since their college dorm years. And have always been (and will be) total polar opposites. Miles is just a sad-sack neurotic nebbish with a bundle of neuroses that seem unwilling to disappear no matter how much therapy or medication he can get his hands on. His book won't get sold, his ex-wife is remarried (not that Miles was happy with her), he seems to be closer to death than life and he hasn't made an iota of the impact he wanted to.Jack's a less-than-successful actor who's most respected credit was a short-lived role on a soap opera years ago. Now his more recent stuff is the voice-over who mumbles the warning for the side effects from non-prescription meds near the end of the commercial. Jack is living an ideal life otherwise and Miles has seen better days. In fact, he's borderline suicidal--taking plenty of meds and alcohol, usually all at once. Jack is about to get married. He wants to go out to local wine country and bring Miles with him, and hopefully out of his funk.Jack is a self-satisfied animal who enjoys giving in to his baser animal instincts. A total tomcat who enjoys being ""on the edge"" and flirting with danger, he sort of enjoys toeing the line. The most outrageous thing about Jack is he often gets off lighter than he should. We all root for Miles and idolize Jack.Maybe a trip out to wine country is just what Miles needs. We all know some big things are about to happen over the course of this one week.One of Miles' true passions that does bring him happiness in wine. The right wine. And with great wine, you have to know what you're talking about. You treat it as an art, as yourself. It's not like any other drug. It becomes a way of life, not only as art, but as a way of who you are.Paul Giamatti is simply an actor who never ceases to amaze me. From his breakthrough role as the anal-retentive watchdog station manager in ""Private Parts"" (he was one of the bigger surprises in that movie. The fact that he was passed over for an Oscar nod for this one (as well as ""American Splendor"" and ""Cinderella Man"") borderlines on criminal. On felony.Thomas Hayden Church, who was pretty much just vaguely remembered for his stock idiot character Lowell, the mechanic on the one of the world's most generic sit-com, ""Wings"" simply rivets here. As Jack, he has the charm of a stud who's about to peak, but doesn't realize or care. A serial philanderer, he is literally willing to cheat on his fiancée without second thought or guilt right before the wedding. We encourage his cheating. Let's see where his libido might lead him. To pleasure, now, yes. But we all know it'll lead him into a hornet's nest eventually. And we're anxious to see how.When the arrive at their destination, two women come into the picture. A waitress, Maya (Virgina Madsen) and a hostess, (Sandra Oh) come into the picture. We know they're the ones who are going to put everything into play.Sandra Oh, writer-director Payne's then-wife, moves us in a big way as one of the wine hostess who falls for Jack and his animal way. They wind up having a fast relationship and one of the most surprising moments comes when we realize where all this is going. We know Jack is sticking his pride and joy into a hornet's nest and we want him to, because we know he'll have a blast and we'll do the same just watching. She isn't just a hottie, she has a wild spirit we'd all want to get into.And Virgina Madsen plays the kind of angel from above here on Earth, walking as a mortal that Miles seems to have been praying for. And when she's on screen, we all feel that Miles may be finally saved. And is there a chance someone like her will rush down at save us when we really need it? The film knows the most effective comedy and drama comes the ordinary plight of the human condition. It's the kind of movie where you keep thinking, ""Yeah, this is life. This is so exactly true to life... right down to every last detail."" The filmmakers have fashioned this into a natural true-to-life way all about the fascination of human nature. The ways of ordinary life--laughter, anger, frustration and brain candy--all translate to a cathartic experience for it's little characters as well as it's audience. Composer Rolfe Kent gives ""Sideways"" a light, loose jazzy score. Sometimes rocking. Payne not only directs beautifully and passionately, but manages to get the right feel in every frame. We even identify with the slapstick scenes.One of those rare and precious years where the Academy actually got it right.--Straight, Dane Youssef",Sideways
271,shattenjager777,A surprisingly warm and witty comedy,7,9 February 2005,"I was rather fearful of this film, since it sounded like it could well be another dumb sex comedy upon which for some reason the critics of the United States had seen fit to heap praise (see ""There's Something about Mary"" and ""American Pie"" for examples--better yet, don't see either, ever), but I am pleased to report that I was pleasantly surprised by a sometimes subtle and thoughtful comedy more about pretension than sex.Much of the film in fact resembles a long episode of ""Frasier,"" with the cultured, wine-loving Miles Raymond tasting wines throughout California's wine country while his comparably uncouth friend Jack alternately attempts to engage in Miles's pretensions and makes fun of them and attempts to turn the trip into one about sex (for which he has an unending number of laughable euphemisms). While there is certainly some sexual humor, it is not the entire or even the main purpose of the film, which is what saves it from falling into that sex comedy mire.There are really only two characters of enough note to warrant mentioning the performances in them, so I'm only going to comment on those. Paul Giamatti's performance as Miles is wonderful, showing great subtlety and restraint when needed but also capable of letting loose when the character loses his composure. Everything about Giamatti says ""pathetic, depressed man"" to the audience to the point that within the first five minutes of the movie we already feel we know him, even not having heard his back story. It's criminal that Giamatti was not even nominated for an Oscar. Thomas Haden Church, meanwhile, performs admirably in a much more bland role. Jack keeps his emotional cards (unless sexual appetite can be considered an emotional card) closer to his vest, so that Church is only given a couple of scenes in which to show much acting skill, which he does quite well. There is an air of protectiveness of Miles, however, which he subtly keeps present throughout the film with innumerable small, hardly noticeable gestures and expressions.The dialog is real and witty and ranges from jokes of pure stupidity to some rather intelligent humor, presenting something for everyone. Perhaps it's not the movie to take your grandmother to see (although mine watched ""Friends,"" which had more sex jokes in any five-minute span than this did in the entire film), but it's high-minded enough that you probably won't blush through the entire film.The direction of the film does not particularly impress, since it is simple and relies mostly on the beauty of the setting (which is a considerable asset) to make the visual statement rather than any particular film trickery. It reminds me a bit of Kenneth Branagh's beautiful ""Much Ado about Nothing,"" though California is not Tuscany and no one would confuse them, in its presentation.All in all, ""Sideways"" is a fabulously well-acted and attractive comedy with such a wide array of jokes that it will likely appeal to everyone somewhere along the line. It should not be missed, even if, like me, you generally avoid hit comedies (When I was listening to the audience laughing, I realized I've never actually been to a theater to see a comedy before--unless you count ""The Forgotten,"" but I think of that as a joke rather than a comedy.) because they all seem stupid. Also be warned that there are a few sections of this movie that are much more dramatic than comedic, though none are particularly long or annoying and it certainly doesn't move into ""How to Kill Your Neighbor's Dog"" territory of switching from comedy to drama midway through, but these moments are part of what give the film its wonderful depth. In a very strong movie year, ""Sideways"" is one of the standouts and a deserved best picture nominee, and as such I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys films.But if you laugh every time someone says ""Pinot,"" anyone who watches the movie with you is going to kill you by the end.",Sideways
272,TheTwistedLiver,Bizarre reflection of Midnight Cowboy,7,1 April 2006,"After hearing much hullabaloo about how great this film was, it was hard to see it with an open mind. As a big fan of the previous Alexander Payne film Election, I was expecting a wry film with some interesting shots and editing. As a whole, this film disappointed me, it took a long time to get going and when it did, the characters depressed me, but not in the way they were supposed to. I have no problem watching two guys in a motel room, watching golf, as long as it is a home video of myself on vacation with a friend. As a matter of fact on second thought, I would rather watch a pot that was going to boil than watch two guys sitting in a motel room watching golf. What stuck out in my mind the most about this film was its obvious parallel to Midnight Cowboy. You have the crippled con man who makes the oddest of friendships with the all American, ruggedly handsome, American man. Paul Giamatti of course being emotionally crippled and Dustin Hoffman physically, but you get my drift? Both blonde men in both films, have no problems with women, while the friends struggle just to survive in the world at all, the blonde men both believe that life is all about sex, and give the friends a hard time for not ""getting any"", and the crippled friends will let you believe that is the furthest thing from their minds. They don't seem believable as friends, yet they both need each other, and after time you see how they fill each others voids. I digress, back to Sideways, and put Midnight Cowboy on hold, the film tried to be too smart, the dialogue about why Paul Giamatti loves pinot was an obvious attempt at clever script writing, if you are watching a film thinking this is trying to be intelligent, rather than getting carried away by it, it is a failure and pretentious. The acting was pretty good however which is the only thing that saves this depressing waste of time about two men going through midlife crises. The only reason this film is worth while is for the acting. Go see Midnight Cowboy, and if you've already seen it, see Sam Peckinpahs Straw Dogs.",Sideways

274,gus120970,An amusing inebriates road trip,7,27 August 2006,"One thing I could not get out of my head watching Sideways is - how drunk must these guys be when driving? Miles and Jack, well I'd expect nothing less. But the lovely Mia and the feisty Stephanie seemed to be tanking it down and getting behind the wheel regularly. As I yearly like to do the drive between LA and SF, and have stopped before at Solvang, I'm going to be a lot more careful in future! I think Sideways benefited, in Oscar year, from the phenomenon of Los Angeleans (on the Oscar judging panel) loving localised reflections of themselves. It's a pretty good movie, but is it that good? As Miles might analyse it, it's lacking in sufficient 'body' whatever general and profound extrapolations on life, failure and relationships one might want to see there. There are frequently amusing vignettes but no great revelations and, mirroring the characters' attitude, a lack of ambition from a film-making perspective. Which is in its way healthy enough, but does it make it worthy of an Oscar? I also began to tire of the overplayed 'life as wine' metaphor, which is pretty much done to death by the midpoint of the movie: okay we get it already! If the ending plays awkwardly it's because it's a little bit too convenient, and also because we've realised, before Mia, that Miles is actually an extremely boring and self-absorbed individual and how long will it be before he's stealing from her purse? But then perhaps its refreshing to see people making the wrong big decisions in movies.",Sideways
275,TooShortforThatGesture,Awful. What are people thinking?,1,21 December 2004,"This is a terrible movie.Some Spoilers below (but if it keeps you from watching this particular movie, I don't think you can really say it's been ""spoiled."") We follow two forty-something losers (Jack, a has-been minor actor and Miles, a divorced wine geek/wannabe writer middle school teacher who drinks too much) through a bachelor trip they take together to the Santa Barbara wine country during the week before the actor's wedding.There are lots of problems with this movie, but most of them lie in the area of credibility. I understand that this is not meant to be precise realism but: It seems impossible that these two guys have ever wanted to spend 5 minutes with each other. They nothing in common and personalities that intersect at no point whatsoever. Furthermore, they are both unbearable. Jack is an ass. Miles is the kind of deliberately unhappy man who makes you want to slit your own throat to escape his moaning. The idea that they've been best buddies since college is ludicrous.The idea that Jack -- a classic ""good-time Joe"" (who's main goal for the trip is to get laid) agreed to a tour of the vineyards of Santa Barbara County as his ""week before marriage"" trip is dumb. (You don't go to wine country to meet someone for sex -- you go to wine country to have sex with someone you already know.) Jack is Mr. Vegas (or Acapulco or even Tijuana), all the way. It's like the idea of George W. Bush going to Sta. Barabara to party. It is admittedly not my area of expertise, but I just don't believe that two forty-something straight guys would EVER plan a week-long wine tasting trip with each other.So to my mind the movie tries to build itself from a central relationship and a central plot device that are equally incredible.As for character development, well... Jack turns out to be little more than a ""horndog former pretty boy"" stereotype. He is allowed to cry at one point while claiming to love his fiancée, but it's sort of a shock and hard to buy given his complete indifference to her at every other point in the movie. Miles, on the other hand, does seem to go from being a tedious depressed sot to a tedious somewhat-less-depressed sot. (Really, he makes you yearn for the cheerfulness of Giamatti's Harvey Pekar character in ""American Splendor"".) But, from everything we see, it seems unlikely that Miles will ever manage to pull a worthwhile existence out of this particular life. He's such a self-involved, emotionally unattractive person that when, at the end of the film, he takes the step of chasing down Virginia Madsen's character (a warm, wise and beautiful woman who is way far out of Miles' league in any universe, fictional or real), not only is it difficult to cheer for him, one wants to yell at the screen to warn her not to answer the door.As for the women -- well they are all there pretty much just to be mistreated, demeaned and/or talked about like meat. As silly as it is, the ""wine country"" trip is, of course, supposed to be a metaphor. Many of the characters are obsessed with wine (to an extent that makes you think that maybe they fall in together because nearly everyone else runs away when they see them coming) and they use the language of wine to discuss other issues in their life. A lot.(Basically: People, like wine, are complex and you should take the time to savor them properly. Also, you have to be sure to act on things in your life at peak moments, just the way you must drink fine wines at their peak. There. I've saved you 2 hours.)The movie is jam-packed with wine stuff -- tastings, discussions, tours of wineries, walks through vineyards. At one point the screen splits into four parts seemingly because the filmmakers shot so much second-unit footage of wine country scenery that they just can't get it all out there without using some distracting pointless student-film device. Now metaphors are great and, eptly used, they can resonate with an audience and deepen the meaning of a creative work. But someone needs to tell Mr. Payne that there is a line beyond which metaphor becomes bad documentary ... and in this case that line is somewhere back in his editing room.This ""wine documentary"" feel adds to the generally uneven tone of the picture -- it can't seem to decide whether it's a realistic drama, a fantasy, a fairy-tale or brutal hyper-reality. So it tries a little of each.Oh - and it's not funny.",Sideways

All of his films have been 'comedies' that put the leading characters through hell and the films also make comment about America and its citizenry. Payne has an excellent eye for the foibles of the inhabitants of this great land. After deconstructing the main character Payne leaves a small glimmer of hope that things could possibly get better, maybe. We are left in the end rooting for the hero or heroine. In Sideways Payne has once again assembled an excellent cast. All of the characters are like seeing old friends they are so familiar. It's hard for me to imagine anyone doing a better job of conveying Miles, the angst-ridden liar, than Paul Giamatti. Just watching him made me wince in recognition of his pain. Thomas Haden Church as the puerile bridegroom Jack, is both hilarious and sad. Sandra Oh's undiscerning Stephanie gets a chance to try to beat some sense into Jack, who really believed he was in love with her for a minute. He certainly had it coming. Does it work? No! Virginia Madsen captures the vulnerability and naiveté of Maya who is at the end, apparently is still willing to get into relationship with the deceptive Miles.

And there's a lot of belly laughs to be had, which I wasn't expecting, although the slapstick jokes are far more well executed than in a teen sex comedy (a character pouring a huge bowl of tasted wine over himself in frustration is my favourite bit).

""Sideways"" is the surprise movie of the year - a slice-of-life, buddy movie that makes you laugh with, as well as at, yourself. There are a few implausibilities in this particular slice-of-life, but much as in Forsythe's ""Local Hero"", they only help to enhance the quality of the movie by melding seamlessly with the whole.It's an intensely personal movie. Without wasting much time, characters Miles and Jack are introduced to you and you like them, even though Miles has ripped off his mom. There's also a sense of Odd Couple deja vu in the way that they relate - you see the love that they have for each other almost immediately.

You accept them and follow them as they spend a week in Northern California.The performances are vivid.

282,Rick-34,"brilliant, touching comedy",9,4 December 2004,"Wow.Paul Giamatti has been breaking through in the past few years, most notably with his performance in American Splendor last year. In Sideways, he finds a vehicle that fits his talents to a T. Giamatti is adorable as the lovable shlub Miles Raymond, who is taking his buddy Jack (Thomas Hayden Church) on a weeklong vacation of wine-tasting and golf in Santa Barbara County before Jack's marriage the following weekend. After the two of them head out, Jack reveals that he feels that his marriage will mean the end of his freedom, and that he wants to have one more fling before the marriage. Also, because he loves Miles so much, and Miles suffers from such chronic depression, he, Jack, will do Miles a great favor and help him get laid.The movie starts with a reasonable pace, as Jack and Miles eat at a pleasant restaurant where everybody knows Miles, who has made many previous tours of wine country, and is quite a wine connoisseur. They meet up with Maya (Virginia Madsen), a waitress who can keep up with Miles in discussions of wine. But when Maya shows some interest in an evening activity, Miles chickens out, claiming fatigue. The next day, during their wine touring, they meet another charming woman, Stephanie (Sandra Oh). It turns out she knows Maya, and Jack sets up a double date. And thus begins the meat of the movie.Sideways is a nice movie in that it accurately captures the contrast between Jack the actor, who is not Miles' intellectual equal, and behaves remarkably immaturely, but never lets anything slow him down, and Miles, who seems eternally mired in moping about his recent divorce, his failing novel, and the general inequities of life. One is the conscience, the other is the source of energy, and as a partnership it works well, to some extent. Again, Giamatti is absolutely brilliant in this role. Virginia Madsen is terrific as Maya - she is perfect for Miles and even Jack can see this (if Miles is a bit too insecure to hope for that much). There are a lot of comic moments, some contrived, some natural, and on the whole, the movie is very refreshing. See it!",Sideways

But to me she's Madeline in the prophetic Electric Dreams, breaking three hearts at the same time, Miles Harding, his computer and mine. Now here she is in the fantastic Sideways one nomination away from a statue. I think she's basically finally won hearts via a single speech she gives at the heart of the film in which her character Maya explains why she loves wine. I won't give away the details, but by the end you'll love wine and love her too.But that's one of the great things about Sideways -- the chance to see actors I've whose work I loved for years, which no one else has heard of in something which everyone is talking about. I was afraid Paul Giamatti was going to end up being 'the guy from American Splendor' for the rest of his career but here people are putting a name to a face they've been seeing for years. Look at his filmography there are very few films you haven't heard of. In fact in some he's even played proto-Miles, especially Bruce Paltrow's Duets in which karaoke was his love instead. Sandra Oh might look like a discovery but she's equally always been busy (Bean: The Ultimate Disaster Film to Under the Tuscan Sun). I remember her from Last Night and The Red Violin in which she had a quiet dignity far removed from Stephanie. If I'm being honest though I've never watched the sitcom Wings so I don't know about the cult of Thomas Haden Church. But is in George of the Jungle which is good enough for me.In casting these actors, Alexander Payne knew exactly what he was doing. Apparently George Clooney was actively campaigning for Giamatti's part. Extrapolating that further, we could have ended up with Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts and introducing some young actress. All perfectly fine actors and they would have essayed their roles well, and the chemistry would have been there, but it would have felt false -- this didn't need a successful cast -- a dream cast. It needed a group of actors who all seemed kind of familiar without being 'famous' because these are characters who are just like us or people we know. Very refreshing.",Sideways

Hmmmmm. so it must be something. I went back to my friend and borrowed the DVD and I watched it. Oh my god I wish I watched it earlier.It really is the best comedy of the millennium. You can laugh you can cry you can get stunned; it is full of joy full of sadness full of life story.Alexander Payne, the great leader of the new generation of film directors, with Rob Marshall and Sam Mendes. He can get you to know the smallest detail of every member of the cast. The chemistry between him and Paul Giamatti was fantastic.The extraordinariness of the screenplay is speaking of itself, a faaaantaaaaastic adaptation of wonderful story, well deserved Oscar winner, ""this is the best adaptation since Howard's End "".Paul Giamatti should have got an Oscar nomination for his role as the confused Miles, he was at his best, he was superb in the scene when he was calling his ex-wife at the restaurant, he was just amazing.Thomas Haden Church is a first class comedian, he can make you laugh with just a blink of his eye, he was hilarious, and once again a well deserved nomination.Virginia Madsen, is as natural as nature it self, in that scene when she was describing the life cycle of a bottle of wine I thought she was a real life wine expert, her emotions were knocking on the screen.Even Sandra Oh was at her best shape ever.The film is full of unforgettable scenes, alongside that is an amazing score that fit perfectly with every single scene.The ending was so happy which I liked, every thing goes where it should, jack got married and miles went to Maya, a happy ending means a good impression on people.This is once in a decade comedy that is not to be missed, thank you Alexander Payne for this masterpiece.",Sideways

As a longtime fan of both Thomas Haden Church and Virginia Madsen, I was thrilled to see their careers jump-started from this film. The woefully underrated yet brilliant Paul Giamatti and wonderful Sandra Oh were the icing on the casting cake. Even if this movie were not the darling of most critics, it would still make my all time top 10 list. What's not to love about this film? It is the final product of a beautifully written, directed, and acted script with four of the most human characters ever portrayed on screen. It made me laugh until I cried, truly. The scenery was unbelievable-after seeing it, I wanted to run out and hop a plane to California to visit the wine country. I am so thankful that someone took a chance on a project that rises so far above the typical formulaic Hollywood fare that the industry has been churning out in droves. They hit one out of the park with this one!",Sideways

Sure, it's already in the IMDb top 250, but does that necessarily mean anything? It looked like a movie about wine tasting. WINE TASTING. And yet, they made it work.Miles (Giamatti) and Jack (Church) go on a little road trip one week before Jack's wedding. Since Miles is the best man, the idea is for him to take Jack around and show him a good time. So they plan is to go all through wine country, taste a bunch of different wines, play golf, relax. Stuff like that.But Jack has other plans. He decides that since Miles has been officially depressed for like, two years, he will have a mission on this road trip. To get Miles laid. Truly, what a noble friend. And Jack has plans for himself as well. To enjoy his last week of freedom, and to also get laid. Oddly enough, Miles objects to Jack's carefree plan. Has this thing about ""loyalty to your fiancé."" Party pooper.The movie is about friendship, about finding yourself, about finding what really matters in life. It has a very crude way of getting to the point, and at many points throughout the movie I wondered just why I was watching it, but I don't think I regret it. Overall, I think it was a pretty good flick.It's just probably not one for the uptight folks out there who like their movies to be perfectly spotless and controversy free.Bottom Line: 3.5 out of 4 (probably worth a viewing)",Sideways

He is an eminently American director that can look in with the incisive eye of an incisive foreigner. Besides all that, he is a poet. In ""Election"" he gives us an electro shock disguised as a Teen College Comedy. I laughed in horror at the cleverness of the storytelling. In ""About Schmid"" he forces us to look into one of the darkest corners of our society and find ourselves there. And he does it in the funniest most entertaining way. In ""Sideways"" he trusts his audience enough to put impossible hurdles for us to love his characters -- Paul Giamatti and his mother's money, for instance -- and yet, we have to admit he's made his point. We are all people. He manages to surprise us with our own capacity for compassion. Vittorio De Sica, Billy Wilder and Mario Monicelli come to mind. Yes Mr. Payne you are the ticket!",Sideways
288,jwhale9382,What a great movie!,8,22 April 2005,"I had to see this movie for a school project. I didn't expect to like it, or understand it for that matter (This is actually the first Alexander Payne movie I've ever seen). But after seeing it and thinking about it for a few minutes after-wards, I understood it completely, and I liked it, too.The movie is about two middle-aged friends, Miles (Paul Giamatti) and Jack (Thomas Haden Church). Miles is an out-of-work writer whose life has been in a rut for years. He's divorced and his life is completely unorganized. Jack is about to get married, but wants to know if women still think he's a stud. The two take a small trip up to California wine country to have some ""guy time"" before Jack's wedding. While they're up there, the meet two women (Virginia Madsen and Sandra Oh) who help the guys find the parts of themselves they've been missing.This was a hilarious movie. Although there was a lot of crude and sexual humor, many of the jokes were funny (although you probably don't want to let your kids hear them). It also kept the movie from getting boring. But when they showed the running naked guy, I had to look away. That was just weird.There was also a heavy emphasis on wine in the film, but it served several purposes. Wine-tasting was Miles' hobby, it served as a way for Miles and Jack to meet the ladies (they worked in a winery), and even served as a metaphor for Miles' life.This is definitely ""not"" a family movie. Older audiences will love this humorous story about two middle-aged men trying to find themselves.This may not be the best review I have ever written, but I've always wanted to write a review for an Oscar-winning movie.",Sideways
289,mattbaxter72,I must be the only one...,4,26 September 2006,"OK, let me start by saying that I am the kind of person who's supposed to like this movie. I'm white, 35 years old, male, and the kind of solidly middle-class guy who should like wine. So why am I just about the only person in the world over the age of eighteen who hates it? It isn't that nothing happens. Admittedly you have a movie that is about two guys driving around, drinking wine and trying to get laid, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Nothing much happens in a lot of great movies - Ghost World, for example, or Lost In Translation. The acting is just as good as everyone says it is, and some of the dialogue is downright great - I loved Miles describing the bouquet of a wine as 'like a nutty kind of Edam', among many other even more unlikely things.So why did I hate it? Purely because of the characters. When the most sympathetic male character in the movie is a guy who's cheating on his fiancée in the week leading up to their wedding, you know you're going to find it hard to like anyone. But Jack, the cheater, is approximately 17,000 times more likable than his buddy Miles. Miles is a crashing snob about wine, and also a crashing bore. He is whiny, mopey, and so wrapped up in himself that he can't even recognise when a beautiful woman wants him. He's written a novel that can't get published, more than likely because anyone who reads it is going to slash their wrists before they get to halfway. Oh, and he steals money from his mother. This is the guy that we're supposed to sympathise with. It's deeply worrying that most critics apparently did just that. What does that say about these guys' lives? And what is going on with Virginia Madsen's character, Maya? Here we have yet another Hollywood Waitress - you know, one of those who's waiting tables into her thirties, yet is beautiful, intelligent, in touch with her emotions, you name it. And of course she falls for the writer's alter-ego, Miles. Yep, this smart, pretty woman falls head over heels for a dismal loser who looks like Paul Giamatti - sorry, Paul, but you know it's true... This is because she appreciates the True Genius Of The Writer, before she's even read his unpublishable novel (she loves it, but you probably already guessed that). Was there a little bit of wish-fulfilment going on here, Mr Payne? Just asking...Oh well, it's not like anyone is going to read this thing anyway (just like Miles' novel, ha ha) and obviously a lot of people do like this movie, so I guess it's a case of 'everyone else is out of step except me'.One last thing... Virginia Madsen, if you're reading this - I'm a middle-aged, grumpy, boring unpublished author, and I'm quite ugly too. So if you really do go for guys like that, why not get in touch? What, me, bitter? Nooooooooooo.........",Sideways
290,Elgroovio,Depressing and truly watchable,10,4 March 2005,"""I feel so insignificant I can't even kill myself"" says the depressed Miles, played to perfection by Paul Giamatti. This excellent film has every ingredient which the (in my opinion) highly overrated ""Lost In Translation"" lacked. Like in the equally great film by the same director Alexander Payne, ""About Schmidt"", we feel the relentless pain that the principle character is subjected to. In ""Sideways"", we feel Miles' miserable feeling of general uselessness as he attempts in vain to get a book published. Yet this film is very funny in all of its insane depression, which is what makes it so watchable and enjoyable. An excellent cast makes the film even more fantastic, with Thomas Haden Church perfect in the roll of the playboy Jack, Virginia Madsen very suitable in the roll of the wine fanatic beloved of Miles, and also Sandra Oh is good as Jack's girlfriend. Credit has to be given too to Marylouise Burke who is great in the role of Miles' ecstatic mother. Moving, funny and to a certain extent pretty true, ""Sideways"" is a rare example of truly excellent film-making. Not to be missed.",Sideways
291,Jay09101951,One phenomenal movie,10,10 December 2005,"A friend of mine who is a movie buff like me, high recommended this film to me. When I got the DVD and watched it, I was moved by some scenes unlike most films I had ever saw. I still can't believe Paul Giamatti was not even nominated for an Oscar for best actor. The scene where he describes the grapes that have thin skin and need a lot of TLC is most most moving, for it's obvious he is describing his own life and the fact is ex-wife did not care for him or maybe nurture him the way he would like. And when his wild friend Jack comes to his senses after leaving his wallet and wedding rings in some married woman's bedroom, we at once see a man who never grew up all of a sudden discover the wisdom that comes when you know you must treasure the person who is your soul mate for life, In Jack's case his bride-to-be. Another scene I found very moving is when after the wedding, Miles meets his ex-wife's new husband and she informs him she is pregnant. The viewer can at once feel the punch she just gave Miles in the stomach . I think a lot of us know a Miles or maybe are one ourselves. That is the essence of the film, as the 2 main characters are so real. Many people lose their soul mate in middle age, either thru divorce or death and many men and women are left shattered and feel their lives have been a big waste. Miles shows that when the time is right, you can get back on the horse that you fell off of 2 or 3 or how many years ago. It's not a switch you can turn on. Like Miles shows, you have to heal up and you just know when the time is right to start over again.",Sideways
292,morrowmmm,Rather mundane and boring,4,28 October 2004,"This film has gathered a raft of plaudits from all the critics. I and a friend went to see it because of that. we were both disappointed. This is a breath of fresh air for all the experts who are hailing it with sensitive, subtle, a buddy movie etc. Possibly for the rest of us mortals it showed the mundane activities of two losers. Outside of the rest of the world they would be wondering what these two unattractive characters had to be desperate about. One day in the real world, in the middle East or other third world countries might make this couple realize what real desperation was. So apparently I have joined the world of Klutzes who have not the intelligence to understand. Mind you, with these two it is hard to stay awake long enough to make the attempt.",Sideways
293,RandomTask-AP,Spin the Bottle,9,6 February 2005,"Some great stories have been told over glasses of wine late in the evening. The best ones hearken back to one crazy guy or another who you knew way back when. Then someone pulls out a home video of some of their unfortunate antics. Everyone is simultaneously laughing in spite of themselves and horrified at what was probably rolling around in the old friend's head when he pulled the stunt. If you had been able to pick two particularly unhinged friends and quietly leave a camera running on them for a road trip and its fallout, you would have the elements that make ""Sideways"" so cringe-worthy, moving and hilariously watchable.Miles Raymond (Paul Giamatti) is taking his engaged actor friend, Jack (Thomas Hayden Church) on a road trip as a bachelor party that will get Jack back the Friday before his wedding. Miles and Jack are long-time friends who put up with one another's quirks because of mutual tolerance. It's co-dependency at its most heterosexual. Driving north to wine country is the plan, but it's clear that wine is Miles' passion and Jack doesn't care a lick about his meticulous deconstruction of color, flavor, bouquet and legs. Jack's poison of choice is women. The guys get to Miles' favorite area for wine, and he introduces Jack to various staff members he is familiar with. Jack sets his mind to getting Miles shacked up with Maya (Virginia Madsen), who Miles has been reluctant to approach in spite of his many trips to the restaurant where she works. To make more of an impression, Jack lies and tells Maya that Miles just got his book published. Miles doesn't deny it but is less than thrilled. A day later, a chance encounter with Maya's friend, a sexy wine sommelier named Stephanie (Sandra Oh), lines up dinner for the four of them. The wine and food flows, and in spite of Miles sneaking off in a drunken buzz to call his ex-wife in the middle of the meal, the couples pair off well enough. Stephanie invites everyone back to her house in lieu of dessert. While Miles and Maya get deep into awkward verbal foreplay, Jack and Stephanie consummate their flickering attractions. This sets everyone in motion for the rest of the week. It's not that you can't see all the trouble coming, but the particular shape that it forms is unique and compelling.The structure of ""Sideways"" is seamless. There are dozens of situations in the film that have the potential to drop into sitcom clichés, but the script and director never let it go there. Miscommunication is the chief mechanism for the plot, but a sitcom would put them together in a way that would show everyone trying to be honest. Jack and Miles take actions or inactions are deliberately deceptive and frequently reprehensible. These are moves of desperation, and the consequences are not easily swept under the rug with an apology and a puppy dog look. This is not a film to challenge notions of visuals like ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind"", but Phedon Papamichael's cinematography has breathtaking moments. One of the best examples is when the vastness of a winery's warehouse becomes quietly intimate and rich with wood tones and filtered sunlight.Character dramas leave the lion's share of the burden to the actors, and the performances are brilliant. Sandra Oh's tough and worldly Stephanie has her vulnerabilities, and illustrates that having those weaknesses revealed is more painful than the weaknesses themselves. Jack is a great creation: a college-years Peter Pan who doesn't have the slightest interest in acknowledging his own adulthood. Nevertheless, Thomas Hayden Church explodes the thespian jock into a tangible person who is sympathetic as he tries to get Miles to open up and who can be genuinely charming. The character of Maya is the real middle-aged rebel woman so many would like to be, and someone who has discovered the way to challenge her world without following Diane Lane's melodramatic trail to Tuscany. Virginia Madsen shows Maya as a woman of strength and intelligence who refuses to let her bad experiences crush her curiosity and hope without making her naive. Finally, there is Paul Giamatti's Miles. This is a character of comically tragic proportions that Giamatti makes us respect because he respects the character. The despicable things he does are done in self-awareness and self-loathing, but the times when he reaches out of his own self-pity to pull himself up, it makes you want to cheer him on. It is a wonderfully complex and painful performance that is all the more tragic because it has been unjustly overlooked for a Best Actor Oscar by the Academy.This is not an easy movie to watch, but it is definitely one of 2004's highs in American cinema. The humor is born from the situations its characters create, and everything flows naturally. The heart of the comedy is two lost souls trying to comfort and aid each other, and they are frightfully short on the necessary skills. At any given moment, anything can happen, and it does. There are many lessons taught unknowingly by the characters to the audience without one note of condescension from the director. ""Sideways"" is dead-on accurate even if the road is not so straight and narrow.9 out of 10",Sideways
294,surfandski,"First rate characters, first rate casting, first rate acting",9,22 April 2005,"It is a joy not to be disappointed by a movie that you have been waiting to watch, and Sideways delivers. Kudos to the casting director that somehow saw that these were the right actors to play these roles. On first look you would not think so. Giamatti's performance is very good, as usual, but he has to be careful not to keep playing these roles of the guy with the anger management problem. Still he shades his character beyond that, and there are some gut wrenching scenes in this movie (i.e. Giamatti opening his mother's drawer) where the feelings experienced by his character comes through the screen in spades. But it is Thomas Heiden Church in my opinion who shines here, he delivers one of the great comedic performances of the last 10 years. His tiger growl after Sandra Oh invites the two buddies to her home is hysterical. Sandra Oh, one very underrated actress, is again perfect in her role. And finally Virginia Madsen, what a joy to see her given a character that is worthy of her talents, her monologue on why she likes wines is delivered with a Deneuve sensuality that freezes you on your couch. 9/10",Sideways

296,hokiemo,Highly Recommended Wine Trip,10,21 April 2005,"Sideways is one of those great original movies that rarely comes along in a movie world full of sequels, remakes, and recycled plot lines. The casting for this movie is excellent and each actor brings something extra special and memorable to his or her role. Paul Giamatti as Miles and Thomas Haden Church as Jack are paired perfectly. We all have those unusual friends who may seem quite different from us, but appeal to some part of our personality. In this movie, Jack is Miles' optimistic party friend. Jack and Miles go on a week long bachelor party in California wine country. Jack is due to get married the following Saturday and Miles is still recovering from his divorce. Jack and Miles are quite different in the relationship department -- Jack has a womanizing problem while Miles has a problem getting too close to anyone. The sometimes dark comedy is expertly played out by using California wine country as a back drop and a metaphor. Jack and Miles sometimes lose control of their emotions and its only exacerbated by the wine they drink in large quantities throughout the movie. Miles' love interest, Maya, sobers Miles up with her beauty and down to earth personality. Similar to enjoying different wine brands, Miles realizes he can appreciate and love another woman after his divorce. Slowly and patiently, Maya and Miles learn how much they have in common and enjoy being together. Jack, on the other hand, aggressively pursues women for temporary gratification. It's hard to imagine he's getting married in a few days and pushing himself to settle down. It takes Jack almost losing the wedding rings to sober him up and make him realize there's much more to a relationship than good s*ex.The best comedic scenes in a long time is when Miles goes back into the house of a woman Jack slept with in order to get Jack's wallet back. After Miles grabs the wallet, the camera shows the woman's nude husband chasing Miles down the driveway. We were rolling with laughter at the sight of all this. One of Sideways' greatest strengths is it's ability to find the humor in everyday situations.One last comment is that Paul Giamatti should have been nominated for an Oscar for his role as Miles. I think his acting talents are underrated.I strongly recommend this film.",Sideways
297,adamk-2,stunningly bad,1,9 February 2005,"This jaw-droppingly overrated film had me squirming in my seat, bored to the point of physical pain, right from the onset of the smoooooth jazz soundtrack and split-screen montage. Next comes the dislikeable, obnoxious, stupid and thoroughly boring characters, sets them up in a totally unlikely relationship and a clichéd situation and then....just goes on and on. It was like being stuck in a lift with a bunch of stamp collectors. Nothing rang true, nothing convinced, right down to the (admittedly excellent) Virginia Madsen character, a geek's fantasy if there ever was one (like comic book obsessives who dream of discussing the merits of the Green Lantern with Scarlett Johanssen).And, to illustrate a point, here's my spoiler: Note that slutty waitress Cammi lives in a run-down, garbage-strewn house and has ""nasty"" sex (with Bush and Rumsfeld on a TV screen -- oh, the political savagery!). Our nice waitresses, however, live in lovely clapboard houses with tasteful, cosy furnishings, artful lighting and intimate music. Our two male heroes, meanwhile, remain selfish, self-absorbed cretins throughout, a road trip without a destination.Meanwhile, is it just me, or should this film have starred David Schwimmer and Matt LeBlanc?

298,chanvat,A looking glass of life,9,30 May 2007,"I have never seen a film of recent ilk this character driven.This film is touted as a comedy, but it really is a drama that is true to life, too true at times. If anything, the comedy comes mostly as a 3rd person observer of an embarrassing situation where you just have to laugh because it isn't you that got involved in it.Many of us wish to achieve fame, so much that we overlook the important aspect of having just one person out there who appreciates us for who we really are. That character in this film is Miles, who blindly strives for fame, knowing he really isn't good enough to make it, but tries anyways. In his attempts he tries so hard he overlooks what is right in front of him, possibly in a rash act of avoidance of opening himself up to a new love.Jack has had his fame, and seems to be riding the coattails of it for all its worth, yet his self worth currently is centered around his fiancé, though he would never admit it.Miles and Jack are diametrically opposed as pessimist and optimist, maturity and immaturity, each is their own balance, and each is their own downfall. Almost like yin and yang personified.The female characters in the film are extensions of Miles and Jack, perfect personality matches, and almost embellishments of their own selves. The circular nature of their relationships provide a sterling aspect to the film as well in a true testament to balance of character.",Sideways
299,stephenpaultaylor,above mediocre,7,27 February 2005,"This was a pleasantly diverting film that doesn't seem worth all of the accolades it has received. It's well-done, entertaining, has some heartwarming observations about life, but it lies far from being amazing. I expected more, to be honest, given all the hooplah. However, it felt a bit worn, as though I'd seen many of the elements in various other buddy movies, road trip movies, and middle-aged crisis movies.People complain that it wasn't funny enough. I don't think it was supposed to be. It had some nice moments; some memorable moments, and I immensely enjoyed watching Drew Hayden Church. Paul Giametti played the sort of shmuck we've seen him play for his whole career, but he was excellent nonetheless.I did have problems with the lies and deceptions in the movie. Sure Drew's character was reprehensible and morally bankrupt in some ways, but neither character is the voice of reason when it comes to the lies and deceipt they both engage in (faking a car accident so Drew's wife doesn't find out about his cheating and lies).I was never bored with the movie; there was always something to keep me hooked, and the depth to which Paul G's character goes into the wine is quite funny, having worked at St*rf*cks (ecch) and having had to learn the subtle differences between the various coffees.Some nice moments, some funny moments, some semi-enlightening moments, but it was far from being a masterpiece.

A broken-down middle-aged man who used to be a writer and dreams of becoming a writer again, a heartbroken man who has been divorced for two years but can't forget his lover.All day long will be their own blockade in the past, in addition to the use of alcohol to drive out the hearts of the depressed, he can do?Training vocabulary skills with crossword puzzles: wrestling with yourself.The director miserably uses two scenes that add up to less than a second to depict this ""alcoholic"" who is immersed in his inner world all day long.
A car, two people, a few boxes of wine, so began a week of pre-marital travel. Drive slowly north along a road lined with vineyards.Will the Chinese people who have only three golden weeks have such a mood?Who can say that natural and unrestrained advertising language: Life is like a journey, do not care about the destination, care only about the scenery along the way.
There is no obvious climax, and the whole film is like a soundtrack, with only a little bit of humor in it.This is a story about ""compromise"". ""Compromise"" is not a bad word, especially in life.What's wrong with making your life easier, throwing off the gloom and starting a new life?",Sideways
304,paloma54,Still waiting for the laughs,2,10 March 2006,"My husband and I waited months to borrow this DVD from the library, and sat down intending to see what is described on the cover as a fabulous comedy. 45 minutes into this unlikely story, we were still waiting for the comedy, and wondering if we were in some alternate universe.The two main male characters Miles and Jack are both pathetic characters with absolutely zilch in common apart from a bit of male anatomy, apparently, so it seemed to us absolutely preposterous that they would be taking a vacation together for a week at this point in their lives. (So what if they were roomies in college. In the movie, they look like men 38 and up) The implausibility of this basic plot premise made it virtually impossible for us to get drawn in to the story.I couldn't buy Stephanie's character at all--she seemed extremely casual about her relationship with Jack, then explodes when she learns of his engagement. Either she's a serious person or not, and if she is, it's highly unlikely she would be so taken in by someone like the utterly transparent and shallow Jack.In short, this movie shows a handful of pathetic and unbelievable characters making one ridiculous, pathetic decision after another. The whole experience is redeemed by the final five minutes, which I won't reveal.Virginia Madsen, who acts the part of Maya, gives us a couple of brief but lovely scenes. Overall, we considered this film a big waste of time, although the fault is not in the acting but in the story itself, and the script.",Sideways
305,tjackson,"Masterpiece of Americana - comic, heartbreaking, inspirational",10,22 October 2004,"All Alexander Payne's films - Citizen Ruth, Election, and About Schmidt  feature characters inhabiting small worlds of minor consequence. The sober fact is that most of us do lead this sort of life and, if not led in quiet desperation, it can be said that most lives are not the purview of movers, shakers, and movie stars. And that's OK. In Payne's films life in America is at once frustrating, comical, heartbreaking, and inspirational. His characters struggle to discover themselves and what in life they really value. He draws the audience into a crucial moment in the character's life and, through brilliant dialogue and impeccable detail, brings the audience into the fray. In his latest film, Sideways, we have the world of Miles Raymond, played with iconic perfection by the Paul Giamatti (Storytelling, American Splendor). Miles is in a serious midlife moment. He is reeling from a recent divorce and, although he thankfully had no children, even this will end up a sore point to his battered ego. Miles is setting out on a trip across Santa Ynez and Solvang areas of California's Wine Country with his friend Jack, a waning star of little known TV shows, a guy with great hair, a rugged tan, but a serious obsession with getting laid. Miles wants to celebrate Jack's last days of bachelorhood with a wine tasting journey across the valley. Miles is a passionate and obsessive expert about all things to do with wine. He wants to teach Jack the joys of wine connoisseurship. Jack wants to score. In fact, Jack wants them both to score. He is equally obsessed with the idea that they both seriously need to score. And therein lies the big problem. Miles is an unfortunate example for how not to meet women. But Payne makes no stern judgment about Miles ineptitude and desperate need for love, nor does he condemn Jack's moral lapses in what is really just another dopey male groping for love and ego satisfaction. Both these guys are seriously flawed. But the film takes them seriously and lets the comedy play itself. The film has a knack for never veering into the obvious payoff or the unneeded explanation for a bit of behavior. We are allowed, as an audience, to judge these pained and straining middle aged guys as fully dimensional people. The real gift of the screen writing (Payne with his collaborator Jim Taylor) is that when it does stumble into sublime comic moments, it never stays there long enough that you feel manipulated by the comedy. It ambles along, the characters converse, situations unfold with patience. The dialogue concerning wine appreciation and the bloom of middle age men are priceless and the analogies marvelous. Don't these guys realize the parallels between the bloom and the aging of a fine wine and their own lives? That wonderful cluelessness and irony gives the audience the distance to remain amused and at the same time, empathize with their earnestness.Thomas Haden Church is brilliant as Jack, instilling Jack's desperate restlessness with a layer of dense sincerity. It is every bit the equal of Giamatti's confounded chump. The two women they meet and woo along the way, Stephanie and Maya (Sandra Oh and Virginia Madsen) are actually the stronger and more self aware characters. The women are honest and forthright. They know their limits and understand their own sexuality. They can be pushed so far. They know the game and are fully capable of deciding whether or not they will choose to play it. It is a sublime contrast to the desperate middle aged man. Finally, there are several other terrific elements to Sideways. The music by Rolfe Kent (who also did About Schmidt) is subtle, but captures the film's mood perfectly. There are some early uses of split screen which, in addition to the look of the cinematography (by Phedon Papamichael) conjure up the look and feel of the old 70's road pictures. The set design and locations speak volumes about these characters and about America itself. From the details of chaotic apartments, to the ambiance of fast food restaurants, and the tastings at the wineries, Sideways like Election and Schmidt catches in its details the flavor of America  tart, assertive, but beautifully balanced: fruit, acid, and flavors all in the right proportion.",Sideways
306,afhick,Amateur Night,3,27 February 2005,"Let me be clear: the rest of the audience was laughing. So it's probably just me, but I couldn't begin to get into this film about losers. The actor who played Miles (I'm tempted to call him Chris Elliot) was enough to permanently sour me on wine, in general, and oenophiles, in particular. His take on the grape is best spelled with an ""h."" He lost me from the moment he stole money from his mother's drawer (he's a middle-aged English teacher, for Cripe's sake!); that shot of him drinking wine from a Styrofoam cup summed up his whole character for me. Who could believe that the lovely Virginia Madsen would ever give him a second look? Thomas Haden Church was at least a lovable loser, played somewhere between Lowell and Ned. But Sandra Oh took the acting honors. The film was crudely edited; there were some extremely awkward cuts that made it obvious a certain amount of time had elapsed. The extreme close-ups were more than annoying-- especially when Virginia Madsen and Thomas Haden Church are practically indistinguishable from their pores. And what was the point of that split screen? And nobody's going to convince me that Miles and Jack were ever friends in college. Or that they'd still be friends twenty years later. Mismatches often work in film (think Murphy and Nolte, or De Niro and Grodin), but this one is voluntary. We are led to believe that Jack was once a successful soap opera star--was Miles meeting him after classes on the set? I could go on, but I've probably already earned enough death threats. This morning, I learned from CBS that people are actually making pilgrimages to the film's locations to relive the ""magic."" Fans in the broadcast could quote entire passages from the film. So be it. ""Sideways"" will probably sweep the Academy Awards tonight. I may be the only moviegoer in America who doesn't care.",Sideways
307,RovingGambler,Payne's finest film yet,10,15 July 2006,"Alexander Payne hasn't made a bad movie yet, and this is his best yet. I see this really as a character study of two middle-aged guys, one (Jack) being the guy who is getting married in a few days and wants to live it up for his last few days of bachelorhood, and the other (Miles) being a depressed writer/English teacher/wine connoisseur. While both of these characters are despicable in many ways, I still think most people will find at least pieces of them that ring true with themselves. I personally identified more with Miles, and his struggles at trying to succeed and be somebody. His little speech about why he likes pinot so much is one of the greatest scenes I've ever seen. It's amazing, and sad, how he can be so descriptive and passionate about wine, yet be so inept at human relationships, specifically with Maya. How Paul Giamatti didn't even get nominated for his acting is something I may never understand.Oh yeah, I almost forgot to mention this movie is very funny as well. But at the same time, I wouldn't go into it expecting it to be laugh-out-loud funny. It's humor is subtle, and I could see why there are people who don't see the humor. But if you do see the humor, then you're in for a real treat. So this movie is an intimate character study as well as being very funny at times. This is easily among my absolute favorite movies, and the best movie of 2004.",Sideways

How glad I was that I did as it turned out to be one of my most enjoyable cinematic experiences of 2005. I won't bother to describe the story here in any detail as others have already done so. What made the film such an enjoyable experience was the sheer quality - the acting, direction, script and photography, all of the highest order but particularly the warmth that the film radiates. This is a film about ordinary people leading mostly pretty ordinary lives - very similar to much French cinema in this respect - and through sheer skill manages to make this absolutely absorbing. No space monsters, killing, computer generated special effects! This was for me the type of 'small' (modest budget, cast not particularly well known) film that occasionally comes out of the US and stands comparison with the best anywhere. A must for mature film lovers of all ages. I really liked it!",Sideways

I would have thought you would have to live longer to truly appreciate this movie. The movie rang very true to me and I enjoyed every minute of it. There are a number of excellent movies playing now. To me this ranks right up there with Ray, Kinsey, and Finding Neverland. All have Oscar worthy performances. It will be interesting to see who gets nominated. The four main actors in Sideways are all worthy of consideration.",Sideways
311,jessfink,"Oh, stop THINKING so much",9,28 November 2004,"I just read a review from someone on here that spent two pages lambasting this movie for being MISOGYNIST! LOL. Rather than laud the film, which I think at this point is unnecessary, I would prefer to respond to this completely overinvested and misguided person's claims that the film marginalizes and hates women.The reason this film doesn't deal with the female characters except as how they affect the male characters is that the MOVIE isn't ABOUT the female characters. This movie is about one person. Miles. Jack, Stephanie and Maya all exist to illustrate various aspects of Miles and his inability to deal with the parts of his personality that they challenge or elucidate. The reason Stephanie is peripheral is that she is PERIPHERAL. That doesn't make her marginalized...that doesn't make the movie misogynist, and that doesn't make this movie insidiously anti-woman. Maya takes an indeterminate amount of time to even call Miles back at the end, so your point that she should never have contact with him again to show solidarity with Stephanie is nebulous, at best. It could have been months since he sent her that letter, and the fact of the matter is, he knocks on her door, but you have no idea what happens afterwards. She could open it, and throw something at him. Secondly, why should Maya never see Miles again? HE told her the truth, albeit after a long time. HE wasn't Jack, to quote him in the film. She called him on it, dumped him, and he paid the price. Why should Maya risk never finding happiness to suit her friend? This isn't high school--this is real life, and people do things that are stupid, bad, selfish or ill-advised all the time. Once Maya had a chance to get over her anger and perhaps understand his human failings, maybe she actually possesses the ability to show compassion and forgive. You act like she's been lobotomized.Your point, gwmandpc or whatever your name was, that JACK is supposed to be the protagonist, or the one we all identify with, is completely off base. Jack's behavior is long standing. We see him interact with Stephanie to simply get an idea of what he has been doing to women all this time. Identify with him? How about pitying and having contempt for him? I didn't see one person in the theater rooting him on...everyone was saddened by his inability to cope with his failure as an actor, and everyone I was with--close to 15 people--seemed to understand that the way he was with women had nothing to do with the women, and everything to do with him. I could go on and on, but frankly, I think you have to have too much time on your hands to peg this as anything other than a character study of ONE person. Women are secondary in this movie. That's it. It's not a commie plot.",Sideways
312,ociopia,Excellent expose of narcissism on two sides of the same coin,8,2 February 2005,"A woman's take on this is probably not the same as a man's. Initially I was put off by Charles Hayden's Church's character crudeness and Giamatti's character's repulsiveness but that changed was I was able to look below the surface. By the end of the movie, I felt very sorry for Church as he was not only dumb and shallow, he was actually so empty that whatever female was before him became a mirror of his need to connect with anything that felt like caring. Church did a fabulous job and was incredibly believable as a has-been wannabe, desperate to hold on to his dream of the kind of good life that is bought by charm and good looks. He is just on the edge or realizing his time is running out and that is a whole lot for this character to absorb as he has never given much to the concept of ""thought.""Giammeti is a pitiful, self-absorbed, destructive, depressed alcoholic whose in possession of two ""things."" He knows a great deal about wine and he has written a book. Nothing else informs him. Yet his performance is so nuanced that we are able to fill in his depth of character and decency primarily through his huge, limpid eyes. What a performance. He should have been nominated for an academy award. This is a role that comes along once-in-a-lifetime for this type of character actor, like Liza in Cabaret.The women are really nothing more than backdrops or props for the men to expose themselves. Madsen is lovely but you do wonder what on earth she really sees in this man. While he may be redeemable, he is really pretty much a self-absorbed jerk. It is most interesting that this film has been released at the same time as Closer, as they are similar in their exploration of self-absorption. Though Closer explores how destructive its characters are to each other, in the end, Closer is not as intimate and seems more artificial than the sweetly revealing Sideways.",Sideways
313,angry127,Great,9,11 January 2011,"This movie really took my by surprise. I heard that it was a good movie from fellow wine drinkers. I was expecting them to have said that only because wine enthusiasm was a large portion of the movie. The film is also something of a small masterpiece as well.I have never been a huge fan of Alexander Payne. But, it seems he has proved me wrong. I don't think many other directors would have been able to have the courage to make a movie with the same pacing and depth of a book. His direction and screenplay are a testament of what can be done if a director really wants to keep the all that is pleasurable within a book and make his movie. Certain scenes of more importance progress slowly, at the pace of life one might say. One scene that did this and had an extraordinary impact was when Miles was talking to Maya for their first date. I think this scene alone really spoke many more words about Miles and Maya as people and their connection together than could be done with any collage or montage or juxtaposition of many different scenes.Aside from that the main feature about the movie (the character traits of Miles and Jack) was quite fascinating. Everyone knows someone that would fit into either personality. Some people have too much of a lust for life, others have too little. I suppose there is no such thing as a middle ground in this regard. We always have to make decisions and we always have to alienate people. The film comes down pretty hard on this point, almost to the level of nihilism. At the end we get a glimmer of hope and maybe don't feel so bad about ourselves while we're at it.",Sideways

It was good, I enjoyed it, and I laughed out loud a couple of times, but it wasn't outstanding, unfortunately.Giamatti was, of course, perfect, as he has been every time I've seen him, and all the performances were excellent. I was totally absorbed, and even shed a tear or two.Maybe it was because I took such a dislike to Jack! (I take the point from another reviewer that we don't have to like the characters to enjoy the film, but I really disliked him! Its a credit to Church's performance, obviously, to inspire such a strong reaction, but I simply didn't like spending time with that character) So yes, it was miles better than most films out there, but far from my favourite in the last 12 months.",Sideways

This movie was rated as a comedy and it just stayed dull throughout. There were a few scenes that made me laugh, but I think it's because the movie dragged on that I had to laugh at it. Definitely not Oscar-worthy either, there was nothing special about the acting or the story line to make it worth winning any awards.

It is not an all action packed thriller, a laugh a minute comedy or a film trying to make a point about anything. For once it is a subtle and quirky film about real people and a real event in their lives and how that event effects the two main characters. It doesn't try to gloss and make a Hollywood style play about life. It shows human frailties at their worst and best and is brilliant. I am trying to write this without revealing too much because I think it is a must see film and one that leaves you feeling quite good about yourself because you can really relate to the characters in the film they play the parts superbly and you can't help thinking of whom they remind you of in your own life. It is a fantastic portrait of human frailties and the contrasts between the two main characters, one itching to sow his oats before getting married and the other still bitter and still coming to terms with his divorce. I would have liked to have seen a bit more humour but I was pleasantly surprised and will be recommending it to a lot of my friends to watch.",Sideways
317,Cel_Stacker,"""...that's why I've found/you don't play around/with the Funky Cold Medina""",6,6 October 2006,"Upon reaching the all-important milestone of middle age together, still fledgling writer Miles (Paul Giamatti) and his friend, blind-lucky actor Jack (Thomas Haden Church) head up the California coast line and up to wine country, seeking a final fling before Jack heads off to married life. Before they can truly taste the wine, however, Miles reunites with old acquaintance Maya (Virginia Madsen), subsequently finds out that his ex is remarrying, Jack practically begins a new life with amiable hostess Stephanie (Sandra Oh), and the travails of both men's lives rapidly catch up with them.What I liked about this one was that there was nothing overtly pretentious or manipulative about the story or its execution--it is almost as if director Alexander Payne pointed the camera around and told the crew, ""Well, let's just see what happens."" It's much like life, playing itself out, and reminds us that drama and humor do indeed arise from trouble and sadness--and often, the ability to overcome them. Although the pervasive swearing got in the way for me, I came to identify with Miles and Jack and their attempt to rebel against life in general, and I laughed when life took its unholy revenge upon them.The music savvy will recognize the line I used for a title as coming from a classic Tone-Loc rap about the danger of involving alcohol in relationships. Admittedly, the wine takes a back seat here, because these guys have enough problems already, and you're just waiting for them to catch a break, in spite of themselves. It's not wonderful, but in the end, it is what it shows. You feel as if you took a trip with some regular folks, and had some laughs along the way.

The two friends are some sort of yin-yang composition. Both are presented as semi-losers but the difference is that only one of them (i.e. Miles) is aware of it.This movie works on so many levels. Most often it plays out to be a comedy although sometimes the humor is not explicitly available for the viewer. Sometimes it is a drama and sometimes it is a feel-good experience.The strongest points of Sideways are the cast and the dialog.My favorite lines: ""Jack: If they want to drink Merlot, we're drinking Merlot. Miles Raymond: No, if anyone orders Merlot, I'm leaving. I am NOT drinking any fuxxing Merlot!

I'm not sure why the reviews are so high for this movie. It is definitely a guy movie and if there's any women out there that actually loves it then god help them. Sure it has it's moments about truth and honestly but that's a tiny, tiny part of it all..toward the end of the movie. The rest is fill deceit, lies, depression, childish behaviors and you name it.One is a failed writer and still is. Still can't get over his ex even though it's been 2 years. This is a very sad, depressed and pure negative person. There is no redeeming quality in this pathetic character in the movie. It is a waste of Paul Giamatti's talent.The other is a small time actor with no future, stupid, childish, horny and has a delusional sense of moral and well...everything. His crying bit at the end not believable and it is meant to justify his treatment of women (purely as sex objects). Like I said, if any women actually liked this movie then God help them.Again the pacing of the movie is slow and this is compounded by the lack of a good sound score. It often drags at times because the music just isn't there. And aside from the two main characters there aren't much in character development at all. This movie is OVER 2 hours long and with no character development or plot.If the plot is about two screwed up guys screwing themselves and others then expect it.This was most disappointing movie that I've watched based on the ""good"" reviews.

In a very shallow way I'm glad I sat it out, just to be sure it didn't get much better. It didn't.First, credit goes to Thomas Haden Church who does an excellent job. Paul Giamatti does a creditable job, but not as fantastic as the reviews suggest. (Aside: I wish he had been in ""Clerks."") I liked Virginia Madsen, and this film is a good stepping stone for her. We'll see from her following work if it's a ""breakout"" part. Sandra Oh does her usual part, solid and pleasant to watch. She is an actress you can count on to deliver. But does good acting make a good movie?Now the bad news. Boring. Not funny. While disturbing, which is not a bad thing, it doesn't disturb for a purpose. There is neither a moral, a resolution, a redemption, just a look into the crazy garbage can of life. If this was all that was intended, why make a movie? Hand out free copies of your neighborhood tabloids.You want raw? You want meaning and insight? Rent and see ""Two Women,"" ""La Dolca Vita,"" ""La Strada,"" even ""The Bicycle Thief.""

I wish wish wish that this was the case. Unfortunately, I have a human brain and can tell the difference between dirty water and champagne. This is, unquestionably, a very bad movie.It's a movie based on a novel about a writer who's writing about himself. Please. Think back to how many pseudo-independent, underdog, art-house, pretentious as all git out flicks you've seen about writers. It's self-indulgent, that's what it is. Someone needs to tell these writers who are writing these movies about writers that, to paraphrase Watterson, saying something isn't the same as being understood. You're just muttering to yourself. That's what this movie is. Probably the author needed to write it for his own reasons, but did the rest of us really have to hear this story? The plot goes nowhere. It's a formulaic repetition of self-destructive behavior. They're driving, they're drinking wine, they're talking to a girl, hey! Something weird just happened! Maybe now the movie will get interest--nope. Driving. Drinking. Talking. The characters are flat and unengaging. Giamati's Miles is a waste of this man's obvious talent and, for the love of all things wonderful in life, who the hell puts Thomas Hayden Church in a movie? Explain it to me someone! Besides the fact that his character makes absolutely no sense and has ZERO redeeming features, he plays it in the same slack-jawed monotone that served him well as Lowell on ""Wings"" and nothing else in his career.If you're a self-absorbed, know-it-all, pretentious snob who thinks he's the smartest thing in the universe, by all means watch this film. If you're instead, you know, someone with taste who likes, what do you call em?

I happen to be a movie and music freak that loves to be playing Halo 2 with my girlfriend and love to drink whiskey and absinthe and hate bars, and clubs and crowded places in general. My best friend, a friend that I really love, is a club freak, a DJ, he's way taller than me, he loves to work out and, obviously, loves Paul Van Dyk and that sort of music that I really can't stand. We have other things in common, like being fans of Nine Inch Nails and buying CDs, but that's it. And we're best friends and enjoy being together. We even saw this movie together and both loved it. So... maybe to you our friendship isn't real. Sideways is a well written, passionate, very moving piece of film-making. All the characters are memorable and realistic. When Jack cries about his fiancée, it's not because he loves her so much, bu because he is ALONE, and she's the only person to truly care about him, and he needs that. He doesn't feel the same towards her, but she's more like a mother to him. Jesus, people. Put four feet in this planet.",Sideways

325,fdpedro,You'll never drink wine the same way again.,10,9 March 2005,"Alexander Payne has only four films under his belt, but is already one of the most interesting American directors working today. ""Sideways"" is his latest film, which got five Academy Award nominations and won in the Best Adapted Screenplay category. Consider that it was the Academy's usual ""consolation"" award of the year, for those films that stand no chance for the big prizes. And even knowing the ""small masterpiece"" of 2004 did get a good share of nominations, not even that justifies the Academy's horrible and unforgivable decision of omitting Paul Giamatti as one of the nominees for Best Actor.""Sideways"" opens and closes with a knock on a door. One leads to a funny scene, while the other closes the film in a melancholic, but optimistic tone. Giamatti plays Miles, a depressed middle aged school teacher with a great palate for wine. His best friend is Jack (Thomas Haden Church), a has-been soap opera actor who is going to the altar in a week, with Miles being the man of honor. As a goodbye to being single, Miles and Jack decide to spend the week on a trip across California's wine country. What at first seems like a fun week between buddies turns out to be an important stage in the lives of Miles and Jack as they soon start reflecting about the choices they made in life.Jack falls for Stephanie (Sandra Oh), a single mom who works in a winery tasting room, and it takes him only a few days to consider calling the wedding off. The fact that Stephanie doesn't know about the engagement doesn't seem to worry him so much. Meanwhile. Miles is getting ready to face his ex-wife, who he hasn't seen in years and apparently still loves, in Jack's wedding. That all complicates when he meets Stephanie's best friend Maya (Virginia Madsen), an oenophile working part-time as a waitress. While the film doesn't make it perfectly clear, and it doesn't need to, Miles does use his interest in wine as an excuse for being an alcoholic. When he learns Maya is taking a class on horticulture, not only is he surprised, but also realizes how he has underestimated her all this time. Madsen's monologue on how her character fell in love with winery is so perfectly delivered you can tell the exact moment Miles falls in love with her.And while Virginia Madsen's turn as Maya really is a great achievement, deserving all the hype it gets, Paul Giamatti's performance is what really makes the film. The proof of how good the American Splendor star really is here lies on the scene where Miles faces his ex-wife. While attempting to look happy with a fake smile, you can see that deep down in his eyes he is attempting to avoid an uncontrollable desire to weep. Nearly as good is Thomas Hayden Church, who plays a teenager in the body of a forty-year old, a character so likable, yet so immature.This is not a movie about wine, it's about four characters who happen to like wine. And while it does sound like a ""road trip"" buddy movie on paper, it is actually much more than that. Don't underestimate the film's comedic traits either, some scenes will bring the entire audience down to complete hysterics. Andrew Payne's best and most mature film to date, ""Sideways"" is, along with Lars Von Trier's ""Dogville"" and Michel Gondry's ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"", one of the best films of 2004.",Sideways
326,PhilauraJ,Boring,1,10 April 2005,"I guess if you are a wine expert you can catch the ""in humor"". I didn't laugh once. I thought this was a comedy. I can't figure what was so smart about it, unless critics, claiming it to be, are suggesting a vast knowledge of the world of wines is passed on to the viewer. That is undeniably true. There was so much information that I did not care to ever know about wines thrust forth in and unending almost torturous stream that I finally punched the DVD off. Maybe the end of the story brought some insightful point to light and I missed out not having been able to make it all the way through the film. But after 2/3 of the movie I just couldn't wait any longer for something interesting to happen.",Sideways
327,peter-bruck,Feeling ashamed,10,21 January 2008,"I read some comments on this movie. Somewhere I read: ""Anyone who enjoyed this movie should be ashamed of himself."" Since Sideways was one of the best movies of this century, I guess we all should feel a little ashamed. First of all: the cast. Paul Giamatti is known for playing tiny little supporting rules. As far as I know, Sideways was his first leading. And he is brilliant. Every second you know exactly how he feels, not because, but even though you don't appreciate what his character does in this movie (like stealing money from his mother). Giamatti shows all the shades of grey of his character. I've never seen acting like that before or after, and believe me when I tell you I've seen lots of stuff. The story: it's not romantic, it's not exciting, it is real. It is a true story without any illusions, it's about real people acting like real people do (eventhough most of us don't steal money, I guess, but there are folks who do without necessarily being all bad). The directing: sensitive, beautiful. The movie shows the weaknesses of human beings. And the cast is so great, it makes the movie special. Please do watch this movie without being ashamed of liking it.",Sideways

Go with your compadres, who won't be repelled by the two magnetic poles of Miles and Jack.I hesitate to use the hackneyed old term ""buddy picture"", but that is what ""Sideways"" boils down to. Most men can be reduced, if need be, to the simple categories exemplified by Thomas ""Wings"" Church and Paul ""My Daddy Was Baseball Commissioner"" Giamatti. In the extreme forms on display here, both may be repellent to women -- off the screen -- but the two can understand each other.OK, I'm a wine enthusiast. Not a snob, mind you, though no one admits to being one of these. At least I can understand Miles's obsession, if not his romantic hesitations. And, oh, by the way, what he says about wine is completely accurate, if completely ridiculous.I would say there is room for a sequel here.",Sideways
329,Flamio,A well made film. Giamatti shines.,8,23 May 2007,"If you are looking for a well made film using both indoor and outdoor settings with good main actors, this might be for you. If you are looking for a moral film honoring God and marriage, forget it. Director Alexander Pane does a great job with scenery and working with the actors in this film. Paul Giamatti is pure genius. His use of facial expression and his ability to blow up out of nowhere is unmatched today. Of course, Hollywood has to bring a lot of sleaze into this film with adultery, foul language, etc...but what do you expect, they can't rely on scriptwriting! This isn't 'Left Behind'. Haden Church and Giamatti act well. The rest, well, they're OK. Madson bores me. She's about as exciting as Streep in The Bridges of Madison County, and has obviously modeled herself after her acting style. Maybe it was the film, but she is very average in this. You actually feel sorry for Paul in this film but not Church. Church has it all and blows it for a week of fun. Giamatti is divorced, sad, his book doesn't fly, he's bored at his job, yep, he needed a vacation. He actually wants to do the right thing but Church brings him into dark despair in this flick. I think what kept this film from getting better scores is it is overall a very dark movie. Nothing leaves you uplifted. Every character seems worse off then when the film began. If you are looking for a pick me up, leave this on the shelf! It does open your eyes to wine tasting and a little bit about wineries. Flamio",Sideways

So, they showed one guy is getting married and other guy still love his ex-wife after 2 years of divorce. So they started bachelor party week journey from going to one vineyard to other. They almost went many vineyards through which both of them started romancing two girls. So, one guy got more serious other not. When girls knows that one guy is having marriage. Both girls breakup but in this who is serious for girl his relation also breakup. In last they both patched up. In this movie actors are good and direction is also good.

331,lilballa08,What is the logic in making a film like this?,1,31 August 2006,"It is conceivable that a movie about four misfit old people could have been made into an enjoyable family film, but someone made a serious wrong turn early in the film-making process here. To make matters worse, rather than abandoning this sinking ship early on, or starting over at square one, the filmmakers appear to have blindly moved forward producing what can only be described as a disaster that will quickly find a home among the most poorly rated movies at IMDb and leave theaters quickly.The biggest question I have is why? Why was this movie made? Why was no one minding the store? Why was this screenplay ever permitted to see the light of day? I took my five year-old to the movie because the previews looked okay and we love movies. The fact that it took less than five minutes for him to get fidgety after the movie started was probably a good clue to what was ahead. He never did calm down and I'm not sure he paid attention to more than ten minutes of the whole movie.The script and sets are both beyond ridiculous and rarely make any sense at any time during the movie. Some of the acting is really over the top absurd, Virginia Madsen and Paul Giamatti come to mind. With the exception of Sandra Oh, this film seems like it exists purely to provide a vehicle for over the hill actors to bring in a little up front income. However, since this movie will not turn a profit, it is the studio that will pay price in the end and I suppose they deserve it.There are a few moments in the first 15 minutes of the movie where you have a hope that something good will happen in the movie, but we quickly discover that the purposes behind bringing this group of old people together are entirely unsound and unexplainable and the rest of the movie has been constructed around random events placed in the film for no apparent reason other than to fill the obligatory 90 minutes minimum required for all non-animated movies.Besides all of the rest of what makes this movie rotten, the worst thing of all is that there never turns out to be any plausible reason to have brought these four people together in the first place.By the time we arrived at the end of the movie, I cared so little about what happened to any of the characters, that I was just bouncing around in my seat, looking over at my wife and child and praying it would end any moment.There are real reasons that this movie is nearly universally hated by professional critics and movie-goers alike and that is that this movie is entirely unoriginal, incoherent and borders on being unwatchable.",Sideways
332,hamass-mujadid,"The ""Sideways"" Effect",8,20 March 2015,"Sideways caused the ""Sideways"" Effect, not just on the audiences, but on the wine industry too. Merlot's likeness faced a rapid fall after the movie's wide release, causing audiences to like Miles' preferred brands more. Such was the impact of the movie. Not just the entertainment industry, but economics also fluctuated because of it. Sideways thus, caused the ""Sideways"" Effect.Miles starts off in the movie as a struggling novelist, and as his college buddy, Jack's accomplice for the bachelor week and the trip to Santa Ynez Valley wine country. Their course follows infatuation, obsession, one-last-desire (random sexual fling), decent and indecent gratification, wines (a lot of them), cheat, failure, and ultimately acceptance and realization. Alexander Payne shows utmost fluency—he's so good with characters and plot they feel almost real; I'm sorry, completely real. He does it with ease. It's like real people in real scenario with real outcomes—and that's what Payne aims for, so hats off, he's seamlessly accomplished that.Sideways, apart from an irregularly regular drama, is all about wines. Even Miles' crush, Maya, is a wine lover, while Jack's one-week-stand works at a bar which again is all ""winey."" No wonder why all four of them mingled together so unflinchingly, except in the end, partially. Pinor Noir, Cheval Blanc, 1961, Merlot, and everything else seemed as culturally powerful and classy as having a vintage car collection—it seemed absolutely distinguishing and novel, and given that a novelist (seemingly nerdy) exhibits such paramount knowledge about wines, the concept appeared naturally convincing for some reason.Maybe it was the correlation between alcohol and obsession, which are directly congenial to the properties of writing. And not just with Miles, this might be a reflection of Alexander Payne's likeness too, for choosing this script, not in a drunkard-way of course; I'm relating it more to the aesthetic appeal of wines, and how some people feel towards certain things for their braille-like tendencies, which is perfectly reasonable (I mean I go for certain unmentionables only because they stand out for me, it's all relative you see.) Anyway, Sideways has been enormously enlightening for me; it's so good to see movies that stand out from the norm for their closeness to ourselves. You start to feel as if they're working on your personality grooming, and nourishing you for knowledge and preference towards rarity. Movies that deal with obsession carry a generally impertinent but personally a very appreciable content, which is particularly aspiring for viewers of my category, and that's why, even after so much public disregard for movies like this (The Tree of Life, Midnight in Paris, Birdman, The Descendents, The Kids Are All Right, Up In The Air, so on and so forth,) they're able to vary/alter/upgrade the trends of authorities, and public, although the ideologically mundane take unreasonably extended periods of time before adjusting to them.Sideways's script has left such a mark that I almost forgot to talk about the cast, and other aspects of the movie. Well, as be conjectured from this statement, everything else was not phenomenal, maybe only ordinary, but I'm not entirely certain, because there is a high possibility that I didn't pay enough attention on them. With that said, I'm a big fan of Paul Giamatti, and I believe he's probably a much underrated actor. He was a reasonably perfect choice for the novelist Miles, but a little between the lines for the wine-loving Miles. However, he was never mundane, artificial, or deliberately trying to sabotage the novelty aspect. Thomas Hadden was brilliant. I haven't seen him before, and it's unlikely that I'll be seeing him in future. However, the guy was astonishing. His voice, coupled with his role truly built up the character for him. George Clooney campaigned for Jack's role, but was unsuccessful because Payne thought ""he was too big a star for it,"" but did work with him in The Descendants. I've wildly followed Clooney, but he couldn't do what Hadden did. Virginia Madsen and Sandra were merely supplements; I mean they completed the cast for the movie, but did nothing extraordinary in it. I don't see why Academy nominated Virginia for that role, but hey, I might be wrong, not all my judgments can be correct, right? If you look at it, Sideways didn't aim for mind-blowing acting; it just wanted to convey some points, and it has been successful in doing so. Sideways has thus, caused the ""Sideways"" Effect.",Sideways
333,Luuk-2,Much ado about nothing,6,12 May 2007,"What a waste of talent on an otherwise vacuous story. It is almost impossible to come up with a spoiler since their is nothing to spoil. The setting and the wonderful jazz background music are the real stars; there is no story to speak of and what little characterisation there is is juvenile, with one guy just obsessing about sex, the other about his ex-wife, and neither of their obsessions carry any weight. Had there been more contents, the fact that the plot is completely predictable would have mattered less than it does now.

The middle-aged playboy is skewered mercilessly, but the plot twists that revolve around his ""romances"" on the road are a riot, and he seems almost immune to shame or self-reflection. Meanwhile, his traveling partner is obsessively self-reflective, even though all this self-awareness doesn't seem to be very productive for him. His uptight reactions to the playboy's ridiculous ""shenanigans"" make for a very funny movie if you aren't prudish (it's pretty graphic, and not real pretty at times!). But somehow in the middle of all the farce, there are moments of real emotional honesty that don't seem forced and don't upset the generally comedic mood of the piece. I don't know of another movie that balances farce and seriousness so well. The movie made me laugh from beginning to end, but I still cared about the two main characters in the end. They were ridiculous, but not objects of ridicule.",Sideways

337,Ata-2,Don't miss this one,10,28 October 2004,"I've seen a lot of great movies this year, and like good wine, each one was a separate and wonderful experience in its own right. Sideways really stands out among them as the very finest. On the surface it is a comedy about a week in the life of two men on something of a cross between a wine-tasting expedition and the last taste of freedom before marriage. But, it goes much deeper than that. You will no doubt find a part of this movie that will appeal to you at some more personal level and just as surely when you do laugh, it will be from the heart. Paul Giamatti is just wonderful in every possible way with a faultless performance, and this from someone who used to dislike him intensely before seeing this movie. Thomas Haden Church who plays Jack is equally wonderful. Neither actor steals the other's thunder at any point and it is a joy to watch them. You'll fall in love with Virginia Madison's character and Sandra Oh is just so natural she surely wasn't just acting was she?The thing about this movie that struck me most was how real everything felt. None of the ""poor"" LA people portrayed in other movies that live in friggin perfect apartments that their characters could not possibly afford. The settings are the real LA with all its faults. The car windows are not clean either (ala French Connection). Ever notice how perfect the car windows are in movies? I mean I get my car cleaned all over and still the windows aren't as clean. Its little things like that, from the messy apartments to the creaky doors and half-painted walls that make this movie feel so real and sucks you in so you don't know where the time went. If you have ever wondered what that sweet innocuous waitress who served you your food does after work, you have a surprise coming.I can't even imagine anyone not giving this movie top marks except maybe out of sheer jealousy. The direction is so unobtrusive, the camera angles so spot on, and the timing is so perfect on the editing and the close-ups that its only afterwards when you can sit back and think about it, that you begin to appreciate the sheer genius behind it all. 10/10",Sideways
338,The Overdrama,OK but nothing to rave about,7,25 January 2005,"This movie is a repeat of the ""Lost in Translation"" phenomenon - a movie that picked up unmerited critical acclaim (although this movie was much better than ""Translation""). While it was an okay film, and Paul Giamatti was good (as was Virginia Madsen), it is not excellent nor is it even a comedy.Stuck in Boston during the blizzard, I ordered ""Sideways"" from OnCommand on my hotel's TV (a week before it opened wide in theaters - go fig). I wanted a comedy as it is labeled (and was categorized on the TV) so I watched it. It had no more humor than ""Lord of the Rings"" or ""Star Wars"" did. It should have been labeled as a 'romance' although that isn't even the most appropriate category.As for Thomas Hayden Church, his role was nothing noteworthy in and of itself let alone his performance. He served better as Lowell on the hit show ""Wings"" than he did in ""Sideways"" as a sex-obsessed pig. Perhaps certain people liked seeing his bare buttAll in all, I recommend this movie only in three ways: 1] you are a wine connoisseur who doesn't mind your favorite subject being overshadowed by casual sex; or 2] you are not in the mood for a comedy; and/or 3] you do not have the choice of seeing a better movie.",Sideways

I recently just watched three billboards outside of ebbing Missouri. And I just have to say that that movie sucks comparing to this. Sideways is a true story about human emotions and experience. It is a true work of art that reflects the basic human drama of love. And above all, the story in sideways is genuine. The ending is especially commendable because it just ends at the writer stopping at the waitress' apartment. And we all know that they are going to get together. Because the film just ends in front of the apartment and right after the knock on the door, we all experience a sense of fulfillment. This film is generally a enjoyable experience with the beautiful and sunny Californian wine country as a background.

Before I begin, I'll say this. This review may contain spoilers, but it won't matter, since the film isn't worth viewing anyway.What's it about? Well, it's about a couple of old college chums who go on a wine-tasting trip, prior to the marriage of one of them. They talk, they drink wine, they talk some more, they eat, they drink some more wine....and talk, talk, talk.Giamatti plays the Woody Allen type nerd, who is divorced, and is as pretentious as they come. It's easy to see why his wife left him. He's also morose and insecure. And...he's a thief, stealing money from his own sweet mother. Church is the other buddy...a not too smart, washed-up actor, who can't keep his #@@*& in his pants. They meet up with two women along their journey, and then the four of them talk, drink wine, and eat out. It's supposed to be a comedy, yet most of it is neither funny, nor interesting. (I admit that the crashing of Giomatti's car is funny, but that's it.) Sitting through this film is an ordeal, and that's not what watching movies should be about. It seems that every year, Hollywood loves to over-praise a turkey (it was Lost In Translation, the previous year), and this is the over-rated turkey for 2004. I wish I had back the two hours I spent watching this thing. I gave it a two, only because of the performances of the actors.Be aware.

342,ScooterKSU,"Quaffable, but far from transcendent",2,21 August 2005,"I finally got around to catching on of last years most critically acclaimed movies, Sideway. All during awards season, everyone keeps talking how the movie should win or how it got shafted in certain categories. So with all the build up, I had high expectations for the film. And to say I was disappointed would be an understatement.The film follows two guys around on one last hooray the week before one of their wedding. The major problem with the film is neither male lead is likable. We first catch them in a lie, then we drinking and driving, then they stop by one of their mother's because it the day before her birthday. Except the son steals her money then skips out on her before she can wake up on her birthday. So before the first half hour is over, I could care less about the characters. Thing don't get much better from their when they meet some girls on their getaway.There are also a lot of scenes that go excruciatingly long while the characters talk excessively about wine. The movie could have been cut an hour off its run time if they cut the unnecessary talk about wine. There was even a wine montage that looked liked like a montage from the Partridge Family. Okay, they like wine, now let's get on with the movie.The movie does pick up once the female leads disappear, but it's never a good sign when the first time you laugh in a comedy is an hour and a half in. I think it is easy to see why movie critics like this movie as the main character is a fail writer, and I'm sure many critics can relate as they probably have a few rejected novels or screenplay cluttering up their closets. And I find it odd how all the movie critics can pan movies like Wedding Crashers for its gratuitous nudity yet their quite a lot of it in Sideways. And referring to Sidways, by nudity, I mean male nudity. Full frontal male nudity. A lot of it. I was beginning to think there was a gay porn that accidentally got edited into the film.In the end, I can't see how anyone who isn't gay, over the hill, wannabe writer, wine coinsurer could possibly enjoy this movie.

Two hours of non-stop hilarity. Under the direction and production of Alexander Payne (Election, King of California), the novel Sideways by Rex Pickett is brought to life. Paul Giamatti (Miles), Thomas Haden Church (Jack), Sandra Oh (Stephanie), and Virginia Madsen (Maya) star in this hilarious story of life, love, and wine that redefines the term comedy.Miles, a struggling writer, and Jack, a middle-aged actor, leave their worries behind and throw all inhibitions to the wind as they depart on a week long vacation in celebration of Jack's upcoming marriage. This journey of personal enlightenment provides a visual perspective of what the novel is all about. Proving to be one of my favorite film adaptations of a novel, 'Sideways' brilliantly portrays the lives of Miles and Jack in only a week's time.While fans and critics panned this film that pushed the envelope, I found it to be one of the most character involved comedies in the past 15 years. Film goers who got out of the film two guys in search of nothing but sex, need to give this film another viewing. The character involvement that intertwines Miles, Jack, Stephanie and Maya make this a brilliant story of complexity and unpredictability.Paul Giamatti is a phenomenal actor, who portrays his finest role as Miles in Sideways. Giamatti's character Miles experiences joy, depression, and heartache during a time of personal growth. Even though the viewer expects a happy ending for troubled Miles, we get to see the long road he travels in search of enlightenment.Not only was Sideways robbed of the Academy Award for Best Picture, but Giamatti was robbed for best actor as well. Alexander Payne certainly put his mark on the comedy genre with Sideways. I am looking forward to what else he has in store for us off-beat movie goers.Love, hate, depression, happiness, beauty, and brilliant underlying themes make Sideways a solid 9/10.",Sideways
344,cncsurf,Night Train in a Château Lafite Bottle,1,4 September 2016,"This movie is just bad. BUT, it is wrapped up in a good package. People are suppose to think it's good, because all the other cool people say it's good, but it's really crap. So rather than say it's crap, people just say it's fantastic. AND HEY! There's wine!!! You have two un-likable terrible 40 something men on a bromance trip through Santa Barbara wine country. Giamati is a fine actor in my opinion and pulls off an excellent portrayal of a person everyone hates. Church is a terrible actor and pulls off the easy task of being a terrible person acted terribly by a terrible actor. The plot is so silly, the situations are so nonsensical, and the acting is so bad there is nothing to hold this mess together. Church is apparently getting married and decides the best thing he can do is go wine tasting with a horribly depressing friend to find some tail. ""Do we go to Vegas to find tail? Do we go to Tijuana to find tail? Do we go to Bangkok to find, whatever? Nope! Let's go up to Santa Barbara wine country."" To insult our intelligence the director expects us to pity this cavorting oaf (Church) after he weeps, stupidly, regretting the fact that he just slept with a few women that aren't his fiancé, when the whole point of his trip is to get tail a few days before his marriage.I understand why this movie is held in such high regard. It is Night Train poured in to an empty Château Lafite wine bottle. It looks like a fine wine. People who pay a lot of money for fine wine tell me it's fine wine. So it must be fine wine.

As Jack(Thomas Hayden Church)is set to walk down the aisle, Miles(Paul Giamatti)love life is stuck in limbo, both realizing there jaunt to wine country is there last chance to make amends for life's recent shortfalls. Miles, ever the sad sack beaming uncontrollably with low self esteem and self pity, has reached a turning point. Just like Miles, we are not sure if he's on the way up in life, or on the way down. As always, Alexander Payne movies have the ability to take the seemingly average and effortlessly create the absurd as Jack, a raging, philandering womanizer, takes his vacation to deplorable new low's. As both characters eventually get caught up in wine and women, Jack's wedding gets put on the back burner and their so-far so-good week slowly turns painfully sour. A modern day classic full of wicked humor and confronting reality, 'Sideways' is not to be ignored!!!",Sideways
347,cs100,"A 21st century, Southern California Odd Couple",8,11 January 2005,"My rating: 8/10Lemmon and Matthau. Randall and Klugman. To this list, now add Giamatti and Church.Paul Giamatti's character Miles and Thomas Haden Church's character Jack are as unlike as can be, and yet somehow are good enough buddies to spend a week together in California's southern wine country before Jack's impending marriage to the daughter of a successful immigrant family. Jack is a stereotypical live-for-the-moment aging blond California surfer-type (an actor, by profession), who doesn't delay any gratification, whereas Miles (an unpublished author) personifies delayed gratification - in fact, there are serious doubts as to whether he will ever experience any gratification at all in his life, aside from being a wine snob (and how much fun is that, really?).After a slow start to the storyline, including a diversionary trip to visit Miles' mother (which doesn't serve any real purpose in the film other than to demonstrate how desperate Miles is), Sideways gets rolling as the characters of Miles and Jack try to achieve the goal of most modern-day Americans: to be happy. Miles and Jack make very different choices, with Jack choosing the easy way and Miles, who is clinically depressed and borderline suicidal, choosing the hardest possible way in almost all situations. To the casual observer, Miles appears to be a complete loser, and yet, by the end of the film, when one sees just what Jack's choices have wrought and what his future may be like, one could very easily conclude that Miles may ultimately have the better, more satisfying life in the future. To its credit, the film ends before resolving this question, but as bad as life has been for Miles, there is indeed hope.The leads give strong performances, and are well cast for their roles. Among the supporting roles, Sandra Oh's happy-go-lucky character of Stephanie is particularly memorable. As the film progresses and the groundwork has been laid, the comedic moments build until a truly funny scene played entirely for laughs, when Miles has to retrieve Jack's wallet from his latest one night stand. Most of the comedy, however, is more cerebral than slapstick, making Sideways an excellent choice for adults looking for more sophisticated fare than the latest Austin Powers movie. Sideways is a frank look at modern-day adult romance, friendship and life, and while the picture is not always a pretty one, there is plenty of food for thought.",Sideways
348,LeslieLLKing,"Sideways - More like Intersection, between Vertical and Horizontal",8,20 February 2006,"Sideways  More like Intersection, between Vertical and Horizontal This off beat and off color film stars Paul Giamatti, as Miles, and Thomas Haden Church, as Jack, defined as friends, as assigned college roommates, from San Diego. Miles is two years divorced from his still fresh love for Victoria (Jessica Hecht). In addition, he is a struggling to be published novelist, who's soon to be married friend, Jack plays the optimist, believing Miles' book will soon be published, or is it just an additional reason to party more. Will Conundrum, Miles' publisher confirm his doubts? Regardless, Miles' intention is to treat Jack to a ""sophisticated and mellow bachelor party,"" in the coastal vineyards of California. Miles has a true romance with wines, especially Pino, which he describes known for its thin skin, complexity, and delicacy in cultivation. In complete contrast, Jack interprets this more refined experience, like spring break, on Ft. Lauderdale beach, as we imagine in his mind, beer flowing from the tap and ladies gone wild, just ready to romp and rumble. How do the two ever manage to enjoy each other's company? Most often, they simply don't. Miles' wish is to expose Jack to some of the finer wines, of California's coast, and Jack tells Miles that his goal is to be sure that the two of them get laid, by willing ladies, and of course celebrate the expected book deal. These characters can be likable and identifiable or completely annoying, depending on who you are and where you come from. Giamatti comes across down and blue. His melancholic tantrums are actually sweet and romantic, like when he runs down a hill with an open bottle of wine, after his friend tells him that his ex-wife has remarried, or when he is compelled to call his ex-wife from a gourmet restaurant, what is known as ""drink and dial."" Others may view these romantic attachment tantrums as immature, but how can't all see it as somewhat lovable? We laugh in sadness with his blues and realize how lonely life is without our one true love. Maybe there are some who can remember life without theirs.Rusty of course, Miles makes awkward first attempts, of flirtation, with Maya (Virginia Madsen) a newly divorced cocktail waitress, studying for a college degree in ecology, whom Miles has known for several years. At Stephanie's (Sandra Oh) house, Jack's hook-up date, Miles and Maya exchange talk about wines. He tells of his deep and personal affection for Pino, whose delicate grape, bodes well in the night, from the cool Pacific breezes, that lower the temperature, just right. Maya describes her vision of wine as ""living,"" that each day in the life of wine is different, and any day that the bottle is opened, it will taste unlike any other day that it existed, because it is living and always changing with its environment.Church as Jack, on the other hand, is caustic, wanting to experience his ""naughty side,"" before his marriage to fiancé, Christine, (Alysia Reiner) which all seems eerily delayed for his middle age. His blatant desire to satisfy nothing more than his sexual ego is depressing, giving Miles even more reason to be blue. Jack meets up with free and easy Stephanie, who becomes a little less than, when she learns that her new found love is soon to be married. For whatever reason, she has fallen for Jack. As a result of his deception, he suffers, painfully a broken nose, from her motorcycle helmet thrashing.At Jack's wedding, Miles meets up with his ex-wife Victoria, and her new, handsome husband, Ken (Lee Brooks). We don't learn why his marriage to Victoria fails and that missing part, leaves us more than a little curious. His heart still cares for her. Maybe he spent too much time writing and not enough time tending to her affections, like we see him do with his wine.Two roommates have two different sets of emotions and feelings on living life, just like two very different bottles of wine. Jack falls for wine and the vineyards, as a spring break fling. Miles has a deep and never ending affair with his relationship to wine. For the most part, each wine tasting experience is a process to gain full appreciation from what the wine has to offer, with exception of his wine remnant guzzling scene  absolutely hilarious but sad at the same time, breaking into Jack's world, similar to a beer bong guzzling with gusto teen, gone wild. But, why isn't Miles' love for a woman as passionate as it is with wine? Now we feel his blues. How do we ever manage to survive their vacation? One's a sudden sex fanatic looking for cheap thrills and the other is down and out, without a book deal or true love. Maybe Maya will be the one to console his heart? Maybe Jack's marriage will settle his restless hormones? This film isn't about ideal results. It's about all the unharmonious mishaps that Miles seems to fall into and that Jack eagerly invites, like that zany adventurous college boy, on spring break. This film won't gratify your fulfilled expectations for a happy ending, but it will leave you feeling a little less lonely, if you find your own life, sometimes sad, empty, unfulfilled or simply harmoniously challenged. Although I dream of a refined but relaxed textured, long lasting Cabernet, on a dark, cold winter's night, my current select choice is a Pino Gris, from the south of France, called Trimbach, traditional, but blended with an original and lively romantic charm, embodied with a unique, subtle swirl of soft and uplifting, fruity fluidity and naturalness.",Sideways

The brilliant performance from Paul Giamatti. The use of the camera to portray character internalisations and overall just pretty good cinematography. The topic of wine that the movie seemed to centre on was romantic, nostalgic, and majorly metaphoric. There was a lot of dramatic power used in the implementation of this 'Wine; topic throughout the movie. Negatives of this movie consist of the weakness of the story line. Even tho it was a solid story-line there was too much taken for granted and unexplained, and useless information given.

It's funny enough to remain enjoyable throughout, but with enough depth of tone to be moving.For me the film really works as a whole, it feels honest, and that's a powerful and rare thing in film making.

Frankly, it looked like it was probably pretty good, but how good could a middle-aged road trip wine tasting movie really be? But then came the critical acclaim and I realized that there must be more than what is on the surface. Indeed, such is the case.This is one of the few movies of the last couple years which has taken me (effectively) through all of the major emotions such as happiness, sadness, surprise, amusement, concern, etc. The connection I felt to these characters - all four of them - was impressive. What is even more impressive is that I could get this connection without being able to relate to the characters in any way - I'm in my mid-20s, not a wine drinker, not familiar with California, not divorced, etc. Still, I was able to connect in a way that I often do not connect with movies.My rating for this is a 9 and not a 10 only because there were a couple of moments that did not work 100% and there were a few directorial choices that I felt pulled me out of the narrative, but these small things do not keep this from being an amazing film. I recommend it to anyone. 9/10",Sideways
355,nikhilmanahs,A wonderful film,10,10 October 2020,"Now, I have seen this film 3 times. The test for a truly great film is, that you don't feel bored watching it again and again. The protagonist Miles is an authentic character who's going through crisis in his personal and professional life. I guess we all go through them sometimes, but even when we don't we still feel for such hurting characters . Is it sympathy or empathy or reality? I can't pinpoint but it does make us love them.The supporting cast is excellent with Maya and Jack both have been true to their character. Maya also comes as an interesting and honest character , with a painful past but somehow trying to create a better future for herself. Jack on the other hand is a carefree , philanderer who still is authentic and loveable as rotten as he is . He really loves the main character Miles and that brotherhood makes us realise that whatever we do, and even if we don't find 'success' , there will be people who still love us with all their heart.The story spans a week is paced nicely and is full of events . Viewer doesn't get bored even for a minute and the screenplay is engaging . You get hooked from the first minute. Is this because we are missing action in our lives is what attracts us to this narrative ?In the end I would say this is a very human film made up of beautiful honest people and the chase of their wonderful dreams makes us follow them and feel for them.

I kept waiting for this movie to get better, but the longer I watched the show, the more I disliked the two male leads, Jack and Miles.Miles was a petulant little boy who was mad because he couldn't have his own way. Nevermind that he was responsible for how his life was turning out. How can a person be that old, and yet so much like a big baby? He just felt sorry for himself and felt no obligation to be a mature, adult man.Jack was just a stereotypical 16 year-old trapped in a 40-something year-old body. His goal of ""getting laid"" was very noble the week before his wedding.

357,curtman2,Sour Grapes,9,3 February 2005,"""Sideways"" is an all around excellent story and film- a hilarious, endearing, entertaining concoction of human exploration, reflection, development, consternation, etc., deftly acted, written, and richly perfected in almost every respect: it's an irresistible and brilliantly clever piece of genius. Following a frustrated and agitated, yet unusually eloquent and erudite wannabe ""wine connoisseur"" (Paul Giamatti) and his virtual opposite shallow, gregarious, and hollow best friend (Thomas Haden Church), as they venture the gorgeous and breezy California countryside touring wine factories, meeting and romancing women (though the latter is engaged), reflecting on the bemusements of life and experiencing a week's surprising adventure neither had anticipated. The former, Miles, is only mildly content (and hardly ecstatic) about the prospects of the publication of his novel, and the wedding of the latter, Jack, provides the two friends an opportunity to celebrate, or as Jack bluntly puts it, ""party and get laid"". Miles is very conscientious, yet subdued, exploding with ideas yet adrift about his own seemingly anemic existence. At one point he exclaims, ""I am nothing but a smudge of excrement upon a skyscraper""; ""I have absolutely nothing to show for my life"", and we realize that he is exceedingly insecure and unhappy with himself. For the disgruntled Miles, this is a journey of self-exploration, enlightenment, and realization: he is unhappily divorced and tepid about becoming romantically involved with any woman in the near future, even with a woman who seems to take a remarkable fancy to him (Virginia Madsen),and is his complement in the world of wine and its beautiful and celestial design, taste and spirit. His precarious and engaged friend Jack, on the other hand, woos a waitress on their trip (Sandra Oh), and professes his ""dying love"" to her after merely a day of rather unadulterated acquaintance, and hardly takes a moment to reflect upon his fiancée, to whom he is a week away from marrying, and whose messages leave Miles exhorting, ""You should check your answering machine"", as if he is confused and squandering in the world of love. This is a remarkably clever and meticulously (yet quirkily) structured character study- of realizing the importance of existence and placement in our world, and of seizing opportunities and making the very best of life, even when overwhelming tribulations make it difficult for us to appreciate happiness, much less, our own existence. Alexander Payne's direction is astute, yet often fragmented, particularly in scenes of easy absorption, and always playing with transcendent moods throughout the film. The helm of ""Sideways"" is the its ingenious and comprehensive screenplay, covering practically every human emotion with all the adulteration, honesty, pragmatism, wit and wisdom you might imagine, and one of the most delectably quotable screenplays I have ever encountered. There are instances of hilarity (Thomas Haden Church is the constant comedic relief here) and instances of depth and absorption (Maya reflecting on the values of wine, Miles relating his miseries and hapless existence to her), and ""Sideways"" is an all around beautiful, enjoyable, endearing, and wholly entertaining work of film, developed realistically through character and circumstance, carried by excellent talent rather than technical extravaganza. We feel compassion and sorrow for Miles because we realize his troubles are hardly his faults, and that his kindness and wisdom should be appreciated more fairly than his existence allows. Kudos to Alexander Payne for an absorbing and adulterated screenplay and rich, attentive direction, Paul Giamatta for his insightful and neurotic performance as Miles, Thomas Haden Church for his genial and hilarious comic relief as Jack, and the tour-de-force Virginia Madsen as the tender eye of every soul Maya, in a film that is guaranteed to be appreciated and cherished for many years to come.

Santa Barbara County wines are just little brothers and sisters to The Big Place Upstate, Napa!

359,pandora8,Payneful,3,18 March 2005,"It is surprising that a movie with so many one dimensional characters in it could possibly have gotten so much praise. Though the main character, Miles, who was beautifully and subtly portrayed by Paul Giamatti, does show depth, he is surrounded by caricatures of people in the extremes of pathetic meanness, and angelic sweetness.His best friend Jack (who we can only assume that the reason they still spend time together is that Miles doesn't have any other friends), is vapid, self-centred, and supremely pathetic. He seems to get all his self-worth from seducing women, even as his wedding is quickly approaching. He has absolutely no redeeming features to him, and is perhaps the most pathetic character to ever grace the screen.All of the women in the movie are complete stereotypes, from Miles' mother (who was also quite meanly portrayed), to the wild sexy Stephenie (a surprising turn by Sandra Oh, though) complete with motorcycle, and finally the lovely, soulful, and basically ideal woman Maya.In the end it is Miles who has to carry the movie, and Paul Giamatti is up to the challenge, but is hindered by the fact that he does something so out of character at the beginning of the movie that it is hard to to believe him throughout the rest, no matter how hard Giamatti tries.What offends me the most is that this movie received the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay. Even though I didn't know that it was a book before I saw it, while watching it it became painfully obvious. A faithful adaption is not a bad thing, but the dialog must at all times sound true, and especially in the speeches that were given to Maya the dialog sounded too writerly to feel genuine.All in all Sideways is the meanest movie of 2004, and it had some tough competition this year. The director Alexander Payne always seems to hate his characters, and seems to think that if one just shows the bad things that equals a full, and realistic character.

362,cosmicly,The main character is really.....,7,17 January 2011,"Most of the people who like this movie feel that the the Central California Wine Country was simply a ""backdrop"" for a story about middle age angst.And curiously, when the film was released in Italy, it was entitled ""Un Viaggio con Jack,"" which implies that first and foremost it is a ""buddy movie,"" and that Miles's friendship with Jack--as illuminated by this one week pre-wedding adventure--is at the core.Although I respect both viewpoints, I would argue that wrapped in a ""buddy story"" inside a ""romantic drama"" within a ""fear of aging and failure tale"" is first and foremost an Ode to the Wonders of the Central California Wine Country.Author Rex Pickett clearly fell in love with the region while he was researching his book. And rather than the region being a ""backdrop"" for the story of the characters, it is the other way around. The story of the characters is a ""backdrop"" for a tribute to the region.It is a well known fact that people fall in love with cities and towns and small islands. San Francisco, Venice, New York, Paris, Acapulco, Saint Petersburg, Hawaii, and so many, many other irresistible places are literally Objects of Love for people who adore them, get to know them, and want to spend their lives with them and grow old with them.So it is with SIDEWAYS. The characters are fascinating, the exceptional rendering of the unavoidable ""cold feet"" and ""buyer's remorse"" that afflicts soon-to-be-weds is unforgettable. But at the heart of this movie is an invitation to come to know the extraordinary culture of the Central California Coast that revolves around wine, the quest to appreciate the ""living nature"" of wine, an appreciation of living close to the land, and a reverence for everything special about the history of the region--the Missions, the Vineyards, and a spirit of pride and hospitality that is perhaps rivaled only by the undeniable warmth of the people who live along the Mediterranean Sea.",Sideways
363,LondonOnMyMind,Charming quirks in a wine glass,9,13 May 2005,"Sideways is one of those offbeat films that you either love or hate. It is a film that either makes you laugh, maybe even cry, at the absurdity of its characters, or makes you want to watch something else, as simple as that. I belong in the former group, on both counts. I love films that describe life and its oddities, those cinematic gems that look at everyday occurrences with just the right touch of philosophy and humor, and Sideways fits the bill perfectly.Special mentions go to the screenplay and acting. The writing is funny, poignant and clever. The wine discussions provide a perfect line between melancholy and laughter, often providing insights into the characters' fears and doubts.Impressive is the least of attributes to describe the cast, particularly Paul Giamatti, Thomas Hayden Church and Virginia Madsen. Giamatti's Miles is a depressed, lovelorn mess, who we do not cease to root for; Church's Jack is a child in a man's body, who, with all his fears and screw-ups, still manages to be sympathetic; and Madsen's Maya is a person who looks at the world through curious and observing eyes, enjoying every detail. Maya's monologue about wine is one of the most honest and lyrically beautiful monologues of recent years, delivered in a subtle and elegant manner by Madsen.Sideways is a charming study of people, happiness and life in general. It lets us take a glimpse at its flawed protagonists and allows us to possibly recognize some of our own feelings in them, all through the wisdom of wine.9/10",Sideways
364,Luluhalabaloo,"""Dumb and Dumber"" meets ""Very Bad Things""",5,14 May 2005,"Sideways hit me as a very plausible plot: a best man treating his best friend to a weeklong jaunt before his wedding. This happens often in movies and in real life. It is what happens during these outings and like ""Very Bad Things"", not always are these outings as fun as they were expected. But that doesn't excuse unbelievably transparent and formulaic scenes trying to appear as something they are not.In terms of the believability: Miles seems intelligent and informed about what he likes, but it is obvious he is very mild-mannered, afraid and depressed. I think we all know someone like him. His friend, Jack, is a selfish, self-centered, instant gratification type of guy who knows he is attractive and charismatic which when coupled with a general lack of intelligence and a good dose of boorishness is a dangerous thing.Maya is great. She is patient; she genuinely likes Miles in that female caring for a broken child sort of way, and could grow to actually love him. Miles is lovable - he seems innocent and incapable of actually hurting someone maliciously. That being said, Miles' behaviour stealing from his mom/running away from her on her birthday seems incongruous and I personally cannot understand why that scene was included. There is a deleted scene of Miles hitting a dog that linked to the stealing behaviour, but to include one and not the other seemed to not create whatever kind of case the director had in mind (Miles had a dark side? Would he become Darth Miles later? Or was it to show that we all have an ugly side to us  what a revelation.) Stephanie is interesting. I am not a Sandra Oh fan  I find her smug at all times and cannot shake it. Her letting Jack get close to her daughter in all of 24 hours was bizarre but happens all the time as women look for surrogate fathers. And Jack did treat the daughter amazingly lovingly, which is the ""good"" side of Jack (developing inversely to Miles' retreat from the ""bad"" side in terms of the pacing of the movie). But he mislead her, and she embarrasses all single moms by the way she was taken in. She must protect her daughter first and she didn't, but sadly this happens all the time too. Her hitting him is not justified  she could have been arrested, and then what would have happened to Sienna? Stephanie is selfish and her and Jack were a good couple as they put sex before anything and everything else and recognized in each other the snakes that they both were.The scene with the waitress and the husband  no, it didn't seem that there was any point except to serve as a catalyst for Jack's ""turnaround"" if he indeed had one. But then, it was interesting to note how that waitress was the one dowdy character in the film and it was assumed by Jack that it would be ""grateful"" sex, but that she was the only one married (while all the other good looking people were divorced). It was also an added twist that there house was a wreck as the husband was gross and they both seemed to use her cheating as input to their sex lives. She just didn't seem that way, did she? But then, so what?!And that brings me to my conclusion  so what. This movie had nothing of real consequence to say, nothing to learn, nothing to really feel strongly about, nothing new. Had this film been made in the '70's, then perhaps it would have been more groundbreaking as these kinds of friendships and trips and lazy events were just budding. The director even comments on how he wanted to have a '70's feel to the movie. Too bad he didn't make it then. Apart from the texture of the film which I enjoyed and some of the frames, generally, the film said absolutely nothing we didn't already know, and it even fails as a ""Dumb and Dumber"" for the divorced, 40's set. I felt like the director had watched ""Very Bad Things"" a thousand times and wanted to make a similar movie but set it in something really out there, like a wine-tasting tour. Apart from the wine influence, the rest of the film is mundane, predictable, and frankly, insulting to our intelligence. Nothing smart here. It seems like the director made a supposedly sophisticated movie for the masses that the masses would ""get"" and feel great about ""getting"". Does he think that we are that dumb? In the Special stuff DVD, he seemed as smug and ""holier-than-thou"" as Sandra Oh  Oh yeah, they're married. That explains it.",Sideways
365,rosaishere,A corker,7,5 October 2005,"I watched this film out of pure interest from recommendations I had read and heard. I was delightfully surprised.It is always a treat when a film can entertain from start to finish purely on plot on character and not rely on big explosions and gunshots like so many films of today. The film starts with the depressive Miles and his best friend Jack going on their final road trip before Jack's marriage on Saturday. The pair are out to have a final good time, tasting wine and playing golf. However, Jack is determined to have a little 'fun' before he finally settles down for good.The basic plot offer many amusing moments, and you feel yourself always enjoying this light offering from Alexander Payne (About Schmidt). The characters are all extremely interesting, but I feel it is Paul Giamatti who stands out the most as the depressive wine expert. His acting talents have never really shone through till now I feel. The film has a good overall feel, and decent performances ensure the morale at the end if fulfilled and felt by the audience. It is suffice to say that the film never deviates from its subject; wine tasting. While although not a wine expert, any keen wine taster will feel right at home settling down with a good bottle to enjoy this delightful comedy.In my mind, destined to be a classic.Rory Mckenna10/10",Sideways
366,FilmGuy34567,Sideways Review,9,16 June 2013,"Sideways- *** (out of 4): Alexander Payne returns from ""About Schmidt"" with yet another road trip movie with guys much younger but just as full of disappointment and middle-aged angst. Neither of the two lead characters are very likable: Giamatti is a depressed, anxious, and deceptive. Church's character is not only deceptive but blind and often quite impulsive and stupid. Both are not successful and both want relief from the tensions of their lives. They don't find it. In fact, they get more than they bargain for. We somehow still enjoy watching this movie because it is so human in form. It seems to be Payne's talent to find humanity in the angst and despair of life and to make those human failures into something entertaining to watch. We only watch because Payne does not take jabs at his characters, he depicts them for what they are, for better or for worse and soon his road trip film becomes a journey into human nature, human failure, and human redemption. I did enjoy it very much.",Sideways
367,pdx3525,Alexander Payne's Humorous Middle Age Mortality Tale,9,17 January 2005,"Were you thinking big when you made your New Year's resolutions last month? See this movie and think again.That broken relationship you're determined to salvage? The big promotion you're certain you can still land? Those piano lessons you've been meaning to start? ""Sideways"" shows that as you approach the second half of life, it's time to accept that some dreams, no matter much you want them, may never come true.That fact is becoming painfully obvious to Miles Raymond, a middle school English teacher in his mid-40s who has written a 700-page novel that publishers keep rejecting. Divorced, short of money, and living in a run-down rental apartment in a tired section of San Diego, Miles, as played by Paul Giamatti., is a man with plenty of disappointments.His best friend is Jack, an aging actor who once had recurring roles on television series, but now gets by doing voice-over work and other commercial jobs. To celebrate Jack's impending wedding to a young and wealthy woman, Miles takes him on a week-long road trip through California vineyards.Paul Giamatti is perfect as the neurotic and tightly wound Miles, a man who uses anti-depressants, wry humor, and his erudite knowledge of wine to get through the day. Easy-going Jack, played by Thomas Haden Church, is his polar opposite: a friendly, outgoing man who loves to flirt and chase women even days before his wedding.Almost immediately Jack meets Stephanie, played by Sandra Oh, and Paul finds himself with Maya, a divorced waitress played by Virginia Madsen, who is beginning to pursue new dreams of her own. How these four people spend the next six days together  and what follows after Jack and Miles return home  makes ""Sideways"" one of the funniest and most satisfying movies I've seen this year.

368,monkeysontoast,I've tried and failed to find the appeal...,5,22 July 2006,"I don't know who the first person was to hail Paul Giamatti and being a talented actor, because he's one of the dullest, expressionless actors I've ever had the misfortune to watch in a movie. That said, it's difficult for me to fathom the appeal of a movie that stars him rambling endlessly on about his wine hobby/love/infatuation, unless of course the person him/herself is a wine connoisseur, and thus, finds discussions about wine interesting. I don't. I thought the writing in the movie would be interesting and witty...it wasn't. I thought the acting would be great...it wasn't. I thought there would be an actual story...there wasn't. In what seems to be a character study film, it fails miserably, because the characters never actually develop past the unlikeable jerkoff's they were to begin with, and because of this, the audience doesn't give a care for them. Apart from a few amusing one-liner's and scenes involving Thomas Haden Church's character, the movie was completely tedious and mind-numbing. It did eventually pick up, starting with an interesting mini-speech on the part of Madsen's character, but an hour and a half too late to matter.",Sideways

I had gone to see it with high hopes as it has been pegged as a hilarious romantic comedy. Perhaps I should have learnt a little bit more about the movie before seeing it.This story follows two characters who travel around California sampling wine. One of them (Church) is getting married imminently and wants to fornicate with another woman before tieing the bond. The other man (Paul G.) is a writer who appears to be low in himself. They both appear to be in their 50's, maybe 40's. Church decides to have a fling with possibly the ugliest Chinese person I have ever seen called Stefanie. This is probably the highlight of the movie.I highly recommend this movie if you are middle-aged pretentious prat. The film reeks of forced sophistication, its tries to be clever, tries to be witty, but nothing even slightly interesting occurs in action or in dialogue. I can see how there are some people watch this movie and say ""That is so true - Merlot really does taste like that when it isn't oxygenated enough!"" It really boggles my mind how weak some of the higher rated films on IMDb are. I think some people have no idea what a good film is.

In the states TV is generally a process of achieving the greatest market penetration and it is left to the movies to play around with indi. projects since the only out is thro' that medium.

373,misslv80,"Funny, delightful, witty, charming, excellent film",10,14 April 2005,"Sideways is one of those rare movies where I read the book and then saw the film afterwards. It is one of those stories that translate seamlessly from the novel to the big screen due to the effortless direction of Alexander Payne and his attention to the nuances and subtlety of the descriptive narrative of the book, such as the sharp, witty dialogue, and the human warmth of the characters; it did not lose its warm and wonderful flavor when it was translated to the screen. In fact, while I was watching it, it never felt like I was watching a movie, which is a good thing. I never felt the actors were ""acting"". I felt like I was actually watching a documentary of these four peoples' lives.Two buddies, Miles and Jack, venture off for a week-long trip to the California wine country. You could not imagine two more unlikely men being friends. Miles (Paul Giamatti) is a failed writer who has a novel that he is trying to get published. He is also trying to get over a divorce and his friend Jack (Thomas Haden Church) is quite the opposite, a happy-go-lucky ladies man who is engaged to be married. However, Jack is on the prowl for his last hurrah with Stephanie, played by Sandra Oh. Miles also meets up with a warm-hearted waitress named Maya (Virginia Madsen), who is also trying to get over a divorce.The four characters are very well-developed. Never once does the action lag in the storyline. It has a great pace and rhythm. There was quite a bit of dialogue I recognized from the novel and many scenes from the novel that Payne did keep in that were integral to the storyline of the film that I was happy with. The movie is very faithful to the book. Of course, since I read the novel first, I noticed there were some plot changes to the original story, but I recognize and respect Payne's decisions as to why these changes were made and these changes actually made the movie stronger as a result. The split screen montages of Jack and Miles traveling through the wine country are reminiscent of cinema from the 60s or 70s.Even though the story is very dialogue heavy, do not mistake this movie as something slow and boring, as some human interest films tend to be. No, you will not only be laughing hysterically, as it is one of the best dark comedies I have ever seen, but don't be surprised if it moves you to tears at times. The scene where Madsen's character Maya talks about the life inside a bottle of wine is probably one of the best monologues I have ever seen on film. This film will definitely make you think and it is one of those you will be recommending to your friends. However, I would recommend you read the novel first because it will put the story into perspective more. Excellent ensemble cast, first-rate directing, and wonderful cinematography. Its nomination for Best Picture was very much deserved. Recommended highly to all.",Sideways
374,Bandit1974,Would You Like Some Cheese With That Whine?,10,7 January 2006,"I will be the first to admit that I HATED this movie the first time I saw it. I should also add that I no longer rent movies. With the price of DVDs being as low as they are I buy all the movies I want to see. I tend to buy a lot of movies that I've never seen before. Since I am a fan of many genres I rarely get ""burned"" but when I first saw Sideways I felt barbecued.But this movie received so much praise from critics and movie goers that I had to give it another shot. The first time I saw it I was totally hung over (how appropriate considering the movie) so that may have affected my experience. It was around the third or fourth viewing that I fell in love with this gem and finally ""got"" it.My mother hated this movie. My mom is one of those people that has a difficult time watching a movie that is about, well, losers. And that is precisely what the main characters, Miles and Jack, in this movie are. People want to escape when they go to the movies. Sideways might be a little too close to reality for people like my mother. The reality being that there is nothing terribly unique or admirable about Miles and Jack. One steals money from his mother and the other wants to get laid one last time before he gets married. I got news for you. The world is made up of morally corrupt people like Miles and Jack.Miles and Jack embark on a week long journey of wine tasting to celebrate the fact that Jack is getting married. Jack has other intentions. For the entire trip Jack is chasing women. It's obvious that the idea of marriage isn't sitting to well with him.Miles on the other hand is still wallowing in sorrow over his marriage that ended two years ago. Perhaps one of the reasons I disliked this movie so much when I first saw it is because throughout my life I have met people exactly like Miles. People who are intent on being depressed. People who truly dislike life. People who embrace misery. People who would complain about paying taxes if they won the lottery. To his credit Paul Giamatti does an excellent job of playing a totally unlovable loser. Oscar worthy.The one character that touched me in Sideways was Maya. Miles and Jack end up meeting two women, Maya and Stephanie, during their journey. Not only does Jack want to get laid, he wants Miles to get laid as well. Jack succeeds, but Miles refuses to acknowledge the fact that Maya is very interested in getting to know him. He doesn't want to believe that a woman could actually be interested in who he is. Virgina Madsen does a superb job of playing Maya. A woman who it would appear has made a few mistakes in her past but has learned from them. Maya is very much in touch with herself and, for lack of a better word, at peace with who she is. As interested as she is in Miles, she also seems to understand that he is a terribly unhappy person.I also love the way the movie portrays Miles as being a self proclaimed wine snob. Someone who honestly believes that his knowledge of wine actually means something more than it does. As if people actually hang on his every word when it comes to wine. Maya asks Miles why he is so into Pinot (his favorite wine). Miles explains that Pinot requires so much care and the grapes can only be grown in certain parts of the country yada yada yada. Miles isn't talking about wine so much as he is talking about himself in this scene. It's a classic. Even better is the scene where we see Miles and Jack enjoying their first taste. Miles of course explains in excruciating detail how wine tasting is to be done. The rolling of the glass to check for color, how you hold the glass up to the light to check for density and clarity and the sniffing of the wines different aromas. Finally Miles and Jack taste the wine. Miles looks over at jack and shouts, ""Are you chewing gum!"" Sideways definitely requires multiple viewings. It's a movie about real, flawed people. It's a movie about us.",Sideways
375,CC4ever,Sideways-glass of life,7,9 June 2020,"Throughout the movie, red wine runs through. The story begins with Miles's good friend Jack, who invited him to accompany him to play outside the week before the wedding. The first day was Saturday, Miles got up late, because the neighbor knocked on the door to let him move the car, and then hurried to Jack's fiancee Christine's house to pick him up, and Jack was obviously waiting anxiously. . As a result, it was difficult to set off, but Miles said that he would take a look at his mother, because his mother's birthday tomorrow, stayed in the mother's strong recall, and could not bear to go, so he stayed overnight and sneaked out the next morning and walked away . And Jack was very impatient. Later we learned the reason for his impatience.They held a completely different purpose. Myers thought that he would take Jack to drink red wine, play golf, eat good food, look at the beauty, and enhance Jack's taste. And on Monday Jack had a showdown, saying that he must achieve a goal and find a woman before getting married on Saturday. Myers was very surprised and angry, but because of the special circumstances of his friends, he had to reluctantly agree.On Monday, when they visited the vineyards, Jack told Miles that his ex-wife Victoria was married and that her husband would come to the wedding. Myles couldn't accept reality for a moment, and he collapsed and took a bottle of red wine and sipped it. Jack couldn't catch him.In the evening, I invited Maya and Stephanie to play together. When eating dinner, Myers drank too much and called the early Victoria to say something drunk. Later, the four of them went to Stephanie's house to play together. Jack and Stephanie got together. Miles and Maya drink red wine and chat. Maya asked Myers why he likes Pino. Myers said that because Pino is very difficult to grow, it needs the most careful care to grow up, and it can only be grown in specific places. The wine produced is the most flavorful. Myers asked Maya why she likes red wine. Maya said that because she thinks wine has a soul, it grows non-stop. Once opened, it is the pinnacle of its life, and then it begins to decline.Myers said that he had collected a bottle of Baimazhuang in 1961, which was intended to be opened on important days (the tenth anniversary wedding anniversary). Maya said that in fact, the day when the 61-year-old Bama Zhuang was opened was a special day.Jack achieved his goal and played fiercely with Stephanie. He even told Myers that he fell in love with this woman and was willing to give up everything and wanted to stay with her. Then everyone opened a winery together and occasionally filmed something. Miles believed, and I also believed, even thinking he would really stay and be with Stephanie. I also met Stephanie's daughter and mother. Obviously, her daughter and mother also like Jack very much. Jack has been persuading Miles not to give up Maya, saying that Maya likes him very much.And Jack said, ""A woman who knows my way of life knows that I am not a publishing writer, but a liar. In the end, she will have no interest in me. If you are as old as me and have no money, no one else will Seeing you. You are just waiting for the herbivores of the Golden Slaughterhouse.""And on Wednesday, Jack finally got the courage to send Maya home, and stayed overnight. The next day, when he was with Maya, he said that he had leaked and told Maya that Jack had a wedding on Saturday. Maya was very angry, rushed away, and told Stephanie. That day Jack learned that his book was rejected by the publishing house. The collapsed drunkenly drank in the winery and made trouble for no reason. He is desperate for life.""I've almost finished my life, but I haven't achieved anything. I'm nothing but a thumbprint on the window of a skyscraper, a stain on my finger, which flows into the sea with tons of garbage.""After Stephanie knew the truth, she went to Jack to settle the account, beat Jack, and broke her nose.The next day, unexpectedly, Jack went to hook up another restaurant waiter, Camie. In the middle of the night, she ran back in a state of total embarrassment and was hit by Kami's husband. Crying for Myers to help him get his wallet back to Kami's house, because there is a wedding ring in it, and there is no wedding ring, Christine will not let him go, he cried for Myers and said he Christine cannot be lost. He was nothing without Christine. So Miles had no choice but to help him get his wallet.Finally tossing about to go home, forged a crash to explain the broken nose. At the wedding, Miles met his ex-wife Victoria and his husband Ken. Victoria said she was no longer drinking and was pregnant. Myers smiled awkwardly.He also finally realized that Victoria could not come back to him again, and he finally let himself go and walked forward. So I went home to take the 61-year-old Baimazhuang, and I had fried chicken in a fast-food restaurant. I poured the wine that had been stored for so long in a disposable cup and drank it clean.Hearing Maya's message to him, Maya praised his good writing, who cares if it will be published, and also discussed some confusion at the end, Maya said, ""Like your novel, don't give up, Myers, Continue writing.""At the end of the story, Miles went to Maya.",Sideways

It is also a beautifully written, acted, and incisively ""Human Comedy.""In a much less favorably reviewed film, ""Shall We Dance"" (American, not Japanese version) Susan Sarandon has some dialogue about the meaning of, or one of the meanings of marriage. ""We validate each other, we validate each others lives."" Not everyone builds the Taj Mahal.And indeed, at last, the Miles character in ""Sideways,"" so truly and deeply played by Paul Giamatti, finds validation. For me this was a lovely way in which two movies validated each other. In ""Shall We Dance"" everyone had energy and life they needed to express and there were commitments they chose not to break. Most people I saw leaving the theater were simply dancing down the aisles. And the soundtrack is a killer. Gee, sorry Richard Gere didn't break his marriage vows. He simply helped his life partner dance their marriage back to life. Good going for the movie, bad going for the uncommitted critics.""Sideways"" revolves around the adventures of two almost past prime time players who are having one last try at living it up, before they hit life's downslope.

378,Fong_Chun_Kin,A very fine after taste,9,31 March 2005,"Having watched it some time ago and now thinking back about the film, I realised that I really did like it. And still do, as a matter of fact. Like fine wine, the show grows on you with time and leaves you with great moments to smile about. Metaphorically appropriate, since wine appreciation is the chosen theme of the movie.It's great to walk into such a show, with a cast of relatively unknown actors and without any conjured image of how the film will be like. I mean... a road trip with two middle-aged men who meet two middle-aged women who're not particularly stunning, visually at least... what can you expect? Yes yes, good 'o' shallow me. But I have set the record straight; I really liked the show, the cast, the script... yup, I really loved the dialogue. I've since read through a list of quotes and wow, one single movie can have so many verbal gems in it! Credit must surely go to the author of the novel the film was based on, Rex Pickett. Note: I must grab hold of a copy.The actors, Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church, fully deserve whatever accolades and acclaim they've received for their performances. They were really a joy to watch, an unlikely pair of buddies with very different personalities and agendas, yet such chemistry between them. They didn't even seem like they were acting; they were tailor-made for their roles, not the other way round. The beauty in their characters lie in their flaws. We can all identify with their weaknesses, their perceived failures in life, their desperation for any sort of success. Giamatti should have been given an Oscar nomination at the very least and Church has since snagged a plum role as one of the villains in Spiderman 3. Not bad at all.Forgive me if I fail to acknowledge the actresses, because they just didn't leave as much impact as the two male leads. I certainly can't see how Virginia Madsen got nominated for the Oscars, hers was a subtle performance at best, a rather forgettable one at worst. A mention though, has to be made about Alexander Payne, the director who seems to have such an innate ability to portray sad lives with such subtle impact. How contradictory and how unique. His previous film, About Schmidt, similarly covered depression in life, was also a joy to watch. I don't enjoy watching the characters go through their periods of sadness, but I'm definitely made to feel for them and feel with them.Sideways is definitely worth a viewing, even if you have absolutely no interest in wine (that's me), which is besides the point anyway.

Judging by both its critical and popular acclaim, SIDEWAYS is indeed a success in this human work-in-progress ""casting away of crutches"" genre. However, a 124 (albeit well-executed) minutes about dysfunctional relationships is not worth my $8.00. I'd rather go out and eat nails. What did I like?

Miles (Paul Giamatti) and Jack (Thomas Haden Church) hit the road on a trip through the wine country in Northern California  this is sort of a last hurrah for the two as confirmed bachelors seeing how Jack is getting married in a week.We begin by watching Miles shuffle through his morning begrudgingly obliging his neighbors by moving his car so that they can move, make up phony excuses for being late for an appointment, dropping f-bombs at the slightest of inconveniences and swinging by the local coffee shop in order to enjoy an espresso, a spinach croissant (enunciated in perfect French) and the latest New York Times. In short, he's me in fifteen years.Miles picks up Jack in Los Angeles (Miles lives in San Diego) and off they go to the little slice of heaven for oenophiles everywhere. The former is determined to show the latter a great time, ""We'll enjoy some great wine, play a little golf and have some fabulous dinners"". It's not too long before we learn that Jack, in his trademark 19-year-old frat boy way, is determined to snatch himself some NSA copulation before the week is up (all to Miles' horror for obvious reasons). ""But, you're getting married THIS Saturday!"" Jack is unconcerned with the moral implications and also wants his buddy to join in on the fun. Miles chafes at a ""fling""  in his mind, he was just recently divorced (two years ago). He is unable to let his ex-wife fade from his mind no matter what opportunities come up (no pun intended).Pretty soon we meet Maya (Virginia Madsen) and Stephanie (Sandra Oh from ""Grey's Anatomy"") who become the matches to Miles and Jack respectively. Maya is patient, intelligent and learned of the fine art of wine. Stephanie is scruffy, gorgeous and explosively passionate. This group goes through some turbulent moments in such a short period of time but it's suitable considering the moral vacuum that the men are living in. Soon, the cat is out of the bag and there's rage, blood and lust that hits the fan and scatters all coherence of adult life to the wind.What fascinates me is how much I dislike these two guysbut I can't stop watching to see what happens next. The ambiguity of the apparent ""life changes"" that these two undergo haunts me. Can people such as these truly change or do they just suppress? Despite the heart stomping that occurs there is a relatively happy ending for these two even though they don't deserve it. However, I strangely found myself wanting these contemptible morons to succeed. Maybe, in actuality, I just see this as wanting myself to succeed.",Sideways

The only laugh is the Sandra Oh, ""I need to be spanked."" line. She was good -- probably the best part of the film. Virginia Madsen ('Maya') has had a rather unexceptional movie career -- and her best role was probably in ""The Hot Spot."" She's talented, and beautiful, but she has had a horribly managed career up to now (obviously, an Oscar nomination is a good thing), and we who have always appreciated her, have been deprived of a decade of good Virginia Madsen films: she's done much better work than this. The film itself is just a slice of life. And not a particularly interesting slice. The audience doesn't really get to know, or care, about Miles Raymond (Paul Giamatti). So Miles has some misadventures with his friend Jack (Thomas Haden Church) on Jack's last weekend of freedom -- so what? Not to take anything away from the actors, the problems with this movie are a boring script, thinly written characters, uninspired directing, blah cinematography, awful music (sorry) that could have come out of any stock library, and a way too clever ending (i.e. pretentious).

What we have in this sour film is:Annoying characters, none of whom are likable. - Uncomfortable situations. - Unlikely scenarios. - An unengaging plot.This is the story of a depressed, snobbish, easily annoyed, divorced failed writer and his expansive, macho, immature actor best friend. Uh... right.They decide to go away together for the entire week before the actor's marriage, coming back just in time for the rehearsal dinner. Um hm.The depressed character acts annoyed and depressed, but somehow they're going to have a great time. The macho actor knows nothing about wine but is happy to go on endless vineyard tours and tastings with his (NOT gay) wine snob buddy. Are we lost yet? Okay, it gets worse. This depressed sadsack loser has a beautiful waitress in love with him in Solvang. Solvang, you know, that town near Santa Barbara which is a tourist attraction for no particular reason, with fake windmills and nothing much else there. Solvang, apparently, is the center of Wine Country. Or maybe the budget of this film was so low they couldn't afford to take the crew to Napa and had to shoot closer to LA? Why is she in love with him? Why would she even tolerate someone as annoying as he is? Probably because it's in the script.

""Attempted murder"", you say? Yeah, from a legal perspective, it was premeditated, she drove over to his hotel, she waited for him to show up, when the victim arrived she attacked him with what courts have called a ""deadly weapon"". The victim was taken by surprise and never even managed to defend himself. After he was knocked to the ground she continued to hit him in the head with the weapon. When she exhausted herself she stopped. Then she threatened the victim's friend because he also failed to stop her from doing reckless things. Her reason: the man never told her he was getting married. But did she ever take a break from the anonymous sex to ask him? She met Jack on Monday, slept with him repeatedly over several days (eleven times?). By Wednesday, this good mother had her daughter calling him ""uncle Jack"" and had this stranger putting her child to bed for her. Nice. Yet the characters rallied around Stephanie because Jack failed to tell her he was getting married. What makes it all so unbelievable is that something tells me that this isn't the first time something like this has ""happened"" to poor Stephanie. This makes me wonder why the more cerebral Maya would be friends with a psycho-drama queen victim like Stephanie. This is probably a monthly occurrence with her.",Sideways

392,kaspen12,Middle-aged to Disappointment...,10,10 February 2006,"Sideways is a strange film. At once a wildly hysterical comedy, an honest drama, and a lesson in fine wines, it is unique in a way the vast majority of modern films only dream of being. Miles (Paul Giamatti) is a failing novelist, whose vast knowledge of wines is but a veil for his borderline alcoholism. Two years divorced and clinically depressed, Miles needs to get things back on track. With his best friend Jack's wedding just a week away, the two friends head out on the road into California wine country. Miles plans to spend the week at samplings and playing golf, but Jack has other ideas.Questioning whether he's making the right decision with only seven days left as a free man, Jack wants to party, and he wants to meet girls. And he does. The girls are Stephanie (Sandra Oh), a single mother who works at a winery, and Maya (Virginia Madsen), another divorcé with eyes for Miles. While it may seem far-fetched that a woman like Madsen would fall for Giamatti (looking more like Harvey Pekar than when he actually played him in American Splendor), it works. The characters are well drawn and the performances are excellent  everything about Sideways is believable. That Giamatti wasn't nominated for a Best Actor statue seems criminal. The man gives a performance as heart-wrenching as it is hilarious; yet, as good as he is, the real star here is Jack, played to perfection by Thomas Haden Church.A former soap opera star that now does commercial voice-overs, Jack is the ultimate ladies man  every girl he meets ""has it going on."" Funny and charming, Church is the best thing the movie has going for it, even if Jack is a terrible person. About to be married, he is desperate for last minute adultery. The fact that Church can still make the character so likable is a testament to his charisma. Jack is a guy everyone knows  the arrogant jerk one hates but can never quite get mad at. And he's hardly the only flawed man in the film: Miles stops by his mother's house before the trip begins, in part to wish her happy birthday, but also to steal gas money. He is forgivable in his errs in a way Jack is not, for if his actions hurt anyone, it is himself.With five Oscar nominations, including Best Picture and Best Director, it is unlikely that Sideways will win big, if at all. (Editor's Note: Best Adapted Screenplay. One for five ain't bad.) It lacks the glossy self-importance of Scorsese's Aviator, and it only takes one look at the films' respective budgets to see why. Still, director Alexander Payne uses split-screen photography and the California landscape to make Sideways a sleek and stylish romp in its own right. This is art house cinema at its rich, full-bodied best.FINAL SCORE: 9.5/10 = A+ Payne's filmography paves the road to this road trip nicely. The fantastic Election was an absurd comedy inflected with human drama. About Schmidt was a deeply dramatic movie with lightening touches of absurdity. With Sideways, he seems to have struck the perfect balance between the two. The film rides the emotions of its characters, with sinking lows and hilarious highs. If it defies categorization, it's because it's real -- its performances are honest portraits of real people, not contrived characters designed to enact a tried plot. Million Dollar Baby was good, but for my money, this was the Best Picture of 2004.",Sideways
393,Beaucoul,"If you can put aside the hype, there's much to like about this film. Just don't set your expectations too high.",7,14 April 2005,"I finally got the chance to watch Sideways the other night. Man, was I singularly unimpressed! I'm having a hard time wondering why this movie received so many accolades. Universally loved by the critics, it appeared on numerous top-ten lists and garnered some top nominations and prizes. Most mysterious of all was its scooping up the Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar. I thought the screenplay wasn't nearly as witty as everyone seemed to describe it. Most of the clever dialogue pertained to wine, so it was a bit of a one-note for me.I found the characterizations and the situations to be just not very credible--especially the main relationship, which was the focus of the movie. The two leads may have been buddies in college, but how they remained friends beyond that is difficult to fathom. They were as unalike as two people could possibly be. I can accept the notion of opposites attracting to a certain degree, but putting these two together for any length of time would surely generate enough friction to set off a mild explosion.Outside of Virginia Madsen's performance as Maya, the acting provided few surprises as well. Paul Giamatti may be a competent actor, but I fear he is to be stereotyped by his physical appearance. Once again, he is playing a slightly altered shading of the downtrodden, schlubby nebbish: weak of chin, unfairly persecuted, petulant, with his unfocused anger always lurking beneath the surface. Sounds a bit like Harvey Pekar, no? And where'd they dig up Thomas Haden Church? This fellow just doesn't travel well to the big screen. Has he done something of merit recently of which I am unaware? The last I remember him, he was a minor character in a mediocre TV sitcom. What good fortune elevated him to the cachet of independent film star? I found his portrayal to be inconsistent, as if he never fully got a handle on his character's motivations. I guess he played it as a caricature, which to his credit was the way it was written. A character with few or no redeeming qualities, an inveterate womanizer, liar, and a parasite, his revelation of weakness made toward the end of the movie seemed to come not just from left field, but from an entirely different character.In fact, the whole ending seemed tacked on in a woefully transparent attempt to turn the complete exercise into an uplifting and oh, so artful and soulful creation. I was ready to hurl when Harvey, excuse me, Miles, looked up so endearingly at his best friend standing at the altar with his bride whom he had recently cuckolded with two different women in as many days. And I was baffled beyond belief when Miles received a telephone call from Maya hinting at a possible reconciliation. What this extraordinary woman saw in this maladjusted twerp was just too much for me to attempt to process. The final scene of him knocking on her door was the ultimate, agonizing jaw-dropper.",Sideways
394,kolyanbogie,I disagree with many others about this movie,8,19 November 2007,"I don't think it's fair to dismiss Miles as ""a failed writer"" or someone who lives a ""meager existence as an English teacher."" What is wrong with being an English teacher? What is wrong with trying to write fiction and not getting it published? The odds are WAY against you. Most people of Miles' and Jack's age are not ""succesful"" per Se, but they make concessions and make the best of what they have. To quote the cliché: ""Life is what happens while you're making other plans."" I see this movie as a character study of two guys who embark on a road trip and the subtle deceptions they encounter on the way: Miles pretending to want to see his mother on her birthday when he really just wants to steal money from her, Jack pretending he has read Miles' book, Jack misleading Stephanie so he can get into her pants, deceiving his fiancé, etc. etc.",Sideways

Simply put, this is a film about a bunch of yuppies who act like teenagers, and inbetween they display their hyper-love for wine that only Americans seem to be able to generate with so much of the posing and affectation that I can hardly stand in real life, much less in a film. The writing does have it's bright moments but the plot is meandering and the ending disturbing and far from satisfying. These people don't seem to actually learn anything about themselves and more important, about the way they conduct themselves. I guess if there isn't a car chase and shoot-ups, intelligent Americans tend to rave about any movie. It is neither a road movie, a wine movie or a good American attempt at a European film. All the intrinsic elements - sympathetic characters, interesting dialog, subtle humor and a satisfying ending -they are all missing. It's a 5 in my book only because it wasn't completely boring. I get the feeling the people who like this film bought every Bruce Springsteen album between 1976 and 1990 and then for 10 years didn't buy another record until the Nora Jones album came out.

He contrasts completely with Paul's and I couldn't figure out why these two guys were friends. Thomas' character nearly ruins Paul's. The wines and wine locations are barely highlighted, not enough for me anyway. The cinematography one would expect in such a lush region, well, wasn't.

398,Triniman,one of the year's best films,8,20 November 2004,"Sideways is receiving a lot of critical praise and it is one of the better films of the year, so far.Two friends head out to California's wine country, to spend a week together before one of, Jack, gets married. Jack is a former TV actor, still handsome in his forties, but now relegated to voice overs. He's intellectually lacking but also charming and fun in an immature, carefree way. Miles is a divorced English teacher who is obviously full of hang-ups, not the least of which relate to his divorce. He is a wine connoisseur and becomes even more driven to drink, when, on the trip, he discovers that his ex-wife remarried and will be bringing her new husband to the wedding.Jack's main mission for the week, though, is to get laid before he gets hitched. Along the way, they meet two ladies who appear to fit the bill for each of them. Stephanie (Sandra Oh) is a wild and free spirit, like Jack, while Maya (Virgina Madsen) is more laid back and happens to be another wine connoisseur. Madsen's character is also an intellectual like Miles and the two have an obvious but somewhat tentative attraction to each other.The camera loves Virginia Madsen. Seeing her through Miles' eyes, you can't help but be intrigued and captivated by her. In one scene, they both explain their attraction for some specific wine and through her explanation, she cleverly reveals how she's attracted to Miles. You can pretty much guess who the awkward Miles responds.What makes this film work is the realistic tension exhibited by Miles. He's tired of his job and is a hoping to be picked up by a publisher as a first time author. Paul Giamatti's performance is never dull because we can relate to his bruised self- esteem and he doesn't conveniently end up in unrealistic happy situations.The scenery in the valley was attractive enough to have some of the audience comment on how they would like to go there on a wine-tasting tour.This is another film where you're not positive what will happen next but you watch because the film stays within realistic parameters. There's nothing outrageously far-fetched about it, save for the wallet retrieval scene, which is really funny.Sideways isn't as funny as the trailers tried to suggest but it brings up bittersweet emotions without gratuitous ""crutches"" that most films rely on, in the absence of a quality script or direction.",Sideways

Why make this in the first place? It's disgustingly awful. The main character of the movie (I forgot his name, thats how important he is, and the movie really gets your attention doesn't it? you forget the characters names mere hours after watching it) wants to go on a wine tasting holiday with his best friend. His best friend however is only interested in having sex with as many women before he gets married. OK so how many men would do that? none? (I thought so). The characters are so absurd that you are never emotionally in touch with them throughout the movie, except for the main character and his best friend. PLEASE NOTE: The only reason i say that you would show emotion towards them is because you would feel sorry for them.Who cheats on a women who hes about to marry? (even in a movie) why marry her if you don't love her? If your so worried about her finding out, why did you cheat on her in the first place? The character makes no sense, and he just gets you sick to your stomach that half way through the movie your hoping he somehow dies because even though you don't know the woman you believe she deserves better than a cheating rat.As for the other character (Miles, was it?) hes an unsuccessful writer, who lives by himself, and only has one friend who he doesn't even see often. (Thats the one about to get married) You Feel sorry for him, he has a pitiful life.The script writers. and the directors must have felt very horny when making this movie, about 25% of this movie is dedicated to nudity/sex. (Believe me don't watch it, because its not even the good type of nudity/sex). Its just a way to lure in hopeless individuals who want to see some action and instead sit through the worst movie ever put to film.In the end of the film nothing really changes, the characters are still themselves, etc etc. Its as if the whole trip didn't even happen. You would think that the main character would (after all that) go to his BEST FRIENDS wedding, but no, he doesn't. Why? no reason, i guess he didn't feel like it.As for improvements, what would be a good improvement from making the movie better? changing the WHOLE MOVIE!This would've been a much better idea then what the director came up with: 1. The two friends go on a holiday, shortly before they reach their destination they crash and die.2. The friends get lost, and he must find a way back so that he doesn't miss the wedding.

402,Amadeus75,Full bodied in flavour like the pinot noir,8,12 November 2005,"Sideways. Released in 2004, it won an Oscar for its brilliant screenplay. So what is this movie all about? Two men embark on a road trip into the heart of America's wine making Californian countryside. They are college buddies and now facing a mid life crisis of sorts in their lives. Miles is a school teacher trying hard to get his first novel published and Jack a small time actor about to get married. Miles a divorcée is a lover, student, guru of wines and for him the trip is all about taking time off with his friend. Jack on the other hand is looking for that last sexual adventure before he comes home to get married. They run into Maya , waitressing and stephanie working at a winery. Jack and Stephanie hit it off in more ways than one and Jack is well on his way to sexual nirvana prior to his wedding. Miles very disapprovingly is an accomplice and just tags along. Soon a bond starts forming between Maya and Miles. All his life Miles has been in a swirl of negativity and does not permit him to have faith in a potential relationship with Maya. A man low on confidence he keeps a distance from Maya initially to eventually developing affection for her. Jack on the other hand continues to live for the moment with each day nudging closer to his wedding.This is a brilliantly narrated movie with characters as realistic as they come. A superlative performance from Paul Gimatti who portrays Miles the diffident, very human, well intentioned middle aged man seeking literary fame. Thomas Haden Church as Jack is again a very well etched character. Wines and Vineyards forms the perfect back ground to this very simple narrative which is smooth, fruity at times and leaving a beautiful full bodied after taste in the viewers mind. Virgina Madsen as Maya is full of restraint and subtlety , gelling with the ambiance of the settings. Sometimes a movie is to be watched not for its plot, not for its grandeur or passion but just for the ability of the characters to move into our living rooms as we watch the movie and this is one such movie.",Sideways

Unlike each of the movies nominated for Best Picture '04, I actually hadn't heard anything negative about Sideways. Perhaps it was because of this build up that I was disappointed with the end result. Don't get me wrong, Sideways is a decent movie, but not great. From the get go, there really isn't a genuine chemistry between Paul Giamatti and Thomas Hayden Church and that weighs the movie down a bit. The film also kept straddling reality and absurdity and couldn't really make up its mind as to which one it should be. In the end it wanted to be real, but threw away some things spoken about multiple times during the course of the first 1.5 hours that could have been more meaningful.Okay, but not great. Election was a better movie than this was. The movie doesn't deserve more than 7 because of the things that it lacks.

The very first time I saw it I believe I was still in high school and the reason why would anyone so much as nominate it for some B-grade reward, let alone give it an Oscar, was lost to me. Thankfully, my taste has developed significantly since then so now I can tell and bother you all with reasons why this movie should be on your watchlist at least once every 5 years.And while no one will argue with the movie's obvious satirical undertones and purpose, no one can also deny that it hits a bullseye when it comes to representing difficult friendships and other complicated relationships and feelings. Two main characters are different in almost every way, especially when it comes to dealing with the realization that, according to all available evidence, life might never get better. Paul Giamatti's character's depression does miracles for this plot - Miles is not some ""bigger than life"" type of person, he doesn't expect nor want much from life. But when even those little dreams of his end up being crushed, his own unimportance becomes too much for him. His friend, on the other hand, has already embraced his destiny. He knows he will never top that one TV show he did back in the day, and while his emotions aren't exactly clear about the subject, he's embraced the little fame he has and what time he has left in life and lives it to the fullest. That's the best type of person you can be for your own sake, although maybe not the healthiest one to be around.Another thing, the lack of any great speeches and expressions of love and loyalty only adds to the quality of the script and leaves you speechless with a lot on your mind to think about.

It's sure to sweep all nominations. Presumably the people attracted to this movie identify with the characters: over 50, shattered dreams, wounded hearts, damaged goods. The movie (and our hero) might have been saved by a remarkable twist, such as finding God and becoming a priest or perhaps having his throat slashed by a surprise cameo appearance of Jason or Freddie hiding in the back seat in any one of the torturous talking head car scenes. To be fair, ""Sideways"" would make a fine radio drama. These characters are better heard than seen. Happily, there are no obvious special effects and no supernatural denouement to explain anyone's character or their motivations. But at 123 minutes, it's about an hour too long. Your two hours would be better spent with ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding.""",Sideways
409,swetster,I'm not sure about this...,5,30 May 2005,"First of all, this movie is not a comedy. I can't really decide what it is. I think it is a cry for help.The premise of the movie, 2 middle-aged men go on a road trip to get drunk and laid. Spring break on Prozac and Viagra. The very sad truth is that there actually are people who would find this journey a worthy one.I actually did feel for the character of Miles. Yes, he is a self-absorbed whiny, loser, but we all have those moments. At least Miles knows what he is. Jack, on the other hand, doesn't even realize how truly pathetic he is until the very end of the movie. Jack is perfectly content to live a life of bull---- and Miles is still searching for something better. When he meets Maya, he gets a glimmer of the man he could be. She is able to make him see all that he does have in life. Sometimes we all need someone other than ourselves to point that out to us.Paul Giammata did some fine acting in this movie. I don't think this was a great or Oscar worthy movie but it did make me think a little. Isn't that what art is for??",Sideways
410,rogueforte,A movie in search of a sitcom,5,21 May 2005,"I like wine, but I'm not obsessed with it. This movie will appeal to wine connoisseurs. It will especially appeal to connoisseurs of California wine. Personally, I don't much like pretentious California wine snobs and this movie turned me off almost immediately the first time Miles begins explaining to his friend Jack the proper method for tasting wine.This in itself wouldn't be so bad except rather than being interesting, I found the main characters boorish, self-absorbed and dull, about what I'd expect from a 30 minute television sitcom. In fact, this movie is very similar to any movie that was based upon a popular television series except, in this case, the television series never existed. I can easily see this movie transferring to a television sitcom. Look for it in an upcoming network lineup starring no less than Thomas Haden Church and Paul Giamatti.On the plus side, it did start to pick up (a little) two-thirds of the way through (Virginia Madsen is good although the female leads weren't very believable) and the ending was better than average (but predictable). Still, I find little to recommend this movie, especially considering all the 'rave' reviews it got. At last count, it was #194 of the top 250 on the IMDb. Give me a break...",Sideways
411,ayush-06521,"Good characters, bad structure, and repeatitive.",3,27 September 2020,"I'm as confused to point out why I didn't like the film as much Miles is depressing throughout the film. I mean yes, I get it. He has a mental health issue. Then why don't they deal with it head on!
The whole film just keeps running around the bushes, trying to make audience laugh and empathise. And yes, Miles' situation does feel all relatable and realistic, no doubt about that. Butbthe whole film is simply introductory. We don't see an actual decision made by the central character. The film just kicks off. No setup, no payoff, nothing. We slowly get to know the real problem of the character, that's very late in the film. I mean, it's a great story, but it's dissapointingly ill-structured.
I loved the whole bond and dialogues between Miles and Jack (which I don't get to know why is called Derek by a women he slept with in the film).Or maybe I m just getting it all wrong. Audience is probably just supposed to switch off their analysing mind away for comedy, and just enjoy the ride.

I was disappointed but there is no doubt that Giamatti should have received an Oscar for his role. I call this movie a pseudo wino drama and I think it received a little bit too much attention for its appeal. Two positive spins to the movie have been the increased visitation of the wineries and restaurants of the region displayed in the film and the increased sales of pinot noir which has seen its prices increase. This movie deserves to be appreciated with a fine glass of wine for the excellent ensemble of actors, scenery, writing and bonhomie.",Sideways

This movie is far from being spectacular, and I guess that's in fact what they were trying to achieve here: It's the story of 2 contrasting friends on some kind of bachelor road trip. The story is not too spectacular either, but it's the way it is shown from the characters point of view that keeps you watching to the end. There are several funny scenes who really spice the partly slow and boring passages up. I rated this a 7, I know its a good movie but there was too little action in it, the story evolves pretty slow. It's a good but not my kind of movie, go see this with your girlfriend.",Sideways
414,jescci,Delusional Matsturbatory Fantasy,6,9 March 2005,"The story is told primarily from the perspective of Miles, a middle-school English teacher and aspiring novelist. It comes across auto-biographical, almost diary-like and as such is self-absorbed and self-pitying. It took me back to a time in my life when I was much younger than the Miles character and shared his misanthropic pleas - to no one in particular - to be noticed, to be seen, to be loved for who I was deep-down. Ugh.For some reason, incomprehensible to Miles, his ex-wife, women in general for the matter, don't seem to understand him, don't appreciate his gentle soulful, sensitive, romantic spirit. Double ugh. Never mind that he is an aging, out-of-shape, unattractive, depressive failure. Oh no. Those qualities are unimportant. The source of his troubles lie elsewhere, but not within.And so he seems to feel that these issues need not be addressed. I felt embarrassingly old at 22 or 23 when I learned that they did, that we're responsible for our own lives, that if we're unhappy we need to do something constructive to change, to grow. Miles opts instead to whine and moan, to wave his fists in the air and stomp his feet on the ground like a spoiled child demanding what he wants, insisting that he be loved. He never learned and because of the film's masturbatory tone never does learn that to be loved we must first love ourselves - for the gifts we were fortunate enough to be born with and, perhaps more importantly, for the pride that comes of making a disciplined effort to improve.The film is a fantasy. And an irresponsible one. It tells us we need only wait, that sooner or later the perfect girl will come along and she will be not only our intellectual equal, sensitive, kind and talented, but sexy and beautiful to boot. She will accept us willingly, eager, passionately - ""as is"". It's tough to sell a car that way, let alone a philosophy. I for one ain't buying.I'm reminded of a small French film, The Hairdresser's Husband, which was also a masturbatory fantasy, but made no bones about it. It's tone was playful and silly, it's ending tragic. In that way it was more realistic. We come away sad, but without feeling lied to.Sideways had plot flaws in addition to thematic ones. I could not see Miles and Jack and friends. They had little or nothing in common. It was left unexplained how Jack's in-laws did not question his rather odd decision to spend the last week before his wedding not with his fiancé making final plans or providing emotional support, but in the company of a male friend trekking across the California wine country. A despicable act of thievery by Miles is left hanging, unexamined, unatoned-for.All in all a major disappointment especially given the word-of-mouth hype and Oscar buzz.",Sideways
415,larry-miller,Treats the viewer as an adult,9,27 November 2004,"In the sea of commercial junk out there, this movie stands out as truly worthwhile. John Stiles' review here makes me wonder if I have anything worthwhile to say about the movie. I recognized the qualities he found that mark these two men as morally deficient. He said the director does not judge these men or their actions. And that's the point. The director did not have to rub our nose in their bad morality. We can judge those for ourselves.I found that this fine movie, like all the best movies, is about friendship. (And the best TV dramas are about executives such as Frank Furillo, Tony Soprano, and their decisionmaking process.) These are two friends who balance each other, but who, between them, do not become one total person. Yet both are saved by caring for, and being cared for by, another person, both each other and the women in their lives.Thomas Haden Church, an actor I never noticed, is quite fine, in fact, perfect as the ""positive thinking"" guy hellbent on getting laid. He is raunchy, yet a thoughtful and sensitive friend. Jack, his character, and this is for you to ferret out, may be best at lying to himself. There is as the Stiles review noted one uncomfortable and startlingly inconsistent moment. Paul Giamatti and his brother Marcus (Peter on JUDGING AMY) are both solid actors. Of the women, Virginia Madsen is a dream. But I consider Sandra Oh as Stephanie and Toni Collette (not in this movie) to be the two absolute best of the younger actresses. Ms. Oh has the unbelievable skill (or agent) to get her parts that would normally go to Caucasian women and she is thus not limited to playing the occasional and rare role that demands an Asian woman. I will see anything because she is in it. She does not disappoint on any level.I would like this movie, SIDEWAYS, to spawn a sequel I call CROSSWAYS--the same set of events as seen by the two women (or three if you count the ex-wife) characters. I wonder if, in that case, the actors themselves might not write the story.",Sideways

Kistler, Cheval Blanc, the tiresome popularity of forward-fruit Merlots these days.But that's a minor point.My original point was:Every single time Miles checked his messages, every single time Miles called his agent: There was a knife going through my stomach. I'm a writer, and I know exactly how that feels, and I know exactly how it feels to keep telling yourself that no news is good news, even when you know it's already been far too long.And that awful scene when he wandered outside, as far from earshot as possible, to hear his agent's news: Impossible to fabricate. Someone (or maybe many people) involved in the production have been through that.I would argue SIDEWAYS as a primer in every good reason not to go into writing.Having said that, every bit of it, especially Virginia Madsen's phone call at the end, validated everything I've been doing with my life for the last several years.",Sideways

I have also read the novel, seen the DVD, and listened to the voice-over by Giamatti and Clark.The music, the camera-work, the scenery, the wardrobe, the color, the lighting, the editing, the writing (particularly the adaptation of the novel), and lots of little touches all contribute to the mood and meaning. They say that comedy is harder than drama. How about a combination of comedy and drama that really works? How about such a combination, where the lead characters are not very attractive? Giamatti is excellent, but so is Clark. Lots of acting with little glances and subtle body movements. Madsen is perfectly cast and her character well-played. Many find that the interaction between Miles and Maya is not credible. It seems to me that Maya and Miles are both more than deep enough for this to resemble real life more than the movies.This may not be the most profound movie ever made, and it may not advance movie-making on a technical or technique level, but this is a very good film, all around.",Sideways
418,wheatdog,A gem,8,17 March 2005,"Sideways is a wonderful film which I'd heard of only by name and saw solely on the recommendation of a friend of mine. I found it to be a beautifully crafted breath of fresh air, such a simple premise executed to mesmerising effect. Giamatti and Hayden Church interact brilliantly and it is their chemistry that forms the solid base from which the film develops and blossoms into a truly stimulating cinematic experience, much like the wine that forms the central theme of the picture. Indeed a major star of the film is the California wine country itself, through which they journey in the week leading up to Hayden Church's nuptials. Several passages in the movie are shot in either the early morning or late afternoon and the landscapes are really something to behold under one of the awakening or fading sun. The picnic scene in particular was total escapism primarily because of this. I found Sideways to be at times fantastically funny, such that I laughed out loud (a couple of times embarrassingly so) on numerous occasions in the cinema! Giamatti is brilliant in the lead role here, consumed by apathy since his divorce. Wine seems to be his only stimulant and his occasional consternation at Hayden Church's relative ignorance (tastes pretty good to me) is a perpetual source of amusement (are you chewing gum?!) throughout their odyssey. Ultimately there's so much I could say about this film but my advice is to see it for yourself and soak it up like Giamatti's elusive Pinot Noir, his pursuit of which and his travails whilst doing so bestowing upon us our very own cinematic version. Enjoy.",Sideways

The novel on which it's based is entertaining, but if you read it, you get a sense of how smart Taylor and Payne were in their dramatic decisions: one of the rare films that is better than the original source (not that the book is bad, it's just that the film seems better at engaging the audience, at moving the audience). As he has been in everything, Giamatti is terrific: sure the other principle actors were good, especially Madsen, but Giamatti is the spine of the film. You could imagine any number of actors in the other roles, but Giamatti seemed to put on Miles as if the character were his own skin. If you haven't seen the film, watch for the scene in which Miles rhapsodizes about why he loves Pinot Noir so much when he's talking to Maya on the porch in their first date scene. It's riveting: the speech Taylor and Payne wrote is moving: a man bares his soul, tells us all we need to know about him through the way he talks about wine, but Giamatti's performance in that one monologue is powerful. One of the finest film moments in years.",Sideways

Through most of its two hours, it is a magical road trip through territory uncharted in film, literally and largely figuratively. The journey through California wine country as a backdrop for introspection is realized brilliantly by the story, dialogue and acting. Unfortunately, the film takes a sharp turn near the end, when the seemingly lovable rogue played by Thomas Haden Church has a phony epiphany that abruptly transforms genuine storytelling into Hollywood fakery. I had a hard time watching the rest of the film; the dramatic tension, the suspension of disbelief, was over.This is not unlike what I experienced with ADAPTATION, a film I loved despite its descent into wacky nonsense just when it should have been pulling all its brilliant pieces together. However, with that film, even its descent into nonsense had a plausible explanation -- the fake finale was meant to echo Hollywood's formulaic obsessions. Sadly, the climax of SIDEWAYS has no such explanation and simply left me feeling betrayed.Most of the movie is so good, it's hard not to like, but the dregs do leave a bad taste in the mouth.",Sideways

Co-Writer and Director Alexander Payne (Election, About Schmidt) perfectly captures friendship, loneliness, and regret in this enormously engaging, and hilarious but equally heartbreaking movie. Based on Rex Pickett's novel, means ""drunk"" -- the more or less permanent condition of Miles Raymond. Miles, played to utter perfection by Paul Giamatti, gives probably the best Lead Acting performance of the year (yes even better then Jamie Foxx extraordinary performance in ""Ray""). The Supporting performances are rich and natural, Thomas Hayden Chuch is an eye-opener as Jack, a former' college roommate of Miles, he plays a fading actor and horn dog junkie due to get married in a week.

As the film develops the contrast between the characters becomes quite exquisite. People commenting have made much of miles stealing from his mother, we all have flaws and this is illustrating his, he also has difficulty moving on and views himself as a victim others, but is a good person who is desperate for positive recognition. The contrast with Jack who is completely egocentric is outstanding. Who does not know someone like this? Someone who would compromise anything to experience the here and now and always comes up smelling of roses, never mind the hurt and pain in his wake.I enjoyed this film, I am a 48 year old man so perhaps I relate to it, I'm not sure, but very funny and very sad, contrasts always make for good viewing, 8/10",Sideways

Taking wine and trying to make a film out of the people that it affects was brilliant, pulling it off was even more brilliant. I think you have to have at least some kind of connection with wine terminology to enjoy ""Sideways"", but I think almost everyone can enjoy it if they've ever been in that depressed lake that alcohol, divorce and love can make you drown in. We make mistakes, we get drunk, we drive drunk and then a naked fat tow truck driver almost kills us. ""Sideways"" is filled with the kind of humor that makes us think about what we've done and what we will do... who we've hurt and who has hurt us.

428,halincoh,Delightful,9,31 October 2004,"Movie after movie, Paul Giamatti continues to excel. He represents every man who is underestimated because of stature or looks. One can empathize with his characters much more readily than one can with most male actors. No matter how much make up or how bad the hair cut, Brad Pitt does not inspire empathy in another heterosexual male - even if that male is tall and good looking himself. Paul Giamatti does ... because through nuance and expression, you also see inside the man. In this film, you feel his frustration with life, you sense his fear, his trepidation - his desire that things be different. Yet, as depressing as this SHOULD be - it's not. Instead, it's truly delightful. Much to their credit and the director's credit, every actor in this film feels real and every situation seems non contrived. Giamatti portrays a man who when he pokes his head out on a sunny day, instead of being inspired by the day's potential, thinks "" well ... somebody's gonna get some melanoma today!"" We discover , however, that he does appreciate beauty - the beauty of wine. He breathes it into his lungs, and in turn, it breathes hope into his soul.

However, the acting is superb by all of the cast and that is rare and the writing is truly genuine, real and makes one feel like a film has been made that is down to earth and one that we can all relate to, finally. Its been a long time since we have seen any decent films that are about average people but with true moments that are believable and comedic moments that leave you laughing hysterically. If you enjoy wine, movies like easy rider or motorcycle diaries than you'll love this film that makes you want to go out and buy the novel to see if there is more to the story that was left out by the sudden ending but the screenplay was exceptional to say the least.

430,TheHumbleCritic,A corrective,9,12 March 2005,"""Sideways"" has been called many things by a number of critics, so I'll try hard not to be repetitious or indulge in witticisms by comparing the strengths or weaknesses in the film to some type of wine. It's the return of the buddy flick - sure enough - smartly written, sharply acted, and though maybe a bit long, does not succumb to repetition itself. These plaudits are all true, as many others have noted, and the film's detractors have chosen to nitpick on specifics like the nondescript visual presentation or the pedestrian grouse that director/writer Alexander Payne is condescending towards his characters. The first complaint is a bit bizarre and misplaced. The romantic comedies of the forties and fifties were never subjected to such grievance because critics and the audience knew that the strength of those films lied in deft storytelling, brilliant dialogue, and natural, well-paced acting, all hallmarks exhibited in ""Sideways."" To note that the film has too many car shots or sun-soaked vistas is like saying Hitchcock didn't incorporate enough witty banter or flatulence jokes in ""Psycho."" To put it another way, if you're actually trying to figure out the details of that patio scene and how the camera is framing the whole thing instead of actually listening to Virginia Madsen and Paul Giamatti discourse beautifully about wine and themselves, then you might be missing out on the pleasures this film really displays. Concerning the second gripe, it's puzzling why any critic would consider less than flattering portrayals of characters on screen as ""condescending,"" other than a prescribing of one's worldview over Payne's. As Henry James advised, folks, we should grant the artist his donnee and then see what he does with it before judging him or the work. If Payne's outlook isn't full of smiles and lollipops, and if his heroes aren't moral paragons, or worse, exhibit hypocritical flaws (gasp!), this shouldn't be considered an error before the execution of the work. To judge otherwise reflects more on the viewer's critical temperament than Payne's wry eye.What Payne has accomplished here is incredible stuff that has been elucidated by many other erudite reviewers. The film is poignant but still edgy and hilarious, often moving between such opposed emotions within single scenes. It's no easy feat to do this without resorting to mawkish extremes, but Payne does it with ease, and one only witness the brilliant denouement to observe this balance of pathos and comedy exhibited so effortlessly. I'm sorry, but this is a fine film, and it shouldn't concern any of us whether it's ""great"" or simply ""good."" In an age where BAD films are awarded globular balls and golden nudes, I see nothing wrong with possibly over-praising something as good as ""Sideways."" Leave such trivialities of self-indulgence to well-paid, ad-supported media critics who should know better, while us amateurs can have the luxury of simply enjoying the thing.",Sideways

They've grown into different people over the years, yet are still friends. Now that's either because of a long lasting unique bond or because they're both so individually insufferable that they're forced to stick together because neither has been able to make new friends.The movie plays out exactly as it would in such a case for two friends connected at the hip from the past but not the current mind.

432,muertos,Best film of 2004!,10,25 January 2005,"""Sideways"" is a triumph any way you slice it. It's a vastly entertaining comedy with a human heart. It's the rarest of birds: a truly character-driven story where the movie takes the time and trouble to get you into people's heads and understand their motivations. You can't help but sympathize with Miles Raymond (played beautifully by Paul Giamatti), the bumbling, beleaguered wine enthusiast and would-be novelist, whose simple desires--to love someone and to have the chance to say something worthwhile creatively--seem to keep getting thwarted. Thomas Haden Church as the scuzzy best friend Jack is another brilliant characterization, and the two female lead roles--Virginia Madsen and Sandra Oh--are both extraordinarily talented actresses as well as being lovely to watch. The real star of ""Sideways,"" though (aside from the wine), is the script. It always keeps you guessing, confounds your expectations, and never delves into cheap Hollywood schtick. This is the kind of movie where throughout the film you see a cliché coming and think, ""Oh damn, I hope they don't go in THAT direction..."" and then, sure enough, they don't. The comic tone varies from pure slapstick to very highbrow cerebral stuff, and the movie makes no apologies for that. My favorite scene is Virginia Madsen's speech about why she likes wine. It's worth the price of admission just to see her give it! It doesn't have togas, sandals, superheroes, or spiderwebs, but ""Sideways"" is the best film of 2004.",Sideways

What happened to the conflict that was leading this story between both characters?? Where is the catharsis? Completely absent!yes, winemaking is a fascinating subject and does make for a fun and amusing backdrop to this story but in the end, this picture stays where it was filmed, somewhere in the vineyards of Southern California. And this film is up for BEST PICTURE????The acting is very good and I like Paul Giamatti a lot but I also enjoyed the acting of his counterpart in this film as he was well cast.

434,bluestylus,Disappointing,2,31 July 2005,"If you like Curve Your Enthusiasm, you'll most likely enjoy this movie -- it has the flavour of Woody Allen on lithium. What I can say in favour of this movie is that the cinematography was great... there were some beautiful scenes. But then often I felt as though I was being sold on wine country, and that the flick was nothing more than propaganda/advertising for California wines. But I'm a tough critique (since I was raised in wine country). Rolfe Kent made the movie what it is, and if it wasn't for him and Virginia Madsen I'd have given it a 0 out of 10. He created the perfect, jazzy atmosphere, that had you roaming through the back roads of wine country, tasting here, sloshing there. Virginia Madsen, I will add, absolutely glowed -- her character was as well-rounded in bouquet as a fine cabernet sauvignon. She *was* the movie (particularly the scene where she described why she likes wine). And Sandra Oh is always a good actress. No matter what she plays, she delivers. But Paul Giamatti was soooooooooo boring. I almost shut the movie off three times, but persisted only because I hoped it would get better. The only scene Giamatti showed promise in was when he ran down the hill like a madman into the vineyard with that bottle of wine. I laughed out loud. Otherwise, there was only one other scene that got a rise out of me, and that was when they were playing golf. I imagine it's because we've all been there, and dreamt of doing exactly what they did to the obnoxious players coming up from hind quarters. Thomas Haden Church was there, though he came across too much as a Nick Nolte knock-off. Sorry guys, I rate this movie 2 out of 10.",Sideways
435,Inserts,A thoroughly gratifying cinematic experience.,10,16 November 2004,"Sideways is the kind of movie I go to the movies for-a thoroughly delightful, gratifying cinematic experience with the focus on character and plot. Based on a novel by Rex Pickett and directed by Alexander Payne, Sideways is a buddy picture, road trip, comedy, and drama all rolled up in a seven day adventure through the wine country of southern California-yes, that's southern.Miles, played by Paul Giamatti, is a lonely heart, still not recovered from his divorce two years ago. His friend Jack, played by Thomas Haden Church, is about to get married, and the two men decide to go on a week-long wine tasting adventure before Jack settles down. The two men couldn't be more different from each other providing the story with textbook character contrast-expertly written, directed, and played. Jack's an intractable womanizer who wants to get as much action in as possible in these seven days before his apparent death sentence. Miles is depressed and frightened of any closeness that may present itself. But what Miles lacks in joy and courage, he exhibits in his deep knowledge of wine-providing the audience with both humor, and quite frankly, education. I'll never look at Pinots the same. Virginia Madsen as Maya and Sandra Oh as Stephanie round out the principle cast. All the actors do a terrific job. I simply did not see one false moment. And Paul Giamatti, again, deserves a Best Actor nomination for his portrayal of this conflicted character.",Sideways
436,masyauefa,Very recommended. You want regret watching this one.,8,24 March 2005,"Miles is a self-pitiful, problematic middle age man who is in a depression since his wife left him two years ago. Jack is man's best friend, he's dumb and shallow and going to get married, for some unknown reason. Miles who's interest in wine is far past a hobby and became an obsession decided to take Jack to a one week trip before his wedding to show him what good wine is (or actually, he wants the good wine himself). Jack, on the other hand, doesn't care much for the wine, he wants to get himself some ladies and also to get some for Miles. The movie is about the trip, nothing to tell there anymore, stuff happens.It's a comedy, but the good laughs comes only when you think to yourself that the movie is great even without the laughs. In overall the movie is just a long smile from start to end even 'though it's about problematic relationships of unlikable people. And I'm talking specifically about the two main characters, they are very very unlikable. But I think that the whole charm of the movie is there, because it's kinda down to ground. You can feel for those characters, because they actually just average people and not some ""movie heroes"".The acting by both Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church (who?) is very good, but Paul Giamatti has done an incredibly good job. Just pay attention in the scene when he meets his ex-wife (no, it's not a spoiler, she's not a part of the movie) how well he does the smile-cry face. Also there is the cinematography. You can like it or you can hate it. I liked it because it was simple like the characters and like the whole movie , but some might say that it's amateur.So all in all? Very recommended.

437,Cardinalnem,The Movie Of The Year (May Contain A Spoiler),10,13 February 2005,"""Sideways"" is essentially a brilliant romantic comedy, and its genre (with its predictable conventions)in our tragedy-preferring, ""originality""-seeking age may have interfered in some instances with a due appreciation of its excellence.Yet in ""Sideways"" Payne has done extraordinary work, making something extremely difficult appear easy and natural. His film, it's true, deals with familiar territory and is somewhat predictable, but only in the way Shakespearian comedy (to which in its moments of lyrical dialogue and its contrasting couples it bears some resemblance)is predictable. What Payne has crafted here, in fact, is the cinematic equivalent of a towering and elegant soufflé, rising so high because wholly free of either sentimentality or cynicism. Such comic work may look easy, but it's no mean feat. Consider for an example of the film's excellence the lengthy scene at Sandra Oh's house where the leading couple, Madsen and Giamatti, sit on a patio and discourse amusingly and in her case beautifully of wine and themselves. Surely no better dialogue has appeared on screen since, say, that in the highly verbal ""All About Eve."" And as a scene of male-female comedy and missed opportunity, this too rivals those in any classic romantic comedy. One would have to be a stone not to laugh at it and be moved as well. To banter consequently, as some in the press have done, about why ""Sideways"" is a GOOD film but not a GREAT one is to fall victim, I suspect, only to a bad case of self-importance.",Sideways
438,kmscb-1,More Mogen David than Dom Perignon,6,20 January 2005,"I really wanted to like this movie when I saw it. The script was off-beat. The acting was, for the most part, good. I love road movies (""Kings Of The Road"" by Wim Wenders is one of my favorite films). The background was unusual and interesting. But the directing was so nothing...so bland and A-B-C...and the structure of the film was so predictable, I grew bored with it.The praise for Paul Giamatti, playing a man I'd avoid at all costs, and Virginia Madsen, playing the perfect Earth mother, is well-deserved. Any actor who can make you pay attention to a sad sack like Miles, or believe a wonderful person like Maya would fall for him, is top drawer. And the script has some sharp moments and commentary in it along with some nice dialog. But there was a lot of padding in the story. Scenes that did nothing to further events...and did nothing to give only moments of tranquility...but only seemed to be there to makes us see that a lot of time is passing in that particular day. And Thomas Hadden Church and Sandra Oh weren't bad or even just so-so; they brought a lot of life to characters who were little more than the usual stock creatures you find in every ""last fling before a wedding"" story.But all of these nit-picky comments would mean nothing if the director had actually bothered directing this piece. I cannot think of one shot or scene that stayed with me...that haunted me...that added one damned thing to the narrative except to give it a frame to allow the characters to talk. I'm not saying Alexander Payne should have had swooping camera moves and flashy angles that called major amounts of attention to themselves, but you know...you don't have to use the basic TV movie concept of ""two-shot, over the shoulder on subject A then over the shoulder on subject B, then closeup and closeup, then back to a wide shot"" to make sure you got coverage on the film and nothing more. It's boring and suggests, to me anyway, that the director didn't really care much about the story or project. And if I get that feeling from it, then why should I care about it?I don't know, I just got the feeling that this could have been a champagne project and instead was made into your basic Mogen David Brand of cheap wine by the director's lack of interest.

439,reverb_88,A wonderful film,8,22 December 2004,"""Sideways"" has a lot more going on underneath its ""road trip movie"" appearance than many people will gather. It is also more truthful about life, love, and sexuality than possibly any other film that I've seen this year. Paul Giamatti's character, Miles Raymond, is a man who is chronically depressed and obsessed with the art of wine tasting. Miles has an unlikely friend in Jack, a chauvinistic party animal afraid of commitment, played by the talented Thomas Haden Church. We meet these two characters on a kind of bachelor party wine tasting excursion that they take the week before Jack is to be married. We quickly learn the extent of Miles's depression and also how far Jack will go to ""get laid"" before he settles down. But ""Sideways"" is about far more than just two characters either wallowing in despair or getting into trouble. It's really about finding out where they belong and also finding happiness. Miles desperately wants to find love. He wants more than anything in the world to have a relationship with Maya, played by Virginia Madsen, but we immediately see how difficult it is for both of them to let go of their previous love affairs and painful relationships. She too is obsessed with wine-tasting, which leads us to believe that the entire idea of the wine-tasting in this movie is metaphorical. The film's obsession with wine is not simply a vehicle for moving the plot forward. The centerpiece of the movie, an intimate discussion between Miles and Maya cannot simply be about wine. When we see these two characters speaking and looking deeply into each others' eyes we know that they are speaking on a different level, a much deeper level. Miles's favorite variety of wine, pinot noir, is a lot like a relationship: it needs time to grow and it requires an endless amount of nurturing and care. And the fact is that Jack knows nothing about either one of these things. There is, actually, a tremendous difference between the two characters' sex scenes. For instance, when Jack is having intercourse with Stephanie, we see the entire act in an almost comic manner. But, when Miles and Maya make love, it is serious and because it is so serious, we are not allowed to see it. This aspect of the movie reminds me of the end of ""Lost In Translation"". Many people who saw that movie were wrongfully clamoring to find out what Bob whispered in Charlotte's ear. I believed, and still believe, that it is not our right to know. Their moment is their moment, and we don't need to know. At the end of the movie, all we are left with is the hope that Jack has realized the power and consequences that come with having sex, and that Miles will find true love in his life. I loved ""Sideways"" and I am very happy to see that it has become a critical favorite in this year's awards season. I hope to see Paul Giamatti taking the award for Best Actor at the Oscars.",Sideways

Unfortunately it has lots of scenes about a minute long where the camera just lingers on something in a sentimental or dreamlike way.The main problem is that the music is truly awful. I think it's the most glaringly bad music I've ever heard in a film. It is utterly bland, tinkly, constantly light and cheerful, and nondescript. I really can't describe it any better than that, except that it mainly features a piano (or electronic piano).What's more, in the credits at the end, there is a huge credit for the ""Sideways Jazz Orchestra"". This was an orchestra?!? They're claiming that was jazz?! They get credited for this!? I couldn't believe it.And to add insult to injury there is then a long list of the titles of the pieces/songs, with the composers and performers listed, and an announcement that the soundtrack is available on CD.

While Giamatti & Company did an acceptable job of acting, the screenplay was a true hack job on a well written novel. The meaning of the title didn't even get a mention. How Payne managed to remove all the fun, passion and angst out of every character in the book is truly amazing. Characters, that in the novel made you love them one minute, despise them the next, laugh at them later were completely one dimensional. Pickett should sue and Payne should never write another screenplay.Thomas Hayden Church came across as a surfer dude with very little of the Jack portrayed in the novel. Virgina Madsen could have been played by just about any actress as both her role, as written by Payne, and her appearance were forgettable.I'm amazed at the hype, but then again, I'm amazed at the gallons of Merlot that occupy all the shelves in the grocery store.",Sideways

444,parasaurolophus,Low-brow humor for adolescents only,1,6 August 2005,"Take 2 pathetic characters, mix with generous proportions of vulgarity and repetitious profanity, and you have this childish attempt at entertainment. This insipid movie is not advised for anyone over 13.Enough said. However, I will try to recall what I have striven to repress in my memory ...If you are in the unfortunate position of being cognizant throughout the movie, you can note these factors along the way. Two men embark upon a ""road trip"" into the wine valleys of California. One, a failed writer, is Miles who is a man without confidence and seemingly without hope. He is also a character with whom the viewer does not wish to identify. Yet, the other ""protagonist,"" Jack, is without brains or character. He has been reduced to a life support system for his genitals, and his sole purpose throughout the movie is to seduce someone other than his fiancé, whom he is destined to marry soon after the trip. Jack is an even more repulsive character than Miles.For fear of creating a spoiler, I will not divulge if Jack succeeds. (Who cares.) I will also not divulge if Miles overcomes his confidence issues. (Again, who cares.) Yet, the hilarious antics in-between the beginning and end will leave 12-year-olds rolling in the aisles. For adults, the childish gags and predictable ""humor"" will be boring, the language grating, and the characterizations lacking in appeal.If there is any redeeming value for this movie, it is regarding pinot noir. Being highlighted frequently through the movie as Miles' favorite, it definitely evokes curiosity about pinot noir and wine tasting in general. This much over-looked wine deserves a boost in appreciation such that it competes with the chardonnays, Rieslings, and other popular white wines. It was known to the Romans, and it's historical value alone should encourage everyone to try it.And prior to watching this flotsam of the movie industry, I encourage anyone (over 21 and at home) to imbibe heavily in pinot noir as it may improve the movie (or destroy any memory of it). Further, it may induce drowsiness and sleep soon after the opening. This will mercifully allow one to doze through the remainder of the ordeal.

Ever want to kill yourself but can't because you need to be published first before anyone will care? Miles sure has. He is the focus of this book to movie comedy about a writer who goes on a bachelor trip with his soon-to-be married roommate from college, Jack.The back story for this movie is that Miles, a wine connoisseur, has written a book and is trying (unsuccessfully) to get it published. His best friend Jack is going to get married and they are going on a wine tasting tour of California to see his freedom away properly.Miles character is very depressed every since he and his wife got divorced about a year or so ago. He spends most of his time on wine and his middle school teaching job. Jack is a free spirited, and sometimes crude, character. This provides the perfect setting for a comedy of errors. Miles wants to stick to the agenda he set up for the trip, but Jack just wants to get laid and get Miles laid also. Miles, on the other hand, sees the reality of Jack's childish ways as a possible marriage destroyer of a marriage that hasn't even happened yet.They go to a small Inn next to a wine bar and restaurant where we get to meet Maya, Miles soon to be love interest. Maya is a quiet girl that speaks loud on the screen with her silent emotions. Miles likes her but is still hanging on to his ex and doesn't want to start another heart breaking relationship. The next day they go to a winery and we meet Stephanie, who will become Jack's infatuation over the remainder of the trip. Jack sets up a double date for Miles and him with Stephanie and Maya.

447,cowman57-1,Mid life crisis? Why not go to wine country?,9,1 February 2010,"Sideways is a tragic story about middle-aged depression and the feeling of loss of value and love that comes with getting older. I liked this movie a lot, however, despite its sadness. It is expertly written and very smart. The acting is great too: I'm a huge Paul Giamati fan, not to mention great acting by the irresistible Sandra Oh and the funny Thomas Haden Church-- Virginia Madsen was charming. I also find the overall take-away message to be something meaningful.On the surface, it was kind of enjoyable listening to all the wine aficionado stuff. The writer obviously knew a lot about wine tasting in California and passed it on to Paul Giamati's character via flowery descriptions of pinots and cabernets.The subtle, wry humor throughout, mixed in with some slapstick laughs (like the golf course scene, one of my favorites) was also great in this movie. I'm sure that this sense of humor isn't for everybody, but I admit that my movie taste is slightly offbeat.But on a deeper level, I liked this movie because of what Giamati's character learns over the course of his adventure: to be honest and true to oneself, to not give up despite failure, and to cherish good relationships.I think that the scene where Giamati and Maya are talking about why they like wine is pivotal. Their descriptions symbolize their own views on life. Paul says he likes good wine because it takes a lot of persistence and tough work to make it. It's not too difficult to see that his character is struggling to make his own life a good one through a lot of tedious, painful trying. Maya says she likes wine because a bottle is always changing and evolving in flavor over the years, as it ages. It must be taken advantage of while it's at the peak before it goes into a decline, she says. Their two perspectives on life mesh and Maya shows Paul that his life isn't over when you're middle-aged, rather, it's changing for the better.In the end, good prevails. Giamati's friend (Haden Church) learns that he's actually very lucky to have a loving fiancé and how he needs to mature a lot before he gets married. And Giamati gets over his failures and turns a new leaf over, though it takes an adventure and some pain to do it. In this way, I find it similar to the Spanish movie Lucia, Lucia, in which the middle-aged main character discovers joy in her life again after an adventure.This was nominated for 5 Oscars and rightfully so.",Sideways

Paul Giamatti is absolutely thrilling as Miles, the wine connoisseur and failed book author who is depressed over his recent divorce. Thomas Haden Church and Virginia Madsen also turn in worthy performances as Miles' best friend and female admirer, respectively. The movie is well directed by ""Election"" and ""About Schmidt"" helmer Alexander Payne, with a lovely score to boot. The film touched me deeply, for although it is a comedy the humor is very dark. The characters hit very close to home, though, and they're real, too, not clichés. This is a very deep movie, with themes that are universal to life, like the pursuit of happiness, the strong bonds of friendship, and love. It is never showy.

There was detailed character development, but I never cared about either of the characters enough to be interested in what happened to them. The approaches to life of these two middle-aged men are contrasted. One is a shallow ""go for it"", grabbing for any pleasant experience. The other is a depressed, alcoholic, lump who is just existing. The shallow one drags the depressed one around, trying to get him to enjoy life just a little bit. They get into some amusing scrapes.

It's not about all that much; rather than showing us a big heist or an intricate drama or a sob story it simply chronicles two unlikely buddies' trip before one of them gets married. But it makes us care about those buddies, and the women they meet, in a way that's pretty rare for contemporary cinema.The acting performances are first-rate all around, and the casting is excellent. I was pleased to see some great character actors who aren't necessarily all that well known, instead of the usual ""pretty boy"" and ""pretty girl"" faces-of-the-moment. Paul Giamatti deserves all of the plaudits that he has received, but Thomas Haden Church is a revelation. He plays his character superbly-- maybe even better than Giamatti does, but because his ""Jack"" may be less likable than Giametti's ""Miles,"" Church may have received a bit less recognition. Even the supporting characters, played by Sandra Oh and Virginia Madsen, seem like real people who have their own flaws but are a lot of fun nonetheless.That's one of the best things about ""Sideways"": the characters seem very much like people we all have known, perhaps even like ourselves, and they evoke painful sympathy as well as laughs. Their motivations, actions and reactions are believable yet not always predictable, so they retain the power to move and amuse us. Miles' and Maya's insights about wine reveal aspects of their personalities, their hopes and their desires that they might not yet realize themselves. Jack's empty and self-gratifying philosophizing and philandering ultimately show that he's just as lost as Miles, even if he seems more at home with himself. And Stephanie simply kicks butt.""Sideways"" seems to have a genuine affection for its characters and their predicaments that neither lets them off the hook too easily nor gift-wraps any kind of traditional Hollywood endings.

I truly have a soft spot for this special film. This is the type of film that to me does not come along very often.",Sideways
458,doubledutch,Absolutely wonderful vision of real life.,10,30 March 2011,"This a film, a real proper film, one you will revisit again and again.We all know a Miles or a Jack because they are real people portrayed by amazing actors, Giamatti is quite simply amazing.A road trip, comedy romance with heart felt sympathy and tears, this production is priceless. Jack (the lad) steers the film from one sexual liaison to the next with big trouble in between. This causes great angst for Miles as his new relationship is torpedoed by Jacks failings.Its funny and sad, joyful and sorrow, happiness and guilt, all rolled up in to one big cracker of a movie. You wont be disappointed!",Sideways
459,mholtebeck,I hated this movie,1,22 July 2017,"I hated this movie. Those are strong words, but I really did not like this movie at all.I expected a wine country version of Deliverance where we see characters develop and go through a life changing event.But there is nothing life changing in this movie. The best scene in the whole movie is when Stephanie beats the crap out of Jack with her motorcycle helmet. Yet, Jack hooks up with a slutty waitress the very same night? And after getting chased out her house and running 5 miles completely naked because the slutty waitress's husband is chasing him, he still decides to wreck his friends car into a tree to cover up the broken nose. Even at the wedding, there is no moment that says this guy is any different than he was before it started.Instinctively Miles is a less annoying character, but he really isn't. He is a complete downer, and equally annoying. It's not that I can't relate to Miles. I'm a middle-aged unmarried white male who drinks more beer and wine than I should, and teaches in California. However, I didn't find Miles a believable character.BTW- who in the hell goes to Solvang for a bachelor party? They are in San Diego, and 5 hours from Las Vegas? That's the apple picking trip for the west coast. Stephanie and Maya are 2 other characters we get to know. Stephanie is a seemingly intelligent who works at a winery, and yet allows her young daughter to meet Jack two days after they meet? No- that's not realistic. Maya is a nice intelligent girl who is divorced and working as a waitress to pay for her Masters degree. That's great- but literally that's the only thing I learned. There is nothing else to really learn about her.Paul Giamatti played his role wonderfully, but since John Adams was a more believable character- he was better there than here. The rest of the cast had lighter roles and were acceptable. The problem was I had no real empathy for the protagonist, and cheered when his supporting character got the holy crap beaten out him with a motorcycle helmet.BTW- apparently it was completely acceptable for guys to open a bottle of wine and pour into a glass while driving down I-5 in California back in 2003? I guess I never noticed.",Sideways

I actually at the time did not directly relate to the entire story, but I saw the reality of it. This story basically involving two guys who gave up on succeeding in life, gives a glimpse of the reality of most people. It's a trip and everything is temporary, but so are many of the realities they face in life and are in denial of.Everything from the cringe-worthy beginning, the numerous lies and bringing your own alcoholic drink into a fast food joint show a man in denial of the state of his life.

461,criticalview,"Finally, a movie for the rest of us...",9,20 March 2005,"Tiered of those big production, expensive Hollywood movies with very little meaning (if any)? Well, this one is just for you. Paul Giamatti (a loner and unsuccessful writer) and his college friend who is a failed actor (Thomas Church) went on a road trip to celebrate Church's upcoming marriage. Giamatti planned the trip as a wine tasting tour in California's country side. The problem is that each of them had a different purpose for this trip. While Giamatti thought it was to sample wine from various wineries, Church thought of it more as his last chance at lusting before he gets locked into a marriage that he needed more than he wanted. While traveling they met two ladies with quite different personalities that seem to match their own and satisfy their needs (as different as they are). Church found his lady to be exciting and sexually stimulating while Giamatti's intellectual and sensitive personality were challenged by this surprisingly wonderful woman that touched him deeply and awaken his buried emotions.This film was very relevant to most people with different problems involving REAL relationships with their ups and downs. There were no unrealistic soapy, mushy or over-sexed exchanges. This is a movie about two friends who failed at their attempts to realize their dreams, but somehow ended up finding meaning to their lives. Something most people identify with. Not only is this movie honest and meaningful, but also entertaining and funny. Giamatti's and Church's very different personalities with different interest provided for a mix of funny and tense moments. While the movie was serious as it dealt with real issues that we're all familiar with, it was done without leaving us loving or hating anybody in particular. All characters were very human with a mixture gentleness, caring and giving side as well as selfish and insensitive side. The casting was very good and the film was well directed. Giamatti did a great job portraying the snobby, bitter and heartbroken man with regrets over his past and fear of future relationships. Church was excellent in his portrayal of a heart breaker who is selfish, shallow and insensitive, but also gentle, caring and a good friend. The movie was never dull and very real in every sense of the word.",Sideways
462,RichardRowell328,Refreshingly Good Movie,9,28 November 2004,"This movie was an interesting original take in cinema. The movie was great like majority of independent films (or limited release films). I live in Santa Maria, California and was surprised and thrilled that the movie was filmed so close to my town and also one of the final chapters of the movie it showed Giamatti dining in what I believe was an ""Orcutt Burger"" here on Broadway St. that was suppose to be in an anonymous fast-food joint in San Diego. The whole movie I knew exactly where they were which was exciting, anyways......This is definitely the best movie of the year, and I agree with many of you in saying that this is a good test to show people and see if they have a knack for understanding the meaning of film-making. If they don't like a film like this, then the person (unless they have a good reason) doesn't understand theatre and the elementary value of film-making.The film went for about 2 1/2 hours and I wasn't the least bit bored.

Two guys go on a roadtrip and discover themselves along the way. What makes it so delightful are the rich and genuine characters. Jack and Miles are the realest screen personas in a long time. Each battling his own demons. Each asking himself, ""Is that all there is?"" Each travelling sideways.Never has a film neeeded its title more.

I thought the characters were a bit out there and not really representative of the ""change of life crisis"" men I know. However, there is a bit of Miles and Jack in every man I would venture to say. And that's what makes this movie so appealing.It was very easy to get caught up in the moment of the movie. Watching a drunken loser and male slut get plastered on great wine in the beautiful Napa country side sounds really dumber than it actually was. The best scene was when Jack decided that the car needed to be in an accident. It was such the obvious thing to do that one was amazed that he actually did it.

It seemed like just another indy film. And indeed it was... Actually, more like one of those indy films that you struggle staying awake for.Throughout the movie, I was disgusted with Mile's performance. He was awful to listen to and look at. I had no sympathy what-so-ever for him. I've seen it before... Doesn't anyone remember American Splendor? Paul seems to play the same role over and over and I'm really getting bored with it.The entire movie is about wine and relationships... YAWN... All I can say is, who cares. What is this, an huge marketing tool for the wine industry? Please.

Through the mind, heart and soul of a filmmaker like Alexander Payne you can enter forbidden territory and dive into experiences that, at first glance, seem so far removed from our own. Little tales with enormous, universal implications. Paul Giamatti, Thomas Haden Church and Virginia Madsen jump out of the screen and as soon as the movie ends we find them sitting next to us. We get home and find them waiting for us there, we even find them on the mirror looking back at us. This is the sort of movie going experience that will never get old. Its strength is in its truth. You may not like it, you may even resent it. Good, that's what art is all about. It provokes you. It motivates and inspires you. And as if all that wasn't enough, it entertains you it amuses you, it gives you one hell of a great time. I want another Payne soon in a theater near me.",Sideways
467,tgincurtin,And the message is.....,7,12 November 2005,"It seems to be concerned about the tension between the immediate pleasures and obsessions, (e.g wine, food and sex) that make everyday life worth living, and the fact that an obsession with those can lead to a lack of investment in permanence and meaning. The question is the choice between the pleasurable and the enduring. There is a tricky title to the book written by the main character which points the same way.It also seems to offer some background or explanation to why we use our lives the way we do, though it makes it clear that some of the choices are hard to justify, if not for the effect upon ourselves then certainly upon others.So what you end up with is a clever film in which there are great friendships and great betrayals. The lifestyle content is great fun and wine seems a lot like foreplay in some quite brilliant moments of acting and dialog.In the end it reminded me a lot of 'The Opposite of Sex.' A lot of the characters connect through a combination of loneliness and in this case a love of wine and good conversation. The result is a portrayal of the simultaneous risks and necessity of moving to intimacy this way. And perhaps some sort of message about being kind along the way.",Sideways
468,sixty_four,"Too Long, Bad Characters",6,18 October 2004,"Note: contains spoiler information. I respect that many people apparently liked this movie more than I did (6 out of 10). But I've got to say that it was too long, and it seemed to go from being a nice, quiet pastoral film with drawn-out subtleties to a Hollywoodized, over-the-top, blunt semi-comedy. It failed to appropriately admonish the main characters for their horrible behavior (Jack sleeping around with other women before his wedding, and Miles betraying Jack and then lying to Jack about it to his face). And it didn't seem to know where it was going. There was a bit of sloppy storytelling in this film, and quite a few poorly written scenes, but the worst thing of all was that the main characters had almost no redeeming qualities. In addition, every character outside the main three is 2-dimensional (or one-dimensional), and they go through an entire week-long bachelor party without once mentioning the words ""bachelor party."" Very odd.There were some beautiful moments in this film, and also some hilarious moments. I definitely laughed out-loud many times, and halfway through the film thought that I liked it quite a bit. But the ending sucked, and the last half of the film ruined the chance at redemption that either character had. If any good story is about change, I don't believe we saw much change from either character at the end. 6 of 10 for me, 5/10 and 4/10 from the people I saw it with.",Sideways

If you decide to take in this film, take a pillow. You won't even need sleeping pills, you'll just doze off. If road trips were like this film, there would be more car wrecks. Why the actors didn't ask for their names to be omitted from the credits is beyond me. Again, there are no redeeming qualities to this film - perhaps it was done to receive tax credits somewhere.

The neurotic tendencies of Giamatti's character, teamed with the moral bankruptcy of Hayden-Church's character, make for a movie-going experience that I didn't want to end! (speaking of which, the ending of this film is perfect!) Although I am not into wine as much as the characters in Sideways, the surroundings of the California wine country were beautifully captured in this film, and make a wine-tasting trip very attractive!

I wanted to give them both a slap sort of like Cher does in ""Moonstruck"" and say ""GET OVER IT"". Maybe times have changed but most of the guys I know were more together than this at eighteen. I wouldn't want to know either of these two.The only bright spot is Virginia Madsen. It's really good to see her again. She doesn't do enough.

Paul Giamatti's character reminds me of an old friend of mine. He wants only so much, and every girl should feel grateful to have someone like him, because he's a great guy, a great friend...but he's much overlooked because of his lack of self confidence. So, what do most losers who lacks confidence do? DRINK! There's a lot of that in this movie. There's a lot of good things in this movie.

I give ""Sideways"" a FOUR COURSE MEAL review (see my website for explanation of this review: www.kevacho.com).True this movie affected me greatly, (there were episodes in the film where I wanted to openly weep) partly because the main character, played brilliantly by Paul Giamatti, is a struggling writer, whose plight, hearkened very similarly to my own. (Barring the tantrums, stealing, and general skittish insecurities well, okay I have insecurities. But they're not skittish!) And Giamatti is another one of those actors, like Cheadle and Platt, that I relish watching, even when the movie he's in, isn't that great. But the script is deft, funny, intensely introspective, sad and depressing, and intelligent. The acting is superb, by the entire cast, and I might add, Giamatti and Church are perfectly cast. The pacing is magnificent, neither too fast nor too slow. Church is hilarious. Oh is nasty, but in a good way. And Madsen is all together amazing. She will make you love wine, or blonds or both. This is a movie about four people trying to find themselves in romance and life. This is the kind of movie that ""Closer"" (see review on www.kevacho.com) could never be, even on its best day. Why? Because ""Sideways"" is real, every part, every bit of celluloid in this film smacks of realism. It is not pretentious or boring. It just simply is. And this makes it remarkable. In a day and an age where Hollywood films are long on vacuous special effects and short on intelligence, ""Sideways"" is like a sip of deep, somber, oaky Pinot.Granted, I do have one critique. And this is a spoiler so, if you haven't seen the movie, and intend to, read no further. The scene with Giamatti's character where he steals money from his wacky mother is completely unneeded, irrelevant, and superfluous. Furthermore, it's heavy handed. I understand the director wants me to understand that Giamatti's character is not perfect, that he's fallible, which lends to his humanity. But we get that through the ENTIRE film. It is evinced that neither Giamatti's character, nor Church's character are paragons of civility and politeness. You do not have to make him a thief, stealing from his mother for Christ's sake! I mean, that's just ridiculous. You might as well have him stealing crutches from a cripple.However, this one lapse in judgment does not bring the movie as a whole down. It's that good.",Sideways

478,Cpartak,Was I the only person that DIDN'T like this movie???,2,14 February 2005,"First of, I'd like to start by saying that Sideways was one of the biggest disappointments that I've experienced in a very long time. I went into the movie theater with great expectations of a comedy that was funny and bittersweet at the same time (similar to Payne's previous film, ""About Schmidt""). I came out feeling that I had been cheated. There were so many things that I disliked about this film that I don't even know where to begin. First, neither of the two characters is remotely likable. I know that Payne was trying to show the desperate nature of Giamatti's character in the scene where he steals money from his mother. But in all honesty, can any normal self-respecting person relate to that??? I'm not trying to sound high and mighty, but I cannot think of ANY reason to steal from my mother, much less doing so in order to fund a wine-tasting trip with one of my friends. Likewise, am I honestly supposed to believe Church's character when he begins to cry about losing his wedding rings and in doing so possibly losing his fiancée? Am I supposed to overlook the fact that he had sex with two women 6 DAYS before his wedding? Give me a break. Throughout the movie I did not feel that any of the characters were real, but that scene was the most ridiculous. The second thing that disappointed me was the fact that the movie was not funny. Before I go any further I should say that I enjoy dry and subtle humor (""Being John Malcovich"", ""Curb Your Enthusiasm""). That being said, I found absolutely nothing funny in this movie. There were a few moments that deserved a small chuckle, but that's about it. Perhaps I would've enjoyed the movie more if I was a wine connoisseur, which I must admit I'm not. As a matter of fact, the wine is the best and most likable character in the movie (aside from Virginia Madsen, who was very good). On that same note, one of the only redeemable factors of this movie was the cinematography and views of the California wine country which were beautiful. Also, although I did not like or feel any sympathy towards Giammatti's character, I have to admit that he's a good actor and delivered a solid performance. My overall description of this film is that it's a mediocre buddy pic that does not deserve any real acclaim. If, however, anyone who has not yet seen it decides to do so I have this advice...Do not believe all the hype surrounding this movie and do not expect a funny comedy. You will be disappointed. I know I was.Since I wrote this review, I've spoken to several members of my family about this film and have been disappointed to find out that all of them liked it. I felt compelled to come back to IMDb and add another paragraph to my review because I honestly can't understand what it is that people see in this movie. Then, I read a very interesting review of ""Sideways"" that gave me a different perspective. The writer commented that characters in a film do not necessarily have to be likable in order for someone to enjoy watching them on screen. I thought about this and decided that it's a true statement, yet still thought that ""Sideways"" was boring and in my opinion completely unbelievable. This lead me to ponder the question of what makes a film, or more precisely what makes a character, interesting to watch. I came to the conclusion that a great film character doesn't have to be good or evil, likable or repulsive, funny or somber. The only thing that they should have to do is grab your attention and make you want to root for, and in some cases against, them. They should elicit some kind of emotions from you, whether those emotions be good or bad. Ralph Cifaretto from the Sopranos is a great example. He was a completely repulsive character that no normal human being could possibly like or have respect for. But Joe Pantoliano played him so well that you couldn't take your eyes off the screen. You had to keep watching to see what he would do next. The two main characters in ""Sideways"", on the other hand, are not the deep and complicated personalities that critics would have you believe. They're boring, overly simplified (in Jack's case), and unbearably dreary (in Miles' case) characters that give you no reason to want to know or care what they will do next. Personally, I could have cared less if Maya ends up with Miles at the end of the film. For me, that is the biggest failure of this movie. The only emotion that I felt, other than anger for having spent money on this dud, was remorse for Jack's wife for marrying such a prick and a similar sadness for Miles' mother for raising such a failure. In the end, this film fails because it's a character study of two completely hollow, one-dimensional, and uninteresting characters. I suppose I would not feel so strongly about ""Sideways"" had it not received such glowing reviews. I felt the need to express my opinion simply to show others who hated it that they're not the only ones that feel like someone is trying to pull the wool over their eyes with this over-hyped garbage.",Sideways

Sideways was recommended to me as a ""guy's version of a chick flick"" a real ""male bonding adventure."" For most guys this movie will be a 2 hour waste of time.While both Paul Giamatti and Alexander Payne provide nice performances, the material is so steeped in the mundane reality of mid-life crisis that it's not a challenge for either actor to pull this off. The prosaic story is set against the backdrop of wine and wine tasting, drawing many metaphors from its enology and culture. While the characters deliver some depth, the story did not. I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop, the dénouement. The humor is rare, low-brow, muted, just as the is cinematography. What better scenery in which to develop characters than vineyards? A panoply of a canvas to fill, however, it is grossly underutilized. I can't say that this film had wonderful character development because the characters are simply lifted from the context of everyday life. The obvious conclusion brings no catharsis for the viewer. The characters simply ""are."" Sideways leaves nothing ""to chew on"" by the time it runs its courseit's simply a long, tired vignette.This was 2 hours and 10 minutes of Ars Gratia Artis (art for the sake of art). One could carry around a video camera and capture the same provincial characters meandering through their infrequent polemic encounters in their otherwise unremarkable lives. Why would we care? What is the draw to give 2 hours of your time to this movie? If you enjoyed ""Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood,"" or if you like to sit and feed pigeons in the park, or if you are the type who can stare at the same painting for 2 hours, you might like this film.

The movie allows the actors to recite platitudes needlessly, when looks or touches might do, but leaves unenunciated the poignant and requisite challenges to its protagonists' vanities, confrontations that would result in unmaskings more hilarious and more profound than the pseudoconclusion relied upon instead. Do either of the main characters ever ""get it"" in the end? Or are they doomed to be forever falsely motivated and thus repeat the mistakes--false promises of satisfaction, imaginatively exalted--that lead to their states of permanent simmering anguish?

His impending marriage is at once his salvation and the source of great terror to him. Jack and Miles, best friends, decide to take a trip to the Santa Barbara wine country for one last fling of drinking wine (Miles is a wine geek of the first magnitude) and sex (Jack is obsessed with getting his freak on before the ball and chain is attached). The two hook up with two beautiful, wine-savvy women, Maya (Virginia Madsen) and Stephanie (Sandra Oh) who have taken an interest in them. Sparks fly, but Jack's casual deceits stretch the men's bonds to the breaking point, and cause serious hurt to the women. Giamatti is particularly good in his role as a soulful man whose pain has become so pervasive he doesn't even bother to hide it anymore. Even his alcoholism, a crutch that has sustained him, is turning savagely on him now. All four of the primary actors get some nice scenes - writer/director Alexander Payne sees to that - and all of them make the most of them. I remember Madsen from her stints in ""Creator"" and ""Dune;"" she is much more lovely and mature here, and shows herself to be a wonderful actress, who hopefully will be seen in many more provocative roles as a result. ""Sideways"" has gotten some wonderful reviews and recognition, but it left me a bit flat; Miles is a bit too passive to take a rooting interest in, and the wine geekery wears a bit thin by the end of the movie. There are some riveting moments, but the insights into human nature didn't seem to have the depth except in the case of Miles. A nice ad for winery-hopping in Southern California, which is often overshadowed by Napa Valley to the north.",Sideways

First, a lot of it is shot in in a lot of sunshine, on the road, when two friends take up a car journey for a week. In LMS it's a family that takes up a road journey.LMS is full of loser characters, Sideways has only one but enough to drown any number of souls down.Trivia : Throughout the film, Miles speaks fondly of the red wine varietal Pinot Noir.Following the film's U.S. release in October 2004, Pinot Noir sales increased 16% in the Western United States.(from WikiPedia)Note : I had seen LMS before Sideways.",Sideways

The film has everything, from humor, smarts, depth to poignancy and even suspense and one point. Payne is one of the rare American auteurs who amplifies the disappointment and regret lurking within the peppy, can-do civic culture of middle America, while acknowledging the sweetness and innocence that is still there. The real refreshment provides Thomas H. Church whose performance as Jack is for the books! What really gets me about this movie is its patience to simply ""exist"" rather than to be artificially ""plot driven.""",Sideways
488,Silver_Dollar,totally overrated,4,13 February 2006,"I must confess that I totally adored Alexander Payne's About Schmidt, which I regard as being one of the best films of the decade, and definitely classic Nicholson. Sideways, however, for all its wonderful cinematography of the Californian landscape and constant metaphors of wine, life and love fails to sparkle. The same themes of About Schmidt are revisited to a certain extent - ageing singletons on an ordinary road trip and end up finding fulfilment and purpose to life which was otherwise lacking. However, unlike About Schmidt, it is difficult to find interest or even care for any of the main characters to begin with. I remember Paul Giametti as the hilarious self righteous radio corporate 'Pigs Vomit' in Private Parts, but talented as he may be, he could not anchor the film in the leading role as lonely connoisseur Jack. It is perhaps in these instances, actors like Jack Nicholson justify every penny of their enormous salaries. There are actors and then there are geniuses. The film also runs at unbearably slow pace for a road movie and the dialogue whist witty never raises more than a smile. The main problem, however, is that the film feels derivative, revisiting the same themes such as midlife crisis, depression, age, reminiscence, which was explored not Justin About Schmidt but also in other and better films such as American Beauty and City Slickers. A poor vintage from a talented director.",Sideways
489,stephenwillyamz-1,Miles Of Searching For Gilbert's Grape,8,22 February 2005,"Saturday night at the movies...Coastal California wine snobs, is a pretty funny subject that hasn't been broached as yet in motion pictures (as far as I know). Miles, Jack and company seemed to go through every silly wine connoisseur ritual in the book, ""I smell a hint of French Oak,"" (or maybe it was Belgian Oak he was really smelling). I'm surprised Miles didn't say, ""You must aerate the esters,"" while he expertly swirled wine around in his glass. Maybe the screenwriter was afraid he might lose his audience with a comment like that. I particularly liked the part where Miles compared his life to a certain fragile grape that required a lot of care. (I forget the grape in question.) Or how about that wine fountain splashing away, while some California fool, playing his acoustic guitar, gives the assembled wine tasting tourists, serene knowing looks. Haw-haw! And yet, through all this, something seemed very familiar about this picturesomething I couldn't quite put my finger on.Sunday morning dawned, and suddenly I knew where Sideways came from. Woody Allen! Sideways was a Woody Allen picture set in Southern California instead of New York City, with two non-Jewish principle actors. The little newbies writer that suffers from romantic angst (Woody), and his tall, good-looking; shallow actor friend (Tony Roberts) who seems to have the world on a string. Hey, if you got to copy, you may as well copy from the best. There was even a Diane Keatonish type named Maya for Woody (er, Miles) to generate awkward romantic blandishments toward and finally enter into a bittersweet relationship with. Her underachieving comment about getting a master's degree so she could work in a winery,got a great laugh in the cineplex. To some of the snooty citizens of Santa Barbara County, it probably wouldn't be so funny.Sideways had something that I'd never seen in a Woody Allen film before, but certainly exists in real life: Furious Women. Sandra Oh (the director's wife), became almost homicidal, while beating Jack in the face with her little white motorcycle helmet. Whenever Stephanie (Sandra) spoke I thought she was channeling Joan Baez. I wonder if that's her real voice or if she was just making a little auditory fun of a supposedly hip California woman with an out-of-wedlock kid and a marijuana habit? I enjoyed the film, not as much as The Aviator, but then maybe comparing one to the other is not unlike trying to compare apples with oranges. Or should I channel Miles and use a grape analogy?",Sideways

496,jimj409,"Superb, with a hint of tannins",10,21 August 2006,"I waited for this film to hit HBO, and I regret not seeing it earlier.I tend to watch movies while at the same time occupying myself with another pastime; I'm extremely easily bored, and usually I play a computer game simultaneously (a major reason, along with inability to smoke my cigarettes, that I rarely go to theaters anymore).However, with this film, I dropped my keyboard and let myself become swept up in the superb, note-perfect acting that played out before me within the context of a grippingly bittersweet and realistic story that unfurled against a spectacular backdrop.Giamatti as Miles was priceless; I will seek out his future films as they emerge. Not only does he have an exquisite talent for delivery of dialogue, but he has keyed into the facial expressioning that validate and elevate an actor's performance. When he sadly removes the roll of bills from his mother's Ajax can, when he calls himself a loser in the bathroom mirror, when he describes his excremental self-image underneath the bridge, he matches mood to dialogue to physical countenance in a manner that effortlessly convinces the viewer.Thomas Haden Church as Jack delivered a rich and satisfying performance as well; I found myself questioning whether he grew up as a San Diego surfer and thereby acquired his quintessential Californiaism, or if he really is as good an actor as he played out in this film. Just a fantastic turn, it was like eating cheesecake to listen to his dialogue (after every sip of wine: ""I thought it was pretty good!"") and watch his character live up to its rationalizations (""I told her I'm not available, and she knows I have to leave in a couple of days!"" (Yes, for his rehearsal dinner!)). Jack is the true aging and insatiable playboy, and the character he plays (as well as Giamatti's, of course) exists in real life. You may have a friend who shares many traits with Jack, and certainly you know someone like Giamatti's Miles... or you may see some of Miles in yourself. I know I did, although I never reach his depressed depths or feel as lost as he sometimes does.This movie probably doesn't appeal to folks who tend not to see the underside of aging, or refuse to, or simply choose not to due to their own ingrained optimistic viewpoints. It has its entertaining-for-entertainment-purposes scenes (Miles retrieving Jack's wallet from the fat waitress's husband after he was caught in flagrante delicto, for example) and the plot flows, but you must be enthralled with the patient, yet knowingly guided, character development for the film to fully appeal to you.Like a good wine, the movie requires some prior subject knowledge in order to fully enjoy it. The subject in this case is youth and age, the story is richly developed, and there are enough un-Hollywood pitfalls and deviations to make it a unique new piece of artwork worth your time.Along the way, you'll learn a lot about wine as well. Grab a good Pinot and sip this movie.",Sideways
497,miles-com2,romance movie for men,6,26 December 2004,"It seems to me that this is a romance movie for men. An new and interesting idea, I suppose. First of all, no woman would possibly wish either of these men to ""wind up"" with any of the movie's three women characters. Also, the male characters are developed whereas the female characters are the secondary characters.There seems to be some debate as to whether these two male characters, Miles and Jack, are ""normal"" ""real"" people. All I can say is I hope not. Stealing large-ish sums of money from old women and marrying people solely for their money do not seem like ""normal"" characteristics to me and I hope they are below the norm.The men do not grow very far within the movie  ""normal and real"", I suppose, but unjust within the context of movie morality, if you are going to subject these guys on women characters.My main problem with this movie is that (trying to avoid spoilers) some combination of these men ""end up"" with some combination of these women and I quake for the women.

499,LennyB,Great Movies Need Likable Characters,7,30 December 2004,"In everything I've seen written about Sideways, I haven't seen anyone refer to the fact that Paul Giamatti's Miles is so low as to steal money from his mother and then leave her drunk on the couch.Once I saw this scene, which was pretty early in the movie, I couldn't join Myles on his path of discovery. He was just a pathetic loser who didn't rise much above his indiscretions by the time the movie ended. Importantly, he lacked the likable qualities that make for a ""loser"" who is capable of capturing an audience and carrying a film. Church's Jack was far more funny, interesting, unoffensive, and certainly quotable. I had thought I had heard every conceivable term for a BJ until Jack told Miles that he needed to get his ""bone smooched."" But, bone smooching aside, the two characters who ""discovered themselves"" in Sideways were for the most part losers. I just wish that they were losers to whom I could feel more empathy. Maybe I'm not up on my wine tasting as I should be but I could not connect to Miles at all. Jack was certainly the character to whom I could better relate and cheer (Hey, he nailed two chicks the week before his wedding).All in all, some fun situations and some fine acting (to me, Church and Oh were the outstanding performances). I just question how this is winding up atop of so many ""Best of"" lists for 2004.",Sideways
500,noontide35,"""Sideways""the spectator of one's own life",8,18 February 2005,"Somewhere in his lackluster life, Miles' obsession with wine crossed the line from a connoisseur's passion into pure fetish. The conversation with Maya that night at Stephanie's house is pivotal and revealing. As he explained his affection of pinots, it became clear that to him, pinots is his projection of himself in the society, where he sinks lower and lower with every blow of frustration and indignity of reality day in and day out, all the while clinching to the beauty and meaning of life, to him wine and literature, like the last straw. It follows naturally that he snapped after getting the bad news from the publisher. That part of movie, though brief and predictable, is well done: full of tension but not over the top. By comparison, at the end he washed down the wine he's been saving for years (forgot what it is exactly) with burger and fries is too symbolic it falls in cliché. The tragedy of Miles is, he's a man with mediocre talent and way too much dignity in comparison. He spent his whole life writing a novel, essentially he wrote his whole life into the novel. Sadly, the novel, while no doubt beautiful and touching, is ultimately not enough to justify his whole existence. Jack tried to comfort him by saying, ""so what they rejected you? Just write another one, with your talent, I'm sure you'll get published eventually."" But to Miles that's like a dead blow, cause there is no other ones, this IS the one, the one that Miles defined himself by, the one that allowed him to call himself a ""writer"", as opposed to a middle school English teacher who stole from his mother at the age of 40. And Jack, while initially came off as a swinger with a simpler thus stronger form of existence, actually have the same problem. He ""had to"" sleep with that waitress, the one near the end of the movie, not Stephanie, ""it's something you don't understand"", he told Miles. As an actor who's way past his prime, if a TV series can be called his prime cause that's all he had to show for, rewarding random female fans with promiscuous sex is what made his life worthwhile, a duty he ""had to"" perform in exchange for the credibility to call himself a ""star"". The movie is called ""sideway"", maybe in part to indicate the fact the characters are mere spectator of their lives, who kept their head in their respective pipedreams while dragging on their everyday duties with their exhausted body. It's a very nice touch when towards the end of movie a brief scene showed Miles sat listlessly in a classroom while a student read with a monotonous voice. All through the movie we see Miles as a agonized novelist, but the classroom scene was actually what Miles do everyday in his life, that was what really defined him, it was shown in the end of the movie as a reminder, as a reality check. Just like after a beautiful speech by Maya, just when you think something is gonna happen, the tension for romance that had been building up ever since Maya first showed up was about to be released, the tension was already exhausted, and Miles went into the bathroom sprinkling cold water on his face and cursed out the pretentiousness. Little touches like this are what makes this movie good. Speaking of which, Maya's speech about the reason she loves wine can serve as a perfect footnote to the ""spectator"" conception. The part she said how she imagined the life of grapes, under sunlight and rain, is very touching. Then she went on to say how she thought every bottle of wine is a living entity, how they live their lives ripening and waiting for the moment to be drunk. But wines are not living things, the fact a bottle of wine tastes differently one day from another is an inevitable consequence of chemical reaction, there's no objective purpose here. Spinoza said, the fundamental error of philosophy is to project human purpose and meaning onto the inevitable law of nature (his definition of God). Maya here, is speaking of not so much wine as her version of perfect life, how she saw herself going through life with purpose and dignity, aging with tranquility and grace, when she was on the verge of going into mid life as a divorced woman.",Sideways

508,YuunofYork,A tale of two losers,10,11 December 2016,"Sideways is a thoughtful, studied, and dryly comic look at two very different kinds of losers. Miles (Giamatti) and Jack (Church), are both approaching middle age with too little to show for it, so they embark on a week-long excursion touring vineyards in Santa Inez, Solvang, and surroundings in lieu of a traditional stag party. Jack, undiscerning, immature, and soon to be married, is still coasting on his waning fame as a television doctor from twenty years ago, while Miles, cynical introvert depressive living down a difficult divorce two years on, awaits the last possible rejection of his unpublished tome of a novel. Surely such polar opposites must really love each other to remain friends this long? Not exactly. You get the sense they are each merely the last best option standing within the social isolation / detritus of their lives. Consequently, the trip they had intended to reaffirm their brotherhood devolves quickly; Miles is just there to get drunk on wine he can't otherwise afford on a middle-school teacher's salary, and Jack's burning urgency is to get laid one or ten last times - at least so they say. Reality is more bittersweet; Jack fears for his freedom while Miles retreats into a pretend world where he's still visiting this beautiful country with his ex-wife. There's a lot to chew on here.And it is beautiful country. The film employs real vineyards, often keeping their real name, interior design, and occasionally staff, as vibrant background. But rest assured, wine tasting is just table dressing here - Sideways is as much about California wine country as Chocolat is about confections. Miles' encyclopedic appreciation for wine is a cover for his depression-fueled alcoholism, while Jack has no interest in the virgin grape beyond the women pouring it. Maya (Madsen), fellow wine nerd, and Stephanie (Oh), pot-smoking single mother, match the men's personalities, but not their failures. They may not be where they want to be in life, but at least they face it with a certain maturity and without lying about their situations. As much as Sideways is a film about mid-life crises (male menopause if you will), it is a film about lying. Miles and Jack are lying to each other, to the women they pick up, and ultimately to themselves from very nearly the first line of dialogue. By the third act things have come to a head, as expected, with no way out but through. In fact, Jack frequently posits great ideas to turn their lives around, but both men are too self-destructive to follow them up.Other aspects of the film match the content. The score is ambient, but not intruding. The editing is occasionally flashy, but never at the expense of plot or dialogue, the camera-work is what cinema verite would look like if the camera were always mounted. Nothing in excess seems to be the motto, and it's a good one considering the introspective quality of the story. Where the closest you get to action is pudgy middle-aged men briskly walking around a driveway, the humor is dry as a domestic syrah, we always know our destination and there are no tears when we get there, then why not let the thing alone to speak for itself? That's what Alexander Payne did and we should be grateful.Sideways is a slice-of-life film, necessarily starting and ending without too much success or failure. It is expected and a bit precarious, but so is real life. It is the film's open-ended nature that makes its bleakness bearable.10 / 10, by turns darkly funny and sad-making",Sideways

510,jeffislouie,"Meh.... Not bad, but definitely not great...",4,18 December 2006,"So after hearing all the hype and growing to enjoy Paul Giamatti's work, I decided to watch Sideways, hoping that it would be everything the Oscar buzz made it out to be. I enjoy wine, but I really don't care enough about it to be entertained by the often silly and nonsensical descriptors assigned to it. In this movie, we get to hear all kinds of silly words for flavor - buttery, oak-y, tight, robust, deep, mellow, blah blah blah. If you aren't a wine weirdo, this gets a bit tiresome. And not simply because it is pretentious nonsense, but because it is so frequent and integral to the dialogue that it can be a turn off. It seems to me that there is a wave of movies coming out that are called brilliant where nothing seems to really happen and the plot is tragically motionless. We join not so lovable, rather pathetic Miles as he picks up the piggish, irresponsible and immature Jack for a bachelors week. Jack is a jerk who is way too into chasing tail for a man about to get married and Miles is a caricature of the lovable loser minus the lovable, with extra loser on the side. Miles and Jack stop by Miles' mothers house to wish her a happy birthday, where they eat her food and drink her booze, then, after Miles steals a few hundred bucks out of her drawer, they leave her asleep on the couch. These two dorks go to wine country with two different goals - Miles wants to wallow in self-pity and spend a week with Jack, and Jack wants to chase tail and get laid. Oh the fun that follows! Basically, Jack screws a gullible waitress and Miles blows his chances with a woman that is actually attracted to him. Why is she genuinely attracted to Miles? WHY NOT! Here is a loser who hates himself, travels to wine country frequently to drink alone, is always morose looking, carries prescriptions to several anti-depressants (which apparently work very well with wine), has no money, and can't manage to get his books published. Add to that the fact that he is fat AND balding? It's no wonder that a beautiful blond would be interested! Jack gets found out, they leave, Jack continues to be a self-obsessed moron and Miles continues to drink alone, sneaking wine into a fast food restaurant. What genius! Listen, I hate poo-pooing on movies that so many people seem captivated by, but personally I'd rather not spend my money watching movies this boring. This is a great movie for those days when you just can't sleep or need something to watch during commercials for other, more interesting television programs like 'yan can cook' or 'cspan'. Was the acting good? presumably- unless of course Giamatti really is a loser and Church is a self obsessed jerkwad. Was it a compelling story? Not really. I could have skipped this one and gotten something better. I recommend you do exactly that. Wait for this one to be on tbs.",Sideways
511,ethanmillerman,Great film....great wine!!,9,28 April 2006,"Sideways Who doesn't love a film about good wine and even more interesting relationships. If you haven't seen this film yet...you must go rent it now....and pick up a bottle of wine to enjoy while you watch. It's so refreshing to just watch real people living their lives and having real conversations with each other. The acting was superb and very truthful. This film is about relationships, enjoying life and good wine. If you don't know much about wine you might learn a bit from this film...it makes me want to drive through wine country and go tasting. Each of the main characters goes through a major change and as we follow them on their journey....we care more and more about their lives. This film made me think about life and all the directions we sometimes have to go. Isn't a good film just like a good relationship...we want to learn, laugh, and not feel like we are wasting our time. This movie gets my vote of a 9 out of 10.",Sideways
512,J_holden_Hume,"Hysterical, emotionally charged and wine soaked.",10,4 October 2004,"Alexander Payne's new film is an inspired adaptation of the novel by Rex Pickett. Payne always manages to capture those moments that make you cringe with understanding and regret, while at the same time laugh at the irony of real life and real situations. Paul Giamatti is wonderful as the tortured Miles and brings a depth and humanity to the picture which is often associated with the work of the Nebraskan born director. It is clear that he favorers character and locations over all else, and this is a refreshing change form the average studio pick where character takes a backseat to plot. In Sideways we see the strife of an average sole tiring to find a place in a world he no longer fits into.The film is brutally hysterical, hard to watch at times and a true testament to what is innate in all of us; vulnerably, and temptation. The move does have a few lagging moments. However, these small flaws are not enough to overshadow this beautiful and heartfelt story of the real human experience. Mr. Payne and his brilliant production team should be very proud of this film, and coming form one Nebraskan to another thanks for being an inspiration to all the inspiring film makers form the forgotten mid-west. Don't Miss Sideways, a journey through the world of wine and life, wrapped in a shell of the human nature, and true friendship.",Sideways

Really well observed, nice unpretentious poetry. Really felt for all the characters and laughed out loud quite a few times.Well-structured with gentle but significant twists coming when they need to as the power alternates between the two main guys. Waited three years to see this and was very pleasantly surprised.The photography is not stunning but the locations are really visual so it doesn't matter too much. The camera is always doing what it needs to be doing with some elegance. The director also made the Jack Nicholson film About Schmidt which was OK but left me a bit cold but with Sideways his mojo is working full on.",Sideways
514,pjonsson,Gets better the more you watch it. (Possible Spoilers),9,18 December 2006,"Have seen this film three times now, the first time I was a little confused by it (comedy, black comedy, drama mix?) and had little time or sympathy for the characters. The second time I started to realise some of the reasons for one of the characters actions and then had more sympathy for that character - which helped. The third time I saw the film I started to enjoy it more - to relish the scenes that I think will make this a somewhat timeless classic, and to discover more that I hadn't noticed before. I don't think that this film will date much - the themes are fairly universal (friendship, honesty - or the lack of, self-deceit, ego, chasing the opposite sex etc). In fact I think it will date well because of this. On a further note, I think part of the humour is the unlikely combination these friends present and the way they irritate each other at times. Yet through it all their friendship remains which gives the film a warm upbeat feeling.",Sideways
515,alexcs-1,A pleasant surprise,9,7 February 2005,"I initially went into this film not know exactly what to expect, but probably a quaint indie job. The first few opening shots almost convinced me of this, and there was a steady, enveloping depression over the first 20 or so minutes.Once the film begins to unravel its story and emotion, you start to become more receptive of what is happening. What is happening is a seriously awesome piece of cinema that transcends Lost in Translation or any of the other indie movies this thing has been compared to. This movie trades their empty/overdone style for actual storyline. Anyone not paying a huge amount of attention may miss this. There is a sincere aura about this film that I haven't seen for a long time. Even compared to About Schmidt and Election, this film is, just quietly, unbelievably good.True, there is a lot of depressed giamatti in there, and at times pieces of that can grate, but its worth it for the 2 or 3 times in the film where this pays off in watching him rip his heart out emotionally.This movie isn't for everyone. I would hazard a guess and say your level of enjoyment will revolve around your state of mind, and whatever else is going on in your life. Some people will just not be able to identify with giamatti, and that is probably a blessing in disguise, but for those who can, i think you'll find this film to be, as title, a very pleasant surprise.enjoy!",Sideways
516,willcanfly,"A Film With Depth, Good Performances, Honesty And Wine",9,26 March 2008,"I went into watching Sideways on my DVD with mixed expectations, wary of the fact i knew nothing of wine or even central California. But i was knocked off my feet by the quality and pure depth this film produced. With a fantastic performance from Paul Giamatti and no poor one from any of the cast, it truly brought the picture to life. Two friends away for a week; one a middle school teacher with a passion for literature and wine, and the other a air-headed actor who does voice over adverts on the T.V. brought comedy and interested events into the movie. I went away from this film with a smile on my face, knowing that things will be OK for the Paul Giamatti's character and his dream of a published book will never die. I take my hat off to sideways. It was truly fantastic, it was warm, full and well set. Thank You",Sideways
517,standstraight80,A film that lingers like fine wine.,10,28 May 2008,"Like the wine ubiquitously present throughout, allows its own story to breathe and take its lovely, wistful taste as we follow the two main characters played by Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church in their ""weekend of debauchery."" One couldn't imagine two more mismatched people -- Giamatti plays an intellectual introvert while Haden Church plays an irresponsible goon still trapped in high school -- but one senses that these have been friends for a long time, even if their friendship is held on a tenuous string. But friends they are, and it's described in this trip that begins in Southern California as they drive up the coast and enter wine country, where they meet two women, Virginia Madsen and Sandra Oh, equally different, both a complement to the men and with whom the men pair up with. The fact that the Madsen/Giamatti pairing is tentative while the Oh/Haden Church pairing is essential to the back story of wine: where the latter display their affair ""all over the place, commonly"" like Cabernet, the former is defined closer to Pinot, and in one heartbreaking scene, both Giamatti and Madsen define their characters through the evolution of wine throughout the years.And it's this one scene that makes the movie. Madsen conveys so much more with so little and should have been more than an Oscar nominee: her short scene lingers far beyond her last appearance in the movie, and makes us want for more of her soulfulness. She is able to bring out the less seen, more fragile side of Giamatti's character and have him take the decision he takes at the end of the movie, and the fact that Payne does not take us into that scene is indicative of that power their tentative yet intense coupling has seared into our minds: this is romantic eroticism at its finest, lasting equally much longer than the more torrid affair Haden Church and Oh exhibit. There is no need to see that final scene, because as private as it is, we know that they will consummate their union beautifully and move on into the future since they are perfect for each other.Beautiful, saturated colors and light that evokes films of the 70s, long takes, edgy humor mixed with touching introspection, SIDEWAYS is a visual treat that gets better with subsequent viewings",Sideways
518,minnyca,Well written film with excellent acting from its cast!,9,5 December 2008,"This movie seems to get mixed reviews, perhaps due to the diversity of people of movie goers in general? Not sure on that one.I for one overall liked this movie. Writing terrific - acting also particularly Paul Giamati and Virginia Madsen. Haydn Church is very good also the down and out actor trying to get his life together.Giamati as Miles is this down and out wannabee writer who is stuck in a time warp, his life is boring as an English teacher. He is the dog still licking his wounds, having never recovered from his divorce and his ""feelings"" for his ex-wife. He is at the beginning of this movie the loser or so its seems.As Miles and his buddy Jack played by Haydn Church travel around California's wine country the week before Jack's impending marriage, we discover that it is his friend that is the real loser in this story.As they travel about they meet two interesting women Maya excellently played by Virginia Madsen, a divorced waitress with a great knowledge of wine that Miles in fact has known for years, and Stephanie played by Sandra Oh whose character very quickly is physically attracted to Jack.The story develops and boils to a head when both women discover that Jack has been lying - that he in fact is getting married ...The story culminates with Maya's message to Miles as she accepts the fact that he did not intend to deceive her and that she has read his book and urges him not to give up. The ending lands Miles having the courage to seek out Maya in pursuit of his feelings and interests in this woman. What happens is left to the imagination - better to conceal than reveal ...Film is very good though perhaps in my mind is a little long - great shots of California wine country and great performances by Giamati as the lovable loser and Madsen as the interesting Maya. Disagree with some however it is easy to see how these two are attracted to each other. One they have known each other casually for years - also both are from broken marriages and can understand the heartbreak that can result and both have an avid interest in wine. Madsen in my opinion is one of Hollywood's best actresses - she was stunning in the 1980s - and certainly equally so now - she is absolutely radiant - from within and without. Giamati is great as the down and out guy trying to make something of his life.Even Jack in the end has the sense to marry the woman he intended to - great fight scene though with Sandra Oh. Haydn Church is good in this movie.Good film overall but maybe a little long.",Sideways
519,msmary,Enjoy Film with Fine Wine,9,26 May 2009,"Good wine can enhance the enjoyment and nuance of other fine things - cheeses, steaks, conversation, and this movie. Sideways is a smart comedy about two middle-aged men and their shenanigans in wine country that they should have outgrown years ago. Miles, the protagonist, is divorced and depressed but hopes to give Jack a sophisticated entrée into married life through a week-long wine tour through Napa Valley. Jack, meanwhile, has a more perfidious motive for the trip: to get laid one more time before he gets married.Like good wine, the film has rich ingredients that ferment together for a sum that is better than its parts. Paul Giamatti plays a superb narcissist in Miles, who bemoans the loss of his marriage and his failure to succeed as a published author. Thomas Hayden Church brings a self-deceitful charm to Jack that is both believable and humorous. And, if there has ever been a score that contributed so much to the mood of a movie, it's the one Rolfe Kent provided for Sideways.It's a film with both overt and subtle humor, overt and subtle drama. There are qualities to both characters the audience will find despicable. Director Alexander Payne makes a compelling effort to humanize the characters, but some audience members may find their actions unredeemable nevertheless. It's a movie best savored amongst friends and can generate some interesting post-credit discussion.",Sideways
520,myurkus,not great,4,9 February 2005,"Probably most people will, like me, see this movie because of all the Oscar hype. I was looking forward to it because it would be great to see a new and interesting film after a very cookie-cutter year, in my opinion. I wound up being disappointed, not because this was a bad movie, but because it wasn't particularly good.I wont spoil anything, but the promising premise of a last week before marriage for two friends had potential. I quickly found myself wondering why the two main characters were friends, their relationship did not seem plausible to me. They were incompatible and didn't seem to care much about one another. The problem with Miles, while well portrayed by Giamatti, was that I didn't really care for him. I was frustrated with him, and didn't find myself pulling for him.The acting was good, but the story was slow, and to me depressing. Hearing Miles spout on about wine made me want him to get a life, and perplexed me as to why a long lost Virginia Madsen would have any interest in him.Maybe it is just me, but just because a story is a little different and has the ""independent"" label shouldn't automatically garner it heaps of awards. If this is the best pic of 04, let us pray for 05. Save it for a rental on a quiet Wednesday night.",Sideways
521,dronhak,Touching portrait of middle life crisis,10,7 November 2005,"I envy some of the reviewers who gave ""Sideways"" low rating. This is because either:1.They are too young full of hopes and dreams, denying any connection with these two pathetic losers in the film.2.They have not experienced ever any self destruction feelings or continuous frustration;3.They are too ""sophisticated"" or ""artistic"" to be attracted by this movie with its earthly ""common"" humor and the naive optimism.4. Their ""moral"" is so high, to be bothered with the ""bad"" behavior of the characters, overlooking the entire movie.I think most people experience middle life crisis,when one realizes that most of his life has gone without accomplishing anything worth mentioning,and that he is not special as he thought in early days, and that it is far too late to fix it.This is the ""Sober up"" time and it is heartbreaking. The scene of Miles sitting in a McDonald restaurant, alone eating a Mack meal, while drinking the expensive rare wine,which he kept so many years for the right occasion, with a plastic cup, always brings tears to my eyes.""Sideways"" handle this subject with care, love, understanding, fun and with a glimpse of hope, and that is more than enough for me.",Sideways
522,prosinger,Can't Believe the Hype - No Way!,2,24 April 2005,"I just can't believe this movie rated an 8 out of 10 by viewers. I don't have the time to read all the comments and find those few who agree with my opinion (as do some, judging by some message board comments), but this movie was simply not enjoyable at all.There are some people who seem to be saying ""if you don't like this movie, you don't like good films."" I find that type of comment not only naive but rather insulting.I realize my own personal tastes are not often those of the public at large; I have seen and sought out many foreign films, tend to avoid Hollywood blockbusters with big stars and bigger explosions, often enjoy movies that are hard to classify in one particular genre, and very often prefer less well-known actors following through on plots that have interesting complications, that make obscure references, that make you think a little, and/or whose characters land in bizarre situations, forcing you to laugh despite yourself.All of which, one would think, would amply prepare me for Sideways.But I can honestly say, I was in a room of 5 people of varying ages, tastes, and even sobriety levels, and not one of us enjoyed this movie.The characters were admirably pitiable, the situations nearly painful to watch, the development nearly non-existent, and every time we thought something would or should actually emerge in the plot - we were disappointed.We felt like something was supposed to happen, indeed, should have been right around the corner if we would only wait one more minute for it... but it just never did.Great, so if you like wine, you've finally got a movie that sufficiently praises the ""intellectual"" aspects of this Bacchanalian pastime.Other than that, this movie was not a comedy - we almost never laughed - and it hardly seemed to qualify as a drama, since almost nothing of any import happened and left us completely unsympathetic with the characters.The most we felt at the end of this movie was slight disgust for the one womanizing character, and faint pity for the ""anti-hero"". Even these vague emotions were tempered by our complete disinterest, generated by this movie's inability to actually go anywhere.Sorry to buck the trend, but I could not recommend this movie to anyone.",Sideways
523,steers,"Beautiful, brilliant and funny.",9,23 September 2004,"I must say that I did like About Schmidt, I didn't love it, but I liked it. We got to watch this movie in film class and Mr. Payne came in and talked about it. I found this movie more enjoyable than Schmidt, perhaps because it is a little less depressing and there is more of a comedic element. The plot is basic, two guys on a bachelor party in wine country, yet the character development and acting push it into the realm of excellence. Thomas Hayden Church is funny playing his usual jock type character that we see back in the day in Wings, but Paul Giamatti steals the show. His character is reminiscent of Harvey from American Splendor but more likable and slightly more normal. The filming is great, beautiful scenery on location, it really captures the Santa Barbara wine country. Overall a really funny well done movie that is a gem in the world of garbage out there today. The acting is phenomenal, I want to emphasize that again, when asked why he didn't pick any bigger stars he said that he auditioned some but he chose the ones who he felt better acted the parts, and it shows. The sound track is also superb, it fits the timing and feel of the movie. Go out and check this film out, it won't let you down.",Sideways

Beautifully photographed, well acted with an intelligent script and believable characters.The film has the feel of an independent, yet seems to have been put on general release in the UK and deservedly so. The film appears to have become popular by word of mouth and it played to a packed house when I went to see it. ""Sideways"" is mainly set in the California wine growing region north of Santa Barbara and effective use is made of this location. There is also a road movie element to this film (albeit on a small scale) which for me, adds to its appeal. The characterisation is excellent with the four principals turning in excellent performances - worthy of Oscar nominations if there was any sense in the Hollywood system.I'll be buying the DVD as soon as it comes out (and probably the soundtrack too).",Sideways

Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church are perfect as friends more in spite of than because of their commonalities. I loved this film so much I saw it the day it opened here, and one week later in California, when I liked it even better. This is a film that holds your interest from beginning to end, with hysterical, alternating with heart-tugging scenes. Sandra Oh and Virginia Madsen were wonderful, but this film is Paul Giamatti's, whose expressive face makes you feel the pain of his rejection as a writer, and the loss of his marriage two years earlier, which still haunts him. Thomas Haden Church, whom I hadn't seen since the television series, ""Wings"", was hilarious. Run, don't walk, to see this wonderful film before it disappears!",Sideways

He captures and expresses so much of my personal human experience and frailty in his portrayals. Especially in American Splendor and Sideways.Not everyone ""gets' Sideways, but it's very theatrically rich when examined closely. As a film student, I really appreciate the complexity of the movie, its style, editing, the screen writing, and on and on.... and the story itself is wonderful.

527,ricanwarrior,Swingers on ripple,3,22 November 2004,"It is hard not to notice the similarities between the principals in this film and that of Swingers. However in Swingers the main characters, Mike and Trent, were a much more likable duo and far more interesting dimensionally. The character of Mike evolves from doubt and self loathing to becoming more confident and in the end forgets his former love and moves on.In Sideways, Myles and Jack venture on what was to be a one week journey to the Wineries of Coastal California. Right at the onset of the film, you see Miles as someone who has a hard time telling the truth and Jack as someone who has a hard time accepting reality. Myles lies about his drive to Los Angeles to meet Jack, lies about his 'soon to be published book' and steals from his mother. During the course of the week, they meet up with Maya and Stephanie and lie to them about their intentions (Maya believes Jack about his plans to move to the Central Coast with her, and even Jack begins to believe his own lie while all along preparing for his marriage in a few days to his fiancé in LA). When the bubble bursts and the women find out that their stay is transitory, Stephanie delivers the beating of a lifetime to Jack. At this point you think that maybe the characters would evolve into an awakening but nothing changes. Even as one of the only funny moments in the film transpires, Jack is at best shedding crocodile tears while brewing up a story he can tell his bride as to what happened to his face. As wedding day approaches, it appears everything is A-OK and Jack gets what he wants (delivering a wink to Myles at the altar). Myles meanwhile learns his ex is not only married but pregnant which sends Myles over the edge, drinking his vintage 61 in a styrofoam cup at a cheap burger joint. It was hard to really feel any affection for any of the characters, even though the female roles were well written and Sandra Oh performed the scene where she confronts Jack with realism (you could feel her hurt). The principal characters never evolve or learn from their experiences. As good as a friend Myles is supposed to be to Jack, he cannot tell him the truth either. Overall I give the film 3 out of 10.",Sideways

I believe any movie is good or bad, deserving 1 or 10 stars. But what makes this movie good? All it really does is show us the fragile and intricate nature of human relationships in a way that rings true. Isn't this what all movies are supposed to do? I don't care what genre, all the memorable movies are really about this balance. In fact, don't we spend our entire conscious life considering and manipulating, strengthening and weakening, building and destroying this fragile balance? So why don't all movies achieve the balance? This commenter believes it is because of the very hard work that must go into conveying this balance in a manner that achieves verisimilitude. It requires total submergence into the tedious and the frustrating. They become almost a philosophy in themselves. And it's no fun (as hard work never is). The fact so many movies don't achieve what Sideways does can only be due to a lack of discipline. And this lack of discipline in somrhthing as high-profile as motion picture may even have a trickle-down effect that is poisoning our culture. I'm probably wrong about that.

We both thought that if you are involved with wine and Napa, Sonoma, etc. you may like this movie just for its pretentiousness about grapes and wine. While we both like wines and drink wines that we find agreeable, we found the movie tasteless.Drunkards driving drunk about the wine country was not that funny. Cheating on one's fiancée was not that funny. And a pathetic suicidal dork was not that funny either.After hearing all about Virginia Madsen, we were expecting her role to be extraordinary. Instead we discovered a bland girlfriend role in a bland movie. Sandra Oh's character was, in our opinion, much more interesting.The only scene we found to be in the ""hilarious"" category was the car wreck scene.

It's frustrating, because so much good work went into the movie, but when all the good work is added together, it doesn't make a good movie.The problem is that the book was dumbed down for the film. A book about two struggling winners and a loser has been turned into a movie about four totally pathetic puttzes. There is absolutely NO growth among any of these characters, and moments in the book that provide catharsis are in the movie played for cheap laughs.See the film if you must, but then read the book.

535,doublejake,These are people I didn't like spending time with,3,1 January 2006,"""Sideways"" is one of those movies that are technically well done, with good performances and tight editing, that in the end make one wonder, ""Why did anyone bother to make this movie?"" With the exception of Virginia Madsden's character, I found the characters to be one dimensional, unsympathetic, unlikeable, and thoroughly depressing people to spend a couple of hours with. Giamotti's depressive angst and Church's selfish randiness were interesting and amusing for, oh, about a minute and a half. After that, I just wanted them to go someplace else, get out of my life, and leave me alone. As the end credits rolled, I felt that I had not watched a two-hour movie. Instead, I felt like I had watched a 15 minute movie eight times. The movie made me realize I'm too old to waste my time with unpleasant people. I think I'm glad I saw it (rented it because of the hype, the critical reviews, and the award nominations) but I'm very thankful I'll never have to watch it again. Perhaps I just don't understand the subtleties involved, but I couldn't identify with anyone in the movie -- if I were to encounter any of these people in real life, I'd take pains to ensure our lives intersected as little as possible as seldom as possible.",Sideways

537,nfusionfs,sideways: which is exactly where this movie went,3,8 December 2005,"when i heard about this movie, i heard it was about wine, a documentary about wine. this movie is neither a documentary, nor is it about wine. its about 2 guys just living life, they haven't done much in their lives, and they decide to go on a trip for a week to play golf, drink wine, and meet girls.this movie fails to excite any emotion at all, my face was deadpan for nearly the entire duration of the movie. i kept waiting for something to happen... and nothing ever happened. the dialogue is just PAINFUL to listen to, while i was listening to miles and jack drone on about nothing, i was picturing in my head what i wanted them to say, i almost never do this to a movie; I'm no writter, but the dialogue was just really that bad.for supposedly being a movie about wine (?) we learn the following things about wine. miles hates merlot, miles likes pint, and if you swirl wine around, the aromas and flavors change. wow, allow me to extend a hand to our master sommelier. and there's nothing wrong with merlot, its a perfectly good wine.the characters are really one-dimensional, and there is little to no character development. miles started the movie miserable, and ended the movie miserable, his performance was fairly decent though. however jacks performance was mediocre, not to mention his character got real annoying real quick.in conclusion, why is the movie among the top 250? granted its towards the end, but it does NOT belong here. it should be around the middle in the spectrum of all movies ever made",Sideways
538,rwalker-2,"Exceptional Acting in an ""Anti-Buddy Movie"" Buddy Movie",10,18 May 2006,"The bad reviews on this site for ""Sideways"" seem almost willingly obtuse. One has to wonder if they unwittingly see unpleasant aspects of their own lives and personalities in the people on-screen...? Film, after all, isn't just a window into other people's lives; it is also a fun house mirror where, like it or not, people just like you and me are tested in some way. Bear in mind George Abbott's basic model of drama:-- Act I: Get your character(s) in a tree. -- Act II: Throw rocks at the character(s). -- Act III: Get the character(s) down.The title is ambiguous and rich with meaning, but the one that springs to mind for me is simply this: When storing wine for long periods of time (like Paul Giamatti's character hoarding that special bottle of 1961 Château Cheval Blanc), the bottle should be shelved on its side so the cork doesn't dry out. And of course, when you over-indulge, you end up-- Sideways.The plot outline is simple: Take one clinically-depressed divorcé writer (Paul Giamatti) with a dead-end job as an English professor and an unattractive drinking habit (is there anything more pathetic than a wine drunk?!). Add a slightly underemployed, very oversexed TV/commercial actor with matinée looks beginning to over-ripen (Thomas Haden Church) whose own wedding is a week away. Mix in a late-model Saab convertible heading to a guys' weekend up in the California Central Coast, a handy motel and a map to the area wineries. Add a deliciously ripe local waitress with a well-developed palate for wine and a fondness for the writer (Virginia Madsen). Season confidently with one spicy wine pourer/good-time gal (Sandra Oh). Add wine. Liberally. Heat up with sex, betrayals, breakdowns, epiphanies, a lethal motorcycle helmet, a lost wedding ring and-- oh yeah-- one Fat Naked Guy. Savor with a nice bottle of Pinot Noir.Yeah, the characters may not be likable, but they're real. The humor isn't laugh-out-loud hilarity; you watch it and chuckle at these poor foolish people and, in the back of your mind, you see just a little bit of yourself in their motivations, their weaknesses, their aspirations and their comeuppances.The movie is well-directed and well-edited from a subtle, wise screenplay, but it would not have worked without the extraordinary chemistry of its four main actors. Giamatti, Haden Church, Madsen and Oh never hit a false note. ""Sideways"" isn't ""Animal House""-- it strives for truth instead of belly laughs, and it delivers beautifully.",Sideways

It's only intermittently funny, the lead characters are utterly unsympathetic, the wine snobbery overdone and anyway entirely lacking in humour and the ending weak. Rather like the novel of one of the protagonists. The performances were sure footed and the script at least believable, for the most part, but what an utter waste of money, time and celluloid. I can only assume that there has been some ballot stuffing to raise this very average piece of work into the IMDb top 250.

The piece was written in Spain at the Alhambra, one of the original classical guitar acadamy's. Anyone know why it wasn't credited?I enjoyed this film but will be truly surprised if it wins all the awards it has been nominated for. Virginia Madsen deserves a nomination and seems to have been, at least for a Golden Globe. Her ""LONG GONE"" baseball role was my favorite film so far.

The two male characters were pathetic losers, and I felt nothing but pity for the all of the female characters who had the misfortune of getting sucked into their lives. a better ending would have been for the bride to learn what a jerk she was about to marry and call it all off. At least I'd be able to cheer on the way out.And on another note, I was nauseated by the pretentious comments about the wine (""Oh - I think I smell a little clove!"" ""Oh, you are so right!""

As the cliché goes, you forget you are watching a movie. Here, the characters are not people you revere or fantasize about (well maybe Sandra Oh's character, a little); they are people you know and often loathe, but fully understand. The simplest adjectives are the best for this film. It is intelligent, sad, funny, logical and very entertaining.The plot is straightforward enough: two buddies go on a bachelor party-ish tour through a portion of the California wine country. They meet women, there's much pathos, some extreme hilarity, and the viewer learns enough about wine to be inspired to learn even more. And yet the movie, at its core, is not really about any of this.I can't recommend this film enough and I will never order Merlot again.",Sideways
545,sterrenmaan,An Essay on Wine,10,7 September 2012,"""Can I ask you a personal question, Miles?"", Maya asks as she and Miles continue their double date outside: ""Why are you so in to Pinot?""Pinot? You mean... wine? Is that really what you want to look at? A conversation on wine, a film on wine, a comedy!, is that in any way interesting to me? Yes, it very much is, it appears to be one of the most intriguingly humane subjects a film's plot could portray itself around - leaving open space for the characters to portray, and comedy to expose. What follows after this personal question, is the most hopeful and intelligent moment in the film: the dialogue continues with an incredibly written self-reflection of Miles, the head character of the film, about the things he needs - not that what everybody needs, he does not talk about love - he talks about the ""constant care and attention"" the Pinot grape needs, how it can only grow in specific places, tucked away. He talks about how it can only ""coax into its fullest expression"" but the very specific grower, the nurturing, patient kind that ""really takes the time to understand Pinot's potential"". This Pinot grape must be the most depressed of its family, so committed to the rare few in society, and so unable to find them the rest of the time. Yet, Miles explains in the latter lines, as the small monologue takes a turn, it is not completely hopeless, for in its potential, it has pride: ""Then, I mean, oh its flavors, they're just the most haunting and brilliant and thrilling and subtle and... ancient on the planet."" All it needs is recognition, by only a selection of people, which dó exist.As it's Maya's turn to speak on wine, it appears to be a lively metaphor on its own too. ""I like to think about the life of wine"" she says, ""How it's a living thing, I like to think about what was going on the year the grapes were growing; how the sun was shining; if it rained."" This, in the voice of the Madsen, is already reassuring: this is interesting. Then, she explains both the bittersweetness of wine and the realism of wine as a theme in the movie: ""I like to think about all the people who tended and picked the grapes. And if it's an old wine, how many of them must be dead by now."" And then she explains how the wine theme in the film constantly follows the main theme, the process the characters go through, with purely simple words. The rest of the dialogue serves as the rest of this review. The excellent review for this movie is already inside it, in a better way I could ever could formulate. It speaks for itself, and I hope it will trigger you to see this movie. It made me wonder... ""That virtue only makes our Bliss below,/ And all our Knowledge is, ourselves to know."" That was pope, this is Payne: ""I like how wine continues to evolve, like if I opened a bottle of wine today it would taste different than if I'd opened it on any other day, because a bottle of wine is actually alive. And it's constantly evolving and gaining complexity. That is, until it peaks, like your '61. And then it begins its steady, inevitable decline.Hmm.And it tastes so f*king good.""",Sideways

But that's about it. When getting out you'll forget it immediately. To call it an overblown ad for the US wine industry would be exaggerated. Though .... (but it may be rude to ask what sponsor's contribution has been given to Fox). One guy a tickle too whiner, the other a tickle too innocently ""everybody's darling"". Even information on how to taste wine, how to distinguish grapes stays rather shallow. If the Oscar nomination for Thomas Haden Church alias Jack is a sign of how American males figure themselves today .... no wonder we Europeans fear them. At least it is convincingly portrayed that the guy believes all the nonsense he tells his one-night-stands. Don't let's start to weigh intellectual aspirations .... that would end in an exaggeration like the whole nomination business.So again: the film is pleasing.

Suffice it to say that this film is a complete joy. It's one of those rare breeds of film that combines emotionally complex and touching characters, a moving story, and a bunch of light-hearted laughs.It is a crime that Paul Giamatti wasn't nominated for the best actor Oscar. He gave a moving performance along with Virginia Madsen and Thomas Haden church (who were both nominated in supporting roles), but his was clearly the best.

After probably forty-five minutes of viewing, waiting all the while for the brilliance to shine, I realized my subjective truth: ""This is it...and it stinks..."" Truly, I kept waiting for the magic. Admittedly, the acting itself is not sub-standard. However, I didn't care about the characters. Even after some development, none of the characters evoked any concern on my part for their fates. Also, the movie's ultimate motive remained mysterious to me throughout. It's been called a comedy. It is not. There are some humorous scenes, but these few are largely dwarfed by the pathetic and morose vibe the rest of the production oozes.Why the hell did this film get so well-received? Watching it reminded me of the feeling I got while watching ""The Thin Red Line."" Obviously, the genres are entirely dissimilar, but the effect both films seem to have had on the ""serious, thoughtful movie appreciation crowd"" is nearly the same: hmm, thoughtful movie...unusual...different...aah! Must be a film of exquisite substance! Something only the elite, enlightened ""thoughtful movie"" movie-goers would understand and dutifully appreciate...Balderdash.Still, you're possibly curious. After all, this film is on the top 250 list of all time. Well, see for yourself. I give it three stars just because a one or two star rating seems a bit too scathing.

It would be easy to call this a buddy movie and whilst the pairing of Thomas Haden Church and Paul Giamatti is inspired casting, there's a deep comedic intelligence and quality of script that takes it way beyond the average buddy movie. It's a film you will want to watch over and each time you do you will laugh at something you missed from the previous viewing because much of the comedy is so subtle that you miss it first time round. Performances from Giamatti and Haden Church are nothing short of Oscar winning and just two of the reasons why I put this film in my list, of top 10 best films ever, there are many more, great support from Virginia Madsen and Sandra Oh and stunning locations but the movie deserves nothing short of the perfect 10.",Sideways

Out of the movies of 2004, Sideways, Collateral, and Before Sunset have all done that. This is not just a comedy, it is a romantic comedy and quite possibly the best romantic comedy since Manhattan, the last American masterpiece. I'm not sure if I can call Sideways a masterpiece, but it is very very close.

In some ways I got what I expected, but I was surprised to find that this movie was just a 'grown up' version of the movie ""Swingers"". Although ""Sideways"" has funny parts and is well written and directed it would be completely unfair for me to give it a rating higher than Swingers which is more original, faster paced and more humorous. In addition I am a firm believer that movie ratings are substantially inflated for newer releases (a recency bias, so to speak), so I refuse to give Sideways a higher rating than Swingers (and as Sideways stands right now an equal rating to ""Groundhog's Day"").Let me draw some parallels that I observed between swingers and Sideways:Swigers- Protagonist is a struggling Comedian who can't get over his break up (as his friend says ""its been 6 months!"") who is constantly depressed and seems to ruin any attempts at meeting women. Sideways- swap Writer in the place of Comedian and 2 years in the place of 6 months.Swingers- Protagonist's friend is an actor who is confident, good with the ladies, likes to tell lies (""I'm a producer"") and constantly coaching the protagonist on how to meet women. Sideways-Exactly the sameSwingers- In the beginning the friend is seen as a confident guy who can never lose, but in the end you feel sorry for his somewhat pathetic need for attention (culminating in the final scene where he thinks he is 'making eyes' at a women who is actually playing with her baby) Sideways- Same, just switch the making eyes debacle with taking home a fat girl, then crying about potentially losing his wife.Swingers- Protagonist turns out to be the one that ended his old relationship (by moving to L.A.), but can't get over the break-up and is horrified to learn that she is with someone new. Sideways- Same (ended the relationship by cheating)Swingers- Protagonist's friend hooks up a date with two girls out of town (Las Vegas). The friend 'scores' while the protagonist is awkward and screws things up (He even has to check his message to see if his ex has called). Sideways- Same, except they are in Los Olivos and the protagonist actually drunk dials his ex-wife.Swingers- Protagonist never gives new women a chance. When he compares them to his old girlfriend they just don't seem as good. In the end he realizes that he has underestimated some women who intelligent and more like him than he thought (Heather Graham recognizes the duck on his business card and feels similar about waiting 3 days to call him. She is studying to be an entertainment lawyer) Sideways- Same, He tells his friend that Maya doesn't like wine and is only a waitress- his ex-wife on the other hand had the finest palette he had ever seen. Later he learns that she has a 'sharp palette', likes to personify wine and grapes (just like him) and is getting a Masters in horticulture.Obviously there are many details that are different between these two movies, but the overall story and feel are nearly parallel. In some cases I felt like scenes and dialog had been entirely borrowed. I'm sure some of you won't agree, but this is just my opinion.",Sideways

The plot is awkward, lots of lose ends. Not very appealing really.To make matters worst, it seems that movies distributed on planes are R Minus meaning they edit the swear words out so sentences don't make sense.

I expected main characters that weren't two pointless stereotypes, at the very least. Or maybe, if it had to include an obscure passion, something less yuppie-ish than WINE TASTING (and endless boring discuss of). Or maybe a plot with more significance than how a few privileged middle-age white men don't feel fulfilled in their lives, oh boo hoo. Maybe it's just me, but if these characters existed in real life I certainly wouldn't hang out with them. This extends to all the supporting characters to produce zero (0) sympathy or empathy for anyone in the cast! Maybe if this film was actually funny that wouldn't be a problem, but, really, it isn't.The reason I give it a four is because there are a few creative and a few genuinely heartbreaking scenes. In particular, Miles getting drunk at the bar, stealing from his mother's stash, and meeting his remarried ex-wife were very well done scenes. Too bad the rest of the film is smothered in self-importance and bad, predictable writing. Just like the ending, I guess it goes to show how self-pity and whining can actually help some people out.

The story chronicles two men in mid-life -- one who is about to tie the knot and one who is still in post-divorce depression. Miles the divorcée and wine connoisseur takes buddy Jack on a road trip through California wine country as a send-off to bachelorhood. Miles' carefully crafted itinerary of one fine vintage after another is swiftly hijacked by Jack's womanizing need for some final sexual exploits before the wedding bells toll. The trip that results from these conflicting desires is full of the most funny situations back-to-back that I have seen in a long time. Besides the side-splitting humor, there is a lot of attention to detail in the development of each character and the pacing and camera work for some of the escapades. The four lead actors and actresses are not well-known yet give truly outstanding performances.

He was exactly the same when he was in the TV show, Wings, and when you see him in person, he talks and acts the same. Therefore, that is not ""acting"", it's just being himself.I prefer actors who are completely different in every role they play. That is what made Olivier great.

561,TigerDriver,YABF: What's there to like?,2,9 April 2005,"Yet another buddy flick--and a bad one at that.A third of the men I know in Berkeley are like Miles: paralyzingly neurotic, self-absorbed, sexually frustrated, and numbing bores on one or more subjects (PINOT! GLOBAL WARMING!). I know fewer Jacks, but he's just there to move the plot along, anyway. I use ""move along"" generously, because nothing much really happens--and what does happen is sophomorically predictable.There are a couple of chuckles here and there (e.g., the wallet recovery), but no real humor. You know you're in trouble when 15 seconds are devoted to Jack wind-porpoising his hand out the car window.I can only assume the popularity of this movie means that it's destined to become an anthem to the mid-life crises of Boomers: ""Easy Rider"" for psychotropically medicated losers, only this time there's a female driving the bike.There must be thousands of scripts with this theme lying around Hollywood, so if you like this movie...expect lots more of the same. I also wouldn't be surprised to see an enologist-as-hero flick coming soon to a theater near you.",Sideways
562,tommyman,Alexander Payne never disappoints,9,15 November 2005,"""Sideways"" is the kind of films that need multiple viewings to be appreciated. Just like the Coen brothers' ""Fargo"", the more times you spend with the film, the more enjoyable it becomes. I gotta admit that the first time I saw it, I thought it was overrated; you know, the Oscar nominations and stuff. But after seeing it for the third time, I feel like it deserves all the praises it has gotten. The film is darkly funny and the acting is top-notch. Paul Giamatti, after many years of illustrious but overlooked acting career, finally got the breakthrough he truly deserves; he will, no doubt, be wanted by many studios after this film. Thomas Harden Church also did a good job for his part; he made Jack role pretty unique. Although, it is interesting to see what George Clooney could have done with the part if he had been given this role he craved for. Virginia Madsen is very impressive too. She gave the best performance of the career and she still looks gorgeous for her age.All in all, the person that should be admired the most is Alxander Payne. After Citizen Ruth, he has never disappointed. He always has his own perspectives of life shown in his movies, the dark side of the human beings. He, like Cameron Crowe, is a genius. The two, however, couldn't be more different. While Crowe always looks at things in a naive and feel-good kind of way, Payne plays with the darker side of us.Sideways is definitely one of the best films in 2004.",Sideways

Girls, especially single mothers are too smart for that! Took a long time to develop the story and too many montages. It took almost the end of act 2 for Giamati and Gini to get together.

It's so refreshing to just watch real people living their lives and having real conversations with each other. The acting was superb and very truthful. This film is about relationships, enjoying life and good wine. If you don't know much about wine you might learn a bit from this film...it makes me want to drive through wine country and go tasting. Each of the main characters goes through a major change and as we follow them on their journey....we care more and more about their lives. This film made me think about relationships, love, going after what you want, and sometimes we need to go Sideways instead of always going forward.

It's also filled with such beautiful touches, subtle performances (particularly from Giamitti) as well as some very, very funny moments.I think the magic of this film lies within its simplicity. Things are so pared down that each new piece of information, each quirk of a character, each misplaced comment or mistake made is even more touching, funny or affecting to the audience.As a champion of the underdog, I found Giamitti's character very appealing from the outset but to discover that he is so much more than just a middle aged loser is so satisfying. The film brought tears to my eyes more than once...watching him fall in love with Maya as she explains why she really loves wine has to be one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen.Finally, it is so heartening to see a film of this kind and quality on general release. I loved it.",Sideways
571,vytas_,On the Road Again,9,23 January 2005,"This coming of middle-age buddy film, with its odd couple of old chums, is one of the most, language rich, character- driven films to come tooling down the 101 in a very long time.From the beginning, we are set up to dislike Miles {Paul Giamatti} and Jack {Thomas Haden Church}. Who among us can dredge up warm feelings for a man like Miles, who drops by his mom's house to surprise her for birthday, steals from her and, to add insult to larceny, leaves without even saying goodbye.Jack, looking to get layed one more time before his marriage, is a splendid companion to the morose wine connoisseur/alcoholic Miles as they romp down this road which has a few slapstick potholes but lots of lush dialog to keep our interest along the way. In the language of wine and the language of relationship - this film is filled with fresh images and an appreciation for ambiguity, juxtaposing the profligacy of Miles and Jack, each in his own way obsessive, with occasional quick scenes of workers in the fields and the subtle introduction of a child as witness.We can easily question what someone as articulate and beautiful as Maya {Virginia Madsen} could be expected find in the man Miles who, like the pinot noir grape he describes, is thin-skinned, temperamental, early ripening, and in need of constant care. Still, we know that he is a writer - albeit a bad one, given the title of his book - and Maya has been cast, as we discover in one metaphor rich sequence, as a poet of the vineyards. Thus, she might well be susceptible to succumbing to the longings of artistic expression and forgiving of the vagaries of the human heart. This is a clever film, ably written, cast, and performed.",Sideways

I'm not sure why I enjoyed the film, it kind of moved me as the lead characters displayed their utter reliance on each others friendship.I just wonder how many folks I could recommend it to without them coming back saying 'well that was a bore'! - not because it is a bore, but by todays mainstream movie standards, a simple life story like this doesn't seem to cut the mustard for some.Watch it and make up your own mind.",Sideways

Miles just wants to drink wine, play golf, and just have a relaxing time on the trip, while Jack just wants to get laid. Miles meets Maya (Virginia Madsen) and Jack meets Stephanie (Sandra Oh) and all four end up spending the week together.Sideways is a fantastic film for many reasons, especially the writing, directing, and acting.The screenplay: absolutely amazing. This is one of the best screenplays I've ever read. The adventure Miles and Jack go on is so well written, with every scene being hysterical or meaningful, or both. You immediately fall in love with these characters and want to find out where they're going to end up.The acting: Paul Giamatti give the performance of his career and one of the best I've seen. He completely embodies the character of Miles and is both funny and touching. Thomas Haden Church also gives the performance of his career and nearly steals the film. Virginia Madsen is truly elegant, giving an amazing performance as well. The directing: Alexander Payne is phenomenal. He truly understands human emotion and knows how to get the very best from his performers. Every scene is directed with incredible skill and poise.Bottom line: This film is a masterpiece. Its absolutely hilarious from beginning to end, truly moving, and masterfully told. The screenplay, directing, and acting combines to make one of the best movies I've ever seen.

579,coolcricket,"artifice, not art",3,28 November 2004,"On a superficial level this movie is a character study about grown ups reluctant to act their age. But this theme is very much a pretentious conceit. Many contrivances make the film's faux realism jarring to a viewer hoping for genuine emotional resonance. The praised writer-director seems to know nothing about Californians (or any single adult these days) or how they behave. Potential spoiler: For one thing, a woman who openly starts up a sexual relationship with a stranger would not go ballistic and brutally attack him when she learns that he was just working her to get laid. Her character is up to the same thing and would, at the most, just blow off the guy as worthless and never talk to him again. The severity of her attack is absurd, as is her character's supposed overnight attachment to him. Other egregious moments occur in the writing where characters have either an indifference to California law (no one can legally smoke in a bar, for example, and drinking and driving is extremely frowned upon throughout the state) or where their behavior is out of sync with what would happen in real life. There is a particular moment at the beginning of the film that sums up the script's laziness: the best man is summoned to the kitchen of a mansion to help select the cake for a wedding that will take place in a week. No marriage so formal and elegant would wait until the last minute to choose such a thing; those decisions are made months beforehand (this is pointed out by the bride's obsession with getting the rings just to her taste). Indeed, the whole basic plot is contrived: no man about to be betrothed to the member of an incredibly rich and protective family would be allowed to run off on a ""wine-tasting"" trip for a week only to arrive home in time for the rehearsal dinner. While I was hoping for intelligence or even a quirky slice of life, the plot and characters of this film ring untrue.",Sideways

To just label a film like this simply as one is almost to demean it's integrity. This is a film about life, about relationships, and about two guys going on a trip and what very well could happen when the cards are played right. This film is such a joy to watch because of its realism, you can't see this film without thinking about yourself or one or two of your friends in this very position. It's so realist in it' depictions of how a pessimist and his optimist yet not to swift at times friend can act. I couldn't see the film without thinking, ' this reminds me of the time my friend and I...' That's one of the bigger appeals about this film. The other great thing about it is the seemly flawless transitions through comedy and drama. Such is life, Laughter one minute and some sadness the next. And the ending has to be one of the best for a film of that realist of a nature, because much like real life it just goes on. Not happy nor sad, just changing, moving, transitioning.

Let me first just say that I think having no expectations or idea what this film is about is a great way to go. Payne allows the story and characters to unfold and does not rush this development; he wants it to occur naturally. Coming in to this film, I personally think that the less you know, the better. This film is visually beautiful having been filmed in Northern California's ""wine country"" and artistically different from most current movies. The performances from everyone, but especially the four main characters, were incredible, and I think that the fact that many people have not heard of them actually makes the film feel more real.

Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church are sensational together; they play their characters so well that you will actually grow to believe they're best friends. Payne almost had a terrific movie with About Schmidt, but it failed to generate much interest with me other than Jack Nicholson's great performance; Sideways is a complete film, an outstanding achievement where everything works.

585,drj7777,"Funniest movie since ""Something's Gotta Give""",10,25 December 2004,"I was apprehensive going to see Sideways; I usually know more about a movie before I spend the time to see it. This movie, however, was such a treat from beginning to end; sometimes uproariously funny; other times just amusing.Here is a movie with few recognizable stars; Virginia Madsen playing her best role since ""The Hot Spot"" with Don Johnson, and Paul Giamatti playing Miles, one of the co-stars (I recognized him from a Seinfeld episode years ago sans beard).Paul was flawless as a troubled 30-something who set out with his best friend Jack (played by Thomas Haden Church) on a week-long fling before Jack's wedding. Miles and Jack had different ideas of fun, however. Miles, a wine connoisseur, planned to visit every vineyard he could find in seven days. Jack wanted to get laid.One of the many funny moments was when they were at their first vineyard tasting wine, and Miles goes through an amazingly eloquent and detailed description of every taste he could find in the wine; including a tiny hint of cheese. Jack chugged the glass of wine and said he tasted some strawberry. ""It tastes okay to me,"" was Jack's critique of every wine he tasted throughout the movie. I won't spoil the final hilarious comment of that scene, but it made us laugh out loud.The girls, Maya and Stephanie, were equally entertaining and gave believable performances. Maya had a thing for Miles, but he couldn't grasp it until it was too late. Stephanie was out for a good time, so she was a great partner for Jack. The movie has it all; wonderfully mature humor (unlike the cheap humor you find in most Adam Sandler/Ben Stiller movies), disappointment, honesty, dishonesty, intrigue, drama (when Miles almost got killed rescuing Jack's wallet from a jealous husband), love, and a sweet if not predictable ending.The acting was universally wonderful, the writing as good as it gets, and as a result, my only disappointment was that the movie had to end.

One may be that I will never see a commemorative Sideways bottle of wine or the Sideways happy meal at McDonald's. My point is that Sideways is a great movie and nothing more. It doesn't rely on blockbuster star power. It doesn't need flashy special effects or gimmicks. Paul Giammatti performs flawlessly as a flawed and deeply troubled character. I found myself forgetting he was acting. I only saw the character he was playing and became engrossed by his presence. Thomas Haden Church offers a very nice contrast by playing what appears to be a two-dimensional, sophomoric, womanizer. The story is simple and focuses more on character development. It is easy to connect with each of the main characters. They may not be likable but what they are is human. If you can't relate to them personally, they remind you of a family member or close friend. Overall, this film is for those who like movies based in reality, which as you will see can produce some of the most bizarre and comical situations of all. If you like movies with jokes you don't have to think about (Who doesn't from time to time) don't worry, this film has a surprisingly high amount of low brow, immature, vulgar humor, mixed with the dry and subtle.

The characters are old roommates from college and have very different personalities. This movie attempts to explore the two characters while placing them in funny situations and scenes. Some of the scenes very funny scenes and for that it was worthwhile. My main difficulty with the movie was that the characters were both immature and depressing and didn't develop during the movie. This movie was all about the characters. Both characters had problems that were easy to relate to (I am about their age). However, both of them dealt with their problems as if they were still college freshman. This made both characters seem emotionally immature.

This was the most boring piece of c--p I could have imagined. The writing was self-indulgent and self-pitying, and I felt like life would make more sense as a lesbian when I left the movie. I certainly didn't want to be exposed to the ""inner workings"" of any more male psyches (characters' or writers'). And I didn't relate to any of the female fetishes--I mean characters--on screen (what a surprise). I guess I'm just not hip (or male) enough to ""get"" this movie. What I really think is that too much money in Hollywood and the Indie film industry goes to middle-aged, straight white men, and that this is what creates the dearth of mirroring for the rest of us out here (women, people of color, queer folk, etc.).

There is no delusion about love or romance. This is a rare occurrence in American films. Typically Americans make movies in which there is a clear distinction between the Bad and the Good, so that the delusional viewer gets out of the cinema dutifully charged with fresh illusions. Not this one! THis film cuts through the BS. It is made in European manner. It is a good story about people I wish I never meet in real life. The principal character, Miles, is the type of man that steps on your nerves if you were to meet him: haughty, snobbish, introvert and obsessive. A combination of pathetic and egocentric. Thus, Paul Giamatti acted well. He was uneasy, and at times, annoying. He reminded me of the awkward characters from classic Russian novels. The second principal male character is not more endearing, either. He is a different type of loser - the one who keeps up appearances. Some weak points: The story line is a bit predictable.

This movie has its funny moments but ultimately the characters are not likable or believable. That is unless, perhaps, you happen to be drinking a lot of wine while watching this movie. I can't understand why everyone is so excited about this movie. There haven't been any really good comedies lately, so perhaps this one stands as the best thing available. To me, it seemed like an ""American Pie"" for a different demographic. Instead of randy teens it is for unhappy, but randy adults who dislike the thought of marriage. In other words, not sophisticated cinema but rather an off-beat and admittedly unique utter waste of time.

Not so with ""Sideways"", I'm afraid.The characters, with the exception of ""Maya"", played by Virginia Madsen, are morally bankrupt, and uninteresting to boot. Paul Giamatti's ""Miles"" is a narcissistic, self-pitying bore, who most people would run from. Thomas Hayden Church's character is a bumptious eternally horny middle-aged dweeb, and Sanda Oh's character is a hedonist with nothing much going on upstairs. Only the character of Maya has anything resembling a moral backbone, and it's impossible to understand why she would spend more than five minutes with any of those other characters.It's also way too long, and in desperate need of a good editor. The ending was a manipulative effort to make the audience connect with the characters, and it was easy to resist.Go see Kinsey rather than this. After all, if you're interested in a movie about sexually and emotionally dysfunctional people, why not skip this mess and go to the source?",Sideways
592,mooseman01,Inner life of (a) man portrayed in two characters.,10,26 December 2004,"I have not read the book or reviews of it. We saw this film last night in LA. The log lines mainly and correctly tell the surface story, but diminish the vital roles of the women, whose characters become the necessary bonding for us. Ms. Madsen is outstanding in expressing the vulnerability of those surrounded by the terrors of neurosis. For me. it is a study of ""the one"" in many of us, living side by side: SIDEWAYS, certainly for this male, who is both of the men on the screen: as are ""both"" of the men on the screen. It is the conflict of anxieties within many of us. I think it is the single best depiction of inner-life I can recall. I am a recovering alcoholic but neither concerned nor put off by the use of so much wine and wine talk; indeed I found it easier to identify with and relate to all the characters, although I feel the ""alcohol"" was more symbol and facilitator than exposing the dreaded disability of Narcissistic Sensitivity. The portrayal of taking one's own life to the brink of total destruction driven by one's own inner demons triggers the very anxieties from which we run. This film omits nothing. It is all there to be absorbed.",Sideways
593,trc414,"""Swingers"" for older people",8,26 December 2004,"I keep hearing people say that Sideways is the BEST movie of 2004. I don't agree with that....but I'm not going to say this was a bad flick.As I started watching Sideways, I thought I was going to doze off. The first 30 minutes of this movie were REALLY boring. I understand the director was trying to set everything up but I couldn't get into it. Fortunately, it really picked up and I enjoyed it.I compare this movie to ""Swingers"" for older people. You have the hip, adventure-seeking Jack and the depressed and defeated Miles. Instead of going to Vegas (like in Swingers), the two head to Central California and find their own trouble.One other thing about this movie that bothered me was the appearance of the boom mic in at least three scenes. It temporarily affected my focus and looked extremely unprofessional.",Sideways
594,patangello,A Beautifully Articulated Film,10,21 January 2005,"This film is a story about a couple middle-aged men with strange relationship issues. Miles (Paul Giamatti) is a divorced struggling writer/English teacher with a passion for wine. When his buddy Jack (Thomas Haden Church  yes, the goofy mechanic from Wings) is about to get married, Miles plans a bachelor trip for them to tour wine country, eat some great food, and relax by playing a little golf. This is Miles' ideal vacation and getaway, but Jack basically just wants one more fling before he gets married.Ya know, I don't say this many times, but this is honestly one of the best movies I've ever seen. The plot I described above isn't anything too exciting, but the character development is fantastic and the dialogue is absolutely brilliant. Sure Jack throws f-bombs all over the place, but the talk of relationships and description of wine and how it's made literally floored me. I swear to you, when Miles goes into detail about why he admires a Pinot Noir, and the care put into developing that wine, I had tears in my eyes. It was so beautifully scripted and his performance made you feel like he drank it out of respect for whoever made the wine, and their passion for the craft was directed personally at Miles.I'll tell you right now, I know nothing about wine. I've tried some, but never really liked any of it. After this film, suddenly I want to learn everything about it! That's scary! No matter how many people have suggested wine to me, or told me how to drink it, I could care less  it was all the same. But the descriptions in this film aroused my curiosity, which I never thought would happen. That alone makes it an impressive film in my mind.The relationship between Miles and Jack, their flawed personalities that they never learn to overcome, keeps this film true. You really get to know both of them by the time its over, and you feel for them. Even if Jack is a pig, you understand him and you know why. You can pry into Miles' pain of being divorced and why he is scared to embark on a new relationship. They are great friends in a love/hate relationship.This is a very funny film if you can handle the language and brief sex scenes (Mom). Paul Giamatti is a brilliant actor, which reminds me to tell you to rent American Splendor. Go see this film  please! It's rated R so there won't be any loud kids there and I have not enjoyed a film this much since Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. I honestly can't find anything disappointing in this film!",Sideways
595,jangeli01,A great movie I couldn't ask for anything more.,10,10 April 2005,"I stand by what I've been saying for a long time when I say, Paul Giamatti deserved an Oscar for his performance in this movie. He gave the most outstanding performance, 2nd only to Brando's Godfather. He out did Jamie Foxx by a landslide and didn't even get nominated. I honestly believe that Paul Giamatti is the best living actor today. I also believe this movie was overshot at the Oscars, because it deserved best picture and best director. Even though Million Dollar Baby was a good movie, I strongly feel that Sideways was way more deserving. Overall I feel Sideways is one of the best movie ever made and it is definitely going on my top 10 list.",Sideways

It has every cinematic element a movie fan could want. It's funny, but any viewer can easily relate to the character played by Giamatti. He's trying to have a week of fun, trying to show his best friend a good time, but his life is headed in one direction at the beginning of the film, turned around in the middle of the film, but is back on the right track when you see him knock on Maya's door in the very last seconds of the film.

When Miles went to his mother's house he took several $100 bills from a canister hidden in a draw. My friends think that he was stealing his mother's money. My husband and I thought that it was money that he had hidden there and therefore was his money. Does anyone out there know what the writer or director intended? Any thoughts on this? Also if anyone knows how I could contact the writer or director to find out, please let me know. We thought it was a good movie, but our friends were turned off on it because of that scene in which they thought that he was stealing from his mother.Thanks, Suzanne",Sideways
598,jpl315,Luke-warm impression of Sideways,7,23 March 2005,"Sideways is a hit-and-miss proposition.It hits on some very central themes that we often encounter in life. At some point, probably a whole lot of us cross the bridges the movie's four characters cross.Unfortunately, the movie's ""miss"" is because its characters are too ""stock-off-the-shelf."" One is a clueless, alcoholic writer (a cliché character) who is to the point of almost being beyond help. One is clueless and locked in the playboy/girl-in-every-port character -- another cliché. One has a way-out-in-left-field persona. That's Cliché Character No. 3. The other character has a modicum of common sense and an even keel, yet she's got some issues, too. That's Cliché Character No. 4.This sort of movie has been made many times -- same cliché characters, same everything, right down to the ""let's have some fun and get laid"" before Big Event fare that drives many a plot. Only difference here is that Sideways' characters are middle-age, not college-age.Sideways features a couple of downright funny and sobering-serious moments that move the plot and lift it a notch or two above normal cinema fare, no question, but it's hard to respect any film as an Oscar nominee list with so many clichés stitched into linear plot movement. Shake up the clichés, lose some of the linear plot movement, and you've got something closer to an 8 or 9 on a scale of 1 to 10 and a whole lot less cringing, at least from Yours Truly.",Sideways
599,rpatrick100,Tries to be deep but just doesn't manage it,3,30 March 2005,"I'm not sure why this movie just didn't click with me. Maybe it was the wine tasting theme, possibly attempting to add a feeling of depth and knowingness when it really just came off as being pretentious. ""Ahhh, these people know wine-they must be smarter and more worldly and wiser than me"". Maybe it was the film's predictability. Or maybe it was because I saw it on a night flight from New York to Rome while wedged between an Italian man ranting about having to pay for a glass of wine and a flatulent oil boom salesman. Whatever the reason, it just didn't do it for me.I literally laughed out loud when Paul Giamatti's character, a little man as he was, would prattle on about how bad a particular wine was, as if he was insulted that someone would have the audacity to lay before him such swill. From that point on, nothing in this movie really mattered.As they say, 'Great men talk of accomplishments, good men talk of ideas, mediocre men talk about wine'.If you are wowed and envious of those who know a supposed good wine from supposed bad wine, you'll love it. If you live to slay pretentious fools, it will make you insane.",Sideways
600,bacchus144,Any Movie About Wine Can't Be Bad,9,4 May 2005,"Nor can any movie with Paul Giamatti in it. I'm not sure about the casting of T.H. Church and Sandra Oh as the bad-boy on a ""chick safari"" before his wedding and her as the conquest. There is a darkness in the screenplay that is both incongruous and yet unexplored. This was a novel first and I plan on reading it for further insight. The wine insights are great and the movie entertains. The dislike/distrust between Church and Giamatti might've been intentional but the failings of both characters mars what should be a buddy movie with a twist into hints of elements of despair in both characters alluded to but not explored. The hype might disappoint those who's expectations are elevated but this is a very good movie worthy of a night of discussion and a decent pinot noir.",Sideways
601,seansean2004,Ummmmm......what'd I miss?,3,5 May 2005,"SIDEWAYS is a critically acclaimed comedy that was supposed to be strong on character development and insightful about the human condition. It is neither! In fact, I would argue that the movie is not at all a comedy unless one considers THE DAYS OF WINE AND ROSES a laugh-fest! The plot is simple enough. Two friends take a road trip (destination....a motel in wine country!) before the one ties the knot and gets married. As their bachelor excursion progresses it is discovered that the main character played by Paul Giamatti is an amateur wine connoisseur and a brooding alcoholic and his buddy wants to sleep with anything that doesn't walk on four legs. Here arise the conflicts for which there is never any resolution. Both characters begin the movie with their crippling flaws.....and end the movie without an ounce of growth. Chemistry between the two is also sorely lacking. In fact, one wonders if they even really like one another. The acting is fine although not great. There is one exception: Thomas Hayden Church (from the television show WINGS) always seems to be acting as if he was a dumb airline mechanic.....demonstrating why it is never fair to type-cast an actor.I am looking forward to SIDEWAYS 2 where Church goes through a financially devastating divorce and a jaundiced Giamatti attends a court ordered rehab after his third DUI!",Sideways

His previous offering :About Schmidt was even more of a downer. Do thinking people really need this?

603,gerrym42,Stye Ways would have been a better title,2,30 May 2005,"We watched the DVD version of this film and were so disappointed after reading such good reviews. The two ""heroes"" behaved like pigs, endlessly eating and drinking and seducing the poor bitches who waited on tables to keep a roof over their heads.All films tell 2 stories, the plot plus a bit about the society that produced the film. One of the heroes is a full time English teacher at high school yet not only does he regard himself as a failure, he is so badly paid he steals from his widowed mother's savings which he locates in her draw of underwear. There is no implied criticism of this in the film. Worse, he is shown as repeatedly drinking and driving, driving after having drunk several bottles of wine. Once again this criminal activity receives the seal of approval - just a bit of lovable fun. People like this guy kill and maim other peoples loved ones, that's not lovable fun for those involved. These two aspects of the film depressed me.

He stands by and says nothing while his friend Jack completely uses Stephanie in order to have one last selfish fling before his marriage, and what's worse... leads her and her daughter on with talk of love and the future. Stephanie's not much better, encouraging her little girl to call this one-night stand loser ""uncle."" Finally, when she finds out about the deceit, she commits assault and battery. Nice! Later, after also lying to Jack about not having told Maya, Miles is the ""best man,"" someone who's supposed to stand up and support his friend in a sacred marriage commitment, full well knowing that he's screwed two women in the past week.

605,questortapes-1,Moving,10,7 July 2005,"I haven't always been a fan of Payne's work. I thought Election was wildly overrated and at times offensive but this was really a great little film.It may be hurt by overpowering expectations brought on by Academy Award nominations but it really is a strong work if approached on its own fair terms.The story itself is simple yet complex. Payne does a masterful job of creating a movie that feels like a novel (in a good way). It possesses an interesting richness and texture of character that doesn't often appear in American films.The performances were excellent. Giamatti is a gem of an actor who will hopefully find projects that exploit his considerable talents rather than relegate him to sidekick status. Madsen was good, a sturdy performer who held her own with the lead. The most impressive combination of actor and role was Thomas Hayden Church. Kudos to Payne for casting him in a role that seems right on for the actor and kudos to Church for selflessly trusting Payne's judgement.If you enjoy literature and savor performance and behavior, I recommend this film to you.",Sideways

607,divinams,A waste of time,1,15 January 2006,"I had high hopes for this movie, having been intrigued by the trailer and being a fan of unconventional scripts that do not follow the common Hollywood blueprints. This movie had several major drawbacks however, ones with enough impact to justify the very poor rating I gave it.The characters were flat and unevolved; at no point are the viewers provided with sufficient information to justify or even understand their erratic behaviors. I will not go as far as some and label them as immoral, they are simply human. Dislikable, but indeed human. What is their story though? Why do they act as they do? What circumstance led to this development of increasingly unpalatable behavior? We never get to find out, especially in the case of Jack. Consequently, we, the viewers, are left with only a bad taste in our mouth, unable to ever sympathize or identify with them. The secondary characters are equally underdeveloped, serving no real purpose but to leave you wondering why they are there...They too are but shadows, tools to further the plot a baby step ahead. We receive no information about their life story, and are left completely baffled about why such people would eagerly socialize and develop any sort of emotions (whether it be friendship, love, concern, lust or whatever positive feeling one might like to replace the above with)for the two main characters - very unsatisfactory.There was a bit of buzz about the unique camera-work and presentation of this movie as well as it was coming out.. Namely the use of two images at the same time and the distinct 70's style... I cannot warrant the former with even a slight nod of respect, it happens only once in the whole movie, and makes absolutely no sense. Was it supposed to be some unique 'feature'? Please. It did not bother me, but not only was it not unique and original, it was pointless as well. As for the 70s style, it is something I enjoy and it did give some extra 'color' to the movie, but once again, it served absolutely no purpose. Just an inconsequential feature. The photography is poor and not pleasing to the eye either. The scenery was dry and unmoving, but perhaps that was a conscious choice of the director. It lends itself to painting the lives of these men in an even more pitiful and pathetic color. I get the feeling that the movie would have been entirely different if it was shot in a tasteful, picturesque area, like French winecountry instead.In the end what bothers me most about this movie is that after having watched it I do not feel like I have gained anything. I do not feel my mind broadened. I do not feel like the movie made me think. I did not glean the slightest bit of information, knowledge, wisdom from it. Nor was I moved, made to feel anything..from sadness to joy, from sympathy to anger and detest...the movie left me cold, not having experienced any emotion. This movie did not tease my mind, titillate, provoke, cause me to think or stimulate me. It left me with nothing. How very selfish.",Sideways

610,hayleybear100,Enjoyable,7,11 March 2006,"To begin with I found this film a struggle to watch. Nothing seemed to be happening, just a clichéd couple of guys going on a road trip across Californias wine tasting country (which looked absolutely beautiful). Neither of the characters endured themselves to me, one scene showed Miles visiting his mother, who could not do enough for him, and stealing her money. The other main character, Jack, for whom this trip was meant to be his 'stag week' made it clear he was going to sleep with as many women as he could before he got married the following week.But, as the film and characters developed, I found myself drawn into to the story, and started to enjoy it. I wanted Miles to get his book published and get with the lovely Maya, and I really felt for him as he struggled with letting himself go and revealing to Maya how he felt. The other character, Jack, I found harder to empathise with. He showed no respect for his fiancé and certainly behaved despicable towards Shelly, making her believe he loved her and wanted to be with her and her young daughter. In the end I just felt sorry for him as he is reduced to a naked weeping wreck, terrified of losing his future wife.Marketed as a comedy, I wouldn't say that is the films strong point. It did hold a few laughs, but it is the character development and the way the story slowly begins to catch your attention, creeping up on you and before you know it your totally absorbed.

It just didn't belong.My big problem with the film: It was just a few minutes too long. I think a far better ending than having him make the march up Maya's stairs to knock at her door would have been to end it in the burger joint. He sits there, swirling his beloved ""61"" in that polystyrene cup, stares out the window into the distance, fade to black. That's a FAR more complex ending than showing us that he marches back to Maya.

Indeed, at times I found it to be rather tedious. And am I mistaken, or did the premise not come straight out of ""Swingers"" -- two buddies hit the road, one a successful womanizer, the other still lamenting an ended relationship. The only difference is that the guys in ""Swingers"" were younger, more likable, and much more comedic.

Basically, one of them is getting married and the other is hating it for having divorced his wife who has a good palate for wines. This guys a writer. If you've been to Solvang, where much of the film takes place, you'll appreciate this movie some. If you like wines, you'll appreciate this movie some. But, if you're looking for more than a good buddy picture that involves wine-tasting, compromising situations, and angst foo, than see something else.

I figured, I'd have nothing to identify with here...but hey what the heck, I'll check it out.My advice to you is to follow my lead...check this movie out. Everyone can identify with at least one of the four main characters on some level. You know you have the sex-obsessed friend or the intelligent one. You have the friend who feels sorry for him/herself and the sexy one who gets all the attention. Whether you know these people or are these people, you'll walk away from this movie feeling as if you just hung out with them and better yet, got to know them.In my opinion, the movie's subtle climax is this incredible speech given by Virginia Masden about the age of wine. You feel like she's talking to you. Then she ends this heartfelt speech with ""...and it tastes so f**king good."" How more real can you get?

The film does not disappoint. Although he has left behind his favorite Nebraskan settings in favor of Californian vineyards, the movie is recognisably Payne - complete with endearing losers, roadside mishaps, and big-boned naked people. Miles (Giamatti) is a failing author and serious wine connoisseur suffering from ultra-low self esteem. His super-confident former college roommate Jack (Church) is about to get married so the pair embark on a week of pre-wedding bonding. The beauty of the movie stems from this unlikely pairing which is brought to life magnificently by a sharp script and great performances from the male leads. Payne finds comic material in the most mundane situations and many moments are laugh-out-loud funny, but as in About Schmidt and Election the characterisation is so vivid that the film's conclusion carries real emotional weight. Virginia Madsen and Sandra Oh provide super support, showing us new sides of both Miles and Jack as their journey becomes increasingly more eventful. About Schmidt was a more moving experience, but Sideways packs in more laughs... and you'll never look at a bottle of wine the same way again.",Sideways
625,digriz60,Too Oft the Hype,3,11 May 2005,"Oooh, I wanted to kill myself for being roped into watching this movie from all the hype. I was sold a funny comedy, but what I got was a ROMANTIC comedy. Same crap happened when I saw Mystery, Alaska. What I thought was a hockey movie turned out to be a chick flick. What did I hate about this movie? The same thing I hated about Lost in Translation: the director thinks the audience is so stupid, that he has to bludgeon us on the head with the central theme over and over. I understood in the first 10 minutes wine was going to be used as an allegory for life. How artsy! Then came Paul Giamatti, reprising his role as Harvey Pekar, Pig Vomit...hell, he only has one character. Don't get me wrong. I like Paul. I think he plays his one role with edginess and exuberant anger, twitchiness and nervous agitation that makes us all uneasy watching him. But I hated that he merely served the role of Mr. Wine Exposition Guy. All the lecturing about tannins and legs and nose, I felt like I couldn't escape my point above that the narrative was less a subtle intertwining about the living characteristics of wine as much as it was a brash display of exposition just in case I didn't get it the first 75 times it was mentioned! No movie can be complete without a forced romantic situation, and Sideways was no different. The juxtaposition of the immature charismatic idiot vs. the semi-intelligent loser is not an original theme, and it quickly wore thin after Jack too easily picks up Stephanie...resulting in her superlative rejoinder ""Guess I need to be spanked"" This is what passes for Oscar winning screen writing? The impact of this movie has been far reaching and destructive. The aging Docker's crowd, who in the eighties would have been watching Thirtysomething and working on their comb over, have taken one line from the movie and decimated the sales for Merlot. He says ONE FREAKING LINE about it, and everyone now thinks it's cool to chug Pinot Noir instead of Merlot. Before seeing the DVD I, too, had heard about the Merlot comment, and thought it would AT LEAST be a subplot. No, it was one simple rant in an alley. Nice...the movie that rides the wave of wine popularity single handedly kills one varietal with an offhand comment.This movie was directly targeted at my demographic, aging GenXers who are slowly transitioning from reckless miscreants to prosperous workers and refined members of society. This whole movie, however, smelled like a Rogaine commercial. Get together with your friends. Wear your relaxed waist slacks. Spend an evening in your backyard with other successful, attractive couples sipping wine and talking about wine and feeling smug you know so much about wine. Now everyone can watch this movie and feel like a pseudo-intellectual. I feel to some extent people just want to be a part of something, and cultural phenomena is a perfect way for them to feel included. By watching Sideways, people can feel part of that semi cultured clique, much in the same way those who enjoyed the Rubick's Cube or Pet Rock belonged to their respective elite clubs. Take away the Giamatti's frantic anger and Sideways is just another over-hyped, contrived romantic mess.",Sideways
626,jtpatrone,One of the best movies I have seen in a long time,9,22 December 2004,"Alexander Payne strikes gold with this movie. I loved Election and was disappointed by About Scmidt but this movie strikes a cord. Paul Giammatti shines in every role I have seen him in and does so in this one also. Thomas Hayden Church, who I never would have thought for his role is great as the sleazy , about to be groom who wants to have one more affair and is so taken by Sandra Oh that he considers calling the wedding off. Virgnia Madsen is great also as the woman Miles (Giamatti) pines for.What's more , Payne obviously did his wine research and some of his metaphors about wine and relationships are touching.Those who complained about the language and sex talk- it's about two middle aged men. If you want clean language go see a Disney movie",Sideways
627,swrightmac,Best Film I've seen all year,10,15 November 2004,"(I apologize for any spelling errors)I was intrigued by the online trailer and not disappointed in the least! I found the characters well developed, the dialogue realistic, the wine lessons interesting, and the whole experience a total joy. I need to see it again to catch what was missed during the laughter of the audience. Thomas Hayden Church (where HAS he been?) was superb as was Paul Giamatti. I don't think an Oscar nom. is out of the question for Giamatti. You could feel the torment, pain, insecurity and discomfort he experienced in every scene. A thought provoking storyline without all the special affects audiences are usually bombarded with was a welcome change (I'd just seen Polar Express). The scene between Madsen and Giamatti on the porch as they discussed their favorite wines was touching and brilliant. The timing was flawless as just as you thought it was going to become truly maudlin and a tear-jerker, something hilarious happened to remind you it was a comedy. The descriptions of the wine and the near-fanaticism that many wine enthusiasts love to bestow upon their guests was totally on and realistic. I fear the negative critics of the movie may have expectations too high for any fiction film and may need to lighten up a bit. It's not a documentary, rather a humorous look at life with some very witty and poignant observations. Definitely worth the charge of admission and the price of the DVD when available! Ten stars (or points?).",Sideways
628,Zengrrl,An entertaining adult slice-of-life movie that favors fine dialogue and fine wine over special effects.,9,28 January 2005,"Miles (Paul Giamatti) and Jack (Thomas Haden Church) have been friends since rooming together as freshmen in college. Post-college, the two embarked on different life paths: for Jack, fame and fortune as an actor on soaps; for Miles, a career as a English teacher with a burning desire to be a published author. Though the two friends seem diametrically opposite, they both have a mountain of neuroses that need to be worked through.As the movie begins, Jack is a week out from marriage. Miles, freshly divorced, decides to take his best friend on a final fling trip. He hopes to impart his passion for wine upon Jack. Jack hopes to impart passions of a different sort upon the women he meets along the way.Mid-way into the trip, Miles takes Jack to one of his favorite haunts, where he confesses he has feelings for the regular waitress, Maya (Virginia Madsen). Jack makes a connection with one of Maya's friends, Stephanie (Sandra Oh), and the two set up Miles and Maya for a double-date. This is more difficult than it seems, as both are gun-shy from recent bad relationships. And as Jack's web of lies deepens, all of the relationships become strained, even the friendship between Miles and Jack.Sideways is a multi-level movie. On the surface, it's a buddy movie; a rites of passage adult road trip. Dig deeper and it's a look at the cause and effect that's a constant in our lives.But the main charm of Sideways is that it is truly a movie about people. The good and the bad, without clichés or apologies. As the lies become exposed, happy endings do not magically appear. The verbal interaction is well-written and the actors deliver smoothly, without making it feel like they're script-reading. Even the wine dialogue is executed so that even the most novice drinker feels knowledgeable enough to crack open a bottle when they get home from the theater. Director Alexander Payne wisely allows the story to tell itself. Nothing feels forced or rushed.Much of the success of this movie is due to the quartet of leads. Giamatti takes what could be a caricature of a neurotic writer and imbues it with multi-toned edges. Miles is depressed about his life and divorce, but he's also passionate about wine and hopeful that something good will eventually happen to him. Church, familiar to most from his stint on the TV show, ""Wings,"" somehow manages to make the caddish Jack likable, even through the lies and deceit. As Maya, Madsen carefully echoes Mile's passion for wine and distrust of relationships, but instead of feeling sorry for herself, Madsen allows Maya to be optimistic that the changes she's made will be for the better. The firecracker of the group is Oh's portrayal of free-spirited wine barrista, Stephanie, who does everything in her life with the passion throttle on 11 -- even when it comes to releasing her anger.This film is not going to impress those who feel it's not a movie worth seeing without big explosions or special effects. But if you give it a chance, you'll enjoy the adult slice-of-life glimpse that Sideways offers.",Sideways
629,danclay,Best Ever,10,12 August 2011,"Simply one of the best films ever made. Funny, touching and insightful with both brilliant performances and script. Alexander Payne is undoubtedly one of the best directors around (along with Nolan and Fincher). If you enjoy this then check out Election too - sharper and more satirical but very funny too. Giamatti and Hayden Church as the perfect pairing here - would be great to see them work together again in some kind of ""The Trip"" setting perhaps to act as a post-modern comparison to this, although if they never meet again then at least we have this delightful gem to cherish for always. A thinking man's movie for drinking, thinking men!",Sideways
630,fischman-4,Why was this movie so popular?,3,22 April 2005,"While the two main characters are pathetic, that's not reason enough to dislike the film. Many great movies have had pathetic characters. Simply put, this movie goes nowhere, not much happens in it, and there is not a single show of acting panache worthy of the claim 'character actor'.It's strange that this movie got so much adoration when against the standard of other great American 'pathos' films of the last twenty years, such as Woody Allen's best ones, there is not much to it. People seem to have reveled in the subtlety with which Sideways' characters and their relations were revealed. But it's simpler than that. The movie is about a stupid few days spent in a motel or thereabouts, by a boor who continually engages in stupid behavior and his friend who is a depressed alcoholic.Sideways is decent only when not judged against the standard of other truly great, 'simple' films. It is slow and its scenes relatively pedestrian.",Sideways
631,danielmckay,"Good movie, but depressing and overrated",6,29 May 2005,"I really wanted to like this movie as much as all the critics seem to. It is definitely original, and feels very authentic and real, but after watching it, it seems to me that that just might be why its so highly praised by critics. Professional movie critics who watch 250 movies a year are naturally going to gravitate towards something thats unique and decidedly un-Hollywood.Paul Giamatti as a chronically depressed underachieving loser English teacher, win connoisseur and would be author, and his buddy from college played by Thomas Hayden Church who has a problem with infidelity come across as remarkably likable guys, and its a testament to their acting abilities that I wasn't turned off by their characters. They take a trip to central California's wine-country for one last middle-aged hurrah before Church's character gets married. All the locations, the situations, they all feel very real, and I appreciated that.Virginia Madsen and the always reliable Sandra Oh also do excellently in their parts as the worn-but-still-glamorous 40-ish waitress and her free spirit winery bartender friend, and I really wanted both couples to end up together. Madsen and Giamatti's scene on a porch having a conversation about wine that was in reality just a reflection of their own torn-up lives was pretty much the apex of this movie. If there is something within the movie itself that the movie will be remembered for, it will be that scene.Unfortunately, I just found the whole thing to be unbelievably depressing, and while to an extent that was the point, I came away from the movie feeling worse than when I had started it.That's OK for a movie like The Day After, or something thats supposed along those lines, but in my opinion thats not okay for something thats ostensibly a mild comedy.That brings me to my other major problem with the movie. It just wasn't that funny. There were a few funny set pieces or jokes like the whole last minute subplot about Church's wallet, and but it just wasn't enough, and there just weren't enough laughs to temper the whole sadness of the thing.Even though the end held out tapered upwards slightly with some hope held out for Giamatti's character, it just wasn't enough. It was too abrupt, and I felt like I had been cheated out of a real ending. While there is definitely quite a bit of artistic merit to this movie, I can't really say the same about the entertainment value, and by the end I just felt as depressed as Giamatti's character was for most of the movie.",Sideways
632,Drowning_Lessons,The Best Movie I've seen in 2004,10,7 December 2004,"Honestly, if you see only one movie this year, I would recommend it be Sideways. Granted I'm more a fan of indi films than Hollywood Blockbusters, and I'm in the minority that thought Kill Bill 2 was better than Vol. 1. Still, I have to say that this tour de force gem has made its mark on the movie industry, hopefully propelling Paul Giamatti and Thomas Hayden Church to the status of bankable actors.The story--two old friends go on a roadtrip to celebrate one's last week of freedom before marriage--at first might strike you as clichéd and overdone, but Alexander Payne's rendition of Pickett's novel is anything but. Set in wine country, this movie explores tasting, wineries and the culture of Napa Valley as intricately as it does relationships, and one is a lovely metaphor for the other. The characters are relatable (if we haven't been them we know them), and the plot takes a tired old idea and gives it fresh life.Paul Giamatti delivers the best performance of his career, and the most poignant of the year. At every moment he is completely believable, from his most comedic (running away goofily from his friend while downing a whole bottle of wine after receiving bad news) to his most dramatic (talking about himself vicariously through the metaphor of pinot noir).Thomas Hayden Church does equally well, and the two actors together work as a comedy team, Laurel and Vonnegut, if you will. At once arrogant, conceited and deeply insecure, Church portrays the macho archetype with such humanity that it leaves one breathless.Virginia Madsen is the perfect counterbalance to the men's quirky relationship, and Sandra Oh delivers a magical blend of real life and the fantasy that can only be invented on a road trip movie such as this one. Add to that Payne's quirky sense of artistic delivery and stunning cinematography (split screen for humor, and the most well-shot drunk scene I've ever seen on celluloid), and you get a solid gold knock-out.And as the movie reaches its conclusion, it takes a twist that not even the most battle-hardened moviegoer can expect. Its ending is artistic, touching, and the antithesis of Hollywood. I'm quite surprised this became a major, wide-scale release, but am gratified at the thought that so many people will be able to enjoy this frenetic and poignant lark of a picture. Don't be fooled by its comedic exterior--at the core of this movie is heart that runs deeply, even in the funniest scenes.Easily a 10/10, and the best movie I've seen since Lost in Translation.",Sideways

The film had a few laugh-worthy scenes, after the 1hour and 30 minute mark, but alas, I would never recommend it to my worst enemy! The one defense for this monstrosity was that the acting and the emotion shown by Giamatti was superb. You could really see his conflicting thoughts and feelings throughout.

And Sandra Oh rounds out the cast nicely with a small, memorable role as the bad-girl vixen who wants to be made good.I still believe Giamatti should have gotten the Oscar for this - his reactions in the final 10 minutes alone should have clinched it.

638,tjmechman,Mildly entertaining comedy-drama.,7,28 April 2005,"After recently viewing this movie, and not having too high expectations despite it's Oscar buzz, I was left feeling the following: As a modern commentary on the trials and tribulations of post-divorce stress and depression, it is easy to relate to Paul Giamatti's character Miles, a truly caring schlub with a big heart. However, at times you just want to reach through the screen, shake him, and tell him to get over himself AND his ex-wife, just as his pal Jack, played by Thomas Haden Church, is trying to tell him. Jack is a somewhat endearingly despicable playboy, acting like he's 20 years younger than he is despite the fact that he's about to wed a woman who is apparently what he's waited a long time for. Sandra Oh's Stephanie, the object of Jack's charms, gives him a hard-earned lesson on the importance of being earnest. Trust me, he had it coming. The real bright spot of character development throughout this tale is Maya, played by Virginia Madsen. She is lovely, enchantingly charming, and understandingly forgiving, as is learned toward the end of the movie. It would have been nice to learn a little more of the back story of Miles and Jack's relationship other than simply knowing they were freshman roommates at college. Without that, it is difficult to understand how they came to the point of wanting to take this road trip through California's wine country together. And therein lies the rub, why I am unable to give this movie a strong recommendation. Only a mild one. My summary: Good character development, fine performances and direction, story and situations were a bit weak. 7 out of 10 stars.",Sideways

Time, the film is funny to yell, then heartbreakingly bitter - and, at best, both. As Miles put back into a crisis, he wants to get drunk at a wine tasting, but the waiter does not play, it gives nothing more. It comes to blows, then grabs the giant Miles Ausspuckbottich and pours it over his body to get his dose of wine. This scene is representative of the class of ""Sideways"". The sequence is insanely funny, but scary at the same time human bitter and sad.Wine connoisseurs Alexander Payne focuses on his journey through the wine country of California's not on fixed moral values, for example, voters who appreciate the acting U.S. President George W. Bush clowns Sun Miles steals from his elderly mother when he was paying her a visit to the birthday. The ease with which Payne acts like it here. He condemned the characters for their obvious error, but rather simply pursue their way. Also creates the highly unfaithful Thomas Haden Church is to make it look appealing his jacket. The viewer is willing to forgive the characters their shortcomings, because there is so much fun to follow their adventures.

640,Nooner66,Truly awful,2,28 January 2008,"A movie singularly convinced of its own wit, subtlety and intelligence:A movie which is sadly misguided, on all 3 counts.Sideways is - notionally - a road-trip movie with a twist; the twist being that the 2 male leads/main characters are both ""hilariously well observed, finely nuanced characters, wading about in a veritable sea of narcissism and self doubt"". Read: the odd couple, but with some more flaws. One is a ""jock"", and you've met him before the other is a faux-aesthete with rather a lot to say about wine. Ditto with regards to having met him before.The film's ""narrative"" is driven by a series of wine tasting experiences & related/subsequent HiJinks, and its favourite conceit is tied into this: the characters talk about wine, in a way which ""subtly"" (and yes, it does deserve the ""finger quotes"") references life. It truly is nothing more than a shallow conceit.Many reviewers have submitted negative comments based on how unlikeable the 2 lead's are - and they are justified in doing so, as they are intensely unlikable characters' whose finest ""nuance"" measures at least several feet from side to side. The writers' approach to subtlety is nicely summed up in one scene in particular, where it is revealed that one of the leads is an awful man who steals from his mother. It is never mentioned again. The writers seem to believe that this happening and then never being alluded to again somehow constitutes subtlety - but it doesn't. However, the rot goes deeper: the film is poorly scripted, poorly directed and shot (the camera simply points at whatever is happening, in sequence), and poorly edited. The editing is especially worthy of being poked with sharp, hard objects, as every (EVERY) scene and shot fades into the next, in a manner which would cheapen a budget recording of a wedding or christening - let alone a movie.I have never seen a more awe-inspiringly pretentious film in my entire life - and I've seen Crash.",Sideways

Her scintillating chemistry with Giamatti during their couch scene over a glass of Sonoma's finest was absolutely breathtaking.This film is a testament to the fact that you don't need to be the best looking guy to ""get the girl"", as long as you can make up for it with passion, class and sophistication.-Stephen Haine",Sideways

I thought it might be better than my favourite American film of recent times, ""The Station Agent"", but that would have been asking a little too much.It did not have my total attention until about 5 minutes after the start when I became riveted with concentration.

What I can say is that it follows the adventures of two best friends, played brilliantly by Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church, who must come to terms with the realities of their lives and where its taking them. Although slow to start off, the film picks up with comic intensity and often witty dialogue. The relationship between Church's and Giamatti's characters and the people they affect around them during their adventure are cleverly brought together with wit and humor. I found myself laughing uncontrollably at times and really got into the characters, the mistakes they make and the consequences that followed. The film is based on a novel that I have heretofore been unaware of.

Paul Giamatti was the only thing that saved this movie from being a 1 in my opinion. Virginia Madsen had moments as well but Paul Giamatti really carried the entire movie alone in my opinion. I guess maybe part of the point was just how one dimensional Jack's character was but I can't help but feel that Thomas Hayden Church is just not a good actor. He seemed stiff and forced at trying to portray Jack. Were we supposed to buy that scene when he cried about not wanting to lose his fiancée, and believe that he finally had his epiphany? Or were we supposed to believe that he just can't stand the thought of being alone and facing that he has nothing real in his life? I just couldn't tell what direction his character was in because Thomas Hayden Churches acting was so darn deadpan just like on Wings.

Virgina Madsen offered up an honest look at someone with whom we can identify, someone we know; Paul Giamatti's portrayal of Miles was deliciously uncomfortable, as we also have a friend like Miles. The scene between the two of them, exploring their obsessions with wine is Oscar-worthy and the highlight of the film.

The one star folks need to go back, pour a glass from the box and try again, because they are TOTALLY missing it. Miles and Jack are the same person as are Maya and Stephanie. While I was watching I began asking myself ""Why are these 2 people even friends?"". The two characters are such opposites. What is the point of that? It has to be the only answer. It's not a movie about two friends. It's an inner struggle about one man's indecision about commitment and finally really growing up. The girls are used to illustrate this point, specifically when Miles is explaining to Maya about the tenderness of the grape. He's not talking about grapes. He's opening up about himself. The same with his big book. It's his life story and only one person wants to read it and actually likes it. Jack represents the fake ""everything is just fine"" face we all use in public but when we're alone we begin to question our significance. Once I realized the genius behind this device I was hooked.A great story about every one of us.",Sideways
649,elizabethjean79,Entertaining and Funny,6,20 May 2005,"I was looking for a light and entertaining movie mid-week and this definitely hit the spot. I love movies about everyday life, everyday trials and tribulations. I like seeing ordinary people with extraordinary lives and complex inner turmoils that need to be resolved through working with other people and finding new relationships. Although I'm not a 'drinker' in the conventional sense, the main character's need for a glass of wine (or a bucket!) when things got rough or a situation was unbearably uncomfortable, definitely hit home--like one of the pink elephants in the living room nobody talks about. Why does one find so many people in bars as soon as the five o'clock whistle blows? It was funny to see this taken to the extreme sometimes. I would recommend this movie to watch with a group of friends and a bottle of wine (or two). Very funny!",Sideways

""laugh-out loud funny"", yeah right!!! i laughed in two of the scenes (on the golf course and the wallet retrieval) and that was it. and i think it was more hysterical, i cant believed i paid good money for this laughter. the characters were boring, unrealistic and just dull.the only good thing about the movie was the credits.",Sideways
651,Charley123,Great Acting -- 30 Something Script,7,19 November 2004,"I liked this movie. 7 out of 10. The acting and directing were very good -- you saw every nuance of thought and feeling. However, all this talent was pretty much wasted on a script that turned out to be little more than a bloated two-part 30 SOMETHING episode. Not that that's necessarily bad -- I think 30 SOMETHING was pretty good. It just means that there's nothing too original here. Really, its little more than a bunch of acting exercises strung together -- very well performed -- but not adding up to a heck of a lot. Not that that will stop people from loving it. Critics are so desperate for anything with any substance that they'll fall all over themselves trying to get people into the theaters to see what they think people should be watching. Plus, I think it should do well at Oscar time since the majority of academy members are actors and actors fall all over themselves for great acting exercises they can perform in acting classes. As long as you get to be all emotionally constipated who cares if the story adds up to anything worthwhile?",Sideways

This movie's ending was unforgivably bad. I know it was based on a book, but a little ""creative editing"" might have been of benefit for the book to screen conversion.The ending makes sense, and fits the characters, but that doesn't make it good. I say nay. If you like movies which don't make your ass hurt from a crappy ending, skip this movie. If you're a bit of a hater and like to be smacked around by writers and directors -- well pull up a chair, this movie will not fail you.",Sideways
653,ymifelch-1,this is not the comedy hit of the year,2,6 April 2005,"After reading the reviews and finding the movie was given a 8 star rating, i expect to see a super movie. What i got was a boring slow paced movie on wine drinking, with very little laughs. Comedy hit of the year? Maybe if i drink a case of wine and return for a second viewing i may laugh once. come to think of it, after drinking a case of wine and staring a rock for for over two hours, i may get even more laughs. I just don't understand why this movie got such a high rating. What did others see in this movie that i did not? Maybe members of the film industry wrote the reviews to boost attendance, or rental of the the movie. That could explain the high reviews. Forgive me for rambling on, as i need 10 lines to summit a review . when there's not much to say about a average at best motion picture. there are many great movies out there, but this in not one of them. To sum up if you want to learn about drinking wine get a good book on it. If you what a great movie to make you laugh pass this one by.",Sideways
654,bearachanseo,This movie didn't realize how great it was!,10,20 August 2007,"A great cast that work in concert with each other to bring out the best of each. It has a storyline and actors that are believable (although the first time you see the movie you despise Miles for stealing from his mother, and you probably loathe Jack for his philandering ways). What could be better but a week-long road trip in the wine country free of the cares and worries of your San Diego (Miles)and LA life (Jack)! The superb dialog (at certain points in the movie) and scenes are perfect and the lighting is spectacular. It doesn't pretend to show you only the glorious and pretty aspects (wine tasting and cruising through the wine country in Mile's Saab). It also shows you the crustier side: Mile's dingy apartment at the opening scene and later when he recovers his beloved Château Cheval Blanc after the wedding, and also the garbage-laden house of Cammi on the ""other side of the railroad tracks"". You really empathize with Miles in this movie. He displays that morose demeanor and far-off glance/stare at times in the movie and you can't help but feel sorry for him--what a great acting performance!!!-Many have already said it in this forum, but he WAS absolutely robbed of an academy award for his performance. We saw this movie at the theater when it was first released, and have the DVD now. Each time I re-watch it, I get a little more pleasure out of it. Maybe its because I grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area, and maybe its because I graduated from Cal Poly SLO, maybe its a dozen other things. Those of us that are middle aged or past will recognize the unfulfilled dreams that Miles and Jack portray. Jack has settled (with Christine), and Miles has given up hope--that is until he listens to his voicemail almost a week after leaving wine country. This movie, I think should be classified as one the best made movies of this millennium. I am hoping that Rex will write a sequel to this movie-- the first ending left so many hopeful possibilities for Miles.",Sideways

Unless this had some magical ending I can't figure out what people thought of this movie. I am 38 so it's not like I couldn't understand the humor. I think maybe someone my mothers age of 69 may have enjoyed this but for me it was dull! The acting was good but the story just dragged. I think I could have more fun at an open casket funeral....Wow, just realized I don't have enough lines, but there really isn't much more to say other than I would recommend this for people who do not like the kind of humor I enjoy such as movies like Dumb and Dumber, Friday and Friday after next, even Next Friday which was not near as good as the other two were much better than this film. 3/10",Sideways

Its a great story for a person who looses all hope in life, and everything he has, feeling like a loser... THe directing was OK, the script was great. I related to the film, i felt for the character of Miles...he portrays the perfect type of man who feels he lost everything he has...whatever age you are you will relate to it. Paul GIamatti...GREAT GREAT GREAT PERFORMANCE, deserved an academy award nomination..great job...he BECAME that man, and portrayed him perfectly..

Somehow I talked him into seeing Sideways instead, mainly because we were both impressed by Paul Giamatti in American Splendor. I had heard all the buzz about this movie for so long that I was convinced I would be disappointed, but I wanted to see it anyway. Long story short, we both laughed our rears off and learned a little about wine at the same time. The writing is wonderful and the cast is perfect, particularly Giamatti. He's almost too good at the lonely loser role; that's gotta be why he's not nominated for an Oscar.In summary, don't let the award-show buzz scare you away from this movie; it actually makes for a really fun evening!",Sideways

The conversations between Miles and Maya are what is good about film and gave me hope that there are actually intelligent screenwriters who will give ADULTS the goods. The cinematography and music is splendidly done. Paul Giamatti deserved his Golden Globe nomination for his turn as Miles and deserved but did not receive an Oscar nomination. Thomas Haden Church is equally brilliant as Jack, the epitome of a middle aged juvenile whose shenanigans are classic. Sandra Oh is super sexy as Stephanie and Virginia Madsen gives a strong performance as Maya, the uber cool chick with brains, beauty and a fair knowledge of wine. Sideways takes you to a place that is wonderful and real and you will long to return to after the credits roll. Giamatti's performance alone is worth a purchase of the DVD. A great film.",Sideways

I must confess that the first third of the movie was a little boring, getting to know the characters and all that. After that it gets more and more funny, and in many ways I could relate to his way of thinking and his troubles. The story's about two men going on a trip for a week, before the main characters friend is going to get married. They have decided to go wine tasting in Californias vineyards. As the movie progresses the main character realizes that his life is crap. It's been 2 years since his divorce and he is still calling his ex-wife when drunk, because of a heartache. His novel isn't going to get published and to make it all worse, his friend seems to be getting along fine, enjoying life and fooling around with women.

I'm usually a thankful spectator but this time I couldn't help but have a nap in the cinema. Is this a ""Dude Where Is My Car"" for wine-drinkers? A oenology course for the beer-and-coke-drinker? A prevention clip against AIDS? Excuse my lack of sensitivity to poor vocabulary distorted into pseudo-poetry... It's not telling you how, exactly, wine is produced in California, neither how it is ripened. So it can't be the oenology that motivated this movie. It doesn't tell you how, exactly, you should put a condom to use, only that you might need more than one per night. So it can't have been the prevention neither. Now, is it then all about just how drunk you can get on wine? How low you can go as a poor writer? How close Vineyards are to L.A.?

661,rubyrubin,One of the most boring movies ever,4,14 February 2005,"Every year, there is a very, very boring movie put out that some critics seem to love. My guess is that it's because critics are bored of exciting movies. I am a movie buff... seen thousands of movies. This movie is right up at the top of most boring, uneventful, predictable and uninteresting. What could be more exciting that two grown men taking a bachelor party....to go wine tasting? Oh what a surprise when Jack actually follows through on his plan and cheats on his fiancée! Clearly, that was the climax. There was one funny scene, which was horribly predictable, but I still had to laugh at least to wake myself up. Humor is relative and in a movie that boring, Police Academy 4 routines would have had me rolling.On a positive note, the actor who played Jack was pretty good. Not great, but pretty good.",Sideways

I thought this movie should not have won any awards and you could not pay me to sit through it again. If you like dry comedy then watch something else. I am very serious i don't know how people could enjoy this movie because there wasn't anything to it! The plot was not developed enough to keep me interested and it wasn't thought through properly. It did have potential to be funny but it didn't grab at it. The packaging should not contain comedy and it shouldn't not be even in that genre.

663,gascapgt,Expected more from independent cinema,1,18 April 2005,"""Sideways"" simply angered me. I have seen a lot of garbage films over the years but none has made me want my money - or time- back more than this film, and I only paid $1 to rent it. How this movie achieved such popularity is almost beyond me. It is the type of mass-produced, ""been there, seen that"" type of garbage that one expects from Hollywood... making it a horrible disgrace to independent cinema. There was a line in the movie that goes something like ""book publishers don't care about the quality of the story, the only want marketing value nowadays"". Now that's ironic. That line describes perfectly what is wrong with this film - it's got no content, but boy did the press make you want to see it.Independent film is innovative and daring. There was nothing new about this movie, it was a weak film born from the ""road trip"" mold where a couple of characters travel together who are complete opposites and ultimately learn something from each other. The characters are horribly developed, anyone with half a brain can predict what's going to happen in every given scene. First graders who have only ever performed a Christmas pageant could out-do the actors in this film, maybe even the sex scenes.Let's not forget that this movie was advertised as a comedy. There was absolutely no humor in this movie, or if there was, it was completely lost on me because I was in a frenzied state of rage.Spoiler: People note the funny"" scenes like the car being driven into the tree, the guy saying ""I'm not drinking any f-ing merlot"", and the woman saying ""I need to be spanked"". How is any of that funny? The whole movie is equally juvenile and pointless.Words can hardly describe how much I hated this movie. I would have liked it moderately more if it weren't so popular, but it's popularity just goes to show how stupid and immature the general public is. Sideways ranks below such garbage as - Scooby Doo 2, Shaft in Africa, League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, and Saved! If you want quality laughs, classic storyline, character development and drama, Sweatin' to the Oldies is a much better bet.",Sideways
664,gnlbarrett,Wasn't what expected,5,3 April 2005,"My girlfriend wanted to see this movie because the reviews she had been reading were saying what a great movie it was. Neither of us knew anything about the movie but our expectations were high considering it was a critics choice. I will admit it had quite a few funny scenes but for the most part I thought it dragged and lacked an appealing plot. Without exception the actors did a great job with their characters so my disappointment wasn't with the acting only the story. I can see a certain appeal with wine connoisseur provided the information about wine in the movie was accurate and how it could spur a renewed interest in wine and the coastal wine areas. However, we literally left thinking what was all the hype about!",Sideways
665,kramx_2005,Sideways: No taste worth leaving in my mouth!,6,8 April 2005,"Well, the Oscar season has finally settled down and now we, as regular people in DVD-Land can finally see for ourselves just what the heck the Academy got so excited about during February of this year. I have slowly been working my way through the list of major films that were highlighted by the press and Hollywood mania surrounding the prestigious event, from ""The Aviator"", ""Finding Neverland"", ""Ray"" and now ""Sideways."" Interestingly enough, this film stood very well on it's own during the competitive awarding, based purely on the fact it is a comedy, which hardly ever gets a real worthy candidate to represent the genre. But after just having watched it, I really feel let down and cheated from all the hype that surrounds it. In short, it wasn't all that great.Now I know that sounds unbelievable. How can someone possibly not like this film like everyone else does? How could I not love it? I'm not saying that it wasn't without it's creative charm or humorous bits. But it certainly wasn't the film that people, critics especially, glorified it as. It relied on so much foul language and sexual references and explicit visual scenarios that the underlying tone became hard to miss. We are supposed to laugh at the wild and unrealistic yet probable antics that Miles (Giamatti) and Jack (Chruch) get up to. The message and comparative metaphor of wine being so much like life in its composition and the care needed for it to be worth while is genuine and so unique, even innovative. It's the journey of sex, lies, and no videotape that turns the story from a good full-bodied wine into a flat can of Welch's Grape soda.Is it funny? On most parts yes, when the acting isn't forced or the situation played too far down by the seriousness of Jack's actions. But there is too much of these downside on the laughs to appreciate them or what the message, and yes there is one when you delve in a little, is all about. The critics and Hollywood darlings of our modern film industry find scandal and emotional turmoil to be entertaining and comic. That's fine. I too can appreciate that in films like ""I Heart Huckabees"", ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" and ""Lost in Translation"". The sexual exploitation and crudeness is not over balanced or used as a comic tool in any of these fantastic films. Language and sex are perfectly acceptable in films if they fit the characters and the situational flow of the film. Sideways just doesn't meet those requirements at all.To wrap things up, I would say to the average film-goer, this isn't for you, because it will go over your head, not because you may be too stupid or the plot to advanced, but because the pace and scripting is so boring and just a little vulgar. If you believe and watch for hype, this is right up there for your entertainment. This may sound odd-balled, but movies are about entertainment and a level of believability that make it honest and enjoyable. Sideways just doesn't do that. Even ""Elektra"" which had it's flaws in scripting and length, was by far more entertaining because of how it was handled. So, stick to water people, this wine is past it's peak before it even leaves the vine.",Sideways
666,kcadetx2,A moving story with a couple of chuckles thrown in,9,25 May 2005,"After reading the DVD box, I was expecting a light-hearted laugh-out-loud film...boy, was I in for a surprise. First, I must say I that I have a step-father who lives, sleeps, and dreams about wine. In that context, I found much of the subtle wine-based humor understandable and enjoyable. The first wine tasting scene is an accurate snapshot of the hyperbole often served with the vino. Second, I confess that I am 42 years-old, and many of the mid-life men's issues addressed between the two main characters seemed, at times, uncomfortably close to home. (****Spoilers follow****) However, what really struck me emotionally was the inner struggle and journey being made by Miles, the lead character. I, too, am two years out of a 15 year relationship, and I found myself riveted by Mr. Giamatti's performance. I can't tell you how many times I sat there with a lump in my throat having walked in very similar shoes to those he portrayed on the screen. The script addressed the common feelings of denial, longing, and hurt as Miles reflects on his recently failed relationship. The screenwriter also shows that Jack's prescription of ""getting laid"" as a remedy for Miles' chronic melancholy doesn't work even if Jack relies on it as a cure for his premarriage jitters.I felt the film spoke a wonderfully clear message of empathy and hope for anyone who has had a relationship or career failure in their life. Considering the divorce and bankruptcy rates in the United States, I think Sideways has a huge audience that could benefit from a viewing of this fine film....just be prepared that the tears it may trigger might not be from the laughter.In toto, a very fine film that is an average comedy but a brilliant character analysis.",Sideways

They are all fall down drunks who fall in love, or think so. I found their performances outstanding. Sandra Oh is excellent as a single mother who falls for Thomas Hayden Church. (You do see his white butt bouncing in the air which is more acting than he did on Wings.) She works for a winery and she goes out with Virginia Madsen and Giamatti to a place called the Hitching Post. The Oh and Church relationship on screen outshines any other love story in the movie. However, the film maker forgets people hate movies that are pretty scenery with just music playing. Much of this film is like a travelogue for California Wineries. You have no window into what they are saying as nothing is said in many scenes, just gad music. *******************SPOILER ALERT************************* Giamatti and Madsen fall in love, she reads his book and in the end she leaves him a very nice message.

668,abrooke66,A thinking person's film,8,17 May 2005,"(Minor spoilers) This is a film that is both simple and complex. Simple, in that it tells a simple story of two men, each of whom are ""damaged"" in various ways, and their relationships both to each other and to women. Complex, because the characters are complex, multi-dimensional and strangely likable, even though they may do things that repulse us.The film focuses an extreme amount on wine, perhaps too much so. I suppose the idea is that the main character Miles is like wine, needing a lot of care and attention to be complete, to ""ferment"" his soul.There is not too much action in the film, except for two gloriously funny scenes. One involves the retrieval of a lost wallet from a house and a jealous husband. The other, even more hilarious, involves the beating of a character using a motorcycle helmet. This second scene, which lasts only about 20 seconds, is one of the most hilarious sequences I've ever seen. You don't actually see the beating (it is implied) but it is still a wickedly violent and funny spectacle.All in all, this film is a funny and moving road trip experience.",Sideways

Suffice to say I was not a fan. What made the experience more frustrating was Sideways inability to decide what kind of movie it wanted to be, some parts are very funny granted, then it decides to switch to a depressed tone instantly throwing the viewer around, there is also romance between middle aged people which makes for unpleasant viewing, you simply could not class this movie it is nothing and it is everything.

As someone who lives and works in a California wine region, I speak from authority in saying that the screenplay gets so many fine details right about the personality of wine enthusiast, who can fine tune their love of wine into the met intimate details of their personal lives. Pauli Giamatti's performance was outstanding and it is a shame that the Academy Awards snubbed him of not just the Best Actor award—but he did not even receive a nomination!

672,robert-machin,everybody wins...,9,23 June 2005,"Great movie. A proper, grown-up movie, and how refreshing is that ? Not to say that it doesn't have its car wrecks (1), full-on sex (2) and ultra-violence (1), but I'm guessing that focus groups played no part in the making of this movie.The film is balanced on the relationship between Miles and Jack, both hitting pivotal points in their lives, both needing to escape for a while, both aiming to educate the other in, respectively, the finer and the coarser things. Jack needs to understand Pinot, Miles needs to get laid. Their objectives are, to say the least, somewhat in conflict - with hilarious results. By the end, though Miles has not only got laid, but run amok in a tasting shed, while Jack is picking up at least some of the pretentious vocabulary of the wine buff and running with it. Everybody wins! More importantly, everyone understands themselves - through one another - a little better and a resolution of sorts has been achieved.'Sideways' is the first film I've seen in a long time that I felt I had to watch again - I watched it twice in a weekend - but full of strange inconsistency and digression. Why is Miles apparently stealing money from his mother to finance this trip ? Why do they know so little about one another - is that supposed to be the way guys are? - and, given that, why are they rooming together ? Is Jack really just spinning Stephanie a line ? If so, he fooled me too... but the relationship was devalued by his enthusiasm for the next waitress he met (I felt like I'd been cheated too) ... and that in turn seemed a bit of a device to justify the wallet scene and up the broad comedy a bit at the end... Miles enjoying a scene with a magazine was also a detail which seemed either unconvincing or not properly realised and just a bit seedy.Word of warning: though it picks up the pace dramatically from the mid point, it takes an age to get going, and to judge from my wife's reaction, female viewers may struggle through those first 40 minutes. But stick with it. The women raise the tempo and temperature of the film immeasurably and the relationship between Miles, Jack and particularly Mya, is luminous. In the end the inconsistencies float away and you just want to watch it again...And did I mention that it's really funny ? And that if you want to get all the laugh-out-loud moments, you need to watch it at least twice (if you're as slow on the uptake as me, anyway).",Sideways

It is a very well-made, well-acted film, technically competent in every way -- but it has no substance. It's like watching a very big-budget episode of 30something -- you have emotionally adrift unappealingly narcissistic characters interacting in such a way that the world is a worse place for it, and then, at the end, it's over.There are dozens and dozens of films that have been made about unappealing characters that still generate some pathos and empathy, but by the end of Sideways I really didn't give a damn if any of these idiots ever got over whatever midlife crisis they were having. There were moments of humor and feeling, but overall, the script, plot, and characterization were devoid of anything special that deserves to be watched for hours, much less argued over as great film.Watchable, and interesting for technical study, such as the wonderful cinematography.",Sideways

That's North of San Francisco -- Northern California. This movie takes place in Solvang, California, near Santa Barbara -- Southern California. Solvang is not ""the California wine country"". This is where L.A. people go to taste wine. The California wine country is in the Napa Valley, about 370 miles North of the location of this film. Many people who saw this film did not like it because they thought it was going to be about wine tasting in the Napa Valley; not a tragic-comedy about relationships, marriage, and middle age. That is really too bad, because, the film is hysterical. Miles and Jack are completely believable characters.

675,katherinekatherine,Certainly doesn't deserve a 'Highly Recommended' sticker (no major spoilers),1,28 July 2005,"I was shocked to see on the DVD case that 'Sideways' has won 3 major film awards and even has comments saying it is 'The funniest film of the year' and 'Unmissable'. For me, 'Sideways' was a struggle to watch and three quarters of the way through I gave up. (Apologizes to anyone who watched it all the way through, where it apparently picked up, according to my Dad) The 'funniest film of the year' certainly didn't live up to its praise, I hardly laughed at all and when there was any humour, it was hardly side-splitting. For example, Jack chases Miles down a steep hillside with amusing music in the background: award- winning comedy? The boring scenes where we a silent Jack and Miles driving through the vineyard-full countryside are completely pointless, even using split-screens doesn't liven boring snapshots of roadsides and wildlife. There didn't seem any attempt at making wine interesting to anyone who knew nothing about it, which was odd because it became the main feature of the film. Jokes about Pinot wines washed over me completely. Even though the acting seemed to be good, it still couldn't endear me to these two awful characters. Jack is foul-mouthed, arrogant and a cheat, whilst Miles is a slightly creepy, wine lover who spends his time writing rubbish and steals from his mother.

676,naerhu,A movie about scum,2,17 August 2005,"I cannot believe all the hype this movie received. Except for the acting, which was totally brilliant, I was stunned as to how bad this movie was by the first five minutes into it. This is the worst movie I have seen since 13th Warrior.First, throughout the whole movie there are totally rude and degrading comments about 8th grade English teachers. As if that were the worst job in the world. Well, I didn't like most of my English teachers, but I see as an adult, that the teaching of children is the most noble of all professions. Why this movie would go out of its way to disrespect them, I have no idea.Miles is a man so horrible that he steals money from his own mother. His best attribute is that he is self-hating. For that character, its a good attribute, because he is an alcoholic, thieving liar.Jack, the other main character of the movie, is also scum. He is a liar and a disgusting womanizer. Days before his marriage, his only goal is to shag anything that moves, without a care for his targets.This movie is so totally unrealistic. Why would a beautiful and confident woman like Maya date a pudgy, depressed moron like Miles? How is this movie supposed to inspire us? What are we to learn from this? That humans are fragile and hopelessly weak? Are we to learn that stealing from family and ruthlessly breaking peoples hearts is OK? Avoid this movie, unless you accept living with ""diminished expectations"" is acceptable.",Sideways
677,crewmanwilson,Film Makers Need to Learn How to End Their Stories,3,5 July 2008,"This movie epitomizes all that is wrong with American men. Although it has a good cast, and gorgeous cinematography it does not make up for the fact that this movie is an extremely pessimistic look at the male American.Why do film makers think that a good premise for a movie is to glorify the stupid things men do in the pursuit of sex? The only thing achieved by this film is its ability to show that some men have yet to evolve passed the ape form. If I were a man I would be extremely upset about how I was represented in this film not just by Jack but by Miles, and just about every male character in the film except maybe Victoria's new husband.The end, however, has to be the worst part of this abomination of a film. It absolutely repulses me when film makers and or writers decide to leave their audiences hanging at the end of the film. This to me just shows how little they actually care about the audience and that in creating a cliffhanger they are really just being lazy rather than creative.Anyone who likes this film probably only likes it because it was accepted with such open arms by the snotty, over-processed film festival regulars who think they are God's gift to film.This movie has tarnished the beauty of not just California but also California wine country.

I got a strong case of homesickness for San Diego, though it was going to be good. The film was OK until the 'actors' started speaking. They sounded like bad theatre students reading lines to one another, very stilted and boring. I felt no connection to either character so I ended up just turning off this mind-numbing piece of crap. I should have figured if it got such great reviews from critics, I would hate it.

It's understandable that women would not be able to relate to a depressive loser or a oversexed middle aged man fearful of tying the knot. Both represent their two biggest fears in men. But in order to appreciate this movie, you need to move beyond the ""likability"" of the characters or the possibility that the behavior of these men could secretly resemble the man you are presently in a relationship with.Neither Giamatti or Taylor are role models. Let's get that out of the way, but wow are they real. Every guy can relate to one of their characters or knows someone they remind them of. The dialogue is magnificent and the pace is perfect. There's not really a dull moment in the movie even though it's 90% dialogue.As diametrically opposed as the characters are, they work well on screen together.

A ridiculous idea of course, but at least they're honest about what the film is. As the theatre filled up with New York artist/executives fresh out of the cocktail bar where they discussed last week's episode of The Apprentice I knew I was in for something interesting. Sideways turned out to be pretentious garbage enjoyed by people who don't understand what makes a quality movie and defer to the opinions of cliché pandering, trend worshiping, social idiots. I love intelligent movies. I appreciate something new and different. This movie has nothing in that vain but paints the portrait of four horrible individuals without reason.

Thomas Haden Church, who I normally like, is a total horn-dog, made worse by the fact that he's a dishonest boor and likes the f-bomb a little too much.Miles, played by Paul Giamatti, is whiny, wimpy, and totally depressing. And steals from his mother. Why should we care about this guy? I hated his smug wine commentaries. Eeyor is more interesting.After 40 minutes of this trash I was wishing they'd drive their Saab over a cliff in a nod to Thelma and Louise.Virginia Madsen as Maya is the only remotely interesting character, and the only reason this piece of tripe deserves more than a one.

During the trip, Jack was very keen to get laid before getting married and dragged Miles to his plan to make a date with some girls (Maya and Stephanie) which then ended up in a complicated situation. To me, the film is very fresh, good filming, simple plot, is a good comedy about life that shows kind of reality based on characters and situations reflected in ordinary people, with no Hollywood arrangements.

I haven't cried (I actually cried towards the end) or truly felt deep pain or empathy for a character in a while, but Giamatti pulls it off here. The plot isn't twisty or ""edge-of-your-seat"" which is so in vogue now (two guys on a wine tasting trip in Central California) nor is it Hollywood in any sense of the word.

However, there's one thing I wanted to point out. One of the major threads holding the film together is the friendship between Miles and Jack. Am I the only one who realizes that their relationship is completely unbelievable? First of all, the two of them have nothing in common, other than the fact that they're both totally self-absorbed and annoying. But that aside, let's say they still somehow were good friends, OK. There's still a problem. In his final week of bachelorhood, Jack's master plan is simply to ""get laid"" one last time before he's married. He makes it abundantly clear to Miles that all he's really interested in is having sex that week. So then, why in the world would he decide to go on a weeklong tour of WINE COUNTRY with his pessimistic, annoying, snobby alcoholic of a friend??? If he's trying to get girls, he would have to realize that having a loser like Miles around will do nothing but harm his chances at that. But there they are, the two ""pals"" out for an ""exciting getaway,"" traveling from winery to winery, ""living life to the fullest"". You've got to be kidding me, it's totally ridiculous, and really quite a stupid plot when you think about it. Even the dialogue between the two of them was moronic. Really simple and boring. But that's what the entire film was, simple and boring. And UNBELIEVABLY OVERRATED.",Sideways
689,viragolily,If good films are like a fine wine - this film is a Lambrini.,2,19 December 2006,"Before I went to see this film I had heard some fantastic reviews about this film, with many critics praising Payne's 'poignant' and 'hilarious' narrative, and hailing it as the film of the year. Can I just ask, were they watching the same film I saw? I have never been more bored whilst watching a film - and I've sat through many a Will Ferrell film (people the man is NOT a comedy genius, he's not even mildly amusing - when will you realise this?) The plot was self-indulgent, pompous, self absorbed, and any other synonym you can think of to describe the sheer pointlessness of this film. Far from being an intriguing character study, or even a modern day buddy movie/love story, it became too bogged down in the bourgeoisie attitudes displayed by Giamatti's character, Miles,which dulled the pace, and made the jokes feel very exclusive and insular. All Miles and Jack's little idiosyncrasies only serve to distance the audience from characters towards whom very few can relate. The only redeeming aspect of this movie is the cast, who admittedly put up a valiant effort to save this film from itself, but sadly fall by the wayside. All in all, it is two hours of my life, which I should very much like back.",Sideways
690,liyu01,flawed characters ultimately did this movie in,7,27 December 2004,"*minor spoiler alert* The recent buzz among critics about this movie lifted my expectation of this movie going in. The movie was beautifully shot in Santa Barbara wine country. The acting was also solid by a very good cast, but I was disappointed by the two main characters, who I really couldn't bring myself to care for.Jack, a TV/voice actor is a complete asshole, who is getting married in a week, but is out to screw any woman he sees. He is emotionally weak, dumb as rock and cares only getting into women's pants. He is so out there that he actually provides quite a bit of comical relief to the film. Miles, our middle age English teacher is a depressive wine lover, who starts the movie by stealing from his 70-something mother. We do get to see a more positive Miles during the movie, but the minute you had hopes up for Miles, he go thru his depress rage and pushes himself further into isolation than before. The saving grace is his engaging passion of wine, but how far can that really carry him? My answer would be not very far.",Sideways
691,mexican_waves,it takes someone really special to understand Sideways' potential,10,20 April 2007,"After reading so many negative comments from this completely amazing film, I felt I had to comment! Sideways is one of the most poignant, beautiful , heartbreaking and at the same time heartening films I have ever watched, whenever I watch it, I see something new, or I reach different interpretations from the events. For example, I hadn't realised (so much for my observation skills) that in the fast food restaurant, Miles is drinking the 1961 bottle he was saving for his tenth wedding anniversary. I was blown away! Whereas before this scene was so sad originally, and you could really feel how desolate Miles was feeling, when I realised it was that bottle, well, I nearly started crying, it just added a whole new dimension! I can only say how robbed Giametti was of an Oscar for this film, he was absolutely sublime, you really forget he was acting, he became Miles. OK so, he is a character on a downward spiral of depression, who steals money from his mother, but you can't help but completely understand his actions, or understand how he got to that point in this life. you can see how much he loathes himself. I was utterly captivated by him, it is an amazing, sublime piece of acting. same goes for all the other characters, although Giametti was simply outstanding. I could say so much more, but a lot has already been said! I have recommended this film to so many people already and I would recommend it to everyone on here to, I can't understand how anyone couldn't describe this film as anything but poignant and beautiful. it really struck a chord for me.",Sideways

694,rug_cakes,This movie should be seen and subsequently thrown away.,1,11 July 2005,"Firstly, I would like to precede my criticism with the note that I had no preconceptions of this film as any particular kind of comedy or that it would make me laugh, feel good about myself, et cetera. It seems many people didn't like this film because they picked it up for the wrong reasons (misadvertisement or a bad personal recommendation).It is obvious that this film could only be enjoyed by a certain portion of the U.S. populace, not on account of the film being set in the States, but because of the particular brand of stupidity which would probably baffle or disgust the rest of the world. The pathetic life of which I speak is a unique blend of no education or self-awareness, yet having pretensions to intelligence or wisdom, attempting to live 'better' but lacking the most basic level of discernment, assuming (wrongly) that the States and often just their own neighbourhood is as good as it gets. You can quickly see, I hope, that this blend goes nowhere. These bumbling, introverted, boringly unadventurous folk have become the source of 'comedy' in the U.S. recently. Another film of this type that springs to mind is Napolean Dynamite (which is worse than this film, believe it or not).The reason it should be seen is for the same reason I think Elephant should be seen, except that Sideways isn't deliberately trash in the way Elephant is the deliberate portrayal of the soulless. No. Sideways falls over impressively, being as pathetic as the characters in its story. The dialogue hints to something greater, like an insight into interpersonal relationships, the man-woman connection, the appreciation of culture, the understanding of one's own drives or the source of emotions. But it never quite manages to say anything. Just hints, like the screenwriter thought it would be nice to include all this Indie 'stuff', but really couldn't be bothered to think it through. So, Sideways is a victim of terrible, terrible writing. Anyone who thinks the dialogue in this is 'sharp' should get their head examined, for the repartee of the two hapless main characters is so slowly delivered, contrived and predictable that any socially adept person would fall asleep before getting to the reply. The reason for this predictability is that the social situations themselves are self-conscious to the point of absurdity, which is irrespective of how 'realistic' the movie is. This film tries, like the characters, too hard to be interesting, cool, wild, 'Indie', intelligent or wise and ends up being boring, crap, slow, idiotic and foolish.In short, this film indicates a new trend in cinema which is neither entertaining nor artistic, yet a sustainable market because of the large swathe of gullible, ignorant people who think it is the former, latter or both. It is something to avoid, but ensure you, your children, friends and siblings understand why. It is the Big Mac of intellectual film.",Sideways

Both Giamati and Church have proved themselves with this film. If they weren't noticed before, then they should be now. They somehow captured two walks of life so developed that at times I felt I wasn't even watching a movie. They are both tremendous actors.

696,lowmankind,"Straightforward, yet subtle for those willing to look between the lines",9,13 August 2007,"It's great to enter into a movie without knowing what is coming. Having a vague idea of the plot synopsis (Paul Giamati and Thomas Hayden-Church going on a tour of a vineyard for a week), Sideways gave continued delight and entertainment and, most importantly, surprise.My biggest fear going into Sideways was that it may be overly artistic, and although it's very gentle at the start, the film is actually quite straightforward, and for this reason alone, many will enjoy it. But if you're willing to keep an active mind, you will find layer upon layer of nuance and subtext -- there's more going on than what you're presented with. A particular delight is seeing how the characters will shock you, and credit must be given for the character development in this script. Just when you think you've got one of the protagonists figured out, new revelations are given. I'm screaming to discuss these, but this isn't a spoiler-review.Perhaps best of all is the sense of humour the film portrays. There are a number of scenes which would be right at home in a goofball comedy, yet to think like this is to merely consider the execution. It is in the setup to these gags that the film shows its strength, making the funny moments quite understandable, even though they're quite unexpected.And, of course, mention must be made of the acting. Giamati is superb, and his neuroses will alienate you until you suddenly feel a deep sympathy for the guy, even if you feel like giving him a wide berth. Thomas Hayden-Church will make you laugh and instill you with confidence, yet irritate you at the same time. These are two guys who, well, you will wonder why you'd want them as friends, but their interaction along this journey demands attention.There's no reason not to watch Sideways, just remember to keep your brain active.",Sideways

Seems like the fault of the director and not the cast. Why Wine tasting? Because a lot of yuppies love wine tasting and makes them feel distingushed among their peers.

Attempts at achieving pace through editing failed. The autobiographical aspects of the book and film hit home with folks outside my ken? I think so. Academy award nominations and an actual award? I think not. The bought and paid for reputation of the Academy presses on. Cannot take anything from the excellent performances by the fine cast. They just had so little to work with.

700,lotterdj,all you need is a (heterosexual) partner ...,2,18 August 2005,"I decided to watch this film for two reasons: First, many people around me were raving about it, and second, I had loved Payne's previous film ""About Schmid"". The latter film was truly honest, at times really comical, at times really tragic, and very philosophical. However, even though ""Sideways"" appears to be set along similar lines -- some not so successful middle aged white males searching for meaning in their lives -- I found almost nothing of the spirit of ""About Schmid"" in Payne's new film. It may be that my appreciation of ""About Schmid"" has intensified my disappointment with ""Sideways""; however, I might not even have watched the latter had I not known that it was made by the director of the former.Sorry to say, but ""Sideways"", in my view, is nothing but a teeny-style film for adults. Interestingly, in my experience, it is a teeny-style film that seems to be appreciated especially in academic circles. I wonder why. Is it the ""wine"" background of the story? Is it the main character who is presented as an attempting but unsuccessful novelist? Both are not very interesting. I personally do not like the taste of oak barrel, which is common to Californian wines, but much prefer good Italian wines. ""Sideways"" certainly hasn't made me appreciate Californian wine to the extent that ""Babette's Feast"" made me appreciate well-prepared and sophisticated meals.Again, what is intellectually interesting about someone who unsuccessfully tries to get a novel published if we hardly get to know anything about the novel itself? We learn only in the end -- through Maya's voice mail message -- that the content seems to be somehow autobiographical. Miles is obviously just a narcissist if he wants to publish an autobiographical novel about a not very interesting life and believes that it may be accepted. That by itself may not be decisive -- you do not need to be able to identify with the main characters or want to invite them over for dinner, as one reviewer pointed out. However, since the content of the novel does not become any issue in the film except as a means to secure Miles's love interest Maya, we are left with the general idea that the main motive to publish a novel is to be 'loved' by people and that there is not really much else to it. And this is not just what we think is Miles' own personal motive -- it's what the film itself tells us by not dwelling on the content of the book that he had written. Is that interesting? Otherwise, the film centers around Hollywood clichés about the nature of (white male upper middle class US-American) midlife crises; it never stops centering on sex and (heterosexual) love interests. There is nothing else; no politics, no philosophical reflections on life, no really interesting issues taken up. The only interesting character seems to be Maya -- but she is, like all younger women in the film -- reduced to a mere love interest. This is another strong message the film sends out: Young females are interesting only inasmuch as they are potential objects of sex or sexual love. Overall, the film reduces all our human problems to finding a suitable (hetero)sexual partner. Once you found one you'll be happy, and all the rest is unimportant.I was bored to death also by some ""comical"" scenes like the one in which Miles grabs Jack's wallet from the waitress's home in the middle of her having sexual intercourse with her husband -- this is pure teenager stuff, sorry! And seeing Bush and Rumsfeld on the TV screen in the background during that event does not add any more wit to that scene, or to the film in general, for that matter...Finally, we do not only not understand what actually keeps the two male buddies together, apart from the mere fact that they had been 'freshmen roommates at San Diego State', but we understand even less what keeps the two female 'best friends' together. Do we ever see them being engaged in a conversation? We know they must talk to each other, otherwise the plot wouldn't have worked out (i.e., when Maya tells Jennifer about Jack's upcoming marriage). However, all we get to know about their conversations is that they are just about guys... But at the same time we are encouraged to think that Maya is somehow intellectually interested and smart.Whoever finds this film realistic must live in a very shallow culture and know nothing else. To be sure, I do not mind if films are unrealistic. However, I do mind if a film gets overrated that bores one to death with cheap Hollywood clichés while at the same time trying -- and apparently succeeding -- to appeal to large crowds of people who think of themselves as educated and progressive.",Sideways

One guy is a manic-depressive and the other is a stereotypical sidekick who provides the punchline when the film needs it. There were nothing special and it didn't have anything new I haven't seen before. A lack of a good score didn't help the film much either. At some sequences the editing and camera work looks as if it were done by some recent film school graduate. It is different, but different doesn't necessarily make it good.

It's one of those marvelous films I want to always remember. Sideways is one of the defining films for me this year. It's to be enjoyed by discerning tasters.",Sideways
705,droogiedeuce,You call this a movie?!,2,7 July 2005,"A movie is to supply a way of escapism and entertainment. This movie provided neither! If you are a wino yuppie, this movie is for you, but for the rest of us normal people, this movie is crap, waste of time, toilet flush. The only good stuff were a few parts when Mr. Yuppie (main character, what's-his-face) is drinking and does stupid crap...why? Because seeing yuppies do stupid stuff when they're drinking their wine is funny. There were two parts I can think of, which lasted about 10 seconds of this four hour movie. Wait, maybe it wasn't that long, but it seemed like an eternity for the credits to finally roll up. Why is it on the top 250?! I am disappointed with you people! This movie sucked, end of story, don't see it.",Sideways
706,Paper-Street,I give it two wine bottles up!,10,31 December 2004,"Paul Giamatti, who is soon proving that he is a film dynamo if you will, gives a wonderfully depressing but lovable performance in this one of the years best films, Sideways, an adaptation of the Rex Pickett novel of the same title. It follows Miles {Giamatti), a divorced, unemployed writer/wine connoisseur, who goes on a week long Californian wine tour with his good friend Jack (Haden Church), who is getting married at the end of this road trip. Along the way, they test and tie up the bonds of friendship, and finding love along the way {Virginia Madsen and Sandra Oh).Miles is, as said, a wine snob, but this is pretty much just a glorified way of saying he has a drinking problem, as he drinks heavily along the way on this trip, as a way of soothing himself with the thought of being unemployed, divorced, broke, and being a starving writer.The title, which seems to confuse most, is reference to tipping a glass of wine sideways to check for age and imperfections.As said, this is one of the finest films of the year, and a tour de force performance on both Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church's part. I recommend this film to anyone who loves movies.",Sideways

Surprisingly hilarious and every bit as good as the critics are saying, the four actors create a chemistry that I haven't seen for a long time. Those who find it boring and quote ""about losers"" end-quote, should go back to The Grudge and Team America (and they say Sideways makes cheap shots?) and whatever pap floats their boat. Several critics level charges against Payne of character assassination (try Charles Taylor's review for Salon). I could not disagree more. Are there a few cheap set-ups (the overweight hostess and her bucking bronco husband, which is hilarious but yeah, not exactly subtle)? Yes. Critical to the movie? Probably. That cheap set-up, for instance, gives Miles (Giamatti) his first opportunity to flex a long dormant backbone. If you didn't get Election, you might not get Sideways either. A return to form.",Sideways
710,mailbox13,An interesting failure,6,14 January 2005,"This film is certainly unusual in its structure, though I would be reluctant to call the experiment successful. At many points, the script and cinematography lack subtlety almost to the point of being painful. Perhaps this was an attempt at self-deprecating humour, but it didn't work for me, the film was just a little to earnest for that.The more overtly comedic moments vary -- some are genuinely funny while others have a back-to-high-school flavour that suggests nothing so much as a Hollywood studio making adjustments to the script.Sideways rambles oddly through its 123 minutes. In that time, it develops only two and half characters. Miles and Jack are both implausible caricatures. Their respectively wine- and sex- soaked mid-life crises inspire little sympathy. The metaphors in their relationship had potential but the execution is just a little too schmaltzy and the more asinine attempts at humour clash embarrassingly. Parallels between Miles' book, the structure of a complex wine and the plot of the film itself are momentarily amusing but that's it.The best thing I can say about this film is that its failure stood out sufficiently to motivate me to write this review. Perhaps my palette is not yet sufficiently discerning.",Sideways
711,choffman-1,Annoyingly boring ...,4,18 April 2005,"Although I rented Sideways with great anticipation, it was a huge disappointment. Mostly I was bored; ultimately I was annoyed. Cinematic ally, it was a success -- great character development, good acting, wonderful writing. The women, in particular, were fabulous -- strong, competent, real, in control of their lives, interesting.There were maybe 4 laugh-out-loud moments, and they were great. But the men just did not measure up. Of the two, I liked Miles better, but I found it hard to believe that he and Jack had been lifelong friends -- they seemed to have virtually nothing in common. More problematical, however, for me, was the Jack character -- yet another man who thinks it's OK to cheat and lie and use whatever he needs in order to feed his own ego. And everything suffers: a friendship that is more a habit than a thing of value; a marriage that happens despite the shallowness of Jack's pathetic life; and a momentary insight (not very convincingly acted) that gets whisked away by Miles' agreeing, yet again, to rescue Jack from his own sophomoric idiocy.By the end of the movie, Miles does indeed evolve, symbolized by the knock on Maya's door. Jack doesn't, for he is not made to confront his mistakes, his lies, his stupidity in any way that nurtures growth. Instead, he gets pretty much everything he wants, while everyone around him has paid a price in one way or another. Had there been something else to his persona that lifted him out of the mundane, perhaps this character might have been more cinematic ally palatable. But ultimately there was absolutely nothing there to latch on to, and the good qualities in this film were not good enough to overcome the negative and the boring.",Sideways
712,nlfasciano,Why does everyone love this movie so much?,4,15 January 2005,"I read the reviews for this film shortly before I saw it, and I was led to believe that I would get a funny, charming, and altogether worthwhile film. What I got was an agonizingly predictable and somewhat dull piece of cinema that did not deliver the promised profound insight. Now, I left this movie with the impression that I had missed something. After thinking about it, however, I have come to the very strong conclusion that I did not miss anything, it just seemed that way because of the forced contemplative tone of the movie. This being the case with me, I am forced to suspect that because this movie got so much praise, a good many people like me who would have simply thought ""I must have missed something"", may have without realizing it let all that was said about the film take the place of what they would have really thought themselves. I can understand that some might be able to relate to the characters a little bit, but people it just was not that good.",Sideways

I kept waiting for something to happen and nothing ever did. The jokes were corny so I spent much of the movie in the hall waiting for it to end.

Some of the scenes are extremely amusing and the whole movie provides a feeling of warmth and comradeship through-out. Although this was not high on my list of films to see, and in fact it was serendipitous that I saw this movie, I would heartily recommend it. At the beginning of the movie I found it difficult to empathise with the rather self-absorbed Miles with his depressive mental states, but as the film unraveled I found my self drawn to this gentle individual with a taste for fine wine and the ability to demonstrate substantial moral fortitude. See it with a close friend, it will not disappoint.",Sideways

A fraud. Cringing and aggressively mediocre, this is a cesspool of Merlot backwash. Washed out wide-angle shots, a spastic splatter of split-screen cinematography, and softly-lit montages (combined with an oh-so-subtle score) cannot mask the overarching staleness and in fact, outright ickiniess, of its overgrown boys' club slapstick and sadsack under-appreciated artist routine.

717,gwandpc,This film is misogynist in the worst way,1,25 November 2004,"This movie exhibits the worst kind of misogyny: the subtle, secretive kind where if you're not paying attention, you might not even figure out just how much the characters (and the writers and directors) hate women.Jack's character is played for laughs and sympathy; we're supposed to identify with him when we're not chuckling along with him in a ""boys-will-be-boys"" way, never mind the fact that his character is a brutal womanizer and a disgusting cheat. It's not that his character is so awful to women that makes this movie misogynist, it's the fact that the audience is supposed to identify with him and completely disregard the feelings of the women he abuses (not that we're even shown how they feel about it). The best (and only just) point in this movie is when Stephanie beats the crap out of him, and yet this scene is supposed to be humorous and it writes Stephanie completely out of the movie. After that, the film and everyone in it dismiss her just as quickly as Jack does.But the absolute WORST thing about this film is what solidifies how misogynist it is: the women in the film exist only and for no other purpose than to solidify the bonds between the men (and that's basically the definition of patriarchy). When it's convenient for Jack and Myles, Stephanie and Maya are great friends who seem to have a lot of history together. But this film hates women so much that their friendship is nothing more than an accessory for Jack and Myles, just like the two women come to exist only in terms of what they can do for the men. Then, when Myles needs Maya to further affirm his self and identity (not that he deserves it), Maya betrays herself and Stephanie by acting only in relation to Myles.If the people who wrote and directed this film cared about women as people rather than as man-helpers, Maya and Stephanie's convenient friendship would have enough substance for Maya to utterly reject Myles in solidarity with Stephanie. But no, this film doesn't care about women and so the audience isn't supposed to wonder how exactly Maya and Stephanie are supposed to maintain their friendship while Maya reaches out to Myles. The film actually asks us to believe that Stephanie might end up hanging out with Maya and Myles, a man who let his friend utterly abuse her. Or wait, the film doesn't ask us to believe that, because it doesn't even take the time to consider what the consequences of Maya and Myles getting together might be. And why's that? Because Maya is not a whole, articulated person. She, like all the other women in the film, only exists in terms of the men around her.Because this film is so sly about its woman-hating agenda, it's possible to watch it as only an affirming look at the lives of two men. But the minute you ask yourself at what cost their lives come, you'll see at what level this film is truly operating.",Sideways

Maybe it appeals to a certain age group but as a person who would happy sit and watch two characters sit in a room and talk for two hours IF they were interesting, even i can say 'warch this movie' and mean it. Don't believe the people how say this is 'hilarious' though. They are lying to you.

719,MikeLPistonsfan,I think I know why so many people dislike this film,8,29 January 2005,"I think I see why there are quite a few people who do not like this film. Let me start by saying that I, by no means, think it is a bad film. On the contrary, I think it is quite good. HOWEVER, I do NOT think it is the best film of the year...or even ONE OF the best. And furthermore, I think it would be a travesty if this film wins Best Picture. 2 of my favorite movies of the year didn't even get Best Picture nominations (Eternal Sunshine... and Hotel Rwanda. How Finding Neverland got Hotel Rwanda's rightful spot is beyond me.) ANYWAY, the things about this film that I think make it not ""work"" for people are not necessarily flaws, but just things that would have been easily overlooked if the film were not hyped so much. First of all, it IS terribly cliché and predictable. An example is when Miles are Jack are first leaving for the trip and Miles asks Jack how he likes the book. Jack says he likes it a lot (more or less) and Miles asks him how he liked the new ending, then Jack proceeded to praise it. Did ANYONE ALIVE not know that there was no change in the ending and that it was just a trick? How many THOUSANDS of movies has that happened in? Was that supposed to be funny? I think the only person who would have been amused by that is someone who'd never seen a movie before. Also, like one person said (someone who was wrongly attacked), this film does seem like a more mature and grown-up version of the American Pie movies...without the vulgar jokes and excessive foul language. Here are some similarities between both films: You got a guy who's awkward with women, has a hot chick that he could be with, and blows the opportunity (several times). You got the concept of someone not being ready for marriage. You got a guy who is on a quest to get laid. You got a road trip. Delightful misunderstandings. You got a pact between friends to get laid...it's all there. This is just the more sophisticated version...with wine.I don't think that age has very much to do with whether or not someone will like this film...or whether or not someone will ""get"" it. (I hate when people say that.) I think the reason that critics, as well as all of the older people who claim that you need life experience in order to ""get it,"" liked this film because of how much they can relate to Miles. Think about it (for those of you who are film writers, critics, or students), how many of you have met, or happen to be, just like Miles? How many film critics do you think can relate to a slightly overweight, balding, middle-aged pathetic guy who feels like he's wasted his life and never gets laid? lol I think a lot of them. They see themselves in Miles and feel for him in his situation and, when he finally scores with Maya (after some PATHETIC wasted opportunities), they feel like he's scored one for them too.Like I said in the beginning though: not a bad film. It's extremely well-done and well-acted, and that's what stops these flaws from hurting it. If it were not for all the hype, I think a lot more people would like it. I'd still recommend it, but I can run off SEVERAL movies this year that I felt were better.",Sideways

I got kinda bored during the wine lectures but I gained some knowledge. Being a great fan of Thomas Haden Church (Jack) in the Ned & Stacey TV series, made me really enjoy his character that is somewhat similar to the Ned Dorsey character in the series. All the actors were great. There was a hint of underacting in Paul Giamatti's (Miles) performance at some parts. The first hour of the movie isn't really interesting. It feels more like a series of unrelated events, no buildup and very slow. A lot of time is wasted introducing wine rather than the two main characters!",Sideways
722,a_franklin,A Bad Movie for People Who Don't Know Any Better But Think That They Do,1,8 January 2005,"The one great redeeming quality of this movie is its philosophical consistency. It's about a middle-aged man who has populated his life with pretensions - that he is a writer, an epicure, and an expert on wine. This movie will appeal exclusively to those with an all-too common and all-too-similar conceit: that they ""appreciate good movies."" Sideways is a brilliantly acted, brilliantly polished turd. The direction and editing is superb, the acting is magnificent and the characters have both depth and realism.BUT THE MOVIE SUCKS.In fact, it prides itself on its sucking. Our protagonists are a pathetic and self-pitying (though utterly self-absorbed) writer-aesthete wannabe and an unsuccessful TV actor whose stated purpose is to cheat on his fiancée as often as possible in the week before his wedding. These characters are drawn with subtlety and artistry, and both actors turn in bravura performances, but when all's said and done it's impossible to give the proverbial rodent's behind about either of them. If the film had concluded with every major character dying painfully, the emotional impact would have been a nice round zero.To enjoy this movie you have to identify with the main character Miles, and to identify with Miles you have to have a smug self-pitying streak a mile wide. Let me make something absolutely clear: MILES IS NOT TALENTED. That the director would choose to betray the preceding seven hours at the very end by making Maya (as uninteresting a love interest as I can imagine) appreciate his behemoth of a novel is neither here nor there - Miles is not a good writer, or a good anything. If you've never written a novel, you might think that Miles is what a writer is like. If you have, you know that he's a talentless hack.I repeat, it's only the MOVIE that is bad. The acting is excellent; except for Madsen's pale and boring millstone of a character, everybody shows up and turns in a good show. But the movie itself is really, really awful.Not funny.Not romantic.Not charming.Sideways manages to be both contemptuous and contemptible, small and small-minded. I won't bother enumerating the many, many ways in which this movie shows its contempt for anybody who isn't a lifeless oenophile.I walked into Sideways thinking I was going to love it.

Now if there is one movie you should try to see this year it is Sideways. Not only did it have a serious theme (wine) it also added a lot of comedy to keep you from dozing off.

Alexander Payne is one of the finest directors working today and one of the rare few who actually possesses true integrity. He sought not the biggest named stars (George Clooney wanted in on this movie and Payne turned him down because he wasn't right for the role!), but rather the best actors suited for these characters. Paul Giamatti, Thomas Haden Church, Virginia Madsen and Sandra Oh are all excellent in this film and deliver Oscarworthy performances, in my opinion. The natural chemistry between the 4 main actors and the smooth flow of the movie made me sad to see it end. While hilarious in parts, there were many scenes that downright moved me and made me love the sometimes unlikable lead male characters.

Maybe I'm right in the target audience but the relationship of Miles and Jack were superb. Of course the wallet scene and Miles face is an all time classic. But it was the subtle facial expressions and the longing for something deeper in life. Miles distance in his eyes when Mya is talking about the grapes. That was top notch.

There was a great feeling I got from this film when i finished viewing it and i feel that everyone else who has commented positively on this would have felt the same. In fact the feeling left at the end of the film is positive, which would seem strange as the film is all about a negative person named, ""Miles"" played by Paul Giamatti, who is, i feel, a very underrated actor.The relationship between Miles and his best friend Jack, played by Thomas Haden Church, is fantastic they have a brilliant relationship throughout the entire film and that is what really turns him from his negative side.This is one of Alexander Payne's best pictures and if you have seen and liked it then i would definitely give this title a try.",Sideways

You only have limited options in this world and when you're in a mid-life crisis there's so little possibility you'd still be able to make it until you discover the bottled living thing we call wine.Two middle-aged unsuccessful men Miles (Paul Giamatti) and Jack (Thomas Haden Church) make their trip of a lifetime. Miles is your typical English teacher whose career in writing has been on the dumps and just got divorced. Jack is the ex- ""boy next door"" actor whose acting career is nearing the dumps and will make the trip of his lifetime seven days before he marry a rich Armenian girl that will save him from a rusting Hollywood career.The two of them flood the Wine Country of Southern California and while Jack digs the vineyard to get laid and have fun with sexy Steph (Sandra Oh) who will kick his butt at the end, Miles take his moment and is torn between finding himself in his past failed marriage or falling prey into a new life in the eyes of a beautiful waitress named Maya (Virginia Madsen).I watched Sideways alone and counted how many people walked out of the theatre at the first half of the movie-and I'm relieved that they're not close to five unlike my experience with 2046 where you hear people whisper ""It doesn't matter if you finish this, there's no story into it."" Which will help you manage a seatback and enjoy because even if the theatre is not even half filled, you can hear the patrons laughing at every sarcastic joke. Although technical aspects like editing and cinematography are slightly below the ground, and the fact that this is an Independent film explains it all and everybody becomes patient even if the unparallel musical scoring gets worse at the climax.Sideways is a story of realizing just what have you done with your life and what will you do about it. It's about messing up the most part but getting the ending come clean. And it doesn't matter if you waited for so many years before you realize that there's still hope for your life even if the only woman you love had just remarried and the novel you've written had been rejected so many times that it is fortunate enough to have a waitress dwell some interest on it. All of the mess will scatter in front of you but you don't really have to bother because at the end of it, you tend to compare your life with wine.

The characters are perfectly seeded for each other, but the script and character development are lacking overall, which proves to be a waste of acting talent. Thomas Hayden Church delivers a phenomenal performance in his role, as does Virginia Madsen. Again, the script lacks that certain aspect needed to make an okay movie great. If it were not for the acting performances in this film, I would have put it in the same category as Gigli and other movies of the type. Another point of the movie which proves to be difficult to tie to is the whole wine connection itself. The movie's dialogue relied on wine too much to create the connect-ability this movie needed. The direction of the movie itself was beautiful, with the serene vineyards and the stunning breathtaking scenery, but this still was just not enough to carry the movie to the memorable status many make it sound like. Payne, in my opinion, needs to stick to his quasi-satirical style rather than mess around with the ""how humans do"" motif. If you are expecting a Payne movie such as Citizen Ruth or Election you are going to be disappointed (as was I). Perhaps you should just rent Closer instead",Sideways

Paul Giamatti, Thomas Haden Church, Virginia Madsen (who I was personally glad to see again) and Sandra Oh are all deserving of, at least, Golden Globes.

Sure the acting may be good and it may be well written and well directed and all that nonsense, but great galloping gourmets, a comedy? I suspect that those who decide such things were grasping for a classification. I think one could count the comedic scenes on one hand, not including the thumb and it was a struggle to find something laughable in most of those. Of course if you are into laughing at someone with major clinical depression, you might enjoy it more than I. The storyline is thin and the budget was obviously thinner. The tale takes it's sweet time unwinding and spends more than half of it's allotted time getting to anything remotely close to a point. The only redemption at all is saved for the last three minutes of film and then it fades to black, if indeed it could get any blacker, before you get a chance to recover from the doom and gloom with some semblance of a happy ending. As for the illusive classification? How about morosity (yes I know that suffix doesn't belong) or better yet, morbidity? Why do I sit through these type of films? It's like a bad accident. It's so horrible that you can't bring yourself to look away.",Sideways

You can split the demographic of 18-45 year old American males right down the middle. Either you're a Jack, or you're a Miles. Two polar opposites, neither of whom truly understands the other, yet they remain the best of friends. If you're a Jack, you do without thinking, you're only reality is what's immediately in front of you, and you fall ass-backwards into instant gratification wherever you go. If you're a Miles, you see disaster in front of you at every step, and you believe failure is inevitable, so why even put forth the effort on the minuscule chance that something good will happen? You think it's better to be complacent and at least not risk having your self esteem drop even further with failure.The characters are just so real and piercing that you identify with every moment of their on-screen lives, and every nuance, every facial expression, is something you've seen before in your own life.

The men are supposedly friends yet don't understand each other. They are self-absorbed and their attempts to communicate usually fail. As the movie drags on, the 'friendship' becomes less and less credible. The 2 men meet 2 women and have a few double dates. In scenes that show the couples getting together and forming relationships, the dialog is mostly shallow or missing. The viewer gets to see the couples together without hearing what they are saying. In comparison to the men, the women seem to be saints, although we don't learn much about them. There are enough laughs to fill a preview but not enough to carry the movie.",Sideways

Giamatti plays a sensitive recently divorced nerd who aspires to be a novelist. His failed manuscript fills two reams of paper. Church's character is a C-list actor on the verge of marriage, but he's a moronic loudmouth who wants to bed down every woman he sees. No way in the world could I buy the premise that these two guys are buddies from way back. While on their trip through California's wine-growing country, they meet three women, and with predictable results.

If you've ever felt hopeless, pathetic and weak, you will recognize this character and loathe yourself for it. Beautiful in ways, but way too real, this is escape fiction in the sense that after it is over the rest of your life is a happy escape from the life of this poor man. The Thomas Hayden Church character is a direct contrast to the main character, Church plays an over-confident aging actor with no remorse except for the women he fails to have sex with. The main character is a pseudo-intellectual highbrow with nothing but remorse, remorse for the sins, mistakes and faux pas he has committed and a generous portion of remorse for the actions of everyone else. His guilty conscience is extreme. The movie is terrific in many ways, but it isn't fun, it drags and makes you feel certain emotions that are uncomfortable and not in line with a carefree night at the movies.",Sideways

He was asleep, but let me tell you, I left a stinging message. To start, it had no idea what it was all about.

Paul Giamatti as Miles and Thomas Haden Church as Jack put forth stellar performances. One can never truly feel sympathy for the sulking, divorced Miles.

Unfortunately it was flagrantly bad, third rate elevator jazz and incredibly annoying. As if that wasn't enough, they absolutely never stopped playing it! Dialogue going on? Hey, let's keep the bad music going over it. That's indicative of a director who doesn't have confidence in his material (and he shouldn't have, since there was nothing resembling a story or interesting dialogue). It ruined some of the few bits that would have been funny - for instance, I would've laughed at the scene where he was running through the field chugging the wine, but just couldn't with that awful soundtrack going.There were also some ridiculous montage scenes of them driving through the country. That's an editing move that always lets you know you're watching a very bad movie, usually reserved for tepid Hollywood romantic comedies.And let's not forget Virginia Madsen's monologued answer to the silly, pretentious 'So, how'd you get into wine' question. I can't remember the details ... suffice it to say my date and I were squirming with laughter more and more as it went on. And then the final line - she shoots him a provocative look and ends with 'And it tastes so f*ing good'. Oh my god, we just burst into hysterics.That was hands down the worst scene I've seen in any movie since the sex scene between Keanu Reeves and Carrie Moss in Matrix Reloaded.Wow.

We have seen this scenario in many of his films, but done better and with more humor. It is the California wine country instead of New York City, but the neurotic lead character remains the same.

745,malmsey1955,Sideways,10,26 December 2004,"WARNING! I have revealed several ""punch-lines"". For some not use to activating their own imagination and feelings, this movie may seem unworthy of such great praise; I hope to enlighten. Malmsey There are numerous reasons to recommend this hilarious and mildly dark comedy, Sideways. Fabulous direction, flawless script, dynamic pairing of characters, no frills, just pure human drama, brilliant direction, unique cinematography, the cast and best of all, this low-budget film is the antithesis of the Hollywood fanfare. A remarkable genre and change of pace from the typical movie standard.Sideways is based on Rex Pickett's novel of the same title. By the way, the book is a metrical entity of humor in it's own right; a must read! Sideways as presented in the book, means ""tipsy""; to stumble and fall just as we do in life. The magnitude of this cliché is reinforced in a scene when the main character Miles is leaving a bar inebriated; dawdling he is almost too ""tipsy"" to walk. Along with Miles (Paul Giammitti), there is Jack played by Thomas Hayden Church, Maya who becomes Miles love interest (Virginia Madsen), and Stephanie (Sandra Ho). Alexander Payne is the director and collaborated on the screenplay with his partner Jim Taylor. Together they formulate a brilliance not seen since Alan Alda.The plot is meticulously unveiled through a series of metaphors and ingenious split screen montages; which means the director capitalizes on the usage of his ""artist license"" and we the viewer must select how much or how little we want to evolve ourselves in the interpretation process. Miles and Jack are old college buddies. Together they take a road trip through the Cailfornia wine country. The pair are in perfect harmony as they yin and yang each other through life in a contrasting synchronousness, much like ""The Odd Couple"". The ""migratory"" execration is a week long fling of drinking, golf, bonding, and sexual encounters of a perfidious nature serving to mourn the ""loss of Jack"" to his impending marriage at the end of the week.Miles is a deeply anguished and forlorn divorced middle-aged school teacher who is neurotic, depressed, in a rut, as well as a failed novelist. Jack is a fun lovin' has been actor without self-restraints and is often victimized by his own adolescent primal behaviors. Maya is a warm-hearted subtle yet mesmerizing waitress who is working her way through college and wants a permanent relationship. Stephanie is a single mother with a free spirited persona, but she is not without conviction and dignity. The twosome not only bring to the screen the neglected male viewpoints of life's's challenges but the universal milestones of life that queries ""What is the meaning of life?"" At one point in the movie, Miles informs Jack, ""you can examine wine by the turning the glass sideways...checking for age and impurities."" The characters through a series of ""paniced"" escapades, also gauge their maturity and face their ""own"" impurities. The unpredictable plot continues to manifest itself throughout the film with more metaphorical wine tastings analogies. The storyline is encoded in the parody of the ""posh"" absurdities of being an oenophile. (One who is a wine connoisseur.) At one point, we realize Miles is incapable of shedding himself from the persona a fragile Pinot Noir or the swirling of wine or the sloshing of life's tribulations.(tipsy) The bottle of 1961 Château Blanc, should have received its very ""own"" credit as it made a significant contribution to pivotal turning points.There are many whimsical one liners. One of my favorites is when the very ""tipsy"" Miles returns from a pay phone after calling his ex-wife and Jack asks him ""Did he drink and dial?"" Another is when the duo are about to enter a restaurant to meet their perspective dates and Miles pulls Jack off to the side to tell him, ""If they order merlot, we're leaving"". Merlot is often a pretentious attempt to appear ""posh""; there is nothing ""posh"" or savory about Caifornia merlots. This brings us to the only negative in the movie. Many of the punch lines are regional or twisted in oenophile jargon. A good example of this is when Miles says reminiscently, ""We had a 95 Opus. One with smoked salmon and artichokes, but we didn't care."" Even if you don't know the taboo pairing of wine and food, we can recognize the profound obsession of this oenophile. It is here we laugh at the macabre psychosis of dark comedy and find our disdain or uneasiness with this character to begin take hold.Paul Giammatti is a gifted clonal mimic of Christopher Walken and Dustin Hoffman. The drollness of his dry but witty low-brow humor is crafted to a tempo of pure perfection. If you are a fan of Giammatti, he will be in three more pictures in 2005 and two in 2006. Some may not like the odd polarity of Paul Giammatti and Virginia Macden, but they have a wonderful chemistry! Don't forget that Woody Allen and Diane Keaton where a magnificent duo of the same properties.I will close by saying, I believe Alexander Payne to be the next Woody Allen, but with more Oscars!",Sideways

Cinematography and direction splendid; paced and framed with such tact.

747,shumway3000,a drama with heart and laughter,9,6 March 2005,"I first heard about this film from a coming attraction earlier in the year. I didn't expect it to be good or bad at the time. It looked like your average buddy picture. When it started to get hype for an Oscar, I was worried that it wouldn't meet up to expectations and would just be another over hyped movie to just get an Oscar. I waited until after the awards to see it. I didn't want to see it just to be part of the hype. Since it just won a screen writing award, I figured that it must be pretty good. The other film to win a writing award is my favorite movie of the year, Eternal Sunshine of the spotless mind.Sideways was more than a buddy movie. It was about two friends going out and having a good time and finding romance along the way. Sideways was primarily about a divorced man in his 30's or 40's who is trying to figure things out. He is employed as an 8th grade English teacher who writes novels in his spare time. For Miles, he goes on a trip to get away from things and wait out hearing about his novel. For his friend, he is on a quest to live things up before he gets married.Sideways is on the surface a pretentious film that talks about wine taste most of the time, but it is more a picture about love and it's disappointments. The characters are trying to find their right match but eventually end up getting hurt in the process. The character of Miles plays things safe most of the time because he doesn't want to get hurt again after thinking he had the right one.The best thing about this film was the casting. Giamatti was great in it. Not as good as American Splendor, but he brought the right tone to the character and what he was feeling. The best performance in the film was by Thomas Hayden Church. Church hasn't been seen much since Wings or Ned and Stacey, but he shows in Sideways that he can play both comedy and drama. He was the perfect opposite to Giamatti's negative depression.Virginia Madsen was another ray of sunshine in the film. The only problem with her performance was that there wasn't enough of it.Giamatti stated in 'American Splendor' that ""real life is pretty complex stuff"". In Sideways, we see that things aren't always as easy as they seem, but you must keep going with your problems and try to do the right thing as best as you can. In the end, no one changes who they are, but become stronger from the experiences they went through.",Sideways

749,jerburns-1,"Sideways  a good vintage, but not one that will age well.",8,6 January 2005,"To be sure Sideways is an enjoyable film, but Oscar-worthy? Not in my book. Despite its promise, humor, and winning acting, from an artistic standpoint the film comes up short. In fact, in some ways I rank it below Swingers (1996), a similar film, but one that at least has a proper denouement. Here's how: Most of the film introduces the audience to the protagonist, Miles Raymond (Paul Giamatti) who we come to understand as charmingly pathetic; a blocked writer still in love with his wife who is about to remarry. Miles sets out on his quest to show Jack (Thomas Haden Church) a good time before the latter's wedding; the quest reveals how deeply both characters are flawed. Miles is shown stealing money from his own mother! Tension in the film builds as Miles and Jack's exploits unfurl in Central California's wine country. They meet women, have a good time and take steps towards facing their demons.The film leaves Jack not far from where we find him. In three years, if that much he will be divorced. Then, writer Rex Pickett can write about Jack's emotional reconstitution.We cannot leave Miles similarly flawed. The work of this movie is to force him to confront himself. And here's where the film goes awry.Though the audience is shown that he has confronted himself, seen his flaws, and changed for the better, we never actually see, on the big screen, when that confrontation took place. Missed opportunities abound: in the final sequences with his new girlfriend Maya (Virginia Madsen), with Jack, or with his ex-wife at Jack's wedding. The film missed this crucial scene.I, for one, feel Miles' transformation somehow happened off-screen. His emotional ""uncorking"" never really transpired in an emotionally true manner. By contrast, to name a few of my favorites, think of the emotional climax of Maurice Purley in Mike Leigh's Secrets and Lies (1996), or of Robert Redford, confronted by Laura Fischer, in Sidney Lumet's The Verdict. These scenes cut to the bone; we understand how these flawed characters change because we witness the conflict and its resolution. Sideways, by contrast, fizzles like yesterday's Korbel left open. That is does is all the more disappointing because it had so much going for it.Even the aforementioned Swingers, a film very close in style to Sideways, gets it. In Swingers, we follow Jon Favreau's Mike Peters, another emotionally blocked character, and Trent Walker (Vince Vaughn) on humorous exploits that force Favreau's character to begin living his life again. But in Swingers, Doug Liman actually shows us the moment where Peters changes: swinging on the dance floor. Sideways is a rich-man's Swingers but lacks the one critical ingredient that would have made it great: a unmistakable scene in which Miles comes uncorked.",Sideways
750,cameltoes,good endings,8,7 January 2005,"I think that there is a real lack of good endings in Hollywood movies today. When I say good, I mean endings that are trying to do more than simply relieve the audience of suspense/anxiety or endings that only serve to add sentimentality to the story. I mean endings that don't try to smudge reality and tie the movie into a pretty bow. I'm not saying that I'm against happy endings because I'm not. I think Sideways has one of the most happy, life-affirming endings that I've seen in a while, but because it leaves the reader thinking about life, it achieves something greater than most movies. As sad as this is I found myself actually hoping that after the last knock on the door the director didn't feel the need to cut to a ""one year later"" scene or a montage of pictures of the characters explaining what they go on to do in the future. It doesn't speak well for the movie industry that I have to hope that the director doesn't ruin the movie at the end because so many movies today do lose any chance they have at the end. Basically, what I'm saying is Hollywood needs to learn to respect the audience. It's okay to let us think about the meaning of things. You don't have to package it up in clichés for it to be a success. Movies can be great entertainment but some are works of art. Sideways is art because the audience leaves the theater thinking about life. That's the kind of movie I want to pay seven bucks to see.",Sideways

Two Gorgeous women that are great actresses ! I love the flow of the movie. Thomas Haden Church and Paul Giamatti work well together during their search to make meaning of mid life uncertainties. The most amazing aspect of this movie is the fact that Paul Giamatti did not get the Oscar nomination for Best Actor. He was incredible in this role and he is one of America's best actors.

753,zsublimez69,Mighty Fine Wine,10,11 January 2005,"""Sideways"" is one of the best films I have seen all year. Alexander Payne did a great job of adapting the book into a movie. The cast is well assembled with Paul Giamatti as the ever depressed character Miles, whose book is never going to get published. Also adding that Miles'wife just left him gives the character the reason to go in and out of depression throughout the whole movie. Thomas Haden Church (yes the guy from ""Wings"") gives a performance of a lifetime which will most likely give him Oscar Gold and the much needed career boost. Church plays Jack. Jack is a has been actor who never got past playing a doctor in a soap opera, which makes for a very funny part in the movie. He also is getting married, now the premise of the movie is for Miles and Jack, the two were college roommates, to go on one last adventure before Jack gets married. So they head for Northern California for a week of golf and wine tasting. Now Miles is a calm but also paranoid person who is also trying to get out of the depression that haunts him in the movie. Jack is the typical dumb character that often make movies become stupid pieces of trash and will do anything to get a cheap laugh. In this movie Alexander Payne makes sure that Jack doesn't get lumped into that stereotype by making his stupidity smart and funny instead of lame and stupid. Thomas Haden Church also plays this character to perfection. While they are wine tasting the two characters meet two girls. Maya(Virginia Madsen) is the love interest of Miles and Stephanie(Sandrah Oh) who is Jack's love interest and together all four of these characters mesh well. Things get complicated whenever Stephanie finds out that Jack is getting married which ruins Miles' chance to find a new love in Maya. The rest I am not going to give away because everyone should be required to see this movie because it is a perfect movie: it is hysterically funny and also very depressing, but not to depressing to where you walk out of the movie and think about killing yourself, it is depressing in a real life sort of way. The movie just shows how a man can be depressed over little things. Anyways this movie has Oscar written all over it. Thomas Haden Church is going to win Best Supporting Actor while Virginia Madsen takes the Best Supporting Actress, and if it wasn't for Jaimee Fox's stellar performance in ""Ray"" then Paul Giamatti would be winning this award. Alexander Payne might have a hard time winning in the Best Adapted Screenplay category being nominated against Charlie Kaufmann. Best Picture is also going to go to this movie. All in all the movie is great and everyone should see it",Sideways
754,huckleberryduck,mediocre middle-aged indie film,5,15 January 2005,"Sideways is a film that deals with a depressed English teacher, miles, his failing life, and his attempts at showing his longtime buddy, jack a good time before his wedding. His own self doubt and alcoholism/drinking/depression start spoiling Jack's last Hoorah before he gets hitched. The pairing of the two seems all to easy for a film, a modest loser and his friend the confident-but-doesn't-realize-he-is-a -loser, loser who is more aggressive with life. this creates a ""funny"" premise to exploit the comedy in the film in which Jack pressures the insecure and reluctant miles to hook-up with women and adopt his brash and adventurous attitude towards life. Miles is in essence too timid and broken-hearted divorcée who couldn't hack it with love. He is the cliché depressed writer ( who also couldn't hack it the industry, working as a teacher instead of writing top selling novels, which recalls that old phrase: those that can, do, those that can't teach), and it indulges this in making allegorical commentaries on life, allusions, and a faulty attempt at subtle symbolism. One scene in particular ruins the realism of the film where Miles compares himself to a type of wine, more specifically the grape, basically reflecting how he functions as a person. I saw this as another cop-out, basically flat-out explaining to the audience the relationship between wine and life instead of leaving them to figure it out. There are many other scenes in the film that make this seem more like a novel structure with blunt symbolism and didactic dialogue than a film that relies on strong direction and acting to reveal the characters feelings. The acting is average, if anything the casting should get more credit, because each character looks their part almost to the point of an inadvertent caricaturing/stereotyping. Paul Giamatti comes to mind when you think of meek loser, as well as Thomas Hayden church when you think of has-been actor/fratboy/womanizer. So seeing how the writing is the strong point of the film, it has the obligatory (and predictable) twists towards the end to make it seem like a great plot! It will probably please a lot of people who are looking for something ""different"" but it uses just as many clichés as any other current Hollywood film aside from the fact that they are geared for a wiser audience.I'm sure a lot of struggling writers can relate to this one.",Sideways
755,dlr93039,First-Rate,10,22 January 2005,"The whole film unpacks the title, which evokes a ""going-nowhere"" stock market, where - small day-to-day fluctuations apart - values are flat in the intermediate or long term. This, of course, creates plotting problems, for there can be no beginning and no end (or only a non- or false-closural finale, such as Miles's visit to Maya before the credits). Like Gertrude Stein, the structure is all middle, and significant development is replaced by repetitions, variations on a theme. The risk of monotony is therefore immense. Sideways takes on that risk and wins, thanks not only to powerfully revealing dialogue creatively performed, but also to a whole series of exquisite epiphanies which sum up and contextualize what the viewer is witnessing. Two examples. Leaving the Old Mill drunk after failing to find Maya, Miles tacks, goes sideways, perhaps toward the road, fatally but notquite, which sums up his situation in kinetic terms.

Within this time period, there were no car chases, multi-billion dollar heists, violence or passionate exchanges, in fact, nothing really happens. Just two guys driving around without much to say. Most of the movie is like this, sprinkled with bits of humour and excitement. So what's good about that? Well, for me, this truly mirrored life. Most of us go about our days with very little 'Hollywood' excitement, trying to snatch some meaning and striving to transcend our meager existence. This is where the themes of wine and sex manifest in our main characters. Our lives aren't conducted on the linear, definite path (of right,wrong and fairness) that Hollywood normally carves out, nor do our lives end with tightly wrapped up plots that neatly map out righteous lessons for the observer. The main characters (so called) best-friend relationship and the way the movie ends really delivered this message to me. The main thing I liked was the notion that most of us settle and don't come close to achieving our dreams. For these reasons I don't believe that most younger (<30) people will like this movie. This is too idealistic of an age to appreciate. Those that aren't willing to accept that this movie mirrors how their lives are conducted will hate it as well. Me - I haven't totally given up my dreams, settled or sold-out my ideals - but this movie inspired me to reinvigorate my life and do something with it. I'd hate to end up like these guys.

Although the scenery was lovely, and I did get a hankering for a glass of wine, basically I wanted the film to end about 10 minutes into it. I kept wondering, when does it get funny? When are the best picture moments going to start? Alas, there was only one moment in the film that had me completely captivated, and if you see the film...you will know where and when it happens.

And did Hustler also demand that one of those scenes involve a porn specialty subgenre involving overweight women?I found it creepy that a character portrayed as an 8th grade English teacher would be reading this particular genre of porn, Barely Legal.

There was barely any plot, definitely no climax, and no real ending. It was like a soap opera on lithium. I went to see it after the academy awards expecting something at least. Instead I wanted to gouge out my eyes sideways during the whole thing, thus the title. I love movies and am pretty easy to please but this was so boring. I can't get attached to any character. One of the guys is a fat prick who steals $1000 from his mother (which was completely unnecessary for anything in the story and an added bonus to make it longer and suck more). The second guy cheats on his fiancée multiple times but gets his own happy ending. What the hell??? I was hoping they might both get hit by a bus. That would at least be some kind of action sequence. Instead I think the director pulled down his pants, took a large crap on the script, and somehow ended up with a ticket to the Oscars. Go figure. The academy awards have reached an all time low in even considering that movie for anything. I don't understand why people like this movie. I want my money back and I want everyone who likes it institutionalized so that no one can spread anything else like this ever again. I thought Wing Commander was the worst movie ever, but you know what...at least it had action in it. I would rather watch that back to back for a month straight than watch 5 minutes of this. I stayed through the whole movie instead of walking out and I fully regret it.

780,johnny_goat,Absolute Trash,1,28 February 2005,"I would call this movie ""American Pie for grown ups"" if that description did not necessitate a certain level of maturity in the target audience. The movie (and certainly not film) details the zany exploits of two middle aged men who intend to go on a week long sex romp through California's wine country, which is painfully less fun to watch than it would seem. Of course, the idea of a good movie shouldn't be just to have fun and, in fact, a very large chunk of the movies on IMDb's top 250 list are distinctly un-fun, but ""Sideways"" seems to have attempted nothing else; the movie has no overarching message or purgative effect, lacks any variety of engaging story, is plagued by a terrible directorial sense and fails even to inch into a third dimension for any one of its characters. And I never so much as tittered during the whole show (although I will admit that the rest of the audience carried no shortage of guffaws).So it's a trashy movie with no redeeming qualities. Under most circumstances I would just stop there or wouldn't bother to write the review at all because if that's what people want to see, I say that we should just let them see it, but there is one nagging issue that I simply cannot ignore  the critical acclaim. This movie was nominated for several Oscars, including the Best Film award (over ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind""), has a rating well over the two or three stars that it deserves here and even made it into the top 250 films list. The only explanation I can find for its success is its paltry semblance of sophistication and humanism  the semi-intelligent discussion of wine, the brief spurts of working class culture, the very un-frilly approach to sex and the fact that the movie opens by stating that it was adapted from a book (I have never read the book but, given the apparently Oscar worthy adaptation to script, I would wonder if it is even printed in hard cover). This façade very quickly breaks down as the audience is slapped unceremoniously over the head with some of the bluntest attempts at foreshadowing since Sophocles, among other equally laudable failures  meaning of course, that the Academy likes to make superficial, trendy nominations - which is all extraordinarily surprising but it all does hurt a little with every reminder.If spending seven dollars and a couple of hours on a crude, bumbling train wreck seems appetizing to you, I hope that your popcorn will be extra buttery and that the floor beneath your feet will be cleaned of all of its soda residue but please, for the sake of art accept it for being one.You might have noticed that I gave the movie a one star rating, while I wrote that it deserved two or three.

I don't mind bad behavior in a movie, but I do get annoyed when there seems to be no real consequences and/or redemption arising from it. I know reality is filled with lots of people you rather not have to deal with or even sit near you blithely go through life without any lessons learned, but movies, like ancient theater, should have a point. A few realistically depicted slices o'life does not a great movie make. Sideways has a lot of character study, nicely written smart conversations, some wine snobbery, some good funny bits and genuinely good acting, but overall it's just about a pair of grown-up buddies acting very badly and selfishly and essentially getting away with it. It's sort of like an art-house where-are-they-now follow-up of a couple ""Porky's"" characters. No real plot to speak of. Some other people also feeling that this movie is way overrated have compared it to ""Lost in Translation,"" but I think the latter has a more complex morality to it. I think Sideways compares better to ""The Grifters,"" another critic's special with loathsome main characters. At least Sideways has some funny stuff. S p o i l e rW a r n i n gSome examples of things I found very bothersome include how that little theft incident was never redressed; how Jack not only cruelly betrayed Stephanie but her daughter as well; and how Miles only got snobbishly interested in Maya when she told him she was getting a masters in horticulture -- she wasn't good enough for him before when he only knew her as a waitress. If these were real characters and you were a friend to the girls, you would have done your darndest to convince them that the guys were nothing but bad news. And if you were a guy friend, you would have punched out one or both of them. And you would have tried to make sure that phone call at the end never happened.",Sideways
784,korgand,shoddy work,3,24 May 2005,"I have only read the manuscript. This is a silly film about two man-boys in their forties. The screen play moves frivolous from bars to pastoral country settings which fill the pages of the manuscript with cheap transitions that build up to the sophomoric utterances of hormonal high school kids.I was also not impressed with the ending. At the end of Sideways (The Shooting Script) Payne's study guide questions attempts to convince the reader that his images, prose, and relationships justify a ""literary discussion"". Here is one example of one of their study guide question:In the screenplay format, Sideways is 136 pages long. Do you think it's fair that the authors were allowed to write a script this long? If not why? Is is (a typo by the editors) fair to cheat on margins? What makes you think you could do any better?What? Cheat on margins. Is this a high school boy who makes 10 pages out of 5 by double spacing? The only cheating going on in this story is Jack whose character is built on the age-old worn out notion that ""boys will be boys."" I must admit a have met men like Jack who have a clear grasp that realilty is easily divided into the black and white. The getting married is the end of one life and the beginning of a new one. Is life and time that easily divided? Jack's understanding of human nature is a polarized one that supports the ideology of clear distinctions between right and wrong, good vs evil, heaven vs hell. Is it fair to assume that once Jack finishes ""plowing fertile fields"" he will be magically tranformed into a committed intelligent man? Please, Jack, do not get married!I say that Jack should go play with motors and crash up some cars. He is not yet mature enough to think about relationships or deep and sophisticated emotions. One sentence that really bothers me in the screen play is the Payne's description of a sex screen on page 80: JACK atop Stephanie plowing her fertile fields.If the authors' intentions were to make these men look stupid then they certainly have done that and also themselves. Do the authors think they women are to be worked like the land, plowed, and only good for fertility? Well, at least the writers made her plural as the word ""fields"" suggests - as an unexplained duplicity.

For the thinking type, the film has so many different topics: wine, life, people, life, morality and mixes of all these things at once! This is, of course, the script's doing. This was one of the best scripts of 2004.The acting is excellent. Paul Giamatti plays his role without a single flaw. He is able to deliver a line that allows the viewer to somehow catch what his character really means. He gets to the guts of his character in one of the best male actor performances of the year. He was simply robbed of an Oscar! The film includes other great performances from Thomas Haden Church, Virginia Madsen, and Sandra Oh, all who have gotten a chance at last to demonstrate their real talent. And that is one of the greatest things about this movie--even actors in the smallest parts had excellent performances.See SIDEWAYS if you want to see a really well-done movie!",Sideways
787,jstine-2,Great acting and dialogue,9,27 May 2005,"Great acting and dialogue. The actors, especially Giamatti, show clear development and tone. I also enjoyed Virgina Madsen's character and thought she portrayed the character well. I enjoyed the overall idea of the picture, however, the ending was quite distracting and dissatisfying. It would be a 10/10 if the ending was more resolute or inviting to the outcome of the Giammatti character.One ending would be that the Virgina Madsen character opens the door and smiles. I think this would have made the movie a mega hit. However, I understand some directors like this ""An American Werewolf in London"" style of exiting. Its just distracting from my perspective.",Sideways
788,Illegalpat,The movie stunk,1,7 May 2005,"I was really looking forward to this movie. I heard had some great things about this film. In addition, I was aware of the awards and nominations that it had garnered.However, I found the plot to be thin and the characters to be anorexic. There was no development of the characters. As the film viewer, you knew next to nothing about the women in the story. The protagonist was whiny jerk, and his friend was insensitive.The story was bad because instead of showing you what happened, it told you what happened. For example, our hero tell Virginia Madsen that his friend is telling Sandra Oh that he loves her. When Oh founds out he is getting married, she breaks his nose. However, if we see that he is telling her this, then perhaps we could feel more of her pain when she is slugging him in the face.On the good side, I did learn a little bit about wine. Albeit, I do not drink a lot of Pinot Noir.Pat",Sideways

What kind of message does it send to our society? That anything goes, don't worry about anyone but yourself? As long as you ""feel"" good, who cares who you are hurting in the process.

I don't think you can find more comprehensive wine information anywhere else.There is no plot to the whole movie. It just wanders around without any sense, literally. Watch at your own risk.It is a such a waste of Paul Giamatti's talent. Though I have not counted, the total screen time of Virginia Madsen is not more than 15 minutes.

797,brasilbanker,Amazing,9,1 June 2005,"I am here to defend to the death, the performances of all the cast. Paul Giametti especially. This movie was excellently shot, I love the retro seventy cinematography, the music. This film really was Paul Giametti's best to date, and I wish he wasn't in the runnings this year against other powerhouse male actor leads like Jamie Foxx in Ray because if it was up to Paul vs DiCaprio, Giametti would have swept the carpet under Leo's feet. This film isn't for everyone, I watched it with my girlfriend, and could tell she wasn't into it. But it is a perfectly played out film about a washed out, wine loving, sophisticated writer. It is the week before his best friend gets married, and for his wedding gift, Miles (Paul Giametti) wants to share with his the joy of wine. Of course, you cant teach a beer lover to appreciate wine to its full extent. But in trying to teach this to his friend, he learns about living, and how to love life for what it is...It is an excellent movie and like I said Paul should have won an Oscar for his performance in this film.

While billed as a comedy, I think it may have mislead some people, because it is much more than that. I will not go into the details of the storyline because it has been done ad-nauseum here. I guess you have to be of a certain age to appreciate the characters and comedy which explains some of the negative reviews here (check out the movies they found good and you'll see what i mean.) If you are looking for mindless entertainment that you forget the second it ends, this movie isn't for you. The wine pretext was just a subtext that could be replaced by any hobby, but it seemed to fit these characters ages. The main story was about the characters themselves. Their insecurities and anxieties, just like real people dealing with everyday life.",Sideways

The actors & the actresses, I thought were the best people for the roles. The male stars put there heart & soul into the film & the leading actresses just were incredible, The funniest part of the film has to be the scene on the golf course ,were Miles & Jack are playing a few holes & Miles gets rather upset every time Jack makes a comment as he goes to strike the ball. On the tee a player strikes his ball & it lands near to Miles & Jack, Miles, very angry places a ball on the ground & strikes' it toward the players on the tee. Jack calls a great shot. With that the golfers jump into there golf buggy & drive towards Miles & Jack. Jack picks up a golf club & runs toward the on coming buggy, ranting & raving at them.

There were many little things like when he goes to his house and his mailbox is old and rusted when all the ones next to it were bran new. Symbolizing the fact that He needed to move on with his life. Instead of a coming of age movie it was a coming of middle-age movie. Because neither of the characters was getting any younger.

802,poemax777,"Stupid, one dimensional, UNFUNNY waste of time!",1,8 May 2005,"If you like ""good"" movies, those with plot, character development and maybe even... oh... a POINT, don't go see this!! Don't rent it. Don't waste your time or money.I love a good movie: Some good movies of the past that I loved? Sommersby, Titanic, Tootsie, Dances With Wolves, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Gladiator. Do I sometimes even like 'strange' movies? Sure. Even some cult classics, like Little Shop of Horrors. So, it's not like I don't have taste. The things that were ""good"" in this movie, the movie makers could not even begin to take credit for. The wine country in CA is just beautiful. But this movie against the back drop of that beautiful geography made the pointlessness and just plain stupidity of it all the more garish. There was not one funny moment, not one compelling phrase, nothing redeeming on which to focus. I have always told my children that there is no right way to do a wrong thing. Everything about this movie was just plain wrong but the place and the possible premise (two middle aged guys, one about to be married and one recently divorced, set off for a week to 'find themselves').A couple of middle agers facing identity crisis is rich material in which to mine for laughter. But they could not find a single gem. What's up with that? Wine country is a beautiful area in which to find yourself. But both characters remained lost, shallow and bathed in mediocrity. Even the full frontal nudity of an ugly, fat man chasing a car down a street in a bad neighborhood was not funny. It was grotesque. It could have been funny.... even should have been funny, if your taste runs to the risqué, but in this movie it was grotesque. In fact, it seems that was a core problem for this film.... not of the things in this movie were played for laughs. It seems like everyone checked their funny bones at the studio entrance. It was fun'damentally unfunny. No 'tounge in cheek', no tickle of the ribs, no ribald humor... nothing. Zip, nada, empty, flaccid. More flaccid than that guy with the unusually fat thighs supposedly 'chasing' our guys down the street but whose knees and thighs never had daylight between them. They appeared to be tied together or something. Right!And here is a tip for ya: When ever it takes 300 words to explain why the joke was funny, it wasn't. And when it takes critics 300 words to explain why a movie was funny or good and why YOUR negative visceral response to the movie was incorrect, the movie simply wasn't any good. They just had bad sushi (or an hallucinogen) before they sat down to write. Or maybe they were paid by the studio to say something good. Folks, if it really was funny, they wouldn't have to explain why. Laughter is spontaneous. Don't tell me why I SHOULD like it. Give me something that will hit my pleasure centers.Hype notwithstanding, don't waste your time. Really. I don't know what all the other people were smoking when they saw this film, but the best thing about it was the title. Oh.... and the fact that it did, finally, end.",Sideways

After another 10 I quit. I don't have words to describe this movie. It's the worst, and I saw a lot of movies. The bad thing is IMDb. I saw so many good movies rated bad and worst rated good.

804,martha-marina,Still surprised such a film could be made in the US,10,26 May 2014,"First a list of all the things that are excellent: the script (literate, affecting w/out over emotive nonsense, fantastic one-liner witticisms, takes place in a real world, wonderful twists, the way it is constructed), the actors (wow, what a cast, and so beautifully used), the acting (good actors can be terrible in the wrong hands), and the jibes at Merlot. It's sad, it's funny. It makes you wish you were there getting to taste all the wines. The ONLY thing that could give one pause, and it shouldn't ruin anyone's day: Virginia Madsen..has she ever been more beautiful? and her character is so elegant and eloquent of thought, so full of insight. While her character could be kind and open enough to converse with Miles, she'd be too smart and too out of his league to consider going to bed with him. Even a pity bedding. Paul Giamatti's performance is wonderful. Miles is intelligent but terminally self absorbed, a smart spoiled child who thinks he ought to have achieved more because he knows he's smarter than other people. It's precisely that feeling of being superior/clever, that makes him loser. Especially enjoyable is how character is shown by how people respond to wine. For Miles its all about how other things/wines/people are disappointing. I short all about him, his insecurity and egotism. For her it is about everything BUT her. It is how she is transported into a kind of vision-like union with the world. Transported out of herself by the sensations of the wine & the sympathy of her mind, she feels places, times past, people, their lives, and all that that entails. A sort of Proustian experience (without getting too hung up on what exactly that word means.) She has everything a writer needs, Miles is a classic case of he has one book in him: his story.",Sideways
805,justa_bunny,I Want My 127 Minutes Back!!!,3,26 May 2005,"Well, I was told that I _had_ to see this movie because it was filmed in the area. So, I watched it expecting the bittersweet comedic masterpiece that had been promised or, if not that, at least something remotely entertaining. What I found instead were the annoying shenanigans of 4 weak and wholly unlikeable characters generously peppered with gorgeous shots of the central coast in order to divert the viewer's attention from what a stink fest this movie really was.The tragic thing is that this movie could have been funny, _should_ have been funny. The film is about Jack & Miles, two friends (although, after watching the movie I believe that this term was used loosely) who embark on a road trip through the Central Coast wine region as a sort of a last hurrah for Jack before his imminent wedding. I really liked the setup and and I was rather looking forward to how the purposefully mismatched characters would play off of each other. Now, here's where the problem comes in. They didn't. Not throughout most of the movie at least. Jack's character spends the majority of this film engaging in carnal dalliances with Stephanie (whom he picks up in a tasting room) and Miles spends the majority of it moping and wishing that he were cool enough to get over his divorce and tell his crush, Maya, how he really feels about her.What little character development there is seems shallow. In the place of any real depth the character of Miles is shouldered with a heap of neurotic quirks and a water-thin back story about his ex-wife that are apparently supposed to do the job of fleshing him out. Instead, these devices appear old hat. He is the all too familiar pill-popping anxiety prone chronically depressed guy with self-esteem issues who's supposed to make you laugh because he's so pathetic. Jack, on the other hand, is the self-absorbed over confident happy-go-lucky party guy who's supposed to make you laugh because he cracks crude jokes. The female characters, Maya and Stephanie were just as superficial. Simply put, Stephanie's the ""wild"" one, Maya's the ""sweet"" one. That's it. There's nothing more to their characters than that. Again, there is an attempt at character development by turning Stephanie into a single mom and Maya into a student working on a master's in horticulture, but that attempt came across as rather contrived. I must say that the actors gave their all considering what they were given, but unfortunately their heartfelt and energetic performances just weren't enough to quell the stench.Another major annoyance that gnawed at me while enduring this film was the whole wine snobbery bit. Again, this had potential to be truly funny, but like everything else in this abomination (the dialogue, the pacing, the relationships) it comes across as forced, tedious, and dull.In summation, watching this movie proved to be an absolutely excruciating experience. I found myself fast-forwarding through many of the scenes (a thing I never do on a first time viewing) in order to save myself from the constant onslaught of drivel. ""Oh, poor me, my wife left me I'm such a loser."" ""Oh, look, it's a woman, I bet she would sleep with me."" ""Oh, this wine has a hint of clove to it, don't you think?"" In the end this purported comedy failed to elicit a single laugh from me (aside from the deplorable smooth jazz soundtrack, now _that_ was comedy). Not even during the reclaiming of Jack's wallet while Miles is being chased down the street by a doughy naked man did I crack a smile. By that point I was over the whole thing.",Sideways

The fact that it was a smash hit frightens me dearly and speaks volumes about the state of American cinema. It's ridiculously slow moving and filled with dreadful characters. Neither of the lead men's characters is likable at all, particularly the lead character - get over your self pity already. The Asian character is totally unnecessary, they really didn't need to flesh her character out at all, any one or series of wham bam thank you mam women would have sufficed. And the blonde's character starts out as slightly appealing, but then for the life of you, you can't figure out why she goes for Mr. Pity Me and so you end up disliking her. And the 5th character - wine itself - which probably gets a full 20 minutes of the film - is worshipped to such ridiculous proportions that only a true yuppy could appreciate its ""depth"". Horrible movie. I felt like I wasted 2 hours of my life. And trust me, I love wine, and I love women - but I sure didn't need this film in my life.

After talking to a few people about this film, it seems to be divisive, due to the fact that people either love it, or they find it boring, but usually, that's how comedies are. If people don't find the jokes funny, than they will not laugh, which is the point of a comedy. A comedy without the laughs makes for a very boring film. I could see why many found this boring, because the conversations between characters can be difficult to understand, and the two main characters spend much of their time on screen drinking wine, but some of the jokes are complete gold. Also, instead of thinking of the film as having a slow pace, which it has, I find it kind of relaxing. What a film!",Sideways
809,kimwoojong,Why does Jack Cry about his Lost Rings,8,6 June 2005,"This comment is made to Cpartak who could not understand why Jack cries when loses his rings and the possibility of losing his fiancé.This movie is about the journey (not the physically journey thru wine country) the two men make in discovering the truth about themselves. As the movie begins, Miles is depicted as a 100-pound weakling kind of guy who is the furthest from a masculine image. He's the cry-baby who can't let go of his ex-wife, is so low on self-esteem that he can't even see that a very beautiful women is actually attracted to him. Jack on the other hand is introduced as a strong, masculine, macho guy. Even if he is a has been actor.Anyway, the scene where Jack breaks down like a little girl and starts to cry is, I admit, a bit difficult to understand at first. But when you think about it, that's the turning point of the movie. Miles goes on to accept that his ex-wife is now gone, he has found the confidence to go back on knock on the door of the women he has begun to love. Jack is really nothing but a coward behind his macho image. It is Miles who boldly enters the house to get Jack's rings and wallet back, and risks probably getting shot at by the husband of the women who Jack was screwing around with. This moment truly defines the true characters of the two friends.If you weren't able to see that, you should take a deeper look at life before criticizing movies you were not mature enough to understand.",Sideways

An especially awful bit of acting was Church's unbelievable bawling after leaving his wedding rings in his one night stand's house. I kept waiting for a punchline but was disappointed that it was apparently real. I couldn't get in to the whole wine appreciation thing. Half of the movie could have been easily eliminated by removing the excessive wine babble scenes. Any opportunity for dialog was filled with yuppie references to wine no one drinks. I feel an obvious play to wine snobs in this movie which will attempt to fit in with other wine snobs who say this was the best movie ever so they don't feel left out while secretly wondering why they watched this movie.

I enjoy offbeat movies with unlikeable characters... I adored ""Happiness"". This movie seems adolescent and pointless. I too felt sorry for Christine who will dote on her ""car-accident-injured"" Jack and marry him. I cannot understand how Jack could be an actor... he seems as capable of emotion and understanding as a five year old. He wants to get his kicks before getting married, including going so far as to think he has fallen in love with ""a hot chick"" he's known for less than 24 hours, leading her and her child on... but only when he loses the wedding rings does he suddenly say ""he's nothing without his fiancé"". This is completely out of character. The $ theft by Miles was crass too, and unexplained. The whole movie seemed shallow and juvenile.

816,XPelargos,Wine is a metaphor for love/life,9,6 September 2005,"SLIGHT SPOILERSAfter reading a few posts, it seems that many people were put off by the screen time devoted to talking about or drinking wine. However, as the movie goes on, it becomes clear that the cultivation of grapes and the process of making wine is a metaphor for a relationship. Pinot noir grapes require great care and must be constantly tended to and only grow in a few niches, just like a relationship, which only works with a few (or in the case of marriage, one.) I know there's a reason Miles hates Merlotbut I forget. However, I think the pinot noir represents Mile's ideal of a relationship, and Merlot represents his friends form of relationships.That's my 2 cents.",Sideways
817,bigsteve1037,Don't Get It - Movie Sucks!,2,25 March 2006,"Is this one of the ""artsy"" flicks everyone pretends to like? I don't get it. Lacks depth and we kept waiting for the comedy to begin. If everyone else is afraid to say it I'm not - this movie sucks. So boring, bland, and uneventful. While the character of Miles was portrayed well - the character was so boring the movie would have been better off if he had acted like someone else. And could there have been more boring wine talk? Trying to equate wine to life was lame, lame, lame. At least try to make the connection less obvious. I can't say it enough - this movie sucks. Save your time and watch a mound of dirt - it would be more interesting.",Sideways

His was the most stilted, obnoxious performance of the year. The only thing good about this movie was Giamatti's performance. that is the only thing that deserved credit in this movie and yet the only that the Academy seemed to snub. This once again goes to show how self- absorbed the Academy has become. This movie only appeals to the upper-crust elitists who enjoy pretending to poke fun at their own superiority while at the same time mocking the less refined, laughing not because the jokes are funny but because they feel giddy that they are sophisticated enough to get them.

821,mem-17,A Failed Endeavour,3,9 September 2005,"This movie had some vague potential to be a good film. There was the basis of an art-mimics-life storyline which could well have been parlayed into an insightful assessment of parts of the human condition.There were elements of humour and elements of allegory (some rather nice touches included using the language, classically pompous, of wine appraisal as a metaphor to describe aspects of real-life personalities).Regrettably, the storyline never really emerged above pavement level. Whilst there may have been some potential for the four lead actors to really strut their professional stuff, they were essentially hog-tied by poor writing.Paradoxically the characterisations that could be vaguely discerned beneath the surface were not only real, but potentially valuable insights into some of the less palatable behaviours that we have all either experienced all taken part in. These portrayals however were never allowed full expression, and were clouded by tried scenarios and impoverished language.There were some elements of humour. There were some elements of slapstick. There were some elements of pathos and there were some elements of circus sideshow. However, none of these were ever fully integrated and the movie itself lurched from scene to scene without any real efforts to explore or even tease out the more significant underlying theme.This was, in my view, more properly a European movie. The storyline needed to be developed slowly and steadily and the characterisation allowed to unfold without distractions of slapstick antics.There were some good lines, intermittently, but far too infrequent for the volume of dialogue that they were expected to sustain. At a subterranean level it was possible to perceive a story that well deserved to be told.Ultimately however the crudeness of the plot allowed neither the potential of the storyline or whatever the real skills of the four main actors may be to come to the surface. Basically, a failed endeavour.",Sideways
822,jameshudson-06132,Sideways. To be appreciated by those that will admire a true and honest film.,10,16 February 2017,"Amongst the endless and certainly varied spectrum of dramatic comedies Hollywood has to offer, there has yet to be a tale that resonates so deeply with oneself... That is, until i saw Sideways... What surprised me most about Sideways, was not only its unpredictability in the form of Giamatti's marvelous acting, but the way in which it steadily stayed afloat from start to finish. Through its directing, acting and cinematography, this film brilliantly showcases the endeavours that we all can (in one way or another) appreciate, and whether you liked it or not, acknowledgement of this is without doubt, past due. Exploring Miles' character can be - at times - somewhat complex, however, it's gradually eased thanks to Thomas Haden Church's wonderful support. I heed this to not disregard Giamatti's acting skills, but to in-fact marvel them.Beyond the sleazy nature of Jack and Miles' antics do we develop an intriguing and thought-provoking observance of their growth, from minute one to one-hundred. Watch this film with your eyes, feel it with your mind; for it's a masterclass that's devilishly underrated. Where there's an ovation deserved, there's an ovation awarded. Bravo.",Sideways
823,gumbroski1974,This is Fantastic,10,30 September 2005,The best since the Coen brothers went south .. this has everything that a cinema lover asks for. Paul Giamatti is an unrealised genius in todays cess-pool of acting talent. This is a real human story expertly told and perfectly acted with the whole gamut of emotions ...great photography.. great locations ... the kids wont like it but for fans of pure cinema this is a real story with no ambitions or pretensions - the way I like them. I wish they were all made by the same team almost because it is so rare that a piece of work has any intention other than those financial ones dictated by production. Instead we the viewer are treated to a bounty of talent which in the current marketplace is rare. Check it out - you know the plot - watch the independent talent at work and restore your faith in cinema,Sideways

I asked to be borrowed, because I hadn't seen it when it was released : PULP FICTION, and it gets an 8 out of 10 for the violence/criminality/sensationalism.It had been played so many times that it was wearing-out (skipping & stopping).I'm 61 years old, and ashamed that SIDEWAYS was unappreciated, because the ""PULP FICTIONS"" are considered...uh.... campy/lowly/parody/comic book spectacles.But I am a person whom actually enjoyed THEY SHOOT HORSES, DON'T THEY?, a damne fine under-rated DEPRESSION tragedy, a 10 for me.I feel guilty for not at least watching the entire thing.",Sideways

The movie was incredibly slow paced with the two main characters being completely unlikeable. I didn't root for anyone and never understood why the waitress would ever like someone like Miles. They showed him to be a complete loser who stole from his mother and drank way too much. It didn't make sense how she would connect with him, the whole wine connection is just not enough reason, he had no qualities of his personality that were attractive. I also kept waiting for something to happen and wanted to give the film a fair chance, I wanted to like it but it was just awful.",Sideways
826,stevencerna1,Sideways- Reminds us how complex and frail we can be,9,18 October 2005,"""Sideways"" reminds us how truly effective and moving a movie with a great script, wonderful characters and impeccable acting can be even without the aid of smoke and mirrors. The movie revolves around its two main characters Miles and Jack. Jack (Christian Hayden Church) is a struggling actor, and Miles (Paul Giamatti) is a failed author with a voracious and knowledge of fine wine. The two are former college buddies out to spend some time together before one of them (Jack) gets married. Both go on a wine tasting tour through northern California although their aims are different. Jack would like to sow his oats before he gets married, while Miles aims to wallow in a depression caused by a divorce two years previous and a writing career headed nowhere. While on their trip, Jack and Miles meet Maya (Virginia Madsen) and Stephanie (Sandra Oh). Maya is also recently divorced and shares Miles' love of wine while Stephanie is a single mom who piques Jack's interest. Things get a little complicated as Jack thinks he is falling for Stephanie, but omits to her the fact that he is about to get married. Miles, on the other hand, continues to drown on his own depression despite being showered with attention by Maya. Stephanie shows Jack his grave error of omitting the fact the he was soon to be married by furiously confronting him and leaving him with broken nose. However, Jack manages to move on to the next available woman. Meanwhile, Miles slowly realizes that Maya is around and begins to open up to her. Their road trip ends when both have to come back for Jacks' wedding. While ""Sideways"" show us the worst in people as shown in Jack's insensitivity and Miles' total self-absorption, it also gives us a peek of how frail and endearing people can be. The movie does not even try to give resolution to complex and emotional situations and by acknowledging this; the viewer is able to better appreciate the complexities and frailties of being human. ""Sideways"" with its relatively no-name actors effectively manages to tell a great story without the typical Hollywood ending, but still leaves the viewer satisfied.",Sideways
827,massmediathursdays,Sideways is okay if you have 127 minutes to kill,6,20 October 2005,"What happens when you combine a week of wine, womanizing and weirdo's on a road trip? Things go sideways! Itis the story about the ups, downs and sideways journeys of life.I had heard so many times how great a movie Sideways was. It was nominated for five Academy Awards and was the winner of two Golden Globes including Best Picture for a Musical or Comedy. I looked forward to finally seeing it.The story was unique. Two male friends on a week long wine tasting, golfing vacation at the Central California Coast wineries to celebrate the last few days before one of the guy's wedding. At times it was slow moving, but clever and entertaining. The four main characters were very interesting and played extremely well by the actors.The male lead ""Miles"" (Paul Giamatti) was a very bizarre individual. He was obsessed with fine wine, especially Pinot Noir. He was an Eighth grade English teacher trying to get his novel published to no avail. His best buddy ""Jack"" (Thomas Haden Church) was on a mission to sleep around with any woman willing as his wedding rapidly approached.The local woman they befriended were friends. The mild, calm and smart waitress ""Maya"" (Virginia Madsen) and the wild motorcycle riding, sex loving single mom winery server ""Stephanie"" (Sandra Oh).Miles is attracted to Maya and Jack and Stephanie get physical! The woman find out that Jack is getting married and felt betrayed. Some of the funnier moments of the movie follow that discovery. One was when Stephanie breaks Jack's nose with her motorcycle helmet when she found out she was just a play toy. Another was Jack crashing Miles car into a tree to use the car ""accident"" as a cover story for his broken nose.Sideways was an okay movie. Not great, but not horrible. The scenery was good. The actors made the movie worth watching. I was a bit disappointed after all the hype. If you have 127 minutes to kill, give it a try.",Sideways
828,robertshex,"Boring, Annoying & Predictable",2,20 October 2005,"You've seen this movie many times before: two mismatched companions go on a road trip. Usually, there is at least one likable character, but Sideways features two of the most annoying characters ever to appear together in a film. One is a whiny, neurotic, depressed loser and the other an immoral, live-in-the moment, upbeat cad. Surprise, surprise, they are exact opposites. The fact that they are friends is completely unbelievable. In real life, these two people wouldn't get within 100 yards of each other.In every generation, the media seem to feel the need to elevate some second tier actor to a cult status. Once, for example, it was Warren Oates. Now it is Paul Giamatti, who has long specialized in whiny loser and sidekick roles. He is about as tiresome as an actor can be. I've never before had the urge to punch a character in the movie in the face and tell him to shut up, but this time I could barely resist. His constant raining on his friend's parade was painful to watch.Of course, I probably miss the point. According to critics, if it is depressing, it is high art. This movie's appeal probably lies in the fact that everyone feels like a loser to some degree, so the audience achieves some catharsis by seeing someone more pathetic than they. It is original sin played out on the screen. Life is misery and we are all sinners who deserve to suffer.This is about the most Catholioc movie I've ever seen. And one of the worst.",Sideways

Now as a result of this movie, we can experience in real life a whole new set of morally corrupt people thinking wine tasting is a good way to escape moral accountability. I'm trying to come up with 10 lines that sum up how bad this movie was. What's interesting is - no one that I've spoken to has liked this movie either. It's like the same 30 people have pumped this movie up. When the reality is it's just a bad flick that needs to be forgotten.Like I said I can't come up with 10 lines that fully express how pathetic this movie was. It was like watching a train wreck.

Actually I thought it was tedious and poor. The trailer showed what little to this film there really is. That 'hilarious' scene on the golf course.... Well worth a nomination. A slow and pointless journey though some unidentifiable saddo's pointless life. ""But Rob, he likes wine"" Do I hear you all cry? So what? is this somehow supposed to make the film watchable? I spent the whole time in the cinema waiting for it to end. Call me a masochist but i waited for the credits and with no avail. It didn't get any better. Without the hype this film would have taken its rightful place as a straight to video and ended up in every high street charity shop or bargain bucket. In conclusion.....

As far as rating goes this movie for its ability to rile you up may be the sole reason its spectacular in production but nothing else.Miles is the ideal loser that can't seem to put himself in the right shoes. The guy has everything going for him, but he somehow manages to bitch and moan about it and screw things up. People who are unwilling to attempt to make themselves and the world around them better, deserve life in a hole. I mean seriously, if you want to continually digest in you own self pity and go sporadic like a drunken douche bag when things get rough, then you really don't deserve happiness. Anything you touch goes down the drain, dragging other people along makes Miles worse off than just being a self pity loner.",Sideways

I've been told that only wine drinkers enjoy it, but that is wrong. Only depressed alcoholics who steal from their mothers can find this amusing. Then they laugh at the pretty girl's ass. I despise a movie where you despise the main character. In this movie, he was greedy, conniving, and phony. He was the stereotypical alcoholic, and had no depth as a human being except for his faults. The only tolerable parts were of the female actresses of the movie, and they had a small part of the movie.

What a sickie! My heart went out to Miles. Very humorous in general with sadness in the wings! The wine-tasting part of the movie seemed so real. I wonder if the info was actual!

835,notprasanth,Comedy.,10,1 February 2006,"Sideways.. a Hilarious comedy.. with a modest cast of actors and a script well structured to fit the budget. It's a story of two friends, Jack (Thomas Hayden church) and Miles ( Paul Giamatti ) who go out on a road trip which is kind of a part of Jack's bachelor party, with all the right intentions of getting laid on the freeway before he is subjected to the eternal bondage. The whole movie is about how this trip changes the lives of these two friends, how they help out each other to realize what they actually want. Not much of an eye opener, but more effectively a good-break from the regular stream of life that can change their perspectives for ever. Characters... The main character of the story, Miles is a Highschool teacher, who aspires to be a writer, and gets as close as a struggling writer, who's been rejected his entire life is someone who is usually mistaken to be a loser. He had a bad break-up with his wife two years ago and since then landed up in a depression and these rejections just add up to his negativity. As, the movie progresses the script starts unveiling the shades of his character and the his addiction to ""wine"" and his latent traits of depression.Jack's..character on the other hand is quite opposite to Miles, it's a regular formula for comic flicks, when you put two characters that are so unlike each other, every contrasting opinion or situation they encounter can have a lot of humor. For instance In ""Mid Night Cowboy"", the straight forward country kid ""john void"" and the complicated thief ""Dustin Hoffman"". In ""Butch cassiddy and sundance Kid"", ""Robert Redford"" as the calm, quick handed ""sundance"", ""Paul Newman"" being the talkative, ebullient and smart ""butch"" This formula when put in to use effectively is a great tool to generate on screen humor and after a point when audience are aware of these contrast even a normal scene which doesn't have any contrasting opinions will look funny. So, Jack's character is one of those soap-opera regulars who now is doing add films and fishing for new contracts, an easy going, adventurous and slightly dumb actor.The writer, uses his knowledge of Wine's to create so many scenes and portraying Jack as a person who just wants to drink the whole bottle rather than being a connoisseur like Miles which just exposes the contrast again.""Maya's""(Virginia Madsen) character.. She is a middle single women, who works as a waitress in a bar and also takes college to graduate in 'Horti culture"". She becomes the love interest of Miles, and the author shows how difficult it is for miles, who's portrayed as a born looser, to consider ""Moving-On"" In life as an option. His inhibitions, add to so much humor and Paul has done a great job in portraying this character.All in all, a good movie, with so much to learn from the script. It just shows how a good concept can nullify the need for big time stars and High Budget Sets...",Sideways

Miles(played by Giamatti)that's who. Paul Giamatti may be the most overrated actor ever. Maybe I am the only one that thinks this because people are raving about his performance in Cinderalla Man (perhaps his worst performance ever IMHO).The only reason movie critics liked Sideways was the fact that most of identified with the rotten looser Miles. I don't think I laughed once when I saw this offal. I felt more of a sorrow and disappointment that people actually laughed and related with these characters. If you think stealing money from elderly women suffering from dementia is admirable of funny or is even acceptable than you might enjoy this movie. I for one was repulsed.,Sideways

838,specialsilk2002,Minor correction of Sideways review,10,23 February 2006,"The movie was, indeed excellent. Minor correction: This was not in or about Northern California Wine Country. Solvang is by Santa Barbara, which is about 1.5 hours north of Los Angeles, but still in Southern California. Northern California wine country is Napa and Sonoma, roughly 6 hours north of Los Angeles. But one of the great things about this movie is that they reference and introduce people to the Santa Barbara wine country and its differences and complexities. Wouldn't want them heading for Napa, looking for Solvang! Also, I might suggest that the quotes section is too long, containing some lines one might consider spoilers when they do see the movie. They contain pretty much the highlights of the movie. Sampling some fine or classic conversations is perfect, like Jack's and Maya's thoughts about why they are into wine, which at the time, I felt were priceless and quite deep about the individual characters' motivations. Some of the quotes are not priceless or unique unless you've actually seen the movie.",Sideways
839,dave-2382,Excellent acting and observed directing,8,7 March 2006,"This film stands head and shoulders above most that attempt to examine both the complexity and needs of everyday relationships. The characters are detailed and hold the viewer's attention throughout. Miles and Jack are flawed and often confused, sometimes deceitful men, while Maya and Stephanie are dealing with life with an honest and sincere approach. The humour and pathos comes from the interaction between the two men and their 'forty something' search for their uncertain future balanced against the buddy-bonding from a college past.Paul Giamatti is superb as the nervously grinning Miles and Haden Church excellent as the 'woman obsessed' Jack. The added bonus is an introduction into the wonderful world of wine!",Sideways
