0,TheLittleSongbird,"The weakest of the series, but Myers still has his mojo",7,4 May 2010,"After thoroughly enjoying the first two Austin Powers movies, they were daft but enormous fun, I watched this third instalment. I was disappointed admittedly, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. The plot takes the whole meaning of daftness to a whole level, so some of it verges on ridiculous, and while Mike Myers is brilliant as Austin and Dr Evil, he overdoes it as the Dutch villain Goldmember and the cameos are very hit and miss. That said, the sets and costumes are still wonderful, the soundtrack is groovy and the script is comedy gold with the cool catchphrases, bad-taste buffoonery and surreal slapstick. In terms of supporting performances Beyonce Knowles is a knockout as sexy and sassy Foxxy Cleopatra and Michael Caine is a dentally-challenged delight as Austin's dad. Seth Green is also fun as Scott Evil. Overall, an inferior sequel, but it was still a lot of fun, with Myers still having his mojo. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Austin Powers in Goldmember
1,bkoganbing,He Loves Only Gold,6,3 January 2010,"Most of the cast of the first two Austin Powers films return for this third and latest Powers creation, Goldmember. I say latest and not last because I think with sufficient interest and the possibility of a good box office, Mike Myers could possibly be induced to revive Austin Powers and all the characters he created in the three films.Powers is back with his opposite number Dr. Evil and his henchman from the Spy Who Shagged Me, Fat Bastard and in this film he creates a new and even more sinister international villain in Dutch master criminal Goldmember. So named because he leaves the male members of his male prisoners painted gold, dead or alive. The members and the prisoners that is.Well if stealing Austin's mojo in The Spy Who Shagged Me didn't stop Powers, maybe kidnapping his father will. So Michael Caine enters the general mood of hilarity in Goldmember as Mike Myers father Nigel Powers who is kidnapped and taken back to the disco era of 1975.If you remember Powers was cryogenically frozen as Dr. Evil was in the first film and then sent back to the sixties. Now he gets a chance to experience the Seventies and things are wilder and crazier in the disco era than they were in swinging London of the Sixties. Myers gets some help from American agent Beyonce Knowles as Foxy Cleopatra, but with his mojo going full blast and the fact that Dr. Evil doesn't want a rival in the evil business, Powers gets the job done.Seth Green gets to shine a bit more in this film as son Scott Evil who finally looks like he's coming into his own as a worthy successor to head the Evil Empire.Altogether Goldmember is a nice Shagadelic experience, really groovy baby.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
2,SnoopyStyle,Michael Caine great but Goldmember not funny,6,29 December 2013,"Dr. Evil and MiniMe escape from prison and team up with Goldmember to flood the world by using a tractor beam to pull a meteor down to melt the polar ice cap. Goldmember has kidnapped Austin's father Nigel Powers (Michael Caine). Meanwhile Austin also travels back in time to 1975 to stop Dr. Evil and Goldmember.Michael Caine is a great addition. Beyoncé Knowles is not as good. The problem I have is Goldmember. He's very creepy, very weird, and not very funny. Fat Bastard does return and he's the good kind of weirdly funny as oppose to Goldmember. Mike Myers continues to add new interesting originality to this franchise. I just wish he could rewrite Goldmember or maybe just skip him altogether. And it's great to see MiniMe get a good important side story.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
3,kosmasp,Hard Knock Gold Life,5,21 July 2009,"The Austin Powers movie series obviously runs out of steam, with it's third (and up to this point) final installment of the series. While many were glad to see him and although many would likely be watching a fourth part and therefor making it successful commercially, fortunately it was decided to stop here.While this movie isn't bad (especially comparing it to the recent flood of ""spoof"" movies) it still is obvious that it lacks the originality and power that it originally had. Mike Myers still goes all out (you could compare his passion and dedication to one Jim Carey, but the latter has shown, that he can change pace and character), you still won't get a great movie experience out of it. Watch it once and it's OK, but this definitely can't hold a repeat viewing",Austin Powers in Goldmember
4,lee_eisenberg,How far can they go?,7,28 May 2006,"This time, Mike Myers plays Austin Powers, Dr. Evil and Fat Bastard, plus one new character: a Dutch guy named Goldmember who wants to help Dr. Evil take over the world. That's the main plot, but the movie is really an excuse for a bunch of silly gags (namely the subtitles). The female interest this time is Foxxy Cleopatra (Beyonce Knowles), whose cool never ebbs. The other addition is Austin's father Nigel (Michael Caine).Anyway, ""Austin Powers in Goldmember"" is raucous fun from beginning to end. You just have to remember not to take anything seriously - and believe me, you can't. Reprising their roles from the earlier movies are Seth Green, Michael York, Robert Wagner, Mindy Sterling and Verne Troyer, while the guest appearances this time are Fred Savage, Steven Spielberg, Tom Cruise, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kevin Spacey, Danny DeVito and Britney Spears.And that's life, baby!",Austin Powers in Goldmember
5,jboothmillard,Austin Powers in Goldmember,6,9 March 2005,"This is the third of the Austin Powers spy spoofs. Mike Myers returns Austin Powers, Dr. Evil, Fat Bastard (from The Spy Who Shagged Me) and a new character called Goldmember (hence the title). Dr. Evil plans to take over the world with the help of Goldmember's plan. With the help of Foxxy Cleopatra (introducing ex-Destiny's Child singer Beyoncé Knowles) from 1975 he attempts to foil his plan. As the film goes on he is accompanied by his father (like most trilogy's in the third film). His Dad is played by the well suited Michael Caine. As the film goes on Dr. Evil's son Scott (Seth Green) starts to turn evil too, and Dr. Evil starts to ignore his clone Mini Me (Verne Troyer). So Mini Me decides to help Austin and Foxxy. A very good comedy with many famous faces, including Michael York as Basil Exposition, Tom Cruise, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kevin Spacey, Danny DeVito, Steven Spielberg, Quincy Jones, Britney Spears, Nathan Lane, The Osbournes and John Travolta. Mike Myers was number 46 on The Comedians' Comedian. Good!",Austin Powers in Goldmember
6,ccthemovieman-1,Austin's Anatomy,8,21 January 2007,"While the first two Austin Powers films in this comedic series concentrated on spoofing the late '60s/early '70s, James Bond movies and concentrated on female anatomy in the process, this one was centered on penises. I kid you not. (Hence, the title, a play-on-words from ""Goldfinger."") I watched this film twice, within two weeks of each as I showed a friend the second time. The first time I thought it wasn't as funny overall as the other two Powers films and was a bit too raunchy, especially for the PG-13 rating which is ridiculous. After the second viewing, I changed my mind about the comedy (not the rating): it is just as funny if not more than the other two.A couple of the scenes were hilarious, although very crude in spots but some of the crudeness is what makes it funny. However, most of time I laughed more at the many subtle double entendres and all the double takes by Mike Myers, who plays at least four characters in here...all of them very well.It's goofy, stupid and nothing spectacular but definitely fast-moving and entertaining. If you've seen the other Austin Powers films, you know what this basically is going to be, humor-wise.Beyonce Knowles, who played the female lead, didn't have the beauty or body of Heather Graham or Elizabeth Hurley, stars of the other two films, but she isn't bad. There are numerous cameo appearances in here, starting right off the bat with Tom Cruise.Overall: sick (again) but funny (again.)",Austin Powers in Goldmember
7,BA_Harrison,"Solid gold, baby! Yeah!",8,26 February 2018,"Goldmember, the third film in the Austin Powers trilogy, is another hugely satisfying helping of abject silliness guaranteed to please fans of the previous two movies. The film opens in grand style with a star-studded, action-packed sequence in which Tom Cruise plays Austin Powers in AustinPussy, a Spielberg movie based on the exploits of England's most swingingest spy. Gwyneth Paltrow is Cruise's sexy sidekick, Dixie Normous, Kevin Spacey is Dr. Evil (no comment) and Danny De Vito plays Mini Me. This is all followed by a groovy musical routine that sees the real Austin Powers (Mike Myers) in a dance off with Britney Spears.After this superb introduction, we follow Austin as he travels back to 1975 to search for his father Nigel (Michael Caine), who has been kidnapped by Dutch criminal Goldmember (Myers again), who is working with Dr. Evil (Myers again again) on a plan to hold the world to ransom. While in the '70s, Austin teams up with the aptly named Foxxy Cleopatra (Beyoncé, who looks amazing, all cleavage and curves), who accompanies Austin to the year 2002, where they encounter Fat Bastard (Myers again again again), and team up with Mini Me (who has defected to the good side) to foil the villains' dastardly scheme.The film is packed to the brim with gags (there's no 'downtime'), most of which are extremely puerile but also hilarious, making the Austin Powers series as a whole one of the most consistently funny cinematic comedy franchises I can think of. I challenge anyone to keep a straight face as Powers hides behind a statue of a peeing cherub, gets distracted by Number Three's huge mole, is covered in sumo wrestlers' 'mawashis' (the belt that goes up their ass-crack), or takes a medical whilst balanced on Mini Me's shoulders. I'm giggling to myself just thinking about it!",Austin Powers in Goldmember
8,moonspinner55,"Star cameos and outrageous toilet humor, some of which is very funny...",5,22 August 2006,"Third retro-spoof for Mike Myers' Austin Powers, '60s super-spy transplanted to the present day, is an improvement over the previous installment, 1999's ""Austin Powers The Spy Who Shagged Me"", although that isn't saying much. The suave International Man of Mystery is once again pitted against Dr. Evil, who has hatched a plot to flood the world. Evil is now in-cahoots with Goldmember, a power-mad genius from 1975 who sports a golden phallus. Mostly a succession of raunchy gags--and yet, all the effort still can't top the naughty-yet-innocent original from 1997, which seems positively sedated next to the manic ""Goldmember"". Imaginative set-pieces, great music, inane jokes, plus pop star Beyoncé Knowles, who is very assured on-screen (something which can't be said for Michael Caine, looking pained as Austin's father). ** from ****",Austin Powers in Goldmember
9,Quinoa1984,one of the funniest film of the year so far; though not for everyone,7,26 July 2002,"I'm sure there's an audience out there not for the comedic taste of Mike Meyers- there are more flatulence/penile/bowel movement/general excrement jokes to fill three other movies, and it's all crammed into a 96 minute piece. With that said, I loved it; I've been a big fan of Meyers through his career and with this third installment I can faithfully say I laughed more during this than Spy Who Shagged Me (the laughs grow less and less since I first saw that three years ago), although it doesn't top the first if only because it still stands strong as a solid comedy with originality as its strong suit, not gross out, albeit hilarious, gags. This time, Meyers adds the eccentric Goldmember (said title), from Holland, he has his private area submerged in gold and can lift both legs up at will; he plots to destroy the world with Dr. Evil and Powers teams up with Beyonce Knowles (Foxy Cleopatra) and his father (Michael Caine in the slyest role of the movie).With cameos from the likes of Tom Cruise, Britney Spears, Kevin Spacey and Ozzy Osbourne, and a moments where laugh a minute is more than literal, this is a highly recommended flick on the front of strange and funny.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
10,michaelRokeefe,The shagadelic man is on the move again.,4,7 June 2003,"This is the third of the Austin Powers installments. The shagadelic superspy must do some time traveling to rescue his father(Michael Caine)who has been kidnapped by minions of Dr. Evil. Powers enlists the help of Foxy Cleopatra(Beyonce)to back up to the swingin' seventies to find his father. I don't think I laughed out loud, but admit there was an overload of ""potty mouth"" humor and sexual innuendos. The talented Mike Myers of course gives life to three other characters than Powers: Dr.Evil, Fat Bastard and Goldmember. Also in the cast are Robert Wagner, Seth Green and Michael York. Not recommended for the small fry of the family. Try and count the number of genital gags/ jokes. Behave yourself, Baby!",Austin Powers in Goldmember
11,studioAT,Austin Powers in Goldmember,2,29 July 2021,After an excellent pre-credit sequence (which in itself deserves 10 stars) this goes downhill fast.A shame.,Austin Powers in Goldmember
12,bevo-13678,Funny,10,2 November 2020,I like all the funny jokes that were also in all the other Austin powers movies,Austin Powers in Goldmember
13,Theo Robertson,Time To Say Goodbye Baby,5,2 November 2005,"Despite enjoying the sequel more than the original I thought GOLDMEMBER was the weakest in the Austin Powers trilogy possibly due to the air of entire self indulgence that runs throughout the movie . This is personified by the appearance of Michael Caine as Nigel Powers . You can just imagine Caine picking up the script and reading : "" Nigel is surrounded by four sexy skimpliy dressed bimbos in knee length boots "" and Caine thinking "" Well I grew up in absolute poverty and fought in The Korean war so what have I to feel guilty about "" In other words the cast are in serious danger of enjoying themselves far more than the audience and you do get the feeling the film is more for the people who worked on it rather than the worldwide audience Take the highly intrusive self referential pre title sequence cameo appearances . How does the film benefit from this ? It doesn't . Likewise there's some clumsy continuity from Jay Roach . For example Austin is in the villains base and chase's after the villain , the only thing is the base is crawling with the villain's henchmen and at no point do they interact with what's going on . I should also confess that having seen this movie several days ago only one funny sequence sticks in my mind . One where Austin grabs the wrong end of the stick involving Mini Me while there's several scenes that stick in my mind because they're painfully unfunny like the subtitles and the joke that was recycled from the previous movie . Watching GOLDMEMBER isn't quite a painful cinematic experience but certainly the producers could have come up with something far better . Hopefully this will be the last ( And it's certainly the least ) in the Austin Powers franchise",Austin Powers in Goldmember
14,preppy-3,Huh????!!!!????,1,22 August 2002,"Who the hell thought this was funny?  I'm not a Mike Myers fan (I hated ""Wayne's World"" and ""So I Married an Axe Murderer""), but a friend of mine dragged me (kicking and screaming) to see it.  Obviously, I'm not the best choice to see this film but I tried to view it objectively.  Well...I hated it.The film looks fantastic and (with the exception of Myers) has a great cast, but the plot is all over the place, the ""jokes"" are pretty stupid and Myers has a very unhealthy fondness for fart jokes--there are TONS of them. They're not even remotely funny--they're crude and stupid. 
I dozed off halfway through the film...I also noticed people walking out of the cinema--that's never a good sign.There are a few cameos at the beginning that are slightly amusing but that's it.  For Mike Myers fans only.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
15,Calicodreamin,Tight like a tiger,7,13 July 2021,"A great end to the trilogy, goldmember has the laughs and has some great moments. The storyline is bogus, but it doesn't matter, there are so many iconic scenes that it makes up for everything else.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
16,Boba_Fett1138,The best of the so far 3 movies.,8,14 July 2003,"What the Spy Who Shagged me did wrong, Goldmember did right. Instead of using old jokes and situations, Goldmember knows how to be original.All the characters are even crazier then ever in this one. And then there are the new characters...Goldmember is even sillier and crazier than Dr. Evil and sometimes even funnier with his silly accent, Nigel Powers ( Michael Caine) is a great addition to the cast and Beyoncé Knowles can actually act!Like in the 2 previous movies, the story is not important. It are the jokes that make the movie. The best thing about silly movie's is their silliness and Goldmember has plenty of that! There are lots of scene's that make you laugh out loud, something that the other 2 Austin Power's movies at times lacked.If you didn't liked the previous 2 Austin Power's movies then simply don't watch this one. If you liked the previous 2 then this one is a must see!Best comedy since years. Eagerly awaiting part 4.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Austin Powers in Goldmember
17,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,About as good as the second,7,10 March 2004,"While this is still not as funny as the first one, it's still worth watching. It has a load of recycled jokes from both of the earlier films, and a little too many references to the first, in my opinion. It's not entirely bad though, after a slow start it kicks off and gets very funny, very quickly. Most of the old characters return, with a few new ones too. The plot is pretty much the same old deal from the first two, still spoofing old Bond movies. The acting is still pretty good. The characters are more colorful in this one, I think. More developed, perhaps. The sexual crude humor is still there, and is better here than in the second movie, I think. The first is still the best, but if you only see one of the sequels, I recommend you see this one. I thought the twist-in-the-end was pretty lame, but it didn't entirely ruin the movie, as it didn't seem totally out of character or totally unbelievable. I'd recommend this to anyone who liked either or both of the first two movies. The humor is mostly the same, and people who enjoyed the first two will most likely also enjoy this one. 7/10",Austin Powers in Goldmember
18,view_and_review,Myers does an excellent job as different characters,8,16 April 2007,"I was a late comer to the whole Austin Powers craze. I passed on seeing the first two after seeing the trailers for them, I automatically figured they'd be dumber than dumb. I only saw this movie because 12 hour work shifts get really long and we have a t.v. here at work... so what are you gonna do?? This movie was hilarious. I was never really impressed with Mike Myers from his Wayne's World lore, but he certainly impressed me in Goldmember. The irony of it all is that the funniest things about this movie were the characters Mike Myers played besides Austin Powers. Austin Powers was humorous and had his place, but Fat Bastard, Dr. Evil, and Goldmember were a riot. This movie was a great mix of subtle humor and in your face comedy. This movie propelled me to see the prior two, but I don't think they were as funny.Goldmember was excellent, and definitely a top comedy in my book.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
19,evanston_dad,I'm Dixie. Dixie Normous.,7,30 June 2010,"Mike Myers plays both Austin Powers, as groovy as secret agents get, and Dr. Evil, Powers' arch enemy, in this comedy franchise that spoofs everyone's favorite secret agent, James Bond.Though all three entries in the series are hit and miss funny, the hits mostly outnumber the misses, and if you think Mike Myers is funny, you'll probably think the films are funny, because they're basically just venues for Myers' trademarked brand of schtick. Though the plots differ nominally, the three separate parts of the trilogy are essentially the same movie with the same jokes just put in different order. But they're good jokes, and it's just as funny watching Myers and company deliver the same punch line for the third time as it was the first.Grade: B for the whole series",Austin Powers in Goldmember
20,anaconda-40658,Not Golden.,5,11 August 2015,"Austin Powers in Goldmember (2002): Dir: Jay Roach / Cast: Mike Myers, Verne Troyer, Beyonce Knowles, Michael Caine, Seth Green: The series may be running out of mojo for Goldmember lacks the freshness of the first film and duplicates jokes that were already repeated in the second film. Goldmember is a slang term and the name of the villain who kidnaps Austin's father Nigel and brings him back to 1975. Standard fare but director Jay Roach reveals the origins of Powers and Evil. Mike Myers brings energy as the sex-craving secret agent and the absented-minded Dr. Evil. Austin feels disappointed at the absence of his father. Dr. Evil goes to prison, and we learn more family secrets. Myers also portrays the new villain Goldmember. Verne Troyer goes through growth as Mini-Mi who joins Evil in prison but will question his worth when Evil's son Scott takes a step up. Beyonce Knowles is underwritten as Foxy Cleopatra who appears as an agent in 1975. She serves little purpose other than to parody classic Pam Grier roles. Michael Caine as Nigel is a pleasure and inspired casting despite the predicted resolution. He is kidnapped by Goldmember but feels hardly fazed. Seth Green also returns as Scott Evil with an interesting transformation of his own. Despite its recycled vulgarity the production is colourful and pointlessly amusing. In its 70's galore. Score: 5 ½ / 10",Austin Powers in Goldmember
21,HotToastyRag,Absolutely hilarious,9,23 November 2017,"Mike Myers is back for a third installment of his hilarious spy spoof franchise in Austin Powers in Goldmember. He continues to wow and amuse audiences with his multiple roles, playing Austin Powers, Dr. Evil, Fat Bastard, and Goldmember, the new villain in the film. You'll see some familiar faces, Michael York, Seth Green, Robert Wagner, Mindy Serling, and Verne Troyer, but in this third movie—which doesn't necessarily have to be watched in order, but it does help—you'll most likely roar with laughter because of the new faces added to the cast.Firstly, and let's face it, most importantly, Michael Caine is in the movie. Since Mike Myers had previously revealed part of the inspiration behind his Austin Powers movies was Michael Caine's Harry Palmer character, it's pretty adorable and fitting that Michael Caine was recruited to play Austin Powers's father! And, as a very sweet touch, since Myers's glasses were made to be a replica of Caine's, Caine found his original frames from the 1960s and wore them for the film! Michael Caine is everything you'd expect Austin Powers's dad to be, and pretty much everything out of his mouth is completely hilarious. I'm sure you'll gain some household phrases from this movie, whether it's ""If you have an issue, here's a tissue"" or ""There are two things in this world I hate: people who are intolerant of other people's cultures, and the Dutch"" or his joke about Viagra.Next up is the hysterical opening to the film: At first you think you're just watching Austin Powers in a car chase sequence, but he gets out of the car and it's actually Tom Cruise! Turns out, Steven Spielberg is making a movie about Austin Powers, starring Tom Cruise, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kevin Spacey, Danny DeVito, and John Travolta. Add in cameos by Britney Spears, Quincy Jones, Katie Couric, the Osbourne family, Burt Bacharach, Rob Lowe, Clint Howard, and Nathan Lane—in one of the funniest gags of the movie—and you'll be on your toes for the entire film, wondering who's going to pop up next.Beyoncé makes her film debut in the movie, and while it's painfully clear she has zero acting ability, if you'd like you can cut her a little slack since she was only twenty years old. Still, her lack of confidence and talent in front of the camera doesn't really detract from the rest of the film. It's extremely funny, and full of phrases you'll find yourself repeating for decades to come.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
22,Aaron1375,The weakest entry to the Austin Power's series to me by far.,6,17 July 2007,"I liked the first two Austin Powers' movies quite a bit. Not so much with this one, this one was okay as most of it we have seen before. Granted, there was a humorous opening I did not expect and the closing was the same, but the stuff in the middle was just same ol same ol. The only two new facets in this entry are Michael Caine as Austin's dad which is somewhat funny and Goldmember a new villain who is not funny at all. Also, Austin has a new girl and Beyonce is the weakest of the Austin girls by far. So the story, of course Dr. Evil has a plan involving Goldmember, kidnapping Austin's dad and a new doomsday device all doing most of the same jokes from part one and two. Sure some of it is still a bit funny, but it is also old too. The story is not as fluent either as it goes here and there making jokes at everything and not seeming to be as well put together as the first two were. Then there is the revelation at the end that makes little sense especially considering the previous two movies. So just about everything in this one is weaker than the previous two movies. Nothing really is better here and for the most parts you are just revisiting jokes from the previous installments as well. So in the end if this is the last one of the series it goes off on a rather weak note, and I have not heard anything about a sequel anytime in the future and how this one ended I would not think it possible anyway so expect a good chuckle here and there, but nothing new really worth seeing.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
23,Wuchakk,Entertaining end to the zany trilogy,6,30 April 2015,"Mike Meyer's three Austin Powers flicks parody James Bond and the swinging 60s-70s. They are as follows: ""Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery"" (1997), ""Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me"" (1999) and ""Austin Powers in Goldmember"" (2002). What's interesting about these films is that Austin Powers (the character) is not a full spoof of 007 as he's his own character, just with Bond-like qualities.Anyway, I wasn't sure I wanted to review any these flicks because, by doing so, I'm admitting that I actually watched them (lol)! I say this because they're so goofy, juvenile, silly, sometimes raunchy (more verbally than pictorially) and filled with toilet humor. So I was never a fan and didn't even watch any of them until 2009. What turned me off? Besides the toilet humor and raunch, Powers (the character) seemed to have a gayish quality despite being a renowned ladies man in the stories. A good example is when he says, ""Oh, beHAAAve,"" which never struck me as funny, just gay.I've since seen all three twice and, despite my reservations about Powers and distaste for toilet humor, I do enjoy the zaniness and stoo-pid humor. If you can catch a grip with these films they're laugh-out-loud funny about a third of the time, sometimes more depending on the movie.""Goldmember"" is my second favorite of the trilogy behind ""The Spy Who Shagged Me."" It has the best opening, by far, with unexpected cameos and the first half is often laugh-out-loud funny. If it kept up the laughs it would've taken first prize, but the second half loses its mojo, while still being likable and amusing. Beyoncé takes the place of Heather Graham as Austin's babe while Fred Savage plays Number Three and Michael Caine appears in a pretty significant role.Best quote: ""Riiiiiiigggghhhttt."" The film runs 94 minutes and was shot in Southern California; Reno, Nevada; Moab, Utah; and England.GRADE: B",Austin Powers in Goldmember
24,namashi_1,Hilarious!,10,20 November 2011,"'Austin Powers in Goldmember', the third installment of the Austin Powers series, is, without a doubt, the funniest installment among all. Also, Mike Myers, reprises his previous characters, along-with Goldmember, most entertainingly. 'Austin Powers in Goldmember' Synopsis: Upon learning that his father has been kidnapped, Austin Powers must travel to 1975 and defeat the aptly-named villain Goldmember - who is working with Dr. Evil.Like it's prequel, 'Austin Powers in Goldmember' too is over-the-top and silly. But, like the prequels, it's entertaining nonetheless. I truly found this film as hilarious. I had a complete blast. And what I admired, was the fact, that, I had seen this film years back and even after 9-long years, it still continues to make me laugh hysterically. I am not saying that is Great Cinema, but definitely, memorable & light-hearted cinema, that genuinely entertains. Mike Myers & Michael McCullers Screenplay is over-the-top, zany & nuts. But, throughly entertaining & funny. Also, the character of Sir Michael Caine, who plays Austin Powers' Dad, is extremely likable. Jay Roach's Direction, relies completely on the gags & the performances. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are good. Performance-Wise: Mike Myers entertains in all the characters he portrays. As Austin Powers, he gets it right, as Goldmember, he is amusing, as Fat-Bastard, he is expectedly creepy, but is simply incredible as Dr. Evil. Sir Michael Caine is outstanding as Austin Powers' Dad. Beyoncé Knowles does a fair job. Seth Green is superb, as usual. Verne Troyer as Mini-Me, is funny. Michael York, Robert Wagner & Fred Savage support well. On the whole, 'Austin Powers in Goldmember' is over-the-top, comedic cinema, at it's best.

25,Smells_Like_Cheese,It's more of a blast from the past.,6,29 July 2002,"Here we are into the third installment of ""Austin Powers"" and sadly it is wearing thin. We don't have the same originality that the first one brought or the usually funny jokes. Now while the ideas were good and it seemed strong, it just didn't give.The beginning is classic and it seemed like this was going to be great. I mean, we have Tom Cruise playing Austin Powers, Kevin Spacey as Dr. Evil, John Travolta as Goldmember, and Danny Devito as Mini Me in the Austin Powers movie! Just great and brilliant. But then the actual movie starts, Felicity is not here for no explained reason and Austin is single. Leading him to Foxxy Cleopatra, played by Beyonce and is way too stereotypical. Fat Bastard is also back and tries too hard with his disgusting jokes that fall flat.Dr. Evil is still pretty funny, but again just loosing his touch. We have a brilliant idea of Michael Caine as Austin's dad, but it's a hit and miss with Caine's dull performance. Goldmember, also played by Myers, is just too disgusting and tries too hard to impress the audience as another funny villain. Scott has now decided to take over the family business, which takes his cool and unique style away. :( Mini Me is push aside then from Dr. Evil and he joins up with Austin to try again for that ""shocking and ironic"" laugh of him now being a Mini Austin. The ending is just ridicules.I'm sorry, this just didn't amuse me that much. The jokes were overused and not funny any more. There are too many stereotypical performances in here and the only thing worth watching is the beginning with the amazing cameo's. That was unforgettable, but the rest is just a skip.

Troyer as Mini-meAustin Powers is back, in Austin Powers in Goldmember. This time, Mike Myers is playing 4 characters, Austin, Dr. Evil, Fat B*s&t^a%d, and the aptly namedGoldmember. Seth Green returns as Evil's son, Robert Wagner as Number 2, Mindy Sterling as Frau Farbissana, and Verne J. Troyer as Mini-Me, a clone 1/8 the size of Dr. Evil.  In this supposed last entry into the Austin Powers franchise, Austin (Myers) must use the help of Dr. Evil (Myers) to find an infamous villain from the seventies, named Goldmember (Myers) , an eccentric Dutchman who loves gold, and also has a disgusting habit of eating his own peeling skin, to rescue his father (Michael Caine). After traveling back in time to the seventies, and going to Goldmember's club, Austin accidentally meets up with an old flare, Foxxy Cleopatra (Beyonce Knowles of Destinys Child), who is undercover. The two team up, and rescue Austin's father from Goldmember, only to learn Doctor Evil's new plan. After traveling back to 2002 with Foxxy and his father, Austin attempts to foil Goldmember and Dr. Evil's new plan before it's too late, and they'll also find out the truth between Dr. Evil and Austin!  With more cameos in the first 5 minutes than any movie I've ever seen before, and hilarious jokes, Austin Powers in Goldmember lives up to the other two films. With excellent interaction and chemistry between characters, and a great ending to the trilogy, this is not a let down to the fans. There were only a few things about this film that turned disgusting. One is with Fat ^&^$%^ and a sumo `diaper' as he calls them, and another especially with Mini-Me and Austin behind a curtain. Other than this, Austin Powers in Goldmember is great, and is filled with non-stop laughs from beginning to end. One of many absolute hilarious scenes occurs with a remake of the song `It's a Hard Knock Life' from the broad way play, Annie, but in this remake Dr. Evil and Mini-me rap it, and it's hilarious!
   See this movie for laughs, plain and simple. Powers fans, won't be let down. An ending to end all endings occurs, and pleased me very much. Cameos. Humor. Good movie. What more could you ask for, baby? 4/5 starsJOHN ULMER",Austin Powers in Goldmember
28,sddavis63,The Weakest Austin Powers Movie Is Still Fun,7,31 July 2003,"As the title suggests, I think that the first two Austin Powers movies were better than this one. Having said that, what's really not to like about a movie that continues to have me laughing on a fairly regular basis every time I see it?Mike Myers has this part - or should I say these parts - down to a perfect ""T."" His portrayals of Austin and Dr. Evil are hilarious. In this movie he adds the character of Goldmember to the repertoire, and also reprises the role of Fat Bastard. It was only this latter part that I found him disappointing in. Fat Bastard wasn't nearly as funny as he was in the second of the series. I liked Michael Caine's portrayal of Austin's father Nigel, and the exploration of the relationship between the two, with a resolution that wasn't entirely a surprise. I did wonder why in the world it was felt necessary to open and close the movie with the portrayal of a fictional movie (within the movie) that Steven Spielberg was supposedly directing about Austin Powers' life. It gave the opportunity to allow for some cameo appearances by some big name actors (John Travolta, Kevin Spacey, Danny DeVito, Tom Cruise and Gwyneth Paltrow are all supposedly acting in this fictional movie) but it tended to confuse the issue a bit, and the cameos weren't really necessary; neither was the fictional movie integral at all to the actual movie.Having said that, there are some hilarious moments here. The fight between Austin and Mini-Me; the ""shmoke and a pancake"" scene which for some reason had me hooting; and the priceless physical that Austin undergoes on Dr. Evil's submarine. As per usual for Austin Powers, the humour is sometimes crude and sexual innuendo abounds, but this is nevertheless a very funny movie.7/10",Austin Powers in Goldmember
29,thesar-2,"Third time's not Golden, baby",3,26 November 2009,"I've said this before, and I'll type it again: only see this Austin Powers sequel once.While Austin Powers in Goldmember has its moments, such as the terrific opening credit scene (the best so far,) they are so few and far between making some of this movie's unbearable.I didn't heed to my own warning, and this is the second time I've seen it. But, then, I don't like to write reviews on movies I haven't seen in awhile. This one being almost 7½ years.This time out, I got tricked. After being somewhat disappointed in Austin Powers: The Spy That Shagged Me – comparatively speaking to the brilliant Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery, I was pumped up after the now-established opening dance scene. And I thought this would bring the series back on track. Unfortunately, it only goes straight downhill after that.Austin captures Dr. Evil immediately in this chapter, but learns through a Hannibal Lecter/Magneto meeting that another Mike Myers's creation, Goldmember, is on the loose to cause havoc. Austin must race, literally, back in time, this time in the 1970's, to thwart Goldmember's plans. Back to the year 2002 he goes and everyone's where they're supposed to be situated to make an Austin Powers movie.A few things have changed: Austin's dad (Caine) plays an important role, Scott becomes more evil while the always-scene-stealer Mini-Me loses some and more history of Austin and Dr. Evil's past is revealed.Sure, the movie has its moments. Some parts I did laugh out loud. But for the most part, it was definitely getting stale, the jokes recycled and the newest, uh, member, Goldmember ,was unbearable to watch. Yeah, I know a lot of humor is gross-out jokes, but when he eats his skin (sorry, I never caught that spoof/reference) it's beyond nasty.Again, it's worth maybe one viewing, but I have to almost say skip this one and pray, if they make a part IV, they'll attempt to reboot the series back to its hilarious roots. At least come up with some new jokes.",Austin Powers in Goldmember

31,Lejink,For members only,4,7 February 2011,"The attempted jokes come thick and fast and thin in this third and to date last outing for Mike Myers' parody of swinging 60's spy-romps, but by now familiarity was starting to breed contempt and as is usual the third time around, some situations are just pushed too far, going well beyond, for me anyway, acceptable boundaries of taste. And yes, I am thinking of what I'll politely call the bodily functions jokes which are played out for too long, outstaying their welcome every time. Add to this the mile-high overblown prologue where big-name Hollywooders demean themselves in knowing cameos, a plot that just won't start and some obvious in it either for the money casting (the Robert Wagner and Michael Caine pension schemes) or for the exposure (Beyonce Knowles in a part completely unsuited to her) so that you're grateful when the odd genuinely amusing moment does come along. Me, although I saw the punchline coming minutes before it arrived, smiled most at the Styx-ian pun on Mr Roboto, although I doubt many others outside North America would get the gag and there were a few other funny lines scattered throughout, but the law of diminishing returns was well in evidence to the extent that I think we can all be glad that Powers didn't return in ""Austin-pussy"" or ""Thunder-balls"".",Austin Powers in Goldmember
32,paul2001sw-1,Rejuvenated Powers,7,10 May 2003,"James Bond is so over the top anyway that any spoof needs to be completely ridiculous.  To be fair, Mike Myers has never aimed for anything else, but the first Austen Powers film ran out of steam about halfway through.  This, the third installment, is actually much better, relentlessly piling on inventive but terrible gags and aided by some hilarious celebrity cameos, with Michael Caine's self-parody the best.  The humour is never less than crude (sample joke - first Japanese girl: ""I am Fook Mi""; second Japanese girl: ""And I am Fook Yu"").  Yes, it's that awful, but somehow you still have to laugh.  Better than it should be.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
33,bowmanblue,Bronze effort for the Gold one,7,30 August 2014,"The second Austin Powers film was that rarest of sequels which was actually better (or at least on a par!) with the first. Therefore, the third instalment, aka 'Goldmember' had a lot to live up to. Does it? Just.Despite all its efforts, it isn't quite as good as its predecessor. It does come close, but the jokes have a 'recycled' feel to them and the new baddie (Goldmember himself) isn't a patch on Dr Evil. And now the two of them have to share screen time, therefore you still get the major laughs from Dr Evil and Mini Me, whereas you only get a couple of amusing catchphrases from the Gold Dutchman.But, this is just light-hearted entertainment at its best. It doesn't try to be anything too deep and meaningful and, if you liked the first two, you should enjoy this, too. If you've never seen an Austin Powers movie before, this is probably the wrong place to start. You're probably best to start at the beginning and if you like that one, try the next two.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",Austin Powers in Goldmember

One more thing - this film has the most amazing opening and titles part that I have seen in ages. If there was an Oscar for titles this film would sure get the 2003 edition. Go and watch, but be prepared - what follows is not at the level of expectations that the beginning of the film may create.I have not much more to add.

I was supposed to be watching some other dumb movie, but this film grabbed my attention. I was laughing just as bad as the first two films. Once again, Mike Myers reached my expectations as his many characters. Beyonce was a surprising hit as Foxy Brown. Seth Green and Vernbe Troyer are just a few notable actors that performed well. In my opinion, the jokes got funnier. The shadow jokes were the best jokes of the movie. There is also a bit of a surprise when Mini-Me went from evil to good. The music was good as well. I liked the song at the beginning when ""A Hard Knock Life"" was performed. The script worked well. There should be another sequel. I give the number three and final movie of the series 9/10.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
36,lesleyharris30,"While Losing a Bit of Charm, it's Still Laugh Out Loud Funny,",8,13 March 2014,"Austin Powers in Goldmember is a great movie with a with a well developed plot line, a top notch cast and, of course, fantastic characters. There is absolutely no denying that it is ridiculous fun from start to finish, jam packed with hilarious sequences, terrific cameos and stellar one liners throughout. This is a franchise that I think is difficult to get wrong as long as the cast are having fun with it. I will admit, however, that it is weaker than the previous two as a result of a little too much repetition. It plays up a lot of what worked in the other movies, to the degree of repeating entire jokes that we have already seen before. I just felt that it should have let itself be its own movie a little bit more. The cast is as good as ever, Mike Myers shines in the four roles he now plays in this movie, and his versatility as a comedic actor is no question. As well as several returning members, we have delightful new additions, such as Beyoncé Knowles as Austin's love interest Foxxy Cleopatra, and the great Michael Caine as his father Nigel Powers. They both manage to fit themselves in to this bizarre universe effortlessly. It is side splitting hilarity from start to finish. Great fun with a top notch comedic cast, I would recommend Austin Powers in Goldmember to anyone looking for a good comedy. In order to save his father, Austin must travel back to the 70's and defeat the evil Goldmember, who has teamed up with his arch nemesis Dr Evil.

37,CuriosityKilledShawn,"My God, it's just...AWFUL!!!",1,4 February 2007,"I've never liked the Austin Powers movies (or Mike Myers for that matter) as they have always come across as being the product of an over-indulgent, but not very bright, imagination. They'll all so flimsy and crudely stapled together that it baffles me why people adore them and spend $200 million+ at the box office. Are we so braindead and slovenly that utter, utter garbage like this is what passes for our collective sense of humor? As previously, the film is just random scenes of nonsense connected in the most superficial of ways with a moronic 'plot'. And don't give me 'but that's the point', because I don't think that excuses it for having absolutely no class or sophistication whatsoever. Everything, from the camp static sets to the pathetic widescreen photography reeks of Wal-Mart movie making. It's all so amateur.I actually walked out of the 2nd Austin Powers film (and I really should have just switched this one off but Michael Caine kept me watching) as the character of Fat Bastard seriously offended me. I don't think it's fair to make Scotland the butt of such a vile, xenophobic joke. But, I guess that's as far as Myer's imagination goes when creating characters as everyone here in this film is nothing more than a cultural stereotype. Quite irresponsible for a wannabe-blockbuster.I wish I could say that if I ignore a monster such as this, it would go away. But that just won't happen.

39,The-Sarkologist,"Everything you loved, and more",7,29 September 2021,"I would say that this film is rather strange, but then again it is Austin Powers so that sort of goes without saying. Well, I have now rewatched all three Austin Powers films, and I have to say they are actually pretty good. A part of me didn't like them back in the day, namely because of the heavy sexual innuendo that was present in the films, but these days I have lightened up a lot and I have come to really appreciate just how good these films are.Sure, they are a parody of James Bond, but the thing is that they are a really, really good parody of these classic films. In fact, while there have been a number of attempts to parody the most successful film franchise in history, no-one come anywhere close to the skill that Mike Myers has managed to put into his trilogy. Mind you, the fact that he plays multiple characters in the film goes to show just how great he is. Actually, I suspect half the reason he does this is because he probably couldn't get actors to pull off the characters the way that he wants to.The interesting thing he does with this film that he bookends it with a parody of the parody. It is a film called Austinpussy, and he has famous actors playing all of the characters that he plays in the franchise, and some more. Like Tom Cruise plays Austin Powers, and Gweneth Paltrow plays Dixie Normas. Yeah, I just love the names of the characters in the films, even if they aren't innuendos, such as Basil Exposition - the name relates to the fact that the M character in the films simply exists to provide exposition.While this film is rather old, and pretty everybody has probably seen this film, there are some lovely twists in this film anyway. Micheal Caine appears as Austin's father, and we have the main antogonist, who doesn't happen to be Dr Evil, Goldmember, whose name came about because his member was turned to gold in an industrial accident. The other cool thing about these films is how Dr Evil's submarine actually looks like Dr Evil. Oh, and also the fact that Dr Evil's plans are just so ridiculous, despite the fact that Number One tends to have much better ways of taking over the world, simply adds to how ludicrous the film is.Yeah, this franchise is actually pretty awesome, and this film is no exception, especially the scene at the end. Mind you, while there are suggestions about Scott Evil becoming more evil, it has more to do with him becoming ludicrous like his father, as opposed to being evil, but also rather rational. Like, the sharks with lasers on their heads. Yeah, I have to admit that I love this film, and thinking about it certainly does bring a smile to my face.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
40,briancham1994,Silly as usual,6,3 June 2020,"The Austin Powers films have a very silly style of humour which did not appeal to me. I didn't find the protagonist very endearing and got tired of him after a while. Still, I felt like I should watch the whole series and I think this one wasn't so bad. Some of the gags were alright, the story was zany and there were some additions I liked - Scott Evil and Tom Cruise in particular.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
41,tomgillespie2002,Myers picked the right time to call it a day,5,20 April 2016,"It's easy to forget that the first time the world was introduced to Mike Myers' wonky-toothed and bespectacled British superspy back in 1997 with Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery, precious few people went to see it. The film eventually gathered a huge following when it was released on VHS, and the formula was recycled again for the smash-hit sequel, The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999). The character and his arch-nemesis Dr. Evil are now so ingrained in popular culture that it's quite bizarre to think that you could once shout ""oh, behave!"" or ""yeah, baby!"" at a friend to receive a look of utter bewilderment in return.The franchise proved so popular that its two sequels repeated the same gags and failed to really move the story on. Despite this obvious flaw, The Spy Who Shagged Me and the (as of 2016) final instalment Goldmember still managed to generate enough belly laughs to give them a pass, often relying on the irresistible comedic charm of its star Mike Myers. However, it was clear that the series was running out of steam by the time number 3 came around, as Goldmember remains the least funny of the trilogy, introducing a forgettable baddie in the form of the titular gold-obsessed, skin-munching Dutch supervillain, also played by Myers.Yet the film kicks off with the greatest gag of all the movies. Just as we think we're watching an over-the-top set-piece from one of Austin's missions, its soon revealed to be a movie within a movie, with Tom Cruise wearing the spectacles and Kevin Spacey as Dr. Evil. We are then treated to the expectedly ridiculous, but entirely endearing, opening dance sequence, this time involving Britney Spears. Its a level of hilarity that the remainder of the movie sadly fails to maintain. For the first time we get to meet Austin's father in the form of Michael Caine, and Beyonce Knowles donning an impressive afro and plenty of sass as Foxxy Cleopatra, in a loving tribute to blaxploitation.The bulk of the movie consists of the characters being restrained by their own eccentricities, which after two previous movies starts to stretch the humour a bit thin. Like Fat Bastard from the second entry, Goldmember is a one-joke character when the joke isn't that funny to begin with. His innuendos and disgusting habit repulse to the point of being simply unpleasant. Its at its best when it sticks to what made the franchise so lovable to begin with - the Bond pastiches. There's a ludicrous masterplan in there somewhere and the scenes in which Austin and Evil go face-to-face are as priceless as ever, but when Myers tries to insert some dramatic weight to the mix involving Austin's daddy issues the movie starts to drag. By the end, its clear that he picked the right time to wave goodbye to his most successful character (although he hasn't had much luck since).",Austin Powers in Goldmember
42,zkonedog,Just Too Darn Funny To Get Old,8,10 March 2017,"After watching this third installment of the Austin Powers film series, one can't help but wonder how director Jay Roach can get by with using the same type of humor for three go-'rounds. Well, the answer is simple: The characters are just too darn funny to get old!For a basic plot summary, ""Goldmember"" sees Austin Powers (Mike Myers) once again battling Dr. Evil (Myers), this time with 1970s ""supervillain"" Goldmember (Myers), a spoof of the classic James Bond villain Goldfinger, thrown in for good measure.Once again, the same basic jokes and tone of humor is used in this effort, but it just never seems to get old in the least. Plus, more of an actual storyline (dealing with ""daddy issues"") is present in this one than in its two predecessors. New characters Nigel Powers (Michael Caine) & Foxy Cleopatra (Beyonce) also add a bit of spice to the cast.Overall, this film simply keeps the Austin Powers comedy ball rolling. It may have slipped a tiny bit from ""The Spy Who Shagged Me"", but nowhere near enough to drop it a star ranking.",Austin Powers in Goldmember

Expectations weren't as high and somewhat expected a drop in quality.Goldmember as a film is the worst of the franchise. Although wasn't too impressed with the original, that film had a decent concept and wasn't too forced with its comedy and the plot was fresh and occasionally intriguing. The sequel was more silly but added new characters in Mini-Me and Fat bastard and they added something well. Although that was a step down as.Now this film and this franchise sunk to a new low. Goldmember is just forced in its comedy, rehashes jokes from the previous film and the tone isn't as mysterious or compelling.

44,johnnyboyz,"Hardly sparkling, nor indeed worth its weight, Goldmember has its amusing moments but limps in the long-run",5,5 October 2013,"""Austin Powers in Goldmember"" brings the curtain down on a mostly unremarkable series, something which exploded into life with an often funny spoof of spy films whose most interesting parts were when it juxtaposed life in the 60's with life in the 90's via subtle montages. It gave way to a sequel which ought not ever even existed such was its often intolerably lax nature, but Goldmember is a film which, to an extent, brings the franchise back. This is very much the sequel ""The Spy Who Shagged Me"" should have been, with Elizabeth Hurley's character from the first one perhaps returning to fill the role of the female accomplice; the time travel element removed and everything else remaining the same. Distancing itself from its roots was a brave thing for Goldmember to do, but distancing itself from the likes of the 1999 sequel was almost mandatory – thus, Jay Roach's 2002 second sequel is here stuck in a precarious position although just about manages to find a way out of it.The film will begin loudly and bombastically, in a manner that suits most fatuous Hollywood action movies, via its aesthetic and general content. For a franchise to be synonymous with the Bond films, I view this as a slight on more contemporary entries and how devoid of character and charm they are in the opinion of the makers: spoofing Oddjob and the idea of a hunched, cat stroking villain in a swivel chair is good fun out of the fact these people and their characteristics are so distinct and charming – fast-forward to what we're expected to spoof through the likes of ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" or ""The World is Not Enough"" and much is lost. How are you meant to riff on something which is so action orientated and without the sort of soul evident in the films of the 60s? But the film is not even a ""The Player"" take on what goes on behind the backlots of Los Angeles, filthy money grabbing cameos-and-all. Nay, for what we get is yet another entry which appears to be bored of Dr. Evil as the villain (before changing its mind); appears to be bored of the 60's and thus sees the 70's as an ideal setting (before changing its minds for the 2000's) and wants to throw in this quasi-deep father/son relationship subplot which, around all the action and in true ""Last Crusade"" style, is meant to see us all sigh in recognition that two men of the same name finally come together and accept each another.The chief difference in this third film compared to the others lies with its villain, Mike Myers' own Goldmember, a send up of 1964 smash Bond hit ""Goldfinger"". But where's the sense in sending up one of the most loved; most cherished Bond villains, about whom mostly nobody has anything nasty things to say? Spoofs are supposed to send up the relatively unloved; the often derided, the derivative and the easily mocked. Here, Goldmember is a world-hating; skin flake consuming abomination of a much admired former villain who speaks mock-Dutch and has suffered genital pratfalls. For a while, and with Myrers' other creation Dr. Evil behind bars, it looks like things are heading in the sorts of fresh directions with this fresh villain and the time setting of the 70's which was sorely required three years earlier. Alas, the film welches and it isn't long until we're back into a familiar groove whereby an African American character called Foxy Cleopatra (Knowles) is filling the female void whilst paying homage to a movement of films the target audience won't even have heard of. At one point, Knowles' character (herself an agent) is brought forward to the then present of 2002 – how does she react to this revelation? Why, by laughing at an Internet video of a monkey falling off a tree.I read somewhere that Myers based his performance of Powers on that of Michael Caine's in his 1966 breakthrough role ""Alfie"" – look closely at Powers in that first one and you will see scraps of Caine's Harry Palmer character as espionage and British spy films of the 60's are parodied. I mention this out of the fact Caine appears in this entry as Nigel, Austin's father. In a franchise that needed to expand, Caine's suave take on a former top agent and the material they give him is, admittedly, somewhat amusing. The way in which he points out how useless anonymous henchmen often are when the time comes for them to take on the hero in these sorts of films not only cracks a good observational joke but tees up further changes another character will undertake when Nigel's capabilities in psychological warfare are applied.Social critique was never the reason anyone tuned in to an Austin Powers film, but that doesn't mean there weren't instances of it in previous entries. Here, an amusing 'dance off' between Powers (with his group of 60s go-go dancers) and Britney Spears highlights an inherent clash in attitudes towards music of the then-and-now. Through Spears, we observe the highly provocative and heavily sexualised route contemporary popular music has undergone over the decades. Her backup singers are topless, everybody's clothing is black and leather invoked – things are much more aggressive. On the other side of the stage, Myers initiates a mock-fisticuffs session with Spears wherein his clothed, bubble-gum and seemingly normal troupe of flower-power girls and boys do battle to a thumping musical soundtrack as these two very distinct eras of music and attitudes towards dancing and music play out. The sequence isn't anything important plot-wise, but it's one of the best of the trilogy and proof that there is something at the centre of the whole Austin Powers idea which was always there, but just never quite tapped into. The film, like the series as a whole, is colourful and energetic but ultimately a bit drab and often inconsequential.",Austin Powers in Goldmember

46,Anonymous_Maxine,AAAAHHHH no frickin' way!!!,3,14 February 2003,"Just in case you missed it in the last movie, the Austin Powers series has completely fallen off a cliff. The third installment in the Austin Powers series accomplishes little more than proving that the first sequel was not the full depth to which the series planned on sinking. The second movie fed completely off of the success and original comedy of the first movie, recycling the same jokes and trying vainly to get people to laugh at the same things, with a few new tasteless and downright bad jokes thrown in between. MiniMe and Fat Bastard (who, combined, provided about 20 seconds of amusement in the first sequel) are both back here and neither provides anything new or even anything amusing.There are sporadic moments in the film that are funny (even two scenes that made me laugh out loud), but they are so hidden in a slog of garbage that they are not worth the rest of the movie, and they're both only briefly funny anyway. There is a scene where Dr. Evil gets hit in the groin by a swinging object and screams out what you can find in the summary line of this review and, even better, Austin has a touching and lengthy flashback remembering his flaky father and how he was never there for him to see his accomplishments, and when he comes out of the memory and we see his emotion-stricken face, Dr. Evil (locked up in a glass cage like Dr. Lecter) says, 'Oh, boo-frickety-hoo!'That's funny, isn't it? Well, I laughed at it. But then you have to deal with the rest of the movie. The old scene with Dr. Evil and his son Scott arguing at the table is brought back from the dead, this time so overdone and so tired that it literally dissolves to the point where Dr. Evil is simply grunting and groaning and making strange noises, which I assume are meant to be funny. They're not. If you haven't, in fact, gotten to the point where you're raising your eyebrows and looking around at the people next to you to see if they're as mystified as you are about how this has gotten so bad, you definitely will here.Beyoncé Knowles plays the part of Foxxy Cleopatra, coming off as one of the most nerve-gratingly aggravating characters ever to set foot in this doomed series, and vainly trying to fill the tiny shoes of Heather Graham from the first sequel, who provided probably the first thoroughly boring character in the Austin Powers movies. Her wooden acting and total incongruity to the character she was playing made me think that they would have simply taken out the heroine completely for any third movie that they might be greedy enough to make, but instead they throw in the exact same thing. Both are characters put into the movies for no other reason than to have a popular face playing a tasteless character in an Austin Powers film.I think that the trilogy is such a common occurrence in movies that it's safe to say that this will be the last installment made in the Austin Powers series, but I think it's also worth mentioning that this is the first time I have ever made a specific effort to hypothesize about whether or not they will ever bombard us with another crapfest from a series of movies that is so obviously dead and gone (and I'm still terrified that someone is going to come up with the fool idea that they should make a third Scary Movie - I could stand about 25 more Austin Powers' movies before another one of those). The second movie should never have been made in the first place, and the third one is more than overkill.And by the way, I saw this movie at Leicester Square in London when I was in England doing a study abroad program through the University of California, Davis, studying Shakespeare in the summer of 2002. PLEASE believe that you have not the slightest idea of what I missed out on when I went to see this movie.",Austin Powers in Goldmember

They travel back in time to 1975 where they join forces with goofy Dutch businessman, Goldmember (Myers) who is obsessed with gold. Austin (Myers) is sent to 1975 teaming up with agent, Foxxy Cleopatra (Knowles) to stop them. Soon, Mini-Me decides to turn on Dr. Evil after he and Scott (Green) get close. Savage plays Number 3 who is a new member of Austin's organization, York returns as Basil, Wagner returns as Number 2 and Sterling returns as Frau. Myers also plays Dr. Evil's henchman, Fat Bastard who appeared in the last film. This is a good comedy sequel, Myers, Caine & Knowles are great and I recommend this.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
48,FiendishDramaturgy,"By far, the BEST Austin Powers Movie!!",7,25 September 2003,"When I first saw the reviews of this movie, the trailers and the previews in the theater, I thought, ""Oh wow, has Austin Powers lost its edge."" But I was misled by the ""teaser"" trailers. I did not, as a result, see this movie in the theater, but instead waited for it to come out on video.My loss.This is by FAR, the best Austin Powers movie yet. This is supposed to be the last installment, the concluding chapter of the trilogy, as it were, but I hope that is not the case.Beonce was wonderful as Foxy. She's no Heather Graham, but that could be a good thing.This movie is wonderfully entertaining, with the original cast members of the first two (a rarity), and some nice surprises.It gets a 6.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
49,elshikh4,Not a Movie.. It's a Momentum of Dirty Sexual Jokes !!,2,4 July 2007,"(Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery - 1997) was nice, although just a joke after another, but they were good jokes. The sequel, (Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me - 1999), did nothing but repeating its original, with much of absolute dirty jokes, and heavy toilet humor. I didn't like it, however it did very well at the box office. HERE, in the third one, you won't find any respectable comedy at all, even by the Powers / Myers's measures!Save just the intro, it's a flood of pure filthy verbal or visible jokes. That kind of jokes is pretty easy and truly nauseating. So it's unfunny and disappointing too; based on the fact of having grins, not laughs, and the other fact of Myers who got no effective thing to present this round.I read once that the talent of comedy is a proof of being intelligent. In this movie, Myers confirms that he's turning into idiot. It's clear that he ran out of good ideas, so he simply chose to take the staircase of dirty jokes, but in this very case, he got the way down, making the worst Austin Powers movie yet.Now what you would say if you knew that there was more than 60 minutes of deleted scenes as well? Of course, the question would be: is it the REAL good thing which we've never seen of Goldmember?, or it is more and more of the gross-out comedy which we can get from any dirty-minded teenager with too much of empty time?!(Austin Powers in Goldmember) isn't a movie; it's rather a momentum of dirty sexual jokes. Myers hit the bottom of filthiness, ridiculousness, and tedium all at once, killing his franchise by his own hands. And the saddest part isn't that ""I didn't like it"", it's that ""I'm trying to forget it too""!",Austin Powers in Goldmember
50,billcr12,Myers and Beyonce,7,3 September 2012,"Goldmember is the third installment of the James Bond parody series with Mike Myers as the befuddled spy. The major casting addition is Beyonce, as Foxxy Cleopatra, in full afro wig , looking a lot like Pam Grier from Foxy Brown. She is an FBI agent working under as a disco singer. This time, Dr. Evil intends to use a laser beam to melt the polar ice caps and flood the world. Meanwhile, Powers is being knighted, and about to hook up with twins, Fook Mi and Fook Yu, when he hears of his father's kidnapping by Goldmember; a variation of Goldfinger. He and Foxxy team up to find his dad. They encounter a new villain, a sumo wrestler named Fat Bastard; played by Myers in a fat suit. We also are introduced to Austin's father, Nigel, and Dr. Evil's son, Scott. Mini-Me, the midget from the first two films is also back. Myers is very funny and adding Beyonce and Michael Caine to the absurdity, makes it worth the ride.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
51,dfranzen70,Austin is 'member' of gold-star club of coolness,8,1 August 2002,"Yeah, baby, yeah! Austin Powers returns after being an International Man of Mystery and meeting up with The Spy Who Shagged Me. The always hip Mike Myers reprises his tour-de-force role, playing multiple roles, including Austin's archenemy, Dr. Evil; and the loquacious, foul Fat Bastard.
This time around, Austin's just been knighted by the Queen of England - and his dad (a notorious no-show) isn't there to witness the great event. But no matter, soon Austin's off to stop the nefarious world-domination plot of Dr. Evil. Austin's transported to 1975 in a chic time machine and meets up with Foxy Cleopatra (Beyonce Knowles), a fellow agent. Foxy works for Goldmember, a sinister villain who happens to run a trendy disco club (where Foxy sings, of course). Goldmember's famous for his love of gold; his name stems from the fact that a certain part of his anatomy is golden, owing to a horrible smelting accident.Austin and Foxy know that Goldmember has been working on a plan for Dr. Evil, and they're sworn to stop him. That's about all of the plot you need to know now. There are some twists and turns, some absolutely hilarious. Along for the ride are, as in the past films, Seth Green as Scott Evil; Robert Wagner as Number Two, Michael York as Basil, and Verne Troyer as Mini-Me. Adding to the mayhem is Michael Caine with a somewhat smarmy bit as Austin's itinerant dad (although he's a bit under-used; just about any actor could have done the same in this role).The first thing one asks before seeing this film is, ""Will this be as entertaining as the first two films?"" The answer is yes, my friends, yes it is. There are a zillion jokes, and they're largely hit and miss, but those that hit are very funny. One of the misses is actually a hit, too - the opening sequence, which is a movie about Austin Powers - but not starring Austin as Austin, but rather an even more recognizable face, in one of many celebrity cameos.Any movie that has you rattling off its catch phrases as you depart the theater is a good movie, in my book. I kept saying, ""Oh, behave!"" even though there was no one else in the car. I even looked over at cars parked next to me at traffic lights, with my eyebrow raised and my mouth widening into a you-know-what grin. Yeah, baby, yeah! Wanna... shag?
Goldmember's a lot of fun. Oh, don't worry, it's not a thinking man's movie. It's gross and disgusting - farts and eating your own skin play into the plot. The jokes can be a little on the ribald side, but there's nothing much you should warn your kids about. For the most part, if your kids loved the first two Austin Powers films, then this one's fine for them to see.
Now, the cast. Myers is excellent as always in his multiple roles - in fact, I think there was more of him on the screen this time around than in the past, but that might have just been my own perception. Knowles, who's basically a novice when it comes to acting (she sings with the group Destiny's Child), is very appealing - spot on, as the Brits would say. ""My name is Foxy Cleopatra, and I'm a whole LOTTA woman!"" she tells Austin when they meet. Foxy's decked out in a big golden Afro wig and platform shoes - boy, who misses the fashion of the 70s, huh? - and peppers her speech with a lot of period slang.Only on celluloid could a guy with bad posture, terrible teeth, no dancing ability to speak of, a somewhat annoying bray, and a crooked haircut get all the hot women. I mean, look at this guy! In the first film, he got Elizabeth Hurley; in the second, it was Heather Graham. And now it's Beyonce Knowles! Who's next? Madonna?There were a couple of slow spots, but not very many. This one was a lot of fun, highly enjoyable.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
52,meeza,Still Randy Baby!,8,30 September 2002,"Guess who's back? Back again. Austin's back with more friends. Austin's back! Austin's back! Austin's back! Austin's back!  Yes, the shagiman show is back , and he still has his mojo. Mike Myers returns as Austin Powers, Dr. Evil, and Fat Bastard in the third installment of the Austin Powers franchise - `Austin Powers in Goldmember'. Even though it lacks the originality & creativity of the original, `Austin Powers in Goldmember' is still groovy baby. Just as in `The Spy Who Shagged Me', Dr. Evil is one million times more comical than Austin. How can I end my mini-film review without mentioning our favorite scene stealer `Mini-Me'? Yes, that very small man still delivers very big laughs. Oh! Yea Baby! There is a plot: Austin travels back to the 70's to rescue his father who has been kidnapped by the rollerskating skin-pealing villian `Goldmember', also played by Myers. Beyonce Knowles is Austin's lady sidekick in this one. She is no Liz Hurley, Baby. Myers should have `knowles' better and it should have been `destined' in selecting someone else for the part. All in all, `Austin Powers in Goldmember' is still one randy time at the movies. **** Good",Austin Powers in Goldmember
53,drqshadow-reviews,"Still Entertaining, This Franchise is Getting Awfully Crowded",6,10 March 2018,"Mike Myers is literally everywhere in his third romp as the super suave (and super dated) gentleman spy, playing four significant parts under hefty amounts of makeup and gear. He's still surprisingly funny, as is the film itself, although the screen often feels terribly crowded and the constant diversions and subplots get carried away. Much more than the two preceding films, Goldmember is a Python-esque collage, a string of skits and strung-out gags with a loose connecting narrative wound in-between. It's joyfully energetic, like a toddler, with an attention span to match. The goofs and send-ups themselves range from hilarious to beaten-to-death (particularly the dumb obsession with one character's absurdly huge mole, which is trotted out in at least three different scenes) and occasionally lean on a weirdly hyper-focused topical humor that's showing its age now. Many of the old bits from preceding films are rolled back out for an encore, but they're matched at least shot-for-shot with new segments that, surprisingly, hold their own. It's particularly important that the jokes land, because the plot is mostly scraps and stabs. Michael Caine is an inspired choice as Austin's long-lost father, but the two don't get much screen time together and it feels like a wasted opportunity. Beyoncé's take on the classic blaxploitation-era heroine type is spirited, if light and inessential. Despite the shortcomings, it's still good for a few big laughs and my wife and I reference it somewhat regularly. I prefer it to The Spy Who Shagged Me, though it can't hope to match the heart, balance or ingenuity of the original.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
54,r96sk,"Weakest of the three in my opinion, but",7,3 March 2021,"Weakest of the three in my opinion, but 'Austin Powers in Goldmember' still has some memorable moments.I enjoyed the star-studded and cameo-filled opening scene, it's well done. Mike Myers is again great in his roles, especially Dr. Evil, and Beyoncé Knowles is a positive addition. The stuff with Dr. Evil isn't as good as in the 1999 film, yet he still made me laugh a few times; he does have one of the series' best moments with the rendition of the Jay-Z song.However, I did feel a few pacing issues. All in all, it's still worth a watch. As noted, the cameos are solid - and let's just say they chose the perfect actor to play Dr. Evil...",Austin Powers in Goldmember
55,slokes,Mojo Meltdown,3,2 April 2006,"Mike Myers suffers from an unsteadying case of star bloat in this third installment of his Austin Powers spy-spoof series, banking on the fact that his fans will want to see even more of him than they have in the prior films. They did, judging from the box office ""Goldmember"" got, but in retrospect this seems more a coyote-woman comedy, something you chuckle at in the theater but leaves you feeling ill and ashamed the next morning.Austin Powers (Myers) is hot on the trail of a new bad guy named Goldmember (Myers again), who has kidnapped Austin's father Nigel (Michael Caine) as part of a vague scheme for flooding the world hatched by that dastardly supervillian Dr. Evil (more Myers) and assisted by Fat Bastard (still more Myers).Any film that features four times as much Mike Myers as Mike Caine is leaking bad mojo. ""Goldmember"" certainly lacks balance. From the lame cameos by Britney Spears and the Osbournes that speak to how old this Austin installment quickly got, to the goofy close-ups of Myers dragging out punchlines in one of his many roles, ""Goldmember"" is less a comedy and more a celebration of how big a star Myers has gotten to be, an impression deepened by a DVD commentary track with Myers and director Jay Roach.Roach gushes over Myers' on-screen performance and laughs at his lame jokes like a spineless courtier. Was this what happened on-set?""Oh, Jay, I'm going to do this thing with Goldmember where I eat my own skin and quote song titles from the '70s, after which I say the name of the artist who performed the song in a lower voice, because the only thing funnier than saying ""That's the way, uh-huh, I like it"" is saying ""KC & The Sunshine Band"" right after.""""Brilliant, Mike, um, Mr. Myers. If Peter Sellers was still alive, he'd die of jealousy. You're like Chaplin, only more poignant and athletically gifted. Um, you haven't left me off the points on DVD sales, have you?""Goldmember is Myers' first weak character in the Austin Powers series, a chance for Myers to don another disguise, busk his way through another accent, and make another play for Sellers' comedy crown. Yet the most he can manage is roller-dancing in wooden clogs and saying lines like ""I'm Dutch. Isn't that weird?"" He sucks up a lot of the script, and most of what's left goes to Myers' other characters, none of whom are developed much further. Austin has Daddy issues while Dr. Evil performs a rap number with his clone Mini-Me that seems to belong on the MTV Music Awards, not here.Caine seems wasted telling Viagra jokes as an unreconstructed version of Austin and revealing his hatred for two things, ""all people who are intolerant of other cultures, and the bloody Dutch."" He's AWOL for most of the movie, and when he reappears at the end, it's for such a lame scene you wish he had stayed gone.Verne Troyer is great as Mini-Me, though, the one character Myers seems to respect as much as his own, and Troyer delivers with broad and witty pantomimes. Beyonce Knowles is the best newcomer as blaxplotation queen Foxxy Cleopatra. Though she's horribly underwritten as the film raises the idea of spoofing the 1970s before dropping it, Knowles shows off some nice comedy chops along with a drop-dead cinched waistline.Myers, on the other hand, seems to be getting fatter, especially around the head. Perhaps Roach needs to stage an intervention. If he can direct Barbra Streisand, maybe he can pull Myers back to create another Powers film as funny and charming as the first two.",Austin Powers in Goldmember

This is just a continuation of sex symbol Austin Powers, and this was just bad. Michael Caine plays Nigel Powers, Austin's father. Myers now plays four characters, two of them uneeded. Golmember is his worst character to date, and also the sickest(he eats his own skin). One of the second movie's character's Fat B*stard shows up as a sumo wrestler in a part that should be a cameo. Unfortunately, they stretch it out into an extremely crude 6 minute part. Verne Troyer is Mini Me, who is probably the most amusing character. Several stars show up in cameos. The opening is about the making of Goldmember the movie(in a movie) starring Tom Cruise as Austin Powers, Gwyneth Paltrow as Dixie Normous, Kevin Spacey as Dr. Evil, Danny Devito as Mini Me, John Travolta as Goldmember and directed by Steven Spielberg. Avoid this movie please. It's not good. I did like the first one and the second one OK though.My rating-D(4 out of 10 would be an F, but that's not how my reviews work) Rated PG-13 for strong crude humor, some pretty mild sexual content, campy violence and some language. 88 minutes long.(wait till after the credits for Brittany Spears and Burt Bacharach)",Austin Powers in Goldmember
57,Agent10,Third time is a charm for Austin Powers,7,25 July 2002,"While the first two installments to this film series was fun and innovative, Mike Myers created something much more in Goldmember. Dance routines, outlandish set designs, wild clothing and one of the best opening sequences in the history of cinema (you can quote me on that!) help make this film a winner.Sure, it won't win any Oscars, but this is one of those films which encompasses more than just humor, but seeks to take it to another level. Technically, the film has very little to offer (with the exception of a few cleverly devised scenes), but the deadpan performances of Myers and Michael Caine and their interaction truly makes for some good comedy. While most of the movie feels like a collection of short vignettes, it does manage to flow succinctly and evenly. Overall, I would see this film multiple times.",Austin Powers in Goldmember

60,brando647,Austin Powers 3: Calling in Favors,6,30 October 2011,"In 2002, the Austin Powers series officially ran out of steam with its third installment, GOLDMEMBER. I had enjoyed the series until this point, but it's come to a point where I can't defend it anymore. Everything that was funny about the series has been run into the ground and the third film relies mostly on tired gags and an excessive amount of cameos. I'm not kidding; there are no less than a dozen cameos in this movie. The filmmakers were wise enough to realize that another film with just Austin Powers vs. Dr. Evil wouldn't cut it, so they've branched out to include a new villain (played by none other than Mike Myers, of course). This time around Dr. Evil has teamed up with the ""villainous"" Goldmember to hold the world ransom once again with a tractor beam. The two plan on using the tractor beam to bring a massive golden asteroid to Earth and colliding it into the North Pole, thereby melting the ice caps and drowning the world's nations. To neutralize Austin Powers, Goldmember has kidnapped Austin's father andwhat elsetaken him back in time to the 1970s to keep him secure. So now it's up to Austin and 70s blaxploitation FBI partner Foxxy Cleopatra to rescue Austin's father and save the world from Dr. Evil's latest scheme.I'm pretty sure Mike Myers and director Jay Roach had just given up at this point. There's nothing in this movie that we haven't seen more than enough in the other films. Shadow gags? Sure. An evil lair with Dr. Evil's face plastered comically on the outside? Absolutely, but this time it's a submarine. Dr. Evil's social ineptitude leading to a hilariously misnamed evil plan? He's labeled his tractor beam project Preparation H. You decide. Musical numbers? Plenty. It's all the same jokes regurgitated in a new setting. Puns, fart jokes, and an abundance of pop culture references. A Japanese businessman named Mr. Roboto? You think they're setting up for a reference to the Styx song---oh, there it is. *cue rim shot* I would've been happier if they could've at least found a way to avoid the over-used time travel plot device. It was the major plot in the first movie as Austin is a 60's swinger displaced in modern times. In the second film, a modernized Austin travels back to the '60s and confronts the lifestyle he left behind. Here, it's not even important to the story. Goldmember transports Austin's father to the '70s, Austin travels back to find him, and five minutes later all of them have returned to modern times. Done. So what was the point of even including a time travel sequence? Because this is Austin Powers, and an Austin Powers movie isn't an Austin Powers movie without time travel. Plus it was the only way to work a 70's blaxploitation character into the plot. Convenient, eh?I don't hate this movie. I was just really disappointed that they couldn't break away from the mold and try to do something fresh to keep the series alive. Everyone just sort of phoned it in here and the franchise has become a joke. How in the world did they ever get Michael Caine to agree to this film? Granted, he's one of the best parts of the movie. Seriously, a lot of people must've owed the filmmakers favors. In the opening alone, we're given Tom Cruise, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kevin Spacey, Danny DeVito, Steven Spielberg, Quincy Jones, and Britney Spears. And this is before the movie even begins. Enough is enough. I really enjoyed the first two Austin Powers films and I would love to see the franchise continue, but only if they're going to try and make it fresh. Drop the old jokes and drop some of the old characters. I think we've had our fill of Fat Bastard andI know I might be alone hereMini-Me. Goldmember's already worn out his welcome as a new character. His entire character is supposed to be funny just because he's Dutch. Seriously, most of his lines are reminders that he's Dutch (""Isn't that veird?""). He's a one-note character. Well, two-note if you account for the fact that he eats his own peeling skin for some reason. That's funny, right? It's time to create some new characters to flesh out the Austin Powers world, even if it's just Myers in a new costume. Don't be afraid to experiment a bit, but please don't crap out another cash-grab as obvious as this one.",Austin Powers in Goldmember

Austin Powers in Goldmemeber isn't in the trilogy curse. I don't think it's the best in the trilogy but it's still better than The Spy who shagged me. The reason why it's better is because it tones it down a little on the immaturity. Am I saying that the film isn't immature? No. I'm just saying that there's not as many gross moments. In the last film, they introduced a new character named Fat Bastard, who is in this film also. But not as much. Fat Bastard is absolutely gross, and one of the reasons why I didn't like it as much. Also, there is a scene where Austin drinks Fat Bastard's crap. And said it's a bit nutty. That's just gross. That was the humor that that film stuck with. i liked it, but it was very gross at times. Austin Powers in Goldmemeber is an improvement for many reasons. It makes you laugh a bit more. The jokes aren't that as crude and I prefer some of the new characters. Or, new character. Michael Caine, the great Michael Caine, plays Austin's father. Just the fact that Michael Caine is in it makes it an improvement. The fact that Scott Evil is turning evil is kind of funny. Austin Powers in Goldmemeber will make you laugh many times. Also, I prefer Beyonce over Heather Grahm. Heather Grahm wasn't bad, but I preferred Elizabeth Hurley and Beyonce. Austin Powers in Goldmemeber isn't a bad third part. It's one of the rare good third part. It's obvious that you should see it. The Plot: In the third part of this famous trilogy, Austin realizes that his father has been kidnapped and is being held in 1979. Dr. Evil and Mini Me are in prison. Austin travels back in time and reunites with his old girlfriend Foxxy, who is working undercover for Goldmemeber in the 70's.

The mojo is pretty much gone by #3, which even the presence of Caine (in the conceptually-inspired role of neglectful dad) can't save. Lack of chemistry between the leads, not enough creative effort, concept worn thin? You got me.

So, he made a deal with Dr. Evil to have the mad scientist transferred to the same prison Mini-Me is in exchange for getting him a criminal mastermind by the name of Goldmember. This takes the secret agent on a time travel trip to 1975, unaware Dr. Evil has plans that require Goldmember to be in the future, one involving a tractor beam and the Midas 22 meteor.Yeah, seeing this movie, it looks like they were beginning to run low on creativity. Mike Myers returns once again to portray Austin Powers and Dr. Evil, as well as new antagonist Goldmember, with Seth Green reprising his role as Scott Evil, and Verne Troyer reprising his role as Mini-Me. New characters include Austin's new sidekick, Foxxy Cleopatra, played by Beyoncé Knowles, and Nigel Powers, played by Michael Caine.Basically, the plot is messy at some points, as it just goes back and forth, and while it does has the same raunchy humor, it seems to have not aged well, and it adds some other unfunny jokes (like Dr. Evil being grossed out by Number Three, played by Fred Savage, because of a mole on his face). However, it still has some good moments (like the beginning dance, there's even the famous Godzilla scene). I have to admit, Dr. Evil's rap in the prison scene was funny, since it made fun of Eminem.

There are other cameos that pop up throughout the course of the film, and I felt they brightened up this otherwise mediocre comedy.
Every other gag in ""Goldmember"" involves farting, crapping or genitalia. It's a miracle it earned a PG-13.  Other than a hilarious rap duet of ""Hard Knocks Life"" between Dr. Evil and Mini-Me, in which they wear gold chains and party with half-naked women, the first half is pretty weak.  Most of it is spent trying to tie up loose ends, giving us backstories of Austin and Dr. Evil, even going as far as showing them as roommates back in college. Some of the plot is just plain silly.Every time someone asks me about this movie, the same question comes up: ""Can Beyonce act?""  The answer is yes.  She's a fine actress, and I wouldn't be surprised to see her in more and more movies.  Beyonce's acting wasn't the problem; it was the writing.  But to be on the bright side, the film strengthens towards the end with some hilarious bits, including one where Austin stands on Mini-Me's shoulders and they pretend to be one person. He gets summoned to deliver a urine sample.  Funny.  Then him and Mini-Me go behind a screen, and it appears in silhouette like Austin is masturbating. Very funny.  And there's another recycled bit from the second movie, where everyone looks up a spaceship shaped like a pair of boobs.
I liked the first ""Austin Powers,"" I loved the second one, but damn it it's time to retire the franchise.  The first movie set up the joke, the second one played along with it and now the joke is dead and Mike Myers is succumbing to a barrage of cheap toilet humor.  The ""Wayne's World"" franchise never tired out, because there were only TWO movies.
The character of Goldmember isn't that funny.  His running gag is that he talks funny English (just not funny enough to make me laugh).  He also collects his dead skin and licks it.  Disgusting, definitely.  Funny, far from it.  And I really wish they could've cast someone other than Michael Caine to play Austin's father.  Not that his performance is flawed; it's just I find it almost vomit-inducing to watch an incredible actor making bad penis jokes.Is there gonna be an ""Austin Powers 4""?  I hope not.  There are some cases, like in ""Lethal Weapon"" series, in which a movie is strong enough to spawn a couple of good sequels.  This is not one of those cases.
My score:  6 (out of 10)",Austin Powers in Goldmember
70,Victor Field,"Mr. Powers said it himself - ""That is SO not funny.""",3,13 April 2003,"""Austin Powers in Goldmember"" starts off with Steven Spielberg directing ""Austin Powers in Austinpussy"" with Gwyneth Paltrow as Dixie Normous (har de har har) and Tom Cruise, Kevin Spacey, Danny DeVito and another well-known performer - not revealed until near the end - in the roles played by Mike Myers, Mike Myers, Verne Troyer and Mike Myers respectively (oh, all right - Austin Powers, Dr. Evil, Mini-Me and Goldmember). In fact, the movie's insistence on cramming in several cameos in the first ten minutes along with an overelaborate ""Soul Bossanova"" musical number indicates a motif that runs through the movie - self-indulgence.I purposely avoided ""Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me"" as part of my refusal to see anything involving the presence of Madonna, but this movie might not have been much worse had she been involved. The storyline of Dr. Evil retrieving Dutch criminal genius Goldmember from the past (why?) and having him kidnap Austin's father Nigel as part of his plan to flood the world just lies there - the problem is that the movie knows it's a rehash and a send-up, and in gleefully playing up its phoniness (not least in Fat Bastard's joke about wire fighting) there's barely a single sincere moment in the entire movie, a fatal mistake given that father-son relationships are a major plot point.The movie's knowledge of its repetitiveness doesn't excuse its laziness either; had the jokes been funny it would have been another matter, but too many are DOA, tasteless or both. Plus it's hard to ignore the suspicion that Myers is enjoying himself a lot more than the audience (what was the point of the ""It's The Hard Knocks Life"" number with Dr. Evil and Mini-Me?), and Goldmember himself is painful and surplus to requirements. It certainly does well on the eye-candy scale - Britney, Gwyneth, Beyonce Knowles - but other than Seth Green as Scott, the only time the movie genuinely works is when it goes to 1975 all too briefly, featuring the only time Beyonce sings on screen in the movie and the movie's one truly hilarious scene (involving our hero having to talk to her through Nathan Lane). And just when you think it can't get worse, up pop the Osbournes...Since even ""1941"" was better, it's too bad Spielberg didn't direct for real. (And if I were George S. Clinton - who scored all three movies - I'd not be too pleased at seeing Quincy Jones conduct the scoring orchestra in the opening.)",Austin Powers in Goldmember
71,Beta_Gallinger,"Not usually that funny, definitely the weakest of the three",6,7 April 2009,"I remember the first time I saw this third installment in the Austin Powers franchise. It was New Year's Eve in 2002, and I was sixteen years old. Before then, I had only seen bits of the first two. (I never watch sequels to movies I haven't seen anymore, but sometimes did then.) My first viewing of ""Austin Powers in Goldmember"" was definitely a good one, so I watched the first two within the next few weeks after that, in reverse order. For a while, I was a big fan of the franchise, but watching the entire trilogy again in recent years, I have discovered that I now think the first one, ""Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery"", is the best, and the two sequels (1999's ""Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me"" and then this one), each brought the franchise down a step.As usual, Dr. Evil has another plan for world domination, but soon after he announces it to his colleagues, Austin Powers comes to arrest him! However, the British secret agent is soon informed that his father, Nigel, has been kidnapped, so he goes to talk to his foe in prison! He learns that a Dutch man from the 1970's known as ""Goldmember"" was involved in this abduction, so he travels back to 1975! At Goldmember's club, Powers meets Foxxy Cleopatra, an FBI agent working undercover. They witness Nigel Powers captured and taken through a time machine to 2002, so Austin then takes Foxxy back to 2002 with him. Dr. Evil and Mini-Me soon escape from their maximum security prison, and join Goldmember in a dastardly plot to cause a global flood! Obviously, it's up to Austin Powers and his new sidekick to try and stop them! Mike Myers played two roles in the first film (Austin Powers and Dr. Evil), and added a third alter ego (Fat B%$#&*%) in the second, so it's no surprise that he plays a fourth one in this third installment, Goldmember. I no longer care much for Fat B%$#&*%, which includes his appearance in this film, with scenes involving more toilet humour, and jokes about his sumo wrestling diaper, but Goldmember might be worse. I don't think I was ever a huge fan of his, but used to find him more acceptable. His exaggerated Dutch accent is supposed to be funny, but it's actually perhaps a little irritating. The film isn't completely straight-faced, it has its moments, such as Austin Powers unable to keep quiet about the mole on Number Three's face, and another crude shadow gag (like the one in ""The Spy Who Shagged Me""). However, the laughs in this film are still smaller in number than they are in its two predecessors, and it may get even more juvenile here than before. In the role of Austin Powers' sidekick, Beyoncé Knowles puts on a better performance than Heather Graham did in the first sequel, but that doesn't make this film superior.""Goldmember"" is obviously partially a spoof of ""Goldfinger"", the 1964 adaptation of the James Bond novel of the same name. Unfortunately, this third Austin Powers installment is far inferior to that third James Bond flick from 38 years earlier. On the other hand, ""Austin Powers in Goldmember"" is definitely better than ""Die Another Day"", the Bond film which came out the same year. If you ask me, that film, the twentieth installment in the franchise, and Pierce Brosnan's last outing as Bond of four, is undoubtedly the worst Bond flick to date! Nonetheless, this second sequel to Mike Myers' James Bond spoof showed that the series may be wearing thin, and although it's been nearly seven years since it came into theatres, it looks like a fourth Austin Powers movie has been confirmed. I'm not going to ignore it when it comes out, but since each of the two sequels brought the franchise down a step, it wouldn't surprise me if Austin Powers 4 brings it down yet another step, then it would follow the pattern.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
72,vip_ebriega,"Myers still has the 'Powers', baby!",8,13 May 2008,"My Take: The most elaborate and probably the funniest of the three.After the success of the first two AUSTIN POWERS movies, a sequel had to come out for the sake of the cash. And while it's meant to get a lot more money, AUSTIN POWERS: GOLDMEMBER, the third of the spy-spoof series, is still very funny, and you have to admit, Mike Myers still has the 'Powers'! Adding to his characters of Austin Powers, Dr. Evil and Fat Bastard, Myers also plays the new ""villain"", Mr. Goldmember, a parody of the famous James Bond villain Auric Goldfinger. The film, itself, is still a parody of all the classic James bond movies and many other movies. But, thanks to the creativity that's still intact upon the screenwriters, GOLDMEMBER still has enough funny bits to delight fans and other viewers that pass by alike. It may just be the the most elaborate AUSTIN POWERS yet.However, since it is done twice before, some things get pretty tired. It may be the most elaborate of the three, but the material certainly hasn't changed. Austin is still the same character he was in the first two films. Still has a thing for his fellow agents, always women, and he still has bad teeth, of course. Dr. Evil still wants to rule the world, and still coping with his relationship with his son (this time has improved, though). New characters include sassy ""sugar"" spy Foxxy Cleopatra (Beyonce Knowles), a parody of female blaxploitation spy characters like COFFY played by Pam Grier, as well as Austin Powers father (""His Fasha!"" says Goldmember in a Dutch-accent), played by Michael Caine, accompanied by the Mini Cooper he used in the role he played in the original THE Italian JOB.Director Jay Roach is still having fun with the material, and we have the same amount of fun he had. The comedy bits, although some repetitive, are still uproariously funny. The cameos of Tom Cruise, Gwyneth Paltrow, Danny DeVito, Kevin Spacey and director Steven Spielberg in a pseudo-M:I:2 opening credits of ""a new Austin Powers"" film called ""Austinpussy"" (a nod to Bond's OCTOPUSSY, which also rumored to be the film's working title) surprisingly funny, as i the long-running joke about the ""Mole"" (in a literal sense of the word). It's probably the funniest of the three so far. Go see it! Rating: **** out of 5.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
73,CharltonBoy,Is it as good as the last one? NO BABY!,7,12 December 2002,"Austin Powers Goldmember has all the hallmarks of the first two film. It looks great ,it is funny and it has no story worth speaking about.This is better than the first but does not quite live up to the second. The problem being the story is very week but what it lacks in a story it makes up for with gimmicks , none more so than the first 10 minutes when we see an array of stars making the Austin Powers film which is directed by Stephen Spielberg. Now thats a film i would love to see!! There are some very funny moments such as the time Austin is behind a screen and gives birth to Mini Me and the camio appearance of the Osbournes. When Mike Myers makes Austin Powers 4 i just hope he spends a little more time on the story. 7 out of 10.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
74,gbheron,A Weak Entry in the Series,4,8 January 2003,"The third Austin Powers movie offers the viewer little in originality. The few characterizations that work in ""Goldmember"" are not original and worked much better in the first two Austin Powers movies. The material that is new to ""Goldmember"" contributes little; it provides the weakest links in a weak movie.  Another criticism is that the comedy is significantly more crass and vulgar than in the first two. Where the predecessors had had some wit and style, ""Goldmember"" tends to rely on tired potty humor.
Unless you are a die-hard Powers fan and must see them all, skip it.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
75,jon.h.ochiai,"It's funny... Yeah, Baby",8,15 August 2002,"Jay Roach's ""Austin Powers in Goldmember"" is just plain funny. Mike Meyers is back and smashing as Austin Powers in this sequel. Meyers also wrote ""Goldmember"", and you've got to acknowledge him for rifling out the jokes. Not all of them work, and you really have to credit the misfires. The first 10 minutes of the movie which includes classic cameos from Tom Cruise (who is really great), Gwenyth Paltrow, and Britney Spears, is some of the funniest and off-the-wall movie-making ever.Dr. Evil (Meyers too) is back, and again threatening world destruction, though I can't remember exactly what for. I saw the movie a couple weeks ago. Austin must again go back in time, though this time to the mid-70's very cool disco era, to track down the Dutch villain, Goldmember (also Meyers). Along the way, he renews a relationship with an old partner Foxxy Cleopatra (Beyounce Knowles). One of the curious things is that Meyers keeps making unfunny Dutch jokes which goes on throughout the movie, and in doing so is hilarious. We also learn that Austin has an incomplete relationship with his father Nigel Power (perfectly played by Michael Caine). It is something that has cost him in the present. Will Austin complete this relationship with his father? Well, it is almost moving, touching, and inspiring. Almost.The actual story is secondary, and Meyer's script is like a bizarre stream of consciousness. Other highlights include a laugh until you can't breath Jay-Z rap parody by Dr. Evil and Mini-Me (Verne Troyer) in prison, and the scenes of Young Austin and Young Evil in prep school which is kind of a weird ""Smallville"" satire.One of the surprises is that the new villain, Goldmember, is not a big deal. Yeah, baby. Though Austin, Dr. Evil, Fat Bastard, Nigel Powers, and Foxxy Cleopatra are very good. Special props to Tom Cruise. ""Goldmember"" is not the greatest movie, but it is one of the funniest. Whatever you do, don't miss the beginning of the movie.",Austin Powers in Goldmember

77,stamper,Austin Powers reclaims his mojo,8,22 September 2002,"Goldmember is really much better than the first Austin Powers sequel, entitled The Spy who shagged me. Although there are some similar jokes, this one gets off much better. It seems that there are some standard sort of jokes, sequences or quotes that have been used in previous Austin Powers movies and will be used again in upcoming Austin Powers movies. Things like 'the laugh' by Dr.Evil and his crew, the 'shush thing' between Dr.Evil and his son Scotty or Austin's rambling when he finds something so amusing he must tell three jokes about it. All of this is very much like the standard lines and or fragments there are in James Bond films. The typical: 'Bond, James Bond' or the exploding stuff in Q's lab or even the Miss Moneypenny dialogues. Nonetheless, this film is enjoyable and exciting, more then it's predecessor and even a bit more than the original. The cause for that, is that there are more jokes that will make you laugh like an idiot (because the joke is idiotic) and because the actors are much better than in The spy who shagged me. Contrary to that film and very much in line with International man of Mystery, the casting has chosen for quality actors and actresses. There is no young number two and no Felicity Shagwell, who were not good and pretty but shallow respectively. Rather we have Foxxy Cleopatra and Nigel Powers. Beyoncé Knowles from Destiny's Child (Foxxy) succeeds in being Foxxy and in portraying a good and likeable character, whereas Michael Caine (Nigel Powers) also succeeds in portraying a good daddy Powers. Verne Troyer (Mini-Me) is even better than he was in The spy who shagged me. He was good before, but he is just hilarious this time around. Mike Myers (Austin/Goldmember/Fat Bastard/Dr.Evil) is as good as ever. I mean he is just great, making silly faces and putting on foreign accents. In spite of the returning characters and the new ones, there are quite a few celebrity cameo's, none of which were annoying by the way. If that alone is not reason enough to watch this film, I don't know what is. If even Britney Spears, the queen of actresses (smirk), does not succeed in f..king up this film , nobody will!!! I mean she is not too bad on the eye, but acting is nothing for her. That girl (woman maybe) can't so much as sing a note properly (unlike miss Knowles), so how can one expect her to act even average. She cannot even perform average in her own profession (or is her profession not singing, but rather walking around with very few, tight clothes???). In addition to the very good acting (this is a spoof you know!), there is lots of variation, for there are moments of pity, moments of wonder, moments of stupidity and a many moments of laughter. I can't wait for the fourth in the series (I know there will be one), but what will it be called?

78,The_Movie_Cat,"""They're using the same !@$$!@$ jokes that they did in the last Austin Powers movie!""",5,16 July 2008,"Having the characters in the film acknowledge that the format is stale does not disguise the fact, even if it's Ozzy Osbourne.While I rated both a five, this is a marginal further drop from The Spy Who Shagged Me, a further increase into its own sense of self and reheated jokes. I said when reviewing the original, and best, film that I couldn't decide who was funniest out of the two lead characters. This is virtually nul and void here, as while Austin still raises a smile, all the scenes with Doctor Evil are laboured, flat and badly paced. A new addition to Myers's cast of characters - the absurdly unfunny title character Goldmember - adds little to proceedings. An apart script editing blip even sees them use the humorous ""smelting accident"" gag a second time.Beyonce and Michael Caine add some spice to the film and there's a fun cameo role from Heroes's Masi Oka, but this is a franchise running on empty and really just stuck on repeat. Quite improbably, a fourth film is listed as being in production for 2009.

In fact, it's obvious the series is losing its steam, with jokes from the first films being only repeated over and over again (in essence, beating a dead horse). Even Mike Myers as Austin Powers/Dr. Evil seems to be growing tired of this role - and though his Fat Bastard role was funny, his new Goldmember role wasn't anything new.

82,Pedro_H,Lame recap of previous efforts with a bigger budget but ever cheaper gags.,5,24 February 2004,"Here we go again in a series that is not so much a spoof, as a spoof on a spoof. The original Austin Powers was more a spoof on In Like Flint (with James Coburn), Jason King and the other swinging sixties anything-goes James Bond rip-offs than the real 007 movies.The franchise isn't really a series of films as such, but a chance to showcase Mike Myers talents in a series of guises including, for the first time, a mad penis painting Dutchman - Goldmember - who strangely doesn't even know his own language from German!(Maybe that was a deliberate mistake - who knows and frankly who cares?!)A success has many fathers, but failure is an orphan. Good to see that now we are on a winner we have star day players onboard to remind us that they too wouldn't mind a hit franchise (or two) of their own.The greatest thing about the script is that the target audience hasn't seen the original thing and there are still loads of old Benny Hill sight gags to steal.(You've been caught baby, yeah....)Every time the writers (which includes Myers) goes back to the series they merely add to what they have created before without discarding much. Michael Caine is added as Power's (mostly absent) father and Beyonce plays a foxy blacksploitation sidekick (very well acted too - bang on the money!), but we have nothing really that new on the menu. The rule of thumb being that as the  gags get cheaper the sets get more expensive.No film has to be anything but a time passer, but what is evident here is that when you take away any element of danger or intrigue you have nothing to cling on to, even silly comedy needs a forward plot device.All-in-all a product  that is more interesting off-screen that it is on. A money making machine that doesn't want to stop because behind the face-pulling and the look-at-us-we-can laugh-at-ourselves we have a serious business. This won't be last of the series because we have money being made and while money is being made no Hollywood franchise will be dropped. The only alternative is that Myers gets tired of getting tens of millions for his so-so performances. Who knows - maybe he has hidden ethics? Let us hope so.",Austin Powers in Goldmember

The best scenes included Dr. Evil's prison rap video, and the suggestive subtitles in Mr. Roboto's office.  The several cameos were also enjoyable, especially Ozzy Osbourne pointing out the joke carried over from ""The Spy Who Shagged Me.""  The scene with Godzilla and its copyright was a relevant joke, considering the MPAA's temporary ban on the use of the title ""Goldmember.""  I did have a complaint about the continuity.

The first two movies were shot in the nineties, yet with Goldmember being shot in the beginning of the 2000's, it felt wasted to see another Austin Powers movie when other comedy flicks followed.The plot of Austin Powers 3 has the famous British super agent going back in time. This time around it's the 1970's where he must rescued his father Nigel, played by Michael Caine, who never really was around for Austin, when a villain by the name of Goldmember (Mike Myers in a fourth role with Dr. Evil being the second role and Fat B as the third), a Dutchman who has the ability to turn anything into gold including a man's twigs and berries. Austin gets help from a soul singer by the name of Foxy Cleopatra (Beyonce Knowles) along with getting help from convict Dr. Evil, but not before escaping with plans of his own.There are other characters that come back from the film from Fat Bastard (or Fat B. to the offensive people), Mini-Me, Number Two, Scott Evil and more where the real moments of the film just like the first two movies are the spoofs from spy movies to recent pop culture (Britney Spears, music videos, dance sequences and more) bringing out the true guns of comedy. There's even cameo appearances by major media influences from Tom Cruise, Gwyneth Paltrow, Steven Spielberg, Katie Couric, Quincy Jones, Masi Oki (before the Heroes fame) and more where it doesn't mean the better.I love Beyonce, but I didn't think she was the right choice to play Austin Powers' love interest where there wasn't any connection between them during their scenes together.Austin Powers was welcomed in the 1990's, but I'm not sure if the new century is ready for him.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
92,Spanner-2,A sporadicaly funny sequel,6,30 July 2002,"A sporadicaly funny sequel that I actualy enjoyed a bit more than the previous chapter (""Spy Who Shagged Me"") which I thought was dull. This one has Austin (once more played by Mike Myers) teaming with his dad (an amusing Michael Caine) to foil another plot by Dr. Evil. Some amusing cameo appearances and a hillarious turn by the talented Seth Green (who was all but ignored in the two previous chapters) make most of this watchable. Though the bodily function jokes and Myers mugging at the camera do get tiresome. GRADE: B-",Austin Powers in Goldmember

The movie is an amazing collection of jokes (two Japanese twinsisters who are called Fook Mi and Fook Yu, can it be better???) and parody on movies like ""Mission Impossible"", ""The Italian Job"" and tons of other things.

Non-tall people are given a more favorable light... almost, and Scott Evil -my favorite character- hardly does anything this time out.

Things were looking quite up from there, except that it fell down a deep hill as the movie went on.  The movie's plot is practically like the first two movie's plots.  Austin having fun, he time travels, finds Dr. Evil, bathroom jokes, and so on.  Austin Powers goes back to 1975 to find his kidnapped father.  He meets up with Foxxy Cleopatra, a cross between pam Grier and Tamara Dobson. I really didn't like her character too much.  She was funny at times, but she really was there for eye candy. Austin and Foxxy find a new foe, Goldmember.  A strange Dutch who isn't that funny and makes you cringe more than laugh.  They save Austin's father and must foil Dr. Evil and Goldmember's plan.  This movie is full of bathroom humor, sometimes funny, sometimes stupid.  They had some really good moments but not enough.

In this third installment of the Austin Powers trilogy, Austin Powers' (Mike Myers) father, Nigel Powers (Michael Caine) has been kidnapped by Goldmember (Mike Myers)! So then Austin goes to get information from Dr. Evil (Mike Myers) on where to found Goldmember and that was 1975. As Austin chases Dr. Evil, Mini-Me and Goldmember through time, he stops in 1975 to ""connect"" with an old girlfriend, detective Foxy Cleopatra (Beyonce Knowles), and requests her help to track the villains and save his father. In this movie Scott (Seth Green) finally decides to become evil and follow his father's foot steps! Dr. Evil's plan in this movie is that he is going to have a meteor hit the Earth by pulling it down with a magnetic laser. The funniest part in this movie is when we see Fat Bastard (Mike Myers) in a sumo-wrestling contest in Tokyo. Another funny part is when Austin and Foxy are at this place in Tokyo they were trying to talk to this guy and he is speaking in Japanese and some stuff keeps blocking the subtitles and it makes him look like he is saying nasty things! They were lots of other parts I liked! Another thing is that in this movie is that Dr. Evil finally gets what he had wanted which was sharks with laser beams attached to their heads.

100,SMK-4,Funny but disjointed,6,31 July 2002,"This is in many ways routine - well-made, with a good joke/time ratio, lots of the required silliness, and even a few moments of inspiration. Some new contributions to the series work better than others (Nigel Powers: good, Goldmember: bad), but by going through such a checklist one by one I make the same mistake the writers made: not thinking about the picture as a whole.As a whole, the film is too disjointed. There are good little tidbits here and there, mostly at the required hilarity level, but the joints squeak and squeal.  That is particularly noticeable towards the beginning when we get a few musical numbers too many.  Apart from this Burlesque-inspired combination of music and comedy, the disjointness can be blamed on several underdevelopments of plot and characters. The time travel to 1975 was confined to a few references of 1970s culture, the Goldmember character is largely side-lined, and Mini-me's defection deserved more attention.In the end, it's the Blazing Saddles school of comedy, not the more coherent approach of Support Your Local Sheriff.",Austin Powers in Goldmember

The new character ""Goldmember"" that Mike Meyers has created is pretty lame.  In the end there are some new things that work out, but there's also some dumb repetitve gags that you have either seen in previous Austin films, or old horrific SNL sketches.In a word, I wouldn't pay for this in the theatre If I knew this is what I was going to see, I'd probably be satisfied with a cheap rental though, and I suggest you wait and do the same.I went in wanting to let loose and just have a lot of laughs, but I can honestly say I didn't get my money's worth.Rating 5 out of 10",Austin Powers in Goldmember

After that, there's virtually no reason to keep watching--it's another `Saturday Night Live' sketch that goes on far too long. Mike Myers' indulgences remain as unchecked as ever which means that skits he thinks are funny, regardless of what anyone else might think, are included in all their humorless glory. Myers is probably the only comedian in movies today who doesn't seem to have the slightest notion about timing--all he wants to do is focus on scatological and homo jokes--and how he can be proud to deliver a comedy with so much dead air is beyond the ken of this reviewer. There are only two good lines and they are `Preparation H feels good on the whole' and `You're a cunning linguist and I am a master debater!'

103,troyputland,The lesser of the bunch...,5,2 May 2015,"Goldmember completes the Austin Powers franchise with little more than a nod to the 1st and 2nd films. The story's recycled again, Dr. Evil (Myers) insists on world domination, Austin Powers (Myers) awkwardly saves the day. It's not rocket science. Myers is up to his usual tricks; Evil garners the most laughs and Powers is, well, Powers. Mini Me gets the discriminated, but they're still just as funny. The 3rd installment sees two new inclusions, Beyonce Knowles's Bond-esque girl Foxxy Cleopatra, who lacks the emotional pull that Heather Graham had, and Michael Caine as Austin Powers' father, Nigel Powers, who fits his role suitably. Myers' Goldmember and the returning Fat Bastard fair less better. Still, Myers carries on doing what he does best, and that's making (most) viewers laugh.Check out my other reviews on http://straighttelling.co.uk",Austin Powers in Goldmember
104,barberoux,Crude but funny,6,9 December 2002,"""Goldmember"" was funny in parts and was mostly entertaining throughout. Mike Myers was very good and so was Beyoncé Knowles.  The story was a parody of many old spy movies and 1960's action movies.  Unfortunately the tone of the movie seems to be more and more scatological.  I find that humor rather juvenile and to be a product of poor writing and a lack of inspiration. Maybe they are trying to attract a certain younger cruder audience but it would seem they are alienating a large portion of market.  I'm not looking forward to the next episode since the jokes lost their interest when I graduated from grammar school.

When I saw this at the cinema four years ago, I was surprised to see the Austinpussy film-within-a-film but I soon realised it was part of the actual film itself.Beyonce makes a great sidekick for Austin and she is especially helpful in the scene in Mr Roboto's Headquarters where the subtitles look dogdy (for example, ""Please eat some s**t,"" becomes, ""Please eat some shitake mushrooms.). One of the best puns in this film is the name of Gwyneth Paltrow's character, which is Dixie Normous. My dad found that name terrible yet funny. I also liked the scene where the Japanese twins ask for Austin's autograph and they tell him their names are Fook Yu and Fook Mi, which is similar to the Dixie Normous joke, but they sound a lot ruder because they sound like the F-word.People who already like the first two films may like this as well because it's just plain hilarious. 9/10.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
108,SMLA11,"Hilarious, but the weak link in the trilogy",7,27 July 2002,"(There could possibly be spoilers, so read at your own risk.  And if they are spoilers, they're not big)This movie was hilarious, no doubt saying that.  But it is definitely the worst of the three.  It's not as fresh as the first, or as original of jokes as the second, but it still has its great moments (The cameos were hysterical).  Although some cameos didn't deliver anything but stupidity. Can somebody answer me, what the hell was Britney Spears and the Osbournes doing there?!?  I didn't hear a single laugh out of anyone in the audience when those two cameos arrived.  Here are my pros and cons of the movie:Pros: 1.  Once again, the hilarious cameos.  I will only say that Danny DeVito's was hysterical. 2.  Fat Bastard (who, surprisingly, isn't there long enough)Minime, and Dr. Evil steal every scene they are in.Cons: 1.  Once again, the useless cameos. 2.  Goldmember, was not funny whatsoever besides his strange dutch accent. He was there to gross you out with his skin problem. 3.  Foxxy Cleopatra was unfunny also and is just there to wear cleavage (I didn't mind but she was the worst girl of the three).  4.  Ridiculous and sometimes, just stupid, bathroom jokes.  5.  They steal many of the past two movies jokes and put them in this one, which was aggravating.6.  The absence of Heather Graham's character wasn't a good thing.  7.  Michael Caine's character was a little bit aggravating but had many funny jokes.  8.  Last but not least, the worthless ending.  I was so anticipating the ending to see what happens, but it ends up stupid.So as you can see there are many more cons than pros but I will still recommend you to see it, but only if you like bathroom jokes, which I don't.

109,bazmitch23,"Good, but not the best of the bunch",7,4 May 2013,"Granted the opening is the best of the trilogy, but then it doesn't hold up to the first two. I never found the character of Goldmember funny. He's just a weird guy who makes a movie or disco reference and then says the name of what he is referencing. And this is also the decade where penis jokes were wearing thin. It was funny in the 70's and 80's, the 90's they got tiresome, in the 2000's it's like ""Okay, enough."" The joke where Fat Bastard talks about his terrible problem with obesity, sad music plays and then he farts worked in the second film, but in this movie, we saw it coming. Then he describes what the fart smells like. That's not funny.Yeah, there's many moments where it just Mike ad-libbing and it gets put in the movie. The filmmakers may have found it funny, but the audience doesn't. It's times where it's like the filmmakers only care about what they want, instead of the audience. Which what you're supposed to be doing if you're a filmmaker.The object in space that looks like a private part was funny in the second film but here, not so much. And the joke about the mole is just not funny.However, the movie is fun and fast paced, the score was great and it was just epic. I like it when silly comedies get epic. The joke about the subtitles was hysterical, the scene where Austin and Mini-me are behind the screen was hysterical, Beyonce was really good as Foxxy and yes I was surprised at the twist at the end. I went to see this film twice. The second time, I saw it with my friend and his jaw dropped opened at that scene.Is it the best of the three? No, I think the second film is the funniest.

It has to be said that the Austin Powers series is fairly unique in having each of the three films be *better* than the preceding one. But, it's still your standard spy-film spoof, and the whole thing gets a bit tedious in the end. Because, strangely, it doesn't need any of that. The various cameos and interludes are great on their own -Evil Scott, the Belgians, speaking English English, all great skits, i guess you do need a framework to put them in, so comedy-James-Bond is has to be.Anyway, decent film with some very unique touches.

As a matter of fact the first half of the film is very good, unfortunately, it fails to maintain the same creative energy, when Myers goes back to using bodily fluid jokes ad infinitum.The character of ""Goldmember""(Mike Myers),threatens the world with demolition, if his demands are not met.Austin Powers teams up with his father Niles Powers(Michael Caine)and Foxy Cleopatra(Beyonce' Knowles), Austin's current Love interest, to defeat Goldmember, Dr. Evil and the rest of the Clan.Their adventures take them thru time to the swinging 60's and back to the present, with a major twist in Dr. Evil's lair near the end !Michael Caine has great comic timing, when he has material to work with, he should have been given more. Beyonce' steals her scenes with terrific moves and talent that just radiates from the screen . Verne Troiyer is wonderful as the vertically challenged Mini-Me. Watch for the transformation of Seth Green into a Ron Howard lookalike.Unfortunately, with all of the Star Power, the script lags the talent, and you have too many people , standing around as filler.

They were fresh and very funny stories. Myers was just incredible, one of the truly great comedic performances of all time. However, this third installment is just plain terrible! Can you say ""milk it""? Well here they have milked it bone-dry. I cannot begin to describe all of the problems with this pathetic film, but here are a few. There is no story, or at least not much of one. Too many worthless cameos. Speilberg and Cruise don't make this movie funny by just being there. Brittany Speers is only funny when she tries to be serious. Paltrow has a cameo for no reason at all. Worthless additions to the cast. Michael Caine and Foxy Cleopatra do not do anything approaching comedy during the whole film. Moreover, the movie barely features at all the supporting characters of Dr. Evil's gang from the first two movies. Those were the people that made this series a hit. There is nothing that was good about the first two films in this one. This film looks like a rushed, slapped together, piece of garbage. There is no heart or brain. Many parts of the movie were very flat and looked rather stupid. Often, the film has to resort to crude sexual anatomy jokes for cheap laughs. I did laugh at some parts of this film. Myers is one of the most gifted comedians ever, you have to laugh at some stuff. Moreover, I thought his Goldmember character was funny and not used enough. But overall, this movie plays like a bad series of SNL skits. There is a part in the film were Ozzy (yet another worthless cameo) complains that this movie is just rehashed and reused jokes.

118,ryan_kuhn,Austin Should Have Stopped At One,5,13 February 2005,"I really enjoyed the first Austin Powers (Mike Myers) movie, Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery. It was fresh, even though it was a retread of the James Bond movies, but more importantly it was funny. It was funny because a 60s swinger was in the politically correct 90s and have a very hard time fitting in. The second movie, Spy Who Shagged Me, was not as good as the first, mainly because it takes Powers back to the 60s, losing it's primary source of humor. Now, we have this train wreck of a movie, Austin Powers in Goldmember, a movie that looks like a boat who has lost it's rudder. The only interesting character in the movie is Austin Powers' father, played by Michael Caine, but is sorely underused. The Powers' babe of this movie is Beyonce, playing Foxxy Cleopatra in a Pam Grier-esquire homage to the blaxploitation movies of the 70s, though I do not remember a skin-eating Dutch man running Studio 54 in New York, or what ever the movie was parodying in that scene. The movie almost looks like there are too many ideas crammed into the 94 minutes of running time. The highlight of the movie is the first 5 minutes, when there are surprise cameos playing familiar characters, but the joy and surprise is done early, and the movie goes downhill from there. I do not know why Myers thinks it's cute to have Dr. Evil do silly musical numbers, or why mole jokes are funny. So much is wasted by the last two Austin Powers movies that it's really a shame. Sure there are funny moments. My favorite was when Godzilla is crashing through Tokyo (don't ask, it's not that important), but the laughs are few and far between. If there is a forth Austin Powers movie, let's hope that they get back to the basics, Austin Powers trying to figure out where he is in life when living in the 1990s or early 2000s, still trying to figure out how Liberracce became gay.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
119,MF210,Sometimes the comedy is inventive and sometimes its derivative,6,7 December 2003,"My Rating: **1/2 out of ****.The third film in a movie trilogy is most of the time the worst. Austin Powers in Goldmember definitely proves that point. This is not a bad movie but it clearly shows in areas that Mike Myers was running out of ideas.
The first two Austin Powers were enjoyable and fresh. Mike Myers clearly showed that he was talented. Goldmember is watchable but not always fresh. The viewer will clearly see that some jokes from the second film are reused here and they are not funny this time around. The behind the tent joke is there (when it looks like Austin is doing something nasty but really is not) and a boob satellite joke (Replacing the penis rocket from the second one) are not really funny here.Then again there is somethings inventive here. There is a clever bit when Austin is talking to the head of a Japanese corporation and the subtitles are cut off by an object to make it look like something dirty is being said. That was particularly funny. The beginning is certainly inventive and very cool and funny.Mike Myers gave 2 performances in the first Austin Powers(Austin and Dr. Evil) and 3 performances in the second (Austin, Dr. Evil, and Fat Bastard). Myers is trying to outdo himself here by giving 4 performances by adding a new character called Goldmember. Alot of people said he was really pushing it when he added Fat Bastard in the second film but I thought Fat Bastard offered his share of laughs. However, Goldmember is a mockery of Dutch people that seems more offensive and irritating than funny. Besides Goldmember, I mostly enjoyed watching Myers.Beyonce Knowles is the new girl alongside Austin. Knowles is not bad but she is not as good as Hurley and Graham were. Michael Caine is fine as Austins Dad but the surprise ending when he reveals a ""shocker"" is lame.Despite some derivative comedy and a lame ending, Goldmember is worth watching. I dont know about an Austin 4 though. This series seems to be running out of ideas.",Austin Powers in Goldmember

I'm not a fan of feces eating, urinating in another's mouth or multiple penis jokes. This film does have enough other goodies to make it worthwhile and a lot of fun. To fully appreciate this gem, I recommend viewing it on blu-ray DVD. You will get awesome sound and crisp, sharp and extremely colorful visuals. This is one of the most colorfully dazzling films ever. The songs and music score are fabulous, the sets are eye-poppingly flamboyant and excellent, the costumes sparkle and shine. Many of the jokes are hilarious, the story is clever and Mike Myers playing 4 different roles is amazing. The cast in this series has always been perfect and a lot of fun.

I have to admit that I didn't get to the end of one of the many showings on the TBS Network which appears to be uncensored if not uncut (no pun intended.) since I'd really lost interest some time before.I didn't really like the first Austin but it was, at least, watchable.

122,TuckMN,"Utterly lacking in charm, wit or humour.",2,30 July 2002,"While I certainly don't expect sophistication from Mike Myers the tiniest bit of wit or charm would have been appreciated.With endless pratfalls and jokes that I stopped laughing at when I was still in grade school this mess has to be one of the worst films I have ever seen.The Austin Powers franchise has definitely  been played out and deserves to be buried -- deep.There are innumerable cameos by good actors that really should have known better.It amazed me how a fat paycheck will allow actors to permit themselves to be humiliated beyond belief.One surprising bright spot was Beyoncé Knowles as Foxy Cleopatra bringing, at least, beauty and sly humour to an otherwise thankless part.There was a second bright spot -- when `The End' flashed on the screen.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
123,michael_the_nermal,Thankfully the End of Austin Powers,2,29 January 2009,"Just as one would expect, the ""Austin Powers"" movies got lamer with each showing. The first was alright: it wasn't the best comedy in the world, but at least Dr. Evil was amusing to listen to. The second catapulted Mini-Me into the pop culture landscape for a time, but was a passable effort with not much that was funny. The last ""Austin Powers"" movie (so far) is the worst. Mike Myers really strains himself to make the characters work, with little success. The jokes and writing were dreadfully uninspired and lacking in any form of wit (except for the final scene with the fat guy; I won't ruin it, and that's why I awarded an extra star to ""Goldmember.""). Very boring. Michael Caine doesn't really do much as Austin's father; not an interesting character in the least. Austin is boring, and Dr. Evil and Mini-Me doing hip-hop in prison looks so trite and unoriginal that I wonder why people who write these movies make oodles of cash. The character of Goldmember sucked. His accent and quips were the stupidest things I've ever heard. You can probably create better comedy in your sleep, and it would be better than the character Myers has created.This movie also has the most blatant product placement I've ever seen. It's already bad enough that there are TV commercials for cars and chewing gum before the previews; why do we need advertising IN the movies. Yeah, the movie makers stand to make a fortune, but it really shows how utterly crass movies have become.Steven Spielburg, Gwenyth Paltrow, John Travolta and Britney Spears make cameos, showing how in love with itself and out-of-touch with reality Hollywood is. Let's hope that this film is the last we'll see of Austin Powers for some time.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
124,rob-236,Doesn't strike Gold,4,18 August 2003,"Easily the lesser of the series, its probably about time Austin bottled his mojo and retired. Lame joke after lame joke masquerades as a storyline in this 3rd outing for the goofy James Bond wannabe. Myers plays no less than 4 characters here, but again - its Doctor Evil that steals the show.Worth watching only for the hilarious cameos at the beginning and the gorgeous Beyonce Knowles, who proves that she can actually act as well.All in all very average, but anyone under 16 will probably love it.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
125,Jdc102,Not bad for a third version...,6,29 July 2002,"There are a lot of people that are complaining about this movie. First of all, yes, this movie has some potty humor, but all of the films had it (But this has the most, by far..) but this BY FAR has the best Austin Powers opening and anyone that would give it away is pure evil, baby!  Besides, what do people want from an Austin Powers movie? A LIFE CHANGING EVENT?  If your expecting CITIZEN CANE or THE GODFATHER, I think you shouldn't even buy your ticket.. Anyways...I liked a lot about this movie. I thought Foxxy Cleopatra was a great character and Beyonce did a great job for her first film.  Michael Caine was great as Austin's Dad and just like the 2nd version, Verne Troyer stole the show. Its kind of sad in a way that they seem to be making fun of him, but keep in mind- The guy is the one whos laughing, with endorsements and stuff- he's a millionaire by now..Dr. Evil is great as usual, and I liked the new character of ""Goldmember"", who yes is very gross, but not half as bad as ""Fat Bastard"", who was so not funny in this movie.. Note to creators: If you're going to make a fourth version, feel free to write out this character- Unlike Dr. Evil and Austin- he's getting old, and has only been around for 2 versions..Anyways, I don't have that many complaints except I would have wished they would have explained what happened to Felicity Shagwell and I really would have wished ""Mustaffa"" would have made yet another comeback.With the great writing, I think they could make another version. Austin could go in the 80's and the new ""Austin Girl"" could be Britney Spears.. Just a thought..Thanks",Austin Powers in Goldmember
126,RickHarvey,Austin's still got his mojo,7,16 April 2010,"When films series reach their third instalment, many bolts and nuts start to come lose . However this is not a case with Goldmember which shows us that Austin Powers still has his Mojo. The horny spy is back. He may of lost some of his freshness but there no doubt he still delivers. If anything gold member is possibly the best instalment in the series.Mike Myers is still great as Austin powers. Just like the last two, he does the usually stuff you come to expect that's including making you horny. Micheal Cane also makes an appearance as Austin's dad which to me, was brilliant. The gags are what you expect from Austin, as one or two gags are reused from previous films but despite this they are still hilarious . Basically, Goldmember is everything you expect. Dr evil, his evil henchman, Mini me, Fat bastard, scotty are all still major characters.Now when it came to beyonce being Foxy, Mr Powers sexy partner, i was on the fence. Beyonce to me, wasn't the best choice but then again, she just there so that Austin can still crack a rude joke now and then. The arrival of The Dutch was flat. seeing as he plays a big part in the film, he is easily forgettable compared to other characters. Even though the gags still make me laugh, they are easily associated with the gags from the previous two films as there only several of new, unique gags.Goldmember is another proud entry into the series which still shows that Austin is still groovy and has got plenty going for him. Despite reused gags, he can still make you laugh out loud which makes me come to the conclusion that Austin Powers is now one of movies biggest icons and after watching him for over four hours now on all three films, I don't care if i watch him for another four hours in new material because Austin always delivers and Goldmember proves this The same goes for Dr evil, i hope i'll still be here when he up to destroying the world for the hundredth time.",Austin Powers in Goldmember

This time around, Austin Powers has to travel back to 1975 to rescue his kidnapped father from the clutches of Dr. Evil and a new villain, named Goldmember.

The gag began to wear thin about 15 minutes into the first movie; now it's just a mercilessly flayed and pitiful wretch that's crying out for someone to put it out of its (and our) misery.It's so bad that Myers has to emphasise when he's made a deliberately lame joke (mistaken though he is for believing that any of the others aren't lame). A comedy that needs to plead for its laughs is a tragedy.I only made it to the end because I thought that a comedy with a budget this big must have a smile in it somewhere.

129,w00f,"A Few Chuckles, but Mediocre",5,27 July 2002,"I loved the first couple of Austin Powers movies, and this one wasn't terrible either, but there was nothing outstanding about it.  It recycled a lot of material from the first two Powers flicks in a self-conscious way. It's getting harder to tell whether Mike Meyers is parodying film clichés or falling into them himself.  This one contained even more poo-poo and pee-pee jokes than the first couple, to the point that it got tiring 3/4 of the way into the movie.The accent Meyers chose for the title character got very annoying a few minutes after the first time he spoke.  Meyers has a lot of talent for this sort of thing, but Goldmember's accent came across as contrived and a bit stiff, like Meyers was trying too hard.Michael Caine is a lot of fun as Austin Power's father, Nigel Powers.  It was obvious from his performance that Caine was having a very good time on the set.  The Cockney ""private conversation"" between Caine and Meyers is one of the high points of the movie.Personally, I think this series is getting tired.  Meyers should consider moving onto a fresh project instead of milking the Austin Powers character for all he's worth.  The ending of Goldmember makes it abundantly clear, however, that there's going to be another sequel.  I don't know if that's such a good idea... I felt after seeing this one, while I did have a few laughs, that Meyers is getting close to taking the easy way out as far as coming up with new material.  His time would be better spent, I think, going in a new direction.  Maybe its time for a Deiter movie?",Austin Powers in Goldmember

131,rooboy84,Pretty damn good.,6,7 October 2002,"""Goldmember"" is a rare sequel that not only stands up to the first and second, but beats them.May be minor spoilers ahead: A rare sight indeed is that a sequel can be this good, as we've rarely seen it happen, as movies like Jurassic Park 3, Tremors 3, Honey I blew up the kid and more have failed to get any where near the original. But with Goldmember, it topples the other 2 movies.With Fresh new characters, different twists and some old (but funny) jokes thrown into the mix again, it's simply not possible not to laugh, especially with such characters as Mike Myers involved. Special effects are great, especially Dr.Evils underwater sub-marine lair.With cameos from big names, you'll be laughing out loud and trying not to disturb the audience(chances are they'll be laughing, too)
Beyoncé Knowles is stunning in a hilarious movie. Goldmember isn't as sexy as the other two movies, but you will not be dissapointed, especially if your a fan of Mike Myers.I applaude the cast and crew and everyone to do with Goldmember.5 out of 5 stars.",Austin Powers in Goldmember

When you know that the bad guys in real life do not harm you because you are from the Moonfleet orbiting Earth it makes for camp humor.

May we Humans serve the Creator loyally and always keep Him or Her entertained. Since I went to a Catholic High School, have taken Catholic Communion and represent the Archangel Michael to our Creator I am sort of an undercover Catholic and Anglican at the same time since my DNA with time travel may have been sent back in time a very long way. I have tried to pass on the message of fear not always. The Messiah is on Earth now and I am protecting her. She came from the Moonfleet, is incredibly smart and has a computer inside of her from the Creator. Thanks to sending messages back through time this Princess of Peace through Conquest of the Universe by our Creator who is in several Galaxies already, the Messiah knew that she was going to be crying a day in advance because her computer played recordings of her crying over and over again.

135,mweston,2.5 stars (out of 4),6,15 October 2002,"The plot is not really important. Essentially all of the characters from the previous film are back, except that this episode's female sidekick is Foxy Cleopatra (singer Beyoncé Knowles). Star Mike Myers has also added a new character named Goldmember, who lost his, uh, member in ""an unfortunate smelting accident"" and likes to eat the pieces of his skin that flake off regularly. He is also Dutch, which provided numerous opportunities for Dutch jokes, which aren't funny but are *supposed* to be because they aren't. Visually he reminded me a bit of Arte Johnson.Also new is Austin's father, played by the *ideal* British actor (I won't reveal who) for the part. He helped fill in some of Austin's history and was generally good in the role, but I couldn't help but feel that something was missing.One good scene involved the use of subtitles when some characters were speaking in Japanese. Specifically, the white subtitles were made partially invisible by a partially white background. This being an Austin Powers film, the remaining letters spelled out dirty jokes, but the fun part was that the characters were aware of the subtitles, reading them and taking steps to eliminate the white background so that they became legible. It wasn't actually the funniest scene in the film, but perhaps the most inventive.But for me the two things that worked the best were 1) the cameos by some *really* big stars, and 2) the musical numbers. Maybe halfway through the film I thought that it was basically a musical, but unfortunately as the plot (such as it was) got going, the musical numbers dropped off. And since the cameos were also concentrated up front, I found this to be a film that promised a great deal but then mostly failed to deliver. Still, the best scenes make it marginally worth seeing, and if you liked the second film, you'll like this one.Seen 7/25/2002 at the pre-opening party for the Camera 7 theater (in which I am an investor), at the PruneYard in Campbell, CA.",Austin Powers in Goldmember

The first half is really funny (""Master Evil"" ""Fook Mi"" etc.) but the characters get old pretty fast, and Goldmember, the Dutch villain, just isn't funny.  Part of the problem is that we're too familiar with Austin, Dr. Evil, Mini Me, etc., and part of it is the 1960's spy formula is wearing thin.  I hope this is the last one, the first two are great and worth seeing, but see this one only if you must see the third installment.  6 out of 10.",Austin Powers in Goldmember

NO, and this installment proves it with some of the most tired jokes and bad acting seen in recent history. You'd think that since this is the 3rd movie, they'd try to create some original laughs. While they do introduce two new characters (that aren't funny in the least) the jokes have been recycled from the first two Austin Powers ""films"" and quite a few other comedies from the past. Basically what we get is a much worse Austin Powers. Yes, I said worse if you can imagine that.Mike Myers shtick as Powers is simply old and no longer (if it were ever) funny. ""Goldmember"" one of the new characters, is so unfunny its pathetic. His whole punch line is that 1.) he skates 2.) he can contort his body in all sorts of odd positions and 3.) he's evil. Beyonce Knowles is even unfunnier. She needs acting lessons, bottom line. Her comic timing is so off that it's pathetic, I even felt embarrassed for her. Stick with what you can do half way good, sing. Notice I said ""half way"" (I'm trying to be nice).Everything here is old. That oh so witty father/son banter between Dr. Evil and Scott is so tired and lame, it just got on my nerves after a while. This movie shows without a doubt how tired Austin Powers is. I just hope the public notices and there isn't yet another sequel then God help us all...Austin Powers 3 is simply 90 minutes of complete and utter stupidity that isn't funny for 1 micro second.

And yes I was right, the movie did not live up to the hype that was made about it. It didn't have the same feel to it.Austin's character ended up telling flat jokes and wasn't very interesting. Foxxy Cleopatra wasn't terribly exciting as a ""Powers"" girl either, with more ""Don't go there girlfriend"" neck manouveres than actual great lines. Dr Evil ended up being a complete pansy, despite having some humourous moments. Scott Evil wasn't funny at all, a complete personality makeover unfortunately didn't have it's intended affect. Was Frau Farbissina in this movie at all? Maybe a couple of face shots but that's about it!! Nigel Powers was completely useless, he had potential that got lost along the way. Fat Bastard was ok but again a let down, I think his fat rolls were more interesting in ""The Spy Who Shagged Me"". Mini-Me was better than the whole lot of them, providing some of the original Austin Powers magic into a less than shiny ""Goldmember"". Speaking of Goldmember...did they even utilise the purpose of his character?? Why did they bother naming the movie after a character who barely makes more than a 20 minute appearance altogether?There were too many celebrity cameo appearances, I only enjoyed the Tom Cruise, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kevin Spacey, Danny DeVito, Steven Spielberg and John Travolta appearances. How you know that the Austin Powers franchise truly lost it's ""Yeah Baby!"" appeal is by stooping so low as to allow the likes of Britney Spears to even be allowed on the set let alone appear in the movie. Thank god they blew her up in the movie, maybe it was suppose to epitomise the state of her not-so-hot career anymore? Hell, Burt Bacharach is better to watch!! Please no more of the Osbournes, the joys of say the ""F"" word probably went away in the late 50's.So despite some...and I mean SOME funny bits, the movie is pretty forgettable.

Dr Evil was a complete pansy, his jokes completely faltered, nothing of the fun villain we came to love. Why name a movie ""Goldmember"" when the title character appears only for about 20 minutes? Mini Me stole the limelight from everyone, giving us some glimmer of the previous ""Austin Powers magic"". Nigel Powers was completely useless, lacking any sort of interest that the father of the International Man of Mystery would have had.

It tries too hard to be funny most of the part. The jokes weren't as good as before but the action performed, mostly something to do with bathroom nature were really funny. But that doesn't come until half way into the movie.Beyoncé Knowles's acting was not that bad but her character wasn't as memorable as Elizabeth Hurley and Heather Graham and Beyoncé's character didn't have as much chemistry with Austin Powers as they did. I know she's not an actress but her character was easily forgettable. Also there wasn't any memorable lines Austin Powers said in this one besides the ""mole"" thing.I thought all the original characters were funnier in Austin Powers 1 & 2 except for Mini-Me. He made this movie a lot funnier. His performance stood out more then anyone else in the movie no matter what his size is. Mini-Austin was hilarious!The jokes weren't as funny but their performance saved it. Overall storywise, characters, and humor, I thought Austin Powers 2 is the best.

Three rather large areas!So is it just me, or was this Austin Powers movie a take on other Austin Powers movies?  I could see in the second film, they had lost some originality with putting in Dr. Evil for a second time.  Why couldn't they have introduced more interesting villains.  The Goldmember villian is quite annoying, and will never rival the Dr. Evil from the first movie.  But I didn't appreciate the usage of Dr. Evil and Mimi-me again in this 3rd installment, because their characters seemed more like actors having fun rather than well-developed characters.I thought Austin Powers 3 would find some new areas in the Austin Powers universe.

145,tmpj,A Little Bit of a Let-Down...but..still funny !!,5,7 July 2010,"This, the third installment of the Austin Powers series--energized by the very hilarious Mike Myers--is a little bit of a letdown. It did not have the same energy as the two installments that preceded it, and--despite the addition of some good cast members...it would seem that Myers started to run low on gas with this one ( or as Austin would shout after a photo session: ""I'm Spent !!""). Beyonce had good screen presence as the composite character ""Foxxy Browne"", an obvious throw-back to the so-called ""Blaxploitation"" flicks of the 70s. Myers even drives a ""Pimp-mobile"" and dresses in the fashion of ""Super-fly"". But, there is no on-going romantic connection with Austin and Foxxy, and that is a bit of a bummer...especially after having seen Austin feed directly off the energies of Vanessa in flick one, and Felicity Shagwell in flick two. To-day's audiences are more accepting of an interracial on-screen love affair than ever before, so I am wondering why that was not written in as part of the story. But it hurt for Austin not to have an on-going relationship so that he could engage in his usual bravado concerning his ""Mojo"". (If Muddy Waters is watching from Blues Heaven, he is laughing his head off at that !!) ""Goldmember"" is a character based on ""Goldfinger"", and Mike has to play four roles in this film...quite a bit of work...maybe he got in over his head trying to balance Austin, Dr Evil, Fat Bastard, and Goldmember. I have to say that Goldmember has some habits that really grossed me out, and he is one character that I am not especially fond of, though he is funny more often than not. And then there are some twists...Mini-Me defects to MOD, Mike Caine comes aboard as Austin's father, Scott loses his hair...sometimes I think the film wants to take itself seriously...and it is not the kind of film that should take itself seriously. The utter reckless abandon was not there, and the comedy seemed to be a bit more forced and more contrived than before. And, of course, Myers seems to have run out of steam at certain points. I can watch the first two films over and over...they are incredibly funny...but Goldmember, I have watched only once or twice. It doesn't do for me what the first two films do. But it does have funny moments, and I would recommend it, though not as highly as the first two.",Austin Powers in Goldmember

While the other characters were off being stupid i was either looking at her or looking at my watch. I am tired of comedy being about gross-out tactics than cleverness. A waste of film and time. 2/10,Austin Powers in Goldmember
148,mjplysaght,Joke's over - pity Myers never figured it out,1,9 June 2017,"So I enjoyed the first two Austin Powers films. The satire and ridiculousness of them really set the tone.However, this film takes a major step back, recycling the same jokes from the previous films and going overboard. They bring in Michael Caine as Austin's father, who I feel is completely wasted in the role. He is so much better than this. They also bring in Beyoncé as the token female companion as well as a tonne of A-listers in brief cameos. I tell ya, the pay must have been good.I rewatched this film again recently. I didn't laugh once. Myers' technique of trying to overplay his already established jokes while hamming it up to 11 really backfires here and it kinda made me cringe, to be perfectly honest. Also Myers takes the role of ANOTHER supporting character bringing his character roster in this series up to four. Goldmember, a Dutch crook with the love of gold, is possibly one of the most unnecessary characters in the film, which is ironic because the film is named after him. It just gives Myers an excuse to have a go at a pathetic Dutch accent.There was really no point for this film to be made, apart from Myers to expand his ego. The humour really wears thin and you kinda wish the film would end sooner, which is never a good sign. They did the parody well in the first two films but this film is a clear indication that they should have just left it at two.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
149,giancarlorocks,A dismal third attempt at recreating a shagadelic atmosphere...,8,25 July 2002,"The best joke in the latest Austin Powers Film comes at the very end when our perrenial villain, Fat Bastard, compares his new look to a women's organ.The third and seemingly last of the Austin Powers films (we will get to that later); Austin Powers in Goldmember, is a disappointing finale if the trilogy does come to an end. This movie is susceptible to what I like to call, 'bowtie endings' in which all the characters are happy, everything falls into place and the masses are pleased with no clear cut solution. Pity, just when I thought the film would bring closure to a great little idea, it falters at a tremendous rate. This being said, please allow me the admittance of describing the feeling for such harsh opening remarks for the third installment of a once venerable franchise. The first Austin Powers film was a little gem. That film literally came out of nowhere and gained its' following  on video cassette after a paltry box office. Upon the sequel, the same feel and excitement was elevated after the creative team knew they had to come up something fresh,  and they did. For those who follow the films, the tone was set in the second film after a great opening sequence displayed the many abuses the male genitalia can undergo. In the third installment, all the energy runs dry after a hilarious cameo packed action sequence sets the running gag for the 'film within a film' concept. Once we are pleasantly surprised by whom Mike Myers and the rest of the team can assemble for cameo appearances, we are thwarted into vintage Austin Powers territory as the musical introductory sequence occurs. Unfortunately, not all the cameos in the world could save a deplorable and uncreative musical sequence that sets the tone for a heavily choreographed, mildly funny film that solemnly brings closure to the franchise.Mike Myers returns as the heroic Austin Powers, he also returns as the villainous Dr. Evil and the evil henchman Fat Bastard. Amidst all the characters, the creators have decided to throw in another character who is supposed to be from Holland, yet has a freakishly accent reminiscent of New Jersey. The aptly named Goldmember has an affinity for all things gold, and he is supposed to be the driving force behind the evil schemes, yet his character is completetly futile in terms of plot development and those who saw the film, know there isn't even any closure to this character. The question arises - Will there be another Austin Powers film? If it is as recycled as this film was, many will take a pass at it. Some may be asking by this point, why so harsh? It is very simple. Avid fans who have come to know and love the immortal Austin Powers character know the man behind the character; Mike Myers, is a very talented and creative man. Insiders have always claimed many of the intuitive ideas were spawned from Myers and his thorough involvement within the script contributed to the success of the two films. Alas, this cannot be said for the third  As aforementioned, from the musical introductory sequence, a morbid feeling came rushing over me as if to say, 'have they already used up all their ideas?'. Yes they have. Director Jay Roach (Meet the Parents, Austin Powers) returns to helm the third installment in what proves to be a disappointing foray into comedy. Roach tries his best at simply running the camera as many of the skits seem to be strictly improvised grounded in about a couple of sentences of script. The key word is skit. This film lacks cohesiveness due to a complete omission of plot. The film mentions something about kidnapping Austin Powers' father (Sir Micheal Caine) and having Goldmember destroy the world. The gags have all been done before and this time, the audience is laughing at recycled elements from the first two films thrown into a pot. This film is like a best of gag reel and amalgamates all the best elements of the first two films and brings them together. It is simply a running skit of gags that in terms of story, do not contribute to one another. Remember the shadow scene from the second film, it is here. Remember the rivalry between Dr. Evil and his son Scott, it is here too. Remember the sequence where they get around saying a graphic word by alluding to it by spotting things in the sky (a la 'Hot Dog' skit in the second film), it is here also.Spunk and creativity are lacking as the film takes on an uncomfortable tone of dismal classiness. The first two were funny, raunchy and wholesome films. This film will guarantee you many laughs, but when the film is over, one will be asking themselves what they were laughing about. It is that exact mindlessness that works against the film. So many times there were scenes that did not elicit  laughs from the audience, yet they were still included in the final cut.  A lot of little 'bits' in the film did not work, it seemed like a bad high school variety show at some points, but they were still in the film. It is inexplicable when there are uncomfortable pauses within in a comedy, something is incorrect. Adding to the demise of the film is Beyonce Knowles. A singer who makes her acting debut as Foxxy Cleopatra. A Hybrid of Shaft and Jackie Brown all rolled into one. Her character is endlessly annoying and is simply present to prompt awareness about Austin's biracial preferences. In any event, the film will elicit many laughs merely due to the immaturity of the jokes and the recycled cliches brought together. Will it leave the viewer with a dire need to watch it again as in the first two films, sadly no. This time, Austin is not shagadelic.Giancarlo's Rating: **",Austin Powers in Goldmember
150,emfern13,Worst of the Trilogy,7,22 August 2002,"Well Goldmember was not what I expected. It was funny at times but most of the time it was just studid, gross, and unfunny. All the characters are back except for the beautiful Felicity Shagwell. Austin Powers is pretty funny. Dr. Evil is pretty funny but he also gets pretty old. No. 2 and Frau dont have a big part. Scott Evil was not funny. There was too much of Mini Me, he got old too. Fat Bastard was hilarious. The funniest character in the whole movie. There were three new characters in the movie. Austins Dad played by Michael Caine who was pretty much a waste of time. Foxxy Cleopatra who was played by Beyonce Knowles was pretty hot. THe new character play by Mike Myers is Goldmember. Goldmember is disgusting and insulting. He is the worst character of the austin powers movies. Overall, Goldmember is ok but doesn't compare to the other two.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
151,boondocksaint20,Majorly Disapointing,3,29 December 2002,"Okay, the first movie, when I saw it was not that good, but over the years, it has become like a fine wine, in that it somehow, miraculously becomes funnier upon every viewing.  The second one, in my opinion, was the crown jewel in the series.  I saw that one on opening night and it brought the house down.  Rarely have I ever laughed so hard at a movie.  I can't explain why, but the second AP movie is extremely funny, and almost is worthy of the title of comedic genius.  This entry, however, was a huge dispointment for many reasons.I, like many others on this site, got this as a Christmas present.  I was really excited to see it since I missed it in theaters and I loved the second one so much.  The simple truth is that this movie really isn't that funny.  The opening is hilarious with all of the cameos, but then, it just goes downhill.  There are a few scenes, however, that ARE laugh out loud hilarious, but they are few and far between, especially not what we would expect from an AP movie.  These scenes, too, are mostly borrowed and expanded upon from other 'sight' gags from the first two, which were extremely funny.  They're funny this time around, and are appropriately paid homage to, yet, when elaborations on existing jokes from previous sequels are the best part of a sequel, then something is terribly wrong.  There is no plot in this one, though the other two had razor thin plots, at least they were coherent.  This one, to me, made no sense.  It seemed like too many scenes were tacked together or not well thought out.  And the Goldmember character...totally not funny.  I know, it was a shocker to me too, since Dr. Evil, and yes, even Fat Bastard, to me, were both incredibly hilarious.  What was supposed to be funny about him?  The fact that he speaks crappy English?  The fact that he eats his own skin?  The fact that people keep making 'Stupid Dutchman' remarks?  The fact that the filmmakers thought we, the audience are too stupid and braindead to realize the difference between an inteligently played and scripted animated character, and a pathetic excuse for one?  I think the latter of the four questions holds the most merit.  And making Dr. Evil and Austin brothers? Congratulations!   You've officially ruined the franchise!  Yes, all of the old jokes and the times where Mini-Me gets the stuffing beating out of him weren't enough for them to ruin a good franchise, b\c now, they totally ruined the rivalry between Austin and argulably one of the funniest villans in movie history.  Hopefully, they will read reviews like the ones on this site and NOT PURSUE an AP 4.  I'm sorry, but Seth Green is not much of an actor and just can't compare with being the bad guy like Dr. Evil can.Overall, a below average movie.  Why do I say this?  Comedies are supposed to be funny.  This is one of those movies that the producers knew that people would flock in droves to see just b\c of the title rather than the content.  And they succeeded, since this movie made a boat-load full of cash.  This series has run its course and has officially kicked the bucket. What amazes me is that word of mouth (usually reliable with movies) did not prevent millions upon millions of devoted fans and moviegoers alike to be treated to 95 minutes of bordom and pure disapointment.  I rarely say this, but anyone who gives this movie better than average praise truly has no taste in movies.  Trust me, there are silly AND intelligent movies out there (Naked Gun, Airplane, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Blazing Saddles to name a few).  This movie, save for a totally wasted Michael Caine, is totally recycled from the previous two movies.  No originality at all.  At least the first two had a sense of class to them.  I am so shocked to see that this one has a 6.5 rating on IMDB!  Maybe there truly is no hope left for Hollywood being able to dish out good movies anymore.  For those of you who don't believe me, go ahead, I invite you to see for yourself who lame this one is, but if you do, make sure you rent it first and not buy it. If you made the same mistake as the person who got it for me did, you would be inadvertantly rewarding stupid and lethargic filmmakers who I know can do much better.  Shame on you, Mike Myers!  You have so much talent, and this is the best you can do?  Well, maybe the last laugh is on me, since I know this one made mad cash at the box office, but if we as a society keep rewarding mediocrity, then that is what we will always receive.  To be fair, I was thinking about giving it a 4/10 since it did make me laugh really hard about three times, but that rating is truly pushing it mainly b\c of the added disgust at knowing that I've been had and knowing that the filmmakers were capable, and compared to the previous two films, in a way, obligated to make a much better film.  Overall, a complete waste of time.  3/10 stars. That is my story and I'm sticking to it.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
152,Cephyran,funny but weaker...,7,13 September 2004,"Austin Powers is funny. Kind of silly funny, like almost every character associated with Mike Myers. and, as much as I enjoyed Goldmember, I felt is was likely the weakest of the trilogy. Myers returns as the swinging sixties sexy superspy, and this time he finds that Dr Evil and a villain named Goldmember are in cahoots to, once again, try and hold the world ransom, lest terrible things happen. Teamed up with Beyonce Knowles as the sexy agent Foxy Cleopatra and the cinema superstar Michael Caine as his father, Austin has to defeat Dr Evil and Goldmember. So, the humor came rolling a mile a minute. Problem is, some of the stuff is only funny the first time you see it, and then you have to wait a really long time to forget about it before watching it again. And that's partly the problem - a lot of Myer's humor is repetitive, and more often than not vulgar (although it's guaranteed to get laugh from the 13 year old boys demographic). And some of the characters were excessive to the already packed runtime. For example, Fat Bastard, the portly Scottish lackey, didn't even need to be in this movie - he didn't exactly contribute much to the plot. To a lesser extent, there was less focus on Dr Evil than on Goldmember - you'd expect this, because of the title, but it just seems to grind away at the movie. Overall, I have to say it's not the best Austin Powers film, but it's funny when it needs to be. It's what I'd call a really good time-waster.",Austin Powers in Goldmember

But Evil escapes with his precious Mini-me, and thats' not the only threat to Powers, as Scott Evil has suddenly decided to go insane...Funny, intelligent, and it knows it!

The humour is the same but where it came in a steady stream in the first two films it trickles in this one. The cameos in the opening credits are the high point and then it's slowly down hill as the film is not a story but a series of setups for gags that are a little too repetitive.

I just didn't really care for the Goldmember character, himself.  It wasn't that Meyers didn't do a good job... hell no. Its just that I didn't really laugh that much when he was on screen.HOWEVER, the old characters from ""the I.M.O.M."" and ""the S.W.S.M"" MORE than made for the mildly humorous Goldmember character.  Dr. Evil was even funnier; and I didn't think that was possible.  Scott E. was cool and, of course, who could forget Mini Me's performance.

159,james362001,Disappointed! Never Parody Yourself or Character during success.,6,21 August 2002,"Disappointed!  I am an Austin Powers fan and I eagerly awaited for this third film.  But this installment was really bad.  The Dr. Evil bantering was really overdone.  It was as if Mike Myers went on and on with his characters uncontrolablly.  Overdone dialogue trying to make a scene funnier doesn't always work.  I found very little to laugh at this time.  The parody of Tom Cruise (yuck) as Austin Powers with Gwyneth Paltrow and Danny DeVito was not funny to me.  Hollywood Rule #1: Never parody yourself or character that is doing successfully well.  You could  hurt your career.  This is what Mike Myers did this time.  He should have stayed with the 1960's formula that made Austin Powers understandable and funny.  I didn't care for turning Austin Powers into Hollywood-esque.  The rap music scene was unnecessary, dull and boring.  The Daddy Wasn't There song was terrible too.  Of the many ways a Goldmember character could have been created, this Mike Myers image of ""Goldmember"" was disgusting.  Goldmemeber wasn't funny to me but disturbing to watch.  A case in point.  Mike Myers chose actors we don't like to see, i.e., Tom Cruise, Gwyneth Paltrow, Danny DeVito, Britney Spears and John Travolta.  The first two films Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery (1997) and Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999) were really fun to watch.  Thank you for bringing back Verne Troyer, Mindy Sterling and Robert Wagner.  Fred Savage was a good addition.  I recall Mike Myers mentioning this was meant to be his last Austin Powers film, however he said to a reporter at the films' premiere that since hearing everyone had fun perhaps he would do a fourth film.  If a fourth film is made, they might want to try these guidelines: 1. Bring back Verne Troyer, Robert Wagner and Mindy Sterling always. 2. Do not use the word ""circumcise"" in a song or joke. 3. Bring back Elizabeth Hurley. 4. The implied nudity and genital sketches work. 5. The 1960's format works. 6. Stay away from the black ghetto stuff.

The crazy Dutchman, Goldmember, is so weird and crazy you will want to see more and more of him.Of course, all the old regulars return: Austin Powers, Dr. Evil, Fat Bastard, Scott Evil, Frau Farbisinna, and Mini Me. Again, Dr. Evil and Fat Bastard are absolutely hilarious. Unfortunately, Mini Me is not up to par in this film. Making up for him, however, is Nigel Powers played by Michael Caine. Caine's scenes with Verne Troyer actually make Mini Me respectable in the film.Beyonce turns in a decent performance as Foxy Cleopatra, and again, brings us a super hot Powers Girl.

I will list a few pleasant SPOILER surprises in a moment.Too many self-aware jokes for my bag baby.  How many of those can we do before it gets tired? Self aware jokes are simply inserted when there are holes in the script.  One or two is effective. But 5 or more and it becomes a bit insulting...*SPOILERS*Highlights for me included DANNY DEVITO (perfect!!) and Mini-Me crossing over....loved it. Didn't see it coming!Enjoyed Dr. Evil in prison and I even enjoyed Fat Bastard's sumo wrestling.
At times, the movie felt so busy though, that I actually wandered off mentally. Too many bells and whistles going off...exhausting.Although, I liked that Dr. Evil and Austin Powers had relative peace at the end and that Scott Evil looks to take over the evil throne,  I sure hope Dr. Evil won't let Scott hanging to carry the lair all by himself.

In fact, it's more fun than the previous two Powers' films in some respects, and has a noticeably faster and tighter pace. I have no problem with Powers repeating the same gimmicky formula. the original Bond films did the same thing. The only criticism is that the Goldmember villain is not terribly amusing or entertaining. The film misses the mark here. Also, in keeping with Bond parodies and icons, the producers passed up a deliciously wicked opportunity to have Austin or Dr. Evil cover some buxom young girl in gold paint.

164,ntvnyr30,Embarrassingly Unfunny,1,13 January 2008,"This film ranks up there (or is it down there) with some of the worst films I have ever seen. This undistinguished list includes this film, ""Black Sheep"", ""Superman III"", ""Q & A"", and on and on...Unlike the previous two AP films, I did not laugh out loud once. I loved the Jerry Springer bit in the 2nd film, as well as the ""Alan Parsons Project"" as well as the interplay between Dr. Evil and Scott and other bits too.This one was completely awful. I sat there wanting and expecting to laugh and it never came. I wouldn't doubt if another film was released only not to have this piece of rubbish as the epitaph.But the best observation I can make is that there is no direct relation to how much money a film makes (or for TV shows, how high the ratings)and the quality of the film. Case in point: this film made much more than the first two, and yet it blew. Also, consider the fact that the best Star Wars film (which almost no one contests) was ""The Empire Strikes Back"". This film made the least money of all the Star Wars films. A TV example is ""The Simpsons"". The show is almost unwatchable now---just a collection of gags and every one of the family acts like an idiot. Contrast this to the first few seasons, where Marge and Lisa were the sane ones in the family, and the shows actually had a believable underlying plot. Now it's total chaos on the show, and yet it still gets ratings. I think that the general public is behind the power curve, because I'm not certain what they're laughing at--maybe the history of the show. I think it's the same with David Letterman--he used to be much, much funnier when he was on NBC. He was irreverent, and now he's a left-wing Ed Sullivan. The audience laughs at jokes that are just not funny. Again, it's the expectation and the fact that people are behind the power curve.

This chapter opens brilliantly with the most dazzling group of cameos ever (given what follows history will no doubt respond with an eternal shrug of ""what were they thinking?"").  It is soon all revealed to be the pre-credit scene of an Austin Powers biopic...directed by Spielberg (who really should have insisted on reading this script since he ends up looking more idiotic than Britney Spears hitting on Mini Me).  Once the real flick starts (after a rather mechanical and lifeless studio back lot dance number) it becomes instantly evident that Myers and company have nothing new to say about the characters or concept. Even the few attempts at stretching (such as a Harry Potterish flashback to Austin and Evil at school) fall flat.  Two new characters (a bored stiff Michael Caine and a wretched racist grossout fest from Myers in the title role...an idiotic attempt to top the ""Bastard"") are big mistakes...and an even bigger one would be chapter four (no matter how huge the gross on this one).

166,ColeSear,Keeps me wanting more (MANY SPOILERS!!!!!),10,2 August 2002,"When critics slam a comedy and on top of that a SEQUEL of being derivative and regurgitated it makes me wanna hurl, to quote Mike Myers's other alter ego Wayne Campbell.First, of all this Austin movie got back to basics in certain ways in that one of the characters actually dies so we do actually think Dr. Evil lives up to his name. Beyonce Knowles was also actually a breath of fresh air because she wasn't over-involved and unfunny like Heather Graham her character had her place and didn't try to be too funny. Most of 'Felicity Shagwell's' problems were that she was like a female Austin and that really wasn't funny.Now, to the derivative factor....riiight, First, of all they acknowledged how derivative some of the humor is both with the very funny Ozzy Osbourne cameo and then they made the joke ANYWAY by cutting back to back to Johnson, the radar guy. Then there's also Scott getting annoyed at another 'Zip it' session and he refuses to talk, which is slightly different. Goldmember just proves Mike Myers is having fun with his own material and isn't afraid to twist the tail of a cliche or re-hash one of his old jokes in a new situation. Not to mention that these movies started by poking fun at 60s Spy film, James Bond in particular which, are pathetically redundant and too stupid to notice it in the first place. A lot of the funniest things that have happened in these films are jokes I KNEW were coming but were funny anyway like, The Lucky Charms jokes in the first or  'You shut up you bastard...who is fat."" and in this one of course Mr. RobotoMy greatest fear was that there were too many people in this movie but it ended up being groundless. All of the characters were around just enough for us to get what we needed of them ala Frau's 'Yah's'. There's also alot that's new and hysterical in this film. The title character Goldmember like many of the new characters isn't there as often but it quite hysterical. When Dr. Evil couldn't understand what he was he was saying about Austin's ""Fajerr"" I was laughing so much I couldn't breathe. These characters also changed I think people have to look beyond the punchlines and see how these characters are acting. Mini-Me switched allegiances from Dr. Evil to Austin, Dr. Evil bonded with Scott and then through the hilarious ""Harry Potter"" style flashbacks the paternity question is answered and there's all kinds of changes at the end. And of course there's Scott at the end...Fat Bastard's scenes are great! (""Too bad my neck looks like a ..."" well, you know if you saw it) And the fact that Austin Powers spoofed itself with the movie with in a movie is great. Spielberg doing the cartwheels is probably the best part of the movie? Or was it Tom Cruise saying 'Yeah, baby'? All in all this is just as funny as the first two if not more so. Another thing people need to realize is that the catch phrases aren't born overnight. It's repeated viewing that got me saying 'Mooovie' and ""Riiight' the creators realize these little niche jokes have grown and, thus, Dr. Evil's ""S@#&!"" is back!Yes, too many movies are unoriginal and derivative.Yes, there are too many sequels.No matter what though the Austin Powers movies always seem to find new territory to cover and for all of you complainers if and when there is a fourth film it looks like it will be quite different than the first three doesn't it. Basically, I guess many people think you can get enough of a good thing, while that's true that doesn't keep me from wanting more.",Austin Powers in Goldmember

This is the hardest I have ever laughed at a movie since Austin Powers 2: The Spy Who Shagged Me. Great new jokes and humor, hilarious original and new characters, and great new parodies! Austin Powers in Goldmember is very shagadelic baby!",Austin Powers in Goldmember
168,world_of_weird,"Please God, don't let a director's cut sully the planet!",1,31 October 2005,"I've just read in the trivia section that Jay Roach's original cut of this stinkbomb ran for three hours. Now, if there is a God, and I'm hoping there is, surely there can be no better way for Him to show his infinite love for all creation by not allowing this thing to ever see the light of day. Even in its current form, GOLDMEMBER is about ninety minutes too long. It must rate as one of the very worst movies I've ever seen, and believe me, I've sat through a lot of crap in my time, mostly for the pleasure of trashing the worst of the worst on the IMDb. But tearing into GOLDMEMBER would be like kicking a sick puppy...just too easy. Where to begin? The terrible performances, the retarded sense of humour, the self-congratulatory back-slapping showbusiness cameos, the enormous ego and miniscule talent of Mike Myers, or the fact that Jay Roach's approach to direction and editing makes Michael Winner look positively restrained by comparison? This is ninety-something minutes of my life I'll never get back.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
169,MinorityReporter,A little tired - but still fun,6,26 September 2005,"With the third installment in the Austin Powers series Mike Myers finally seems to have lost some steam. His performance isn't as fresh as in either of the previous movies and he tries to cover up for the loss of freshness with even more ludicrous gags than in either of the two previous films combined and it works, to an extent.It is a safe assumption that Goldmember is the most far out, weird film of the series. Lines like: ""I open-mouth kissed a horse once"" firmly establishes that. Myers always did have a crazy sense of humor which he established in the first film and refined in the second film but in the third film he completely goes overboard. The first two films were clearly Bond spoofs and while the third film maintains many Bond spoofs it also references films like Silence of the Lambs but the film does the same mistake as the latest Bond film (Die Another Day). It starts to spoof itself. Many of the jokes are almost complete replicas of the previous Austin Powers film. Fat Bastard returns only to produce the same kind of toilet humor he did in the second film and there is a ""we're casting shadows"" scene once again and while this is pretty funny the first time you see it it pretty quickly loses its appeal. Myers still continues in his Peter Sellers inspired way to add more and more characters that he plays himself and the new character, Goldmember, is by far, the weirdest yet. He is a Dutch criminal mastermind who eats his own skin flakes and has a preposterous accent. The new love interest for Austin is the weakest yet. Beyoncé Knowles is hot and she really can sing but quite frankly isn't much of an actress. The director, Jay Roach, could definitely have done better with the casting there. All of the supporting cast returns again and do exactly what they did in the previous films. No news there except for Verne Troyer (Mini-Me) who is still absolutely hilarious. Also it was nice to see that Michael Caine can be genuinely funny and shallow as well as deep and personal. There are a lot of cameos in the film which produces some of the best laughs. Cameos like: Tom Cruise, Steven Spielberg, Kevin Spacey and Britney Spears.The effects are pretty impressive for a comedy but they don't really do much. They are just there to look nice and were probably expendable when you think about it. Still its nice to know that Hollywood are willing to spend a considerable amount on money on comedies as well as big action movies and as the effects don't lessen the value of the movie it really doesn't make much of a difference.The film is still pretty funny and I enjoyed it even though it felt a bit tired. Some if the re-used ideas worked well and I did laugh uncontrollably in one scene but overall the film is inferior to its predecessors but definitely worth a look.6/10",Austin Powers in Goldmember
170,nxgn_not_not,Several remarkable scenes,5,2 August 2002,"Not as satisfying as I had hope from some one of M. Myers talent.  That being said there is some great work here.  Beyonce exudes sensuality when she needs to and rolls with the rough spots without ever taking you out of the movie.  Verne Troyer has really come into his own as the much-abused henchman.  Robert Wagner - Fred Savage - Michael York, what can you say, they do as much as they can with the part they are given.  But one can never forget Goldmember is basically a showcase for the Talents of one M. Myers. And he is a remarkable individual.  Playing 4 roles the comparisons to Peter Sellers are obvious, but one must wonder (76million earned so far aside) what would Peter Sellers have been capable of if he had had M. Myers freedom?  What would M. Myers have done if he were forced to deal with what Peter Sellers was allowed to, and not allowed to do? 	 Well worth seeing on the big screen.",Austin Powers in Goldmember

Other than that, this was a very funny movie and I thought much funnier than the first two.  Now that the lines and gags like ""Yeah Baby"" and ""Behave"" are well established, the first two movies don't hold up.  Myers had to come up with something fresh for this one, and he did.  The man is a comic genius and continues to impress, but I agree that he should retire the series.Also, what's wrong with Michael Caine being in this movie?  This is better than Jaws 4.  If I were Michael Caine (with my position already established in film history) why not have a little fun?  That's what DeNiro is doing. What would you rather be, austere and respected or approachable and respected?  There is nothing wrong with not taking yourself too seriously. I enjoy it when serious actors do things like this.  Take Christopher Walken in that Fatboy Slim video.  hilarious.  7/10 for Goldmember.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
172,Jack_Yan,Toit like a toiger!,7,25 December 2005,"I was so disappointed with The Spy Who Shagged Me, this film's prequel, that I did not see Goldmember till it played on network television. And I'm regretting I didn't pay to see it uninterrupted at the time, back in 2002.This is an Austin Powers movie, not a Dr Evil movie like its predecessor. Austin doesn't look lost, but is back in his element. It doesn't give too much focus on the villains. With Michael Caine as Austin Powers' father, the scenes seem to have more sparkleperhaps knowing they would attract someone of Caine's calibre, everything was that much more polished. Even the toilet humour seems tolerable compared with the previous outing.The sets are more expensive; the jokes are less repetitive; and there are more cameos than before, including those of Tom Cruise and Gwyneth Paltrow in a clever film-within-a-film sequence. While Myers penned this idea in his original script for Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery, it was nice to see it realized here.Beyoncé Knowles is a surprisingly good actress, and at no time does it appear this is her first film role. And rather than be directly inspired by a James Bond film, Myers has charted a more original, and highly entertaining, course. In fact, the Michael Caine references are plentiful: the use of a Mini as a getaway car, a sequence where the stars sing a version of 'What's It All About, Alfie' (edited out, though the song is still heard in the end credits), and even old footage of Caine. The Nigel Powers character's spectacles are a take-off of Caine's Harry Palmer's, from the 1960s. And not a lot of people know that.One disappointment is the lack of screen time for Robert Wagner, and Mr Bigglesworth, the cat, is hardly seen except in a flashback sequence.Goldmember nearly had the sort of impact its predecessors did. Just as fingered ""air quotes"" became commonplace after the first film, many people will have the idea that a Dutch accent is the bad one Myers adopted for his Goldmember persona.The finalé is a surprise, and that's hard for a movie series that has prided itself on self-referential humour and parody. And while it gives a reasonably satisfying conclusion, it leaves open the opportunity of a very different fourth Austin Powers movie.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
173,videofreak2002,"Oh groovy baby! ""Goldmember"" is the funniest of the series!",10,11 August 2002,"""Austin Powers In Goldmember"" was laugh-out-loud from beginning to end. The original characters were back: Austin Powers/Dr. Evil/Fat Bastard (Mike Myers), Number 2 (Robert Wagner), Scott Evil (Seth Green), Frau Farbissina (Mindy Sterling), Johnson (Clint Howard), Basil Exposition (Michael York), and Mini-Me (Verne Troyer).  We got new characters: Foxy Cleopatra (Beyonce Knowles), Number 3/The Mole (Fred Savage), Nigel Powers (Michael Caine), and Goldmember (Myers).  We even got some cameoes: Britney Spears, Steven Spielberg, John Travolta, Gwyneth Paltrow, Tom Cruise, Quincy Jones, Burt Bacharach, The Osbournes, Kevin Spacey, and Danny DeVito.
The movie is still shagadelic.  There were even twin Japanese sisters named Fook Yu and Fook Mi.  My 3 favorite scenes and they're not in particular: 1.  The office scene with Austin Powers and Mini-Me. 2.  The beginning where they're making a AP movie and Cruise plays AP, Paltrow palys Dixie Normous, Spacey plays Dr. Evil, and Danny Devito plays Mini-Me, and the scene when flips the bird at the screen was very funny. Even Spielberg was directing it. 3.  Whenever The Mole shows up every time on the screen. (mole)From what I heard, the movie was originally 3 hours long and they cut out half of it, including: one with Mustafa (Will Farell), the younger Number 2 (Rob Lowe), and the first two AP babes: Vanessa Kensington (Elizabeth Hurley) and Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham). (mooooooolllllleeee)Oh, well.  That's why we have DVD and I hope they put the deleted footage in the DVD.  But, if you enjoyed the first 2 AP movies, then you'll enjoy ""Austin Powers In Goldmember.""  Yeah, baby, yeah!! (moley moley moley moley moley)

In 1999, the sequel, ""Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,"" made more money opening weekend then the original at the B.O. and grossed over $200 million, making Austin Powers one of the funniest characters ever.  Now, in 2002, ""Austin Powers in Goldmember"" has just been released and the movie is more groovier.

It goes over many peoples head and they see it as dumb and corny and they don't have reality of what the movie is doing.It is corny and dumb but with genius and Mike Meyers is a genius at comedy and in my opinion this movie is the pinnacle of that genius.All of his movies lead up to this, his last great movie. I loved it! This movie is all over the place. From a very good musical in the jail to peeing next to the statue.From the incredibly funny fight scene with MINI ME to the scene with Fuk Mi and Fuk yu.Very very funny!

176,Greensleeves,Multi-Talented Mike!,5,11 August 2003,"I must admit that I came to this film as a complete Austin Powers' novice and I was totally amazed when I discovered how many characters Mike Myers plays in this movie. I could have sworn Dr. Evil was being played by Paul Reubens - I was flabbergasted when I found out otherwise. This is an amazingly surreal movie and the gags are endless but what a pity so many of them are at the level of toilet humour. This guy has so much talent it's a crime to waste it on so many crude and disgusting jokes. Even so, I laughed myself silly at many of the situations especially the medical check-up' scene and the scene where Nathan Lane acts as the third party' in a conversation with Foxxy Cleopatra. The musical score is groovy' (`It's A Hard Luck Life' sequence is hilarious), the costume design sensational and Foxxy Cleopatra is divine perfection - hey, that wasn't Mike Myers as well was it?",Austin Powers in Goldmember

178,JohnLennon1985,I LIKE GOOOOOOOOLD....member.,10,12 September 2002,"If I can describe this movie in three words, I would say, ""Shagadelic, baby, yeah!"" Mike Myers, the comedic genius who made the phrases, ""Yeah, baby"" and the word ""Shag"" famous is back again in a movie that is superior to the Spy Who Shagged Me.While the original Austin Powers is better, this movie focuses on intellectual jokes. Many of the people I know who didn't like it, knowing them, it was probably because they didn't understand it. There were a few references to movies even outside the James Bond series. I even remember one instance where Dr. Evil was speaking as though he were Hannibal Lecter in an obvious Silence of the Lambs reference.Beyoncé Knowles has proven to be a worthy actress. I don't see what the problem is with singers doing some acting, because singing is a form of acting... But I digress. Beyoncé had a couple of punchlines, much like Hurley and Graham, but once again, Austin's babe is just there for Austin's (or in this case Mini-me's) sex jokes.Goldmember was one of Myers' most creative villains. As simple as lines like ""I LIKE GOOOOOLD"" and ""I am from Sweden. Isn't that weird?"" sound, the delivery makes Goldmember a one-of-a-kind villain, and I find him to be even better than Fat Bastard.Myers also cleverly planted some special appearances in that movie, and when he does, they do draw laughs.I will not compliment the end of this movie. While it was an unexpected plot twist, Goldmember could have done better without the scene they closed the movie with, especially since this is supposed to be the last movie of the series.If you watch one movie this year, watch Star Wars. If you watch two, watch the Godfather... but if you watch three, watch Braveheart... Ah, hell. We all see more than 3 movies a year. Just fit Goldmember in there somewhere!",Austin Powers in Goldmember

Of course not wanting to fall short of the others, this Austin Powers gives us the same great humor with a different twist; we are now in the 70's as opposed to the 60's.If you haven't seen the other two films then you will probably not be able to appreciate this film, as many of the jokes and humor is pulled over from the other two films.  Again more characters are added, many of them acted by Myers.  It is fun watching Myers play the four or five different characters in the film, and one cannot help but to admire the talent.This movie offers a great beginning and the first five minutes alone are a non-stop riot and worth the price of admission.For upholding the reputation of others, this film rates a 7/10.",Austin Powers in Goldmember

Austin (once again) must stop him with the help of the beautiful Foxxy Cleopatra and his father, played by Michael Caine in a useless performance.Does this sound familiar? This is the same story I've seen in the first two movies and when you consider that everyone seems to be in on this fact combined with their phoned in performances, you see how unnecessary this sequel really is.What can you say about this: It's not funny, it's limp, the cameos are useless with a few exceptions, and the story often makes no sense.

Not that this is a bad movie, indeed it is about as good as the second Austin Powers film, 'The Spy Who Shagged Me', but the signs of strain are there.'Goldenmember' has Austin trying to foil Dr Evil's latest evil scheme for global conquest/destruction by traveling back in time to 1975, where he hooks up with his old flame Foxy Cleopatra and tries to rescue his dad Nigel Powers (played by Michael Caine, which is a nice nod to his spy roles of earlier years) from the clutches of Goldenmember, a swinging villain with a fetish for gold and his own skin. Meanwhile, Scott Evil and Mini Me are having trouble relating to their own father, Dr Evil.The opening scenes before the titles of 'Goldenmember' are hilarious - describing them would give away what make them so good. But after that there are only a few very funny moments scattered throughout the movie. For instance Goldenmember's introduction - meet a leg-bending, rollerscating, hip Dutch wierdo doing a dance number - is great, but after that he becomes rather dull as the personalities of the other characters seem to overwhelm him. Likewise Foxy Cleopatra could have been a lot more interesting than she is - a babe with an afro and a bit of attitude who laughs at Austin's lame jokes. Mike Myers also often overplays those jokes. There's only so many times you can laugh at a giant mole or a funny accent, and that's not many times. I don't know why he wanted to stretch his material out so often, as the movie does feel overlong. I would have also liked to see something a bit wittier thrown in now and then, as it's nice to laugh at something clever jokes as well as something silly.For all that 'Goldenmember' is a pretty funny movie and fans of the first two films will like it.

I mean, Mike Myers is a funny guy, but this constant rehash of old material (see the radar jokes, the shadow-on-the-wall, the father-son misunderstandings) is just a bit worrying and suggests Mr. Myers has run out of ideas.There are some classic moments in the movie, like the beginning sequence, and the shadow-on-the-wall sequence involving Mini-me, but the whole thing stinks of self-indulgence and money-making rather than originality or passion.I felt myself, straining to laugh throughout the 90 minutes or so I was in the cinema, and I SO wanted to love this movie as I loved the previous two installments. Mike Myers is funny, and Beyonce Knowles is surprisingly good too, but Michael Caine isn't given the right material to shine and the Osbournes cameo verges on the pointless.Good, but not your best effort.

The real problem with a ""comedy"" like this is that the humour has no value, it just isn't funny. Mike Myers style is offbeat and random, which works when it has a good basis as it did with the James Bond nods in previous incarnations. The basis for this was low grade Howard Stern toilet jokes, one after another, nothing else. His ""Goldmember"" character was just.....odd. Not funny, not even interesting, just bewildering. I really believe the target audience for this one is composed solely of uncultured morons. It's really a shame because the first two Austin Powers flicks had a least some intellectual credibility to them. Myers has proved before that he can take something silly and obscure and make it appealing. This has no appeal. None.

This film is the first in a long time that reminds me of the keystone cops, laurel and hardy or charlie chaplin. The funny is funny and the film lacks pretension or an absorption with plot details that encumber humor.

The ""Yeah, baby"" catchphrase was old and there's only so much of one actor playing a bunch of unfunny one liner characters you can watch. It seems these days if you want to see a comedian trying to hard to be funny then look for a fat suit or other outrageous costume and multiple roles in one film.

Does Mike Myers have no limit to his creativity?In this movie we are introduced to several new characters, including Goldmember, Foxxy Cleopatra and Austin's father Nigel Powers which Myers wanted to be played by Sean Connery, if I'm not mistaken. We also get more of the old characters (Fat Bastard, Mini-Me, Scott Evil, etc) and lots of cameos like Tom Cruise, Steven Spielberg and Britney Spears.This third Austin Powers film makes use of all the jokes that made the other two a hit, but with a twist. There's even an inside joke about it, starring Ozzy Osbourne. I don't mind this, as long as they come up with entirely new and funnier jokes, as they did.What's next for Mike Myers after Austin Powers (if this were the last movie)?

Britney Spears's cameo however was just shameless and I'm glad her head exploded a short time after she appears. Midway through the first half you can't wait for it to be over. Yes, there were a few good jokes, but the movie as a whole felt so much more crude than the original two that I actually cringed in parts. Mini-me though does steal the show completely, although I do feel a tinge of guilt for laughing at a midget getting beaten up every two seconds. Michael Caine also proves he's past his acting prime and I'm honestly surprised he picked such a terrible part to play.Anyway, I'll stop right there. Don't go in expecting anything near as 'good' as the first two. This is pure, unadulterated and crude Hollywood.",Austin Powers in Goldmember

So i went to see it when it hit theaters. When the movie was over i stood up and the first thing i thought was, ""thats 2 hours of my life i'll never get back"". This movie was horrible. I can't believe anyone actually liked it. The jokes were gross and stupid. And whats up with all the cameo appearences? I thought that was really gay, and just the whole plot of the movie was stupid. Mike Meyers isn't a good actor by any means, but he did good in Austin Powers 1 and 2. I hope that Meyers doesn't do another one, i know he's talked about it. But geez this was so bad, i can't even imagine how crappy a 4th one would be.",Austin Powers in Goldmember

It starts out okay but by the end you feel mildly sick like that was too much, really. The bathroom humor was overdone, and they should have left Fat Bastard in the deep freeze. This was a conglomeration of Dr. No, Goldfinger, and Silence of the Lambs, among others. Low points? The mole joke, Goldmember eating his own skin or fat bastard with too much skin, and father jokes. It is good Myers reincarnated Fat Bastard as Shrek because one sequel in this series was quite enough. In short the movie contained too many shitake mushrooms for any sensible person to take.",Austin Powers in Goldmember

I don't belong to those people who laugh all through the film but there are some funny jokes. I do like some of the naughtiness of the film which is paired with a disarming childish obliviousness to the rules of the world. This episode looks as if it was the last one - and I think it's good to finish this chapter now and turn to other things.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
199,eddy_currents,Disjointed with some very funny scenes,7,25 July 2002,"Some good laughs and some big laughs, and a whole lot of silliness. The movie was mainly a lot of sight gags that didn't flow together well. It was difficult to stay in the movie, because the gags would take over the scenes, and the world around the characters would stop so they could finish their dialogue. And the time travel thing has become commonplace, making me wonder why any of them still existed.A lot of jokes were repeated from the previous films, but there were enough new ones to keep me interested. Most were totally outrageous but still worked, like the opening dance numbers. There were some good parodies too, like the obvious product placements and the rap music video.I enjoyed it. Worth seeing if you like the first two, or if you appreciate parody. It has more sexual content than the first two, and less bathroom humor, which is a good thing. But I think I'm just getting tired of Austin Powers. They should stop here.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
200,KEVMC,A disappointing addition to the series,5,5 October 2002,"Austin Powers travels back to 1975 in an attempt to rescue his father, who has been kidnapped by Dr Evil's new partner in crime, Goldmember.First the plus points. The film looks great. The large budget and excellent production design have been put to good use, giving it a glossy and expensive feel. Some of the performances are also quite pleasing. Michael Caine seems to be enjoying himself playing Austin's superspy father. Beyonce Knowles is surprisingly good as Foxy Cleopatra and Verne Troyer steals every scene he's in as Mini-Me.Now to the minus points. Most of the first half of the film is desperately unfunny. It's so bad that I almost walked out at one point (a couple in front of me did). It struck me that it was similar to watching Peter Sellers in the last 'Pink Panther' film that he made. What was once fresh and joyous was now tired and merely self indulgent. The character of Powers himself is at his most irritating here. Fat Bastard's presence appears to have no point, and the title character Goldmember is underwritten. Also the large number of cameo appearances is becoming a lame gimmick.Things do pick up a little in the last 30 to 40 minutes, and there are some genuinely funny moments, but they are too long coming. Overall this is a disappointing addition to the franchise, and one can only hope that Mike Myers can re-ignite the spark of the previous films, should he choose to do another.",Austin Powers in Goldmember

Mike Meyers is very talented comedic actor. He enjoys his characters and the fun is obviously contagious. I have seen a lot of the summer faire this year-MIBII, Bourne Identity, Minority Report, Blood Work, Signs and others, to be frank it has been less than a banner summer.  The one movie I was really looking forward to deliver a good laugh, was Powers and he did just that. Yes, some of it is really gross, some of it is sophomoric, but damn it is funny.

There were a few funny, original parts, however the rest of the movie was a mere re-hash of the first two, and you cannot carry a movie by sight-gags alone. I really like Mike Meyers as a real talent. Don't do another Austin Powers movie, Mike. You would only be degrading your talent.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
203,driver_8,Check Please!,1,27 July 2004,"I am not an Austin Powers hater. The first two rank as two of the funniest films ever made. Mike Myers is a certified genius. However, this third installment is as bad of film as I have ever seen. It is a bogus sellout from the start. Cameos everywhere, but not one even slightly amusing. Michael Caine is dry. The Beyonce girl plays in a role that does not have one funny part. The Goldmember character is funny. Myers tries in his other three roles, but nothing looks planned out. The film has a rushed look and feel. Half way through I started to wonder if it was just me or was this film as funny as jock itch? I have a great sense of humor and I love silly humor as much as anybody. However, this is not silly comedy, this is poorly written crap in search of a paycheck. The skit has run its course, let it die. Time for Mike Myers to move on, Lord knows he is talented enough to come up with something new.

Some people in the theater was taking a nap and a few others were just disappointed, and commented the film with one word: ""STUPID"".It is SAD to see so many people in the theater actually thinks that the movie is funny. I believe this movie is for those people with IQ less than 70. Even Forrest Gump won't think this movie is funny. Mike's Goldmember is a complete failure, the portrait of a Dutch man was stupid, and seeing people laughing at jokes about genital was really sad.What is culture, lesson, meaning in this movie? I don't see it.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
205,Gareth_Hacking,Underwhelming,3,20 September 2002,"After the blatant product placement in the last film (for example, when Austin arrives back in 1969. ""Hey baby, get off my heinie!"") I expected at the very least a 5-minute ad break in the middle of the film. Not quite that bad though did anyone not notice the Pepsi machine behind Britney during the closing credits, I can't say I enjoyed the film. Sure, it has its moments (the opening 5 minutes, the schooldays flashback) but overall most of the jokes fall flat or bring to mind the words 'flogging' 'a' 'dead' and 'horse' to mind. The Osbournes cameo just showed the filmmakers know this.It was also a shame to see the supporting cast wasted this time around, having barely any screen-time. Rob Lowe's 'appearance' in the film was a 5-second sequence during the end credits that featured him and Robert Wagner sitting next to each other with Wagner dressed in drag pulling off a wig. Can anyone explain what that was about?",Austin Powers in Goldmember
206,thrillhouse678,"Great movie, Beyonce can't act.",9,26 July 2002,"I have a message for anyone who thinks this movie was bad: You are an idiot. (End of message) This movie is hilarious. It has the greatest opening ever with the four greatest cameos ever. Britney Spears is so hot it is inconcievable. Mini Me has a bigger part and he is awesome the whole time. But the movie isn't all good. Beyonce Knowles can't act to save her life. She's really hot and everything but she is God awful. Calling everyone ""Sugar"" at the end of every line is not at all funny. I thought we learned something from Britney Spears in ""Crossroads"", just because you sing dosen't mean you can act. And, in Britney and Beyonce's cases, if you sing badly you act even worse. Fat Bastard has a bigger part than in the second movie, which makes the movie even better. If you don't like Fat Bastard because he's offensive, shut your face. He's funny. They re-use some of the funny jokes from the second movie but this time they're even funnier. So go see this movie because I said it was funny and anyone who disagrees is the kind of moron who ruins good movies for the rest of us.",Austin Powers in Goldmember

And of course, Meyers continues to entertain us with us multiple personalities as he introduces us to Goldmember.  The original characters (Dr. Evil and Fat Bastard) still have us laughing our rear ends off, as well!  The only real fault of this movie...someone needs to kill off Scotty Evil!

210,Headbiscuit,"Worth my $7... once, but never again.",5,29 July 2002,"The third installment of Austin Powers in Goldmember was one that needed a few things for me to like it.  First, I saw it with a bunch of my friends, and second, I saw it with a large theather packed with people.  This way, the crowd was pretty reactive to what went on and people played off each other in enjoying the film.  However, if I had to watch this movie alone, I might have turned it off.Goldmember had its moments for entertaining value, but too much of the humor was either sick and twisted or just a repeat of the other two movies. Even the cameo by Ozzie Osbourne which tried to self-mock the movie couldn't save the fact that there were many recycled gags.  Still, some of them were new and made the theather laugh.Unfortunately, the best part of the movie was the first five minutes as Austin does an elaborate celebrity-filled musical number.  From there it went down.  Primarily with the introduction of the rest of the cast. Beyonce Knowles (Foxxy Cleopatra) was a horribly miscast actress.  Her scenes were stupid, humorless, and heavily reliant on other characters to save the scenes.  Sure - she was absolutely HOT, but it wasn't worth it. There was also very embarrasing cameo by Fred Savage.There were certain scenes in this film that were downright disgusting. I'm not one with a weak-stomach, and some of the dialouge had me nearly nauseated (Fat Bastard describing his... releases, etc).  Not to mention rather gross discussion between Mini-Me and Nigel Powers.  Everything related to Goldmember was gross, especially the skin stuff.A rather odd ending made the movie that much less enjoyable.This Austin Powers was funnier than the second, but worse than the first. All in all, with the whole theather laughing, I would give that experience a 7/10, but the movie a 3/10.  So I rated Goldmember a 5/10.",Austin Powers in Goldmember

Believe it or not, Fat Bastard and Dr. Evil were funnier.  Bottom line for me...it was all the same old gags but with more crudity.  The Goldmember character was just nauseating and not funny at all. The skin peeling was just gross.  I can see the potential humor in a pasty freckly Dutch guy with a golden ""member"" but it just was NOT FUNNY!!!!! The only scene I laughed at was the one where Austin and Mini-Me have to disguise themselves together as one sailor (guess who's on whose shoulders?!) and the rest of that physical exam scene (more shadows, but even funnier than the last film). Now that whole scene was hilarious, but I should have waited for the rental.  Oh sure, there were a few titters here and there (the all-star cameos, and the Sumo wrestlers) but definitely NOT the laughfest I was hoping for.  More of a gross-out fest, sorry to say.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
212,gallenm1,Abysmal,1,8 July 2003,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  The film is often annoying, has very little in the way of truly funny jokes, and is unoriginal.  Many of the jokes have been recycled from the previous Austin Powers movies, something that the film itself acknowledges.  The film brags about its lack of originality!  Beyonce Knowles is unamusing as Cleopatra, and often just stands around watching while Mike Myers mugs.  She is not as effective as Elizabeth Hurley or Heather Graham. The character of Goldmember is ill-conceived and less than amusing.  As my father, who watched it with me, noted, ""The character wasn't even one dimensional; he's half-dimensional."" The only jokes associated with him either fail to bring even a chuckle, or grow old very quickly. Finally, the film is laden with annoying celebrity cameos that distract from the action.  The celebrities in question should fire whoever talked them into appearing in this garbage.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
213,M&J,D+ or C- at best. A let down.,6,28 July 2002,"I liked the first two Austin Power movies a lot and I consider myself a level headed Myers fan. I didn't let all the hype on TV, the net and fast food cups whip me into thinking this film would be anything more than another perfectly mindless yet extremely funny Myers film. I was looking forward to seeing it.However, it pains me to say that I was disappointed with the film. I was really hoping Myers would continue his streak, but this could be the end of Austin Powers.The film starts off with an incredibly funny barrage of surprising cameo's and comedic gems. I liked the bit with him, the Japanese twins and his TO DO list. I also like the MOLE jokes. And there were other bits that occurred so quickly that all I can remember is that I nearly started to cry from laughter. At first, I thought the film would surpass the first two in cleverness and raunchiness.But then, wham! The film gets mired in mindless, non funny filler sketches. In fact, this entire movie is nothing more than a series of sketches. Myers probably wanted this quality in the film to make it plain to the audience that we shouldn't take any of what was going on too seriously. However, this isn't SNL and the film became so disjointed and so unbelievably silly that its silliness became too distracting. There was also too much circular comedy. The previous two movies spoofed spy films and the 60's in general; however this movie spent too much time spoofing itself. These ""inside jokes"" should have been limited to only one or two of the sketches, but instead they became a major part of the entire film, and unfortunately, it wasn't all that funny.Plus, I didn't like all the musical numbers. I'm not a big fan of hip hop or Britney Spears, and neither are a lot of my friends (we're all musicians), so the 30 plus minutes of gangsta rap lifestyle parody's fell flat. I don't think the emphasis on money and bikini clad women that is so prevalent in every hip hop video today is all that funny to begin with. It's sad, actually. I could tell that Myers was trying to satire the hip hop image but it wasn't scathing enough.  The Britney cameo, which came early in the film, seemed so forced and unnatural that I don't think even Myers liked it. But he was probably forced to keep it in the movie by Pepsi, Taco Bell, Britney's agents, and whatever other demons Myers sold his soul too in order to promote the film. As a witty comedic writer, I'm sure Myers was foaming at the mouth to let Britney Spears have it but the worst insult he could lob at her and have stick was to get her head explode in a ball of flame. I caught the real joke in that, I just wish it could have been a little more in your face so that even the Britney fans could realize it.The movie picked up again with some mini-me sketches that occur right before the finally 10 minutes of the film. But by just when I started laughing again, the film became unfunny for a second time. There are some more cameos and Myers revisited some jokes from the previous Austin flick, but the laughs were less than cheap. I couldn't get into it. The credits contained some outtakes that should have been left out. In fact the slow motion Burt Bacorack (sp) outtake actually so unfunny that it killed all of the remaining laughter in the theater. Everyone in the audience was like ""oh well, what was that?'Yeah, all in all, this film was the lamest of the bunch. It just barely gets an average grade. The first two movies were well paced and there was a memorable quote or hilarious sight gag every few minutes. This film is just too lopsided and disjointed. Wait for the DVD and skip the bits that don't make you laugh. The plot is hardly necessary. So watching the DVD in this manner will probably make the film more enjoyable to watch.This movie is D+ funny. 6/10",Austin Powers in Goldmember
214,tjpmkp,A TOTAL RIP-OFF,1,29 July 2002,"This was a terrible movie, completely unfunny.  Normally, comedies that fail at humor do not get me angry, but this one did.  Clearly, Mike Myers has such contempt for his fans that he feels that he can put together garbage and know that he can make millions off it.  Let's not make him rich off such junk -- If you haven't seen it -- DON'T!!P.S.  The so-called ""hilarious"" cameos in the beginning are mildly amusing at best, and the concept was basically ripped off from a similar stunt in ""Pee Wee's Big Adventure"" done well over a decade ago.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
215,AP-Project,Uneven But Often Hilarious,8,31 July 2002,"A trippy, almost surreal vision from Mike Myers that is generally engaging but occasionally misfires.  The plot involves another ransom demand from Dr. Evil, who threatens to use a ""tractor beam"" to pull a large meteor toward Earth. The opening sequence, with several superstar cameos, is amusing and wonderful. The rest of the movie is a series of rapid-fire gags; many of them are of the self-parody variety. Goldmember doesn't have much witty dialogue, but his presence is intended to be an absurd homage, (complete with sick personal habits) to the gold-obsessed Auric Goldfinger character. Similarly, Beyonce Knowles as Foxxy Cleopatra is here primarily to emulate Pam Grier's persona from her sassy ""blaxpoitation"" movies in the 70's.  I found these homages to be clever and well done.  Beyonce is very sexy and delivered her lines very competently for a 20 year old with no acting experience. One of the failures of the movie is Foxxy does not become a romantic interest during the movie, as Vanessa and Felicity did in the earlier 2 movies.  That would have given the movie more soul. The gags are mostly funny, however. The rap by Doctor Evil in prison is terrific.  Seth Green's new gambit for his father's love and respect becomes hilarious and he ends the movie on a petulant, defiant note. Mini-Me's ""conversion"" is also hilarious, especially his new duds as a Powers' convert. However, the fight between Mini-Me and a misconstruing Powers does drag on too long. I'm one of the few who thinks Fat Bastard is funny and I thought he was more funny here than in the last movie. Michael Caine was drolly amusing as Austin's father. I loved Nathan Lane's cameo as a Foxxy liasion.  The least amusing scene was Austin's (over)reaction to the ""Mole"" character.  However, the Mole's scene with Dr. Evil was genuinely funny. All in all, this is a fun movie to watch. I recommend it, especially if you can see it with other fans of Myers' absurdist humor. 8/10",Austin Powers in Goldmember
216,AP-Project,A Mixed Blessing,8,2 August 2002,"It was great to see AP in action again.  The opening was great, but it was very much a mixed bag after that. The rivalry between Scott Evil and Mini-Me is taken to a higher level with unexpected twists, and is really the highlight of the movie.   I loved Dr. Evil's sub design. A star cameo helps to reacquaint Austin with Foxxy in a very funny bit. Beyonce is very sexy and shagadelic.  She has a nice voice, both for speaking and singing.  Her acting is also commendable, as she recreates the Pam Grier persona very accurately. Fat Bastard displays an unexpected talent and is quite funny.Dr. Evil has a very memorable scene with Mini-me. Two new characters are introduced, but they are only marginally funny.  All in all, this is a fun trip for fans of Myers' quirky, absurdist humor.  8/10",Austin Powers in Goldmember
217,VenomX,"Good comedy, weak script, great jokes",7,10 August 2002,"Austin Powers started off as a small James Bond-spoofing title back in 1997. Since then, it has grown into a giant marketing juggernaut that has held a firm grip on summer comedies since it's debut.  The original had a small budget, but excelled in its script, which was filled with visual gags and memorable quotes, as well as the predominant Bond spoofs it contained.  The sequel came out two years later, and received a moderately mixed reception. Some were disappointed with it, as they saw the recycling of old gags and the introduction of more bathroom humour.  I, on the other hand, saw it as a worthy sequel that wasn't as good as the original, but could still hold it's own.  Now, we have another sequel that allows the Austin Powers series to become a trilogy, a large honour in franchises.The plot goes like this: Dr. Evil has hatched a plan where he will recruit the evil villain Goldmember from 1975, he will kidnap Austin Powers' father in the present and hide him in the 70's, meanwhile, he begins a plan to pull a asteroid into Earth with a tractor beam.  Austin must now team up with his former girlfriend Foxxy Cleopatra to save his father and defeat the evil Dr. Evil.Before you see Goldmember, keep in mind that this movie is a lot sillier and crazier than the previous ones.  Unlike the first two, this one tends to keep its plot a little contained and focus completely on its jokes and gags, many of which are hilarious.  Some scenes are recycled again, but have been turned around so they appear more original (like the ""objects that looks suggestive on the radar screen').  The celebrity cameos that were used are really hysterical (I'm not going to spoil anything for you, it's much more funny if you don't expect it) and the spoofing in here was nicely done (a little more subtle this time around).   The jokes are what drive this movie, the plot is meaningless as time goes on, and that's one problem.  In the first two, a decent plot was used to back the movie up, in this one; it's a little absent.  One reason for this is the fact that the editing job is a little poor, so as a result, you really can't tell what is going on sometimes (I had to watch it a second time to understand it).
See this one for the humour, just leave your brain at the door and enjoy, that's wait this movie is aiming for.  Not as good as the original, about on par with the second one.  To be honest, they should end this series now, Goldmember showed a few signs of franchise fatigue as the movie went on, creating a fourth one would just be milking the series.7/10",Austin Powers in Goldmember

For me, LAME is the perfect word to sum up this movie.The next few lines will contain the few spoilers I'm prepared to give: The start of the movie couldn't get any worse, the ""celebrity appearances"", the faces of Austin Powers and Doctor Evil, such as Doctor Evil's changed eye color, not to mention Austin Powers looks like an old pervert that had botox injections(you could argue that it's to add to the comedy but he still looks different from the other movies), rater than a middle-aged secret agent, and ,the fact, that it's weird for a British secret agent to wave American flags, especially since he never did it in the other movies and it's unrelated to spying or comedy(what this movie is suppose to be about).Also, let's not forget the main plot: nothing special, funny, smart, well made or original about it, ""son goes to find his father"".It's unlike the first movies and it wasn't enjoyable, even if I'd pretend the other movies didn't exist.",Austin Powers in Goldmember

They should have had more ""zip it"" or ""shh."" Goldmember was the real villain. Dr. Evil didn't really do anything. I really hope they don't make a 4th.

But Goldmember the charecter wasn't that funny, but luckly Dr.Evil better than ever in this film.

There's still a chuckle to be had with a wonderful cast with Mike Myers reprising his role (well, roles) as Austin Powers and Michael Cain as Austin's father was a good choice. Despite being more in the 70s than the last two even though Austin is clearly a 60's stereotype, it's a good film to pass the time with a couple of laughs.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
226,YanKstaSpaZ,A lot of fun!!,10,29 July 2002,"I thought this was a great finale of the Austin Powers saga...I was in stitches quite often throughout this movie.  This one was a quite a bit different than the others...it focused more on gags, than really on the storyline.....though Austin Powers really isn't a movie you're going to see for the plot.  The whole movie really consisted of Mike Myers having A LOT of fun with all the characters and just goofing around.  I definitely recommend it for a good laugh...I can't wait to own it!",Austin Powers in Goldmember
227,magicp167,Yeah Baby!,10,29 September 2002,"Austin Powers third film and perhaps the best out of the three. In fact, I loved this movie so much that I saw this movie three times in the theater. It just gets better everytime I see it. With all the cameos and great actors and a great crew, this film is the best. Jay Roach (the director) does it again. He knows how to shoot comedies and Mike Myers knows how to make them. So, this Austin Powers movie should be seen by every person in the world. They can make a million of these movies and it still won't be enough. So, I hope there's more Austin Power films to come around. Yeah Baby!",Austin Powers in Goldmember
228,jtenos,Horrible movie,2,13 August 2002,"This was not only the worst Austin Powers movie by far, but it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  The first movie was good, the second was great, so everyone expected this one to be oustanding.  That wasn't the case. This was dreadful, just a rotten movie on every level.  The comedy was either not funny or way too predictable.  I laughed 4 times throughout the entire movie. It's a real shame that the same people involved with two great movies could put together this piece of garbage, but it's true; avoid this movie at all costs; and don't say I didn't warn you.",Austin Powers in Goldmember

231,Cactus-5,"Better than the second, worse than the first",6,25 July 2002,"The second Austin Powers movie made a lot more money than the first one. I don't know why, because it was like a bad rip-off of the first. This third movie has more imagination than that, it has clearly toned down all the ""yeah, baby, yeah"" and gone more for zany wackiness. It has more than a few bellylaughs, but also a couple of annoyingly un-funny moments, such as all the songs, the dutch accent and the appearance of Fat Bastard.I enjoyed all the cameos, Seth Green goes nuts and Michael Caine is a lot less cringeworthy than when he plays straight drama. As with a lot of movies lately, about half and hour could have been cut from the movie, making it a nice 50-minute TV special.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
232,amanfigo,"¡¡ Yeah, Austin Myers!!",6,24 January 2003,"Mike Myers makes us laugh with the last and definitive again (or not) the secret agent's movie, bumpkin and English Austin Powers in this Goldmember. Myers returns with its jokes something clownish but very good and it also returns with its parodies of James Bond with the character Goldmember and the fictitious movie of Austin Powers (AustinPussy).I love the movie because it also combines jokes and references of the previous Austin Powers (The joke of the satellite and those of the sharks with laser), one can also see the father of Austin Powers (Michael Caine) paper that was about to incorporate is Connery. The movie also includes, for my, the best girl of the Austin Powers' saga, the singer Beyoncé Knowles (Foxxy Cleopatra) much better than Heather Graham and Elizabeth Hurley.
Not alone the humor of this film resides in the versatile Myers and in its characters (Dr. Evil, Fat Bastard...) but we can also spend well them with Mini-me (now Mini-Austin) and their endless weeds with Scott.
A very good blow of freshness for film is the one of including cameos like Steven Speilberg, Tom Cruise, Danny De Vito or Britney Spears (Uaauuuuhhh!!!).This is Austin Powers!!! Glamour, Amusement, Laughs, Action and a lot..... of Gold!!! This is the new movie of Myers with we can laugh it, the question that it comes us to the head is: Will there be Austin Powers 4?",Austin Powers in Goldmember
233,bobilene,Boring,4,8 March 2005,"""Austin Powers the International Man of Mystery"", was a gem almost equaled by ""Austin Powers, the Spy who shagged me"". The primary difference was the killing off of Elizabeth Hurly in II. In II, we were introduced to ""Mini Me"" who really makes II in spots, absolutely hilarious. We could have done though without ""Fat Bastard"". ""Gold Member"" has none of the class and fun of the first two. This viewer has tried on at least three occasions to get through this bore without success. Throwing in a number of big star cameos seems to be only a last minute producer gamble to give this bomb a shot in the arm. Stick and laugh with the first two and pass on this.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
234,grasshopper54,"Lousy, lousy, lousy!!! Only watch this film if you're a moron.",1,28 May 2003,"The first two Austin Powers movies were very good. So it wasn't difficult to be anxious about seeing Part III. Normally I don't go out to the movies in order to catch the `latest and greatest' features that are out, so I usually wait for them to become available for home viewing. My daughters saw this film on the wide screen and liked it. Compared to this one, the first two Austin Powers movies were exceptionally good and funny, especially The Spy Who Shagged Me. To put it mildly, I was extremely disappointed in this film. This one is a first class stinker. It has more than the usual 8th grade level `bathroom humor' that normally accompanies modern comedies of this nature (remember Wayne's World?). However, the writers make a desperate attempt to keep the plot afloat by overdoing it a bit. Nonetheless,  their attempt to use it to for the benefit of the plot fails miserably. Speaking of plot, there really is none. The overemphasized humor involving genitals and ""soft core"" swear words is stupid and adds to the absurdness of this movie. Film features cameos of Brad Pitt, Danny DeVito, Britany Spears and John Travolta among others in another possible attempt to add substance to the plot. Not!!! This stinker is a total schlockfest.  This is just another example of the junk that is available for sale, while some great classic films from the 40's and 50's go unnoticed by the powers-that-be.  Even the great classic `The Final Countdown' (1980) starring Kirk Douglas isn't available for sale, but this claptrap is. Go figure.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
235,diorio2001,Not too Great..... baby,3,31 July 2002,"It's very clear that Mike Myers was out to see how many laughs he could get with this film. Due to this fact little emphasis is placed on the plot and character involvement. One of the big problems with this movie is that it has so many characters that there is not enough time in the movie to see as much of each character as we'd like to. Goldmember is big on laughs but does lack much of the magic of its two prequels. Many of the jokes are redundant and some are just plain dumb. In my opinion Goldmember was a mistake and destroyed the glory of the Austin Powers' franchise, but I'm sure that the filmmakers would disagree with me due to the fact that Goldmember is breaking many current box office records and making the franchise a fortune. One thing that makes Goldmember really unique and entertaining is the amazing opening sequence. I give Goldmember a 3 out of 10.",Austin Powers in Goldmember

238,ZachsMind,"""You want fries with that?"" A sequel made to order...",3,28 December 2002,"There is what one perceives, and what one receives. If the two mesh, you got a sequel worthy of its predecessor's namesake. Usually sequels pale in comparison to their predecessors. There are very few rare exceptions compared the pile of unworthy swill. Occasionally a sequel will improve upon the formula of the original (Aliens, Indy & Last Crusade, Back To The Future 2, ST2 Wrath of Khan, Army of Darkness) but more often than not it's the opposite. Sequels attempt to recreate the success of the past by regurgitating similar plot elements in vaguely innovative ways. The result often falls flat (Star Treks 1, 3, 5 & 9, Indy & Temple of Doom, all the Jaws sequels, Highlander 2, Die Hard 3, Men In Black 2, Ghostbusters 2, Poltergeists 2&3, Weekend At Bernie's 2, the Police Academy sequels, Blair Witch Book of Shadows, anything with Jason, Freddy or Pinhead, etc etc ad nauseum), causing one to contemplate why anyone bothered to financially back such worthless drivel.
Then there's the rare gems. The ones who manage to pull it off. The sequels which are not better or worse than their predecessor, but rather successfully ARE what they claim to be. If you go to a favored restaurant a second time and order the same thing, you won't necessarily want a ""new and improved"" hamburger unless you specifically ordered that. You want what you got the last time. That's why you came back. Fast food & Hollywood sequels operate under similar principles. These rare sequels which hit the mark without going over, don't improve upon the formula. They also don't fail to entertain. They ARE the formula. Most noteworthy among these rare gems are the James Bond sequels. The brand ""James Bond"" is as delicious to some as the thought of a submarine sandwich or a good year of fine wine. One knows what to expect when they see that name, and rarely does an installment of the James Bond franchise disappoint. The Lethal Weapon series of films is another perfect example. Each film can stand alone but are also episodic. They deliver what they promise. Nothing more. Nothing less. If that's what you're in the mood for, pretty much any of the sequels to Lethal Weapon ""taste"" the same as the original, so you probably will not be disappointed, provided you like that flavor.
I'm not saying this is bad or good. I'm not saying this makes any sequel ART. It doesn't. I'm saying if you liked the first one of these rare gems, you'll like the rest, because they're prepared and delivered to you in much the same way a McDonald's delivers a Big Mac to your hands. They know what works and they stick with it, and give the audience what it wants.
All sequels seek to hit the mark of past glory, and the vast majority fall short. A precious few prove to be more than their name brand advertises and how can one argue against that? It's like ordering the Value Meal and getting it Biggie-Sized for free. Then there's an even smaller percentage that are precisely what you ordered. Goldmember is just such a creature.
If you liked Austin Powers & The Spy Who Shagged Me, you'll like Goldmember. It has something to offer newcomers to the series and also diehard fans of Myers. It's episodic but also stands alone. The casting of Michael Caine is sheer brilliance. Seth Green's given a chance to show his comedic chops. Some of the more juvenile blue humor seems forced and falls flat, but that's ironically part of Myers' charm. He's bucking against this trend I described above, which ironically works to his advantage. Goldmember laughs in the face of the odds stacked against it. It knows its a greedy attempt to rest on the laurels of its predecessors and it basks in that decadence, thus making it even more amusing for its very existence. After all, the Austin Powers films are ultimately designed to make fun of the very concept of sequels, lampooning perhaps the most successful series of films of all: James Bond. So how can it not fail to entertain even when it fails to be worthwhile? It's making fun of itself and every other sequel, good or bad, that's ever been written. Quite a task. However, the novelty of this parody is wearing off, and the next Austin Powers film will either have to reinvent itself, or fall into repetition in a way that'll make Police Academy 5 look almost like art.",Austin Powers in Goldmember

Don't go expecting a labyrinthine plot, Oscar-cailber acting or a rousing John Williams-esque score.

But I laughed more in the first 10 minutes of ""Goldmember"" than I did in all of ""Men in Black II.""  In the end it's Myers' comedic ability that makes this third entry in the series fly.No, there haven't been very many good comedies this summer.

It starts off well with a really funny pre-credits sequence but after that it goes downhill. There are a few hilarious moments throughout but not enough to stop you from leaving disappointed.

Michael Caine was superb as Nigel Powers. An excellent piece of casting. Mike Myers is also great as Austin, Dr. Evil, Fat Bastard and new character Goldmember. Verne Troyer is also wonderful. The best parts of the film are the cameos at the beginning and towards the end of the film. I won't mention the stars featured but it's worth waiting for. As much as I would like to see more Austin Powers, I think now's the time to stop. Everything has been wrapped up and there isn't really any other direction the franchise can go to.To the makers of the film: Quit while you're ahead. Don't let the saga drag on and on.

244,Joekingfans,"Preparation: Hilarious! Yeah, Baby!",7,26 July 2002,"It's tough to top yourself, but Mike Myers has done it.  ""Austin Powers in Goldmember"" isn't just the best of that shagadellic franchise; it's Mike Myers best film ever.  ""Goldmember"" is better equiped to blow away box office records than Dr. Evil's giant laser!I laughed so much I had to take off my Austin Powers glasses a few times to wipe the tears away.As a long time fan of the James Bond film series, I've always enjoyed the teasers each Bond film begins with.  ""Goldmember"" begins with a teaser better than any of the 20 Bond films.I own a copy of ""Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,"" and I've watched it dozens of times.  My 11 year old son can even do impressions of Dr. Evil and Fat Bastard.  Thus, I took my boy and a friend of his along, and my son kept poking me because I was laughing so hard it was embarrassing him in front of his friend.  Look for ""Goldmember"" to set a new record for DVD sales.  I know I'll be watching it again and again.I was driving them home from the movie with my boy and his friend, and I said, ""Hey, that movie that Austin Powers was watching in the theater at the end of the movie was the same one Tom Cruise and Danny DeVito were filming at the beginning....""They then both said, in unison, ""You JUST figured THAT out?!?""I really see this movie as a stepping stone for Tom Cruise.  He sold that ""Yeah, baby"" line quite well, so be on the lookout for Tom Cruise to be in all-out comedy movies in the future--and not just ones that parody his status as an Action/Adventure hero.While other critics may view the Goldmember character as disappointing, you have to realize the bind the writers were in.  I'm sure they would have loved to have made the character just like Auric Goldfinger--but if they tried that, the producers of the James Bond film series would have levied an injunction.  The writers did the best they could given the circumstance.When we look at the Bond films, notice this:Of the Sean Connerys, the 4th one, ""Thunderball"" was the coolest one.Of the Roger Moores, the 4th one, ""Moonraker"" was the coolest one.While they've said that this film concludes the Austin Powers franchise, please bring Austin back for a 4th time for ""the cool one.""As for the soundtrack, featuring Burt Bacharach and the others, I feel an Academy Award is in order.I especially enjoyed the reference that Robert Wagner made that while Doctor Evil was out in space, his resources had been used to create the talent agency ICM, which has A-list stars like Julia Roberts.ICM really is one of the ""Big 3"" talent agencies.  If they'd said, ""William Morris,"" everyone would have laughed, but when they used ICM, I was probably the only one in the audience who appreciated that one.There was also a moment when an image that looked like a pair of womens breasts appeared on the radar screen.  They jump cut to a few different scenes similar to the sequence in ""The Spy Who Shagged Me.""  My son and I agreed that it should have gone on longer than that in ""Goldmember.""I'm going to go back and see ""Goldmember"" again, but instead of bringing my boy and his friend, I'll have to bring two shagadellic babes!

If you didn't know of the Powers dislike for carnies (""Small hands, smell like cabbage"") from the first movie, the joke would just fall flat.

The plot is slightly better than ""Spy who shagged me"", but nowhere near as imaginative as the first one.(It is also strange to note, that in the third installment, they have strayed completely from the storyline of Austin being a fish out of water after being frozen for 30 years.

255,RLove,"Tired, shagged out series. PS: Woody Allen?!?",3,11 August 2002,"The first two Austin Powers movies were funny.  The third one is a pretty bad rehash.  The jokes are just tired now.  Some of the parts were rather funny, but this just wasn't up to par with the rest of the series.  The humor has slipped further and further down the scale, ending (I hope) here with Goldmember.  This one is almost exclusively toilet humor.  That, of course, is exactly what most people want.And I have to respond to the person who thought Goldmember parodied Woody Allen.  I'll grant that Austin resembles Woody Allen with his glasses, but I don't think it's an intentional parody.  The subtitle humor was NOT a parody of Annie Hall--parodying requires some sort of resemblance to the original work, and aside from the subtitles, that is non-existent.  The scene in question was not showing their thoughts, only an understandable version of the words.  It is, however, still derived from an earlier film: the original (and better) version is in Airplane.  If anywhere, I think that's where the reference lies.  I haven't seen Purple Rose of Cairo or Stardust yet, so I can't comment on those.  Personal opinion, while there might conceivably be some references to Allen (from what the user said, the end is close to Stardust), there is very little Woody Allen influence in Goldmember. Allen's humor was a LOT better, and I couldn't help but feel a little sad when his name was mentioned along with this movie.A few funny moments keep Goldmember from being a complete waste of time, but I really wish I had waited for video.  3/10",Austin Powers in Goldmember

Although it was a quick one it still was amazingly good. Tom Cruise and Gweneth Paltrow make their way in the beginning of the movie as well as Danny Devito and Kevin Spacey.

257,filmbay,Truly Gilding the silly: Austin Powers in Goldmember,6,21 July 2008,"Say anything three times and it's funny, according to the secret rules of sure-fire comedy (the same rules that say the word ""chicken"" is unfailingly a rib-tickler). Austin Powers in Goldmember, Mike Myers's third incarnation of his gormless but irrepressible swinging sixties British spy, really is pretty funny.After three movies and six years of the shagadelic, flouncy-shirted, buck-toothed homunculus and his ever-expanding cartoon world, it's become easier to surrender than resist. Place it against Men in Black or Mr. Deeds or any of a host of other barren summer comedies and the difference is obvious: Myers's sheer fertility of invention is of a different order, and even if he misses as often as he hits, he's definitely a swinger.Even if the gag-to-wince ratio isn't high, there are enough punchlines thrown here to make a sphinx smirk. Father, forgive me, I must confess: I sprayed my popcorn.Powers, the self-adoring spy whom Myers says he invented one day while riding back from hockey practice and listening to Dusty Springfield sing The Look of Love on the radio, is not so much a spy spoof (the sixties were already crawling with spy spoofs) as nostalgic sixties anglophilia: Think of it as James Bond crossed with the Carry-On Gang, or maybe Jerry Lewis imagining he's Cary Grant. The character(s) -- Myers plays four parts here, three of them villains -- finds that tightrope between enviable childish narcissism and obnoxiousness where much comedy struts.The successor to the massive success of the $200-million second instalment of the series, The Spy Who Shagged Me, starts off with a large bang, and not, this time, of the sexual nature. Instead, it's a series of scenes from a film within the film, featuring a cast of stars way too famous to be named and an action stunt that should make the James Bond franchise pack up its product placements and go home.Dr. Evil, Myers's best character, with his pinky-chewing and air quote signs and poor ability at higher numbers, takes centre stage early. Having found a way of taking his unscrupulous behaviour into legitimate business by taking over a Hollywood agency business (he charges just 9 per cent instead of the usual 10), he's stationed himself in a lair above the Hollywood sign and is concocting one of his usual plans to blackmail the world's leaders for a largish amount of money.The entire evil cast (with the exception of the bald cat, Mr. Bigglesworth, who seems to have dropped out between trailer and movie) is back -- Dr. Evil's annoying son, Scott (Seth Green); Dr. Evil's silent clone, Mini-Me (Verne Troyer), who proves he has a mind of his own, and the rest of the Evil cast, including Number Two (Robert Wagner) and Frau Farbissina (Mindy Sterling). Myers hides himself under a couple of tonnes of makeup as an obese Scotsman, Fat Bastard, who is in love with his own body effluents.Myers also plays a new Dutch villain called Johann Van Der Smut, a middle-aged seventies playboy nicknamed Goldmember (regrettable smelting accident), who enjoys roller-skating, disco dancing and eating strips of his overtanned skin.The best piece of casting falls on the side of good, with Michael Caine as Nigel, Austin's swinging, and insufficiently paternal, spy dad. Caine (who himself played a bespectacled spy in The Ipcress File) looks the part, and turns on some real actor intensity, especially in his raging declaration that he hates intolerance and Dutch people.Austin, for some reason, has to travel back to swinging Manhattan to ""Studio 69,"" to rescue his dad, who has been captured by the evil Van Der Smut. There, he teams up with Pam Grier-inspired Foxxy Cleopatra, played by pop diva Beyoncé Knowles of Destiny's Child, who has great abs and a way of looking at Austin as if she just scraped him off the bottom of her platform shoes.There's no doubt that Goldmember has its long flaccid stretches, and a good deal of repetition of familiar gags: shadow play, inadvertently obscene subtitles and an assortment of euphemisms for genitalia. At times, Myers's toilet-bowl humour overfloweth.The strategy here is the basic Mel Brooks string o' gags school of comedy. While it's not high wit, it never stops trying and, occasionally, as in the prison-rap number inspired by Hard Knock Life from Annie, the results are inspired.A flashback to Austin and Dr. Evil's early days at the Intelligence Academy, for example, shows a savvy such scenes rarely manage; the young actors are close enough physically to the adult characters, but what makes it work is Myers's dubbing in their adult voices.Fourth-time Austin Powers is a spectre that can only arouse apprehension. No one can look forward to a bigger role for Van Der Smut (or bigger rolls for Fat Bastard). Who cares if Mini-Me decides to talk? But taking a page from the International Man of Mystery, let's not worry about the future when the present (and past) are groovy. When it comes to Austin Powers, three's a charm.

258,davishasrisen,Maybe be the best one,7,25 January 2003,I think its very funny. The character Goldmember gets funnier everytime i watch this movie. Mike Myers truly is a comic genius. I think they should however just get rid of the chicks in these movies. I dont think any of them have made impacts like in the James Bond movies. I do think mini me is the funniest part in the movies though. Are those sharks with fricking laser beams attatched to thier heads. Thats funny.,Austin Powers in Goldmember
259,jpd-5,Bring Your No Doze,4,13 August 2002,"I loved Austin Powers 1 and 2.  I eagerly awaited this one.  The trailers looked funny and a spoof on Gold Finger sounded perfect.  I was sorely disappointed.  This movie just doesn't work.  Goldmember is a poor sequel to Austin Powers 1 and 2.  The humor has digressed from the realm of clever to stupid.  Wait for this one on video, it's not worth the price of admission. (By the Way:  Rent it, don't buy it)",Austin Powers in Goldmember

Ozzy Osbourne said it best in the film when he noted that the breast joke was simply a repeat of bits we've seen in the other 2 films.  When not ripping themselves off, the filmmakers apparently thought it would be funny if Dr. Evil mumbles incoherently, or takes one in the groin or Mini-Me runs into a wall.  The only ones in the theater laughing were the 10 year olds this material was apparently aimed at.  I can honestly say I did not laugh once, the first time this has happened since the 80's debacle Howard the Duck.  I went to the film with great apprehension, since Austin II was such a major letdown after the first, cult classic film.  Seems there's a law of diminishing returns applied to this series.  I'm just disappointed that the IMDB won't let me rate lower than 1, so I'll do it here: 0/10.",Austin Powers in Goldmember

Jokes intended to be funny were ridiculous. All of the new jokes were funny, Unfortunately, they were few and far between. This is such a horrible way to end the series. I loved the second movie. Third time is NOT a charm. The new characters introduced were unfunny, The old ones, even worse. Austin has DEFINITELY lost his mojo. I laughed maybe three times.

263,RafiSteinger,Worst Movie Ever,1,5 March 2007,"The 3rd Austin Powers movie tragically fails to not only bring justice to the trilogy, but to the movie industry in general. While attempting to close plot holes and introduce new characters, the movie sells out with advertisements and B grade celebrity cameo's (such as Britney Spears, whose presence displays a mockery of the entertainment industry in general). The portrayal of Dr Evil also tragically does no justice to the original movie. Dr Evil was a recreation of a classic Bond villain, who was a calm and twisted genius. The funniest part of Dr Evil was that behind his maniacle smile, his plots fell apart. Adding the dancing, songs, and ability to get out of his chair (a joke from the first movie) took away from the originality that made him funny. Overall, his character is ridiculously over-the-top. Additionally, there aren't any new jokes behind the glitz or glamour. Instead, the movie tries to sell the audience on repeated gags and finished plot lines that ultimately make this movie a wasted ticket. Furthermore, it takes away from the innovative style Myers brought to the forefront when he introduced the Powers character. Overall, don't see this movie. Buy the first Austin Powers and forget that the rest of them exist.",Austin Powers in Goldmember

I'll admit I laughed quite hard at certain points in the film.  However, on reflection, I can barely remember what it was that made me laugh, which suggests it wasn't really all that funny.  After a pretty darn entertaining opening sequence, things take a turn for the sour - the character Goldmember is remarkably unfunny - I don't think he gets a single laugh the entire film, the product placement and obvious ""MTV video"" moments from The Spy Who Shagged Me are back and even more prevelent than before.SPOILERS - some of the cameos were extraordinarily humorous, without naming names, but the Britney Spears appearance was cold, calculated, and incredibly unfunny (the audience didn't react at all).  And the Osbournes really need to go away. END SPOILERSEveryone is probably going to go see this movie, so go right ahead.  But Beyonce, for all her attractiveness, is a worse actress than Heather Graham (Believe it!  It is actually possible to be worse than Graham was in the second film), and there's just a lot less to laugh at.Michael Caine is a highlight as Nigel Powers.  And I enjoyed Mini-me more in this one than in the last.  And as I said before, there ARE some good laughs.

(Spoilers)",1,2 August 2002,"Well this movie was good and bad, really funny, almost worked for me, but had alot of things missing and gone wrong, I think. First what happened to Heather Gram's character? Why not just end it with her before you start another movie. And all the cameos were cool, but did we need to hear ""Hey look its Briteny Spears!"", that was pretty annoying to say the least. And they added a little extra to this movie than the rest, the thing that made you snap out of the movie, out of the fantasy of Austin Powers, and snap back to reality because they keep on reminding you that ""its just a movie"". I think they could have done without that. It's a movie, people watch movies to be immerse in it, and those little things made you come out of it. Don't get me wrong this movie has some good laughs, but real fans of Austin Powers, might be somewhat annoyed with some things that happen within this movie.",Austin Powers in Goldmember

I dont usually do that because you get someone elses opinion stuck in your head while your watching it.When you make a franchise such as austin powers, people will ultimately compare the recent film to the last in order to critique it. I had watched both austin powers films before seeing Goldmember, The first one has a few small jokes that dont work...the second one tries very hard to be funny, whilst still having a plot. And the third seems to totally forget a plot and just try to link the jokes up. Most of the lines falling flat. When you do laugh, you laugh hard.. but its too far between laughs. The musical numbers didnt work in No. 2 why did they think they would work in 3? I could hear a cricket there was that much silence.The mole character's interactions with members of the cast proves its biggest laugh point. and Fat bastard is gross yes, but he actually helps ease the flow of stale humour. The opening musical number as the credits roll stinks. It was done much better in 2. Overall, if this didnt have the ""austin powers"" name on the script it would have been straight to video.

It not only spoofs the Blaxploitation films of the 70's but Harry Potter and other up to date movies.  It has a large ensemble of cameos most notably was Danny Devito as Mini me and Nathan Lane.  The movie is not just a comedy but also a musical, where we see Dr. Evil and Mini-me do a rendition of Hard Knock Life (Jay-Z) it is one of the funniest scenes in the movie.  Beyonce Knowles does a suprisingly good in her acting debut. And Mike Myers, Michael Caine are good in it.  I would see it again.  Very Funny movie.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
271,alecsaved,How could this be?,2,16 August 2005,"Austin Powers II is one of the few movies that I went to see twice at the cinema during its run there. I bought the DVD as soon as it came out and have watched it many times since. I mention this because I had high expectations for AP III. I could spend a lot of time extolling the comedic virtues of AP II, and then simply tell you that AP III has none of them.There are many scenes and devices from AP II that are re-tried in AP III. None of them work. The reason they do not work, in my opinion, is because instead of infusing more originality they just infused more vulgarity. Now mind you, I think a fart joke is as funny as the next guy, or my 8 year old daughter. There is hardly anything witty or original (as I mentioned) about this movie, but instead is a layering of silly, over-the-top bodily function and sexual humor. The script is hardly engaging, and the plot is confusing and disjointed. And Beyonce, she's no Heather Graham in any way shape or form. The Goldmember character is weak, not entertaining to look at, and does not play a prominent role in the movie when compared to Dr. Evil. They could not even get past him. And the ending... it's as schmaltzy as, well, an estranged family reunion.If you have not seen this movie, I suggest only watching it if you can borrow it from a friend, have 2 hours to kill (I started cleaning out the junk drawer in front of the TV after 20 minutes) and be prepared for an endlessly rippling wave of mindless low-bro 'humor'. If that's your thing, no doubt it's your friend's thing too and you have likely already been talked into seeing it or even own it.No wonder you can get the deluxe collector's edition at Columbia House for $5.95; it's hardly worth more. I highly recommend Undercover Brother - original and FUNNY.",Austin Powers in Goldmember

Accents for different characters, and a funny way to show off each character. All Mike Myers characters is really different, so really well made!5/10 Effects - Remember! It's an old movie.

275,dbuffalo,Perhaps the worst movie I have ever seen....,1,27 July 2002,"This one has to go down as the worst movie I have seen since Bill Murray's ""Where The Buffalo Roam"". ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" is like ""Citizen Kane"" compared to ""Goldmember"". I don't think even Ed Wood would have ever touched this project if something like it were ever offered to him during his career.When producers and directors have to drag out actors (and morning TV hosts) whose careers are in utter decline as a draw for a picture, you know a film is in deep trouble. Eighth-grade humor is fine in proper context, but eighth-grade humor that has been tried, retread, and worn out is just plain abominable. This film is full of recycled tripe.Watching this film is like watching a really bad Bob Hope Television Special with the added effects of bathroom humor and foul language. I was actually thinking the coming lines in my head before the actors said them. My thinking the lines is a sign that a film is embarrassing poorly written or that I have a great career ahead of me as a screenwriter. I sincerely doubt the latter of those two alternatives.About the only redeeming slapstick element in this film is the ""small"" part of Mini-Me by Verne Troyer. If Troyer gets paid only scale (as he was in his first film appearance) and Myers gets paid 20 million, Congress should immediately launch an investigation. That pay plan would be a bigger crime than anything Ken Ley or Sen. Ted Kennedy were ever involved in. While Troyer may suffer the fate of all actors who serve bit parts in serial films, he can certainly perform first-class physical humor. He should try one of those groin punches in real time to Myers offstage if he gets stiffed in the wallet for his performance.Myers is so incredibly predictable in this film, it is beyond description. His humor is both badly timed and gratingly repetitive. It amazes me how people see him as being humorous. Michael Caine should have his knighthood (and other things) removed from him for just showing up for the casting call.Do yourself a special favor. Don't go see or rent this film. Save your money for a better time somewhere else....YEAH BABY!",Austin Powers in Goldmember
276,robert_montana,An average comedy.,6,17 September 2008,"I love the Austin Powers series, but I feel like this effort was my least favorite of the three thus far. If you were to watch the first movie, then the second, and then finally ""goldmember,"" you will undoubtedly see how the characters become so overblown by the third film, drastically different then how they were in the first film. Take for instance Dr. Evil, who in the first movie was almost serious, and anything comedic was often very subtle, not trying for the laughs, but getting them in a unique fashion. In ""goldmember,"" however, evil is completely out of character and it gets almost ridiculous at times. Although these characters are all funny, they've all gone through their own ""personal evolution."" ""goldmember"" is filled with many memorable moments which is why I still have respect for the series. The opening of the movie is probably one of the greatest openings for a comedy I have ever seen. I'm sure many can agree to that. The whole part with Mr. Roboto is witty and smart, poking fun at our use of subtitles. The movie also has another great scene behind a curtain, which mirrors another scene in the second movie, where it looks like heather graham is pulling grenades, rats, umbrellas, and other objects out from Austin's behind. However, the scene in ""goldmember"" involves Austin and Mini Me in a hospital room during a rountine physical. I also have respect for Mike Myers himself, who plays the parts of 4 characters in Austin, Dr. evil, fat bastard, and goldmember. So all in all, an alright comedy. It has its moments, but it also has those moments that just go too far and are completely off base with what the first movie in the series was trying to illustrate. I've heard that a fourth picture is most likely in the works, which I hope they can turn around the series with a final movie that Austin Powers fans truly deserve.",Austin Powers in Goldmember

Gone are the utterly histarical bits (Will Ferrell very badly hurt, and Dr. Evil's monetary miscommunications with the president), welcome are the unimaginative, silly jokes.  The villian Goldmember is very weak, we know little about him and frankly don't care.  The worst part of the entire movie though wasn't the movie.  It was the people who had just seen the other 2 Austin Powers' movies months back, hopped on the bandwagon and were laughing throughout the entire movie just for the sake of laughing. **The funniest part I felt was the explanation of Austin's mother's death.  The car suddenly blows up and Austin explains his mother's carcus folded around him to form a protective barrier.

However a mate of mine lent me the DVD yesterday and I thought I'd give it a go - although I was fully expecting to hate it. I was wrong - this made me laugh a lot, especially some of the cameos early in the film. Plus of course, you could actually have sympathy with Austin again due to the father-son relationship wonderfully played by Michael Caine. The only thing that detracted from my enjoyment of the film was the inclusion of Fat Bastard, who remains as unfunny as a terminal illness.

Most of the gags that were brought back from the previous movies were only touched briefly, unless they were making fun of it and then it was a little more gratuitous.Verne was hilarious throughout and got lots of screentime.  Beyonce Knowles got plenty of screentime, but I thought Heather was better as the obligatory t&a sidechick.  Seth Green got more screentime and he was funny again.  (I still can't believe he does Chris' voice in Family Guy).  I was disappoint ed in Mindy Sterling's screentime.

In order to stop him, Austin must travel back to 1975 and rescue his father Nigel Powers (Michael Caine) from Dr. Evil's newest henchman, Goldmember (Mike Myers, again!) and form an alliance with ex-girlfriend Foxxy Cleopatra (Beyoncé Knowles), then travel back to 2002 to stop Goldmember, Dr. Evil, and the rest of his infamous gang of henchmen.Even though this installment is the funniest of the three (the first 10 to 15 minutes of the movie is a riotous hoot with cameos galore), Goldmember is the weakest link of the series. With his testicles made of gold and having a weird attribute of eating his peeled skin, it almost makes you sick to your stomach in some scenes. The other let down of the movie, Heather Graham had a cameo appearance as Felicity Shagwell and all her scenes ended up on the cutting room floor. Oh, well. The revelation is unexpected (except to those who saw the first two movies), and the ending leaves the door open for a fourth Austin Powers adventure. Funniest moments are the first 15 minutes of the movie, the clever & witty names of female characters (and everybody who thought  `Fook Yu' was a bad word will now be grateful to say in front of parents. Don't worry, they won't get it until DVD release), Dr. Evil's version of a Jay-Z rap song, Dr. Evil's new lair, the satellite (which is reminiscent of number two's funniest moments), the battle between Austin and Fat Bastard (Michael Myers from those `Halloween' slasher films), and Fred Savage as The Mole.

Also, you can see Mike Meyers is an SNL alumnus because some of the gags fall victim to the SNL-problem; they drag on so long they stop being funny.On the good side, the opening ""surprise"" was great fun, and the casting department did a fantastic job with the actors playing the characters as teens.",Austin Powers in Goldmember

289,Cquacks77,The worst of the trio but not horrible,6,25 July 2002,"I just got home from viewing a sneak preview of ""Austin Powers in Goldmember"" and have mixed feelings.  Although i found myself laughing at the usual comedy of the group it seemed that it was old jokes renewed.  The shadows showing dirty things and Austin holding a gun yet never shooting anyone. This is much a family film so don't get me wrong, I don't want him to run around killing people.  In this installment Scott wants to take over the evil thrown after his father and be as evil or more as him.  A sudden but inevitable and obvious twist alters the film making it more a feel good comedy then the battle of good and evil.  6/10, I still like the first one most of the trilogy and although this isn't horrible, it isn't that good either.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
290,sallyweltrop,Save your Gold - this movie is NOT funny!,1,11 August 2002,After 2 minutes I knew this movie was going to be bad but I lingered in the hope that it would get better. it did not ... in fact the bathroom jokes got worse and the humor was awful. The first Austin Powers movie was good but after that it just keeps getting worse. Even the other people in the audience which numbered about 75 hardly laughed at the movie so I know it just was not me. Probably the most creative part of the movie is the opening and then it falls flat on its face.There is not even an apparition of what really is the theme. The movie was just done up to make money with no real passion in the acting OR creative aspect of really making a funny movie.This has got to be one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time.,Austin Powers in Goldmember
291,soonerhokie,"Rehashed, but not all that bad",6,29 July 2002,"I liked it. I probably should have waited for video, but this is a fun movie, if not original. They do the shadow scene again. They do the Dr. Evil v. Scott thing again. They do most of the funny things from the previous movies again. The scenes are funny. There are a few new bits, but there is nothing that made me think that this was a classic like the first two were. Wait for video. Watch it when all you want is a little fun.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
292,leggygal_7,"Gold baby, yeah!!",8,26 September 2002,"I was prepared for disappointment on this little niche's 3rd installment, but what I got was a bellyful of laughter. While the pace of the movie suffered a little from its sketch like format, there were no complaints from this punter. I mean even Britney Spears shone in her little cameo! What do you mean u haven't seen it yet, get thee to a cinema now!!!! Shazaam!!",Austin Powers in Goldmember
293,DarkFire639,One Of The Funniest Films Ever Made,9,20 August 2002,"Austin Power's latest adventure in ""Goldmember"" is one of the funniest movies ever made. From the unexpected beginning to the hilarious out takes and skits during the final credits, this movie is everything a funny movie should be. This movie follows Austin Powers on the search for his missing father (Fa-ja) played by Michael Caine. He teams up with his new side kick Foxy Cleopatra, well played by Beyonce Knowles, to chase Dr. Evil and the sinister Goldmember to get him back. I think some of the funniest parts in this movie are when Austin goes back in time and meets ""Foxy"" for the first time, and when he meets Mr. Roboto and has to read his subtitles. The cameos made in this movie from such stars as Tom Cruise, Danny DeVito, John Travolta, and The Osbournes are also very funny. I would have to say that this would be a good contender for best comedy along with ""Airplane."" I recommend this to anyone who wants to be in stitches in the first 5 minutes of a movie.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
294,leo-pontinen,A dorky movie hidden behind the word : a comedy,1,5 November 2010,"First of all, this was said to be a comedy, so, I watched it as a comedy, categorized it as a comedy and criticized it as a comedy. Still, I couldn't help but feel insulted and as if I was a complete fool having watched it through. The emotions that this movie raised weren't positive at all. I hated this movie.Here is the main reason: the cast didn't take anything seriously. Everyone acted like they knew that they were in a comedy. This is a humor killer for me. I hate watching people mug at the camera and being complete fools. Every time when I look at something like that, I always think: ""Wow... These people really get millions for doing this..?"". Their responsibility is to take the audience seriously. It doesn't matter if it's a comedy, drama or a thriller. If they don't care, why should I? Second, the intelligence levels were just obnoxious. The writers clearly just threw whatever mediocre they could had come up with and trusted that the audience was ignorant enough not to realize how dumb it was. Comedy movies can be clever and funny. There have been many which have challenged the viewer to understand the stuff at the screen. That's respectful and enjoyable.Final words: There are so many other options where you should rather spend your time and money. Actually, this movie would probably harm the IQs as well, so it might be dangerous as well.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
295,Dombear50,A lot of ideas but nothing happening,3,14 October 2002,There are a lot of ideas floating around here but none of them are ever developed into extended gags or set pieces. Lots of self-referential guest appearances fall flat and the plot seems to be a jigsaw of bits leftover (or photocopied) from the two previous films. Instead of set pieces we get grubby gross-out toilet humour or half-baked musical numbers (but never a whole song).,Austin Powers in Goldmember
296,scissors1,About what I expected...,4,28 July 2002,"I'll put it simply.  This is the kind of movie where you feel guilty forlaughing because you know how stupid the jokes are.  Goodopening sequence, but other than that it was just predictable gagsand recycled jokes. Still, it had it's moments...5/10",Austin Powers in Goldmember
297,KSCfilmstudent,Tries too hard,4,5 August 2002,"This film has its moments but they are simply moments with a lot of failed jokes in between. The first Austin Powers was groundbreaking and excellent, the second played off of that and was unusually good for a sequel although not as good as the first, and this latest third installment just struggles throughout.The opening sequences lend themselves of the humor from the first, but they quickly fade. Many of the jokes from the first two are simply reused and are no longer funny since we know what is going to happen either from seeing the previous films or the many parodies that stemmed from them.
Mike Myers still has potential in the characters of Austin and Dr. Evil and both do have good scenes but there was a lot more that could have been done but was not. Goldmember is rather 2 dimentional and Fat Bastard who was excellent from the second installment, seemed to be added in as an afterthought. Suprisingly, Scott seems to be the most developed character in this film.The franchise has been milked for all it is worth and is in evident decline. Unfortunatly there is an opening for a fourth film. Please, leave the franchise with some dignity and do not make a fourth.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
298,Devizier,Awful!,1,14 August 2002,"When the original Austin Powers came out, I was pleasantly surprised. The movie was amusing, the parodies were well executed and the comedy was spontaneous. Most importantly, the movie had a sense of flow. Watching the second Austin Powers was more of a chore, with lots of uncomfortable lags and plenty of holes (Heather Graham was terrible in that movie).When the previews came out for the third installment, I was reluctant. After all, I had remembered how bad the second movie was, and the casting of Beyonce Knowles sent up all sorts of alarms off in my head. However, I was swayed by the positive reviews from the mainstream critics. I put aside my prejudice, paid my $7.00 and saw the movie. Boy, I wish I could have that $7.00 back.This movie was so slow and beyond unfunny, I was in a state of disbelief for about two hours after it ended. I couldn't believe that someone could allow such a rancid product to hit the movie theaters. People can defend this movie left and right, but the fact is, no one in the theater was laughing. I can't imagine anyone who isn't ridiculously biased could have possibly enjoyed this movie. I suppose it is all about money. I wonder how many critics the studio bought with all those product placements.My grade: 2/10",Austin Powers in Goldmember
299,evil_monkey2007,Goldmember = Pretty Good!,7,19 April 2007,"Okay so this film has been reviewed at the cinema already, so I'll save the story details. I won't even mention the great opening sequence or the truly hilarious turn by Sir Michael Caine. Although both are highlights of the film.Lets just get straight to the DVD. And what a great DVD it is. I wasn't the biggest fan of the film, but history has taught me that the Austin Powers DVD's are always a top buy.Take for instance the special features. The deleted scenes, as with the second Austin powers DVD, shine through and present a series of cut sequences and gags which are, quite frankly, funnier than 90% of the scenes in the films. It's odd but these collections of gags seem almost to work better by themselves and show how strong, when stripped down and without the need for a story, Myers creations are.On top of that, after the almost 15 mins of deleted scenes, is a very funny selection of outtakes, showcasing Myers talents at their best (Dr Evil/Austin Powers) and worse (Fat Bastard/Goldmember). Simply hilarious.The rest of the DVD  documentaries, scene break downs and music videos are good also and prove how much the medium of DVD can shine when time and effort are taken with it.If your not a fan there's little here that will convince you otherwise, but Austin Powers fans will rejoice in this DVD. It the words of the man himself ""Yeah, Baby, Yeah!""",Austin Powers in Goldmember
300,Raptor in Black,It seems that what Austin Powers is mostly parodying now is...Austin Powers.,8,29 July 2002,"**Uber-Spoilers**My newspaper's movie review made this comment about the movie, and after seeing it I am highly inclined to agree. Still, i found it very funny and entertaining. Better than the 2nd, though still not as good as the 1st.There is a fine line between re-hashed jokes and running gags, and in my opinion this movie leans more towards the latter.  The jokes are made with a tounge-in-cheek attitude, indicating that the writers know that its the same stuff and know that we know its the same stuff and want us to know that they know that we know its the same stuff.  In comparison, MiB2 failed because it slipped in old jokes and acted like it didn't know they were the same. For example, in Austin Powers 3 there is yet again the old thing with Dr. Evil and Scott trying to hold a conversation in which half of the dialouge is Dr. Evil trying to shut Scott up, but in this case once the exchange starts, Scott essentually goes, ""Oh ok, I know how this goes, I say something, then you go ziipshhh!, and then I go...""  Thus, it becomes more of an in-joke than anything else.There are a lot of original cameos and pop culture references, most of which were lost on the teeny-bopper crowd I saw the movie with (there was a girl who actually had a Britney Spears shirt on and who shot me an angry glance when me and my friends boo'ed as Britney came on screen).  I mean, apparantly I was the only one in the theater who knows who Nathan Lane and Michael Caine are, and while I saw the Mr. Roboto reference coming from a mile off, for the most part it didn't even get a giggle from the rest of the theater. I guess they were too busy laughing at the wang jokes and at Goldmember eating his own flaking skin (Where the hell did that come from, anyway!?)I gave the movie an 8 out of 10 because I enjoyed it, which is what counts, and because of the part when Scott opened the tank on the floor and I, along with my friends, immediately squealed, ""Sharks with laser-beams!!! :D""",Austin Powers in Goldmember
301,TheUnholyArmpit,"8 hours after seeing this movie, and im still chuckling",9,25 July 2002,"First let me get this out of the way, im a big Austin powers fan, its probably the very British humour. But this movie is something else....Its the normal mix of James Bond spoof, and innuendo - which is fantastic. But here we actually get treated to a bit of a plot. Mini-me gets a bigger part - no pun intended (unless you find that funny, in which case it was intended).Now, im not one of those people who need to put spoilers in a review just to prove that ive seen the movie... All i`ll say is that if you dont laugh at Mini-me in a pillow case or MOLE!, or Scott`s comb-over, youre carved from stone. Yes, some gags are repeated, the rude shadow, the body part montage, Dr Evil`s song, etc, etc.On the whole, this film is worth any price you pay for the ticket. OK, its not Citizen kane, But it entertains wonderfully, and isnt that what films are for?What are you doing still sat there? Go and see this film!!!!!!",Austin Powers in Goldmember
302,dchristrev,"Things like the ""Prison Rap"" make this one worth the effort",9,30 June 2004,"I can put up with the over-indulgent flatulence/feces jokes to see stuff like the inspired ""Prison Rap"" with Dr. Evil and Mini-Me...and I'm not even a rap fan! From the Babes shaking their booties, to the part where they have to ""bleep"" out what Dr. Evil is rapping (I swear I hear him say ""splooge"" in there!) it is by far my favorite part of the movie.Austin movies are all pretty much pop culture fests wrapped in the guise of film-making anyway, and you can't take it too seriously, of course.Fans familiar with Mike Myers' interest in hockey may recognize the sweater/jersey that Mini-Me is wearing during one part of the prison rap...behind the giant bling-bling chain around his neck is a Toronto Maple Leafs logo! Leave it to Mike to sneak that in his movie.I enjoyed this one at least as much as the first two...love it when Fat Bastard is hanging from the wire and says ""Oh, isn't this magical!"" It's moments like that keep me coming back to the A.P. trilogy. Oh, and Beyonce is a total babe! Not much of an actress, but what a Babe, and what a voice too!",Austin Powers in Goldmember

So what if some of the jokes were recycled... they were funny before and they were even funnier the second (or third) time.  I laughed my *ss off during the entire movie, with one exception: the ""issue - tissue"" scene which wasn't supposed to be funny. Granted, there was a LOT of potty humor, but it wasn't unexpected and was very funny (and gross).  This, as well as the other AP's, were much like ""American Pie;"" it was so juvenile I was embarrassed to say I watched it, but I've never laughed so hard in my life!I'd love to see another sequel, but I don't know how Mike Myers could make it any more funny... but where there's a will (and money), there's a way!",Austin Powers in Goldmember
304,ikramerica,Comedy Ahoy,10,26 July 2002,"Funniest movie in years, far better than the second film, more laughs than the first.  It has gotten to the point that the AP series not only spoofs other films, but it even spoofs it's first two films!  The audience was laughing for nearly 90 minutes straight, and with today's jaded and sophisticated audiences, it is hard to accomplish that.Is this high brow?  Of course not.  Plenty of toilet humor, and if you are Dutch, you might be offended, but then again, nobody ever picks on the Dutch, so hopefully, they can laugh with the rest of us.  And the humor wasn't as gross as the second film, which made it more watchable.  Even Fat Bastard was watchable.And wow is Foxy Cleopatra a good looking lady.

305,scerevisiaety1,Tired and distinctly unfunny,1,7 August 2002,"Some reviewers on the Internet have said that the opening scene of Goldmember is absolutely hilarious and likely the best part of the movie. From then on, they said, the film's jokes hit home less and less.The audience was silent through the opening scene of Goldmember when I saw it. They remained silent for the rest of the film. Those reviewers on the Internet were partially correct. The film did go downhill from the start, but the start was terribly unfunny itself. I liked the first film and the second was mediocre. What is good about the third one, Goldmember? The new female role is played well unlike the previous film. Verne Troyer gives a strong performance...well that's about it. The actor playing Austin's dad is great, but he's given nothing. As other reviewers have said, it was a mistake to make him exactly like Austin (just older). The humor has sunk to lower levels than before with NO intelligence to it. Sometimes films can make that work (Naked Gun and the like). Not this one. They reuse jokes from previous Austin Powers. That would be fine if they were still funny. They aren't anymore. It's now like a Saturday Night Live skit that needs to die. I could say more about this abysmal wreck of a film, including it's ridiculous ending, but it isn't worth giving a point by point critique.",Austin Powers in Goldmember

Baaaaah.Only the good old Monty Python films/shows back in time long before my mother and father ever thought of making me have ever been really excellent, humorous films, that was just plain hilarious because of their crazy story line, and insane sketches.However, the world is not lost. The Austin Powers trilogy is probably the most funny films I have ever seen, though they only beat Monty Python with and inch or two. Austin Powers is funny. It is humor, but it is only for people who like insanely stupid humor and some of us humans do.Mike Myers as Austin Powers is every real boy's big idol. He is the symbol of a male hero - the man you just want to become! He is AUSTIN POWERS!!!The 3rd film is so funny that I will not spoil anything for you!

Instead of creating new jokes, they simply waded in the ones the had already been made in the first two.  The Austin Powers series was brilliant to start with, and had been fading ever since.  Mike Myers would be smart to just leave it at this, instead of trying to come back with another.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
310,Alex H,If it 'aint broke don't fix it...Baby!,8,24 October 2002,"I sincerely hope this is the last Austin Powers movie.  There I said it. This should not be misconstrued as a criticism of the series in general but more of a 'don't flog a dead horse' warning to Mr Myers.  There is only so far one can take a comedy series before it starts to grate and if we never see those horrible teeth on screen ever again then the series will have survived, reputation untarnished.  The point is, this is a fantastic movie.As with all spoof movies the comedy is distinctly hit and miss (think Scary Movie, Hot Shots, Naked Gun and yes, even Airplane!).  Thankfully AP3 has a far greater percentage of hits than misses.  Some of the set pieces worked into this movie were absolute, unquestionable genius.  The scene with the fountain statue and the Japanese guard had me almost crying with laughter. Another fine & inventive set piece was the scene with the Japanese subtitiles.  Other fine examples were the Mole, Fat Bastards wire driven combat scene and another brilliant shadow scene, this time with Mini-Me instead of Felicity Shagwell.Acting wise, very impressive. Aside from the comic genius that is Mike Myers,this time adding a forth, politically incorrect villain in the form of the hilarious Goldmember (""Hi guysh!  I'm from Holland!  Isn't zat vierd?""), Michael Caine is perfectly cast as Mr Powers Snr, in a kind of lighter hearted 'Get Carter' sort of way.Credit must go, however, to young Beyonce Knowles.  Popstars who act are a mixed breed.  You have the good (David Bowie, Jennifer Lopez, Bjork), the average (Britney Spears, Ice Cube) and the bloody awful (Mariah Carey, Jon Bon Jovi, Mick Jagger).  Fortunately for her, the 21 year old is comendably realistic as the big-haired blacksploitation secret agent.  Surrounded as she is by a top-notch cast she can hardly fail to look good, but instead of riding the talent of her cast-mates as you might expect from a relative newcomer, Beyonce carries herself extremley well and doesn't look at all like she's reading off a piece of card (I'm looking at you Mariah!).Now we get to the part of AP3 that forced me to give it a lower rating than it might otherwise have got.  Scott Evil.  Now you may remember that in the first two movies, young Scott was one of the principle sources of entertainment with his frequent set pieces with Dr Evil.  Now call me cynical if you like, but turning Scott Evil...er...evil was about the worst thing they could have done to the character.  The whole reason he was so great was that he was a voice of reason within a organisation of evil geniuses.  You can also tell  that actor Seth Green, is uncomfortable in a role he used to relish, especially at the very end of the movie.Aside from this one gripe though, Austin Powers in Goldmember is a thoroughly entertaining spoof comedy, easily the best in the series and highly recomended to anyone who wants to be in stiches for an hour and a half.  It's not rocket science, but there's only so much arty-farty psycho-analysis movies you can stand.  Or is it just me?",Austin Powers in Goldmember

312,pretzel man,Can anyone say commercialisation?,2,15 August 2002,"Sigh. If you haven't seen Goldmember yet, I'm sure this and other negative comments won't stop you, but here are my two cents worth. As many people before me have said, Goldmember is the weakest film of the series, to say the least. I may have laughed five times, tops (four if you exclude the ""mole"" joke which was massacred over and over again on TV ads). I loved the first two, in both of which Mike Myers demonstrated a quirky sense of humour that caught me offguard and cracked me up (which is the sort of humour I like, not predictable and over-structured jokes - you see where I'm going with this). In this, the jokes are simply bad - incredibly bad. I mean, come on, the scene where Powers is talking to Mr. Roboto with the fill-in-the-gap subtitles came from the same guy who gave us, well, the first two AP movies? This is the crux of the matter; what in the hell happened?Either the studios decided to force Mike Myers against his will to do rehashes of the jokes that worked in the first two movies, or, the more likely, Mike Myers decided to put his feet up and make some friends in the entertainment and advertising industry (Heineken, anyone?). The sheer amount of cameos which some found to be worth their money, I found repugnant and detracting from the humour (albeit terrible) in the movie, although I totally agree with Ozzy. Then the plot. Dr. Evil is SUPPOSED to be bent on world destruction. Mini Me is SUPPOSED to be evil. Scott is SUPPOSED to hate his father. Powers is SUPPOSED to be unsentimental. It was what made them funny in the first place, dammit! Now we're given a completely pointless and unfunny flashback, ditto new character Goldmember, ditto return of Fat Bastard, ditto appearance of Michael Caine! Sigh. The potential for this movie could have been great. It could have easily stood up to The Spy Who Shagged Me (e.g. the underutilised spoof of Hannibal Lecter, etc.). But no, I had to endure two hours of boredom because I trusted the comedic genius of Mr. Myers. Bad mistake. I should have learned from Mr. Lucas.",Austin Powers in Goldmember

It's funnier, it's bigger, it has more of everything that made the first two movies the same.  The jokes are very funny the first time you watch the movie.  After a while, they may get old.  The movie is a spoof on many other movies, and it doesn't hold back one bit.  It's gross at times, but that's what makes it so funny (in a very uncomfortable way).  There are some very HUGE cameos in this movie by some very big stars that I won't give away, you have to see them for yourself, you will be surprised.  Score 8 of 10.",Austin Powers in Goldmember

Really i shouldnt have done that, because it sort of let me down!  I don't know what i was expecting but it didnt have that 'thing' i thought would b there!Don't get me wrong there were some very funny scenes and i did laugh out loud, but there wasn't really any plot to the film. I know Austin Powers is definatly not to be taken seriously but to be fair i was laughing at the jokes without really having a clue what was going on!Its obvious that this film was going to be a hit whatever they put in the film because everyone was going to go and see it purely because the first 2 were so good and many people, including me, love the AP films.  It was going to make millions without even trying - as soon as I found out there was going to be a 3rd film, i couldn't wait - i was definatly going to go and see it along with my other AP fanatic friends!So, yes i enjoyed it and yes i laughed a lot but some of jokes that they used from the last film didn't work quite as well. May b it was because they weren't origional, i dont know! I loved the first of these films and the second one was my favorite but to be fair i have watched them over and over again and they seem to get better each time because you always miss some things the first time you watch a film, so no doubt i will be watching this one again and again in the future. :)Another thing, most of the characters were brilliant but i really didnt get what was going on with 'Goldmember' - i didn't really find him funny! But saying that the others charaters were good and funny and the surprise appearences are brilliant! Although i did feel that Austin had lost some of his 'shagadelic' charm and his 'mojo' wasn't quite all there! Again i don't know why! Still on the whole characters were good. :)I know there are a lot of mixed feelings about this film, some absoultly love it, some, like me enjoyed it but felt it could have been a bit better and others hated it.Still as long as i enjoyed it thats the main thing and maybe next time i watch it i'll get the plot! (if there is one!)I think people should definaltly go and see it especially if they enjoyed the first 2, because its best to make your own opinions of a film!
It was funny and i laughed so im happy and there is no denying if there is a 4th Austin Powers going to come out i will definatly be seeing it! :)YEH BABY YEH!!",Austin Powers in Goldmember
316,TxCracker,Almost as amusing as staring at tropical fish.,1,4 June 2003,"I'm completely amazed that so many people claim to have laughed so hard at this lame comedic attempt. I thought the first two installments of the series were both full of hilarious slapstick, (""They're always after me lucky charms"", and ""What the hell did you eat?"") which gave me high hopes for this one. All the media hype and critical acclaim helped to reinforced my expectations. The opening scene was well-done and hilarious. Then, suddenly, the whole project died and rotted in a stinking heap. Jeez, I even TRIED to like it, but finally had to give up. All those stupid cameos seemed to have been thrown in out of desperation, to draw in stargazers and make up for a marked lack of writing ability. I got the feeling that all those stars just HAD to jump on the Austin Powers bandwagon to be in vogue Then, lines had to be written in for them, no matter how little they contributed to the quality of the film. Not one of the Myers characters had any decent lines. Corny, but not funny-corny, just groaner-corny. Fat Bastard's new personality didn't suit him at all. The thing that made him so funny before was his mammoth self-confidence that ran counter to his grotesque ugliness. He's not even good for a chuckle as the repentant, considerate type. Goldmember himself was just plain disgusting, with no comic value, and Dr. Evil's jokes just seemed to fall flat, one after the other, as did Austin Powers.To sum it all up in one word...BORING.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
317,kschwantes,Didn't Strike Gold,6,26 July 2002,"This film has some clever parodies, some witty dialogue, and some great cameos. Problem is...there is only some. In between these are infernal sequences composed of lengthy and purile concepts that are unfit fodder for swine. It is a true shame, the concept is good, and there is potential here. The cast has amazing talents such as Robert Wagner, Michael York, and Michael Caine. The characters' dialogue is not worked to it's fullest potential. I only wish that more time had been spent on writing, rather than pointless unintelligible jokes and funny faces.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
318,Silencio789,"Harry Palmer, yeah baby!",9,22 August 2002,"Austin Powers has always been seen as a James Bond  spoof and yet in many ways it is also a spoof of the Harry Palmer films starring Michael Caine. The glasses are certainly from Harry! In this film Michael plays Austins Dad and the homage is complete.The clever set piece Bond spoofs are less obvious in this film but there is a lot more low down filthy toilet humour. I found it hysterical and laughed from beginning to end.Beyonce plays a straight 1970s pastiche black sassy woman, but without any humour. This is okay but a shame given how good Heather Graham and Liz Hurley were in the first 2 films.The new villain is great, especially if you know the Dutch and can see how wicked the satire is.Production values are high, the end is cheesy, the movie within the movie is great.

I almost fell out of my seat laughing.  The rest of the movie didn't disappoint either.  Sure, the movie has childish humor in it.  Sure, the movie stops at nothing to ignite a laugh.  But, having said that, I am sure you weren't expecting a Frank Darabont masterpiece here.  Myers has positioned himself as the comedy master in Hollywood, and he and Jay Roach pull it off to a ""T"".The movie was so funny that I found myself laughing less and less as I became more and more desensitized to the humor.  This movie would have been 10 times funnier if they had given a 15 minute intermission in the middle to reset my funny bone.Overall, very, very funny movie with enough jokes and humor to make it funny the 10th viewing.",Austin Powers in Goldmember

Pretty funny, but not as funny as Austin Powers 2: The Spy Who Shagged Me.Should've given more dialog to Foxy Cleopatra (Beyonce Knowles from Destiny's Child); instead, she's just the next girlfriend for Austin, and not a more fleshed-out character, like Heather Graham or Elizabeth Hurley before her.The character of Goldmember, while not in the film a lot, could've been cut down a bit more. He isn't particularly interesting. He's not as evil as Dr. Evil, and not as disgusting as Fat Bastard, and comes off as a washed out amalgam of the two.Fred Savage, from TV's ""The Wonder Years,"" is good in his two scenes as ""the Mole."" It's Dr. Evil, as usual, who steals the show, however. And it's a pretty good show.Rating: BF.Y.I.: While in the movie we hear ELO's ""Evil Woman,"" King Floyd's funk classic ""Groove Me,"" and Bobby Darin's ""Beyond the Sea,"" Darin's song is not on the soundtrack, and absolutely awful cover versions of the first two make the album.

AP3 is different, with the hilarious fake opening, yet takes what was funny about the previous movie and rehashes it into something funnier.

They tried to cram in too much of the same jokes as were in the 1st and 2nd movies.  Plus with all the cameos and thin plot, this was definitely the worst Austin Powers movie yet.  What it boils down to is that they just tried to include way too much material but didn't really know what to do with it.  If there is another Austin Powers movie I hope they come up with some original material and don't just borrow jokes from previous movies.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
326,Lord Trephine,Not the best of the three...,6,6 December 2002,"I didn't quite expect that the last of the trilogy (and I hope it's the last one) would be that good. And indeed my expectations were met! I knew this judging by the trailer on tv which didn't make me wanna go to the theatre and watch it. Hence, upon viewing it on video, I didn't quite enjoy myself as much as the other two. The first two were very good but alas the ideas and jokes in Goldmember were not amusing at all. I do agree somewhat with some of the comments about the jokes were dry because they were basically used up in the first two. Once these ideas were exhausted, what else can Mike Myers do to make the third of the trilogy to be even funny. By pulling in famous celebrities such as Cruise, Spielberg, and even Britney Spears does Mike expect the audience to laugh at?Another complain is that Goldmember wasn't even used that much. In fact his role turned out to be important in the end but yet there was no character development for him as well as Foxxy Cleopatra. All the other characters feels like one dimension and what's with the mole? It was emphasized so much that it didn't need to be expressed. The only real character(s) I liked were Fat Bastard and Mini Me. Always a pleasure to have! And at the end when they show him losing most of the weight by some miracle diet that his stretched skin was showing and his neck looked like a vagina. That cracked me up. I also liked the music video while Dr. Evil and Mini Me was in jail depicting Jay-Z rapping style of ""It's a Hard Knock Life"". That was pretty good.Overall, it's worth taking a look and only 1 look.6/10",Austin Powers in Goldmember
327,AndyF-3,Not as good as the first two,6,4 August 2002,"While I am a big Mike Myers fan, as I was leaving the theatre I felt that he had just plain run out of material when writing this film. On the other hand, I needed to watch the first two films at home before I truly began to appreciate Myers' wit. Perhaps I'll like this one better if I see it several times. There was much less of a story line compared to the last films.I don't know who the targeted audience was, but to me the over abundance of scatological jokes became boring quite quickly. I feel that its a shame that this, his least worthy Austin Powers flick, grossed more the first week than the original film grossed in its entire existence.",Austin Powers in Goldmember

330,smartstrigz,"3rd in Series, 3rd in Quality",6,27 July 2002,"First of all, let me say that I really did enjoy this movie.  However, it does not live up to the other Austin Powers movies in the trilogy.Working at a movie theater, I had heard all day Friday from people exiting the theater that it was the best Austin Powers film yet, it provided endless laughs, and especially the opening scene was amazing.  I was greatly anticipating our private employee showing late that night, but what I saw instead somewhat disappointed me.Although Mike Meyers does a great job as usual in playing multiple characters, most of the jokes and plot was recycled from the first two movies.  The writers obviously tried to continue on from the best jokes from the 2nd movie, but they just aren't funny this time around.  There was such a lack of new content in this movie that it made the movie a little boring about 3/4 of the way through the movie.  Also, unlike the 2nd movie (The Spy who Shagged Me) which provided almost non-stop laughter, this one has much more down-time in which you have to wait for the comedic moments.  Thats not a big deal if what you wait for is worth it, but these comedic moments are definitely not worth the wait.  Sure, there were the few times when the audience all instantly roared in laughter, but those times were seldom.One of my biggest problems with this movie is not the recycled content, it is instead the overall theme of the movie: Goldmember.  I have never seen a movie named after a character with such a minor part in the movie. Goldmember does play a part in a few of the funnier parts of the movie, especially when Dr. Evil is having a little language/accent communication problem.  Other than that though, hes hardly even around.
Another drawback of the movie is the amount of other famous people in the movie.  Britney Spears makes a brief appearance, but has absolutely nothing to do with the plot.  She is simply in the movie to be in the movie. There are plenty of other brief star appearances, but I don't want to go into those because some people consider it extremely funny and I don't want to ruin it for you.  But...There is definitely one star that did deserve to be in that movie, and that is Beyonce Knowles.  I thought she was going to be just like all the other stars in it, playing a meaningless character and just in the movie for publicity, however she played her part to absolute perfection.  She was definitely the star of this movie, every time she was on screen you could count on some excellent acting and funny moments.Overall, the movie isn't bad, it just has a lot of drawbacks that will keep many movie-goers a little disappointed with the third installment of the series.  The series, which constantly pokes fun at other movies, now seems to be poking fun at itself at times, but yet the writers did set it up for another sequel... however they also set it up to end the series if thats what they want to do.  Go see Goldmember, you'll enjoy it, but be slightly disappointed.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
331,sorehand,"Good, but where's Mustafa?",8,26 July 2002,"Just one question. Where is hell is Will Ferrell? I missed the red fez, that George Hamilton tan, those dark sunglasses. If you're going to bring back some of the old jokes from the first two movies, how could you forget the whole Monty Pythonesque ""I'm not dead yet"" Ferrell sequence. Sheesh. It's like I'm taking crazy pills!Goldmember and the rest of the Austin movies are basically movies about movies, and this third installment of the franchise doesn't disappoint with its groovy cameos, becoming an obvious testament to its popularity. However, Hollywood making fun of Hollywood is nothing new, and if you're a fan of the celluloid you'll get most of the in jokes, despite having some mixed feelings about story and plot and all that other film school nonsense reserved for the uber critical.After attending a ""sneak preview""(Doctor Evil's hand quotations), I went with a rowdy preview-sneering retro Vespa scooter crowd. We must have been the oldest ones there. Everyone else looked like groupies for Spears and NSYNC. I wasn't so much disappointed with the movie as I was with the bad audience. The majority of these ankle-biting morons, not much younger than myself(I'm 24), seem utterly vacuous when it comes to pop culture history, or film history for that matter, and miss many non-toilet humor jokes because they're too busy thinking about that new surf movie ""Crush"" or the color of their new cell phone.You could hear crickets after some of the movies lines, not because the lines aren't witty or unfunny, but because the cell phone cattle don't do their homework. If they do laugh, they don't know why. They might know who Ozzie Osbourne is, but they've never heard his music. They've never heard of Michael Caine and can't fathom why he's in the film. And they have not a freaking clue about Styx and the whole Mr. Roboto gag.So, if you're decent with the pop culture mojo, you'll like this film for what it's worth. If you're not, then maybe you should stay home and chew your cud. Half the movie could fly over your twig and berries.",Austin Powers in Goldmember

You can only use the same gag so many times as ozzy osbourne was good enough to point out. Goldmember lacks the freshness of the first two films and in parts just makes us feel like we're going through the motions. i welcomed the new characters we were given in the first sequel mini me and fat bastard but goldmember just seems rather pointless unless that is the film makers have some  major issues with the dutch and on first viewing i thought beyonce knowles character foxxy cleopatra came across well but on second viewing just came off as rather annoying.Although all that said there is still a lot of fun to be had in goldmember all the austin powers regulars are back i particuarly enjoyed seth green's scott evil who has finally made the transition to evil and has won his father's love. the cameos from the beginning are excellent and seeing a certain pop princess's head blow up was rather satisfying.All in all i would recommend austin powers to anyone apart from the rare few that don't like the other films. I can happily say i was very pleased with goldmember i just think myers and new line cinema should leave the austin powers trilogy as the comedy phenomenon it is.I rate this a 7,Austin Powers in Goldmember

Whereas in two prequels you needed someone by your side to stop you from laughing, this time you needed someone to jolt you into a stream of laughter.Sure, there were a few good gags with more risque shadow antics and Mini-Me getting kicked around the room, but on the whole it was just lame. Goldmember was a potentially funny character who never brought a chuckle to my mouth, and the 'mole' gag(s) needed a whole bag of pre-emptive ""SHH!"".I kept wondering when the movie would get going...and I still am.

338,Ronald Quincy Dobbs,"Disjointed and awful, definitely the worst movie all year.",1,21 November 2002,"Back in 1997 Austin Powers created quite a buzz as a really funny James Bond parody that was a sleeper hit, I saw it and thought it was incredibly original and generally laughed my ass off for the entire duration. The characters were incredibly entertaining and fun and the movie didn't feel forced.However, this movie is the definition of forced. In the very opening you get Tom Cruise and Gwyneth Paltrow doing a very very unfunny Austin Powers movie parody (Note to writers: Self parody does not work in a parody!), and the movie proceeds to Austin powers opening by dancing for no reason (you can't really level the same claim at the first one because the scene was appropriately goofy and relevant for what it was) and for whatever reason Austin walks in on Britney Spears's set and blows her head up. Huh? Oh yeah, and there's a LOT of product placement in this movie, a LOT, to the point where it's annoying the viewer.Some of the bits that would've been funny for instance some toilet humor involving a fountain and a shadow puppets scene behind a curtain would've been very funny if they didn't go on for like 10 minutes and seems to drag.I won't even bother ragging on Beyonce Knowle's acting because her lines were incredibly stupid to begin with and she didn't have a very significant role, either she is really that bad or she's just there to cash a check.Overall the main problem I have with this movie is that all the characters were basically destroyed by it and the series has self destructed while they already intend to make new ones. Goldmember picks at his skin, can bend into gross positions, and has well, a gold member. Why am i supposed to care about this character? Do they intend to make him a recurring villain, because he's awful. Dr. Evil and Scott pull a role reversal, Fat Bastard is stretched (pun intended) beyond the bounds of all stupidity in this one, and he was a really awful character to begin with.Stay away from this tripe, I can't even lay blame squarely on the writers because even Michael Caine and Mike Myers sounded wooden and were just rattling off catchphrases.

I wish Fat Bastard could have been a bigger part. He should have kept Goldmember at home. Hopefully, the character won't return if there is another Austin Powers movie. The thing about this movie was there were too many characters for a 90 minute movie. Benowce Knowles was decent as Foxy Cleopatra, and she isn't a bad actress. Michael York is just plain Basil, Seth Green was not that good as Scott Evil as he was in the other Two movies, Robert Wagner is still sad as Number Two and Mindy Sterling as Frau Farbisina did not have that big of a role. Michael Caine was pretty good as Austin's father and Verne Troyer as Mini-Me was actually better this time than the last movie. The best part of the movie was the cameos.

Mike Myers is as always ingenious and hysterical in his roles as Austin Powers, Dr. Evil, Fat Bastard, and now, Goldmember.

After viewing the movie for the second time I discovered that it wasn't as funny and lapsed in that of acting. I think what brought the movie down was the drop of Heather Graham for Beyonce Knowles which made her roll dull and her acting was annoying and not very good. Also, the role of the man himself Austin Powers was a let down because of his non-interest for his modjo and women as he never came close to phisically wanting to be with a woman like he did in Austin Powers 1&2. He found himself more concerned with his dad and we always knew there was not so much of a difference with Dr Evil and Austin Powers but the end sought of ruined the whole Austin Powers storyline. Goldmember was brought into this movie as a backup and his role was not funny at all. The start was brilliant and I thought it was a great idea by getting actors like Tom Cruise, Danny Devito, Kevin Spacey and Gwenyth Paltrow to portray roles of the Austin Powers characters and that must have been the highlight of the movie. Overall I thought that Goldmember was a let down and was the worst one out of all three. Still, The Spy Who Shagged Me remains number 1 and nothing can top that.",Austin Powers in Goldmember

The script was downright uninspired, and with Austin moving to the 70s, his trademark phrases were kept to a minimum. The 70s basically sucked anyway, music-wise, movie-wise, and the only bright spot was the day I was born.

346,garymundy21,Ran out of ideas,3,30 August 2013,"Having recently revisited the Austin Powers franchise, it was abundantly clear within 10 minutes that this 3rd offering was not up to par. In fact, I would go as far as to say this instalment was a mistake by all involved.Here are some reasons that stand out: 1) Poorly recycled jokes from the previous films at nearly every opportunity. I get they were trying to tie them together in an attempt to make it funny, but it just highlighted how they had run out of good ideas.2) The Fat Bastard cameos were neither welcome nor warranted. The character was best left as he was and the attempts to 'humanise' him fell flat. The film did not need him.3) Goldmember was not a good new character.Poorly thought out.4) The 'mole' incident was excruciating and went on too long, and shouldn't have happened multiple times! 5) Mini Me changing sides, and dressing up as Austin was rather annoying.6) They ran out of ideas for Scott Evil and so by making him evil ruined his character. The lasting image of him doing 'the laugh' sums this up.7) The 70'sish scenes were too over the top, even for a film like this, and didn't feel as believable or as fun as the 60's from the first films.8) I know that these films were never meant to be plot driven, but the previous two flowed better and were not just about the gags. This 1 felt like it ditched the story somewhat to focus on an all out assault.9) The 'Just the Two of Us' scene from 'The Spy Who Shagged Me' was fun and surprising, and felt natural. The follow up here of 'Hard Knock Life' was exactly the opposite, considering they were in a prison. It felt forced and was overly annoying.10) Beyonce's character added little to the film beyond adding clichéd 70'sness.11) Michael Caine?! Michael Caine as Austin's dad was pointless and didn't need to be there. His character was completely unnecessary.12) The cameos were far too excessive and only to show off who they could fit into the film. They didn't fit nicely with the film.13) The 'Silence of The Lambs' parody was AWFUL! Rant over! At least I had more fun writing that than I did watching this film.I heard there was talks of a 4th film but this may or may not ever happen. If it did I still have enough respect for the franchise to check it out.

This tripe makes ""There's Something About Mary"" look positively high-brow.Even where jokes are bordering on slightly funny, Myers decides to kill the effect by over-explaining everything. As an example, had they just revealed the full English subtitles, I could have laughed at the scene. But no, they had to have Beyoncé read them out nice and slow, so even the most brainless viewer would get it.In some parts (background signs are an example), the movie tries to imitate a Zucker, Abrahams, Zucker film, but never quite succeeds. Try as it might, an ""Airplane!"" or ""Top Secret!"" it ain't.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
349,Longan,a very funny opening for a very wasted film,4,17 August 2002,"Okay, I must admit I had pretty low expectations for ""Goldmember"". The first movie was very funny, Some of the ideas were very original and few were actually brilliant. The second movie was pretty moderate, It had a few funny scenes but most of it was low-intelligence comedy with alot of childish humor. Okay now to the third one.  unlike my expectations the first few minutes were hilarious and surprising , giving me some hope.unfortunatly the rest went even lower than the worst scenes of the second movie. A lot of physical humor which isn't very funny. Some scenes are even repulsive. Much of the humor is recycled from the former two movies and chewing the same thing for the fifteenth time is boring!. Michael Caine is a great actor and as usual he's doing is job well. Mike Myers is a talented actor and even more talented as a writer, but he should refresh his mind a little and try and write something actually NEW. He was always a fan of physical humor but he should try and make it more funny and less repulsive. To sum it up, you can watch it on video or wait for the cables, the first few minutes worth your time, the rest isn't.Longan",Austin Powers in Goldmember
350,MOVIEBUF-32,See it with a crowd,7,27 July 2002,"Fun time at the movies.  Of course, not the best movie (or the most coherent) but the jokes (many of which are recycled) still hold up, while still giving some time to originality.  The last 20 minutes have to be seen to be believed.  Go with a group, laugh, have fun, don't analyze.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
351,ldowding,Such a shame,2,19 December 2002,I was looking forward to another great Austin Powers film as the first two where a couple of my all time favourites. What I was presented with was a lame attempt at stitiching lots of gags together whilst placing lots of famous people into a film. Mike Myers and co should be a little ashamed (although I'm sure they mad lots of cash). I wouldn't recommend anyone that likes the first films doesn't waste their time watching this.,Austin Powers in Goldmember
352,wludwig,What a disappointment!,4,30 July 2002,I can not recall a more disappointing sequel. The jokes are stale and unfunny. The best part of the original was Austin's anachronism. That aspect is totally gone. This series should be allowed to fade away peacefully.,Austin Powers in Goldmember
353,johnnyonthespot,"As with most series, it's running out of gas",6,26 July 2002,"Well, it's definitely not horrible, that much can be said for it.  And there are definitely about 5-7 truly hysterical parts, which I guess is reason enough to see it.  But there are just as many, if not more, jokes that just fall flat, and often times the characters say unfunny things that are so out of character that they're expected to be funny simply because they're out of character.  Also, don't expect any further witty parodies of the Bond series, other than the title character (who pretty much exists solely as an excuse to give the movie its title).  Most of the humor now comes from a series of celebrity cameo appearances, rips of modern pop-culture, and a rehashing of previous Powers' jokes (and sometimes all three together). About the only truly original funny pieces involve some misinterpretation of subtitles (though even this is dumbed down unneccesarily).  Also, I love Michael Caine, and I think with the right material he can be one of the best comedic actors, but the character he plays has little depth and doesn't give him much to work with, which is a shame.Overall, you won't be wanting the 90 minutes of your life back, and you probably won't want your money back, but you also will probably not be eagerly anticipating a 4th installment.  Myers said before that he'd keep making these as long as people came to see them.  Well, I came to see this one, and I'd probably go see the next one, but I still hope he stops.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
354,Flamingwad,"Jumbled, cheap, exploitative, greedy trash",1,27 July 2002,"Mike Myers is developing something of an Anti-Midas touch. Everything he touches, he cheapens. Jokes, plotlines, respectable actors credibility, everything. The seedy decline of the Austin Powers franchise slides to a disgusting new low in Myer's latest desperate cash in attempt in Austin Powers: Goldmember. I won't ruin it for you, but I feel I owe you the advice...DO NOT SEE THIS FILM. The horror begins with a cheap, insencire cameorgy with uncomfaratable, hurried performances from actors painfully doing Myers a BIG favour. After that...well...coherence kind of crumbles away and yields to a disturbing collage of nonsencial, recycled, disgusting and sometimes frankly rather disturbing idiocy. Dr. Evil isn't funny. Austin Powers has lost all of his appeal entirely. His character has been reduced to a ring announcer in a circus of forced humour. He gleefully displays products for dozens of franchises, awkwardly shouts about the famous actors that have shown up for cameos, and looks generally more like Mike Myers in odd clothing than a fictional character. There was something about the original character as compared to this new, pseudo-self obsessive Michael Myers that made the whole 60s british swinger character original and hilarious. Dr. Evil and Austin Powers were JUST as hilarious. Now we have seen a disgusting degeration of talent. I felt raped by this movie. I felt ripped off, and I think Michael Myers owes me $6. He didn't have the right to do this to me. I can't get back those two hours I spent in front of that product placement laden feces party. The new character, Goldmember, is disgusting, offensive and disturbing. It is Myers trying to force humour from a situation that does not warrant any. Enough said. This is a shudderingly awful travesty of a film, and should never have been made. Take me seriously, it's a waste of your time.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
355,Jolasveinar,This Would Gag a Maggot,2,24 December 2002,"Please wake me when Mike Myers acquires a little integrity and puts this bow-wow of a series to sleep. All the ingenuity that was in the original (and Dr Evil WAS one of the great comic inventions of the decade) has by this sequel to a sequel to a parody dribbled away in a long line of excreta gags. Goldmember's accent is not Dutch; Fat Bastard was never funny; eating flakes of your own skin is not funny; and most movies actually do better when a plot is used. Myers ought to be ashamed but I guess the cash-registers are ringing too loudly for him to hear the little voice in his head saying: ""For love of humanity, stop!""",Austin Powers in Goldmember

I thought it was hilarious in the beginning. (The movie) I won't say anything because it is so freaking funny! *is cracking up just thinking about it* The crude, bathroom humor doesn't stop throughout the movie but I was laughing/cringing/covering my eyes. Fat Bastard is naked. GROSS!!!! Beyonce acts really well as the sexy Foxxy Cleopatra, and Verne Troyer as Mini-Me is hilarious. Goldmember is absolutely hilarious and disgusting. Scott Evil is slowly turning evil. Spoofing You Only Live Twice and Goldfinger mercilessly throughout the movie, it has a totally unbelievable ending that shocked the whole theater. Out of five stars I give it a 3.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
357,deadrising,"A crued, childish mixture of re-gurgitated stupidity",3,8 August 2002,"When I went to see the long awaited Austin Powers 3 I didnt hold my hopes high due to the sequel 'The Spy Who Shagged Me' being miles from its predossessor.  What we get with the movie 'Goldmember' is the same re-hashed humour that seems almost to mock the deformed or different.  The first half hour of this farsy third installment comprises of Miss Beyonce Knowles' pretty damb appalling portrayal of Foxxy Cleopatra whpse character by no means adds to the plot.  Believe me theres no one sexier than Beyonce Knowles but I would keep on singing baby, for you may be a whole lotta woman but I dont rekon a whole lot to your acting skills.Apart from that 25 minutes seems to be comprised of a joke about a mole, which only the demented people at the back even remotely found interesting and well a mole. Thats your lot.Even though the films first 30 minutes werent enough to keep the joker laughing the movies main star  'Mini Me' seems to be the main part of the humour.  Whereas Mike Myers Mindless character 'Goldmember' seems as almost pointless as Beyonce Knowles..but as least shes sexy.Jay Roach should be really dissapointed, in the light of his film 'Meet the Parents' which was the best comedy so far 'Goldmember' seems like another ploy for Jamie Lee Curtis stalker Mike Myers to return and kill us with his 'make more cash, crappy characters.In many ways it seems the movie 'Goldmember' is just a chance for  few actors to mess around and hopefully an audience will fall for the same prosessed humour that was seenback in the original movie.All in all Goldmember is a film that delivers few humourous moments but manages to stimulate one small part of the brain.  With cameos from Tom Cruise and Kevin Spacey its worth the watch, if not just to see foxxy beyonce in one of her sexy outfits!",Austin Powers in Goldmember
358,Nute Gunray,A Very Strong Sequel,8,26 July 2002,"Although the original Austin Powers is still the best of the series, Goldmember is strong as a comedy and it's certainly better than ""The Spy Who Shagged Me."" Mike Myers is one of the most creative comic writers of today and eventhough the jokes are crude, each one is inventive because Myers is having so much fun with his characters and the material. Goldmember is not heavy on plot, but we're not supposed to care if it's story is weak. Audiences should sit back and enjoy all the lunacy and fun, because after all this picture is a treat. Goldmember is a better movie than the second installment because the characters are more interesting this third time around, and I feel as though Myers is not trying too hard to make us laugh as he did with ""The Spy Who Shagged Me."" Myers has so much fun making this series that I'm confident that the fourth picture will be successful as a film.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
359,HughTheHand,"Weakest In The Series,But Still Halirious",8,31 July 2002,"This movie is the worst of all the Austin Powers,but its still pretty good.i wont spoil anything but the beginning is really great.the movie has great and hilarious  cameos.it does get really dumb at some points but theres are times where you can't stop laughing.also if your a Mini Me fan your going to love this movie because he plays such a bigger role.Goldmemeber the character was extremely annoying and i hated him,as I'm sure you will too.but other characters such as the Mole are really funny and Foxy Cleopatra is actually a pretty good character,and very beautiful.if you enjoyed the other Austin Powers than you should really see this one.you won't be disappointed.",Austin Powers in Goldmember

This 3rd movie just didn't seem to have the same vim and vigor the other two did.  Very very funny but just not with the same energy. That opening sequence was a total surprise and hilarious.  Austin/Mike just didn't seem to be having a fun time making the movie.Dr. Evil was as cute as ever though - purrrrrrrr.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
361,Boheme97,"Some funny bits, and mostly it delivers",8,25 May 2005,"I thought that one of the cleverest ways to attack this movie is just what Mike Myers did. He made fun of the fact that he was re-using the same jokes over from the last two Austin films. As in the part where he very randomly starts in on Scott for no reason, and Scott's reaction is ""Oh wait this is very familiar, let me do what I do"". Brilliant. However there are parts in the movie where this concept doesn't carry as well as it does there. The Fat Bastard bits seemed forced, although the wire gag was funny. The shadow puppet bit that was done much better and funnier in the second movie. What saves this movie really from being a re-run is the conflict with Austin's father, and the new villain Goldmember. Michael Caine is excellent and refreshing as Austin's father, although it was almost a little too much drama than I wanted when i pay to see an Austin Powers movie. But Goldmember is spot on. He is hilarious, and the best part about him is he's original! Loved every scene he was in and thought that he was VASTLY underused for having the movie named after him. It was like here's DR. EVIL! DR. EVIL! DR. EVIL! and oh yeah Goldmember, but look over here at DR. EVIL!! Also as a side note I thought that all the good Mini-Me stuff was in the second movie.Quote that I though defined the movie: Ozzy Osbourne saying ""These filmmakers are boobs, they are using the same jokes as they did in the last Austin Powers movie.""My Personal Favorite: ""Dominoes, Mother&#%*!""",Austin Powers in Goldmember
362,andyfrazer,"Not as good as #1 and #2, but still very funny.",7,28 July 2002,"The third installment of the Austin Powers series is not as funny as either of the first two movies, but it's still worth seeing.  Although the writing in this film is weaker than the first two, and some of the jokes seemed like they were waiting for a final rewrite (or a script doctor), there is still plenty of enough really funny scenes to make it worth.
P.S. Make sure you stick around for the brief out-takes and a short extra material during the credits.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
363,sebringer,"A classic.. but please, no more AP",10,9 December 2002,"This is a good film to end the Austin Powers series. Goldmember shines as being the funniest baddie ever, with excellent dialogue and the worst Dutch accent you will ever hear. Michael Caine plays the rogue dad to a tee, but the only let down is Dr. Evil who is cringengly unfunny and has developed a very tedious obsession with Belgium. But overall the sets looks beautiful and all the characters are cute enough in a day-glo, Austin Powers type of way.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
364,Fox1013-3,worst one,5,8 August 2002,"This is definetely the worst installment of Austin Powers. It is funny in many parts, but actually gets boring in others. It is very predictable as well.

365,waylayer,A sparsely funny mess not up to par with the first two installments.,4,31 July 2002,"Wait, isn't the essence of Austin Powers is that it's a spy spoof? I guess not. While The Spy Who Shagged Me still retained a fair amount of spy cliche moments, Goldmember has lost any similarity to the original Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery. In its place are gross-out after gross-out gags, with no sense of timing or cadence to the jokes themselves. A good amount of the jokes themselves are misfires, some are way overdone (the Mole, urine fountain joke), while some just leave you scratching your head (Goldmember himself). Although the opening sequence is funny for the surprises, every other joke that appears was done before in the previous 2 films (curtain screen jokes, fat bastard, Austin/Mini-Me fight, Dr. Evil/Scott Evil interaction, opening dance sequence, music video sequence). Unfortunately, most of these were accomplished more competently in the first 2 installments, and even if they were not, they had the advantage of at least being fresh at the time. Goldmember comes off as just an unoriginal retread and unnecessary sequel that will be seen by many just because it is a ""franchise"", while ignoring the spirit that made the first movie and much of the second enjoyable.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
366,krylonblue,A pretty good movie,10,14 September 2002,"This movie is a must-see if only for the opening skit. The celebrity cameos are hilarious! The rest of the movie was pretty good, although there was an overuse of toilet humour. One thing that annoyed me was the cameo by the Osbournes; do they have to be in everything? I just don't find them funny. Overall, it's a good movie to see if you just want a laugh.
P.S. Look out for references to Toronto and the Maple Leafs.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
367,devil_may_cry_318,The worst of the three,4,21 May 2006,"Mike Myers is back for his third outing as the international man of mystery, Austin Powers. Sadly though, he should have stopped at ""The Spy Who Shagged Me,"" as the introduction of new but boring characters and the rehashing of already used jokes means that this is nowhere near as funny as the previous two.Admittedly, there are still a few laughs to be had out of this, and the movie is in no way terrible. The acting is spot on, and there could have been no better choice than Beyonce to star as Foxxy Cleopatra. Michael Caine is top notch as always, and Verne Troyer probably got the most laughs out of me as Mini Me.However, the inclusion of Goldmember to the characters played by Mike was a big mistake. He was just not funny at all, lacking character throughout, and is easily forgettable. Some of the jokes used were already done in the previous films, and as such were not funny the second time round, for example, the satellite shaped like a pair of breasts scene was already done in The Spy Who Shagged Me.To conclude, Goldmember is still an enjoyable experience, and the inclusion of cameo appearances from the likes of Kevin Spacey and Danny Devito was well put in, just don't expect to get as many laughs out of this as the last two films.",Austin Powers in Goldmember

It was a constant reminder that Hollywood needs some original ideas.Austin Powers:  Oldmember, err I mean Goldmember, is another chapter in the life of Austin Powers.  (Don't worry, there are no spoilers that will jeopardize the movie).Austin has to hunt down some old gezzer named Goldmember, how original.  Dr. Evil and Goldmember are partners because they want to rule the world, blah blah blah, you get the idea.  This movie had so many pop stars I wanted to kill myself; with talent less silicone infested people like Britney Spears, to the dysfunctional, brainless, prince of stuttering Ozzy Osbourne, this movie was crawling with celebrities that shouldn't even be in the film.  I never did understand why all these celebes were in the movie, was Mike Myers trying to take a page from Moby?  or just to say, ""Look, these are my friends.""I'm not going to lie, I was so tired of seeing commercial after commercial of Austin Powers, but when I seen the movie, it wasn't all that's cracked up to be, and now I am REALLY tired of seeing these obsolete commercials of Austin Powers.  Well, on a more softer side to Austin Powers, Myers tried to make Austin out to be the victim when his father was never there for him; aahhh, my black heart bleeds for him; the chemistry between Austin and his father does not click with me, it was so dry of a good relationship.Saying Mike Myers is a comic genius is like saying Fred Durst or Kid Rock are brilliant lyricists, it's just not true.  Austin Powers wasn't funny, the acting was terrible, and the characters had the worst dialogue in the world.  Also, what is with the dancing?

I may be giving an inaccurate account due to the fact I was in the far right first row seats and had a terrible time just sitting there, but I think I'm still somewhat correct. My basic opinion is that the movie was not half as good as the first 2. There wasn't a whole lot of original comedy. Most of the jokes were just jokes about the first 2 movies. In AP1 and 2 I just couldn't stop laughing straight through the movie. This 3rd one I only got a few genuine laughs out of it.

(What else can I say?),3,2 August 2002,"It was Saturday, I was bored, so I decided to live out the British Spy in me and go see Austin Powers, the first two movies of which I found hilarious and superb.I would have had more fun watching a snail cross the road.Honestly people, maybe it was me, maybe I didn't get the jokes...  but when I went to this movie, I was stunned to find myself holding the popcorn bag to my face, waiting for someone to throw Goldmember off a bridge or something.The Good:  The beginning.  Instant gut-implosion time, woot!The Bad:  Is it just me, or did Doctor Evil totally change facial expressions more than ever?  Also very little Frau and Number 2. Pity.The Ugly:  GOLDMEMBER.

374,Hervoyel,"It's over, this series has hit bottom....hard",1,27 July 2002,"I just got back from seeing this one and I have to say this is the first movie this year to completely disappoint me. It's just completely lacking anything to keep you interested. Sure all the people are back and all the jokes are in there that you would expect but it's just not funny this time.Now I expected to see a lot of the same things that were in the first two movies in this series. The Dr. Evil vs Scott game where Scott tries to talk and Dr. Evil tries to make him shut up, The Fat Bastard fixation on bodily functions and excrement jokes, and even the now classic Dr. Evil contacting the ""World Government"" and asking for a ridiculous amount of money to ransom the world were all right where I expected them to be.I'm not annoyed that they repeated all of this and I don't think that's the reason it wasn't funny this time around. I just think that on every one of the running gags they blew it. None of the actors seemed to be trying very hard and in almost every case the timing was off badly.The story is like some sad rip-off of the second one with less thought put into making it. The opening credits are funnier than anything else in the picture which makes for a really long movie.The girl from Destineys Child might be a hell of a singer but she couldn't act her way out of a paper bag. Mike Meyers Austin character seems really forced and he doesn't look like he's having much fun doing it. His Fat Bastard character doesn't do anything amusing and is completely wasted. The lines he has are just gross without any comedy involved. It's almost like Meyers thought FB could just show up and we would laugh. The whole movie feels this way.Goldmember (the character) doesn't even have a previous funny appearance going for him. He's just gross without a point and if possible less funny than everyone else around him.The first one I didn't think much of when I first saw it but it got funnier with time and after running into it a couple of times I could appreciate it for what it was. Obviously Dr. Evil stole the movie. The second one was better because it focused a lot more on the Dr. Evil character and it seemed clear that Meyers had figured out what people enjoyed about the series. This one looks like it was made so a lot of people could collect checks.",Austin Powers in Goldmember

That being said, this movie lived up to my expectations and more. There hasn't been a time where I laughed so hard at the theaters since the South Park movie came out. There were parts of ""Austin Powers in Goldmember"" where I laughed so hard, I was crying. Like other reviewers have been saying, the beginning is hilarious, sure the plot is thin but it's a comedy. My friend was complaining about the how the storyline made no sense, but he did laughed at the movie so apparently Mike Myers and Jay Roach did something right. I base my like or dislike of a movie based on whether or not I'm waiting for it to be over. With Goldmember, I was laughing throughout the entire movie and hoped that it wouldn't end.

377,Code_Green,Austin Powers Does It Again!,8,26 July 2002,"I just saw ""Austin Powers in Goldmember"" so since it's fresh in my mind, I'll make my comment on it. I give it 8 stars out of 10. It was very funny, it had a few references to the '70s, and not so much the '60s like the first two movies. Dr. Evil finally gets captured and it happens just when he's revealing his latest plot which is to go to 1975 to meet Goldmember, who has invented a successful tracking beam. He code names the plan, ""Preparation H"". They will use the tracking beam to bring a meteor to Earth to flood the planet. Soon after, Austin's father Nigel Powers is kidnapped and he finds out from Dr. Evil that he must go back to '75 to find Goldmember, who has Nigel. While there he meets his old flame Foxxy Cleopatra who is a detective. They both go back to 2002 after Goldmember goes to 2002 with Nigel and soon they are involved with Goldmember and Dr. Evil's newest plot. They recycled a few jokes from the first two movies like the joke with Austin being behind a sheet with Felicity and it seemed like she was pulling things out of his ass. They also (once again) recycled the joke where Dr. Evil asks the government for $1,000,000. It was very good. Beyoncè's performance was exceptional and Mike Myers once again succeeded in making a great movie. The cameos were great. Britney Spears, Gwyneth Paltrow, Tom Cruise, Kevin Spacey, Danny DeVito, Katie Couric, the Ozzbournes, the list goes on. The only complaint I have is that they never explained what had happened to Felicity Shagwell. I could understand if maybe Heather Graham didn't want to be in the movie, but still, they could've at least given a brief explanation to what happened to her within the movie. Even so, I highly anticipate seeing this again, and I will definintely get it when it comes to video. Also, I do hope that they make an Austin Powers 4.",Austin Powers in Goldmember

381,ihaveangerissues,The power of adlibbing?,7,30 August 2002,"Austin Powers 3 was a very good movie and it made me laugh quite a bit, but Mike Myers unfortunately was not able to shine with all of his brilliance in this movie. With it's wonderful new jokes, such as Fred Savage playing the mole for the secret agents, and having a grotesque mole above his lip, makes for outrageous humor when characters interact with him.  The film also, successfully, uses almost all the jokes from the previous two installments in this trilogy.  I mean why not?  If it's funny and makes money, do it right?  That seemed to be Hollywood's only plan.Mike Myers was not allowed to do what he does best, and that is adlib.  His sense of humor is apparent in his writing ability, but it really shines when he pulls jokes and gags out of thin air, and that ambiance is what this movie was seriously lacking. Although it was funny, and I recommend seeing it, I do feel that it is not the greatest of the 3, and falls short where the other two stand strong.",Austin Powers in Goldmember

All the old gags are present and they STILL seem to work! Beyonce Knowles is extremely Foxy and the cameos from the likes of Steven Spielberg and Britney Spears are worth every penny. Honestly, watch this film if you love Austin Powers as there is plenty of energy left in the franchise and hopefully enough to keep it going many more years.The only downside to the film is that you can't remember every classic scene and every joke.

384,filmreviewerguy,"No, baby",1,19 May 2011,"A horrible mix of bad acting, unfunny jokes, a plot that makes the Mario Bros. Movie look like Citizen Kane and some of the rudest and most pointless scenes ever. I saw this movie expecting something funny that would spoof the excellent Bond series but what I got was more how I imagine an adult film to be. You wouldn't know it was supposed to spoof James Bond as nothing Bond-like is present. The characters are boring and remarkable but not in a good way. The jokes are corny and are just vulgar. If you haven't already been cursed by its awfulness then skip this movie at all costs.I recommend this movie to someone that enjoys stuffing their face and then going on fairground rides a million times eventually being sick.",Austin Powers in Goldmember

If you don't think highly of the previous Power's efforts, ... then skip this one.  Otherwise, you'll say ""It was worth the price of admission!""  IF nothing else.

Look it's Britney Spears singing her new hit song ""Boys!"")...There were a lot of funny moments, but I felt kind of disappointed...",Austin Powers in Goldmember

It moves at a pace that keeps one awake and interested.  There are a number of jokes that were so humorous I stopped breathing.  The characters, and the actors behind them, all did very well.The Not-So-Good stuff: Again, sometimes the jokes are just repeats.  But, there's nothing wrong with them.  I LOVE AUSTIN POWER JOKES, seeing repeats of the same jokes is great.  There could have been some more ""new"" things, but the reuse of older ideas didn't bother me.That's all the bad things I have to say!In general, this is a very good movie.  I sat in a nicely sized audience, and have never heard people laugh so hard.  Why do some of these other reviewers have to be so harsh to the film?This movie is good.",Austin Powers in Goldmember

The theater was packed and almost every seat was filled.  After the opening scene, everyone in the theater was just dying in their seats.  I was, in fact, also.  ""Goldmember"" is by far the funniest of the 3 Austin Powers movies!  There are some very funny celebrity cameos, but the Osbournes really just need to go away.  The sight gags from the first 2 films are back, and better than ever!  The character Goldmember was very funny, and Fat B*****d is more hilarious in this one, but way more disgusting.  It was also very funny how Austin reacted to the mole on, well The Mole.  And of course Austin and Dr. Evil are very funny.  Don't forget Mini-Me!  Anyone who says this is the worst film of the Austin Powers movies has no sense of humor.  I think a lot of people would agree because everyone in the theater was laughing so hard.  And how could you not like a movie that is making fun of Jay-Z?",Austin Powers in Goldmember
391,mike_number_1,Greatest and Funniest Powers Movie Yet,9,27 July 2002,"The Austin Power's series just keeps getting better and better. Mike Myers is a great writer who knows what it takes to make his movies better and better. Austin and Dr. Evil are even funnier in this movie, and I think Beyonce Knowles as Foxxy Cleopatra is the best ""Powers Girl"" so far. Considering this is her first movie she's appeared in, she did a great job. The one thing I didn't like about the movie was Goldmember. I thought his character was soo stupid, but even still I loved the movie.My favorite character in this movie though would have to be Mini-Me. The role he has in the movie is soo funny.*SPOILER* The best part is when Scott finally starts to become evil, and Dr. Evil begins to neglect Mini-Me. Mini-Me then defects and joins forces with Austin Powers, and thats when the movie really starts to get hilarious. Mini-Me dresses up like Austin and the two try to break into Dr. Evil's submarine, and those two together were just hilarious. *END*All in all this in probably the best Austin Powers yet. And the ending is just great. The cameos (Tom Cruise, Kevin Spacey....) at the beginning of the film were great too. You'll love this one. 10/10",Austin Powers in Goldmember
392,Adrienne517,Potty humor,3,18 October 2002,"Generally, I don't mind silliness if the creator is successful in carrying out his intent, but most of AUSTIN POWERS IN GOLDMEMBER relies on potty humor that takes a great deal of patience to watch after a while.
I liked the cameos with Tom Cruise and Gwyneth Paltrow.  If the movie had continued in the vein they were going, it would have been much more sophisticated.  Mike Myers's versatility in characterization is nothing short of impressive.  His Scottish accent is absolutely amazing; however, you can catch that in SHREK and avoid the scenes in GOLDMEMBER that make you want to vomit.  I'd like to see Myers in some more mature material, à la Blake Edwards.One of the reasons entertainers frequently deign to such crudeness is because this subject material is the type a broader range of his audience will understand.  Now that he has amused those of baser tastes, I challenge Myers to come up with something for his more intelligent fans. Shakespeare proved that you can write to the masses without disgusting others who prefer something more stimulating.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
393,longshanks,Not that good,6,1 August 2002,"I saw Goldmember on opening night last Friday, and I've been trying to figure out since then why I didn't think it was very good.  Sure, there were some funny scenes, such as one that was reminiscent of the tent scene in Austin Powers 2.  That was hilarious.  So was a fight scene between Austin and Mini-Me.  On the whole, however, this movie was basically a dud.  One classic way of knowing it was a letdown:  about half way through the movie, I noticed that I and the people around me were starting to get all squirmy, which is usually a pretty good indication that a movie doesn't have your complete attention.So what was wrong?  It's hard to say.  Partly, I think it took itself too seriously.  I saw some interviews with a couple of the cast members, including Mike Myers, and they all said how much fun they had making this movie.  It doesn't show on screen.  Nobody really seems to be having that good a time.  In fact, the movie almost has a bit a mean streak in it. There also wasn't much chemistry between Myers and Beyonce Knowles, nothing like what Myers had with Elizabeth Hurley in the original, or with Heather Graham in The Spy Who Shagged Me.  It was almost as if Myers was just tired of doing the whole Austin Powers thing, and couldn't bring himself to really get into character, or the movie.  He doesn't even have the trademark bad teeth throughout most of the film.  Maybe playing 4 roles was just too much for him.As far as recommendations go, if you like the second Austin Powers movie better than the first, you might really like this one.  Personally, I thought the original was by far the best one, much more lighthearted and silly, whereas the second one was a little too vulgar for my liking.  If you disagree, then, like I said, maybe you'll really like Goldmember.  It's a tough call.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
394,marc27,bronze medal,6,29 July 2002,"It seems that a lot of the comments are jumping on the popularity bandwagon, Goldmember is sparodically funny, but not a patch on the first 2, goldmember himself is just not funny at all, and the cinema i was in, his lines were met with a stoney silence.

395,patrick_bateman_20,Flogging a dead horse,1,1 August 2002,"Goldmember is an outrageously average film, with poor jokes, poor writing and dreadful product placement. Lets face facts, the Austin Powers movies have been average, they ain't no laugh riot. The great thing about the Spy Who Shagged Me was of course, the introduction of Mini-Me. So what could be funnier, than to have this character be hit, fall over and generally be funny to look at. Beyonce Knowles suffers from a dreadful script in which she utters 'sugar' at every given opportunity to prove that she is from the '70s. Goldmember and Fat Bastard are dreadful characters, and the scenes with the 'mole' are extremely painful to watch. As for Dr. Evil and Powers, same old jokes apply of course. Just seems to me the Mike Myers has run out of ideas, and by adding a new character for him to play as the cameos do not hide that this a poor film. Austin Powers fans will love it i'm sure, but this is franchise too many. I'll be interested where Myers goes after this.",Austin Powers in Goldmember

The jokes fell flat, the plot was too contrived to be cute, and the sight-gags were few and far between. What is onscreen is a mess of skits thrown together to form a not-quite cohesive movie.When walking out of the theater moments ago, my friends and I admitted that there were a few moments that were funny.

399,wink12345,Mike Myers is not a comic genius.,4,3 August 2002,"After seeing the first two Austin Powers movies which I found funny, I decided to see the third one expecting the same hilarious laughs that I had in watching the previous film The Spy Who Shagged Me. Austin Powers in Goldmember does have some funny moments but a lot of scenes are just recycled jokes from the first two.  The thing that bugged me the most about this film was how Mike Myers resorted to being more and more gross just to get laughs (ie. any scene with Fat Bastard).  He seems to think that bodily fluids and functions are the most hilarious things on earth. He is funny in scenes but is no comic genius like a lot of people are calling him. Another thing that bothered me was a long setup for one line involving ""Mr.Roboto"". It was not funny and I knew it was coming as soon as I heard the word Roboto.  The bottom line is that Mike Myers can be funny even if most of his humour does involve bodily functions (The Spy Who Shagged Me). But in this film he goes too far and uses too many stale jokes. I give it two stars out of five.",Austin Powers in Goldmember

The jokes are awkward, the plot cliche and just very haphazard. The dialogue is filled with the usual tired risque humor that we have all come to know and love from the Austin Powers persona, but here, they seemed to deliberately act as ridiculous as possible, rehashing old plot threads and playing around with the familiar characters that we've laughed at from the start. In a nutshell, Goldmember is awkward, poorly written and stupendously unfunny.",Austin Powers in Goldmember

I'm not a big Beyoncé fan and doubted her acting abilities.  She was fair, and Mike Myers was at his best.  The cameos were great.  This is most certainly the best one yet.  It even has a surprise ending.  The best part was when they showed them as young students and Evan Farmer was there as young Number 2.

403,lolxors,Overrated repeat,6,27 July 2002,"I really didn't know what to expect from this 3rd installment of the Austin Powers franchise. I did expect the line on opening night to be extremely long. Thankfully the wait time I spent was only 1 hr and twenty minutes because I would have killed myself otherwise. I really savored the opening credits for it is something that was completely unexpected. After the opening I had carried over high hopes that the movie be better than watching clothes spin in a dryer...I lost my anticipation as soon as I saw the same ""shh"" joke from the previous two Austins. Even though most of the jokes were recycled, there were a few scenes that made me open up and blast my drink downward. The storyline seemed to have come from one of those websites that every loser in the world can add a line to the story, twists and stupidity ensues surprises and bad accents. If you liked Austin before, you might like this movie as the trilogy completes, but if you never did like the series, do not waste your time/money on this overrated repeat. Just remember, you don't have to leave the theater right away, go to another one to get your money's worth, since Goldmember is not worth the eight dollars you paid.

It's one of the funniest moments in the movie and I'd like to preserve that for you.""Goldmember"" is just as funny if not funnier than ""The Spy Who Shagged Me"" mainly because it slaps you with jokes at unexpected moments as well as the expected ones!  The jokes don't let you down and I guarantee you will laugh. What is a little shabby though is the story line.

Sure, there are laughs for those of us who love the silliness of it, but it was totally disconnected.  Mike Myers was as always funny as Austin, with Beyonce Knowles turning in a surprisingly good performance as Foxxy Cleopatra.  Love Michael Caine, but they should have given him more to do and Fat you-know-who less.  Getting a little tired of Mini-Me, too.  Oh well, it's brain candy, what do you expect?

407,philcrandon,The beginning and middle were funny but the ending SUCKED (WARNING: MAJOR SPOILERS),6,2 August 2002,"Although not a true fan, I enjoy the Austin Powers series and looked forward to the release of the third sequel. First, I must say that at first Beyoncé Knowles seemed to be out of place but as the movie went on she seemed fit in pretty well but was quite different than Elizabeth Hurley or Heather Graham were to the other Austin Powers movies. Although there wasn't much of a plotline (Dr. Evil hatched a plot to destroy the world but it wasn't as prominent as in the other two movies), there were plenty of jokes true to the storyline as well as entertaining action.Until the end, that is, where there was a huge plot twist that absolutely ruined the Austin Powers franchise.WARNING: LOTS OF SPOILERS AHEAD...SKIP THIS IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE!I have to say that the cameos in the beginning were absolutely hilarious, with my favorite being Danny DeVito as Mini-Me. The middle wasn't quite as funny, but it still has its entertaining moments. The Fat Bastard sumo wrestling scene, the Godzilla ""copyright , infringement"" scene, and Mini-Me's remarks to Foxy Cleopatra about ""having a little clone inside herself"" were some of my favorites. The one thing that really annoys me is that they made a big deal of going back in time to 1975 but were there for what, five minutes?Now for the end: As Scott Evil loses his trademark character and becomes ""Evil"", Nigel Powers (Austin Powers's father) reveals that he is Dr. Evil's father as well and they all come together in one big happy family...so Austin Powers and Dr. Evil (not to mention his entire organization) are friends. Aside from the fact that this was not funny at all, it also left very little room for a future installment (which I would have liked). Are the producers and writers trying to kill the franchise? What's next, Austin against Scott Evil? That would be awful.On a side note, Goldmember seemed to be a pointless addition.Overall, I would give Austin Powers in Goldmember a 6.5 out of 10. The first (Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery) was my favorite with The Spy who Shagged Me second and Goldmember third.",Austin Powers in Goldmember

412,Matthew-Barison,Don't give up on the series.,7,14 August 2002,"Throwing in the towel is exactly what I was planning to do after seeing The Spy Who Shagged Me.  However, Goldmember was really amusing.  I don't need to get into all the characters (you don't really want to read about them,) but I will tell you that the abundance of Myers' is very well done and the developing connections between all the characters is quite fun to follow. Scott remains the wildcard, and although this movie by no means resolves the Powers/Evil dynamic, it seems to me that this angle will play itself out like Steve McGarrett v. Wo Fat in Hawaii 5-0.Although this is essentially a goofy spy movie, the spy plot is totally unimportant.  If you like Tom Clancy or a good Harrison Ford thriller, you won't enjoy this movie.  The true action is on the level of the relationships and feelings these characters hold for each other; I know that may sound crazy, but I found it thoroughly intriguing.  As an earlier poster noted, this move is DEFINITELY for the OUT crowd - you'll read it on another level.  I will note that my straight counterparts enjoyed this film and it will definitely appeal to anyone in the mood for a funny and strangely touching film.",Austin Powers in Goldmember

416,Movie_Groover4Eva,What has happened to Austin Powers?,1,23 September 2002,"When I was about to see this movie, I was thinking,'Something tells me this movie isn't going to be that great'. I thought it couldn't beat the very hilarious second Austin movie. But I just thought I should see it and see what it is like in case I was wrong. But it turns out I was right! 'Austin Powers In Goldmember' was the worst Austin Powers so far. I hope the supposed 4th movie that is coming out in a few years time is MUCH better.There were a few funny jokes such as Fat Bastard singing on the toilet and the funny text on the bottom of the screen during the conversation with Mr. Roboto the Japanese guy. But the characters had no meaning! Austin was hardly a sex symbol in this 3rd installment (he was a 'sexy beast' in the other two films), and Mini me turned to Austin's side and Scott turned evil! They lost the characters completly. I could on for ages about the characters stupid transformations. They even had hardly any 70's music where as in the first 2 flicks, they had great music for the era known as the 60's. But I gotta admit...the celebrity appearances were quite good.
I ain't knocking Mike Myers. He is excellent and even Beyonce Knowles who plays Foxxy Cleopatra was pretty good at acting but I didn't think much of the movie at all. They made huge mistakes. They even deleted Heather Graham's appearance as Felicity Shagwell, Austin's second leading lady from the second film.To those who haven't seen the previous Austin flicks, and are about to see the 3rd please.......See the 'Spy Who Shagged Me' first, as that is the FUNNIEST of all Austin Powers flicks.Very disappointing...............",Austin Powers in Goldmember
417,rainmaker_au,What a disappointment: 3/10,3,13 October 2002,"As a fan of the first two Austin Powers films, I was eagerly awaiting the release of Goldmember.  After seeing the film however, I am very disappointed.The movie, to me, seemed very 'incoherent'.  The plot did not seem to run as smoothly as the last two.  It seemed to be just thrown together haphazardly. It is although the producers thought ""oh oh, what was funny from the last one?  ok, that bit was, we'll put that there... and this bit there... and we'll slightly change that bit and put it there... and we'll add a couple of new things here and there.""  And that about sums up the movie: tired old worn-out gags and jokes, and a couple of new things for a chuckle or two.The 'plot' itself, if you can really call it a plot, was introduced incredibly fast, with no real reasoning or explanation.  I guess it's a case of ""yes, we're the bad guys, and we're going to destroy the world"" once again, but at least in the last two movies they actually seemed to mean it. In this one, it was as though Dr. Evil and Co. weren't even trying.The best part of the whole movie, in my opinion, was the opening sequence. Very funny and very witty - pity the rest of the movie didn't follow suit. If you do see this movie, see it for the first five or ten minutes, then walk out or switch it off.Goldmember himself as a character was just... very, very odd.  I don't know that many Dutch people, but I'm sure the producers have never met one in their life judging from their ""typically Dutch"" Goldmember.  He didn't really do anything dramatic throughout the whole movie until the very end, and seeing how the film's title was ""Goldmember"", you'd expect him to feature just a little more than he did.Other flaws I noticed include:*  What happened to Heather Graham's character after the last movie?  Has she just vanished?  I have heard she was supposed to get a cameo but they cut it.*  Where was Mustafa?  With all the re-used bits from the past two movies, surely they could have thrown him in there too for a couple of chuckles.*  I didn't mind Austin's Dad being there so much, but something I learned a long time ago is that when family members of main characters in a TV series or in films start being introduced, it's usually a sign that the TV or film series is dying.  If this movie is anything to go by, I'd say that Austin Powers' days are extremely numbered.* A certain play-on-words joke failed in Australia because we don't have a product on our shelves with the same name... the audience worked it out after a little while, but it didn't have the desired effect... they need to be more careful with word gags like that... with the last two movies they picked things that were more well known.Finally, perhaps the biggest flaw of all: AUSTIN DIDN'T GET A SHAG!  The poor old chap!  Third movie and he's over the hill, eh?  He had the incredibly attractive Foxy Cleopatra at his side throughout the entire movie, and not once did he jump on a revolving bed and say ""DO I MAKE YOU HORNY, BABY?  DO I MAKE YOU RANDY?""  Not once!  Oh well Austin, time to hang a certain Swedish ""adult product""... looks like you won't be needing that anymore.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
418,jonathansumner,fairly good action comedy yet somewhat slow,7,16 June 2009,"I recently watched Austin Powers in Goldmember after waiting for months to be able to see it fully. I had heard positive comments about the film. I found it to be fairly entertaining with some good action sequences, but it also had a lot of weak parts which were boring and slow.If you want to see the film without knowing what takes place in the storyline then it is best to stop reading my review and go buy it and watch it, because my review HAS SPOILERS. However, if you want to know a little more about what takes in the film before you see it, then continue reading my review.The opening action sequence when Austin parachutes into a car was decent but not as exciting as the action sequences in movies like Terminator 3, X2 Xmen United, The Bourne Ultimatum, Live Free or Die Hard, or XXX state of the Union, but it is important to remember that this is an action comedy as well as a James Bond Parody but not an action thriller. I am now going to state to you in two separate paragraphs what I liked and what I didn't like as much.Some of the enjoyable scenes include the sumo fight where Fat Bastard sends his opponent flying in the air, the fight in the changing room where Austin fights with Fat Bastard, the meeting with Mr Roboto, the scene where Austin is urinating, the part where Austin and Foxy infiltrate the factory and rescue Nigel, the car chase through Tokyo,the roller disco club, the part where Nigel comes to the submarine layer, the scene where Austin and Foxy escape Goldmember's club with the girls shooting at them, the part when Austin and Mini Me are behind a screen door, and last but not least the part when Dr Evil and the prisoners sing ""Hard Knock Life."" Now it might sound like I enjoyed everything in the film but that is not true. There were many scenes that made the film feel bland and simple. Some of those scenes include the knighting ceremony, the scene where Austin visits Dr Evil in jail, the flashback at the academy, and the scene when Dr Evil realizes he is Austin's brother, and he turns good. These were some of the weak aspects of the film. Another problem with this movie was that some scenes had too much dialogue but not enough action. But some of it is funny, like Fahza and mole for instance.But I think everyone should watch Goldmember at least twice especially Austin Powers fans who enjoyed the first two movies.Wheather this film is worth owning depends on you. If you are a movie buff like me who loves non stop action blockbuster then it might not be the film that belongs in your collection but that is up to you. If you are an Austin fan who likes comedy movies and is a fan of the sixties spy films, then this would be a perfect film to include in your DVD collection. This would also be a good film to own if you are a person like me who wants to own a lot of DVDs.Overall, this was a good film to see. It was something different from the other films I see and had an equal share of good scenes as it did of bad scenes. Yes some parts of the movie are slow but that is because this is a James Bond parody and many of the Bond films were slow at times.I would like to end my review by saying that the best way to decide if this is a movie for you is by watching it.Good Luck and Have Fun",Austin Powers in Goldmember
419,johnboz69,Just awful,1,19 July 2003,"The first Austin Powers movie was brilliant, the second one dragged quite a lot (perhaps half as good) and this one is just awful. Beyoncé Knowles is the only reason to watch it and even she can't make it enjoyable. Please, no more, or at least not unless Myers can get away from the toilet humour. It's just not funny. 1 out of 10.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
420,Austin_Powers_fan,"A little too dirty, but still great.",9,13 October 2003,"Although I really liked this movie I didn't like the new character, Goldmember. I also thought it was a little too dirty for me. They could have done without the twins and made Mini Me a little less nasty. As you can tell by my sign-in name I love all three Austin Powers movies, but they're a lot funnier when they don't go too far with the dirty jokes. Still, Goldmember is a another hilariously funny Austin Powers movie!",Austin Powers in Goldmember

This time it is Goldmember.In this film, there is less Fat Bastard (a good thing) and a new character , Goldmember, who is just genius. If you have the DVD check out the extra scenes, they are hilarious.Goldmember's quotes are superb, ""Dutch Hater"", ""kc and the sunshine band"", ""ooh thats a keeper.""The plot is a bit ropey, but as this franchise is all about set pieces. and it works. 9 out of 10 times the comedy works, and 9 out of ten is what I give it.And for those who are interested.....1.

422,hereandnow1,freakin hilarious,10,19 April 2005,"I can't say enough about this movie. it has all the elements of a great comedy. in-jokes,sarcasm,pop culture references,laugh out loud moments and the dialog is the best in the series and in any comedy in a long time. mike myers is a comic genius and should be given more credit for the work he does here. the series is in its third installment and myers is more than comfortable in all the different characters skin's. he even adds goldmember to the list. the casting in these movies is perfect as well. Micheal cane as nigel powers was pure genius and keeping all the originals around was great(major props have to be given to seth green,robert wagner and mindy sterling) they play off myers perfectly and it wouldn't have been the same movie without them support mr powers...i mean...mr myers;) the only complaint i have with the movie is beyonce as the new powers girl. she does do the part well but she is just so dam annoying, but she stays out of the way enough not to make it a big detriment on the film as a whole. i just can't say enough about this movie. its one of those movies you can laugh at over and over again and even find something new that you missed the first dozen times you watch it. i suggest if you haven't seen this movie go out and rent it NOW!..and watch it at least twice cause you'll miss some really good plans...err....dialog from laughing so much.my rating is 10/10 a perfect comedy",Austin Powers in Goldmember
423,Catch22,"A few good laughs, but it tries too hard",6,29 July 2002,"It's not bad, but not great either.  There are some good laughs, a couple of REALLY good laughs and a lot of re-hashed jokes from the first two movies.There's a lot more scatological humor in this one, gross-out gags and the like.  The plot is the weakest in the series...in fact it seems that the plot is only used as a tool to introduce (and re-introduce) jokes.  There's never a real sense that the evil plot is really playing out, and the climax and conclusion are downright silly.As much as I enjoyed the first two movies, I was more than a bit let down by Goldmember.  It's got its moments, but overall it shows us that this franchise has reached the end of it's life.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
424,frankie-4,Pretty funny,8,26 July 2002,"I thought the ending was a tad lame, but on the whole the movie was pretty darn funny. The opening credits are great (especially what happens to Brittany Spears.... we could only hope...). There are some scenes that are absolutely side splitting (one involves Mini-Me and Austin behind a screen.... you have to see it). I was disappointed in the character Goldmember. I didn't find him all that funny. There are some variations on some jokes being repeated from the prior two movies (as Ozzy points out quite comically) but there are plenty of new laughs as well. I rate this one 8/10.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
425,TheQL,can Austin get any better,10,18 October 2002,"I just watched the movie and thought I would laugh myself to death! Anybody who liked the first two movies will love this one as well and it is far underrated until now (6.7 avg.). Go and see and return to vote. I understand this is not the movie for everybody, but hey, you shouldn't watch it if you don't like Mike Myers. It's as simple as that.Now enjoy!",Austin Powers in Goldmember
426,ericv,Funny,8,2 August 2002,"I though the movie had some funny moments and some jokes that didn't work. Reference a previous comment, have you even seen the movie? If so, why? Obviously you are familiar with the Austin Powers series and you know what it's all about, ie the bathroom humor. Assuming you've even watched the movie, why did you waste your 90 minutes knowing full well it would be more of the same? Given that which are you, a dummy, a feminist or one of the brainwashed masses?",Austin Powers in Goldmember
427,deal,Crikey! Austin's Lost His Mojo!,5,27 July 2002,"As a big fan of the first two Austin Powers movies, I was extremely disappointed in this one.  After an incredibly hilarious first ten minutes, everything falls apart.  The jokes are lame retreads from the previous films, and the story is abysmal, with an ending that makes no sense and will make you cringe.The new characters (Foxxy, Goldmember) are ok, but are nowhere near as funny or clever as the new characters introduced in the Spy Who Shagged Me (Mini-Me, Fat Bastard).  Indeed, Goldmember and Foxxy aren't given much screen time at all, are given almost nothing to do.Through the whole film, whenever it feels as though the jokes are about to get funny, things just fall flat.  After the opening (which is brilliant), the movie just never gets on track.  In the theater I was in, you could tell the audience really wanted to laugh... but was never really given much to laugh about.I hate to say it, but it looks like the Austin Powers franchise has lost its mojo.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
428,jeremy_norbury,Plot? Surely you're missing the point!,7,26 July 2002,"""Sneak Preview"" 9.25pm Manhattan Beach, CA 25th July 2002.Some minor spoilers (more like ""don't miss this""), nothing significant IMNSHO.I certainly was not disappointed, but you shouldn't expect a very detailed plot here. There are several ""laugh out loud"" scenes with quite a lot of visual gags - which will probably appeal more to the male half of the audience (it did in the cinema I saw it in). Myers added a new character and brought out all the old characters in this piece. The new bad-guy, ""Goldmember"", is Dutch with a thick Dutch accent. Living in Amsterdam, I particularly appreciated this. Dr Evil was in very good form and Mini-Me was well used. Sadly, I felt that the Austin character was actually the weakest of the bunch in this episode, with Myers being somewhat inconsistent with Austin's accent and the character being less flamboyant than I expected. Mole!English (British) audiences will appreciate the Cocky-rhyming-slang scene, which is subtitled for ""foreigners"". The older among you should look out for the ""I thank you!"" - a little Eric Morecambe phrase used by both Myers and Caine.Nice cameo appearances from several very well known celebrities - Nathan Lane has a nice part and John Travolta shows up unexpectedly.The credits have some nice out-takes.Trivia (may be considered a spoiler):Some trivia - Burt Bacharach (and Hal David) wrote ""What's it all about, Alfie"" for the film ""Alfie"", starring Michael Caine. Scenes from Alfie are used to depict Michael Caine as a young man in a flashback scene. Burt Bacharach performs in the movie and the final song is ""What's it all about, Austin"", sung (I think) by Britney Spears - who's also in the movie. Nice and not wasted on me.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
429,lindemans,Worst of the series!,2,21 November 2002,"I liked the first one. I absolutely loved the second one, and I expected that this one was going to be the best of the series. Well, it wasn't. They movie just isn't funny enough. Sure, there are some great gags, especially the opening sequence, but on the whole it's a major let-down. No coherent story line and no plot. Waste of time.Mike Myers has lost his mojo. I give at 2/10.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
430,snjmorrow,"Alot of the same jokes, but funny as ever.",6,30 July 2002,"If you loved the first 2 Austin Powers movies, this one won't disappoint you.  Yeah, Mike Meyers recycles some old jokes, but they are just as funny today.  Not as disgusting as AP2, Goldmember delivers solid hilarity (I think I only wanted to puke once [the 'Flaking' Dutchman] yeah baby!). The cameos in Goldmember alone are worth the price of admission.Don't miss this one!",Austin Powers in Goldmember
431,mmussel,Tired humor,4,5 August 2002,"Did this movie make me laugh? Occasionally, I'll admit, but not as much as I would have liked.Maybe I'm missing the point of the Austin Powers movies in general, but even the first one seemed like it was a conglomeration of old, used jokes. Even the spy movie satire elements were nothing that other movies hadn't poked fun at dozens of times before.When the first sequel appeared a couple of years back, a few of the jokes still had enough life left in them to repeat one last time, but now that Goldmember is here, I assure you, all remaining humor has long since been wrung out of them.If you want to see yet another try at the sugegstive shadow scene, the fembots (this time with a celebrity cameo in a desparate attempt to make them funny again), more clone jokes, and even more of the father/son conflict than you saw before, then by all means, feel free to go for another helping, and don't let my criticism stop you, but don't blame me if you feel like you've seen it all before.",Austin Powers in Goldmember

433,Clanallan,"Dry and tired, though the shagging's not...",7,30 July 2002,"It may be safe to say that any of the Mike Myers' Austin Powers films are sure to make you laugh, as all of them have for me.  Maybe that is why we all rushed out to see the third installment, Austin Powers in Goldmember, out of commitment and curiosity.  However, a part of me says you can still watch the first two and get the same banter you will from the third one. Don't get me wrong, there is plenty original material in Goldmember, some really funny jokes and the ever popular Dr.Evil - MiniMe Duet, but the series grows tired, and even dry.  I already knew Austin Powers can dance to make girls heads explode, I knew Dr. Evil likes to ask for obnoxious sums of money, and I knew Fat Bastard is slightly uncouth. These things are repeated, not subliminally, but instead there to smack you in the face. Ok fine, touch base with the preceding films. Now on to good stuff, the new stuff. There were some scenes alone that definitely made this film worth seeing, and worth laughing. One being the urine sample scene, conspicuously as silhouettes on a curtain, and the subtitles scene.  New additions such as the gaseous Evil Submarine and the energetic Beyonce Knowles refresh the film, reminding the audience of Myers' creativeness. If you're a Powers fan, you've already seen the movie, if you're teetering on the edge, make sure you haven't seen the first two movies in a while.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
434,hazzah1,Just as funny in a diffrent sort of way,3,28 July 2002,"Goldmember is hilarious.  That's the one word review.  The beauty of all the Austin Power's movies is that they're all movies that you have to watch about three or four times just to catch all of the jokes or double entendres.  Even if you do watch them that often, you still, most likely missed something.Watching this movie, especially the opening credits sequence and the prologue, you seem to think back to the other two films and remark to yourself: ""Wow, the budgets and special effects have gotten a lot better!"" then, you get that warm fuzzy feeling inside as if you've seen your kids grow up and you get more and more proud of what they've done.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
435,droolboy14,terrible,1,5 December 2002,"This is the biggest disgrace. The first two were hilarious, but this had a terrible plot. I cannot stress how bad it was. All they did was repeat jokes that were only funny the first two times. The characters were so dumb, and why did they totally destroy every possible plot element they had. Mini me became good, Dr. Evil was austin powers' brother, Scott replaced mini me and went bald? Goldmember???? I'm confused. This movie suÂ¢ked......",Austin Powers in Goldmember

The ending is one of those that wraps everything up, but then again, leaves the possibility for more sequels.Michael Caine is excellent as Austin's father. Seeing that the teeth run in the family is amusing. The opening of the movie gets one of the biggest laughs. Cameo is the name of the game.I was disappointed that there was no Will Ferrell in this sequel, and there was no end-of-the-credits joke.

The 'Convoy' piss take is great (Convoy is my My favourite movie).The goldmember character is not funny, Nigel Powers (Michael Caine) just seems out of place.  Dr Evil and Mini Me are funny as always.5.5 out of 10I heard somebody come out of the cinema to say it was better than the first two, I would say it was not.",Austin Powers in Goldmember

The jokes in the movie were funny but they were the same as the first two movies so it just got old. Austin Powers #1 and #2 are far better than this film mainly because it didnt repeat the same jokes as much. All in all, Mike Meyers is still my hero, but they need to drop the whole Goldmember segment because it was not funny at all.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
441,robertprince,"Low brow for sure, but we hardly stopped laughing",7,26 July 2002,"I see that Austin Powers is getting very mixed reviews, both from the pros and IMDB users, and be assured that it will not be joining Some Like It Hot and Tootsie as one of the funniest and intelligent movies of all time. Perhaps it suffers a bit from a wee too much scatology.  And the plot is the barest wisp of a framework to hold the movie together.  It's really just a series of gags and sketches.Nevertheless, I recommend this movie for the simplest of reasons: The audience I saw this with, including me, hardly stopped laughing throughout. A few of the gags are so gross they'll make you wince, and a few are carryovers from the first two Austin Powers films, but on the whole the movie is one funny, creative bit after another. And the many surprise cameos are a hoot.Kudos too for Beyoncé Knowles for a funny and charming turn as Foxy Cleopatra.  While not the most complex female lead in film history, she fills the limited demands of the role nicely.These days, a film that does nothing more than keep me laughing for an hour and a half will get my vote every time.8 out of 10",Austin Powers in Goldmember
442,hallerik,Awful and Unoriginal,1,28 September 2002,"After the introduction, this movie was unoriginal. Mike Myers just used the same jokes that had made the two previous movies successful by putting them into this awful third edition of a franchise that started out so well.

443,hollingsworth76,Don't let anyone ruin the first 5 minutes!,7,28 July 2002,"Goldmember is a perfect accent to the first two films.  It revisits old material without driving it into the ground and adds new touches without taking the series in a new direction. Myers is, as usual, above perfection in his performance.  Dr. Evil continues to be the best of the characters and provides a hysterical lyrical turn that must be seen to be believed. The film wraps up in a respectable place where it can be equally viable as the last Austin movie or provide a turning point if the series continues. Once again a genius comic spoof that is made even more enjoyable for fans of the James Bond series who catch all the in jokes along the way.",Austin Powers in Goldmember

The opening alone made my husband and I laugh so hard that tears were rolling down our cheeks.  The use of the cameos made the film even more hilarious.The only drawback to Mike Myers' characters was ""Goldmember"".  He was not what I had hoped for in that his part was not as humorous as those of his other characters.  I did, however, enjoy the other characters that Mike Myers played.The movie was a laugh a minute and the audience that was there when I saw it were rolling on the floor laughing.Thanks, Mike Myers, for such an entertaining film!",Austin Powers in Goldmember
445,tocker,Poor effort,3,4 August 2002,"I was looking forward to seeing this so much, I had read reviews that raved about it. I had seen the last two (many, many times) and loved them to bits. But I came out very disappointed.It looked like a film that was made for the sake of making a film. Ok, so I did laugh, there are a few good moments but ""on the whole"" I was cringing for large chunks of this film. Too much of it was poorly thought out humour, where the jokes were obvious and just not funny.The set of characters for this film were poor. Foxy Cleopatra??? She might as well not have been in that film at all, why was she anyway? Terrible, how many times did she say the same thing? Number 2? Why was he there?, underused. Frau (Not going to attempt to spell her name, you know who!) was underused too. Micheal Caine's character was terrible and he got landed with two of the worst jokes in this film. I was glad to see Fat Bastard back, because I liked him, but, like most of this film, his appearance was all a bit pointless. In a film that never really goes anywhere.It all ended up being complete nonsense and the already weak storyline fell to pieces. I doubt there will be a 4th, I think Ive just witnessed the sad ending of another good series of films.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
446,Bazzie,"Dirty, but still very groovy, baby!",10,27 July 2002,"This movie was everything I thought it would be, and then some. In my opinion (and I'm sure there are people who will disagree with me), this was the best Austin Powers flick yet. They reused a lot of jokes from the first two, but where as you thought they would be stale, they twisted them into a whole new light. I had stitches in my side during the Osbournes scene(I won't give anything away).Going into the movie, I wasn't quite sure what the tagline meant by ""The Secret will Be Exposed"". Coming out of the movie, I realized that the BIG secret at the end made almost everything come full circle.But other than that, the ending really set up for a sequel. I really enjoyed this film, and I should hope to see Austin Powers 4 in the years to come.",Austin Powers in Goldmember

I was sitting there thinking, ""Oh yeah, they pulled out all the stops for this one."" Unfortunately they apparently felt so confident in this film that they let a 6th grader finish writing the rest of the film during lunch period. After the first 15 minutes this film turns to witless toilet humor so un-funny you'll wish Gallagher would show up and smash something.

It is merely a continuation of jokes presented in International Man of Mystery and The Spy Who Shagged Me, never standing on its own. The first two were genually humorus films, but Goldmember pushes no new ground and there is really only about 5 minutes of funny moments.Liked it?

450,sportsfreak2125,HOLY MOLEY!!!!!,9,29 July 2002,"This movie ROCKS!!!!  From the opening (which was clever), to the unveiling of the ""secret"" at the end, this movie brings down the house with its unique brand of comedy.  The audience was laughing throughout!!! (I almost squirted my soda out of my nose at the Preperation H joke!)Mike Myers takes on quadruple duty in this one, playing Austin, Dr. Evil, Goldmember, and Fat Bastard (whose presence in this movie wasn't THAT important).  To my knowledge, only Eddie Murphy has played more roles in a comedy portraying the entire Klump family.  Anyway, Myers is AMAZING to say the least.  He does a fantastic job playing the good guys, the bad guys, and even the fat guys.Beyonce Knowls did an Ok job as Foxy Cleopatra, but her chareacter didn't get as much screen time as I thought she would.  Oh well, she still had her moments.Verne Troyer returns as Mini-me in this film, and Mini-me is still well... Mini-me.  Intresting to note that Troyer does all of his own stunts.  I would never do half the things he did in this movie, and I'm 6'1""!!!Of course, all of the other henchmen for Dr. Evil returns as well. Unfortunatly for Robert Wagner (Number 2) and Mindy Sterling (Frau Farbissina) they get less exposure than in previous installments. (I think that would be a good thing for Sterling.  All that yelling...)Seth Green also returns as Scott Evil.  I like Scott because he says what's on my mind whenever I hear a bad Dr. Evil joke. (Remember Operation Wang Chung from the second movie?  Classic).As for celebrities, watch for cameos from Brittney Spears, Quincy Jones, Tom Cruise, Danny Devito, Steven Speilburg, John Travolta, and the Osbournes among others.  Man, last time I saw so many stars, I was looking through a telescope!!!Also funny in this movie is the recuring jokes, one of which is in this review.  All in all, Goldmember is the best Austin Powers movie yet.  I'm only imagining what they will do for the sequel (although with all the sudden twists in the movie, it will be hard to figure out what the heck they will do next).Oh and one more thing, WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO FELICITY SHAGWELL?!?!?!",Austin Powers in Goldmember

I felt a little da-va-ju with all the repeated jokes. I don't think anybody really liked Goldmember. He was just plain , nobody laugh a his jokes when I was sitting in the theater. They certainly could have gotting some one that could act to play the part of Mrs. Foxy Cleopatra. One moment in the movie really made me sick, when that damn Britney Spears showed her face. Do get me wrong I love her face , along with other things , but it ruined the movie for me. Spears was the only cameo they would have been better off leaving out. Overall I gave it a 5/10.",Austin Powers in Goldmember

As is pointed out, the gags seem to be recycled but placed in a different order. Goldmember is a very poor and underdeveloped character. He is a two joke character that is not enough to base a movie on. Michael Caine is.... Michael Caine (pass the cheque and I'll show up). The best part is the opening sequence and a scene set in a Japanese mogul's office. Even my sister, who is a great Austin fan, was not impressed with this. Definitely a spoof to far.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
455,sirdiddimus,Goldmember = Not So Good,3,23 July 2002,"All of the early reviews I read for GOLDMEMBER were positive, so I was psyched about going to a special WNFZ radio station sponsored sneak preview of the latest installment of AUSTIN POWERS.  Then I saw it.  *sigh*  It was really, really not as good as THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME.  Okay, granted, there were about six (maybe seven) really good laughs.  They were just few and far between.I know it seems rather shallow to base an opinion of a movie on how many times you laugh, but with the AUSTIN POWERS franchise, you have to. Besides, IT'S A COMEDY!  Think of THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME.  You didn't watch it for the incredible plot development.  (And if you did, I'm really, really sorry.)  You saw it to laugh.  And I did.  I laughed so hard my sides hurt when I left.But this time around, we've seen all of these jokes before.  The musical numbers.  The ""That looks like a giant--[penis reference].""  They're just kind of hackneyed.  I wanted something new.  The second AUSTIN POWERS had more laughs because it took the humor in different (although more disgusting) directions.  It's like Mike Myers just took his last script, changed some wording, and threw it into the Hollywood movie-making machine.I will give the movie this: the opener is great.  The cameos are hysterical. Then you get in to the rest of the movie, and it's like The M & M Show (Mike Myers--get it?).  Also, it's sloppy.  And that's where the laughs fall flat.  They're not even trying anymore.  It feels like Mike Myers is too aware of his ability to create humor.  He mugs at the camera as if to say, ""It doesn't matter what I do--you WILL laugh.""  Well, I defy you, Mike Myers!!!  I just can't laugh in the presence of comic arrogance.  Unless it's my own.",Austin Powers in Goldmember

New jokes, new characters and a great scene at the beginning featuring a movie that steven speilberg is making about ""Austin Powers"" called ""Austinpussy"", starring Tom Cruise as Austin, Gwenyth Paltrow as Dixy normas, Kevin spacey as Dr. Evil and even funnier.... Danny devito as Mini Me.As far as the plotline goes.... Austins dad has been kidnapped by ""Goldmember"" (again played by Myers) and Austin has to use Dr. Evil to find out where he is. So Austin travels back to 1975 and gets help from Foxy Cleapatra (destinys child's Beyonce knowles).At the same time, Scott evil (Dr Evils son) is turning evil and Mini me is feeling outcast as Dr Evil is spending more time with his son. So Mini me decides to help Austin (brilliant scene with a mini-austin).Excellent movie. Only one little problem. I don't think that goldmember was used enough.  Given time I think he will be a brilliant character.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
459,mylo57,Not impressed.,5,27 July 2002,"Let me start off by saying that I was greatly disappointed with ""Austin Powers in Goldmember."" We waited 2 hours to see it the night it came out, and I was mad to discover that it turned grossly corney after the first 10 minutes. Granted, I did laugh out loud maybe 3 or 4 times through the rest of the movie, however the third installment of this series is no where near the witticism of the first two. There were nothing but stupid cliches and played out jokes in this movie. Foxy Cleopatra's character was completely underdeveloped. One thing that made the first two movies great was the dynamic relationship between Austin and his leading lady, and there is none of this in Goldmember.I suppose my biggest qualm with this movie was that the editing was HORRIBLE. It was so ridiculously choppy, it seemed like half of the plot must have been cut out. I mean, there were no transitions between scenes what so ever. And where the hell did Britney Spears come from?Finally, why the heck is this movie called ""Goldmember"" in the first place? The Goldmember character is barely even in it, and he is so not funny it's embarrassing to watch.Ok, so my overall rating for this movie is a D+, only because the Tom Cruise bit was hilarious.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
460,gregindy,Bravo! He's Done It Again!,10,28 July 2002,"Another excellent AP movie from Mike Myers and Jay Roach.  The introduction of the very sexy Beyonce Knowles and the movie spoof opening and ending put this movie over the top.  And with Scott's progressive balding and struggle to become closer to his dad, they created a hilarious subplot.  All in all, a great movie.  One wonders where the series will go after the ending (won't spoil it!)",Austin Powers in Goldmember

But don't get we wrong, the opening credits are worth it, so go, and then leave after that.  The best part of the entire experience were the junior mints i was eating during the showing, once those were done, the rest was torture. The jokes were used and abused, and the plot twists and turns reached new rancid heights, even for an austin powers film.  Mike Myeres is a genius, but you can only take one joke so far.  Just watch the first film three times if you want a trilogy.  Be thankful the movie is only a meesly hour and a half, and remember the junior mints.",Austin Powers in Goldmember

466,Vypress,HummmDinger!,3,8 December 2002,Many problems with this one starting with the Toilet humor.  Most of which I found to be stupid.  Myers did okay but adding Goldmember just  made every other character that much weaker.  The ending was also pretty stupid. In my opinion this series should have stopped at 2. It was obvious that this movie had no point to it besides making the trillions of dollars that it did.Beyonce was okay for a first movie although she didn't impress me she didn't do a terrible job with what she had.  No chemistry was made between Austin and Foxy even though they had history.  There was just something wrong with this whole movie.The cameo's were okay I guess although didn't really have a purpose.  Tom Cruise and Gwyneth were good.  Devito was strange as usual.  I was very disappointed in the Britney Spears one where Austin basically humiliates her before blowing her head off.  Why would you do something so cruel as a cameo?Overall not a disgraceful movie.  Don't get me wrong not good either.  4 out of 10,Austin Powers in Goldmember

469,Brippa,Review,8,13 January 2005,"Austin Powers 3 was hilarious. It is extremely entertaining and I laughed all the time. There are some new interesting characters including the latest villain Goldmember, also played by Mike Myers, Cleopatra, a foxy sidekick of Austin's, and Austin's equally horny father Nigel. There is also a cameo of Britney Spears in which she performs a dance-off with Austin. But there are still the same hilarious characters including Fat Bastard, Mini-Me, Dr.Evil with his quirky buddies, and more. If you've seen the first two Austin Powers movies, you must see this one because it is the funniest one of all. Plus, there is a huge surprise ending that is too good to say. I recommend this movie for anyone up for tons of comedy.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
470,matt277,This film is rubbish!,2,20 March 2005,"This film is simply not funny! Not even remotely. Its a series of cliché after cliché and the punch lines are immediately predictable and therefore dull. The biggest flaws are in the characters. Here you have a film where so much of the comedic appeal depends on its characters, yet the characters are in fact the same ones from the previous film and the one before that; characters we have over familiarized ourselves with.This style of comedy is a little dated. The first one was hysterical and the second almost, but this one just does not work, not so much because it doesn't want to but because there is no contextual connection with the audience unless your a 13 year old and you happen to like Britney Spears.If you're an intelligent person however and you actually do have a sense of humor, you will just be thoroughly insulted by how someone over there in Hollywood actually believes he can make someone like you laugh.In short, its nothing more than an ineffectual pile of rubbish. Oh yeah and its quite boring too.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
471,TrafikRptr,Really grows on you,8,11 September 2005,"When I first saw Goldmember, I thought it was the weakest of the three movies. However, I bought all 3 films on DVD. Having watched them again and upon reflection, I have actually come to consider the third movie the best. It's much more solid than the second, and the laughs are more frequent than the original. Recommended scenes: 1) The dance sequence that breaks out following the filming of the ""movie"" in the opening, 2) The shadow-play in the submarine doctor's office,3) The flashback with young Austin, young Dr. Evil, young Basil, and young No. 2 in boarding school, and 4) Any scene with Beyoncé Knowles--she is absolutely magnetic.Honestly, the laughs don't stop.

Well I'd say skip this one but most people will see it anyway (as I did), and the intro is worth seeing before you hear too much more about it.  Just don't be looking for any of the comic revelations of the previous Mike Meyers movies, actually this does feel like Wayne's World 2 (but not as good!!), with it's repetitions from the other movies.

And what was so funny about the other two was that stupid inconsistencies were made fun of and joked about - not so in this case. There also seems to be a somewhat bored, mean-spiritedness pervading the movie, but this may just be a symptom of Myers's boredom.

It was witty, clever, smart and most importantly - RUDE. So with my expectations very high for the third outing for Powers and co., I watched it at a private screening and this is what I thought...After a very impressive opening five minutes involving more A-List talent than a Robert Altman film, the movie slowly starts going downhill as ""gag"" after ""gag"" fails to hit the mark and the only jokes that do work were already done in the previous two AP films.Don't get me wrong though. This movie is far from being bad and some people I watched it with loved it. But I didn't. I tried to love it but I just couldn't.I hated Fat Bastard. I despised Goldmember. Dr. Evil was under-used and Austin Powers just wasn't as rude as he used to be. The second AP was filled with sexual innuendo but this movie had only a handful of decent ""I can't belive he said that"" moments. I was also quite bitter that Heather Graham didn't turn up for a cameo appearence as she is simply forgotten about in this movie.Beyonce Knowles was very good (and damn fine!) as Foxy Cleopatra but the material which she had to work with didn't give her the opportunity to shine as the great comic actress that she seems she can be.I could go on and on about things I didn't like about this movie, but I don't want to get anyone down about it before they've had a chance to see it. Go see it. It's worth the price of a ticket - you just might need to think twice before buying the DVD though...P.S. Mike Myers, if you're reading this, I love your work so don't hate me.

That being said I have to say this was a bit too much re-tread to be enjoyable.I was expecting to be sore from laughing - and it started out great. The whole opening scene was a surprise and had me hysterical. From there it was downhill. If Tom Cruise is the funniest part of a movie then you are in serious trouble.Yes, the movie had a few funny moments but nothing was sustained at all. I don't mind bringing good gags back but it seems like just about every joke is recycled. At least make some kind of effort to put some new GOOD gags into the film.I know the retread gags and the shlocky overused product placement (advertising) is supposed to be an inside joke but it all came across lame. The outright tailoring of much of the movie to the MTV crowd was totally weak. There were entire scenes that were meant to be funny where the theatre was in dead silence (ex. rap video).As I write this I am amazed that this film is listed as 7 star entertainment - maybe I saw a different movie.

The theory seems to be that if several poopoo, teetee and fart jokes were funny, then ten times more of them will be ten times funnier. Uh-uh: it works in inverse proportion. The sole laugh-out-loud I had from this film was a piece of stock footage of a chimp falling out of a tree. The jokes telegraph themselves from miles away, the dialogue is horrible, and the plot...wait, what plot? On paper it would seem like a brainstorming session that no one bothered to write a first draft of. The shadow bit from SHAGGED ME is repeated, as is the bit with Dr. Evil's space ship/satellite/whatever being misidentified as giant body parts, and lots of other bits are rehashed as well. How in God's name is this getting the reviews it's been getting? Has our sense of humor sunk to such a dreadfully low level that we chortle at lists of euphemisms for male genitalia?

It is also loaded with jokes that had no business making it through editing. (Austin: (After destroying a Fembot Britney Spears) Oops, I did it again.)Product placement runs wild through the film as well.Watching  `Goldmember' is for the most part tragically embarrassing.   It occurred to me about 20 minutes into the film that it didn't even seem like it was Mike Myers playing his characters, but rather someone who looked just like Mike Myers but could only do a sloppy impression.   Austin himself is immensely pathetic.  Dr. Evil seems to take on some strange Canadian traits. Fat Bastard...was dead, was he not? Well, anyway, he's annoying  here. And last and least is Goldmember, an annoying  and highly underdeveloped character. (How do we know he likes gold? Because he says he likes gold, that's it.) Other actors don't have much luck either. Beyonce Knowles does practically nothing as Foxy Cleopatra, although she admittedly seems like she could be fun.  Michael Caine is good with what he has, or I should say, what little he has.   Infact, the only consistently funny character is Mini Me, who is suprisingly hilarious in all of his scenes.Part of the problem may be that there are so many `things' the Powers movies always do, that this film is stifled by having to go out of its way to do them. A very unsatisfying series of `It's a (insert body part name here)' should have been cut, rather than kept only to keep with tradition.When the movie is funny, which does happen, it is very funny.  The rap with Dr. Evil and Mini Me in prison is hilarious, the fight between Austin and Mini Me is hilarious.  Some jokes about urination and childbirth are also particularly funny.  These rare moments don't come closing to making up for the general schlock-ish feel of the film.  This Austin Powers is unfunny, predictable and utterly forgettable.",Austin Powers in Goldmember

I couldn't stop laughing from the opening until the closing of the movie. Even the very beginning, and the very very end were funny. I don't recall any boring parts of the movie. This is a great movie, clearly the best Austin Powers one so far. Mike Myers did an incredible job playing the role of 4 characters. The whole idea with the movie being made about Austin Power was hilarious. Especially since they used Tom Cruise, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Danny DeVito. (sorry about my spelling mistakes, if any.)

501,bobbiemercury,the worst of the lot.,1,28 July 2002,"Goldmember isnt as good as the other 2 Austin Powers films. The jokes seem very strained, and apart from a few funny bits, especially a piece in the doctors office, the film never entertains as often as the others. The Goldmember character just doesnt work, Austin Powers himself seems to be struggling badly for any new gags leaving the still brilliant Dr Evil and Mini Me to offer the only funny parts. Although the plot was never the biggest part of these films, Mike Myers seems to have hit a complete dead end. Michael Caine isnt funny, Beyonce does her best in a part that allows little opportunity to be funny. The Fat Bastard character should have been left out, and the name dropping and product placement is way over the top. The opening scene contains a number of famous people such as Tom Cruise, Kevin Spacey and Britney Spears but the musical opening just doesnt work. I thought the film was poor. The jokes have ran dry. Mike Myers needs to move on because he is better than trying out old jokes again.",Austin Powers in Goldmember

I really enjoyed the cameo filled opening but felt that the movie was just a string of cameos and product placement advertising.  Maybe I just came in with high expectations.  There were some funny jokes however and many entertaining moments.  Great performances overall by the whole cast and Michael Caine was exceptionally great.  It didn't feel like there was much new humor-wise to this movie compared to the other two, but it definitely had its exceptionally funny and entertaining moments.  This movie will not hold up and be as timeless as the other two, but nonetheless is an important part of the ongoing(hopefully) Austin Powers saga.",Austin Powers in Goldmember

What set the first two movies out were the unpredictable humor. However, mini-me's defection and the discovery that austin and evil were brothers was pretty sad. Throughout the movie I sat there for long periods of time, waiting for a joke. The subtitle joke was not funny.Overall, a poor version of the first two Austin powers movies. Hopefully, this will be the last. 4/10",Austin Powers in Goldmember

Not a second of celluloid goes by that is not important to complete the movie. The movie could have ended after the opening number and I would have gone home happy. Like it's predecessors, ""Goldmember"" begins with a Broadway-like production. This time it's bigger and better than ever.  A hell of a grabber. Being number three is hard to pull off. The movie humbles itself with obviously blatant yet unashamed reprisals of characters and skits from the two previous A.P. movies. However, by delving further and further into the world of Austin Powers Myers reveals a masterpiece of a world present only in his mind and on film, thank goodness. Watching ""Goldmember"" was fun. So many guest appearances I got lost. Ahhh, what a fun movie. You know that those guest stars were thinking,"" Man-o-man, and I get paid for doing this, too!""

505,sprint7946,"Well contrived jokes make for some great laughs, but at the expense of a cheesy ending.",6,29 July 2002,"For all of those Austin Power's fans, Mike Myer's third installement of the loveable swingin' Brit will make another great fix.  Chalk full of puns and reliably funny spoofs of classic films, Austin Powers in Goldmember, whose title is already a spoof off of the James Bond classic Goldfinger, will bring out the best of laughs in a night of movie going.  Although some critics towted Goldmember's jokes as overdone and the new character's unnecessary, apart from some choppy bridges in the script which seem to be there to move the script in some direction, the jokes seemed genuine and effortless. A lot of what was found hysterical and whitty in the first Austin Powers and in its sequel were matched and fleshed out even further in the latest. Verne Troyer as mini-me and Seth Green as Dr. Evil's son, Scott Evil, were explored more deeply and as a result the ""father-son bond"" which has been explored this summer was brought out here as well. New characters Floxxy Cleopatra, played by Beyonce Knowles, was a great addition, as she easily wins as Austin's most supportive female counterpart (shying away from the ditsy Barbie doll image scultped by Felicity Shagwell in The Spy Who Shagged Me).  Michael Caine as Niegl Powers is as enjoyable as it can be to see Caine as a swingin' superficial father, and Austin as his new character Goldmember is cheeky but more enjoyable to watch than Fat Bastard. Overall Mike Myer's latest sequel to Austin Powers is as enjoyable as one could expect.  Although this movie appears to have more of its script centered on making spoofs of classic dramas and films to bring it some depth, the swingin' attitude and laughs are still enough to make this a film to see in the theater.",Austin Powers in Goldmember

It is immediately apparent how much thought and preparation went into this movie after seeing the opening scene, which the series is famous for. While Goldmember does sometimes seem to re-use jokes, I saw them as references to the previous movies that only increased the enjoyment for the Austin Powers fan. If you're looking for a movie filled with pseudo British comedy, over the top sexual innuendos coming out the rear end and dozens of celebrity cameos then this is your movie. Thanks Mike Myers.

I almost wet myself watching AP2 when it came out. I'd say Gold Member is probably the best film of the three, even though I didnt laugh as much this time round. The reason for that is that ""we're"" so familiar with jokes that they're expected and if you are an Austin fan like me you'll know what I mean. Not that thats a bad thing - It's kind of comfortable. The jokey bits are better than before, most of it is just downright clever. It's worth watching the film just for the cameos. It shows that some of the biggest stars in the world have a sense of humour and can take a dig at themselves. Michael Caine is perfect as Austin's dad - just by being himself - no make up was required :) Mini-me is ace as he ""develops"" - wont spoil it - you'll see.To the uninitiated, Austin Powers is a real p*** take of the spy genre films, especially James Bond. Just imagine James Bond being played and written by Dick Emery and you're nearly there - except Mike Myers is in my opinion far more entertaining and clever than the great Emery ever was. If you liked the Waynes World stuff you'll be an Austin fan I promise.People either love or hate Austin films.

They had no problem in saying ""balls"" and ""nuts"", and Fat Bastard describing how he left a piece of excrement and a bad smell in his sumo rag. I say plotless because i never actually saw a plot emerge through the thirty minutes i viewed. I suppose there was a plot after i left, but that is a little late for me.  During the 30 minutes i watched the film, I saw 2 families leave with their childern.

Beyonce Knowles (from Destiny's Child, but don't hold that against her) did a fantastic Foxy Cleopatra who's only downfall, sadly, was that she wasn't in the movie enough for my liking !!

Just a coincidence I guess. I've seen the movie listed as being 2:13 long but I timed it at 1:28.I realize that Mike Meyers did this show as a tribute to his father, but for the type of shows the first two Austin Powers movies were about, this one seemed rather sappy. I respect the love and affection he had for his real father, but it just didn't play well in a bathroom humor type of comedy. Not to give it away, but the ending was completely awful.

Each one has such a different personality, that only a multi-talented person such as Myers could pull it off.  Austin Powers still knocks them dead in this movie.  Dr. Evil is back and is still as funny as ever.  Fat Bastard returns with his disgusting characteristics that are so gross, you have to laugh.  Myers' newest character Johan Van Der Smut, aka Goldmember doesn't totally cut it.  He just wasn't funny.I found that Beyonce Knowles was rather sexy in Goldmember.  But the whole ""sugar"" quote that she would constantly use got rather annoying quite quickly.  Michael Caine was absolutely hilarious.  He fit the whole swinging spy part, and even gave off a fatherly vibe.  He was wonderful.I have to recommend this movie for anyone who likes to laugh.

Plot was pretty good, but not as good as I thought it would be.Overall: 3 out of 5 stars",Austin Powers in Goldmember
539,mstngcnvrtble,I actually subscribed to IMDB to tell the world about this movie...,1,16 August 2002,"What a waste of 30 bucks! I cannot believe how bad this movie was considering how clever the first two were. In fact, the first two films are so much a part of my life that I regularly quote them in my daily interactions (pathetic as that is).I went into Goldmember wanting to love it and what was presented was (painfully) recycled jokes with a few bellylaughs (due to the occasional original joke in-between). It's obvious that the whole group who put out this turkey got lazy, full of themselves and self-indulgent. I swear, if one more person mugged for the camera, I was going to scream. And by the way, whoever edited this thing should be shot because it was choppy and flowed about as well as nitro-glycerin in an earthquake.I hope this is the last edition of Austin Powers because it's obvious that the franchise has run its course. Save your money. I would say don't even bother with the DVD.Feh! Pee-yew!",Austin Powers in Goldmember
540,benjigoo,LOLOLOLOL,10,21 August 2002,I wasn't really looking forward to watching this movie because I am not a huge fan of the series. Some friends dragged me to the movie and I have never laughed so hard in my life. This movie was awesome and the one liners make you double over. You must see this movie!!!!,Austin Powers in Goldmember
541,goldie_kiki,too many cameos,7,5 December 2002,"I was holidaying on a TV-less island when this film came out and i was so looking forward to watching it. So when I finally did watch it I was very disappointed at how many cameo appearances there were by celebrities. The best thing about the first two was that almost everyone in the films had a legitimate role. But this one had celebrities everywhere and had nothing to do with the storyline. It seemed as though the success of the film was riding on these celebrities.Besides that, I loved it. The way Mike Myers can play four different characters in the one film is amazing. He is an exceptional actor and writer.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
542,kaw777,Awful!!!,1,27 September 2002,Dont even wait till video..this movie was horrible..Same ole Lame fart jokes..cmon Hollywood get an original idea for once. Even Fat Bastard wasnt that funny... Not only was this the worst of all 3 movies..it ranks up there with the worst movies ever made.,Austin Powers in Goldmember
543,freshminty,meh,5,2 October 2002,"Beyonce is a great actress, surprisingly, However, the movie was disappointing. The ending was not satisfying, while there were only some good moments.Still very enjoyable, just nothing great.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
544,RavenChild,Only for people who like overplayed jokes.,5,13 October 2002,"The basic plot of this movie makes no sense.  But at least they did us the curtesy of covering it up with overplayed jokes. Don't get me wrong, I loved #1 and #2 but 3 was simply a regurgitated copy of the previous ""Powers"" movies only mushed into a different order.  The casting, although it was much the same, was both good and bad.  Personally the previous leading ladies well exceeded Beyonce Knowles by a far shot. The more I tryed to understand it's stupidity the more I realized I wasted a perfectly good night on a perfectly awful movie.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
545,StlCardinalslife,Very decent comedy,6,6 February 2009,"Flashy, Funny, and Favorable when compared the the previous two installments.Austin Powers is pitted against Dr. Evil yet again to save his father (Caine) with the aid of Foxxy Cleopatra (Knowles). Michael Caine is a great addition to the series and brings a great amount of credibility to the character, not to mention the resemblance. Beyonce's performance is adequate, and Seth Green's character has a bit of a larger role, though I wish it was bigger because he is hilarious as Evil's son. Let's not forget to mention Fred Savage as ""The Mole"", a funny character that they made sure not to show us too often so the mole joke never dies. There are great cameos and an excellent production design (Evil's new submarine lair is by far the best).Bottom line is, if you like comedies that aren't dark or just plain silly, you'll like this movie because it is somewhere in between.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
546,j_a_l,You saw the 2 previous ??? you already saw the good parts,4,15 June 2003,"I thought it could be as good as austin power #2 but this is really... boring. Not there are no good moments, but as said, it's exactly the same (good and bad) jokes made in the two previous !!!! Now this is the third, so you get the obviously ""all hollywood superstars"" making cameo like ""hey, I'm not so serious and borring: look, I'm here"", and don't forget all 'cliché' you may expect, and more. For the plot it's simple : there is none... whatever, many people want to see the same thing so let's do it, production same money while getting ours.Conclusion : don't even waste the renting, for a good moment you better watch the previous one again.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
547,rbeale,"objective, perhaps even subjective, comments from a fan",5,30 November 2002,"With hindsight, I think I had an over-developed sense of excitement about this movie. I'd enjoyed the first two which I saw as a back to back double header - imagine that! Anyway, it was probably unrealistic to expect that the standard could possibly be maintained when the same characters are required to come up with a new and bizarre storyline, the third time around. OK, it wasn't quite up to scratch but, nevertheless, I had a few good laughs - it was worth the money, but don't expect to double up with laughter; be happy to be mildly amused. Signing-off, your reviewer, Richard.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
548,UpInTheClouds,"I wanted to like it, really I did.",3,18 January 2003,"I saw both of the first Austin Powers movies and really liked them. After seeing goldmember, I forget why. The movie was boring. The cameos were irritating and unnecessary. I noticed a lot of things that were supposed to be funny, but only laughed on a few occasions. I remember hearing from some of my friends that it was quite funny, but I really think I'll have to watch it again to see what other people laugh at, because i just did not enjoy it. Mike Meyers is tired, though has his moments as Austin, and Caine did decently well in a few scenes, but the movie as a whole failed. BTW, my tiredness upon viewing, accompanied by a hope that at some point the movie would improve, are the only things that kept me from fast-forwarding or stopping the movie. Ugh. I often caught myself staring at foxxy's cleavage, which was far more interesting than the actual movie most of the time. 3/10 for disappointment",Austin Powers in Goldmember
549,sfx-6,Painfully unfunny...(minor spoilers),1,19 July 2003,"I don't know how in the world did I sit even halfway through this movie, let alone through its etirety. A horrid amalgamation of wannabe-monty-python jokes, toilet humor, and mindless camp. I'm a fan of absurd and campy stuff (e.g. the Evil Dead movies), but come on. Mike Myers thinks that anyone can be funny simply by battering nonsense. It takes a lot of nerve NOT to be funny when parodying M:I-2. But I thought that it is virtually impossible if you can include Tom Cruise in a cameo! To my surprise, even that was accomplished in a brilliant fashion. And that is what this movie is about: an endless showcase of opportunities for a good laugh. He had it everything, and he flopped. Greatly. Only because of Beyonce (NOT the acting): 0.5\100",Austin Powers in Goldmember
550,Stargate2020,One of the best comedy ever,10,12 August 2003,This movie was great. It took all the funny things from the first two and put them into one movie. Mike Myers is just Great. This is one of his best works. All the jokes that Mike comes up are the great. If you only see one comedy in your life make it this one you. will be glad you saw it.,Austin Powers in Goldmember
551,shaneb166er,"Not another sequel ""Possible spoilers""",2,27 September 2003,"Back in 1997 Austin Powers came out and well it did good and the box-office and in 1999 the cheesy sequel appeared out of nowhere.Then there was this travesty of a film in 2002. The original had class,it was a fresh idea about a agent from the 60's frozen only to reapper in the 90's to fight his arch nemesis.Sure they jokes were'nt hilarious but they were original and being a spoof of James Bond,it contained subtle and unsubtle references to the series.Then ""The Spy who Shagged Me"" came out an it was okay.Now that Mike Myers played three characters there was a few more jokes and Mini-me.Slowly the jokes became more desperate fart jokes(Although though one or two were humorous)until eventually the ""Dr.Evil spaceship"" came along and then I finally gave up on the film. ""Goldmember"" was the worst of the bunch(What with Beyonce Knowles involved)and there was even more dumb jokes one after another(Okay I did laugh at the spoof joke with Gwenyth Paltrow,Tom Cruise,etc.because that was funny).Unfortunatley it was by the time that Britney Spears appear I knew things were going to get worse(Oh where to start!) Firstly there was the whole ""Daddy wasn't There crap"" and suddenly theres the Fook sisters.Next was the school for secret agents which just happens to have all the main characters from the last two films oh! and whats this another time machine,an annoying guy with peeling skin(plus poor speech and constantly declaring ""I'm dutch!!"" a la european stereotypes).The we had to see a horrible rendition of ""It's a hardknock life""(Ooh!!Isn't that Ben Savage and some cheap mole jokes),a disturbing scene in jail between Myers and Sterling(By the way the interragation scene with the subtitles,it was unnecessary for Beyonce to read them out loud),a unforgiving godzilla joke and a repeat of the ""spaceship"" joke mentioned earlier(Like we need The Osbournes cameo just to remind us that).Micheal Caine on the other hand plays his role very well as usual but dosn't save this excuse for a movie.Now with Seth Green as a possible villian and Demi Moore in talks I sleep more restless each night until this turkey(Please God!Just to teach them not to make more sequels)is out in the cinema.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
552,finalfanmaster3,Was disappointed.....,2,20 July 2005,"When I first heard the movie was coming out, I couldn't wait to see it. Knowing how well both the the first and second one were done, I figure 3rd would be better because to me it seemed to get better and better. SOme things they left out that made me cry (exagerating) were Mustafa character, the unnecessary slow death, the ""zip-it"" and ""shhh"" cycle, many others that were in the first and second one that wern't in the third one.The plot was okay in the middle, but the surprise ending was incredibly foolish. To me, the third one was completely out of place in the Austin Power series. O, well.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
553,Justlikemia9,If your appalled by this movie..get over it..you should have known..this is the third one!!,6,4 October 2005,"Some may say that this movie is ridiculous or disgusting because of its, bathroom humor, and the constant dirty, but sometimes vague references to something sexual.But haven't those people figured out by now that this movie is not for them? I mean there's been two movies before this and it isn't a surprise the kind of humor that is used in these movies. The Austin Power movies are about poking fun at things us as human beings do not discuss often and for that matter at all sometimes.Its about pushing the limits in comedy and showing people that hey this stuff can be funny if you think about it.Austin powers is hilarious,and I think that Goldmember was the best out of the three.Now don't get me wrong this movie had its flaws like all other movies do,but for what it is, I was really entertained by this and encourage those to see it.",Austin Powers in Goldmember
554,murmak-1,Shmoke and the pancake?,10,11 January 2006,"First of all I have to admin I've first seen 2nd part of this trilogy than Goldmember and finally after plenty of viewing of this funniest movie ever made the first one. Well I have nothing to say but it's simply the best comedy ever made, from the first pre-caption scene through very best I don't know, who am I... Yes, I would like some chocolate asscream. Perhaps later... Prison rap and escape scene... MOLE... Shmoke and the pancake?... Toied like a toiger... I can't imagine what will come next from Mr. Myers but he has really huge challenge to beat this... I know every single line of script, am able to watch this every day (as far as Shrek 1+2, accidentally (?) another Myers-in movie :) Bravo! And for those who are grunting this: just try to watch this couple of times, you'll soon find the real beauty of this movie. It's spectacular. You'll be laughting your ass off, trust me. Just watch it with your friends with open minds!",Austin Powers in Goldmember
