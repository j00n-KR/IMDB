0,TheLittleSongbird,"Great cast and beautifully filmed, but I couldn't help thinking it could have been better",6,16 May 2011,"It's Complicated is a good movie in my opinion, but it isn't a great one. There are some undeniably good things though. The film looks absolutely beautiful with the scenery and location shooting striking and the photography capturing it wonderfully. The soundtrack is beguiling without being too overbearing or too low-key, and the direction is excellent. While I wasn't as taken with the script and story as much as I would've liked, both have their moments. When it comes to the story, the reaction of the kids when they found about their parents was especially surprisingly well-done, and there are several parts mostly in the final third where the writing is funny, quirky and touching. What really lifts It's Complicated is the cast. All three leads-Meryl Streep, Alec Baldwin and Steve Martin-do some of their better work in recent years here. Martin is probably the weakest of the three despite his character being the most likable, not because he is bad in fact he is very good, but because I would've loved to have seen more of him as it's the third act really where he and his character shines through. Streep is wonderfully infectious and bubbly, and Baldwin's persona here is less cynical and more sleazeball which works. John Krasinski also has some comedy gold moments without feeling too out of place. The characters on the surface in general are clichéd, but in general they are also likable. On the other hand, I didn't completely buy the ""happy"" ending and in all honesty I could see it coming from miles away. The story is unevenly paced too with some of the middle dragging and like the ending it is rather predictable. The script while funny, touching and quirky often does also have too many moments of clichés, corniness and dumbness, and the title I did find rather obvious but in regards to the latter it's probably me being picky. Overall, good but not great, it's lucky that the cast is as good as it is. 6/10 Bethany Cox",It's Complicated
1,SnoopyStyle,Love Triangle (old divorced edition),6,14 October 2013,"Jane Adler (Meryl Streep) is an unattached divorced successful businesswoman who's facing an empty nest situation. Her youngest Gabby (Zoe Kazan) is headed off to college. Her ex Jack (Alec Baldwin) has a trophy wife Agness (Lake Bell). Jane reconnects with her ex Jack, and then Adam Schaffer (Steve Martin) the architect working on her shop.I can admit that I'm not the target audience. I don't want to see Baldwin's bare butts. I don't find older women making sexual jokes that funny. It's cute, but not my cup of tea. I'm not a divorced older woman. Having said that, I still find some of it funny. The biggest appeal is the relationship with the kids and how the older couple's love affair affects them.I found Alec Baldwin annoyingly needy. Meryl Streep gives a sweet performance. But Steve Martin lack any spark. He tries so hard to be cool that he becomes cold. I just don't feel the heat between Streep and Martin.",It's Complicated
2,kosmasp,It is indeed complicated ...,7,12 May 2010,"The movie as it is, wouldn't have deserved more than 5/10 points (maybe 6). Which isn't really bad, but with the actors this elevates to a higher level. Meryl Streep and Alec Baldwin are really great in this and Krasinski, although he only has a small part, steals the show in almost all of his scenes. He is really funny in this and quite different from the character he is portraying in ""Away we go"" (a man we should be looking out for perhaps? Definitely!) You can see how much fun everyone has and although the story evolves exactly how would predict it will (after a few minutes into the film), the performances keep you interested. A fun and light movie, that shouldn't be taken too seriously and can be a nice watch for a couple (to be) ;o)",It's Complicated
3,jboothmillard,It's Complicated,8,12 September 2010,"From director Nancy Meyers (What Women Want, The Holiday), I saw a few short trailers for this romantic comedy, and besides the three leading stars, it looked like a film I'd probably like, so I tested that out. Basically successful bakery owner Jane (Golden Globe nominated Meryl Streep) has been divorced from lawyer ex-husband Jake Adler (BAFTA nominated Alec Baldwin) for ten years, after he ran off with and remarried with the younger Agness (Lake Bell). They are only brought together again to see the college graduation of their grown up son Luke (Hunter Parrish), and Jane has her friends saying she needs to reignite her sex life, and soon enough she does. Jake asks Jane to dinner to catch up on old times, but with the help of a little alcohol this quickly turns into a re-attraction for each other, and Jane has become ""the other woman"". Jane and Jake continue this affair that they feel isn't as wrong as most would be, but it does affect their personal lives, Jane with her grown up kids Luke, engaged Lauren (Caitlin Fitzgerald) and Gabby (Zoe Kazan), and Agness is having fertility tests. Jane's situation is made more difficult by the arrival of architect Adam Schaffer (Steve Martin) who is remodelling the house, and he is quite quickly smitten with Jane, and he himself is recovering from divorce. Of course Adam is unaware of Jane is up to, and is let down one or two times by her excuses, and Lauren's fiancée Harley (License to Wed's John Krasinski) is really shocked to see them going to hotel room together. After being stood up by Jake, who had to be around for Agness while she was doing her stuff, Jane decides to invite Adam to the graduation party for Luke, and she smokes the marijuana joint Jake gave her. Adam joins her, a jealous Jake has a quick puff as well, and the confronting Harley feels like he needs a puff too, and unfortunately seeing Jane and Jake dancing together, Agness finds out about them renewing closeness. Jane and Adam leave the party to go dancing and enjoy some handmade chocolate croissants in her bakery, and the next day Jake has been kicked out by Agness and needs somewhere to stay, so the kids are very keen for him to be let in. It is when Jake tries to both woo Jane with the laptop computer webcam still running to Adam that he and the kids find out about the affair, and Jane asks him to leave. After the kids, still recovering from the divorce, drive away from Jake, Jane reconciles with them so that they know she doesn't plan to get back with their father. The film ends with Jane and Jake ending the affair on friendly terms, and Adam has returned to carry on with the work on the house, and they walk in laughing together (a relationship blooming, who knows?). Also starring Being John Malkovich's Mary Kay Place as Joanne and Jingle All the Way's Rita Wilson as Trisha. Streep as usual is reliable as the both concerned and relishing ex-wife mistress, Baldwin is likable as the persuasive and slightly sleazy horny old dog ex-husband, and Martin gets his moments as the striving and optimistically doe-eyed nice guy. If it wasn't for them this film might not do as well, it is certainly a different kind of romantic comedy, seeing how the ones having an affair used to be in love anyway, it's definitely one to see. It was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy and Best Screenplay for Meyers. Very good!",It's Complicated
4,moonspinner55,Rich in production sheen...if nothing else,4,29 January 2012,"Middle-aged woman, un-kissed for many years, has an affair with her ex-husband, now married to a demanding bombshell, while also beginning a new relationship with her architect. Director and screenwriter Nancy Meyers doesn't come up with scenes--she writes situations. The plot of ""It's Complicated"" can be categorized by its events (always underscored with pop hits from the past); the characters are just writer's tools. Meryl Streep lets her hair down (and is appealing doing so), but this is the kind of undemanding, underwhelming movie she can do in her sleep. In the male roles, Alec Baldwin and Steve Martin take turns checking Meryl out, making her giggle, getting her drunk and stoned. It all goes down like an expensive dessert: creamy-smooth, fattening, and not at all good for you. ** from ****",It's Complicated
5,blanche-2,A good cast is better than its material,7,31 May 2010,"Kudos to writer/director Nancy Meyers for again hitting an untapped market - baby boomers and specifically women of a certain age, who remain invisible in Hollywood. In ""It's Complicated,"" Meryl Streep is a divorcée who drifts into an affair with her ex-husband (Alec Baldwin). Meanwhile, the man in charge of her house construction (Steve Martin) is attracted to her.For someone my own age, this film had some very enjoyable moments, and the music is just great. It's not a fabulous film, but a film with good scenes and very good performances. Streep, Baldwin, and Martin are all capable of handling stronger material. I would have loved to seen a funnier Martin (the scene where he's driving and listening to a ""get over your divorce"" tape is very funny). Baldwin, who has found a niche in comedy, is very good as Streep's immature ex-husband. Streep is her usual wonderful self.All in all, I'm glad I saw this on Movies on Demand and not in the theater. It's a good rental.",It's Complicated
6,Quinoa1984,"I enjoyed it, in spite of itself",5,3 January 2010,"During the interim between Sex and the City and Sex and the CityII in theaters, women 45 and up (give or take a few years) can all cloister together and indulge in Nancy Meyers' fantasy on a wacky infidelity rom-com. It's so wacky that one might suspect that, had it been made seventy years ago and Alec Baldwin's ass been out of frame (and the pot excised), it could easily be shown on TCM in morning slots during the week, the time of day one usually sees those romantic comedies (half-screwball, half-whatever) that concern relationships where not much is really wrong except the nature of perception. It's a fluffy little movie made for the libido left in middle-aged women, though I'm sure the movie will get (and has already gotten) many viewers of any sex or age - whether the men went willingly I have to just take a guess.The cast is hard to resist, and even if they were just riding around on tricycles and whistling Yankee Doodle Dandy for the whole running time we'd go see it for Streep, Baldwin, Martin, even Krasinski for some of us Office fans. It's about successful people with very nice homes (one of which, Streep's successful divorcée baker-CEO, needs even MORE bedroom and kitchen and so on, just in case she needs to get her Charles Foster Kane on), and how Streep and Baldwin's characters, divorced from each other for ten years, suddenly have a drunken night of sex, and then against (some of) their better judgment it continues when they go home to California. And then wackiness, of course, ensues when Martin, a very nice and sincere guy, falls for Streep, and she likes him too. What to do with all these men? Make croissants and smoke pot, of course.Like Something's Gotta Give, it's a very light affair with actors/stars that are hard to ignore how good they are (before it was Nicholson and Keaton, now Streep and Baldwin part of Meyer's stupid frivolity and sex jokes), but it's also hard to take it entirely too seriously. We see how conflict-free the relationship is between these two people, who have known each other and off-and-on loved each other since their 20's, and not once, until the sort of abrupt and predictable ending, do we see conflict erupt and the affair take a turn. But there's nothing really to see Streep's character have a problem with. She's almost too bubbly, an escapism icon that is hard to shrug off.... and yet, the movie is filled with some really funny moments, almost in spite of itself. Baldwin especially is having a great time in his liberated sort-of adulterer, and Martin gets his first genuine laughs in years (albeit in a silly pot-smoking scene that's like Cheech and Chong for dummies).It's glossy, it's nice, it's got a scene involving the three kids of the ex-couple stunned in bed as if ten years were just yesterday, and in the end everything is neat and tidy. And like any given Sex and the City episode (or for that matter the first movie), it's something I will likely forget entirely in a week or so. 5.5/10",It's Complicated
7,tavm,"Nancy Meyers' It's Complicated is a very worthy showcase for veterans Streep, Baldwin, and Martin",10,25 January 2010,"Just watched this romantic comedy written and directed by Nancy Meyers and starring Meryl Streep, Alec Baldwin, and Steve Martin. Streep and Baldwin are a divorced middle-aged couple who suddenly become involved again but secretly. Martin is a builder of Streep's upcoming cottage who finds he has feelings for her. The film takes its time in characterizations before some great hilarity ensures especially when future son-in-law John Krasinski finds out what's what. I loved recognizing many of the songs used in the soundtrack. It's also nice to see how the drama that ensues flows naturally near the conclusion. So for all that, It's Complicated is most definitely worth seeing.",It's Complicated
8,edwagreen,It's Complicated- Love After Divorce ***1/2,9,13 November 2010,"Wonderful romantic comedy where Meryl Streep, Steve Martin and Alec Baldwin really let their hair down!Love and understanding really begin here 10 years after divorcing with 3 children. Streep and Baldwin rekindle their love when they attend their youngest son's college graduation.Baldwin is apparently unhappily married. Imagine, the woman he married left him and had a child with another guy before returning to him. O well, this is the 21st century!When not romping around in this joyful film, Steve Martin shows a maturity that we have never seen before in any of his previous films.The film is a good one as it keeps you guessing who Streep will finally wind up with. Martin is the perfect foil as the architect building a home for Streep while falling for her at the same time.The film is definitely an attempt for Baldwin (Jacob Adler) and Jane (Streep) to ignite a spark that seemed to have gone out years before.Charming and sophisticated, this is a welcomed delight to the viewer.",It's Complicated
9,michaelRokeefe,Not complicated at all...a bit disappointing.,8,7 May 2010,"How can a movie starring Meryl Streep with Alec Baldwin fall a bit short? You just come to expect more; that's not saying IT'S COMPLICATED isn't a hoot to watch. It does have some very funny situations and truthfully this is the best I've ever seen Streep; she is so approachable as Jane Adler. Jane and Jake(Baldwin)have been divorced for ten years with three adult children. On the weekend of their son's graduation; Jane and Jake have a drunken fling that ends up being a tricky and secretive affair. My favorite sequence is when Jane and her architect(Steve Martin)get high on a pot-fueled date.

10,sunwarrior13,Veteran Cast Elevates The Film,10,1 October 2012,"Meryl Streep, Steve Martin and Alec Baldwin star in this hilarious look at marriage, divorce and everything in between in this film entitled,It's Complicated.It was written and directed by Nancy Meyers.An aged, divorced mother becomes ""the other woman"" in her ex-husband's life when the pair enters into an unexpected affair during an out-of- town trip. Jane has been divorced from Jake for a decade. The mother of three grown children, she owns a successful Santa Barbara bakery/restaurant and maintains a friendly relationship with Jake, who has since been remarried to the much younger Agness. Jane and Jake are attending their son's college graduation when they agree to an innocent meal together. Before long a simple dinner date has erupted into an all- out affair, and when architect Adam falls for Jane, he realizes he's been drawn into a most peculiar love triangle. Is love sweeter the second time around? Or will Jane and Jake just be happy with what they had, and finally move on with their lives?It's really not all that complicated. But it is entertaining. It's pure, simple fun, with Meryl Streep and Alec Baldwin playing a divorced couple as they might have been if they had ruled in the sexually knowing thoughts, instead of the virginal ear.But despite fine work by an appealing cast, It's Complicated is predictable romantic comedy fare, going for broad laughs instead of subtlety and nuance.Nevertheless,the veteran cast elevate the film way above the level of mediocrity.",It's Complicated
11,studioAT,"It's just not that funny or interesting, let alone complicated",2,29 August 2017,"With three big name stars topping the bill my hopes were high for this film, but sadly nothing that occurred in the nearly two hour running time ever matched up to the potential the cast, and indeed the premise had.It's not a bad film, it just feels like lots of little sketches thrown rather slowly together. While it was nice to see Steve Martin playing a different role, this film just wasn't that interesting at points, and not even a small role for the always lovely Zoe Kazan could help boost it.A shame.",It's Complicated
12,preppy-3,It's very OK with some GREAT moments,7,28 December 2009,"Jane (Meryl Streep) has been divorced from Jake (Alec Baldwin) for 10 years. He also married the woman he cheated with. At their youngest son's graduation they get drunk and end up in bed. Jake LOVES it and wonders why he left Jane. Jane feels guilty for committing adultery. But Jake presses her to continue having sex which she enjoys. Then she meets nice divorced Adam (Steve Martin) and falls for him!Somewhat predictable (I saw the ending coming a mile away) and not really that good but I must admit this movie has some great moments. First of all the cast is great--Streep, Baldwin and Martin all play their roles beautifully in dramatic AND comedic scenes. Also John Krasinski has lots of good moments as Harley. The real problem is the script. It's just a little TOO predictable and frankly not funny enough. Some of the lines were lame and I didn't buy the happy ending for one second (although I admit it made me cry--a little). It 's just there were a few wonderful moments that really worked. The reaction of the kids when they found out their mom and dad were sleeping together was beautifully done and nobody was totally evil or totally good. You saw the good and bad in all the characters and understood their motivations. Also the movie looks beautiful with incredibly gorgeous locations and settings. And the final sequence where everything goes spinning totally out of control WAS very funny! Also it was touching more than once--me and quite a few of the women in the audience got misty-eyed over some sequences. So a very GOOD movie but not a great one. I give it a 7.A word about the R rating. Ignore it--this is PG-13 all the way. It got an R rating because two people smoke a joint and are NOT punished. Seriously--that's it! That's no reason! In ""9 to 5"" made back in 1980 the three main characters share a joint, they're not punished and it got a PG!!!! There are some VERY brief flashes of back male nudity but no more than u can see on TV. So--ignore the R rating.",It's Complicated
13,writers_reign,And It Used To Be So Easy ...,7,8 January 2010,"... if you wanted to show Mature Romance you just sent for Tracy and Hepburn, Grant and Bergman, Powell and Loy, put-in-your-own-choice. Now it's not so easy. Meryl Streep is a fine actress and a worthy Award winner, Baldwin and Martin aren't exactly chopped liver and even the rest of the cast - more or less unknown to me - were competent. So what went wrong ... hard to say but watching it I kept thinking of Indiscreet with Cary Grant, Ingrid Bergman and lots of elegance, people able to afford four-star hotels, ballet, opera whatever with no visible means of support. Thing is, Indiscreet was considered sub-standard at the time (though I liked it). A younger generation who know Grant, Hepburn, Tracy etc only as names occasionally glimpsed on the Late, Late Show will probably have no problem with this and probably had no problem with the director's other movies.

15,evanston_dad,Meryl Streep Is Too Good for This Movie (Most Actors Would Be),3,4 June 2010,"The title might be ""It's Complicated,"" but my personal assessment isn't: this movie sucks.This dire romantic ""comedy"" exists in a fantasy world that doesn't remotely resemble any world I've ever seen or lived in. Everyone lives in a house or apartment that looks like an ad for Crate & Barrel, everyone's attractive and tanned, everybody has lots of money but no one ever seems to work. Yet we're supposed to care about these peoples' trials and tribulations.Meryl Streep and Alec Baldwin play a divorced couple who strike up an affair when passions are rekindled. Baldwin is married to a woman with a five-year-old, but the screenplay is so anxious to avoid conflict and keep us on Streep's and Baldwin's side that it makes Baldwin's wife a bitch and avoids completely Baldwin's failure to be a father figure. Streep's shrink actually tells her to give in to her urges and have fun with them -- what shrink in the world would tell a woman in this situation that any course other than calling the whole thing off would be harmful and destructive to all involved. The film is called ""It's Complicated"" but wants to deny all of the real complications that in real life would make this situation a hurtful and disastrous affair.The whole film is horribly miscast. Streep is far too confident and imperious a screen presence to be believable as someone who would find Alec Baldwin (whose ick factor is amped up to deafening levels) irresistible; Steve Martin gets saddled with a lump of a character with no opportunity to flex his comic muscles. Even Lake Bell, who was absolutely the only thing that made ""Over Her Dead Body"" (speaking of dire romantic comedies) even close to watchable, is asked to show not an ounce of the charm or comedic timing she displayed in that other film.The makers of this movie and those who keep inflicting ""Sex and City"" on us need to be told that not everyone finds middle-aged people acting like teenagers to be the height of sophisticated comedy. Some of us actually find it sad and pathetic.Grade: D",It's Complicated
16,ferguson-6,Rocking the Boat in Santa Barbara,5,1 January 2010,"Greetings again from the darkness. Making Romantic Comedies that women love and men can tolerate is very difficult. Writer/director Nancy Meyers has become the most successful female director in Hollywood for this genre. Unfortunately her films' appeal always lean toward the female perspective and rank high on the cringe factor for men. Examples include Something's Gotta Give, The Holiday and What Women Want. Compare this work to that of Nora Ephron's When Harry Met Sally, You've Got Mail and, Julie and Julia. Actually there is little comparison. Ephron understands how adults think and Meyers is focused on women's fantasies.Still, Meyers has tapped into the female psyche and delivers what they want. Here the great and beautiful and highly successful Meryl Streep is pursued and coveted by both Alec Baldwin and Steve Martin. Oh yeah, Baldwin is a successful lawyer and Martin a successful architect. Wouldn't quite fulfill the fantasy if one of the pursuers worked at a bowling alley, eh?Comedy ensues when adultery, lying and alcohol and drugs become involved. Nothing funnier than the topics that destroy people's lives. I tend to give viewers a bit more credit. Most already understand that people don't shrivel up when they get divorced or turn 55. Life goes on and continues to blossom, if you work at it - just like when you are 25.On the bright side, Streep and Baldwin are very good in their roles. There are some very well written scenes and Streep is such a master that she makes EVERY one of her scenes a bit better than it otherwise would be. Steve Martin is given little to do other than a stupid skit in the car with a self-help disc on getting over a divorce (2 years later) and a failed bit with web cam where Streep helps him clean out his wardrobe.Supporting work from John Krasinski (The Office), Lake Bell and an over the top Rita Wilson add the elements you would expect. There is even an homage paid to The Graduate - possibly an admission by Ms. Meyers that her movie on adultery is far less than the gold standard.",It's Complicated
17,anaconda-40658,It's Streep!,8,10 March 2016,"It's Complicated (2009): Dir: Nancy Meyers / Cast: Meryl Streep, Alec Baldwin, Steve Martin, John Krasinski, Lake Bell: Hilarious romantic comedy about regret. Meryl Streep plays a chef and mother, and Alec Baldwin plays her ex husband who is involved in an unsuccessful relationship with a younger woman. Director Nancy Meyers springs humour from the affair between the two. Meyers is a bankable director having made such entertaining films as The Holiday and Something's Gotta Give. Streep brings out the guilt, confusion and yearning of a woman drawn back to the past. She delights in the youthful feeling of affection. Baldwin brings out the regret of his past decision and the amusement of rediscovering what he originally had. His fascination with young love turns into a demanding standoff with a son who shares his mother's sense of self. Steve Martin plays a construction contractor whom becomes involved with Streep. He is innocent but unable to sideline Baldwin's pursuits. In the end he is in the right state of mind. Other roles are pretty much cardboard mainly consisting of the couple's children who band together and hunch on the behavior of their mother and father. Amongst those is John Krasinski as Streep's son, and Lake Bell as Baldwin's wife and neither can stand against the three leads. It examines marriage and relationships and other complications.

18,HotToastyRag,Doesn't live up to the title,7,10 September 2019,"Have you noticed that Meryl Streep tends to make two or three heavy, serious movies and then as her reward has a silly, contemporary fling immediately afterwards? After the extremely heavy drama Doubt and the period piece Julie & Julia, she made Nancy Meyers's It's Complicated, a silly, contemporary fling, which preceded The Iron Lady, Hope Springs, and August: Osage County, which were all very heavy.If you like period-piece-Meryl far better than contemporary-Meryl, you're not going to like this movie. Just stick to her dramas and save yourself two hours. This movie is very silly, and a typical Nancy Meyers unrealistic chick flick. If you thought The Holiday was too sweet and Something's Gotta Give had an unrealistic ending, you're not going to like this movie. I absolutely loved The Holiday, and own a copy of Something's Gotta Give, but I didn't really like this one, so my advice is to watch the preview and see if it appeals to you. It's a very good representative of the full feature.Meryl Streep and Alec Baldwin are divorced and adjusting to their new lives. He was unfaithful and married the other woman, Lake Bell. Meryl finds comfort by gabbing with her girlfriends, Rita Wilson and Mary Kay Place. Steve Martin is a steady, stable architect with a nice personality, intelligence, and an unrealistic lack of flaws, in keeping with Nancy Meyers tradition. Meryl starts to date Steve, and all of a sudden, Alec gets tired of his midlife crisis and wants Meryl back-also in keeping with an unrealistic Nancy Meyers tradition. So, she juggles both and tries to decide who she wants in her life.It's every woman's fantasy for her ex-husband to ditch his 20-something babe of a wife and want her back, and to have the opportunity to go out with a dependable, kind man and also have fun with an irresponsible man. It's just not entirely realistic that this would happen. If you love your movies to be fluffy fiction, go out and rent It's Complicated.

The pretty settings in Santa Barbara and New York are very nice to look at. For people who liked Something's Got to Give, there are some similarities here - the older woman with 2 choices for a man, excessive giggling and a satisfying if predictable ending.The casting in the movie could have been slightly better. Alec Baldwin is a bit too fat but he is amusing most of the time. Meryl is a bit too old and out of shape - it would have been better with someone about a bit younger and more attractive like Diane Lane. Steve Martin is good as a depressed yet amusing architect. Jon Krasinski is sweet bordering on annoying. Zoe Kazan is a bit unattractive and doesn't resemble the rest of the family.",It's Complicated
20,gradyharp,"Not so complicated, more like silly",4,28 April 2010,"Nancy Meyers wrote and directed this film about a strange form of adultery - a form that she condones because the adulteress is the 60ish divorced mother of three and the 'victim' is the pretty young 2nd marriage gal that the husband of the 60ish woman left her for and so that must be some kind of justice....Make sense? Well it seems so to Meyers whose long string of 'feminist movies' (Father of the Bride I & II, Something's Gotta Give, The Holiday, What Women Want, The Parent Trap, etc) writes in her script. The story here is a rather silly overlong joke about the affair between a divorced man and woman, with a family of kids thrown in for comments, and a gaggle of chatty girlfriends who make the situation seem palatable. But 'IT'S COMPLICATED' works on one level: Meryl Streep takes on yet another role that challenges her to step into a character and make her credible and as usual she is a delight to watch. She is aided by Alec Baldwin as her ex-husband/lover and Steve Martin as a wannabe boyfriend. Streep's peppery gaggle of girlfriends have most of the entertaining chatter - especially fine work from Rita Wilson, Mary Kay Place, and Nora Dunn. But in the end the plot seems to waste good talent. Nancy Meyers may be doing the Feminist Movement more harm than good. Grady Harp",It's Complicated
21,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: It's Complicated,7,10 January 2010,"While having dinner with a friend the other night, I had unwittingly eavesdropped (well the tables were so close) on the table of two girls beside ours, talking about how their friend's fiancé failed to get a ring to propose that was worth 3 months of his salary. Who makes these rules anyway? And it is these crazy social (if I may call it that) rules that you'll hear more of in the film, that makes it quite the chuckle on one hand, and also bewildering on the other, that writer-director Nancy Myers takes massages into the narrative . It's Complicated, indeed.This is not about proposals or costs of rings, but about social stigma and expectations that creep up on couples no matter how young or old they are. The story gets set years after a couple's divorce, stemming primarily from the husband's infidelity, though all of the stakeholders can still get on in quite civil terms. You know the classic tale where husband leaves wife for a hotter, younger, better proportioned woman that gets complicated (that has to be to self-fulfil its title) when the new wife runs off, gets pregnant with someone else's child, and comes back to the man again. And the man now harbours thoughts about getting back together again with his ex-wife because his current one is driving him nuts no thanks to that generation gap, and the constant pressure for him to perform, sexually that is.Yes don't be a prude, because some of the best lines and scenes stem from the sexually charged ones, that may raise plenty of eyebrows at how daringly comical it can actually become. I think it's one of the first chick flick films that I watched with a full house of women of all ages, and there was actual clapping and lap slapping during moments of hilarity. Much of the credit goes to the strength of Nancy Myer's story, which just sprawls and yet her direction managed to keep a tight rein on the narrative pace, though there were a number of disposable characters introduced whom you think might last the distance but conveniently dropped in the first act after they tell the audience how to react, that having an affair with your ex-husband is not that wrong a wrong, especially sweet when you have a chance to get back at the woman who used to be the third party.Meryl Streep continues in her reel occupation as a chef, and as an elderly woman whose children have all grown up, she finds herself lonely despite being successful in her career. This meant an opportunity to re-enter the dating scene especially with a potential Mr Available in Architect Adam (Steve Martin in an unfunny, serious role where laughter only comes when he's puffing a joint), only to find herself falling back, albeit physically, in good terms with her ex-husband Jake (Alec Baldwin who really has piled on the kilos). It feels a little bit wrong where a divorce and breakup doesn't seem all that permanent, and worse of all having to find oneself rediscovering all the positive points during the times where things were still rosy. I particularly liked a point of discussion with a very interesting school of thought that all of an ex-couple's differences might be gone over time like a push of the delete button, that the relationship will be relegated to just ordinary friends, and like friends, can pick up from where you last left off, paving the way for a reconciliation.In some ways, this senior citizen love story ponders upon the What Ifs about the ones whom we had unwittingly allowed to go, and it's quite pro-family as well with its scenes of a wonderful family if it had chosen to stick together, to regret forsaking everything for a moment of folly that one has to live with. In fact, Nancy Meyers succeeds in her well thought-through story in making you want to root for Streep's Jane and Jake to put aside their differences and get together, despite knowing what each did to the other through their reminiscence of the past. Both actors also bring plenty to the table with their excellent performances, and always never too shy to play up on the physical effects of aging too (check out Streep's left eyebrow!)Nonetheless it's chick flick territory through and through, but weaved with agreeable, enlightening even, concepts that could be grasped by anyone who are currently in, have been or will be in a relationship. Just lighten up on those illogical, unwritten rules, that would really make things too complicated, for nothing.",It's Complicated
22,namashi_1,Fairly Entertaining... Streep is amazing...,6,26 February 2010,"Written & Directed by Nancy Meyers 'It's Complicated' is a fairly entertaining fare, with Streep coming up with an amazing performance. 'It's Complicated' starts wonderfully, loses pace in the middle completely, but picks towards it's finale.Meyers has made the film decently, a story of a divorced couple & a new man in the former spouse's life. The idea is heard, but the execution is quite different, sure it predictable, but not completely. Meyers has done her job well as a director, as a writer, she is not at her best. The film loses pace right after Streep goes to the shrink & agrees to his advice, the climax, however manages to your attention.In the acting front, Streep, is amazing, as ever! Steve Martin is fantastic, he delivers such a natural performance from start to end. Alec Baldwin is terrific, especially in the finale. Lake Bell does a fine job. Others are adequate.Watch this flick... if your a die-hard Streep, Martin & Baldwin. Otherwise, nah, your not missing any milestone.",It's Complicated
23,Smells_Like_Cheese,If you think your love life is complicated... try watching this movie,7,2 May 2010,"Well, most of you know my hatred for romantic comedies, a constant clichéd story that is so beyond old but somehow always makes some money. But one thing that stood out to me when I saw the trailer for It's Complicated was that the cast was older and better actors and a different story. I like the grown up romantic comedies, not to mention that it's rated R, so we have more realistic situations vs. a PG-13. So I saw It's Complicated tonite, I really did enjoy this movie. I liked how grown up it was and how a relationship isn't always as black and white as the younger generation likes to think it is. All the characters, even as much of a jerk like Alec Baldwin was in the movie, everyone is pretty likable in some manner. Especially Steve Martin who I just fell in love with and was very possibly the most realistic character ever written for a romantic comedy. The story is handled with maturity and has some really great laughs as we discover the way that some relationships can be so complicated.Jane is a self-reliant divorcée who owns a successful bakery. After 10 years of separation and three grown children, she finally achieves a good relationship with her ex-husband Jake, a successful attorney who has remarried the much-younger Agness. Jane and Jake attend their son Luke's college graduation in New York. A dinner together develops into an affair, making Jane ""the other woman"". Part of Jane knows it is wrong, since Jake and Agness are still married and trying to have a baby; the other part of Jane relishes being ""the other woman"" and continues the affair with Jake. Jake is just enjoying the clandestine sex and doesn't show much interest in Jane's growth as a person. He however feels nostalgic for the family life he once had with Jane, particularly her cooking, and being close with his children, and wonders if he should be growing old with Jane rather than starting a new family with Agness. Complicating matters is Adam, an architect hired to remodel Jane's home, who is himself healing from a divorce of his own, and who has begun to fall in love with Jane. He spends time getting to know her as a person, eventually falling in love with Jane as well.I have divorced parents, so one of the things I appreciated was how they addressed the adult kids trying to deal with their parents playing this mysterious affair with each other. I'm also so glad that it didn't end on a typical cliché, but I don't want to spoil it too much. The performances are really great in the movie as well, Meryl looks as lovely as ever and always plays her charismatic charm so well. Her chemistry with Alec and Steve was very on key, almost making you wish she could have both of them in her life romantically. Alec played his character very well, I felt that his character got more from a forbidden affair than him just missing his ex. Some people are naturally like that, he wanted a bunch of good feelings back and he got that with Meryl realizing that maybe the wife he has currently isn't what was expected. Steve Martin is just fantastic and such a pleasure to watch. The film is made pretty well and I'd say the story came across very clear as you can have your own conclusions why some people need closure to a relationship and how they handle it and why. For that reason, I recommend It's Complicated for the grown up's, for those who are looking for the mature romantic comedy.7/10",It's Complicated
24,blanbrn,A good romantic funny comedy that feels good and comes off as a tease of middle aged porn.,8,30 December 2009,"""It's Complicated"" is surely one funny movie that most will enjoy especially those who are middle aged as that's the age group of the films central characters. It's written and directed sharply by the queen of romantic adult comedies Nancy Meyers as here it's different from her other films the scenes and script pushes the envelope some as you feel your getting teased with middle age porn! All along enjoying every minute of it as it's a crazy laugh out loud good time! Jane(Meryl Streep who shows her range as an actress)is a middle aged woman who's divorced and she feels a little bit lonely especially in the bedroom and at an outdoor party she runs into her ex-husband Jake(Alec Baldwin)who's now with a second wife a much younger and hot sexy lady named Agness(Lake Bell). Even though divorced for a decade both Jane and Jake are on pleasant terms with one another. The two when away from California meet up at their son's graduation in New York with other family, and after a night of conversation and wine drinking at the bar old memories are rekindled and an unexpected twist occurs as they are once again bedfellows! After this night of mind blowing sex both Jane and Jake carry on an affair that's very hidden as both are living for the return to hot lust and passion. It makes you the viewer wonder if the passion is so good why didn't the marriage last, it just shows love is so complicated! Along the way as the lust adventure is carried out much of the script is a laugh out loud cheer and many of the scenes tease us with sights of middle aged porn! Along the way to make matters complex Jane's male friend her architect Adam(Steve Martin)who's a goofy overgrown nerd type of a fellow wants a relationship with her. And the chemistry and interaction of scenes involving the big three of Alec, Meryl, and Steve is in top form even if their characters actions are so funny as the trio is tangled up in this love triangle mess.Really this picture is a feel good time of middle aged drama as it pokes fun at being over the hill and aging yet it still proves folks of that age can have a good feel good time. The film teases us as mentioned, yet most of all it teaches us that like life love and relationships are very complex. All of this is made watchable by the good trio performances of Alec, Meryl, and Steve as they proved even though ""It's Complicated"" things could still feel good and be funny in the process.",It's Complicated

26,lasttimeisaw,It's Complicated,6,5 April 2012,"I intentionally gave this film a miss as I have a hunch it is not my cup of tea after Nancy Meyers's previous THE HOLIDAY 2006 (a 6/10) is so tepidly stale, which has offset all the asset which radiates from SOMETHING'S GOTTA GIVE 2003 (an 8/10). Then after a dense series of Febiofest cinema attending, I was crying out for a light comedy, even a middle-aged chick flick and there is Meryl Streep, what's the worst that could happen? With a preconceived idea that she is too smart for the dumber role she portrays in the film, finally there is a film even the omnipotent Meryl Streep could not save (entirely). Although everything in the film is too high-class to be realistic for ordinary divorced ugly- ducklings, It'S COMPLICATED seems to tell us that the complexity is not because it encompasses a classic love-triangle plight, but the true fountainhead lies within a woman's volatile strain of her emotions, which capriciously spawns doubt, sentiment and other spin- offs, which also are the staples of what is made of a woman, an advice to heterosexual men, unless you have a master degree in womanology, you will never completely understand a woman, the only feasible alternative is to set your own threshold bar there and find one which could match the criterion and endure everything hereafter. It may sound pungent, but judging by the information the film is spreading, it is what I get from my 2 hours therapy time. Meryl Streep is in her best shape considering her actual threescore age and taking on a leading role in a successful rom-com, a miracle will not repeat itself (though Diane Keaton went further in SOMETHING'S GOTTA GIVE, with a Oscar nomination!), but her character is constantly in a stasis of self-denying and playing hard-to-get, which hamstrings her from presenting some full-blown range of her knack to jostle with her two co-stars an almost 10-year-old younger Alec Baldwin (an immature boyish man in his fifties with a doggy pretentiousness) and a Botox- wrecked comedian Steve Martin (whose static forehead and creepily synthetic smile may curtail his subsequent career, he and Renee Zellweger may share more common topic!).",It's Complicated
27,sddavis63,A Strong Cast And Funny Story Make This A Winner,8,15 February 2010,"Divorce - and getting on with life after divorce - is a complicated thing for everyone who's involved - a point this movie makes very well, and which does so in a humorous way. You would expect this to be a good movie. It features three solid veteran actors - Meryl Streep and Alec Baldwin as the divorced (for 10 years) Jake and Jane, and Steve Martin as Adam, a sudden and unexpected romantic interest in Jane's life. Jake has remarried to a much younger woman, but starts to realize that the grass was greener with Jane, and the two begin an affair, with Jane suffering guilt at suddenly being the other woman, and Adam popping up as someone she might be genuinely interested in.This movie started off rather slowly, I thought, but once it gets rolling it's really very funny. The scene in which Jake quietly enters Jane's bedroom and lies naked on the bed waiting for her to return, not realizing that she's just momentarily excused herself from a webcam conversation with Adam (who can now see Jake in all his glory) is hilarious, and also worth watching were the reaction scenes from Harley (John Krasinski), soon to be Jane and Jake's son-in-law, as he sees the two of them sneaking into a hotel room together to continue their tryst and tries to prevent his fiancé (their daughter) from seeing them. Watching everyone struggle with the complicated relationships that are evolving throughout the movie is often funny, and sometimes even a bit sad - particularly when the secret about Jake and Jane's affair comes out to their unsuspecting kids. What makes this even more interesting is that there's an air of reality (or at least plausibility) to this. It's the sort of thing that could happenAs you would expect for a movie with such a strong cast, this is definitely a winner. 8/10",It's Complicated
28,Buddy-51,uneven script buoyed by fun performances,6,22 July 2010,"Nancy Meyers makes smart, funny romantic comedies for thinking adults. Her 2003 ""Something's Gotta' Give,"" with Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson, was a near-classic of the genre. Though her latest, ""It's Complicated,"" with Meryl Streep and Alec Baldwin, is nowhere near as good as that earlier film, it still manages to tickle the funny bone (from time to time) while providing us with a chance to watch some of Hollywood's most seasoned players still performing at the peak of their power.Like Keaton, Streep plays an attractive upper-class middle-aged woman who's suffering from empty-nest syndrome and a nonexistent love life. Long divorced from the husband (Baldwin) who cheated on her, Jane has pretty much given up ever having much of a life of her own beyond her grown children and the restaurant she owns and operates in scenic Santa Barbara. Much to her amazement, however, she finds herself rekindling a romance with the very man who left her to marry a younger woman ten years earlier. Further complicating the issue is that Jane is also beginning to have feelings for an architect (Steve Martin) she's hired to help her remodel her house.As in too many romantic comedies, Meyers' characters live in a squeaky-clean, white-bread world of magazine-layout homes, upscale restaurants, pricey therapy sessions, and endless wine-sipping. And there are times when the cutesiness does get a bit out of hand, particularly in the giggly, you-go-girl scenes between Jane and her requisite bevy of gossipy girlfriends (including an underused Mary Kay Place), who relate their latest romantic escapades all the while bemoaning just what cads men as a whole are. And the secondary characters - mainly the divorced couple's three children and their too-good-to-be-true son-in-law - aren't particularly well developed or played (this includes John Krasinski and Hunter Parrish, who are both much better in ""The Office"" and ""Weeds,"" respectively).But Streep, Baldwin and Martin are so confident and relaxed and play off one another with such alacrity and skill that we're pretty much willing to forgive any and all imperfections just to be able to revel in their performances. Add to that Meyers' insights into just how complicated love and romance can be for the aging Baby Boomer set and you have the makings of a slick and enjoyable - if occasionally strained - comedy for grownups.",It's Complicated
29,Robert_duder,"It's not complicated, its just simply fun!",8,13 July 2010,"Many things could be said about It's Complicated. It is the furthest thing in many ways from run of the mill comedy. The cast is made up of slightly older than middle age comedians behaving uncommonly like mid-twenties adults. It's fun to watch 'older' actors not play Grandparents, or crippled, aged people and instead vivacious, funny, lively friends. Its what made Golden Girls so amazing for so many years. All of this relies on the fact that the cast are just amazing both in their own accord and together. The chemistry, especially between the three primary characters, is absolutely amazing and it doesn't hurt that they are all extremely talented performers. The story is simple, straight forward even predictable in some ways but the terrific laughs, and cast hold everything together making it a really fun entertaining and mature romantic comedy.I used to think Meryl Streep was one of the over-rated actresses in history. Then I began to see her in some really great roles and started to see some incredible talent in her. Beyond a doubt she is incredibly versatile and Its Complicated shows off her lovable, funny, and down to earth side that makes her simply amazing to watch. She holds the whole story together and you will feel like one of her best friends throughout the film. Alec Baldwin has had a rising star for a few years now. Without a doubt the man is a hilarious comedian and working with talent like Streep and Martin only helps him feed is comedic edge. Him and Streep are terrific together and his smooth talking, one liners and sarcasm work perfectly. His character is almost a little sleazy and yet you can't help but love the guy. Steve Martin has always been one of my favourite comedians and sometimes he gets some poor roles but he is truly terrific in this film. He is almost the straight man to Streep and Baldwin but still has some really great moments. He is also the 'likable' guy in the love triangle. John Krasinski should have been used more because he is just awesome as the concerned, and hair brained son-in-law. He proves he has a big career ahead of him in sensible comedies like this. Lake Bell is good as the young wife Baldwin left Streep for. She is meant to be disliked and in that aspect she does well and you enjoy them making fun at her expense. Caitlin Fitzgerald, and Zoe Kazan play Baldwin and Streep's children and are decent but mostly just share minor screen time. The cameos from Streep's best friends are also fun to see including Rita Wilson (Tom Hanks' wife.)Plenty has been said about writer and director Nancy Meyers. She tells a really terrific story and she tells a story without gratuitous sex or language. She also brings a lot of emotion and heart felt life experience to her stories. She penned two of my favourite light hearted films also featuring Steve Martin Father of The Bride 1 and 2. She really is the perfect director for so called 'Chick Flicks.' Its Complicated is a perfect date movie hence where its success comes from. Girls will love the romance, the strong female, and the fun quirky humour and guys will love Baldwin's womanizing, wise cracking, family man. Both will love Steve Martin. So do yourself a favour and check out a comedy that doesn't blow you away nor will it bore you for a single moment. 8/10",It's Complicated

Her ex-husband, lawyer Jake (Alec Baldwin) had cheated on her, with a younger woman whom he eventually married, leaving her to begin anew. Now a successful bakery owner, Jane still runs into Jake at events hosted by friends and family. Thus, when their youngest child, a son, is set to graduate from a New York City university, they all end up staying at the same hotel. At dinnertime, Jane goes downstairs, solo, to eat but must wait for a table at the bar. Guess who's already there drinking? Why, Jake, of course. Seems his wife's son, Pedro, got the flu and he is in Manhattan alone. Jake begins showering Jane with a bevy of compliments and the two order libation after libation. In the morning, the two former spouses wake up TOGETHER, after a night of passion. Uh-oh. Flying back to California, a confused Jane doesn't know what to think and relates her experiences to her closest pals (Mary Kay Place, Rita Wilson, and Alexandra Wentworth). They are glad she is ""sleeping with someone"" but wonder about the choice. Is this a one and only encounter? No! Jake pursues Jane, once again, and the two begin an affair. Naturally, Jane is torn-up inside, for this is the man who did her wrong and she is participating in an adulterous situation. Yet, has Jake changed? Is there really a possibility for a future between them? In the meanwhile, Jane has been so successful professionally that she is remodeling her home and her place of business. The main architect, Adam (Steve Martin) scores big points when his designs are the cat's meow. Ironically, Adam shows interest a personal interest in Jane, also, and they go on a first date, after Jake fails to show up for a rendezvous with Jane. To ease the dating jitters, Jane offers Adam a joint and they get a bit stoned and slap-happy. Yes, it's complicated all right. What will be the result? This is a fun film, despite its complexities, and is well-written and directed. The stars, too, Streep, Baldwin, Martin, John Krasinski, and all of the others are truly delightful in their ""naughty"" roles. Thus, humor is abundantly on display. However, there are some who will undoubtedly cringe at a mirthful take on infidelity while others will object to the idea that drinking and drugging are what it takes to ""have a good time"" in life. Nevertheless, the movie is still very funny and thought-provoking, with an unexpected finale. If you love romantic comedies or any of the cast members, do see this one.

33,tabuno,The Frothy Foam of Relational Dynamics,8,16 January 2019,"25 August 2013. It's not Meryl Streep's finest nor most versatile performance even though she was nominated for a Golden Globe. Nor would one say that this movie shines and stands way above the rest even though it was won as best ensemble by the National Board of Review. It really didn't receive a lot of such award nominations or wins. Nevertheless while Streep's performance might not be considered brilliant or fantastic (see Bridges of Madison County, 1999; Prime, 2005; The Devil Wears Prada, 2006; Mama Mia!, 2008; Julia & Julia 2009), her performance was solid. And even the ensemble performance really came together and added to idea that the sum is greater than the sum of its parts. This ultimately did become a family affair (pun not intended). Steve Martin needs to be given credit for playing the straight man in this movie. And Alec Baldwin continues to show off his ability to tackle the comedic performance.Perhaps this movie's greatest weakness if one were to call it that was that it didn't hit the highest or dramatic, emotive notes and overall relegates itself to the mass-audience entertainment side. Yet it dealt with the complications of divorce more extensively than most movies, but the comedy and lightness still permitted this movie to skirt some of the deepest of authentic issues. Other comedy-dramas that engage even in more bolder, artistic terms would be The Perfect Man (2005), Uptown Girls (2003), Beautiful (2000), Lost in Yonkers (1993), The Weatherman (2005), Riding in Cars with Boys (2001), Little Miss Sunshine (2006), Georgia Rule (2007), Nanny Diaries (2007), and The Women (2008).",It's Complicated

35,Turfseer,"Moving, mature exploration of ex-couples' second shot at romance",8,5 July 2010,"'It's Complicated's clever opening scene introduces us to Jane and Jake who are attending an anniversary party for old friends and appear to be married. But soon Jake is joined by his sexy younger wife, Agness, and we realize Jane is the odd woman out. To make matters worse, her youngest daughter (Jane has four grown children) is now moving out of the nest and Jane is all alone in the house. Her children are concerned for her but she reassures them that she'll be fine. Jane pours herself into her work and when the head of the architectural firm comes by with new blueprints for an addition to Jane's house, she's not listening when he introduces her to Adam who actually is the project manager, responsible for all the new designs. Finally, Jane meets with a bunch of her lady friends who urge her to start dating again.The break into 'Act 2' occurs when Jane and Jake are booked in at the same hotel to attend their youngest son's graduation from college. When Jake's hyperactive son from his second marriage takes ill, Jake finds himself at the hotel alone. The estranged couple suddenly find themselves opening up after all these years over a series of drinks. Streep and Baldwin are at the top of their game as they become more and more inebriated, leading to their first sexual encounter since their divorce. We see the aftermath of said encounter with Jake admitting that he had a great time but with Jane expressing her doubts (not to mention barfing in the bathroom after having one too many). Note how Streep is hunched over the toilet bowl and we suddenly cut to the college commencement, a great little edit. I also loved how the sensitivity of the characters are brought out—Jane whistles as the youngest son appears in his cap and gown but suddenly bursts into tears (with Jake glancing at her); later it's Jake's turn to get all sensitive while eating dinner with Jane and all the children. He praises Jane and admits that he wasn't there emotionally for the kids. He gets all misty-eyed but the son urges him to 'pull himself together'. Jake caresses Jane with his foot under the table, expressing his continued interest in her. The children make it harder for Jane by admitting that it's so nice to have the family all together again.After the graduation is over, Jane fails to respond to Jake's emails so he comes over to her house and begins making a pitch for her again. He's full of witty lines such as ""life is short"" and ""people in nursing homes with plants live longer"" and she responds by stating that she never realized what a good lawyer he was. More witty lines and situations: Jake says this is ""very French of us""; Jane reveals to her friends she's having an 'affair' with ""Agness Adler's husband""--and her friends squeal with delight! At first the affair has a positive effect on Jane's mood; an employee asks ""what did you do to your hair"" and she orders him to ""change the breakfast menu"".Things eventually begin to go sour when Jake gets jealous over Jane's interest in Adam. Before you know it, Jake is spying on Jane and Adam as they have an innocent date at Jane's home. Perhaps the weakest part of the movie is Steven Martin's character. He's such a dour, wussy guy due to his inability to get over his divorce that wonders what Jane sees in him at all. Most of the scenes of Jane and Adam's burgeoning romance are slow-moving until things pick up when the two end up getting stoned on marijuana at son Luke's graduation party. Agness notes that Jake and Jane are unusually close as they dance together and this leads to the second act crisis where Jake splits up with his second wife. Interspersed between the graduation party scene and Jake showing up at Jane's home, begging to be taken back by her, is that unnecessary, long-winded encounter between Jane and Adam, preparing a batch of chocolate croissants.Things get back on track with Jake's revelation that he's left Agness and the children are all in tears as they can see their father is cracking up. They pressure Jane into letting their father stay over, even though she knows it's not a good idea. Note the wonderful transition between Jake in tears, the kids' emotional reaction and Jake at the dinner table, completely comfortable in the family setting, gorging himself on a sumptuous meal.I found the scene leading to the climax, where Jake parades himself butt naked in front of Jane's laptop, thus temporarily shattering Adam's dreams of a relationship with Jane, to be a bit over the top. But everything after that works oh so well. Jane and Jake's children reaction after they learn of their parents' affair is perfect: they all drive off, leaving Jane staring up at the rustling leaves in the trees, as she falls asleep on the couch. And then Jane pulls herself together the next and goes over tor reassure her children that she needed to ""experiment"" to see if there was any 'spark' left between her and Jake. She reveals the spark isn't there anymore and with her honesty with the children, Jane restores the trust between them and herself.The conclusion is poignant: Jake is waiting for Jane back at her home and they have one last conversation on the swing. Jane sums it all up when she acknowledges that they both ""blew it the first time around"". Jake finally faces the reality that Jane has moved on. The heartfelt theme of the movie becomes manifest: in order to grow, people sometimes must change, which also may involve some kind of loss.",It's Complicated
36,Chris Knipp,It's not complicated enough,6,26 December 2009,"'It's Complicated' is a pleasant enough romantic comedy, but it goes nowhere; a minor flaw, perhaps, for some fans of the two accomplished stars. A long-divorced couple (Meryl Streep and Alec Baldwin) gets back together for a fling, much to the confusion of their four young adult kids. Along the way the entry of another eligible divorced man doesn't so much complicate things as merely absorb our attention and avoid going deep into the many layered feelings a couple might indeed feel upon reuniting after ten years apart, allowing the glitzy Hollywood ""Nora Ephron lite"" romantic comedy trappings -- the flashy cars, the too-perfect houses, the well-off people -- to bathe us in their poshness.Baldwin left Streep for a younger woman a decade ago, but he's sick of his new wife's obsession with getting pregnant and her little kid is a pain in the neck. Meryl giggles a lot, gets high, goes along with the huffing and puffing of full-of-himself Alec, who keeps turning up for sex and baring his hairy chest. Apparently in this great reunion he hasn't thought very far beyond worry-free sex. Then along comes a sweet architect, a lonely divorced person like Meryl, played by Steve Martin. But Martin is miscast. He initially seems gay. Even toward the end when he declares that it didn't feel right with Meryl, I thought he was going to say it was because he preferred men. There's some conventional farce that works okay, notably a sequence where Meryl and Alec's secret tryst in a hotel is accidentally observed by their eldest son (the able and game John Krasinski of 'Away We Go'), and a graduation party for their younger boy (twinky Hunter Parrish) when Meryl, Alec, and Steve all get hilariously and hugely stoned on new, high grade weed they're not used to. As the younger daughter the many-coiffed Zoe Kazan gets short, straight blond hair this time; but except for Krasinski, the kids are just interchangeable pawns on the board.At the center of things is Meryl, the white queen, a woman who's got her own chic bakery business (a downgrade from playing Julia Child) and, thanks to Hollywood, lives in a house worth many millions whose kitchen is so perfect it's hard to figure out why Steve Martin has to come in to design an addition making it much bigger -- for a lady whose last child is now going away to college.Nancy Meyers is known for relationship comedies that gently satirize men and provide some laughs. Previous successes are 'What Women Want' (2000) and 'Something's Gotta Give' (2003); in success level this one rates somewhere between these two. Polished stuff; but this time the finale is pretty weak, and not so much complicated as simply muddled and inconsequential, much ado about nothing. The only resolution is that the new addition to Meryl's house is still going to get built, and Steve Martin is still on the job, even if none of the dating worked out. This sugary fluff opened, appropriately, on Christmas Day. What you can say is that Baldwin holds his own as an attention-getter opposite Streep. She seems to have pushed the giggle button and never shut it off, which makes for very little variety and seems a terrible waste of her talents after her amusing turn this year as Julia Child.",It's Complicated

It had an actual STORY. The movie is a comedy but has its serious moments too. Meryl Streep was great, Steve Martin was toned down in a support role, but the real star is Alex Baldwin whose presence props up this movie and transforms it into a good if not great cinematic work. As much as the director tries to make this movie a Meryl Streep vehicle, Mr. Baldwin steals the show. This has to be his best movie in years, maybe in his entire career. He is a combination of amusing, charming, and serious and whenever the movie starts dragging a ""dose"" of Mr. Baldwin is enough to get it back on track. What a wonderful performance by an excellent actor. Parts of the movie are hilarious, such as the bedroom scene with Ms. Streep, Mr. Baldwin and Mr. Martin (it's not what you think it is) but generally the humor tends to be at the level of chuckles instead of guffaws.

The aforementioned Meryl Streep was once again fabulosa! She stars as Jane, a successful bakery owner who has been divorced for a decade and is also a mother of three good looking kids in their early 20's. Jane rediscovers the Tarzana in her when she sexually reunites with her ex-husband Jake who is married to a younger woman now. So Jane is now ""the other woman"" and Janie like it. The plot goes into a more complicated bizarre love triangle scenario when Jane's new architect Adam craves to build a romance with Jane. Writer-Director Nancy Meyers scripted and helmed a crowd-pleasing film sure to entertain both females and males alike; see that was not so complicated. Alec Baldwin was a riot as the Jane-seeking Jake. I cannot remember such a greatly poised comedic character in film lately as the charismatic Jake. Baldwin is on target here, and is deserving of a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination. Steve Martin's character was no ""wild & crazy guy"" like the Jake character, but Martin was adequate in portraying the non-Jerk Adam. I am glad that Meyers left some office character space for John Krasinski with his motoring portrayal as Jane & Jake's soon to be son-in-law Harley.

I don't know why women find him appealing, but apparently they do. Steve Martin seemed a bit miscast as the morose divorced architect.

It is a chick flick for one, and specifically a ""mature chick"" flick. Hehe. Anyway, again it has good word of mouth, as well as awards nominations, so I watched. Jane (Meryl Streep) and Jack (Alec Baldwin) have been divorced for about 10 years. He has already married a much-younger woman. She is still single and operating a successful bakeshop. One day, they they get together for their son's graduation. Old sparks are apparently rekindled, and this encounter blows up into a full-blown affair. Will they or will they not get back together again? Truth be told, the story is really a string of unpleasant topics like divorce and adultery. The use of drugs was employed to buoy up a sagging middle. The scenes surrounding the eventual resolution of the conflicts toward the end are confusing and unsatisfying.However, this film was carried mainly by the goodwill of its talented star cast. Meryl Streep can really do no wrong. She was radiant and carefree in this movie. Alec Baldwin plays the cad husband with so much likability that you even wind up rooting for him. His nude scene with the laptop is really ""laugh-out-loud"" funny! I like the character of Steve Martin as Adam, the architect smitten by Jane's charms and chocolate croissants. This is the Steve Martin in his ""Parenthood"" mode which I like. John Krasinski is the funny son-in-law to be. His scene with the pajamas is downright hilarious! Director Nancy Myers again comes up with another film about the female psyche, driven by its main female protagonist, like her previous output ""The Holiday"" and ""Something's Got to Give"". While the script may be a little problematic, the film remains to be watchable and likable because of the wonderful star performances.

Alec begins to feel attracted to Streep again, and after a night of drinking and dancing the two wind up in bed having the time of their lives, which soon becomes a regular thing (and an all-out marital affair in Baldwin's case). It seems that being divorced has been just the shot in the arm this couple has needed to rekindle their feelings for the past decade. Also muddled into the mix (and making the title of this movie hold up) is that Streep is having her house re-done by a nice-guy architect (Steve Martin)who's starting to fall for her. There are some good laughs here, and Alec Baldwin kind of takes top honors, I thought.

This middle-brow 2009 romantic triangle farce is no exception as it showcases Meryl Streep as Jane, the successful, late-fiftyish owner of a Santa Barbara boutique patisserie and the mother of three grown children. A decade after her divorce, she still has a congenial relationship with her ex-husband Jake who in true Hollywood-cliché style, left her to marry a much younger woman with abs of steel and a bratty five-year-old. As an empty-nester trying to get used to youngest daughter Gabby going off to college, Jane succumbs to Jake's charms in the bar of a New York hotel where the ex-spouses are staying to attend their son's college graduation.Their alcohol-infused one-night-stand kick-starts the predictable comedy hi-jinks with Jane's more-recently-divorced architect Adam thrown in the mix for good measure. Considering the star wattage involved, I was surprised how bored I was with the ensuing shenanigans despite the crack comic performances of Streep and Alec Baldwin as the smitten-again Jake. The first problem is that the movie feels overlong at 121 minutes with a slow set-up and an even more gradual wrap-up unfortunately peppered with a sitcom-level, ""Three's Company""-style episode involving a webcam. The second problem is casting Steve Martin, surgically altered and looking like a waxwork, as Adam, a role that begs for flashes of his old wild-and-crazy persona but ends up being a persistent milquetoast who hardly seems romantic rival enough for the far more vibrant and impulsive Jake. Even Martin's brief moment of comic glory during the pot-smoking scene is stolen by Streep's more natural, free-wheeling style.The rest of the cast is given short shrift in Meyers' belabored screenplay with Lake Bell in the woefully underwritten role of Jake's predictably curt wife and the young actors playing Jane's children - Caitlin Fitzgerald, Hunter Parrish and Zoe Kazan – particularly unctuous and irritating. However, John Krasinski (""Away We Go"") shines in the minor role of eldest daughter Lauren's affable husband who unexpectedly discovers the affair between Jane and Jake in an amusingly slapstick fashion. John Toll's crisp, lifestyle-magazine-style cinematography makes the movie feel like an extended Food Network program. The 2010 DVD offers just one significant extra, a decent feature-length audio commentary track with Meyers, Toll, executive producer Suzanne Farwell, and editor Joe Hutshing. Perhaps unsurprisingly, none of the principals participated.",It's Complicated

It is a very enjoyable, funny, and at times, hilarious movies that captures the audience's interest, that brings us back to the good old feelings that were so popular in the 30's and 40's when screwball and the art of comedy was at its best. This film might have been a feasible option in the 30's. It has the right ingredients: a series of misunderstandings, likable characters, a funny comedy of errors, some priceless genuine comedic acting, and most important, real chemistry among its main players.In a nutshell, a divorced couple find a way to revive the spark and the love that brought them together in the happier times. Meryl and Alec have done some very good work comedic work before; what wasn't expected is how good they are when they are work together. We really believe they were a real couple, with a background history, with strong ties, and in this storyline, real physical attraction. Meryl gives, as expected, a marvelous, well rounded performance, but the most astounding surprise is how well Baldwin matches her note by note, and how expressive his face really is. We read enthusiasm, regret, love, tenderness, and some wacky emotions along the way. They can also play naughty quite nicely.There is some amazing support by Krazinsky and to a point, Martin, in an underdeveloped part. Overall, the film is bound to earn a spot among some of the most entertaining films ever made. There are some classic bits here, and just like ""Mamma Mia"", it provides the audience with lighthearted, hilarious fun. There are scenes where a touch of depth is thrown in to resolve the story and the fates of the main couple, and it is not preachy or forced. There is some honesty in them. What takes away from turning this into an instant classic is the problematic ending. Without going into details, many members in the audience appeared as puzzled as I was because, even though real life has strange ways of dealing with situations like these, it appeared as if the level of satisfaction wasn't what it should have been. Personally, the resolution bothered me, and the question I pose is: Did it bother you, too? It is not the worst ending, but it wasn't the best either...",It's Complicated

The plot is formulaic, the characters are one dimensional and the humour is hit-and-miss, yet somehow the female counterpart to Richard Curtis ensures you leave the cinema not thinking you wasted your hard earned cash. I suppose her previous directing experience – What Women Want, The Holiday, Something's Gotta Give, the latter two she is also wrote – has taught her a thing or two about romcoms.When focussing on the laughs Meyers has some success, the leading trio along with Krasinski (playing the son-in-law) have natural comic timing that ensures even the mediocre jokes draw a smile to your face. However, when the drama takes front and centre in the second half the film halts with a splatter; the last act that ties up all the loose ends is especially dull and tiresome. It's a shame about the mood shift because when the chuckles are no longer on offer the flaws become much more evident.Despite having only cardboard cut-outs to work with, the experience of Streep, Baldwin and Martin combined is enough to gloss over the lack of depth afforded their characters. Streep's Jane is given a hint of insight, the most of any them, and the greatest actress of our generation fills the rest with her undisputed talent and likability. Surprisingly Martin isn't given many opportunities to stretch his rib-tickling muscles as Adam, the bulk of those going to Baldwin in a standout performance as the ebullient Jake – a 58 year old man with the energy, and libido, of a 16 year old.This film has no right to be watchable, but unexplainably, it is.3 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)",It's Complicated

The sparks are re-ignited but David is married to someone half- his age. Nancy Meyers has been known for her feel-good romantic comedies and believe me most of the time it works. There is something about her writing, direction and screenplay which makes you feel romantic. Especially the background music by Hans Zimmer adds more soothing effects. As far as performances are concerned, what can be said about Meryl Streep. The legendary actor is so natural that it is difficult to pin point any flaws in her acting. Alec Baldwin does his part as a losser-want to- win-over his wife once again with utmost honesty. Steve Martin is serious this time and he is actually good.

53,Likes_Ninjas90,It's Complicated does not live up to its hype and the enormity of its advertising campaign. It just isn't as funny or as sharply satirical as it could have been,5,26 January 2010,"A woman named Jane (Meryl Streep) has been divorced for a number of years, and in the wake of children growing up and moving away from her, she is now living on her own. She is still bitter about her divorce from Jake (Alec Baldwin), a lawyer who cheated on her and is now married to a much younger woman in Agnes (Lake Bell). Jake is unhappy with his marriage and the fact that Agnes is insisting on having another child, even though he is a lot older now. At a bar though Jake spots Jane and they are reacquainted by drinking and then eventually sleeping together. Jake convinces Jane that they should continue this affair but he takes this as an opportunity to try and bring their marriage back together. Jane becomes torn between this adventurous affair and with her emotions for her architect, the much nicer Adam (Steve Martin), who is helping to redesign her house.One of director Nancy Meyer's most well known films was Something's Gotta Give, a smart and sometimes funny romantic comedy for adults. Jack Nicholson played a man dating a much younger woman but then having to come to terms with his own age and eventually start dating her mother. It's Complicated, which Meyer's also wrote the screenplay for, covers somewhat similar territory in that Jane is the mature woman who has been overlooked for a much younger and sexier wife, but then gets her revenge by stealing back her husband. Yet disappointingly, this film lacks a dramatic arch for the comedy to exist within. The affair is one that is taken as some fun, an adventure to provide pleasure, with Janes girlfriends cheering when she announces her revelation. Eventually she does begin to question and act upon the ethics of the situation but that is not say the film has an edge dark enough for the film the be a more satirical representation of shallow people, as opposed to just being a rather lightweight Hollywood comedy.Given the cast and the talent involved it surprising that the film is also not as funny as one would expect it to be. Meyer's direction is mundane, not only because the pace of the film is sluggish and lumbering towards its second hour, but also because she relies solely on the performances of the actors, as opposed to juxtaposing scenes for irony, employing sight gags, or anything visually inventive. The script is rarely able to provide the actors with sharp and witty dialogue that can demonstrate their comic timing of the finest touch. Streep is arguably the most diverse, talented and successful actress in Hollywood at the moment, but she is rarely given the time to express her internal emotions as much as her external ones. It is only in the early scenes of the film, with her children leaving, that one is given a hint of her isolation. Baldwin is not particularly challenged here either, despite his efforts to remove his hard man persona in favour of someone more charming. Jane's children are particularly irritating as well, too old to still be whining about their parent's and how weird the reunion seems. The one really likable performance in the film though is from Steve Martin. Although he doesn't generate the laughs some might be anticipating, he brings an air of restraint to the film where the others don't. His sincerity is a breath of fresh air, bordering on a more natural and realistic performance as an architect, a builder of something significant, perhaps even in a more metaphorical sense.It's Complicated does not live up to its hype and the enormity of its advertising campaign as just isn't as funny or as sharply satirical as it could have been. The cast struggles to generate the laughs that the script cannot provide and Meyer's direction is largely flat. Had this explored much darker and serious territory it might have been a much more memorable and interesting examination of the damage an affair can bring to those physically and emotionally involved.",It's Complicated

55,moviesleuth2,Has its moments,6,2 January 2010,"Nancy Meyers is famous for tapping into a largely ignored market: middle-aged women. She acknowledges that women don't cease to exist after they grow older than Jessica Alba (anyone older than that loses their sex appeal in the eyes of movie studios, and that's the only thing that keeps audiences interested in these sorts of movies).I am not a member of this market. However, I am open to movies to which I am not a targeted member. That, and I love Meryl Streep. I have seen Nancy Meyers' previous effort, ""Something's Gotta Give,"" a movie that started out okay, but ended up being an overlong disaster that I hated. Still, this movie sounded promising, especially with Streep, who has never made a bad movie, so I checked it out. While it is certainly better than ""Something's Gotta Give,"" it is nowhere near a complete success.Jane (Meryl Streep) is a divorced mother of three, and an empty nester. Years after her divorce, she's finally gotten her life back together (or at least she thinks she does). However, her life is going to get a little...complicated. Her ex, Jake (Alec Baldwin) has just realized that he is still in love with Jane, and they ensue in an affair (which, ironically, was one of the reasons why they divorced in the first place). At the same time, she's also attracted the attention of her architect, Adam (Steve Martin). Now Jane has to balance these two romances out, and complications ensue.Meryl Streep is widely recognized as one of the greatest actresses alive (and in my opinion, one of the best who ever lived). Yet with 13 Oscar nods, she hasn't done much in the way of comedy. She got a taste of it in last year's ""Mamma Mia,"" but with this film, she gets to do some scenes that are openly funny. And she shows everyone that she can be just as successful in a comedy as a drama. Many of the film's comic scenes wouldn't be as funny without her. Her co-stars, Alec Baldwin and Steve Martin, are no stranger to being funny, and Streep manages to keep up with them. Speaking of, Baldwin and Martin are on the same level as Streep. Baldwin is equally good in the comic scenes as well the dramatic scenes, and so is Martin (surprisingly...he hasn't gotten much chance to do drama. Hopefully, this performance will signal a change, because he's got some good dramatic chops as well as comic aptitude). Had this film been better directed, they could have been looking at some Oscar nods. Special mention has to go to John Krasinski, because even though he became famous for the ultra-understated humor of ""The Office,"" he is also great at more energetic humor too. Lake Bell has little to do than be a post-trophy wife that is often referenced, but not seen.Nancy Meyers may have tapped into the market for middle aged women, but she's only at the top because she's the only one in it. Meyers is not an especially great screenwriter or director. The dialogue is nothing special, and her direction is flat, which renders the drama more inert than it should be. The comedy only works because of the actors, not Meyers; this should be construed as a compliment to Streep, Baldwin and Martin, since the comedy is not adequately set up. Many of the plot points exist because Meyers is trying to follow the formula of ""romantic comedy,"" even if what happens doesn't make sense.If you like Meyers' films, it's a film to check out. If not, I don't think its worth your time.",It's Complicated
56,Eumenides_0,Fun Romantic Triangle,6,10 March 2010,"Nancy Meyers' latest romantic comedy brings together three wonderful actors: Meryl Streep, Alec Baldwin, and Steve Martin. With a very funny, and occasionally smart, screenplay, the three manage to make a movie that is high on laughter and isn't completely moronic like many modern attempts at comedy.The premise of the movie is quite ingenious: Jane and Jake, divorced from each other for years now, begin a secret affair after getting drunk at a casual meeting. Jane has many doubts and torments herself about how wrong it feels, but Jake, unhappily married to another woman, sees in Jane a new shot at happiness. To complicate things, Jane is falling in love with her architect, Adam.There are many stories in the movie: Jane trying to break off with Jake a second time; Jake trying to convince Jane to prolong their affair; Jane and Adam getting to know each other, which forms the tenderest part of the movie. Gluing all these subplots together are countless jokes, that go from visual gags to slapstick, to quotable one-liners, to embarrassing situations caused by the characters' own folly.In this talented and comic romantic triangle, it's hard to say who has the edge; for my part, Streep's 16 Oscar nominations notwithstanding, it's Alec Baldwin who steals the show whenever he's on screen. His little ticks and the smooth way he talks, so seductively, his complete happiness at the new freedom he's found, they're all wonderfully captured by Baldwin. His personality is easily the most memorable in the movie.Streep and Martin are pretty good too, but you can say they're the only semblance of maturity, although always light-hearted, in the movie. Whereas Baldwin represents a middle-aged man trying to recover the best years of his life, Streep and Martin show two people living in the present and willing to move on. The most touching scenes belong to them.The rest of the cast play their roles with efficiency, although you couldn't find a personality strong enough to match any of the three leads, not even if you pressed them all into one. The three actors playing Jane's kids were sometimes annoying and at times unbearable. Only John Krasinski rises above the mediocre level; with his rubbery face, always displaying emotions, and his good timing for his always-perfect one-liners, he deserves credit for bringing a lot of humor into the movie too.For anyone needing to be cheered up or wanting to spend a good time, It's Complicated is the perfect antidote.",It's Complicated
57,LazySod,Love and other painful things,6,19 January 2010,"A man and a woman. Once married, for a long time, they are now divorced. And even the divorce was initiated a long time ago. With one of their kids about to graduate they end up meeting each other again and even though one of them is now married again the unthinkable happens: they hook up. What follows is a long string of emotions leading the both of them in all directions at once.As a comedy the above premise works out as long as the turns taken are believable and the characters are played out just as believable. For the most of the film this works out - it's clear that the relation between the two of them fell apart for a reason, it's clear that the pains of the divorce are behind them, it's clear that they have both been changed forever by the combined experiences and what not. And for the most of the film the responses to actions are believable enough.But, it doesn't stay like that long enough or even often enough. The film jumps track here and there and sometimes the performances or the emotions chosen by the actors and/or script are just too tacky to depict the situation they are in, which comes across so completely unbelievable that it breaks the pace of the film and turns a comical situation into a mild irritation.Add to that a solid bit of sometimes misplaced sentiments and the result is a film that is solidly funny at some bits, and solidly irritating at others.

58,ClaytonDavis,Meyers Best...Streep sexy at 60,8,10 December 2009,"In the best work of her career Nancy Meyers presents the funny comedy, It's Complicated starring Meryl Streep, Alec Baldwin, and Steve Martin.This fast-paced, smart comedy is everything in a mature work that didn't succeed with films such as Something's Gotta Give. Meyers creates three authentic characters with sympathy and everyday qualities that make them identifiable and first-class writing genius.The film tells the story of Jane (Streep), who's ten year post-divorce from Jake (Baldwin), who left her for a much younger woman, hasn't necessarily become water under the bridge. Trying to find some type of happiness in her later years, she meets Adam (Martin), a sensitive architect, who is designing her new kitchen and has had his fair share of divorce stories in the past. But when attending their son's college graduation, Jane and Jake find that everything is as simple as it once seemed.The cast here is one of the best ensemble works of the year. Meryl Streep is naturalistic and in top form showing her sexier side at 60. Streep shows that she can still create a character from scratch and make the woman as real as anyone walking down the streets of New York City. It's one of her funnier turns in years.Alec Baldwin, in one of his best performances to date, shows immaturity and careless can get you far in a film. Showing top comedic work, Baldwin seems in the hunt for Oscar recognition. His charm and magnetism is quite surprising as we haven't seen him give a performance this funny ever, not even in his hit sitcom ""30 Rock."" Steve Martin, who I have found overdoes his comedy in some of his later years in film is in control and utterly enjoyable. Martin shows a sensitive side reminiscent of his works in Roxanne and Parenthood, and finds an audience cheer with empathetic tendencies can get you right back to what you do best. It's a return to form for Martin.John Krasinski, who plays Harley, one of Jane's daughter's fiancée, is totally hilarious and drives away from the comedy we once found funny in his ""Jim"" on NBC's hit sitcom ""The Office."" Krasinski, in many ways upstages some of the veterans on film as he steals a lot of the spotlight. Krasinski is an outstanding talent to watch out for in the near future as he branches out into more demanding roles.It's Complicated couldn't have succeeded without Nancy Meyers finally showing what good writing can do with the right people, time, and effort put into place. It's the work of her career and she remains a dark horse for an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay. Though the film will definitely appeal to an older generation, the younger can appreciate the zeal and comical dialogue shared between the players. The film does run a bit long and loses some of it's spark in the finale act, but it's pure entertainment and a must-see of the holiday season.",It's Complicated
59,richieandsam,"Not bad, but not great",6,29 January 2013,"IT'S COMPLICATEDI saw this film advertised over the Christmas period a couple of years ago... the trailer made it look like it might be quite funny.It was alright. I did enjoy it while it was on, but it was not as good as I was expecting.The story is about a divorced couple who move on with their lives after 10 years apart, but when they meet up at a party, they start to have an affair together.The casting was not as bad as i was expecting... it stars Meryl Streep, Alec Baldwin & Steve Martin.I am not a big Meryl Streep fan... she has made some good movies, but I don't see her as the legend that she seems to be. I don't think any of the Baldwins can actually act, but Alec did alright in this one. He was quite funny in places. Steve Martin...now that man is a legend. He is a great actor and plays one of the best characters in the film. But I have to say, the best character in the movie was played by John Krasinski... John played the future son in law to Meryl & Alec... He was funny. He was responsible for one of the 2 laugh out loud moments for me.The other laugh out loud moment involved Meryl, Alec, Steve, a laptop and a bed... watch it... it's really funny. :)The story was alright, the acting was quite good, the comedy could have been better.I will give this film 6 out of 10.Not bad, but not great.For more of my reviews, please like my Facebook page:http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",It's Complicated

I could relate to some of the story because these situations have happened to me. It was easy to understand the complications of the interpersonal relationships.The movie isn't brilliant and some of the material really wasn't funny or new. In fact,some of it feels like recycled material from other films. A little of this, a little of that. But then the film turns a corner and suddenly you are enjoying what you are seeing even though it didn't take all this talent to make it all happen. Honestly, Streep and Martin are wasted here. Steve Martin has done this stuff before and Meryl Streep has done better films. But, you can't hate this movie either. You want things to work out for Meryl either way. With either guy. And you sort of want everyone to be happy. Nothing is wrapped up conveniently so the scene can end. It's all up in the air and that is how relationships can be. So, don't expect a brilliant new comedy. It sort of feels like a perfectly worn in pair of old slippers.",It's Complicated

I could not drop my suspension of disbelief to enjoy personalities who I generally enjoy, but are delivering a script clearly written by and for divorced women. it's Pretentious. Yes, it must be complicated with so many choices in life. House additions just because a single empty nest mom needs more space, or how about some pot? it's ridiculous! These folks are all rich so beyond the middle class that their only accessibility is passing them in first class on the way the coach. This is actually pertinent because while our ex-partners have flights booked from their sons' graduation, the father drives him back from school. The logistics are non-existent. Our secondary comic act of a future son-in-law is likable on his own, but as comic fodder is too fricking. it's Confectionate. A comedy needs drama to ""taffy out"" the comedy and we only get one moment of good drama when Steve Martin, who is playing the ultimate sap, is video courting his girlfriend, and is literally exposed to the ex-husband who is clearly still in the picture... and Martins' character stays on line watching long enough to add comedy. it's pathetic.",It's Complicated
62,HelenMary,"a romcom for grown ups - touching, funny and uplifting",7,21 June 2013,"I had wanted to see this film for a while, was drawn to it, but expected it to run in the style of early twenty-something-type romcoms and be clichéd and mediocre; funny though, but average. I was pleasantly surprised by this film, how good it was and also how immediately immersing it was. I was gripped all the way through, not knowing how it was going to end (could guess the possible scenarios) and really enjoyed every minute of it. I caught myself halfway through fully invested in the story, the characters and the family emotions, and thinking ""wow, I'm really enjoying this film."" It's really entertaining, and rather beautiful.Meryl Streep was convincing, perfectly cast and brilliant, invisible as an actress in the role of Jane Adler, divorcée of ten years from Jake Adler (Alec Baldwin.) Steve Martin plays the other love interest, architect Adam Schaffer, the other protagonist hoping to win the hand of Jane. Baldwin was good, his delivery monotone and breathy - sexy perhaps - and very typical of him. He always plays the same and in this he's a heavier Jack Donaghy (30 Rock). I didn't find him so convincing, but loved the chemistry between him and Streep and also the family chemistry of the two of them plus the three children (well played, all) and the soon to be son in law Harley (John Krasinski) who was really likable with some real comedy moments.There were a lot of laughs in this film, and the script was great, screenplay really clever, and there wasn't really much to fault in the film. Direction, set design and location etc were amazing; the home that Jane Adler lived in was gorgeous! I want to go to there! Steve Martin was lovely, sweet, broken and in the comedy bits his typical lovable self. My only concern was what on earth has he done to his face? He looked plastic and like he was wearing a mask... which is a shame as he usually looks so fresh faced - I mention it because it was distracting sometimes in his scenes... I was looking at his face rather than at his character! Overall a lovely romcom. Suitable for most, nothing that people would find offensive unless very sensitive, despite it being an adult theme film. Really entertaining and enjoyable, well executed and engaging story. I admit, it was a lot better than I expected. Best not to watch this on an empty stomach, it's quite an epicurean delight and lovely to see the femme fatale as a glamorous beautiful over thirty-five year old for a change!",It's Complicated

It's Complicated follows the story of Jane (Streep) that during her son's graduation hooks up with her ex-husband Jake (Baldwin)and at the same time she is dating Adam, her architect. The movie has some good moments of humor but the situations tends to repeat over and over making the movie a little boring. The story is kinda predictable and the plot is a bit lame and corny but the movie is worthy because of its cast. Actors like Alec Baldwin and Steve Maritn and an actress like Meryl Streep make it a real joy. Their performances are excellent and so funny. In conclusion, It's complicated is a movie mostly intended for people over 30's and 40's. Women will love it and men will enjoy it also",It's Complicated

Steve Martin is great as Jane's architect, Adam, who falls for Jane. The supporting cast, including the three kids and John Krasinski as daughter Lauren's fiancée, Harley is especially hilarious, and provides a lot of the many moments of genuine hilarity. The film is very fun to watch but also delivers a great message about how divorced couples should be and the message on how not to let your relationships bog your life down. The film may start out too slow for some, but once the on-screen affair starts, the film never skips a beat. The demographic for this is most likely woman.

Everyone has to be filthy rich in big studio movies now, as those studios no longer do regular people stories as they only want big box office grosses that depend on the rich glamor factor now, not realism.

Steve Martin gives an understated performance and even when his character is stoned, he doesn't get up to his usual antics. It's very refreshing. And John Krasinski is quite lovable. It's the first time that I've actually paid attention to him. I'm thinking this movie is geared towards perhaps an older - and/or more... feminine - audience.

The story is simple, we have a divorced couple going through rough times in their new lives and are brought together at a family event. What happens? They find themselves oddly attracted to each other after ten years of divorce and have an, even though they are divorced and he is remarried. While the couple still maintain other romances, they cannot help but to continue with their affair.The movie does have a few good laughs and great acting by both Baldwin and Streep, with Streep trying to balance her romantic life between Baldwin who plays her ex and Martin who plays the new love interest. In general, the movie was wayyy too long given its predictability and did well to look into if people who aren't together anymore and time passes by and they have changed into the people they currently are - have they turned into the people they always wanted each other to be? Or were they always to be in a doomed relationship? The film was ordinary and couldn't buy the chemistry between Streep and Martin. The story during the middle really drags on and missed the point which makes the whole film flat which is sad as it doesn't live up to the hype it deserved. As mentioned, the pace of the film is draining and the film solely on the performances of the actors, as opposed to comparing the scenes for irony or to provide some sharp banter of how affairs can affect people on an emotional level - overall 5.5/10",It's Complicated

It is both immature and weird. Adults behaving like children - or adolescents - is what happens throughout this predictable and mind numbing experience, and is why it is so banal.The terrain of divorce and romantic/sexual love could be engaging and witty, with real adult dialog and intelligence, but Streep's Jane giggles like a little girl; she reacts to the men rather than be the agent of her life, and the male characters are like archetypes from a supermarket self help guide.There is nothing original or intelligent happening here.

Davis thought Streep had the goods; she even wrote her a letter expressing the hope that they'd work together someday. Hepburn, on the other hand, thought that Streep - with her myriad of accents - was a one-trick pony. Two Oscars and 16 nominations may have proved Davis right, but Streep also proved Hepburn right. With Prime, Mamma Mia!, Julie & Julia, and, now, It's Complicated, she has officially joined Robert DeNiro, Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, Michael Caine, Jack Nicholson, and Anthony Hopkins in The Ham Club -- great actors who have tanked their great careers to ham it up in utter dreck for big, fat paychecks!I never bought that Streep and Alec ""Thoughtless Little Pig"" Baldwin were once married, much less, parents. Neither Jane or Jake are likable: she is a self-absorbed whiner, and he is a self-absorbed creep. If self-absorbed creep Baldwin weren't so full of himself, he'd see the irony of his casting. Then again, probably not.Then there's Steve Martin as the prototypical Sad Sack. You can see him just counting the seconds until he could run back into his trailer and hide! To say Martin is horribly miscast, and that he and Streep have zero chemistry, is being charitable.Jake and Jane's children are supposedly adults, yet they act like their puppy has just died when they learn the awful truth. As Jane later explains why she and Dad were playing ""home, sweet home"" (gag!), the children are huddled together on a bed like 5 year olds on a cold winter's night! How retarded!Speaking of retarded, on what planet do shrinks advise their patients to sleep around? Seeing how Jane, an alleged baker, plays with dough (more shameless hammy by Streep), and doesn't know the first thing about making croissants, the shrink should have ordered her to go to baking school, instead!The one in this mess who does himself proud (if you can say that) is the kid who plays The Stepson From Hell. That he had me wanting to ram his bratty head through the wall is either a testament to his talent or proof that he actually is a brat. One of Jane's pals is played by Rita Wilson, whom Tom Hanks played ""home, sweet home"" (gag!) with while still playing ""home, sweet home"" (gag!) with his wife, reminding me of that old chestnut: ""If he cheats with you, he'll cheat on you.""

The cast: Alec Baldwin, Meryl Streep, Steve Martin, Rita Wilson, John Krasinski, Lake Bell are all wonderful in the film. It's comical, mild in laughs but true to what a family needs.
A divorced couple (Baldwin/Streep) have lingering feelings, un resolved issues and begin an affair of sorts even though Baldwin is married to a much younger (Bell). The ensuing comedy of covering up the affair is humorous, mild drug humor and fun to watch.

This is a very over-rated film in my opinion and although entertaining in parts, it is not entertaining enough and must rank as Streeps most disappointing movie for quite a while. As for Alec Baldwin, he needs acting rehabilitation (wrong word) and Steve Martin looks perfect as a shy architect. Great shots of the house and the plans, loved all that, got some ideas for my new kitchen but wont be following the lead on marry - divorce - maybe marry again and whatever comes afterwards. don't know much about the director, shall leave it at that, don't expect this to be in the Oscar push, unlike Streeps Julie and Julia, a different class entirely.

73,jemps918,A good romantic comedy is a rarity...,9,11 February 2010,"It's Complicated is simply enjoyable. A good romantic comedy is a rarity, so who better than rom-com specialist Nancy Meyers (The Holiday, Something's Gotta Give, What Women Want) to write and direct yet another? Jane (Meryl Streep) and Jake (Alec Baldwin) have been married for ten years and divorced for fifteen, but while attending their son's college graduation sparks fly between the old flames. But Jake's still married to the much younger Agness (Lake Bell), and Jane's architect and fellow divorceé Adam (Steve Martin) remains an interesting and sensible possibility. This puts everyone on a roller-coaster ride of what-ifs, which includes Jane and Jake's three grown kids.It's a treat to see excellent actors delivering the laughs, especially when it looks like they're having a great time, too. In particular, John Krasinski (The Office) stands out in his supporting role as Harley, Jane and Jake's future son-in-law, who accidentally finds out about the affair before everyone else. Streep shines, as usual, while Baldwin eases into his newfound role of go-to comedy guy since his career-reviving 30 Rock success. The usually slapstick Martin surprisingly turns in a more toned down performance, which is a relief.It's wonderful to see intelligent lead roles still being written for mature actors that doesn't exclude younger audiences. The story and characters have broad appeal; the dilemmas remain relevant regardless of age and so are the punch lines.

75,Irie212,Nancy Meyers and the moral bankruptcy of her vision of feminism,4,23 February 2010,"Okay, this is going to be a long review. More than any movie I've seen in recent memory, It's Complicated struck me as a disturbing commentary on American society. It is all the more revealing because the filmmaker seems unaware that her movie celebrates women who live lives of material wealth and moral poverty.I saw It's Complicated because I had just watched Summertime, David Lean's 1955 movie about adultery. So this was a chance to compare two venerable actresses in similar roles: Katharine Hepburn as a 50-ish spinster, Streep as a 60-ish divorcée-- coincidentally or not, both named Jane. There's a world of difference between being divorced and being a spinster, but both Janes are lonely women who enter brief affairs. The trouble is, there's a full universe of differences between the directors-- the supremely accomplished David Lean (who, incidentally, directed one of the finest films ever about love affairs, Brief Encounter), and one-trick-pony Nancy Meyers (chick flick). Summertime has a far better script, Hepburn's Jane is vulnerable but honorable, and the movie was entirely filmed in glorious Venice. It's Complicated, on the other hand, is an dishonorable and unfunny comedy set in Santa Barbara, which in this movie looks like it was built last year as a tribute to what money can buy.Money is practically a character in the movie. It saturates every frame. ""You've Feng-shui'd your life,"" a friend says admiringly to Jane, whose house is unmitigated Martha Stewart. Not one item in it suggests idiosyncratic or personal taste. The focus is on kitchens and bathrooms, the latter being a peculiar obsession with Americans. Bathrooms are used for dressing scenes, a private phone call scene, a marijuana scene, a puking scene, a bathtub scene. Jane even uses a bathroom to describe her feelings: she has his and hers sinks, and the his sink makes her sad. But Jane is a professional cook, so her extravagance really shows up in lavish kitchens. She already has two, in her bakery and in her home, yet she hires architect Adam (a superb Steve Martin) to build her ""dream kitchen"" as part of a whole new wing for her freshly empty nest.Jane's materialism is a symptom of her moral poverty. She claims that she's a slave to her conscience, but her conscience has the tensile strength of wet toilet paper. She sleeps with her ex, Jake (Alec Baldwin) even though he's remarried and his philandering was a major reason she divorced him. Being an adulteress bothers Jane a bit-- though not enough to actually end it. Quite the opposite, in fact. She giggles about the adultery at her kaffee klatsches. She coyly encourages Jake, who at one point even says to her, ""Is it really necessary for you to always say no before you say yes?"" She laughs at his every quip. In fact, Streep laughs incessantly. I kept hoping it was meant to be nervous laughter, hiding some emotional depth. But there's no indication of that. I finally concluded that Meyers directed Streep to giggle her way through the movie so as remind the audience that it's a comedy.Jane's only attempt to address the situation is to throw money at it: She runs to her shrink-- not for a full session, mind you, adultery isn't that big a problem. Dr. Shrink is a busy man but he squeezes her in for 15 minutes, which is plenty because all she wants is for him to tell her what to do so she doesn't have to decide for herself. And what does he advise?? Keep up the adultery, so she can fully explore what it's like to ignore her conscience. No wonder he's got a full schedule.And so the adultery continues. On screen. The sex scenes are unnecessary but they do provide more revelatory parallels with Summertime. It's Complicated exists to prove to American women that we can still be attractive individuals even if we look more like Calamity Jane than Jane Russell. The third time that Jane beds Jake, she hides behind her robe for fear of not appearing sexy enough for him, never mind he's a tub of lard. Jane is victimized by vanity. And director Meyers exacerbates the problem by attempting to make the sex scenes comic, without even the hint of eroticism--what message does that send about the midlife libido? In stark contrast, Hepburn's Jane shows no physical self-consciousness with Rossano Brazzi; she's 48, he's 40, they both look 50, and the sex is off-camera where it belongs because their affair is based on attraction, not lust. It's a refreshingly adult situation handled with due restraint. Clearly, we've regressed considerably since Summertime in 1955.Streep's Jane's vanity can, perhaps, be forgiven because it reflects the zeitgeist: in just six years, between 2000 and 2006, cosmetic surgery increased in the U.S. by 50 percent. What can't be forgiven is the film's endorsement of such superficiality, and its despicable attitude toward Jake's new wife, Agness (Lake Bell). She's set up to be hateful. Her body enters the movie before her face, because she's introduced in a bathing suit with a close-up of her bare torso. Nancy Meyers thus establishes Agness as a trophy wife, diminishing her (nice attitude toward women there, Nancy) and helping the audience nod and wink as Jane continues the illicit affair.Does anybody remember Alan Alda's The Four Seasons (1981)? It's also bittersweet story of divorce, but in it a 42-year-old man (Len Cariou) divorces his middle-aged wife (Sandy Dennis) and remarries a 28-year-old (Bess Armstrong) who is charming, sensitive, good- natured, good-humored, and genuine. The fact that the young wife is likable creates a far more interesting situation. It is not only more respectful of women as individuals, no matter what their age, but also more emotionally intricate for both the characters and the audience. Compared to Alda's modest but realistic comedy, Meyers' is a cynical insult, especially to women.",It's Complicated
76,Gideon24,Star Power makes this one work,7,14 April 2015,"Sparkling performances from the stars make the 2009 comedy It's Complicated seem a lot better than it might really be.I love when Meryl Streep gets to lighten up and she runs with the opportunity that director-writer Nancy Meyers has provided for her here. Streep plays Jane Adler, a lonely-but-in-denial-about-it California divorcée who flies to Manhattan for her son's college graduation and reconnects with her ex-husband, Jake (Alec Baldwin) in more ways than one, despite the fact that he is married to a frosty bitch (Lake Bell) who already has a son but wants another one with Jake. The reconnection between Jake and Jane actually turns into an affair, which becomes complicated by Jane's attraction to her architect (Steve Martin).Another review I read of this film stated that one of the things wrong with this movie is that it displayed middle-aged people behaving like teenagers, but I think that's one of things I liked about this movie...I like the fact that this movie addresses the fact that love and sex and lust don't stop after you turn 21. Meyers doesn't shy away from the fact that these are middle-aged people in a comic romantic triangle...I love the fact that Alec Baldwin wasn't afraid to show his pot belly or that even though they were married for 20 years, Jane makes Jake turn around when she puts on her robe.Meyers' screenplay is not as good as her direction, but the actors make the screenplay seem a lot better than it really is. Streep creates a flawed and fascinating character in Jane, a woman whose lifelong obsession with doing the right thing is challenged by what she thinks might be a new start with something familiar. Alec Baldwin's slick performance as the morally questionable Jake is on the money. Jake does a lot of lousy things in this movie but Baldwin always keeps the character likable. In a refreshing change of pace, Steve Martin actually plays straight man to Baldwin and creates a sweet character who you know is going to get the shaft. Mention should also be made of a scene- stealing turn from John Krasinski as Streep's soon to be son-in-law, who learns of the affair and has to keep it a secret.The film alternates between slapstick and moments of genuine warmth. The pair of scenes where Streep and Baldwin individually try to explain the affair ring true, even if the kids' reaction to it doesn't. If you're a fan of Streep or Baldwin, this film will not disappoint.",It's Complicated
77,ltlacey,What happens when ex-spouses do not have closure.,4,25 May 2010,"I really like the work of the 3 main stars, but for some reason each one mostly bugged the hooey out of me, especially Streep with all that insipid giggling and behaving like some 13-year-old with her first crush on a boy. For awhile there I thought we were watching Diane Keaton (sorry!). What was all that silliness about? The part where she gets stoned (after a single hit) would make sense as to why she would behave as she did, but otherwise it was just annoying. I did like the overall premise of the plot: Ex-spouses still have a thing for one another, and their clandestine affair, and then they come to their senses and get closure, but so much could have been done with this movie, especially considering the cast, so I felt cheated.",It's Complicated
78,calspers,Excellent writing/direction by Nancy Meyers,8,14 September 2019,"""It's Complicated"" (2009) is written and directed by Nancy Meyers. It was a wonderful film by Meyers who once again demonstrates great talent of making a homogenous and well integrated film.Brilliant performances by Baldwin, Martin, and particularly Streep, who is phenomenal. And what great editing and a lovely romantic score by Hans Zimmer.
One thing though, seems apparent: ""It's Complicated"" reminds me terribly of Meyers' 2003 ""Something's Gotta Give"" with Nicholson and Keaton, which in my opinion is a perfect film. This feels very much like a rip-off of that in terms of both plot and character development. In the latter department, the vulnerability of falling in love in late age I think is expressed even more convincingly by Keaton, even though Streep does a formidable job as well.Either way, this Meyers film made me laugh and sympathize extensively due to a brilliant script and smooth and excellent direction. Highly recommended!",It's Complicated
79,chelano,Leans toward older couples,6,26 August 2010,"A nice little easy going film with some added humor. I mean laughing humor and good jokes. Not the humor of seeing Alec Baldwin in his boxers for 60% of the film, which is a tough thing to watch. Meryl Streep and Alec Baldwin make a pretty interesting team in this film and both acted great. Steve Martin is added to the older stew and I am sorry to say that he really didn't fit. There was something off about him. There was some young cast members and the one that really sticks out is John Krasinski. His type of humor and acting sometimes clashes in certain films, but he fit well in this movie. A little added pleasure to the mix I guess you could say. There were smaller parts in the film played by some who seemed to not fit or act well. One example would be Lake Bell, she really didn't fit. The story line was decent but really seemed to jump around a bit and sometimes it seemed like pieces were left out or missing. The one thing that worried me about this film was the whole concept. It really leaned towards one age group. I mean they put younger blood in there to help, but it does focus on older couples. I think even though it is a good movie, they will lose a lot of viewers because of this. But overall, I enjoyed this film and you could say it is one of those Sunday afternoon sit back and watch pieces.",It's Complicated
80,JankiSharma,funny and pleasant and it's complicated,8,11 January 2010,"Nancy Meyers is a good writer and Director. I enjoyed her previous movies( The holiday, Something gotta give, The parent trap among others). And now the funny movie It's complicated. Meryl Streep as plain Jane, dumped by her husband Jake( excellent acting by pot-bellied pudgy Alec Baldwin) of 20 plus yrs who is also the father of her 3 pleasant children is excellent. Jake is now married for 10 yrs to a woman in her late 20s/early30s. Jake turns to his ex-wife for peace, solace and maturity. Jane's conversations with her friends about her involvement with her ex-husband are funny and realistic. John Krasinski as Jane's daughter's boyfriend is comfortable and convincing in uncomfortable situations (adore him in TV show The Office). Steve Martin as the subdued interior decorator Adam can be easily missed. Mery Streep and Alec Baldwin steal the show with their acting talents. Mery Streep may end up with Oscars in 2009 for either or both the roles in 2 good movies : Julie& Julia and It's complicated. Last year Kate Winslet was nominated for 2 movies. 2009 is the year for stylish, sophisticated, extremely talented Mery Streep.",It's Complicated

My first impression on seeing the family house was of the clutter, and then I spent much of the film being aghast at what surgery has done to a couple of the main characters. I haven't see Alex Baldwin in anything for years, and he's very good. But what is the matter with people? why did the main character need permission from her psychiatrist to shag her ex-husband - or anyone? Why were the three adult kids so wimpish? Why didn't they all just suck it up and get on with life? Why do rich people park their cars so far from their houses and get wet? I couldn't help wondering how the Brits would have produced this - or the Australians. A much funnier picture, I'd be bound, and with less angst. Message to the producers - we're not all children out here, needing stuff to be spelled out letter by letter; a bit of subtlety is OK.

I liked the storyline, quite simple but satisfying and imaginable, i even liked the part that she's starting to date another man at the same time she's dating her ex-husband again. However the ending is way to clichéd, ordinary and self-righteous to be bought! A lot of feelings are involved and it all has to end in a Hollywood manner. No one's hurt, everything's back to normal etc. That part ruined the whole movie and made it be like any other romantic comedy with some elements of drama existing today.Why couldn't she and her ex stay together? Here is why - Because he's married to another woman and that would hurt her feelings, Because he has a child with another woman and that would hurt the child's feelings, Because Steve Martin's character is way too good to get hurt and Because their grown children are, out of the blue sky, still not over with their parent's divorce that happened ten years ago and that would hurt their feelings too!!! Pretty ordinary i think! And dull! It's got it's moments i guess, but as it comes closer and closer to the ending they all slowly disappear in the Golden Hollywood standard or better yet rule that sais, it all has to be solved in the best manner for everybody involved.

So was this movie good, I have to say ehh. I watched it because it has a good cast, looked funny, and had Meryl Streep getting high so I thought why not. The story also contained an element I always enjoy cooking. This is a good date movie which at this point I am sick of saying, but it is true. If you are dating someone and it is either early on or you have different tastes, unless you are a pure indy snob, you'll find this movie amusing. However, I would have liked to have seen a darker ending which I think would have made this movie more realistic and therefore good, but it was just more Hollywood tripe at the end of the day. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/",It's Complicated
86,JackCerf,Serves Him Right,6,19 September 2010,"It's Complicated is a passive aggressive revenge fantasy, less blatant than The First Wives Club but along the same lines. The grievance, of course, is that a middle aged man of sufficient income can abandon his wife of equal age and start over with a younger woman. The revenge fantasy is that Jake finds that his eyes were bigger than his stomach, and that no amount of money will buy him back the vigor of his youth. The younger woman's sexual and emotional demands prove too much for him at his age, and she wears him down and humiliates him. There's a scene in the waiting room of a fertility clinic that generalizes the point brutally.Jake learns too late that what he really wanted from life at this point was comfort, not speed, and that comfort is to be found in the bed and kitchen of his ex. After a brief sportive interlude, his ex gets to tell him that his roguish charm isn't enough for the long haul, that she's organized her life without him, and that she won't be taking him back on any terms. The kids agree. Meanwhile, the younger wife has figured out what's going on and kicked Jake out, leaving him ruefully wise too late, with nothing but a Porsche, a law practice and a Flomax prescription. So there. One wonders, of course, whether this is pure vindictive fantasy on the part of the divorced Meyers, or whether she could cite examples from her Hollywood milieu.The revenge in It's Complicated is more subtle than Meyers' earlier Something's Got To Give, where the old guy's sex with the young woman turns into a humbling near death experience. It's also a more plausible setup. Francis Bacon wrote that wives were young men's playthings, middle aged men's companions, and old men's nurses. I never understood why Diane Keaton's character in SGG would want to take on Nicholson's just at the point where he was turning from a companion to a patient. One of Jill Adler's girlfriends warns her not to let Jake trick her into taking care of him, and she doesn't. So guys, be warned. A wife to care for you in your old age is like a 401k; you have to invest young and keep investing if you want it to be there when you finally need it.A number of female critics have complained about what one of them called Nancy Meyers' talent for decorator porn -- impossibly and expensively tasteful interiors where everything is as it should be and not a thing is out of place -- passed off as ordinary upper middle class lifestyle. The complaints have more to do with the critics than they do with Meyers.Meyers' protagonists are not in any sense middle class, or even upper middle class. They are Hollywood rich, in the same way that the characters in 1930s comedies were rich. Nobody complains that events of Bringing Up Baby, or The Philadelphia Story, or My Man Godfrey take place in luxurious surroundings. (Although E.B. White once did a wonderful piece on what the supposedly simple life Bette Davis was living in Dark Victory would have actually cost.) These were unabashed fantasies of life among the well to do that the audience knew it would never enjoy. The rich, as Fitzgerald said, are different than you and me.But they're not different enough for Meyers' target audience or her critics. The most self-conscious class line in the US today is the one between the really, really rich and the professional upper middle class who serve them. The cultivated class is in regular contact with the truly rich, shares their taste, would like to emulate them, can't afford to and resents the truly rich for driving up the price of everything from good tables in Manhattan restaurants to houses in the Hamptons. The female critics who attack Meyers' ""aspirational"" settings are from that milieu. They want a female lead they can identify with, i.e. one of their own age and class. Meyers' scripts give them someone they'd like to identify with, but her set decoration places this upper middle class woman in unabashedly upper class surroundings. They can't enjoy the fantasy because it reminds them of what they would do themselves but can't quite afford to. Unlike the Depression era folks watching the impossibly remote doings of celluloid zillionaires, what these critics see in a Meyers movie is tantalizingly, and annoyingly just out of reach in their lives outside the theater.But it is not out of reach to Meyers or to the people among whom she moves. They say you should write what you know. Meyers is Hollywood rich in real life, and she is completely unashamed of it. Her movie industry characters work hard at what they do, love their work, and deserve all the money they've made -- think both Cameron Diaz and Jack Black in The Holiday. That kind of money is the opportunity to do whatever you want and to express your true self by the stuff you surround it with. In Meyers' world, choosing quietly luxurious good taste over ostentation, profligacy or dissipation is the outward evidence of inward grace; of modesty, balance, maturity, self control and all around good character. There's enough vulgar or self destructive consumption in Hollywood to make me think Meyers has a valid take on the community in which she lives. It's too bad that her critics can't afford to live there.",It's Complicated

88,pik923,What a bore,3,30 April 2010,"Meryl can act we all know that and even a rather bland and unsurprising script can't stop her from putting her best foot forward. With that said, Alec B was completely miscast besides he can't act. I could not wait for him to get off the screen. Steve Martin who is a bit better is still not perfectly cast. He's too awkward for the grace of Meryl. The kids weren't too bad but boring - not their fault, the script did that.So Meryl is fun when she drinks, or let's say completely drunk. And divorced women drink a lot from what we see in this script. And she will even smoke a joint, oh no did she really do that. Oh all those memories. Again, it was old and boring and not very interesting.This stretched on for 2 hours. It would have worked if they edited out about an hour of the film and just gave us the highlights. It was badly edited - from the very beginning with the shots of the coast line and the jumpy editing - I knew I was in for a disappointment.And the last scene in the rain, when the sun comes out! Obviously the 'storm' was staged. It was that obvious.All in all I don't know why they made this film. I don't know why so much money is wasted on films that are a waste of time. Too bad! i guess Meryl did it because she likes to work. She could be a bit more discerning. A bit of discrimination in her part would be nice.Alec does a great job on TCM with Robert Osborne, but Alec should stop trying to act.",It's Complicated
89,LilyDaleLady,"Standard issue Nancy Meyer comedy, with one outstanding performance",3,14 February 2010,"If you've seen one Nancy Meyer comedy, you've basically seen everything she has to give -- posh interiors, a sympathetic 50ish actress, older women having hot love affairs, posh interiors, menopause jokes and did I say posh interiors? There IS one reason to see ""It's Complicated"" rather than the others, and that's Alec Baldwin; once a bland pretty boy, he has matured into a sharply funny leading man. Most of us know his work from ""30 Rock"". He's downright hilarious here, bravely baring a pudgy body and letting it all hang out. Many of his scenes are laugh out loud hilarious.Otherwise, honestly this film reminded me of the kind of ""women's movie"" my mom and grandma liked -- 40s and 50s stuff, often starring heroines like Jennifer Jones or Lana Turner, as long-suffering mature ladies, going through various angst, and getting to fall in love with Rock Hudson or Cary Grant. The settings and costumes were always very lavish, and those films were a kind of fantasy outlet for ordinary homemakers of that era, reassuring in their message that you too could look this glamorous at 40 plus, you too could live in a Hollywood dream castle and be adored by a handsome (yet mature) fella.I guess I thought women, through feminism and jobs and the last 40 years had outgrown this stuff, but apparently not. ""It's Complicated"" is a straight throwback to that sort of movie, with the addition of a bit of humor, some pot smoking and nudity.A lot of people have mentioned the over-the-top art direction, and frankly, it is so intrusive that becomes more important than any other element of the film, which is problematic. (If Baldwin wasn't there to generate some laughs, it would be ALL the film is about!) There is nothing in this story that could not have been told in a trailer park, a middle-class bungalow or a (believable) upper-middle class suburban home. But Meyer's (herself obviously a Hollywood mega-billionaire) can't picture ANY OTHER setting than super-wealthy California. The sprawling Mediterranean home, picturesquely set on acres and acres of land, complete with pool and vast Martha-Stewart-on-steroids garden is just not believable for a divorcée putting 3 kids through college. Unless, of course, they are mega-billionaires. And if they are, that pretty much removes them from the sympathetic category entirely for audience, which I think is why the film feels cold and why even if we laugh, we feel nothing when the ending meanders off, with no clear resolution or romance.It's especially annoying in a time of severe economic downturn to show a heroine whose major issue and ambition is vastly enlarging the already ginormous designer kitchen in her giant mansion; frankly I think most of the audience is wondering, as I was, what exactly she could have thought she was missing in a room that ALREADY was larger than most people's living room, already had marble counters and Viking range and Sub-zero fridge. It's obscene actually, in the way of banksters and Bernie Madoff; ostentatiousness for it's own sake.Another pet peeve, though by no means unique to this film, is showing working-age adults who seemingly do not ever have to go any sort of work, and just ""hang out"" all day long, having long meaningful talks, drinking wine, etc. It's as if the scriptwriters literally have no idea how people spend their time. For example, Baldwin is supposedly a partner in a law film, but never goes in to work or has a case, but can have hookups with his ex all day. Streep supposedly runs a chi-chi bakery, but never has to go there, and can hang around her home cooking lavish meals all day (2 hints: professional cooks and bakers usually get enough of cooking and cleaning at their day job AND bakers start baking in the wee hours of the morning -- do you think those hot croissants materialize by themselves? -- so sex in the bakery would be problematic to say the least. Both jobs involve insanely long hours!) It's also sloppy that the decor of Jane's (Streep)mega-mansion is precisely like her daughter's house, her shrink's office, or even the hotel the lover's meet in. Bland, opulent ""California Casual"". There is no attempt to really define character or show a personal style; how many 25 year old girl's want a home that looks EXACTLY like their mom's? Basically, this gives the film the flat, overly well-lit look of a premium shelter magazine, like Architectural Digest or House & Garden.Good for selling ""chotchka's""; not so great for a 2 hour film. In conclusion, wait for cable or a Netflix rental, then enjoy Baldwin's performance.",It's Complicated

The performances were all excellent, and the fact that it is a romantic comedy brings a lot of latitude in the credibility stakes. Early on, I was rather dismayed by Steve Martin's appearance and I thought his character seemed destined to be over-serious, which didn't seem right. Steve is brilliant at comedy, physical humour and dancing. Eventually I realised why he had been cast in this role, and he delivered on the promise. Meryl Streep was spectacular and the younger cast members as her children were all believable. Alec Baldwin is a little chubby, but that was worked into the plot and didn't seem wrong - he's a middle aged man, and he had a heart scare as well.As a story, it could have been deeper or more real, but it worked as entertainment.

92,jax713,It's Disappointing,5,4 May 2010,"This is the first time I've been disappointed by Nancy Meyers. I usually find her films snappy, witty and with a fresh take on some of life's pitfalls. More than anything, I have great appreciation for the kind of female characters she gives us - they are always multi-dimensional, likable and down to earth, with just the right amount of glamor and a nicely sized dollop of dilemmas and conflicts. The men in Meyers' stories are equally likable even though we clearly see their shortcomings and she manages to make us suspicious of their mate-potential in a men-are-from-Mars humorous way.For me, It's Complicated gets a little too simple at the end. Yes, in true Meyers tradition, the woman gets to make the choices and we are led to think the woman is capable of making the correct one. But in this movie, all is not so clear. There seemed to be a noticeable lack of chemistry between Streep and Martin and because events took place over a short period of time, there appeared to be no reason demanding a choice at all. Martin looks uncomfortable all the time, almost squeamish, as though he is cowed by being in Streep's presence rather than as an interpretation of the character he plays. Conversely, Baldwin is irresistible despite his flabby body and puffy face because of the comedic timing and devilish nature he brings to his role, a role that makes him the most untrustworthy of all men - one who seems not to know what he really wants except for what he doesn't have. A male paradox of the ages. Excellent acting all around except for Martin, funny dialog & situations, but it felt like the ending opened the door for a sequel. Maybe that ending is the complicated part? I, for one, would like to see a Part 2.",It's Complicated

The viewer wasn't sure if this was a comedy or a drama. Some of these dramadies work (see ""500 Days of Summer"") but this didn't work because the ending didn't close well and the viewer wasn't sure what to make of it.Part of the problem was Alec Baldwin was such a likable character but was written up to be a cad who we aren't supposed to feel the least bit sorry for. Steve Martin wasn't all that likable, but the way it was written he came out on top. But why? I can't see how the Producers, who focus group these things eight ways to Sunday, thought this ending was a winner.The children were also incoherent. We are lead to believe they loved their Dad (Baldwin) but when he discloses he wants to get back with their Mom (Meryl Streep), they seem to go catatonic with grief, curling under the covers with tears in their eyes. One minute they love him and want him around all of the time and the next minute they are numb with confused feelings of disbelief.

94,PeachesIR,Frivolous fun,7,18 October 2018,"""It's Complicated"" is a frothy, sophisticated rom-com from director Nancy Meyers, and it has all the hallmarks of her distinctive oeuvre: Romantic angst among the wealthy, accomplished middle-aged set, with situational humor, witty banter and tasteful sex scenes, all set in the most spectacularly decorated fantasy homes. Meryl Streep is Jane, a successful gourmet cook and retailer in the upscale L.A. suburbs, who is having an affair with her lawyer ex-husband, Jake (Alec Baldwin), who left her for a younger woman years before. Complicating matters further is architect Adam (Steve Martin), who is also mad for Meryl's Jane. This movie touches on some timely issues, such as divorce, finding new love in middle age, and self-esteem crises, but mostly, it's a stylish, smart comedy in a glamorous milieu.",It's Complicated
95,spelvini,First Thing We Do- Kill All the Lawyers,8,14 March 2014,"Every time Alec Baldwin appears on screen in this flick in some gnarly moment immersed in emotional conflict between his ex-wife Meryl Streep and children there's always slightly bitter-sweet feelings in the viewer because we're reminded of his real-life domestic issues between him and his real ex-wife Kim Bassinger and their child which were made so public when the power couple officially broke up.Successful restaurant owner Jane Adler (Meryl Streep) is saddened as her three children have all moved out and when her ex-husband attorney Jake Adler (Alec Baldwin) approaches her for a romantic reconnecting she must reevaluate their differences and possible new beginning. Jake's current trophy wife Agness (LakeBell) is pressuring Jake for another child, and sensitive architect Adam Schaffer (Steve Martin) begins a relationship with Jane. As Jake and Jane go through numerous sexual exploits they begin to understand themselves better and their differences and when it seems there is no hope for the future, they realize just what they mean to each other.These are fleeting nano-moments as Baldwin manages to anchor this movie in ways that allow the mediocre writing to soar. His character never comes off as some obnoxious attorney but rather as a needy sincere professional approaching his golden years. His argument to Streep's Jane at one point is solid when he claims that they are in the perfect place in their lives to make it work between them, since the children are moved out and they can finally spend time with each other without distraction.The who-cares attitude we get from the picture is infused by the antics of the lead characters Jake and Jane and the overt way that the script insists on hitting the clichéd high points in the narrative and the feel-good gee, what-if concept of two successful middle-aged people having an affair since one of them has divorce and married a trophy wife.Even the script is pastry thin. Writer/director Nancy Meyers wisely hands the material over to a stalwart cast Meryl Streep, Steve Martin, Alec Baldwin, John Krasinski, and Lake Bell and although the real comedic heavy lifting is managed by Baldwin, his partner Meryl Streep shows her particular comedic side as a lonely successful business woman and mother in her fifties who hasn't dated in years.Writer/director Nancy Meyers relates the entire commerce between men and women to food, and in particular to how food, and drink bond couples and families. When Jake and Jane reconnect it occurs during a mistaken meal together that they stumble on, opening the door to a night of renewed coupling. When Jane turns it on to win over Adam's affection an extensive sequence involves their preparing chocolate croissants which brings their love together.Jane's core problem with her relationships is that it is defined by her handling of food, and by extension her male partners are insulated by how they redefine meals and other consumables. After a night of getting high and dancing Jane drags Adam back to her factory and in essence puts him to work before making love to him using the food as a conduit. When Jane agrees to a nightly tryst with Jake she temps him with a voiced menu including his favorite chocolate cake, and when Jake stands her up.The core issues with Jane's inability to connect with men is reflected in her own inability to connect honestly with her own feelings, so when she urgently tracks down her analyst and asks him to tell it's okay to have an affair with her married husband, she is relived when he merely suggest that she ""let it go"" and explore what she feels about Jake.The movie also stacks the deck with some characters coming across with little sympathy. LakeBell's trophy wife Agness is a no-nonsense single mother who lacks little soft points. She orders Jake around and has him going to a fertility lab every other day so they can have a child of their own. It is a shame that Agness isn't given more sympathetic moments. She is introduced as a snake charmer who harangues Jake through several scenes and only manages to get one humanizing moment when she looks at Jake and sees his love for Jane.Agness's young son from a previous marriage Emjay Anthony's Pedro is an undisciplined terror, and Jake is helpless and unmotivated to rein him in. In one small scene the Gestapo-type cross examination that Pedro lays on Jake will make any single mother rethink her home-schooling techniques.If you have gone through a divorce, or even had a break up, and even if you're not in a mid-life love affair, you'll have a fun time watching Baldwin, Streep and all the others in this bedroom farce, which delivers some real poignancy at the end.",It's Complicated
96,sunraider,Encouraging Infidelity & Breaking Up Marriages,3,13 August 2012,"Although I chuckled at some of its cheap sexual jokes and innuendo, this film bothered me quite a bit because of its ready acceptance and even celebration of infidelity and home wreaking. Meryl Streep and Alec Baldwin are a divorced couple who engage in an affair after a drunken night of revelry rekindles old feelings. It's an ""affair"" because Baldwin is married to a hot young trophy wife, has a 5-year old stepson, and is visiting the fertility clinic every other day so that he and his wife can have a baby together.Although it's Baldwin's character who first encourages continuing the relationship after the drunken orgy, Streep readily gives in, egged on by Rita Wilson and other assorted gal pals who think it's great and even her shrink, who marvels at Streep's new-found openness. At no time in this movie is there any thought about the harm being done to the wife and the innocent child, both of whom are portrayed as rather unlikable characters (the woman is a bitch and the boy is annoying) so as to make the affair more palatable. In addition to the illicit sex and Baldwin abandoning his family, we have Streep and Steve Martin smokin' the weed and getting high.There's chemistry between Streep and third-billed Baldwin. If the film had had Baldwin being a swingin' bachelor regretting his divorce and attempting to rekindle a romance with his ex-wife, then it might have been worth something. As it is, it's Hollyweird values on display and very shallow.",It's Complicated

98,GLanoue,"Smart actors, dumb script",6,22 March 2011,"This romcom suffers from too much forced lightness from Meryl Streep. We have seen her in so many serious roles where her wonderful talent makes us believe her character, that I cannot accept her here as a 50 something divorcée who has an affair with her ex Alec Baldwin. The first half of the movie is simply too long. Do we really need the obligatory girls-at-home drinking and talking about s-e-x (giggle, giggle) scene? A gang of other 50 somethings talking about vaginas closing up if they're not used? Come on. It adds nothing to the storyline, and makes Streep seem like a bubblehead, which just goes too much against her screen persona. The other problem here is Steve Martin. He is underused and only comes into his own in the last third or so of the movie. He is also the only one who seems like a believable adult (go figure! Steve Martin, the wild and crazy guy), which is in fact acknowledged by Streep in the denouement, when she remarks (MIlD SPOILER), so this is how adults talk. Yeah, it is. The writers should have thought that educated and rich people who apparently have lots of free time and who reach their fifties should have learned something about being adult, but apparently they haven't, or the writers think the public is incapable of handling an adult screen persona. What this movie needed were actors better suited to the premise of the script, meaning not so good as what we get. But then the producers couldn't have launched the necessary PR hype to recover the huge budget (really? How did that happen? There's nothing in the movie justify it), and receipts would have been lower. Streep, as I said, acts somewhat light-headed. And Baldwin, whose screen and TV persona is smart, sharp and cynical, acts like a sheep whose hormones have knocked 30 or so points off his IQ, which might be believable at 25 but hardly at 55. The writers should have taken lessons from Martin, who has shown us time and again that funny doesn't mean dumb. Still, somewhat entertaining.",It's Complicated
99,pettyfog,It's Complicated is Complicated,8,10 May 2010,"I don't like obvious, pandering Chick-Flicks. In fact I hate them. This isn't a 'Chick-Flick' unless your definition almost solely depends on the plot's perceived point of view. This film is a masterpiece of social commentary because the writing and the characters allow the human relationships to develop far deeper than included in the screenplay, once you start to wonder about the real people.In the opening scenes, I found myself wondering about the casting as much as thinking about the plot set-up.Streep I understand. Someone has to play the role, and Diane Keaton's now a stereotypical caricature in this element.Baldwin.. WHY? He's far from simpatico in almost every movie he's been in, exceptions being Hunt for Red October, Great Balls of Fire {he made Jimmy Swaggart human tho you have to dig it out of the script bias} and of course, Beetle Juice.John Krasinski.. Why? Though he's getting the recognition he deserves, he plays the prospective son-in-law in what shouldn't be more than a sub-plot.Steve Martin.. he's done small but key parts before and it seemed apparent that this would be another of those. But there's others that are more pleasing to the integration of what this movie SEEMED to be.The answers became apparent later on.The main characters, Streep, Baldwin and by extension Martin are ALL successful by almost any measure. Except one. That being their marital past. The scenario is that the last of the brood is about to strike out on his own, bringing the parents together and raising the question in their, especially Streep's, mind.. Where Do I go From Here!Baldwin sees his family and wonders why he left them for a 'trophy wife' who brings the baggage of raising yet another brood. He realizes he really doesn't want to go through that again, because he doesn't relate to kids at all until they are full adults. And that's part of the plot throughout. - It's important to understand that 'Pedro' is portrayed how he's seen by the main characters, not how he really is. The kid couldn't possibly be that bratty because the glimpses we see of Agness portray a reasonably well-adjusted woman, not a self-centered narcissist. So the REAL motivator for Jake is he wishes he hadn't taken the easy way out and he doesn't want to go through all that again.Streep's Jane is set on the need to attain the accouterments of personal success that everyone wants in Life's middle stage: A huge personal workshop to indulge her passion, which to her is an over-indulging kitchen, and a nest with a view fitting her self-image.Martin is portrayed as Streep's counterpoint. He also was left alone and wonders what he did wrong, and spent years until he realized he did nothing wrong, Stuff Happens. He's a 'nerd' because he sees himself and his vocation as one and the same, yet he obviously is successful by understanding others' wants and needs. It just took him a long time to realize that from his personal life, and that is also key to the end of the film. -This is NO cameo or small part!John Krasinski.. ah, deeper into the movie he becomes a key plot element because he's the indicator for family loyalty. He has a connection with the well being of the family even though he's not officially a part of it yet. And that shows that, whatever the characters' personal peccadilloes, the kids grew up as far from dysfunctional as you can get.For the shallow, there's the obvious fun stuff.Ewww: We have to see Baldwin nude. Ahhh: We Don't have to see Streep nudeEwww: Old peepul have sex, and freaking THINK about having sex. Ahhhh: We don't care about young peeps having sex. In fact, according to this movie, they may not even have sex at all. - That's a delicious plot twist, isn't it!Hahhaaaa: Old Peepul smoke dope. From the most potent joint ever made by man! Huh? Well, whatta we know about grass. The reaction's purely personal, and situation dependent. Jane takes her first hit in thirty years and immediately goes into stoner mode BECAUSE she's so nervous about her date with Adam. Hahhaaa! Turned 'Something's gotta Give' on its head. Nothing REALLY wrong with Jake, just over-excited. Take that Jack, you weenie!There's even more little 'Easter Eggs': Martin and Streep sitting in a Swing. My kid says 'Hey! Look at that.. obviously they threw that swing up at the last minute.' Later it seems possible that the swing itself is a 'fun bit' when you see the 2 end of swing Views, vs the 2 cam views from 'Inside the Swing'. There's lots more but it would take forever and we have to see the thing several times to dig 'em out. Even the scene from the staked out 'addition' is well done and shows exactly the right elevations, though it seems stupid and wrong at first.Summary: This is a deliciously deep romantic comedy that should be enjoyed by anyone who bothers to actually get involved. Nancy Meyers is a cinematic genius if for nothing else than her particular viewpoint and the ability to express it at so many levels, including attention to detail.I give this film.. again FILM, not Movie!... 8.5.

The pairing of Meryl Streep, Alec Baldwin and Steve Martin is brilliant. All of these actors possess a pedigree such that their names speak for themselves. Therefore, watching them in this movie is a pure joy.Alec Baldwin's teen-aged antics are positively hilarious.

There *were* a couple of lines and one situation that made me smile but around a couple of dozen middle aged women in the theatre howled with laughter almost all the time so I might have missed one.An innocuous way of whiling away four hours, I suppose. OK, I know - but it *felt* like four hours.Some films give the impression that the writers sat down without much idea how the plotting was going to evolve: they start in a desultory way but eventually pick up a theme and sub-plots to finish in a reasonably satisfying two hours. ""It's complicated"" began this way - unfortunately nothing much changed, for me at least.One of the best actors of our time - Ms Streep - seemed all the time to be regretting having signed the contract. The youngsters' Californian accents made me wish for subtitles since quite a lot of the dialogue was incomprehensible to this Englishman. And teetering between slight comedy and occasional farce is almost never a good idea - certainly it must be done a lot better than it was here.But I mustn't make too big a deal criticising the movie: it was not made as great art, merely as a middle-age chick-flick and - judging by the aforementioned middle aged chicks' responses - hit its intended audience fairly and squarely.However, just for the record, this punter found it to be a thin idea which hadn't been developed nearly enough to merit more than a three.",It's Complicated

Maybe that's why I didn't enjoy it very much.I only gave It's Complicated a view because I like Alec Baldwin in the sitcom 30 Rock and I figured he'd bring his comedic charm to this movie. How wrong I was. Although Baldwin is usually quite a funny guy he's not exactly on fine form here. Although he does get a few witty one-liners they're not enough to save the movie.In truth, It's Complicated has quite a dull and slow-moving storyline and nothing much of interest happens to keep you entertained. The character development takes up two-thirds of the movie and the last thirty minutes are really where everything happens.Surprisingly, Steve Martin emerges as the highlight of this movie, despite the fact he plays a significantly smaller part than Streep and Baldwin. But it's not the comedic element of the movie that he shines in, although not through lack of trying. He well and truly shows that he is past his comedic prime but he does deliver a good performance.Now this may just be because I'm not the target audience for this movie, but the scenes (and there's no shortage of them) where Streep and Baldwin are half-dressed aren't too appealing. In fact they're a little disturbing. With the exception of those scenes, the remainder does feel like a made-for-TV movie, seemingly following all the clichés and ticking them off on the way. All-in-all the trailer is pretty much the best part of the movie, it packs all the laughs of the movie into a 2- minute clip.

If I have to see Meryl Streep laugh like a 13 year old one more time I'm going to throw up. The whole company of actors in this film are simply mugging for the camera. It is just hammy, hammy, hammy all the way around.This brings to mind the hilarious SNL skits titled ""Master Thespian."" Jon Lovitz is superb as he skewers actors.

108,JaysonT,Meh!,4,18 February 2010,"""It's Complicated"" has a premise that's first of all not meant to be unfolded into a 2 hour film. The story is simple enough that we really don't need the extra baggage Meyers piles on us, though even here it doesn't matter.Meryl Streep, who is effortless as always in showing us a woman usually uptight in her ways but still joyful, plays a recently divorced woman who is still (of course) successful in business. She runs her own catering company. She also has three successful children, all in their college years, who I had a hard time reading since they seem plucked out of 1960s sitcom land. Her ex-husband, Alec Baldwin, has married a young uptight bitch, whose son is a royal pain and whose main objective in this movie is to be ""the villain"". Hence she gets no back-story or even a glimpse of dimension. Steve Martin is Streep's reserved architect, designing her dream home and also sharing chocolate croissants with her and basking in loneliness together.The major plot: Alec Baldwin decides he wants to have an affair with Streep when they all go to New York for a graduation, and Streep can't handle this because...well it's complicated.The problem with the movie is that the stakes are way too low. How is the audience supposed to care about Meryl being so enraged with Alec for seducing her? She's not married. Her children are gone. She has no commitments. There's a possible attraction to Steve, but it's not confirmed. When she spills the beans to her children, they behave like nine year-olds and run into a separate bedroom with they all huddle on the bed together as if they've been drafted to Iraq. Get over it- your parents are rich enough to own a country and you're all getting your tuition paid for. In a really annoying scene, Streep hands over her credit card to her son so he can go ""party it up"" in New York. Yeah, these people have real issues all right.There are, of course, parts of the movie that work. I enjoyed watching Streep and Baldwin together, talk about getting old together and their chemistry. The scene where Streep and Martin get high together is the one major laugh in the film, as the pacing is excellent and the absurdity of these mature, grown squares lighting it up as if they're frat boys is comical. But these are the few exceptions.Of the three principal performances, Meryl Streep comes off glowing. Despite the flawed plot and dreadful screenplay, Streep gives one of her most relaxed and sensual performances. She seems so on top in her form that its a shame the rest of the picture couldn't be as dedicated. Her expressions are as strong as her use with dialect, and in one particular fun scene she gives a glaring look to her ex's new squeeze in an elevator.The film has made over $110 million domestically, and almost $200 million worldwide. It pretty much demonstrates that Streep, Baldwin and Martin can still gather in the crowds. And it's nice to see older couples dealing with relationship issues. But I'm surprised still at the high numbers for a movie that really doesn't need to be longer then twenty minutes.FINAL GRADE: D+",It's Complicated

It was a very mild mannered movie and if you're in the mood for something very lighthearted, you'll likely enjoy at least parts of it. 
If have mixed feelings on the storyline, but mostly due to it being centered around people having affairs, whether Lake Bells character was awful or not...I'll never agree with cheating. If you're unhappy, either fix it or leave...but don't cheat. Alec Baldwin's character was irritating and self-involved, he didn't much care what Meryl Streep's character wanted...he just wanted her back and was prepared to mess up the life he'd created with a child in tow (whether he's his or not, that doesn't matter, he's still only 5 years old) as well, to get it.
He's basically your average stereotypical man, who's left his Older Wife for the younger model...only to later realize, he'd made a mistake. He's not the first, and won't be the last!
I usually like Steve Martin in movies, but he was very uncomedic like in this and somewhat more serious. And I guess I would've hoped for some more comedy, to maybe carry the storyline a little better than it just being about an affair!

Meryl Streep does all things well including comedy and Alec Baldwin is the perfect fit for a character who is full of himself and conveniently self delusional. Throw in Steve Martin and John Krasinksi (who mines comic gold each week on ""The Office"") and I was expecting a diverting 120 minutes. Instead this movie irritated me continuously for 2 hours. What went wrong? I am going to cut the actors some slack and lay the blame at the feet of director and writer Nancy Meyers. She tends to write movies that have a thin veneer of neurotic self-entitlement. Sometimes it works or is at least tolerable as in ""The Holiday"" but here she lays it on a bit thick. Streep's Jane is the type of woman who has feng shui'd her life into submission, watches ""The Hills"" with her daughter, and makes ice cream when she can't sleep ( funny, all I get are bags under my eyes). Her romantic dilemma is a choice between two men - an architect who lost his wife to another man on a couples bike tour of Italy and the ex who lives under the twin threat of his younger wife's fascist ovulation schedule and a demon step-child. Cliché on top of cliché that eventually eclipses the acting.Speaking of acting. What a waste to have Jim Krasinksi in this movie. His role as Jane's future son-in-law is to wince, shrug, smile and sigh. Note to Nancy Meyers, facial expressions and body language are only the beginning of emoting and not the final product. Last note and then I will stop beating up on the movie, I promise. I don't know what Jane's three adult children are supposed to represent but they are harpy, over emotional and creepy in a Stepford sort of way.

The potential was there with a good cast but it falls short on substance, romance and comedy, all required if this movie is to deliver. Instead it falls into the category of mediocre.I loved the idea of a romantic comedy with middle-aged stars, however this movie does them no credit. It is not romantic - more the idiocy of people who were old enough to know better. They are all rich, successful and self-indulgent yet none are happy with their lives. Boo hoo, it's hard to be sympathetic.It's a shame that Meryl Streep agreed to this movie. She is one of the most brilliant female actresses of today, and not since the appalling Mamma Mia has she taken such a mis-step. This role had Diane Keaton written all over it, and even then it would still have been a stinker but easier to swallow. Meryl's character Jane vacuously giggles throughout this movie which is discordant with the portrayal of a somewhat bitter divorcée of 10 years, an indulgent mother and a successful businesswoman. It grew tired quickly and then became irritating. Alec Bladwin, as Jake is unlikeable. His character is part charm part slime. There is disbelief in this viewer's mind that Jane would ever be remotely tempted to revisit her unhappy past with him again. Jake's existing relationship is far from perfect and rather than putting in the hard yards, he turns to his ex-wife for tried-and-true sex and mothering. How flattering. How romantic. Not! Steve Martin's character as an alternate love interest is a bit nerdy and emotionally fragile. He's the token 'nice guy', and supposedly the one we should be rooting for. I was somewhat distracted by his surgically (?) assisted face.As for comedy, only one scene comes to mind worthy of a mention where I laughed - the laptop scene, even though I could see it coming.

Neither of us has smoked dope since before the kids were born, but we like our wine. One has been though a divorce. We could be Jane and Jake! Then why does this whole production ring so completely hollow from start to finish? Here are a few reasons: 1. These two are supposed to be highly, even ridiculously, successful yet neither one seems to have the least problem in taking off for hours at a time in the middle of the day. The Blackberry never interrupts to remind them that they have jobs; they have every evening off to pursue their liaison. Jane may drop in to her chic bakery (or, as it is no doubt called, her patisserie) from time to time to dip a well-manicured finger into a batch of croissant dough, but Jake seems to be completely idle - a rich lawyer, with two families to support, staying in suites at the Regency Hotel on Park Avenue, driving a Porsche, and no hours to bill. Nice work if you can get it.2. Jane has a large house with a beautiful kitchen (two ovens, no less). Her kids are all out of the house, she's living alone and (despite rarely showing up at work) evidently a woman with a thriving business. Perhaps time to downsize, find a nice townhouse or even a condo by the beach somewhere? Maybe cash out and put aside some of the proceeds for an early and well-deserved retirement in the south of France? Not a bit of it. She wants to put on a huge addition, with an ""enclosed"" kitchen, to the tune of about $200K.3. Meanwhile, Jake has left the literate, talented, independent and still quite beautiful Jane, for a woman with the personality of a piranha and no perceptible ability to carry on a conversation. And, with due respect, not a great looker either.Were it not for Meryl Streep, this film would be utterly devoid of any redeeming merit. After about 10 minutes the only pleasure that can be derived from it is in watching a great actress, through the enormity of her talent, make a lousy movie tolerable.There may be a decent movie to be made from this premise, but if there is it will be made in France or Italy, where they approach these things with a degree of sophistication and wit that seems to be well beyond Hollywood's grasp.",It's Complicated
114,cl777,Loved it!,8,1 February 2010,"I liked this movie more than I thought I would. Perhaps because my parents are divorced, perhaps because I watched it with my mother and was trying to see it through her eyes. I thought it flowed well and was entertaining, touching and both light and of substance. Nancy Meyers, who also directed and wrote ""The Holiday"" and ""Something's Gotta Give"", is very good at this genre and with Meryl Streep as the lead, can hardly go wrong.Playing Jane, a beautiful, professionally fulfilled, divorcée in her late fifties, Meryl brings such an intensity and realism to her character that she truly makes and carries the film. One can not only understand but feel her loneliness as her kids all slowly leave her, go to college, graduate etc. Alec Baldwin is excellent too as her post mid-life crisis ex-husband, Jake, who after marrying a much younger, usually only half dressed, woman named Agness, is clearly unhappy and cannot tolerate for much longer her snapping her fingers at him when she needs him to clean something or make love to her at ovulation time.An affair begins between the two as Jake tries to find refuge in Jane, with whom he feels back at home, both physically and emotionally. She makes him good home-made ice cream, they have nice conversations and most of all- besides the great sex- he enjoys the peace and quiet. Their chemistry is great and believable but unfortunately for him, Meryl has another admirer, her ""nerdy"" architect, Steve Martin, also well cast, though purposely in a more minor, background role. He takes her out on nice dates, has also recently gone through a divorce, and is very much smitten. Jane needs to choose between the two. She is definitely happy, glowing and re-living, but feels very torn between the familiar with her now very needy ex-husband and the appeal of something fresh and new.The themes of divorce, love, family and relationships in general are very well treated in this film. I thought a comment made by Meryl's character about why she thought her marriage with Baldwin ended was particularly poignant- she said it wasn't all his fault and that she had given up on the relationship long before he cheated, using it as an excuse to end things. I am sure many couples find themselves in similar situations, where cheating is often a product not just a cause of trouble. One touch that bothered me was that I felt the children were too nice and too forgiving to a father who left their mother for a woman half her age. Whenever they saw him pulling up in his Porsche they screamed ""Daddy! Daddy!"" and were overjoyed. I thought that was fake and simplified and there could have been at least one sibling who would have a bit of lingering hurt and resentment. A special mention for both the performance and character of John Krasinski who plays the role of Harley, a perfect boyfriend to the eldest daughter, but also a confidant who sees many things he shouldn't and reacts very comically and naturally.There are tons of funny, lots of real and even some sad scenes, but there is also quite a bit of predictability. I nevertheless very much enjoyed this romantic comedy and thought it was one of the best of its kind that I have seen recently.

115,papacorn,Let's Have More of This!,10,25 December 2009,"I would give It's Complicated an 11 if it were possible! There isn't anything I would change about this movie. Meryl Streep and Alec Baldwin have a chemistry that I'm willing to beg and plead will go on. I want to see more of this duo. My direct request to Nancy Meyers is ""keep these intelligent scripts coming."" This story is an antidote to all the stupid stuff that's being shoveled out of Hollywood. Give us more of this! It's Complicated has both humor and pathos. Steve Martin plays a great foil to Baldwin's character. He's attractive and vulnerable. Streep has a genuine dilemma of riches with these two. If she would have to choose, how could she? In different ways, equally appealing, these guys wear their hearts on their sleeves. And before all the male moviegoers say, ""ugh"" and cross it off as a ""chick flick,"" note that men in the audience laughed as hard and loud as women. ""Hilarious"" honestly applies to this film. The script is tight. The supporting cast is very natural. Jim Krasinski, is especially good in his role as son-in-law. An important note, it's rated R, so leave the kids with a sitter. Treat yourself to a movie that won't bring you down nor insult your intelligence. You'll delight in what fine actors can do when all the ingredients are there.",It's Complicated
116,lukalele,Garbage,1,15 June 2010,"Saturday night... movie night with the girlfriend. She wants to get a film I've never really heard of called It's Complicated, from the description all I see is that it's a romcom. I suggest some other films saying that I'm not really in the mood for another romcom, as there seems to be one released every week lately, they're all so formulaic and we seem to see them all.Needless to say 5 minutes later we were sitting on the couch, settling in to watch It's Complicated.Giving in once again does have certain advantages, as I warned her that my objections to seeing yet another romcom gave me license to pay it out, if it came to that. Unfortunately for this film, it did.As much as I respect her as an actress, all that Meryl Streep touches doth not turn to gold, and as much as I like Alec Baldwin as a comedic actor from the likes of 30 Rock, he cannot save this film. There is nothing to like about the characters, no development at all, they're all unconvincing, unrealistic, ultra-successful, perfect people with perfect lives. Even the situations they get themselves into are perfectly 'complicated' (damn that title), and you know it's all gonna come out perfectly in the end anyway. Don't expect any surprises here. I respect the filmmaker trying to present the romcom from a different angle (middle-age), but it quickly becomes as typical and predictable as the rest, especially with Streep's character behaving the way she does you're quickly forced to forget the different angle presented here that the film had going for it.Baldwin's character is a terrible misogynist, but that's OK when you present his new trophy wife as a b*tch (played by Lake Bell, totally overshadowed by the better acting talent on offer here just as she was in Boston Legal) with a horrible movie-child, clashing terribly with the too-perfect grown up children Streep and Baldwin's characters had when they were first married.Streep's character is the most insipid, self-indulgent, shallow character since Carrie Bradshaw. She's impossible to like. For 5 minutes at the start of the film we're presented with a few scenes making it blatantly obvious how alone she's become, 2 minutes after that problem solved, she's in bed with her punch-in-the-face persistent ex-husband Baldwin (leave aside any indication of why they got divorced in the first place, save for a few gratuitous hints that are meant to be quickly forgotten) after giggling like a schoolgirl at the nauseating crap he spouts to get her into bed, which of course leads to the 'complications' the film's title suggests when she meets Steve Martin, the 'perfect guy' you know she's going to end up with. Hard to feel any sympathy for her. I was waiting for her to ask one other character how they were, how their life was going, anything. None of that. She basically plays a 60 year old totally self-absorbed teenager, again giggling like a schoolgirl with her fleeting friends about the sex she's having with her ex in one painful scene.Steve 'not funny any more' Martin might have been a guy who by the looks of him 15 or 20 years ago was going to age gracefully, but unfortunately he has not let that happen. His face looks like it could melt at any moment, not one wrinkle to be seen, for me taking away any credibility his character might have had. Don't let him near that baking oven, Meryl! We could have a scene akin to the classic facemelting one at the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark. Actually, it might have been entertaining to see what would've happened to Steve's face had he gone too near a heat source.Add to this a forced performance by John 'Jim' Kraszinski, I love him in The Office but here he ironically seems to be presented as a comic relief to all the 'serious' stuff that's going on, and also add to this a terribly contrived scene at a party where the oldies get 'soooo wasted' off one or two puffs of a joint, a scene which ends up falling totally flat and just gets annoying, and you have a film I really had trouble sitting through.I hate films that give the viewer no credit whatsoever. We're just supposed to accept a lot of things when we watch certain comedies for the sake of a few laughs. This is certainly one of those. No laughs (for me anyway), bad dialogue, unrealistic characters that are impossible to like or relate to in any way, predictable plot, annoying children... doesn't get much worse than this.Avoid at all costs.",It's Complicated

Alec Baldwin and Meryl Streep do a great job in their roles and I found Steve Martin's character to be great too.The movie isn't just filled with laughs though - there are some truly poignant moments as well. Moments where you feel the pain the family has experienced and know that things might have turned out differently had they worked through earlier problems.I can't say the movie was perfect - there were things I wish hadn't been as prominent (drugs) and the way things end was a little confusing, but I genuinely enjoyed the acting, the character development, the realistic emotions within the family and more.Even the score was enjoyable.And, almost a week later, I still find myself laughing about a couple of the scenes.Not the greatest romantic comedy ever, but certainly worth seeing.",It's Complicated
121,doctorx2,It's Formulaic,3,24 October 2010,"Viewer beware, this is yet another Nancy Meyers testament to the inherent goodness of menopausal women. Recall that Meyers has written (and often produced) a series of cloying films chronicling the trials and tribulations of implausibly wealthy, successful women, beset by men who are at best emasculate and ineffectual, at worst selfish and venal, and often, both: The Holiday (2006); Something's Gotta Give (2003); The Parent Trap (1998); Father of the Bride Part II (1995); Father of the Bride (1991); Baby Boom (1987); and so on.In ""It's Complicated,"" viewers will not be surprised to find iconic ""chick flick"" heroine Meryl Streep in the role of Jane, an implausibly wealthy, successful woman, divorced for 11 years from the father of her three now-grown children. The youngest (girl) is off to college, the middle (boy) is graduating from college, and the oldest (girl) lives with her fiancé. The son and the son-in-law to be are harmless puppies, naive boy-men who openly adore Jane.Jane is, of course, beset by her selfish and venal ex-husband Jake, played with good humor and generosity by Alec Baldwin. Jake left Jane for the only character in a Nancy Meyers screenplay more execrable than a man, i.e., a younger woman: Agness, whose very name is unpleasant. Lest there be any doubt that older, wiser, good-hearted Jane is The Sympathetic Character and Agness is The Clutching Shrew, Jane is constantly in the process of preparing delectable food for others, while Agness's slinky costumes, snake-like undulations, bad make-up, and unsympathetic scripting transform the attractive actress Lake Bell into a repulsive harpy. Jane good. Agness bad. Got it? Jane's family lives in Santa Barbara, California, which looks a lot like Montecito, the most glamorous and exclusive part of Santa Barbara. A quick look at Jane's sprawling Spanish-style home lets us know that she is a multi-millionaire; learning that she bought the place with money from her divorce tells us that Jake has even more millions than she does. Why anyone would be interested in the personal affairs of people with this much money (besides themselves, of course) is utterly beyond me, but perhaps I lack imagination.Jake is, of course, a schmuck. That is his sole purpose in life; he just can't help it. A successful law partner, he almost never appears without his Porsche and necktie. Jake is unidimensionally charming in a smarmy but self-effacing way, sort of a guilty pleasure for women -- oh wait, that was Jack Nicholson in ""Something's Got to Give..."" oh, and it is Jake, too. I guess in Meyers films, one schmuck fits all.Jane's gal pals include a who's who of venerated best-girlfriend actresses: Mary Kay Place (best remembered as best girlfriend from Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman and ""The Big Chill""), Rita Wilson (terrifically talented and terribly under-utilized in film), and Nora Dunn (a Meryl Streep wannabe). The girls are all concerned about Jane's celibacy, and encourage her to do something reckless and unwise.As luck (or at least, Meyers) would have it, in the very next scene, Jake and Jane find themselves alone at the hotel bar in New York City where they have come for their son's college graduation. They immediately have drinks, a turn or two on the dance floor, and sex. Jane is riddled with guilt. So much guilt, in fact, that as soon as she is back home in Santa Barbara, she has sex with Jake again. Of course there is a moment of tension and humor when Jack -- err, I mean Jake, passes out and the doctor assures us he is okay.So -- Jane's affair with her ex-husband Jake is all good, until he stands her up for a date because his deranged, harping 30-something wife Agness unexpectedly cancels an evening out because she is (she announces) ""ovulating,"" and requires his participation in making a baby. That Agness -- what a selfish bitch! Jane is also beset by the emasculate and ineffectual architect Adam, who ""really gets"" what she was trying to convey in the 47 E-mails describing the Kitchen She Always Wanted. Adam is played by Steve Martin, whom Meyers fans may remember as the emasculate and ineffectual, though occasionally selfish and venal, Father of the Bride (I and II). It is difficult not to wince every time Adam is in a scene. Adam ends up the victim of another of Jane's lapses of judgment, not as the recipient of sex, but as her co-conspirator in smoking a joint before going to a graduation party for her son hosted by her oldest daughter and her fiancé. This, in case you are wondering, is intended as humor. It also provides an opportunity for the inevitable scene in which Jake stares, slack-jawed and sad-eyed, at Jane, after she has made it clear that she is done with him and has moved on (to Adam). Of course, Agness (boo, hiss) sees this and realizes that Jake is Still In Love With Jane Even After All These Years.Suffice to say that Jane is now left with a dilemma -- Jake won't leave Jane alone, and blunderingly reveals to Adam online that he is naked in Jane's bedroom -- another ""humorous"" scene. Fat, naked, middle-aged men now appear to be a requisite feature of Meyers films (""Something's Got to Give"" or SGTG). Apparently dumping men into swimming pools for no apparent reason (""The Parent Trap"") is no longer adequate humiliation for the selfish, venal, emasculate and ineffectual.The death stage of this film -- not unlike SGTG -- winds on endlessly, to its anticlimactic and ultimately disappointing conclusion, satisfying only to middle-aged female viewers, who are, after all, the target market here. This triumph of feminism was perhaps best illustrated by the audience (all over 50) departing the theater: women striding out confidently and happily, their defeated husbands trudging along four or five paces behind them.",It's Complicated

It doesn't make sense. Another big problem is the casting. Where on Earth did Nancy Meyers get the 3 kids of Baldwin-Streep? I think I could look at their pictures for hours, go out on the streets and meet them and I wouldn't recognize them! Insignificant. The moment they are off the screen I already forgot how they look like. In the extras of the DVD of SGG Nancy Meyers praises herself for having casted Amanda Peet (the daughter of the Diane Keaton character) because ""Amanda looks like a daughter"". Instead in this movie the children of Baldwin-Streep look like 3 idiots and that's all. Detestable.Is is a little hard for the audience to believe that Baldwin-Streep are having so much sex if on screen they don't even kiss each other on the cheek! Nicholson and Keaton did a great jog under that aspect in SGG. In the extra of the DVD all the actors were happy about how ""great"" everyone was and how much fun they had shooting the movie.

I think of them as the post-Seinfeld romantic comedies--little if any nuance, lots of OMG, & an insufferable dose of It's All About Me. This work is sophisticated and intelligent, more like the classic comedies of the past with more skin and contemporary language.It has often been said that it is more difficult to do comedy than drama, and I think this is true. In It's Complicated we see 1 actor who is extraordinary at both genres--Streep; 2 actors who are accomplished at comedy (& who can on occasion do serious) Martin & Baldwin; and a young man who, for the first time as far as I can see, may have the ability to outgrow his mugging serial persona and do something better than reincarnations of Jim in The Office or replications of what he is, a 30-ish, appealing young man--Krasinski.Alec Baldwin was a total hoot--so unashamed of his corpulence & willing to put it all out there, laugh at himself & invite us to laugh at him. There was a lot of laughter from the audience throughout the movie & I think it came from both women & men. Yes, I am over 50 & a widow. Yes seeing a movie where the female star has both great intelligence, beauty and wrinkles is balm to the spirit. Although I'm not in the market, I know how grim the prospects for finding someone to ""like a lot"" (as Martin says at one point) are.

127,airguitar57,Nancy Meyers does Nancy Meyers...again,6,19 June 2010,"Nancy Meyers is a writer/director who seems perfectly happy in her niche. It's Complicated is nothing new or special, being a retread of typical Meyers fare. Despite its uninspired story, the casting gods smile upon the film, with Meryl Streep, Alec Baldwin, Steve Martin and surprise, John Krasinski collectively keeping the comedic ship afloat.The story centers on Jane (Streep), owner of a successful bakery in California. Jane has been divorced from her ex-husband Jake (Baldwin), an attorney, for 10 years. Having raised their three children, Jake and Jane have finally achieved a good relationship between each other. While in New York City for her son's graduation, Jane goes to the bar to have a drink. Also at the bar is Jake, who is flying solo since his wife Agness (Lake Bell) has decided to stay home. The two have several drinks together and eventually wind up in Jake's hotel room. The night of debauchery reignites the passion the two once had, and they continue their affair upon their return to California. To make matters worse, Jane has started to become interested in an architect, Adam (Martin) who is working on the addition to her home. The rest of the film follows this love triangle through all of its twists and turns.The film's biggest problems are in its generalities. At this point, it seems like Meyers is getting lazily and repeating herself. There are many scenes that feel like rip-offs of her earlier films The Parent Trap, The Holiday and quite often, Something's Gotta Give. There is one point in which a moment of foreplay between Jake and Jane results in Jake collapsing due in what looks like a heart attack. If this sounds like something you've seen before, trust me you have. In Something's Gotta Give, a moment of foreplay results in a heart attack for Jack Nicholson's character.I don't know if Meyers was ever wronged by a man, but her films often feature the infidelity of a male character despite being in a relationship with an uber-successful woman. Even though the man is the reason for the woman's unrest, he finds joy while she continues to suffer. It feels trite. Another theme that is often seen in Meyers's films is the older man's desire to be with younger women. I know that it happens in real life, but it feels tired, especially in the case of Meyers's work. Also, everyone is professionally successful. Jake is an attorney who is now partner at his law firm, Jane runs an upscale bakery and Adam is some prodigy of architecture. Is it necessary for them to be great successes? Probably not, but Meyers takes such care to ensure that the audience is aware of their successes. Professional success is something that Meyers seems to feel obligated to give to her characters and I'm not entirely sure why.With all its problems, the film still manages to be fairly funny. I attribute the moments of humor to the cast. The dialogue they have to work with is nothing special, but they manage to do as much as they can with the little they are given. I'm not even giving all the credit to the trio of Baldwin, Streep and Martin. My favorite character in the film was Harley (Krasinski), the husband of Jane and Jake's oldest daughter. Krasinski gets the best lines and has the most entertaining story. I knew that if Krasinski was in the scene somehow it was going to be better. Moreover, he is probably the best representation of a good guy in the whole film. Don't get me wrong, Baldwin, Streep and Martin all have their moments but Krasinski steals the show.It's Complicated is perfectly happy being a middling romantic comedy. The writing is mediocre and the story is predictable, but the acting isn't half-bad. The actors are able to save characters that easily could disappear into nothingness. The premise would make for a good 90-minute film, unfortunately, at 2 hours it is overlong. Occasionally boring, It's Complicated is entertaining and occasionally funny, but overall is nothing special.",It's Complicated
128,Harried Howie,"At last, a romantic comedy for adults!",9,6 August 2010,"I could have summarized this picture as ""a romantic comedy for mature adults,"" but I did not want to scare younger viewers away from this excellent picture. Streep is an incredibly talented actress whose beauty has actually increased with her age. She is sexier at 60 than she was at 30. Alec Baldwin is underrated as an actor. He delivers his lines as well as any actor, but his ability to act with facial expression alone is unmatched in Hollywood today. Steve Martin, no longer the ""wild and crazy guy,"" is now the sympathetic everyman. I watched this movie with a female friend. Neither of us is prone to outbursts of laughter, but one scene involving Baldwin and Martin got belly laughs from both of us. The plot is plausible, if barely so, and while the picture doesn't scream for a sequel, it's easy to picture one. Two weak points were the ""Harley"" character who seemed to be living his life in the 1950s; and Zoe Kazan, playing a role written for an actress ten years younger than herself, who didn't appear to be acting in the same film as all the other actors.",It's Complicated
129,jeannel2003-618-511281,Not Very Complicated,5,30 May 2010,"Nancy Meyers's latest offering about midlife romance is pleasant and interesting at times, but lacks the spark, energy, pathos, passion, and, yes, romance, of her earlier masterpieces, ""Something's Gotta Give,"" and ""Baby Boom,"" both starring the adorable and talented Diane Keaton.Although ""It's Complicated,"" has the astonishingly talented Meryl Streep, who has turned in a plethora of brilliant performances, she managed to phone this one in as the movie's heroine, Jane. And, the two characters who are supposed to be helping to make the romantic entanglements complicated are played flatly by Lake Bell and Steve Martin, both of whom have never been less alluring. There was no magnetism in either character to create a dilemma and conflict for the main characters. No wonder the attractive, vigorous and very sexy middle-age ex-husband, played by Alec Baldwin, fled from his vacuous and shrewish young wife – whose only thing going for her is a tall, lean body – and her bratty kid back into the arms of his intelligent. attractive and fun to be with wife, who also happens to be a professional foodie. And, it is no surprise that said ex-wife would find her upbeat and sexy ex-husband more appealing than the only other obviously available man, her architect who seems to be suffering from Botox paralysis and terminal dullness; it's one thing to be charmingly shy and sexy, quite another to be catatonic. In contrast, the heroine of ""Something's Gotta Give"" had a real conflict and choices: to remain alone with her fabulous career and the company of her adult daughter and dynamic sister or choose between a dashing young doctor who sweeps her off her feet or a sexy rugged individualist who plays hard to get. And, there's the point -- ""It's Complicated"" really isn't complicated, it's pretty sterile, while ""Something's Gotta Give"" was deliciously complicated, engaging and achingly romantic. In both ""Something's Gotta Give"" and ""Baby Boom,"" Diane Keaton's characters were complex and nuanced -- reminiscent of Katherine Hepburn characters, where Meryl Streep's character in ""It's Complicated"" was sweet, pretty, wholesome and motherly - reminiscent of Doris Day's characters.Another problem I had with ""It's Complicated"" was the inclusion of four women friends, all of whom except the wonderful Rita Wilson seemed clichéd and one-dimensional, rather than the one strong friend or sister, such as Frances McDormand's caustic and intellectual sister of the heroine in ""Something's Gotta Give."" Finally, Jane's children were too perfect – consistently well-mannered, polite to each other, respectful of their parents – automatons rather than the way children act. Had they behaved like real children, Jane's affair with her ex-husband – or anyone for that matter – would really have been complicated.I recommend seeing ""It's Complicated"" once or maybe twice. However, it simply is not in the same class as ""Something's Gotta Give"" or ""Baby Boom,"" both of which I have watched dozens of times. I think that's the real test of the quality and value of a movie – how many times can you view it and laugh or cry just as hard as you did the first time.",It's Complicated
130,dickklip,It's...not very good,6,2 March 2010,"Unfortunately, ""It's complicated"" really isn't, being the story of a love triangle (sort of) between a divorced couple (Baldwin and Streep),who still feel some sparks, and the ""complications"" with a new beau (Martin), that the woman has met. It's an old, hackneyed plot, done one more time. Although I really like all the lead actors, it's really a waste of talent for Meryl Streep and Steve Martin, but Alec Baldwin does carry the day, and steal the show. It is he, not Streep who deserves attention for his role. Without him and good support from John Krasinski, it's really a nothing movie. I really wanted to like this movie, but it reminded me a a 60's comedy ala Rock Hudson and Doris Day, only with 50 somethings in the role. There are some chuckles, but not many laughs, and it seems dated and too slow. Also, even though I'm in my 50s, the thought and sight of fifty somethings necking and having sex is just downright disgusting! This might be a good movie to watch on pay per view, or via other rental, but I wouldn't waste the money on the price of a theater ticket.",It's Complicated

The idea of 50- somethings rediscovering love is a novel idea for a film.But the film was terrible, contrived and more predictable than anything I'd seen in years. It made ""You've got mail"" seem like a Tarantino film. There wasn't one ounce of truth or honesty in this film. It was pure Marshmello Fluff from the start, touching every possible clique out there. Meryl Streep's character was tossed aside for the younger woman who turns out to be a b**ch after she marries Alec Baldwin's character. Meryl has a nice, tight (all white) circle of girlfriends who encourage her affair. The kids are all perfect, but are confused by the re-engagement of their divorced parents. The whole pot smoking scene was milked dry of any element of humor. How could one joint last so long and get so many people high? Even though a film is a piece of fiction, it still must be true. The emotions, the dialog and the characters must be in some way reflect something real and honest. A good example of that is the film my wife and I enjoyed the following night on TV -- ""Gross Pointe Blank"". It's also a Rom-Com, and although the plot is more preposterous, nearly every character and conversation rang more true than anything in ""It's Complicated.""

135,ncoviell,It really IS complicated,6,19 February 2010,"Never has a title spoken such truths about a movie. I, like many viewers, was on the fence throughout the entire movie. For one, the characters aren't sure how they feel about anything and the audience, going off the characters actions and decisions, has a hard time deciding whether they like the characters or now. The best example is Alec Baldwin's character, Jack. Over ten years ago, he destroyed his marriage with his wife Jane (Meryl Streep) by cheating on her. Strike number one. Not only does he cheat, but he ends up marrying the woman he had the affair with, who is much younger than him and has a five year old son. Strike number two. Then, over ten years later, Jake hooks back up with Jane while they're up in New York for her son's graduation and wants to rekindle the relationship. Strike number three. Yes, judging off that one can assume that Jake is a real asshole; however, it is made apparent that he truly does still love Jane and the connection he has with his kids (at times) makes it hard to dislike the guy. Then there's Jane who is just being dragged alone on this roller coaster as she isn't sure whether she still has feelings for her ex-husband or if she wants to give her architect (Steve Martin) a shot. What the viewer gets out of all this is basically a teen comedy of today, only lacking the teens and involving middle-age adults. Unfortunately for It's Complicated, it can't decide whether it's going to be a shallow film, or a film ending in good taste. While some scene definitely produce laughs (Such as any scene with John Krasinski), others fall face first (such as the nude Alec Baldwin scene). Overall, It's Complicated is simply a Rom-com with a twist of characters, who, aside from the three leads and Krasinski, are almost artificial and several of their lines are obviously scripted. Steve Martin is underutilized and the final fourth of the film is just sappy.",It's Complicated

We were both laughing so loud and so hard, we missed a couple of lines, so I will be happy to get the DVD in the future. Alec Baldwin was amazing! He should have got billing above Steve Martin. Meryl Streep was fantastic, as always. The chemistry between the two was natural feeling and fantastic. So good, in fact, it made me seriously question the end.

After the film, on re-reading those reviewer's comments (and doing a little research into their background) I realized that they just didn't get the film because they hadn't lived the life experiences shown in this movie, life experience counts toward your ability to really grasp what the characters are going through (so when someone misses the boat on this film I honestly believe it's because they haven't had that sort of a complicated closure to a relationship). This film was well worth watching! For comparison, a friend and I saw Up in the Air and It's Complicated together, hands down we thought It's Complicated was the more entertaining of the two. Not to take anything away from Up In The Air, it's a movie worth watching (and in a big theater), but for pure entertainment we put our money on It's Complicated.Nancy Meyers always does some sort of a distinctive look in her films, loved the sets and wardrobe, the sets are featured in Traditional Home and on their website.

139,gwynjones2001,Annoying Chick Flick!,6,10 January 2010,"Nancy Meyers writes (and directs) these glossy California movies for wealthy, divorced, older women. Diane Keaton in Something's Gotta Give, and now Meryl Streep in It's Complicated. Diane had a nice, multi-million dollar house by the beach... now Meryl has a fancy, multi-million dollar home in sunny Santa Barbara... which needs a big extension from Hollywood architect Steve Martin. Honestly, I find it difficult to rustle up much sympathy for the travails of affluent LA-suburban women.The central conceit of this movie (and Something's Gotta Give before it), is that men are cheating idiots, who leave their wonderful wives (and lovely children) for younger women. But secretly ache for a nice, clever, mature (60-ish), divorced woman (like Diane, Meryl, or, indeed, I suspect, Nancy Meyers herself). I don't know which California Nancy is describing, but in the one I've seen, guys trade in their wife for a younger model... and then a few years later, trade her in for an even younger one. I don't see any trend where guys like Alec Baldwin (in this movie), or Jack Nicolson (in Something's Gotta Give), really want to give up their bodacious 30-something wife/girlfriend... for a 60-something stylish divorcée. But I can see why, for certain women (like Nancy and her many fans), this version of the world is much more appealing than reality.In Something's Gotta Give, Jack Nicolson sees the light, and ditches his hot young babe, for her wonderful mom. In It's Complicated, Alec ditches his hot young babe, for a wonderful mom and older career woman... who's (oh, it's so complicated!) is his EX wife, who he dumped many years before.Leaving aside the glossy materialism, and the fundamental mismatch with reality, Nancy gets great actors involved like Diane Keaton and Jack Nicolson... or, in this case, Meryl Streep and Alec Baldwin. Both are excellent in this movie, especially Alec Baldwin, who's charming and funny... even if he is a cheating (twice) love rat. So even if the premise is total tosh, the actors are enjoyable to watch. In this movie, they are joined by Steve Martin (playing serious), and John Krasinski (from The Office).Alec and Meryl are enjoyable to watch, so I didn't get up and leave. But, like Something's Gotta Give before it, I personally find these movies irritating and unfunny. However, to be fair, there was a lot of laughter, so I think, for some, this is a funny, insightful movie. I'd guess the Nancy demographic is white, American, female. With extra enjoyment value for older well-off women. Definitely a Chick Flick!",It's Complicated

Our group were late 20's and early 30's and were the youngest in the theatre, but age shouldn't discourage you from seeing this film.A mature look at divorce and sex, this film doesn't hold back. It's main characters (played by Meryl Streep and Alec Baldwin) are well fleshed out and dynamic. Secondary characters are poorly written and directed. The children (with the exception of the son-in-law - who if not realistic is entertaining and believable) are not fleshed out at all, nor are they are realistic portrayal of children in their 20s. Steve Martin's character is better written than the other secondary characters, however it is easy to tell that Nancy Meyers' passion lied in the characters acted by Meryl and Alec.I still thoroughly enjoyed this film and would highly recommend it for anyone in the mood for a laugh.

141,bradleysmith1996,It's Complicated Review,6,1 January 2010,It's Complicated Review Now let me start off by saying if you are not a fan of Meryl streep or Alec Baldwin then you should probably avoid this film. If you are you will probably love it. If you're like me and are in between then you will probably think the same as me.It's complicated features two fairly decent leads who can carry a film well. The beginning of the film is very boring and gives you the wrong impression of the film. As the film progresses it gets more interesting and far more funny. The scene where Meryl streep and Steve martin go to the party is hilarious. (I won't spoil it.) Sadly the middle is the highlight of the film because the end turns into a bit of a drama. However you have to take it as it is and enjoy it as it is. And what it is is hilarious.6/10,It's Complicated
142,learningthelingo,"A complicated experience, but not a complicated film",8,13 January 2010,"For me, it was an aptly complicated experience seeing Nancy Meyer's It's Complicated. Being a long time fan of Meyer's work, starting with Father of the Bride (for me that is, her screen writing career officially started with Private Benjamin in 1980) I did not hesitate in seeing her latest on screen venture. I shall get onto the actual film itself in a second, but before I do so, I do have to chronicle the experience of a 21 year-old male (albeit cinema studies graduate) attending such a screening.So naturally, going up to the ticket box is a nervy and testing time when seeing a film that possibly questions your sanity, sexuality and chances of ever getting with the box office girl. And this time proved to be no exception. There was of course a pretty girl standing there waiting for patrons. Up I came, and then uttered the words ""Could I get a ticket to It's Complicated at 3.30?"" I'll give the girl credit, as she hid her amusement, disappointment, and or general humiliation on my part fairly well, but I could still see that air of """" Thinking that this was the height of the embarrassment when seeing a film that is marketed and mostly attended by the middle aged women category, I entered the cinema with slight trepidation, but with thoughts that it's not like it could get any worse. I was wrong. I entered the cinema fairly early (probably the first mistake) to which I see a moderately populated sea of mostly 60+ women. As I walk across the front of the cinema (second mistake) almost parading in front of them to get to the furthest place from the door in which I entered (third mistake). I am noticed and it was not my paranoid neurotic brain that was imagining this, because as I ascended the stairs I am loudly greeted with ""Oh, he's back again!"" The first place my mind goes is ""Shit, they've seen me come into a similarly older aged marketed film alone, and they haven't forgotten me!"" Naturally, this was not the case, as it turns out I was mistaken for a cinema usher. One who they thought had returned to come and chat to them (because that's what teenage cinema ushers love to do in their spare time).As I positioned myself in the furthest reaches of the galaxy (or the theatre) I could hear little mutterings from the previous encounter of old ladies that went something along the lines of ""Oh, isn't he cute."" Emotionally unstable and feeling partly dejected from my youth, manhood and general sensibilities, I was probably in the most appropriate mood for seeing a Nancy Meyers film. Vulnerability is something that is so central to most of her leading characters, so naturally, I was in the right place.In her latest piece, Meyer's has Meryl Streep playing Jane, a baker who after 10 years of being a divorcée has taken control of her life, is about to start major renovations to her house, and then out of the blue, has an affair with her ex husband Jake (played to perfection by Alec Baldwin). But at the same time, she starts to fall for her divorced architect (played also to perfection by Steve Martin) and thus is born the decision of who to pick.It's Meyer's characters that are of particular interest. She creates perfectly flawed, vulnerable and detailed people. What's also interesting about these characters is that we see the reasoning behind their affluence. Similar to Father of the Bride, Baby Boom, What Women Want and Something's Gotta Give, the main characters are successful people. But in these films, we see their workplaces, thus establishing a plausible logic behind the rather large affluent surroundings that the characters exist in. In It's Complicated, Jane is a baker. We learn that Jane went to Paris in her early 20s for a short cooking course and ended up staying on as an apprentice baker. We see Jane make copious amounts of food, including the start to finish process of the makings of a chocolate croissant. This placement of food, which could possibly be a character of the film itself, features a commonality with Streep's other 2009 release, Nora Ephron's Julie and Julia. And the food looks delectable and irresistible too! The three stars of the film shine. There are scenes that remind me of this 180 degree turn of the feminist film ""male triple gaze"" theory, with Baldwin being the one who is gazed upon, and not necessarily as a sex symbol, but at a point of amusement and comic relief. Diane Keaton's nude 3 second appearance in Something's Gotta Give can slightly be compared, in so far as the comic relief idea, but the difference is that she looked great, whereas Baldwin's character is shown to be the result of 10 years without Meryl Streep's character. Steve Martin for the most part of the film plays the straight guy, with the exception of one hilarious drug induced scene, and it is wonderful to see Martin almost playing against type. Both he and Baldwin bravely show such deep unexpected vulnerability, and thus create the decision of Streep's character seem all the more challenging. Streep herself, is a powerhouse too and proves why she was nominated for a Golden Globe in the performance (where she faces stiff competition from Sandra Bullock, Julia Roberts, Marion Cotillard and of course.herself in Julie and Julia.) So while it was a complicated experience seeing It's Complicated, there were no complications at all in sitting back and being entertained by the best.",It's Complicated

144,srfm79,It's not all that complicated (as a movie).,6,7 January 2010,"""It's Complicated"" is marketed as yet another movie in the ""mature people discovering things about themselves through funny, awkward situations in a down-to-earth but heart warming fashion"" vein. Does it deliver? Well, yes, it is not badly done, but it is also quite formulaic, and if you have watched the last couple of movies with Diane Keaton as a woman discovering herself after meta-pause, there are a lot of situations that will not be all that surprising.On the plus-side, the acting is good. Streep is funnier than the script, adding wonderful mimic to several scenes, and Baldwin is a joy to watch making fun of his aging, not-so- well-kept body. He and Streep are well cast opposite each other, never stealing the scenes for themselves. I am also now officially a fan of John Krasinski whose work in ""Away We Go"" was wonderful. He highlights his comic talent in a small, but charming role as the boyfriend of one of Streep and Baldwin's daughters. Steve Martin is a really good actor that is unfortunately too seldomly used for quasi-serious roles as here. (Last time I remember him doing that was in Lawrence Kasdan's bleak ""Grand Canyon"".) He is an interesting choice for a character that is not un-funny, but not hilarious either, in a movie that is, taken as a whole, a comedy.The film did succeed in making me laugh several times (although not all the time) and for that I would always credit a movie with a grade above average or higher, when the funny moments are intentional, as they are here.

Should they separate it is their duty to reunite should that be possible. To find Streep's character throw away this chance was extremely disappointing and shows how some people are so selfish they refuse to live out their role even in the best of circumstances. With acting, directing and scripting skills obviously abundant; this movie had the unique opportunity to show the benefits to an entire family of reuniting. Instead it just showed the dismal reality that is played out all too often in movies, TV and real life.

Unfortunately, none of the characters surprise us with their development, the supporting characters are caricatures and it all feels a bit predictable. Streep and Baldwin are both excellent and the film is worth a DVD view for their performances alone. Streep in particular does a lot of work to carry the film, great presence and subtlety and her chemistry with Baldwin is terrific. I wanted to like Martin but he never convinced until the party scene. And as everyone notes, John Krasinski is just a scene-stealer wherever he shows up. Everyone else could be replaced with cardboard cutouts without much drop-off (not always because of the performances, there just isn't much to work with).All in all you could spend a worse evening in front of a romcom, there are a few genuinely funny moments and it's not bad.

I don't think it's fair for a movie goer to have to work at understanding a film because the enjoyment is just not there then. Continuity. Does Nancy know the meaning of the word? What a mixed up collection of little snippets from here and there.One thing that continued in the back of my mind was the two days Nancy Myers spent in Santa Barbara shooting this thing. I don't know who manages her budget but someone needs to do some reining in when a mere 1.65 seconds of film time was ever used out of two days of throwing money around a couple of sets. No wonder Hollywood has to go shoot out of the country when they clearly have no plan before they start shooting.Steve Martin looked over made up (make up--less make up PLEASE!) while I know that Meryl Streep could do so much better with a decent storyline.

And why not? I have read some article in some movie magazine saying that this is supposedly a film with a relatively small budget aimed at a relatively small audience (aforementioned ladies) but why would that be? I could not have been the only one in the audience who has no similarities with the film's characters: I am not nearing 60 years of age, I am not divorced, I have no children, I am not having an affair. Yet I do have a sense of humour and that is really all that is required when watching ""It's Complicated"".Because boy, this movie is funny as hell.

Was she told that the ex-husband and the architect roles were going to be played by other actors? Did they offer her an obscene amount of money? Does she have an ""evil"" agent? Whatever the reason, seeing this movie is proof of nothing so much as ""if you are going to hire Meryl Streep, you had better have some capable players on board as well."" Alec Baldwin and Steve Martin don't have a chance in this film. Seeing Ms. Streep in this film, in their company, was like seeing Mt. Everest suddenly dropped down onto Kansas wheat field country.Everything is green, flat and boring and then - suddenly - you have Everest. The film suffers most from a lack of good pace and timing. Streep can do great comedy, but Baldwin's and Martin's efforts here are negligible, even ludicrous. The three actors cast as Streep's children are sweet eye candy, but the script (writing) has them behaving as infants instead of the young adults they are supposed to be. This film falls into the category of ""chick flick"" for many reasons (if the appearance on screen of Rita Wilson didn't clue you in, turn in your badge), the first of which is that Ms. Streep does her usual excellent job at reigning in her nuclear talent to serve a giggling, juvenile script that should get more serious treatment; shame on the writer/director for that. Shame on Baldwin and Martin for trying to fob off double-takes and raised eyebrows as comedic style, especially in the face of Ms. Streep. And, finally, shame on Ms. Streep's evil agent for talking her into this, for taking the money, for misrepresenting the role distribution and for trying to transplant Mt. Everest.",It's Complicated

It was so gross having to watching alec in heat and meryl acting like a giggling school girl. Meryl's character was silly and immature. I love romcom movies and this was not it. Meryl has not been picking good movies over the last couple of years. maybe because there's not a lot to pick from. I totally stayed away from mama mia. Did anyone notice how alec (dad) paid zero attention to his kids and they didn't pay any attention to him. that was another place where the story fell apart. Also, her character was so perfect, so why didn't she find anyone over the past ten years? Alec left her for another woman and she has no anger towards him and feels bad for being an adulterer? And he was going to have a baby with a woman (lake bell) who cheated on him and had a kid with someone else. wouldn't ya think meryl's character would question her ex's lack of self confidence or moral values.

154,cliffgold-1,"Conflicted about ""Complicated""",6,25 December 2009,"I am conflicted about ""It's Complicated."" As you would expect, the acting is impeccable. Three exceptional actors (Queen Meryl, 30 Rock's Emmy winner Alec Baldwin, and Steve Martin) ply their craft perfectly. She is Jane, a late-50s divorcée, luxury bakery owner, and mother of three grown kids. Jake (Baldwin) is the cad of an ex-husband who remarried a much younger woman, Agness (played by Lake Bell) but who remains close to the kids and even to Jane. Martin plays Adam, the architect who has designed Jane's dream home addition, which includes the kitchen she always wanted (a nod to her turn as Julia Child in Julie & Julia). When the whole family goes to New York for the youngest child's graduation, the chick flick begins. The kids go off to a party, leaving Jane to dine by herself in the hotel restaurant/bar. Jake is there alone, too, since his wife and her precocious son conveniently stayed home when the kid got sick. Surprise! Jane and Jake end up drinking and eating at the bar, having a good old time and landing in the sack. The PG bedroom scenes are the best in the movie.As the trailer depicts, the two start an unusual affair, she feeling guilt, he having second thoughts about his new marriage. Jane confides in her best friends (played by all-star veterans Rita Wilson, Mary Kay Place and Alexandra Wentworth), who are totally superfluous to the film, and her shrink, all of whom encourage her to pursue her indiscretion. Enter Adam, a wild and sensitive guy, as the nice guy Jane needs. He and Baldwin are polar opposites. By now, we all know where the film is headed.So what's not to like? Plenty. Writer/director Nancy Meyers hates philandering men. Fine. So why is Jane's character painted so sympathetically? She's doing the same thing to Agness that broke up her marriage and sent her into a 10-year skid. Meyers, who also directed chick flicks ""What Women Want,"" ""Something's Gotta Give,"" and ""The Holiday,"" lets the movie lag for almost 20 minutes in the middle. I wanted to scream: Move it along! The film doesn't hit its stride until 75 minutes in, propelled by an unlikely scene where Jane and Adam share a joint and make fools of themselves at a party. Lastly, just when you think the movie is going to give you an unconventional ending, it doesn't. I adore the actors, like the genre, bought the premise, and ultimately was disappointed.",It's Complicated
155,ecbarth,Good but inconsistent at times,7,6 January 2010,"I give this movie an eight for watchability but have to bump it down to a 7 after taking the writing's sketchiness into consideration. Which is two things. The intentions of Meryl streeps character and those of her children.The movie itself flowed really well, Steve Martin and Alec Baldwin both have good on screen chemistry with streep, Alec Baldwin as the very charming ex-husband, who is remembering what he's lost resenting his current marriage,wants to reconnect with his wife and family, and Steve Martin as the likable newly divorcée who is competing with Baldwin for the affection of Streep who is finally enjoying life and feeling normal since her divorce and is experimenting with the new feelings she feels for both men.The inconsistencies come firstly in Streep when she is enjoying the affair but then flips like a coin and the explanation is weak at best, which makes her relationship with Baldwin come off as what I'm pretty is different than the writers original intent. You end up sympathizing more with the ex-husband while he futilely tries to win her back than with her as she pursues her other love interest. This sympathy misdirection messes with the overall effect of the film and makes the ending awkward, as Baldwin is left out in the cold and everything works out fine for Streep Secondly, The kids are all over the place in this,In the beginning the kids keep talking about how great it is having thefamily together then in the second half completely get weirded out at the idea and break down crying, which cuts to a very awkward scene with streep and her kids where she apologizes for confusing them. Furthering that awkaward shift in the movie, the kids who once supported the idea flip adding to how alone Baldwin is in his feelings to get back with his wife and family. Which in the end leaves you more sorry for Baldwin than StreepThe movie itself was very watchable and entertaining, the on screen chemistry is very enjoyable to watch.

This film suffers from an identity crisis; it's unclear exactly what kind of story it's telling. There were definitely a couple laugh-out-loud moments, and the film does an excellent job of putting you in the world of the characters; but because of the mostly singular storyline and ankle-deep manner in which the writer waded into the subject matter, this is mostly a shallow, one-dimensional piece that barely scratched the surface of where it could have gone. The film is carried mostly by the stellar performances of the leading cast--Meryl Streep & Alec Baldwin make for a wining duo of ex-spouses--but unfortunately, that's about where it ends. The picture that the screenwriter paints is unclear. It goes from being a drama told through the eyes of Streep, then has comedic elements, then veers back into a drama like an 18-wheeler being driven by a driver who fell asleep at the wheel. And the ending was unsatisfying and ambiguous. In short, I found it to be entertaining and enthralling in places, but the writer didn't venture very far into the lead characters' dilemmas, resulting in a basically flat, one- dimensional story, which as far as I'm concerned is the kiss of death for any story. As done, it seems more suitable to a half hour sitcom than a two hour feature. The only reason to see this is to watch fine performances by Streep & Baldwin. But overall it tries to be something that it isn't, and doesn't achieve what it set out to do. The writer gave only cursory nods in the direction of the characters' dilemmas, whereas she could have taken it much, much further. For me, watching this movie felt kind of like drinking a diet soda: it's wet and tastes a little sweet, but ultimately it contains only one calorie and the sweetness is artificial.",It's Complicated

He was so powerful, equally powerful Meryl Streep couldn't really stand in his way. Baldwin will now be sought after for roles in romantic comedies. He's not Cary Grant but he's just as good as Cary at what he does. Billy Crystal and Jack Nicholson are not in the same league with him. Alec has apparently always been a funny guy. The R-rated dope-smoking scene was very funny. I went to this film expecting that I would be able to avoid laughing, because often, these so-called comedies aren't really funny. Baldwin made it impossible not to laugh. Baldwin and Streep, a divorced couple who've secretly been getting it on again, are interrupted by their twenty something son who has become aware of what they're doing., just as the lovers are about to light up a roach. The twosome somehow have to include the son as sort of a way to pledge him to secrecy from the other kids. The roach is of course more powerful that those weak-kneed sixties roaches One serious hit and one is looped instantly, here where we live now on the verge of a mary jane renaissance coast-to-coast, via medicinal marijuana. The scene is hilarious, particularly when Alec, with roach between lips, leans close blowing a wisp of j-smoke into the mouth of his son who begins a coughing jag that becomes a running gag. The film's attitude about divorce is controversial too in a supposedly religious America where recent surveys reveal that Americans put their religious practices together from a smörgåsbord of different beliefs rather than swallowing an entire religious dinner. Alec is married to a babe just hitting 40 while he and Meryl are roughly the same age (very roughly, Alex is about 52 and Meryl 60). Alex doesn't feel the least bit like a cheat and Meryl isn't bothered either by the specter of Streep's young wife having a child from an earlier marriage, named Pedro, or that she is taking hormones and Alex is compelled to perform in between his tet-a-tets with Meryl. Its Complicated has no moral compass about the cheating at all. Alec is such a tour deforce that he sweeps those issues away with a toss of his hand. And Meryl, now in a position to get even with the woman who took her hubby away ten years earlier, is fine with the arrangement too. Alec even gets away with casting Pedro, who would normally be an engaging nine year old, as a villain, getting in the way of his cheating, when the nosy kid figures out that Alec has stepped fully clad into the shower behind the closed bathroom door, to make a phone call from his cell to Meryl. The three grown up children of Meryl and Alex are on board spiritually too. Even though their teenage lives were ruined by the divorce, they are simpatico to the affair as the truth gradually dawns.

Streep, Baldwin and Martin are fantastic actors, of course, and they do the best with what they're given, but I still wasn't drawn in or convinced by the movie.Also, this was one of those irritating instances in which the previews billed the film as a snappy comedy, when it turned out to be more of a tearjerker-reconciliation-self-love deal.

Not only is this man a breached whale, but his constant whispering tone of voice through the entire movie is truly driving you up the wall. I felt pity for Meryl Streep to pretend to be in love with a hippopotamus like Baldwin. Just shows you what a convincing actress she is. LOL! I mean, of all actors in Hollywood, this is the only option they had, playing against a great ace like Streep? Give the man a pool to fart and float in so he can stay upright. Had it been a woman looking like that, they would NEVER have cast her as a love interest to anyone. And guess what? It was equally difficult to see the attraction for Baldwin in the role of a lover.If you can get beyond The Baldwin Fa(c)tor, its a cute movie with a lot of funny pointers. Nancy Meyers does a great job in bringing a real cozy family closeness to the screen. You can really understand the loss the hippopotamus (Baldwin) feels after cheating on his wife, getting a divorce, and losing his whole family.

181,vivahollywood,It's Hilarious,10,31 December 2009,"First of all, let me say that I am a biased Streep-fan, but this was truly my favorite film of the year (Avatar makes a close second). I know many people look at the cast and the story line and think ""oh, that's an *older* people film"". They are completely wrong! I'm only 21, have never been married or divorced, nor do I truly understand the pains of 'growing old', but I could still sympathize with all the characters in this film, thanks to the brilliant writing and amazing actors. I was surprised at how funny this film was--everyone in the theater was rolling with laughter! Halfway through the movie, my companion whispered ""I already want to watch it again!"" I really enjoyed the look of the film as well. Big thumbs up for great set design and costuming.The casting was perfect--everyone was superbly chosen. Steve Martin is absolutely adorable in this role, and his puppy-dog eyes make your heart break--I haven't seen him play a character with so much depth in a long time, and I was reminded of how great an actor he truly is. He definitely held his own against the formidable Ms. Streep. Alec Baldwin was hands-down hilarious, and you actually had sympathy for his character as well, which only made the ""choice"" so much harder (because you know that in every movie like this, you've already chosen who you think would be best within the first 30 minutes). I can honestly say that I didn't want Meryl's character to choose, simply because I knew it would be heartbreaking either way. Meryl Streep was her usual brilliant self. This isn't one of her career-defining dramatic roles, but I enjoyed seeing her actually have fun, much like in Mamma Mia. She was so alive in this film, and it was a treat to watch her.All in all, this a movie you should see at least once, if not three times. Nancy Meyer does an excellent job once more, and it's a definite must-have for my collection.",It's Complicated
182,mgallant-6,Really enjoyed,9,7 February 2010,"I did not expect much and thought that the movie exceeded my expectations. It disappoints me that people would bother to vote and give the movie 1 star. C'mon people let's be fair here. I would give it 7.5 to 8 out of 10 but will add a star to make up for crazily low ratings. Was the movie that predictable? No more then anything else and how it ended was not a bad way to end it. How should it end? With regards to people having an issue with adultery and Streep having the affair with Baldwin...that was what the whole moving was about and anyone would know that going in. It did not seem like it was entered lightly and without some soul searching.The movie was geared towards a more ""mature"" audience and struck a chord with me. It showed the issues with getting older, sometimes thinking there is always something better out there and coming to grips with mistakes. Dealing with what happens to your body as you age( I found Streep and Baldwin refreshingly not self-conscious about flaunting what they have). And it also showed the fallout from what happens when people are selfish and how it affects others. The kids reactions was what I think happens. I like all of the actors so maybe I am biased but with the lower ratings my expectations were set low. Baldwin is over the top but it is what he does and nobody does it better. Streep and Martin are always good and I think Krasinski is always great....like ""The Office he makes the most of that camera glance.All in all, a lot of fun and I would have no hesitation to recommend",It's Complicated

That being said, I was pleasantly surprised by this very entertaining and appealing movie helmed by a veteran Nancy Meyers.Although Meryl Streep's performance here is not as showy as in Julie & Julia, her subtle yet plausible comedic acting as a confused divorcée is pitch-perfect in every scene. It's a no brainer to assume that she will be competing against herself at Golden Globe.I am sure this film will be a commercial success and it will solidify Meryl's Oscar chance in March.

As a teenager myself I assure you, it is NOT meant only for old people although it may be a feel good movie for elderly people. The actors were undoubtedly great but the ending was quiet predictable.

187,grant-graham,Terrible Script,1,30 April 2010,"This movie is a chic flick that is custom-tailored to the insecurities of older women (obviously the target audience). It reduced Alec Baldwin's role to a woman's cliché about men, in that all it takes is one great lay and they fall in love. He isn't a person but rather a prop without a personality. The script is garbage written from a woman's point of view in that protagonist (Streep) shouldn't be accountable for any of her actions: 1. Baldwin leaves Streep for a bimbo (his fault), 2. Baldwin marries the bimbo after the bimbo screws around and has another man's child (so Baldwin and Streep are not accountable to the young family they are about to destroy), 3. Baldwin courts Streep after Streep tries to renounce (again making Streep blameless), 4. Oh what the hell, it's OK to have an affair as she was married to Baldwin before, so who is to blame? (story premise), 5. Meryl's friends all exalt and act happy that she's having an affair, even before they realize it's with her ex-husband (Who can blame her? She isn't accountable as she needed sex). In the battle of the sexes, men complain that women have no sense of accountability. This script is shamelessly contrived, and provides an unintended support of that frequent male complaint.What compelled me to watch the movie was the cast, as I greatly admire Meryl Streep and the comic genius of Steve Martin. Yet they were both wasted as the movie lacked humor and insight. The script approached the insecurities of an older woman from an insincere, self-serving and manipulative point of view. Film allows us to examine our insecurities from the point of view of the character, and we learn much about ourselves by the honesty. For example, what makes older Woody Allen movies charming is that they are filled with self-obsessed insecurity, but he always attacked his insecurities with honesty and humor, which yielded laughs and insight. This movie lacked the courage, conviction and humor to address the definition of aging femininity within the context of relationships. I think a wonderful movie could be constructed along those lines, and given the aging population base it could be a hit at the box office.",It's Complicated
188,miseenscene5,It's Simple . . . and fun.,7,21 February 2010,"""It's Complicated"" is the latest installment in Nancy Meyers' middle-aged romantic comedy genre. Previous entries include ""What Women Want,"" ""Something's Gotta Give,"" and ""The Holiday."" This time, a fabulously successful bakery/café owner named Jane (Meryl Streep) reunites with her ex-husband Jake (Alec Baldwin) at their son's college graduation. Ten years ago, Jake left Jane for his mistress, the cold and tight-bodied Agness (Lake Bell). Jake and Jane are on good terms, but only to a point — Jane has been seeing a therapist for eight years, and Jake, with one replacement child and Agness pressuring him to sire another, is beginning to anxiously question why he ever left Jane. I am too — who would leave Meryl Streep for *that*? At their New York City hotel before the graduation, Jane and Jake slip into more than half a dozen cocktails, and subsequently into bed. Actually, as for the latter part, perhaps ""slip"" isn't quite the right word. ""Tumble"" is more like it — although the sex itself is left out, the expressions on their faces after the fact say that it was rapturous and exhausting. Minutes later, Jane is hanging her head penitently over the toilet bowl, while Jake is beside himself. Apparently, she is better than the best he's ever had, and he's in no mood to admit the mistake and move on. Despite how hung over she is, Jane has to agree.Thus begins an affair which Jake describes as ""very French of us."" Meanwhile, Jane is planning add-ons to her house with the soft-spoken architect Adam (Steve Martin). Why she needs more space when her last daughter is leaving the nest isn't entirely clear. What is clear, however, is that she is utterly convinced of her plans, and that Adam is growing steadily more attracted to her, so I go along with it. As all of this continues, Jane's older daughter is preparing to get married to a very nice young man named Harley (John Krasinski), and Agness has Jake on a weekly schedule at the fertility clinic. There is a hilarious scene in which Jake skips one of his appointments to rendezvous with Jane at a hotel where, unfortunately, Harley and his fiancée are also meeting with a wedding planner in the lobby. The sequence in which Harley sees Jake enter the hotel, and then Jane — all the while trying to keep his fiancée distracted — is done with wonderful screwball timing.As the movie continues, so does this same screwball style. Sometimes it works very well, as when Jane and Adam get stoned at a party from an unexpectedly strong joint. Here Steve Martin the comedian is allowed to emerge, in a screenplay which otherwise only permits him to be perfectly gentle and bland. Other times, not so well, as when Jane and Adam are hooked up via video chat on their laptops, and Jake, oblivious, hops right in front of the screen wearing nothing but a grin.All along, however, there is a subtler undercurrent of comedy as Jane realizes that she is still capable of lust and childishness. Meryl Streep perfected the body language and facial expressions for this in ""Mamma Mia!,"" another movie in which a middle-aged woman's old flames are suddenly reignited. Streep can say more with facial expressions than almost any actor — my favorite in this movie, as in ""Mamma Mia!,"" is a sort of double-take without the head jerk. Her eyes pop out a bit, her lips purse slightly, and she seems surprised not so much by these men's advances as by the fact that she's actually falling for them.Of course, the screenplay could delve into the implications of this more deeply. Of course Jake and Jane's kids might not be so perfect; Agness might not be such a bitch, and her son not such a brat. But then we wouldn't be in a Nancy Meyers movie anymore, and we might have less fun. Yes, there are better films about middle-aged men and women coming of age (""The Savages"" comes to mind). But I didn't go looking for such a film in ""It's Complicated"" — I went for good escapist fare. This is not a movie to see for original plotting, profound character studies, or philosophical questions. I enjoyed it for the cast — Meryl Streep (enough said) and Alec Baldwin, especially, who is so endearingly like a little boy in his mischievous glee that at times I forgot about the whole infidelity thing. As an overall story, it doesn't hold together very well, but sustains itself on delightful moments. There is the moment when Jane bakes what are surely the most divine-looking chocolate croissants ever put on film. There is the moment when Jane and Jake sit down with their kids and some popcorn to watch ""The Graduate,"" and Jane shifts anxiously when the hotel clerk asks Benjamin, ""Are you here for an affair?"" And there is, of course, the moment in the hotel room when a doctor is tending to Jake after a mild cardiac episode, and Meryl Streep, unblinkingly, delivers one of the movie's most riotous lines. See it for yourself — you'll agree that it must rank at the top of the list of Meryl Streep lines you never expected to hear.",It's Complicated
189,majicou,Smart Comedy about Divorce and Dating Late in Life,10,29 December 2009,"Meryl Streep can do no wrong. She is by far the greatest American actress in my lifetime. This is an excellent and smart comedy about effects of divorce and dating late in life. Similar to 'Somethings Gotta to Give' but more thoughtful, younger and fresher. Meyers covers a lot of the unresolved emotions left behind after a divorce quite well and has made it heartfelt, funny and hilarious at times especially during scenes involving Krasinski. Shot beautifully in gorgeous Santa Barbara, Streep's character is played with depth for a woman her age being a divorced caring mother, struggling to come to terms with her feelings for her ex-husband while trying to move on with her life as a single woman and also balancing her needs over her children's. Baldwin is excellent as the regretful husband and you genuinely feel sorry for him. The children are portrayed well as also having been deeply affected by the situation. Martin on the other hand plays it straight but provides the balance for the drama and comedy in the movie. All in all it is a pleasant comedy both truly funny and smart; its worth the ticket price and a future DVD purchase.

It's a refreshing romcom that doesn't circulate around the typical confused 20-something woman. Instead Jane (Streep) is a strong, intelligent, self possessed woman with kids and a career. She's refreshing in her empowered approach and her ability to create a beautiful life, with or without a man. Nancy Meyers creates the most beautiful, immersive set, down to the last detail..

All the parts of the equation looked great to me: Meryl Streep, effortless and fabulous and now a box office queen and wrangler of light-hearted, comedic roles; Alec Baldwin, the gem of the brilliant ""30 Rock""; Steve Martin, always lovable and in need of a good move part; Nancy Meyers, a pioneer of older and sometimes divorce-centric romance (""Something's Gotta Give"", ""The Parent Trap""); and a unique story line, featuring an older woman in between her married ex and a new man.The movie was different than I expected, but I was certainly far from disappointed. I had heard the film was not laugh-out-loud funny; this is completely false. The entire theater laughed for a good eight minutes straight in a scene about three quarters of the way through featuring the three main characters and a joint (c'mon, who doesn't want to see the woman behind ""Doubt"" and ""Sophie's Choice"" completely stoned? She was great at it). John Krasinkski stole the movie, delivering his lines with the pace and talent of a very worthy contender for America's new favorite handsome goofball actor. His easy, hilarious banter with such Hollywood royalty was a blast to watch.I really liked that I felt sympathy for all of the characters involved in the love triangle, even the adulterous cad, Baldwin. The acting is flawless throughout, from Streep's post-coital hangover to her chemistry with both leading men.A few warnings: if you don't like Meryl Streep, don't see this. She's in almost every scene. This role was pretty much her role in ""Mamma Mia"" minus the singing and the Greek island. Also - and this might sound silly - but if adultery makes you uncomfortable, I wouldn't suggest it, because everyone in Streep's lonely but stable, post-divorced life encourages the affair, even her shrink. And the ending, while not easily predicted, was a little flat, the outcome not disappointing but poorly executed. I will gladly report, however, that there is a merciful shortage of the sex that was so prominent in ""Something's Gotta Give"" because the actual act is less important to the story line here. The bedroom scenes are sensitive, funny, and PG.Bottom line: It was funny, it was relevant to modern families and divorce-bred dilemmas, and, in the words of my friend as the credits began to roll, it pulled all the right heartstrings.",It's Complicated

And the rest of the movie just passed by like short parodies with ""commercial breaks"" as people staring each other with sparkling eyes. I stopped counting how many times i have seen these scenes in other movies. It just has no effect on me anymore. Even trying to guess what will happen next was of no fun! I even could not understand some reactions that the characters express, and i also felt that they did not know why they do it either. There were so unnecessary scenes, i thought the director had the idea that putting so many interesting scenes together will have an additive effect, and make a proper movie. Putting good pieces in it, does not make the whole seem more beautiful.This movie may mean something for a person who has same kind of divorce issues, who has not seen these kind of movies before, who wants to make sure that old people can have sex but haven't watched ""somethings gotta give"" yet, who has not been impressed by Streep's performance in ""julie/julia"" yet, who wants to see Steve Martin in a ""this movie could be done without my character"" type of role.

I understand it was done that way in order to avoid a corny, ""happy ending"" type ending, but the end didn't make sense. For one thing, the Streep character gave no indication that she would dump him in the end. The kids seemed to love him the whole movie, but inexplicably didn't want him back when he announced he wanted back. So it made no sense when he was rebuffed by all at the end, other than to prevent it from being a predictable happy ending type ending.Also, I couldn't stop thinking how that house that Streep lived in, in Santa Barbara with all that land and privacy,would cost millions. Apparently, Baldwin, who was a partner in a law firm, must have been very very successful to give her enough money for a place like that in their divorce settlement, and/or her pastry restaurant must have been extremely successful.But hey, its a movie and you're supposed to just enjoy it and not think about those things. Besides, if they were not attractive, wealthy people then it would have just felt like an episode of Jerry Springer. It seems like movies like this always have characters who are wealthy, attractive and drink a lot of booze without really getting drunk.

Her children were cloyingly mushy, Steve Martin needs to layoff the plastic surgery and Alec Baldwin was a possessive jerk. The only character I enjoyed was Harley the fiancé. Meryl plays the perfect woman who everybody adores with obviously more than 24 hours in her day. She tends to the most perfect vegetable garden, runs a wildly successful bakery, and lives in a beautiful home on a picturesque parcel in California that realistically would cost millions of dollars.

It has a rich family, despite no one actually working, with perfect children and forbidden love. I have watched the movie at a sneak preview and found myself irritated by several extremely cheesy scenes.There are only two scenes, which have funny elements, so it's not actually a comedy but a serious film trying to be realistic. The film unfortunately fails to be realistic ranging from inconsistencies in the global storyline down to the individual behaviour of most characters. Furthermore, the movie expects the audience to find amoral conduct acceptable, which includes destroying someone else's family partly motivated by jealousy.In general the movie may be insulting to those who were either born in a family destroyed by an unnecessary divorce or an affair, are not white, not beautiful, or are not rich despite actually working hard, being responsible and being considerate. The film may especially please those who think that by looking at a beautiful and rich family they somehow get to share their prosperity.Couples might feel highly discomforted by the movie's remarkably positive stance on cheating the partner and not even bothering about one's own children. I could well imagine that this movie sparkles arguments among couples that might even be consequential with these sensitive topics involved.I agree that the movie can be summarized as ""chick flick"".

205,daisy-tillman3,It's Complicated - No It's Simply Funny..See it!,8,27 December 2009,"Meryl Streep gives a Master's class in acting with her performance in this film. Ironically, the skillful way she can change her emotions on a dime, phasing in and out of blissful incredulity and simple despair can't be taught. In writer/director Nancy Meyer's latest Rom-com, Streep plays Jane, an empty nest divorcée who finds herself suddenly being re-wooed and won by her cheating, charismatic ex-husband, Jake (played cunningly by 30 Rock's Alec Baldwin).Jane is on the verge of a mid-life crisis - her kids are all grown up and she is facing a future of watching the Hills all alone in her spacious (gorgeous, scenic, straight-out-of-a-catalog) Santa Barbara home for the first time. Her friends tell her she needs to get back out there, but you can sense that she has already resigned herself to loneliness. Just then she has a casual meeting with her new architect, Adam (Steve Martin, in a subdued and heartfelt role), a soft-spoken gentleman whose own marital experiences had left him bruised and battered. His plans for her home are a metaphor - he seems instantly attuned to her needs and has no trouble complying with her demands (in the form of 47 emails), whereas her ex, when he sees the plans, immediately attempts to alter them -It's a short, but brilliantly insightful exchange.In New York celebrating their son's college graduation, Jane and Jake find themselves at the hotel bar each alone, as Jake's trophy wife has stayed home nursing his sick step-son. In a whirlwind of wine, reminiscing and dancing they find themselves in bed together, Jane confused and hungover, and Jake happy as a clam. It's here that Baldwin shines. He weaves a web of charm, regret and remorse that Jane is unable to untangle. After their second rendezvous, and an impromptu trip to her therapist for advice (a truly human scene from Streep), Jane decides to dive head first into a full-on affair.From there, the title of the film is fully realized. Jane is conflicted because she is rediscovering herself in the context of the affair, all the while she is commanding the attention and affection of Adam the architect. She knows he's battle-scarred and the details of his pain, but the history with Jake is pulling her focus. It all comes to a head, as expected, and everybody gets hurt. However, Meyer's constructs a conclusion that plays out for the best - and the lessons that Jane and Jake learn inform very grounded discussions, and equally human decisions.Over the last decade, Nancy Meyers has provided the American Rom-Com library with some aesthetically beautiful films -filled with scenic landscapes, lavish interiors, lyrical sophisticated jazz and rich performances from skilled actors in films such as ""The Holiday"", ""Something's Gotta Give and ""What Women Want.""

Such a great contrast to the angst ridden, me- me - me under 30 'women' prevalent in todays movies ( Julie in the Julia/Julie movie) I remember when lovers would walk through fire for each other. That is why I loved the Julia child part of the other movie. This movie carries this forward. Streep as Jane is strong and vulnerable. Who will she choose? Her 'changed' ex or her 'reliable' new guy....go see it!",It's Complicated

Also about time that ""mature"" women are portrayed as being sexy and have an advantage over the ""younger"" woman.Maybe married men will think twice before dumping their family for a fling with a young woman. I will buy this movie to see it again! Please think about a sequel. Movie left you wanting to know what happened.....and that is a sign of a good movie...It leaves you wanting more!!!! I really thought the choice of actors was excellent! I really liked the portrayal that even though people's bodies are not perfect they can still be sexy! Thank you for such an enjoyable movie!",It's Complicated
208,pickleb,"Wonderful Romantic Comedy, Best in Years",9,2 January 2010,"Almost a ten for me. 53 year old male who prefers romantic comedy to action-adventure. This film had a wit and a appreciate of today's woman that made the film very slice of life for me. Beautiful scenes, hilarious wit and almost slapstick. This film is not for the prudish but is by no means obscene. Just great adult fare and Meryl Streep can now do anything. This year she has been Julia Child, Mamma Mia and now the Other Woman. I'd want her back too. Bravo, Nancy, Bravo.I have never enjoyed Alec Baldwin, but he was light and funny in this film and the pairing really worked. Steve Martin's role was purposely a little flat but he did underplay things well.John Krasinski is a true scene-stealer. Like Streep, with just a knowing glance or a facial expression, he causes laughs and audiences will just enjoy him. Best romantic comedy since Something's Gotta Give. Baldwin is no Nicholson, but this was a better script and Streep has no match.",It's Complicated
209,dlaskowitz,Refreshing,6,13 January 2010,"I found It's Complicated to be a refreshing version of a romantic comedy. It was refreshing to see older actors in a genre that is usually portrayed by younger actors. It was nice to see fresh younger faces in this movie as opposed to the typical young actors that always appear in romantic comedies. It seemed to me that the cast as a whole had an amazing chemistry. This movie definitely had its comedic moments, but was also filled with more powerful messages as well. I saw this movie with my twelve year old cousin that did not appreciate the more serious moments as much as the rest of our family. I think that this movie was refreshing difference to the other movies that were released around the holiday time",It's Complicated
210,ladk,Best romantic comedy in years,10,13 January 2010,"It's Complicated is a very cute chick flick that was well developed and supported by an outstanding cast. Meryl Streep was at her best as Jane, a divorcée struggling to choose between two men. Her ex husband,played by Alec Baldwin, with whom she recently started having an affair with, and her architect, played by Steve Martin, another divorcée who she recently started dating. Steve Martin and Alec Baldwin have amazing performances as their characters fight for the love of Jane. Jane's three children and her daughter's fiancé are all excellent edition to this film making it more endearing and relate-able for younger audiences. Jane's daughter, Lauren's, fiancé Harley is a very lovable character who brings a lot of comedic relief to the movie. The plot was very good and well thought out, as was the overall production of the film. It's Complicated is a very touching film that will be enjoyed by women of all ages.",It's Complicated
211,miss-rz,Shallow and dirty!,1,12 February 2010,"Shallow and dirty! This movie is mostly about food, sex! And pot!! Since when is it OK to watch people smoking pot in a movie about family?! What is that telling the younger generations? That it's OK to smoke pot? I remember the days of (this is your brain on drugs') ads, the days of parents watching over their children so they don't do drugs, and now the parents are doing it?!!! Isn't it enough that Hollywood has been destroying the parents' image since the 90's? All movies suggest that parents don't know better than their children, that they make big mistakes and that their children always turn out to be right in the end and the parents turn out to be wrong! To top it all up, now Parents are even doing drugs! There go your role models!Is this movie about showing the emotions of a man who left his beautiful kids and regretted it? No, only one scene suggests that. The rest is about a man coming back to his first wife for more sex. Is it about the emotions of a betrayed wife? I don't think so, the main thing this wife talks about with her girlfriends before and after having the affair was sex: lack of it before and the satisfaction of it after! When I knew Meryl Streep was starring in this movie I thought I was in for a romantic and valuable movie.. What a disappointment!What happened to the good, clean and deep writers like the ones that created Mrs Doubtfire and step-mom... to name a couple?! Those movies still had great family values, deep emotions and thoughts. I hope that there still is in America honest and good parents who share my opinion and raise their voices against this kind of destructive movie.I think that just as it is the right of the ones behind the movie to give us their ideas and make us pay for them, it is our right to give them mine..

So I did the same yesterday. It said that the movie had a 6.8 . My girlfriend really wanted to see the movie so I decided to go. But what an awful movie... The story is so incredible weak and how everyone reacts at certain situations is unrealistic. Well now is my opinion maybe not really objective since I'm a male. I can understand how woman like the movie more than I did. But in this review I just wanted to say that for woman it is a nice movie to see but objectively speaking it is a bad movie.

213,buddhikamh,Familiar story with a simple flow,7,10 February 2010,"Well for a start this a familiar story to most movie lovers I guess. Divorced couple going through hard times in their new lives, coming together because of some family get together, refreshing their relationship and so on.. But should say its not anything boring, it has some real moments and good laughs.Well after years of separation of separation much have changed. Maybe after all they have changed into the people they always wanted each other to be ? (This too seem to be the point most similar story movies trying to capture as well) So its all about decisions, there are also other factors such as their children, new partners, careers etc.About the story of the movie I'm not going much into detail as it might ruin the movie for you. Well talking about the acting senior actors/actress do OK. Alec Baldwin & Steve Martin do a good job. But sometimes younger group seems to go over the top with over acting. Well maybe its not that bad, maybe its just me. Also when watching the movie all characters seems to be given with strict orders of what kind of stereotype he/she is. Especially the minor characters; for example take Harley - funny man in charge of comical department of the movie, Gabby – innocent/childish daughter, Adam - geeky architect , Agnes – evil woman (which is bit of a twist really, because after all she is the legal wife of the main character, who's having the affair with the 'good' woman).One reason I watched the movie was its said to be a good comedy, and happy to say it really is. Even with serious events, there are few laughs around. Sometimes its obvious that comical part is bit detached and added artificially to the story. But it really tickles, so Harley has done a good job.All in all as I said it's a familiar but interestingly done story, hilarious moments, good acting from the main lot. Even though the title says 'Its Complicated' movie it self is just an ordinary. ;) So in conclusion it's a good movie to watch.",It's Complicated
214,cinemafrank,It's Just Awful,1,2 June 2010,"I was completely dismayed by the storyline of this movie, but at least I thought it was written or produced by some overly-gross vain and insecure Hollywood male. To learn it was written by a woman! I almost puked!If disbelief, shock, and horror were the emotions you wanted to evoke from your audience, Nancy Meyers; then congratulations, you did your job brilliantly!The word on the page never skips far from its author, and I shudder to think people may actually think this way.This story lacks ethics, reason, the dream state, or a celebration of nature, to name but a few.Nature was actually portrayed as a plastic prop, and came across quite contrived, a second thought and stand in.Neither a comedy or tragedy, neither reality or a dream, the viewer failed to be surrounded by the mists of the dream state, those mists are what strike the viewer at the core, never really leaving them, even when the credits have rolled.The protagonists actions felt devised rather than natural, no real motive, each scene and its characters should have been naturally occurring by the cause and effect of events, but instead felt rather forced. Reason was left out, with nothing left to fill the vacuous space left behind (such as fantasy, or that dream state mentioned previously).Ethics, well, this was the elephant in the room. None of the characters in this movie made a strong case to either live with or without ethics, and as the plot revolves around affairs and cheating on your spouse, the choice to ignore it is most puzzling. This movie wasn't grey, or black and white. This movie wasn't sophisticated, charming, subtle, or endearing. This wasn't the worst movie, or best movie I've ever seen. It was an addition to the mediocre landfill of not even a could've been.",It's Complicated
215,mcrosby57,"Enjoyable, Watchable, Enjoyable",10,21 November 2010,"A baby boomer, myself, it's really nice to see more and more movies take heart and poke fun of more mature and real life situations, even examine the complicated issues of the beginning 21 Century with real, naturally aging actors and actresses. Alec Baldwin is fabulous and I love that his character examines himself and choices he made through life. Meryl Streep is.well, Meryl. She delves into her character managing the perfect facial expressions and gestures to give real life to the screen and thought into the character's emotions. Steve Martin plays the quintessential elder emotionally conservative, nerd: perfect. It's entertainment, it's a heartwarming predictable story, it's got some great lines, if you are over 45, you can relate to it. It's a wonderful afternoon or evening. Why do critics insist on justification for an enjoyable 2 hours? Just enjoy. Think about divorce, aging, children leaving the home, complex feelings and simple feelings, and the knowledge of 40+ years of experience in 2009-2010. This movie pokes fun at that and makes you smile. Just enjoy it.",It's Complicated

It was refreshing to see him playing a different character. He was kinda simple, but genuine!! He was the safe and cautious one. Alex Baldwin was over the top. He was so self absorbed and lonely-looking for love. When really he alread had it all. He couldn't see it. I also loved the cooking part. I am a 50 year old chef and my husband is a chef also.

I laughed and laughed; I cried a lil bit, but most of all I was simply constantly entertained in an excellent way. The movie was over so quickly!! Meryl Streep, Alec Baldwin and Steve Martin have all out-done themselves. They brought the characters to life, made them likable, quirky, endearing and appealing which made this a movie that you didn't want to see end.

218,neesta85,Junk food,6,23 May 2011,"Let me start this review by stating that I HATED ""Something's Gotta Give."" Had I known that ""It's Complicated"" was directed by the same woman, I might not have given it a chance.As it was, I waited for IC to come on HBO and was pleasantly surprised by Alec Baldwin's performance. I found him extremely sexy as well as hilarious. I am a big fan of Meryl Streep and enjoyed her performance in this film, but she was no Jake Adler! I thought Steve Martin's character would have been better played by a no-name actor, for the quality of the script and the amount of talent required. The adult children, like the evil stepson, were whiny and annoying. Jake's young wife was a one-dimensional shrew. The Harley character, however, was the most irritating of all. In all of his scenes, his presence seemed designed either to establish his unlikely closeness with his soon-to-be in-laws or to showcase his totally un-funny discomfort over knowing about The Affair. He adds nothing positive to the film. It feels like he was tacked on in hopes of making him a huge star.Why did I give it 6 stars if I hated it so much? Alec and Meryl were wonderful together. They really did sparkle. Alec had me at, ""You've gone native--I was into it."" Other reviewers complain about Meryl's ditziness and the fact that neither of them seemed to spend much time at their incredibly demanding jobs, and they're right, but who cares? It's a light, silly fantasy, nothing more. Had I paid to see it in the theater, I'd be annoyed.I'm 33, married, no direct experience with divorce. In case you're wondering.",It's Complicated

Meryl is good, obviously, even when speaking nonsense like: ""I love making lavender ice creams when I cannot sleep"" - but why her amazing talent and charm is being wasted in such a mediocrity?

How can you make a movie with Steve Martin in it and not let him be funny at least a little bit? Alec Baldwin's character is unlikable, while Streep doesn't even get close to her best acting at any point in the film. If I hadn't been stuck on a plane with nothing much better to do, I would have stopped watching. But there was also a certain morbid curiosity to discover whether it might possibly get better. It didn't. Here's to wishing these fine actors better roles in better movies in the future.",It's Complicated
221,JakeBarrett,A magnificent delight that keeps you hooked right from the beginning!,10,17 December 2013,"It's Complicated really is a fantastically delicious treat by the queen of Rom-Coms herself, Nancy Meyers. Nothing shouts 'romantic comedy' better than two middle aged people fooling around and enjoying themselves. After all, this is exactly what this film should be aboutromance and comedy. This is something that Nancy has never quite managed to reach in previous films such as 'Something's gotta give'. Nancy creates beautiful looking worlds that make you want to re- decorate your house, buy new lighting, wear new clothes and change your career to own a luxury bakery. Just watching this film and listening to even more of the audio wonders from Hans Zimmer keeps you hooked on this film and the light humour throughout keeps you smiling. Casting in this film is brilliantone of the best I have seen in fact and everyone fits the characters extremely well from bakery owner Jane (Streep), lawyer Jake (Baldwin) and newcomer to the family Harley (Krasinski) all the way through to surgeon Dr.Moss (Patrick) who I must say looks a little bit plastic himself. Meryl Streep has undoubtedly give one of her best performances in years showing that she can still show her sexier side at 60. She plays an every day lady that runs a beautiful bakery alongside her personal life of having a house extension, having her sons graduation, her daughters wedding and an ex husband that she still has feelings for. Streep soon gets caught up in the whirlwind of life when architect Adam begins to show his affectionate side towards her and that is where she has to make a decisionAdam or Jake. This is where things become 'complicated'.Baldwin plays a careless character who shows that he still knows how to have fun in his older days. As well as having a psycho controlling wife, a spoilt young son and a job that he never seems to go to, Jake decides to go with his gut and crawls into bed with his ex wife Jane. This is the start of an official affair and things slowly slide to the bottom when he leaves his wife for Janewho now has Adam who has just got divorced and fell in love with Jane See the problem here?Peace bearer Harley keeps the film entertaining and soon turns into one of the main characters after finding out everything thats happening between Jane and Adam, taking away some of the light from the older characters in the storyline. My only negative point about this film is the mannerisms of Jane's children who are now grown up and live away from home. They annoyingly interfere with Jane's private life and constantly ask questions when Jane runs outside to talk with Jakenot to mention crawling into bed together sobbing when they find out the divorce isn't completely over which happened 10 years previously. Overall the storyline is brilliant and one that many people can relate toproving that although things may become bad and life is a roller coaster of crazy eventseverything will work out correctly in the end. The use of very neutral colours brings this film down to earth and the small comedy moments throughout are written to perfection. This film really is an easy watch and although it is aimed at an older audience, it's one that the younger generation can still definitely enjoy (I'm 19). Meyers really should have received more credit for this film and I look forward to seeing if she is able to top this one in future films.",It's Complicated
222,mcginley-jacq,"A witty, yet romantic comedy",8,17 February 2014,"Divorce, kids' moving away, a remodel, a new man, and an affair⎯ life really is complicated. It's Complicated is a romantic comedy that exemplifies what can happen after years of marriage, a divorce, followed by an impulsive night together. The director, Nancy Meyers, has written an ingenious and witty script with ripened humor and sexual content that is intended for adults. But it is the vibrant performance and effortless chemistry between Alec Baldwin and Meryl Streep that motivates this film.Jane Adler (Streep) and Jake Adler (Baldwin) were married for 20 years and have three grown kids, but cheating caused their somewhat perfect marriage to come to a hasty halt. Now, 10 years later, Jake is married to his mistress (Lake Bell), and Jane is still single, unless you count her relationship with food. The two become reunited at their son's (Hunter Parrish) graduation and sparks between Jane and Jake ignite at a hotel bar. This is the beginning of their problematic affair. The dialogue and encounters between Baldwin and Streep make you actually think they were once lovers who still have yearning feelings towards each other. As their relationship unfolds, Baldwin and Streep's affair feels authentic, due to their on screen chemistry. By the first encounter, audiences can witness Jake's longing for Jane. Baldwin uses a sly smile and slight head turn to captivate Streep's attention. He also applies his lawyerly character to persuade Streep to stay in the wrongful affair. Streep uses shyness to her advantage in this role, to show how any woman would be reluctant to have an affair with their ex-husband. The affair causes tension between Jane and Jake, which is highlighted by Streep's subtle use of small nuances. Meryl Streep uses a realistic, yet awkward laugh when she is conflicted by her irrational affair with her ex-husband. Women everywhere, who have been in troublesome situations can relate to this laugh. Streep uses it when she is secretly with Baldwin to show that she is uncomfortable about the affair, when she has to lie to her children, when she divulges the affair to her best friends, and when she is starting to get close with Adam (Steven Martin), her architect; this laugh makes Jane feel real. Meryl Streep also uses a nuance of distraughtly tapping her chest when she is anxious. This tapping is seen when she is told that she needs an eyebrow lift where they will cut the skin off her forehead and staple it back on. This tap wasn't written into the script, but it was added by Streep to make Jane who she is.The complexity of the relationships and actors in this movie make it a satisfying romantic comedy. It's Complicated makes you want put yourself in Jane's shoes to see what you would do. Have an affair with your ex-husband who still loves you, but has a wife? Or start a relationship with your architect who is overly nice, but divorced?",It's Complicated

John Krasinski was probably the most entertaining. Nothing groundbreaking, but miles ahead of everyone else by comparison. This entire movie feels like some middle aged woman's wish fulfillment and therefore appeals to that audience exclusively. This absurdly rich older woman has to choose between two men who like her?
