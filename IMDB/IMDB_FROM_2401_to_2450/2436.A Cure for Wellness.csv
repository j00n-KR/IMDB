0,SnoopyStyle,intriguing moodiness,7,18 December 2017,"Lockhart (Dane DeHaan) is a corrupted young executive. The board is pushing for a merger and they send Lockhart to retrieve CEO Pembroke from a mysterious wellness center in remote Swiss Alps. Both the board and Lockhart agree to pin his indiscretion on Pembroke. Upon arriving, Lockhart senses some strangeness from Dr. Volmer (Jason Isaacs) and the various people. He gets into a car accident with a deer and wakes up with a cast on his leg being cared for in the wellness center. He is taken with strange beauty Hannah.I find the brooding moodiness intriguing. I love the body horror aspects. It could have stayed a simple horror which would be much better. It goes off into some slightly questionable directions. It should be much harder for Lockhart to leave the hospital. The tension would be higher if he's forced to stay. Trying to escape is a great way to raise the intensity. The movie plays with the reliability of Lockhart's perception but that could be sharper. DeHaan as a lead continues to struggle with a tinge of personal demon. Overall, I love the mood and the style but the story could be improved.",A Cure for Wellness
1,claudio_carvalho,Bizarre and Weird,7,11 June 2017,"In New York, a middle-aged executive of a financial company has a fatal heart attack while working after hours in the office. The board of directors indicates the young and ambitious executive Lockhart (Dane DeHaan) to assume his position and assigns Lokhart to bring the CEO Roland Pembroke (Harry Groener) back to the company to sign a merger. Further, the company is under investigation of the government and the directors intend to blame Pembroke for dirty business. Pembroke moved to an expensive spa in a castle located in a remote location in the Swiss Alps. Lockhart heads to the place by plane, train and a limousine driven by the local driver Enrico (Ivo Nandi). On the arrival at the spa, the attendant and the director Dr. Heinrich Volmer (Jason Isaacs) do not let Lockhart speak to Pembroke and ask him to return later. Enrico drives Lockhart back to the village but there is a car accident and he returns to the spa to recover a broken leg. Soon Lockhart meets and befriends the weird teenager Hannah (Mia Goth) that drinks a liquid from a blue bottle; and an old patient that tells how the castle was built on ruins of the castle of an evil baron that wanted to marry his sister to have a pure blood child two hundred years ago. When he discovers that his sister is infertile, he uses the local residents to find a cure for his sister that was killed by the dwellers. Lockhart suspects that Dr. Volmer is performing experiments with the interns and decides to investigate the clinic.""A Cure for Wellness"" is a bizarre and weird thriller in a nightmarish atmosphere with strange characters and a long and predictable storyline. The plot is a little confused but the cinematography and sets are wonderful and the performances are great. With a more concise screenplay and a better plot point, ""A Cure for Wellness"" could be a little masterpiece. But it is worthwhile watching this film. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""A Cura"" (""The Cure"")",A Cure for Wellness
2,nogodnomasters,Ambition is a sickness,6,6 July 2017,"Roman Pembroke (Harry Groener) has decided to leave the rat race. He is at a sanitarium/spa in Switzerland and has no intention of returning to New York to conclude a major merger. His signature is a must. Circumstances dictate Lockhart (Dane DeHaan) must go and persuade Pembroke to return. A freak accident forces Lockhart to become a patient at the same location.We know something odd is going on. We are told a story of an event that happened 200 years ago, one that changes slightly each time we hear it. We also know there is something in the water. We and Lockhart try to solve the puzzle.This is a science fiction film made needless long. It was oddly interesting and boring at the same time. It created a mystery, one we figure out before Lockhart. The clues come slowly and it felt like pulling teeth to get them. This is not a sci-fi horror for everyone.Guide: F-word.

3,kosmasp,Get well soon,8,15 July 2017,"I get that some people may be already full when it comes to mystery thrillers or are a bit more skeptical in regards to them. Still it would be unfair to this to just go ahead and hate it even before watching it. It has an old school feeling to it. There is a certain predictability to it, even without having seen the trailer.The acting is good and while you may have flashbacks to similar themed movies (I'm looking at you Shutter Island and yes it is a superior movie), it doesn't mean that this does not have a couple of punches left to deliver. And a few surprises to shake you up with. There are some scenes here that might be hard to swallow (no pun intended) and the tension is high enough for the whole thing to work. A good movie, if not perfect",A Cure for Wellness
4,Sleepin_Dragon,"Intense, unique film.",8,24 March 2019,"I've tried all day to think of a similar film, and I can't, so the first thing I must applaud about this, is the very original storyline, it really does stand out as its major positive.For me it's impressive on every level, the acting is first rate, Jason Isaacs shows just how diverse and strong an actor he really is.It has certainly given me a phobia of eels for the rest of my life, I thought they were used to great effect, some of the visuals were quite brilliant I thought.I loved the eerie feel throughout, even at the beginning you were given a false sense of everything being fine, but of course all is not well at the grand establishment.I get why some people couldn't get into it, it's a deep film, you need to concentrate, otherwise you will lose the thread.I really enjoyed it. 9/10",A Cure for Wellness
5,jboothmillard,A Cure for Wellness,6,4 March 2017,"I saw clips and trailers for this film about two months before its release, then it was reviewed on the programme Film 2017, it was definitely the sort of film I couldn't miss, directed by Gore Verbinski (Mousehunt, The Ring, Pirates of the Caribbean, The Lone Ranger). Basically in New York City, at a large financial services firm, a man named Morris (Craig Wroe) has died of a fatal heart attack, ambitious young executive Lockhart (Chronicle's Dane DeHaan) takes his place. Lockhart's superiors Hank Green (David Bishins), Hollis (Lisa Banes) and Wilson (Carl Lumbly) inform him that the company's CEO, Roland Pembroke (Harry Groener), has not returned from a trip to a ""wellness center"" somewhere in the Swiss Alps, and a note suggests he may have suffered a breakdown. Lockhart is sent to the remote spa to retrieve Pembroke, the company need him to sign for a merger with another company, in fact the firm is covering up unsightly business deals, several of the partners hope to pin the blame on Pembroke. Lockhart finds the idyllic but mysterious spa,he is met by some resistance by the staff when he wishes to talk to Pembroke, particularly by the director, Dr. Heinreich Volmer (Jason Isaacs). When leaving the wellness center, a deer runs out into the road and causes driver Enrico (Ivo Nandi) and Lockhart to crash, Lockhart wakes up in the spa with his leg in a cast, he is forced to stay at the spa until his broken leg is heeled. During his time at the spa, Lockhart meets a mysterious young girl named Hannah (Nymphomaniac: Vol. II's Mia Goth), she says that Volmer is claiming she is a ""special case"", like him she drinks a strange fluid kept in a cobalt bottle. Lockhart finds out from another patient, Victoria Watkins (Celia Imrie), that the spa is built on the ruins of a castle, that was burnt down 200 years ago. The baron that once owned the castle wanted an heir of pure blood, he married his sister, but finding out she was infertile he began performing hellish experiments on the peasants, they eventually rose up and burned down the castle, they captured the baron's wife and cut the baby from the womb, Watkins claims that despite it being thrown in water and being fragile, the baby survived. Lockhart has his suspicions about what is really going on at the spa, including the staff not contacting his firm about his accident, something that may be in the drinking water, and the ailments of the other guests, he discovers a transfusion wing. The spa is a front for macabre medical experiments, eels are being filtered through human bodies to produce the ""cure"" Volmer and Hannah are ingesting, it is also causing the strange behaviours of the guests as they drink the water. Lockhart is captured by Volmer, he is subjected to nightmarish treatments and torture that warp his mind like Pembroke, making him question whether he himself is sick or not. Lockhart writes a letter to his employer saying he intends to remain at the spa, but one night he has a moment of clarity, he cuts open his leg cast and finds that his leg is not broken at all, and he finds Pembroke is dead, he goes in search of Hannah. Around this time, Hannah has had her first period, meaning she is fertile, a party to celebrate is organised by Volmer, he leads Hannah into a secret room, built from the ruins of the castle, he intends to rape and impregnate her. Lockhart realises that Volmer is actually the centuries-old baron, and Hannah is his daughter, during the confrontation and fight, Volmer's face is revealed to be a mask that hides his hideously burnt baron face. Lockhart sets Volmer on fire, the heated sparks blow through the ventilation and cause the whole castle and spa to burn down, Volmer overpowers Lockhart and is about to feed him to the carnivorous eels, but Hannah kills him, lodging a shovel into his head, he falls into the pit and is devoured by the eels. Hannah and Lockhart escape the castle on a bicycle as the whole place burns to the ground, on the way however Lockhart's employers from New York arrive in car to retrieve him and Pembroke, he is ordered to get in the car, they want to pin all corporate wrongdoings on him, but Lockhart chooses to run away with Hannah. Also starring Adrian Schiller as Deputy Director, Magnus Krepper as Pieter the Vet and Susanne Wuest as Volmer Institute Staff. DeHaan gives a good icy lead performance, as the film goes on you really question whether he is sick or going mad, Goth is wonderfully strange but fascinating, and Isaacs is almost pantomime but a reasonable villain. It is not the most original story, you could argue similarities to Shutter Island, but the style of the film, with its supernatural fantasy elements and dark nightmarish atmosphere throughout, feels like a classic Hammer Horror, the most disturbing visuals are the first eels in the large immersion tank, and the nasty gory dental torture scene, it may be a little long and uncertain in its direction at times, but it is very likely to become a cult classic, a worthwhile psychological horror thriller. Good!",A Cure for Wellness
6,Quinoa1984,"the script is all over place, and the visual creation of this world is unique. it's all mixed up",5,17 February 2017,"Gore Verbinski has a terrific visual sense and yet he is always susceptible to losing track of the script and storytelling. This was evident to an extent with the 'Pirates' sequels, and it's here as well. A Cure for Wellness is filled with a weirdness in its approach to this castle-hospital that makes it like Dracula crossed with Shutter Island (to an extent). It's a filmmaker so in love with his Gothic sensibilities, even down to having an actress in Mia Goth who seems plucked out of Central Tim Burton Casting. But as you're watching it and especially after it ends, a lot of the essential things in this story and the plot make no sense. Some of this is spoilery, and some of it is not.Dane Dehaan is working for some nondescript firm who, in place of serving jail time for some scheming with an account, has to go to this Sanitorium in Germany or some such place in the mountains (like Dracula, there's a castle on the hill with the townspeople down below who are distrusting of the castle people and doctors), and he's there to simply bring another wall st businessman home with him. However this is easier said than done as this young man gets into a car accident, breaks his leg, and while he's healing he is privvy to the rest of the sanitorium... which turns out to have many, many dark secrets. Perhaps too many.This is Verbinski indulging in his love for the deranged sights of doctors in coats doing creepy s*** to people with things like eels and the patterns of people doing things in repetition. He has a massive talent (Rango is among the great animated films of the past 20 years), but his talent overwhelms his better judgment. The script by Justin Haythe (from a story by him and Verbinski) explains some things so slightly that we're supposed to understand what's what, but the logic doesn't add up, and the movie is too long to have so many logic gaps.Chief among them, for example, is how this hospital works itself: old rich people go to this hospital in the mountains to get well. Okay, fair enough... but then they never leave and eventually these eels (okay, spoiler) sap out their life essence so that it can be bottled up (reminded me of a story element of Dark Crystal, only here they somehow manage to make it crazier, but OK, maybe). But this isn't a period piece, despite the origins of this castle and this 'Baron' as well as the doctor (Jason Isaacs) who may also be this Baron as aged 200/300 years without any slip-up. This isn't a period piece where suspension could be disbelieved; it's 2017, and people who go off to such a place, even if they're reviled by people who love them or are close to them, might, I don't know, be declared missing? What about their estates? They never come back - the eels make these rich people old-people compost - but then how does this hospital get better business? What does the Yelp review look like for this hospital? It isn't until Dane Dehaan goes to search for Pembroke that someone from the outside world is going to this place, or at least that's what we're lead to think. Wouldn't this story perhaps gain in some intensity if, I dunno, a few other people were there who came to get relatives and never came back? Again, this is clearly an homage to Dracula, but it's done in such a way where it becomes convoluted - I haven't even gotten to how Hannah (Goth) figures into all of this, and how her aging works and her backstory is even more complex, needlessly so - and it ultimately makes the story too little while also being stretched out to an interminable length (there's also one final bit near the end, involving the Wall st bankers, that was laughable and inane, a pure 'loose end' tie-up). The fact that Verbinski got over 100 million for this reportedly and had (what I presume was) final cut is impressive. He took a chance on something original in an age of properties and sequels-reboots-et-al, but it nevertheless doesn't make it immune to criticism of its created mythology a mess, or how long the mystery and intrigue mount for Lockhart when it could have been condensed; by the time he discovers the *real* dirty secrets of this place, the film is at the two-hour mark. It's a shame, since A Cure for Wellness is spectacular looking, but a shame nonetheless.",A Cure for Wellness
7,Hey_Sweden,"""Actually...I'm feeling much better.""",7,8 October 2019,"Dane DeHaan plays a young man named Lockhart, tasked with finding his company's CEO (Harry Groener) and bringing him back to NYC. The CEO has been spending time at a luxurious health spa in the Swiss mountains, run by a seemingly benevolent doctor named Volmer (Jason Isaacs). But since Isaacs, a veteran of bad guy roles, is playing the role, we all know better. Lockhart ends up confined to the spa himself after an accident, and keeps experiencing bizarre and ugly things - all on the way to figuring out the big secret behind Volmer, the delicate young ""special case"" patient Hannah (Mia Goth), and the spa itself.Many viewers may rightly figure out where this is going ahead of time, but that doesn't mean that this isn't a fairly interesting journey anyway. The script (by Justin Haythe, based on a story by him and director Gore Verbinski) is often questionable; to start with, the spa can't be that determined to hide its agenda if Lockhart is always walking around unsupervised despite his tendency to be inquisitive and disruptive.But the atmosphere is solid, in any event. Filmed on location in Europe, the whole film just emits an ominous quality right from the beginning. It's noteworthy for sumptuous visuals - Eve Stewart was the production designer, Bojan Bazelli the cinematographer - and a frequent use of disturbing moments as well. ""A Cure for Wellness"" can certainly boast one of the most unnerving scenes of dental trauma since ""Marathon Man"" 40 years previous. And leeches (albeit CGI leeches) play no small part in the overall look of the film.DeHaan is okay in the lead, starting off the story as a cold, smarmy jerk at first and becoming more engaging as he deals with more primal fears. Isaacs is great fun to watch as usual, and Goth has an ethereal appeal. The solid supporting cast includes Celia Imrie as puzzle and conspiracy loving Mrs. Watkins, as well as Ivo Nandi, Adrian Schiller, Tomas Norstrom, Magnus Krepper, David Bishins, Lisa Banes, and Carl Lumbly.All in all, this *does* take an awfully long time to get to where it's going, but if you're anything like this viewer, you won't mind that much.Seven out of 10.",A Cure for Wellness

9,zardoz-13,Haunting and Unforgettable!!!,9,28 July 2017,"If you're searching for a subtle, surrealistic, psychological thriller to creep you out, you won't do better than ""Ring"" director Gore Verbinski's ""A Cure for Wellness,"" with Dane DeHaan, Jason Isaacs, Mia Goth, and Harry Groener. Nothing about this portentous, atmosphere-laden chiller will induce nightmares, but goose bumps will come and go while you watch this byzantine, 146-minute, contemporary Gothic saga that boasts lenser Bojan Bazelli's ominous cinematography, Eve Stewart's imaginative production designs, and composer Benjamin Wallfisch's haunting orchestral score. Well, some things could give you more than goose bumps depending on how impressionable you may be. Verbinski relies neither on crude jump scares nor an obstreperous orchestral score to foster your fears. For example, a man attached to an oxygen tube, like a deep-sea diver, levitates in a gigantic water tank swarming with eels. Later, he learns he was alone in the tank, and the eels were part of his hallucinations. A demented dentist bores a hole into the same man's front tooth for no other reason than to torture him. Later, a mad scientist ignites into a blazing torch and our hero tangles with him. ""Lone Ranger"" scenarist Justin Haythe must have been channeling not only Hammer horror movies, but also Rod Serling's ""Twilight Zone."" The basic plot isn't complicated, but the circumstances surrounding it are heavily symbolic. A major New York City financial services firm embarks a white-collar employee, an unscrupulous stockbroker names Lockhart (Dane DeHaan of ""Chronicle""), on a flight to the Swiss Alps to bring back their CEO, Roland Pembroke (Harry Groener of ""Road to Perdition"") who has checked himself into an eerie sanitarium. The firm is about to merge with another firm, and Pembroke's signature is required before the deal can be sealed. No sooner has Lockhart arrived at this sanitarium than he finds himself in trouble himself. After he discovers that he cannot return to New York with Pembroke on the same day, he takes a car down the hill to the village to inform his superiors. During the descent on a winding mountain road, Lockhart's driver suddenly collides with a deer. The automobile that Lockhart is riding in plunges into the woods. If you hate to watch animals suffer, though they are rendered realistically in sophisticated CGI, you may take issue with the depiction. Later, when an injured cow is gutted, and eels and an embryo spill out of its belly. Lockhart awakens three days afterward in the sanitarium with his right leg encased in a plaster cast. Now, the patients are draw to this place because of its water. Nevertheless, something sinister lurks in the H2O. The enigmatic sanitarium doctor, Dr. Heinreich Volmer (Jason Isaacs of ""The Patriot""), believes in purging the toxins from his patients' bodies. As it turns out, there is more to Dr. Volmer than is readily apparent until far later into the action. Eventually, Lockhart encounters a strange girl, Hannah (Mia Goth of ""The Survivalist""), who has been kept behind the walls of the sanitarium because she is ""a special case."" Things get incredibly convoluted toward the end of ""A Cure for Wellness,"" and the board members who dispatched Lockhart show up themselves to find out what has happened to Lockhart. Dr. Volmer lied to Lockhart about contacting his firm about his accident. Verbinski shoots ""A Cure for Wellness"" as if he were Stanley Kubrick, and sometimes the setting evokes our anxieties. Since this movie runs over two hours and both the writer and director were responsible for the abysmal Disney western ""The Lone Ranger,"" critics eviscerated it with savage glee.",A Cure for Wellness

However, things don't go smoothly at all and Lockhart suspects that something sinister may be afoot.Intriguing thriller, directed by Gore Verbinski (Pirates of the Caribbean, Rango, The Lone Ranger). Plot develops slowly, giving information away in small instalments - just enough to keep you engrossed and not enough to give the ending away too soon. Maybe a bit too slow at times, but it the feeling doesn't tend to last for too long.Clever plot, well executed by Verbinski. In the end you are left with a few unanswered questions, but that might be the idea - it would be too easy if everything was neatly and completely explained. Also, no harm in filling in the details yourself.Verbinski builds the tension well, without having to resort to too many thriller clichés.

There's more than a little bit of THE DEVILS from Ken Russell here, as well. Throw in some tanks full of nude people from LOGAN'S RUN, a bunch of Richbich naked witches out of Roman Polanski's Macbeth, and the sort of rampant incest poking up in Vampire flicks everywhere, and what's not to like? With a plot as convoluted as one of Dan Brown's Da VINCI CODE-style labyrinths, Verbinski steams through a least a half dozen seeming end points, meaning that WELLNESS is NOT for those with either weak stomachs OR weak bladders, but it should be fine for Millennials.",A Cure for Wellness

Filmmaker Gore Verbinski - who co-scripted the story with Justin Haythe - delivers the creepy goods in this absorbing mystery sci-fi thriller with corporate climbing jerk Dehaan enlisted via blackmail by his higher-up superiors to locate and return a senior member of their company from an elite European spa that he has taken to with no intention to ever return. Well-crafted with echoes of Kubrick's ""The Shining"" and Scorsese's ""Shutter Island"" (it helps on the latter with DeHaan's eerie resemblance to Leonardo DiCaprio) the goings-on at a spooky sanitarium also has trappings of Val Lewton and Hammer Films ; to wit: Isaac's cool-as-a-cumber institute director and chief physician channels Peter Cushing cunning and Christopher Lee dread symbiotically so. Chilly cinematography by Bojan Bazelli only underscores the ghastly pallor of the inhabitants (and yes the pasty DeHaan and newcomer waif-like Goth - nearly a cruel in-joke on the surname!) with a taut score by Benjamin Wallisch and impeccable production design by Eve Stewart makes up for the at times tedious running time (easily 20 minutes could've been shaved).

13,neil-476,Too muddled to work properly,7,15 May 2018,"Young hotshot Lockhart (Dane DeHaan) is sent to retrieve a missing executive from an Alpine spa clinic, but he encounters a mystery in which patients seem to be treated in a very un-patiently manner. Lockhart starts throwing his weight around on arrival, but finds this gets him nowhere with creepy clinic boss Volmer (Jason Isaacs). And after waifish inmate Hannah (Mia Goth) tells him that no-one ever leaves, he is dismayed after a car crash turns him into a broken-legged resident.Over the next 2 hours (the film runs for 146 minutes), Lockhart prowls around the corridors of the clinic - insofar as you can prowl when you're on crutches - trying to figure out what's going on, something he is doing for us the audience, as well as himself.Quite frankly, I'm not sure what he found. Eels have something to do with it, bodies which look dead but apparently aren't, something in the water (it is a spa clinic, after all), and what is going on between Volmer and Mia? Ah, that. And, it would appear, something else, too.This film has production value plastered across every frame. It looks great. And it is very unsettling. Unfortunately, somewhere along the way, the narrative got loose and decided to take a short vacation, which left Lockhart creeping about discovering things which didn't make a huge amount of sense without further explanation which didn't always come.There is a resolution and then an ending. The ending is absolutely fine. The resolution leaves you going, ""Whut? Really?"" It's not a very good payback for all that creeping around.I must record a positive vote, though, for the moment where the child-like, anorexic-looking Hannah proves to have a pleasingly plump pair of invitingly squishy breasts under her Alice In Wonderland dress. These, in and of themselves, however, are not a sufficiently strong recommendation for two-and-a-half hours of this muddled mess.",A Cure for Wellness
14,AlsExGal,"Glossy, original psychological thriller...",7,15 February 2021,"...with elements of mystery and Gothic horror, from Fox and co-writer and director Gore Verbinski. Dane DeHaan stars as a cutthroat financial agent in a big Wall Street firm who is tasked with traveling to Switzerland to find the firm's CEO who has checked into an exclusive health resort. Upon arrival, it doesn't take long for DeHaan to realize something is not quite right at the seemingly idyllic sanitarium, which is on the grounds of an old castle in the Swiss Alps. But try as he might, DeHaan doesn't seem able to leave the place, and the hospital's chief doctor (Jason Isaacs) doesn't seem in a rush to allow that, either.This movie looks amazing, with evocative cinematography and terrific locations and sets. The acting is also good, and the cast of mainly lesser-knowns helps the characters to stand out. With a story like this, you know the outcome will be one of two things: either the protagonist is hallucinating/dreaming many of the events, or the events that he's experiencing are real and the story moves into Weirdsville. I won't spoil which it is here, but I will say it kept me guessing up to the end, and perhaps beyond. A warning: there is quite a bit of disturbing imagery, and you'll see a whole lot of people naked that you would rather not have seen.",A Cure for Wellness
15,gridoon2021,Gonzo gothic thriller,7,11 November 2018,"Personally I like films that take chances and dare to be different, and ""A Cure For Wellness"" is one of those films.

16,ferguson-6,Love that dirty water,6,7 February 2017,"Greetings again from the darkness. It might seem peculiar for the director of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, The Lone Ranger, and the Oscar winning animated Rango to be the driving force behind an atmospheric Gothic mystery-thriller, but Gore Verbinski seems to ignore any attempt to generalize or label his films. In fact, this latest film (written with Justin Haythe) attempts to challenge genre conventions by cloaking us in familiar themes and expecting us to be surprised by the late twist.Dane DeHaan has established himself as an actor with no boundaries. He has played characters as diverse as James Dean in LIFE, and Cricket in LAWLESS. This time he dons a business suit as Lockhart, an ambitious, young, morally flexible, workaholic financial hotshot. By bending a few FCC regs, Lockhart has maneuvered himself into a plush corner office on Wall Street, and is now strong-armed by senior management into taking on the less-than-appealing task of traveling to a ""wellness spa"" in Switzerland in order to bring back the CEO whose signature is necessary to complete a lucrative merger.The cinematography of Bojan Bazelli is gorgeous throughout, and it's literally breathtaking as we view the Manhattan cityscape, and then follow Lockhart's train streaming through the Swiss Alps mountains and tunnels. These are the ""wow"" shots, but the camera finds beauty even once the story takes us inside the sanitarium with the dark history  and confounding present. The building's history seems somewhat sinister, but its current day secrets are every bit as creepy. What exactly is the sickness that ""the cure"" is treating? Why does no one ever leave? What's with the eels? What's with the water? Why are teeth falling out? Why are the townfolks so off-put by those on the hill? What answers do the puzzles bring? SHUTTER ISLAND offers the most obvious comparison with its similar tone and atmosphere, but others that come to mind include THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU, ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST, and especially, Hitchock's REBECCA. Verbinski makes marvelous use of sound throughout – whether it's Lockhart's creaking crutches, the squeak of doors, the drip of ever-present water, or the metallic whir of machines. The look, sound, and feel create the tension necessary to prevent viewers from ever really relaxing, even if we wish the movie wasn't so darn long.Filmed at Castle Hohenzollern in Germany, it's a perfect example of how on filming on location adds an element that no soundstage can hope to achieve. Support work comes from some familiar faces like Jason Isaacs as Dr. Volmer, Celia Imrie, Carl Lumbly, Ivo Nandi, Harry Groener, and Adrian Schiller. However, it's Mia Goth (Everest, 2015) who has the biggest impact on screen outside of DeHaan. Her unusual look and slightly-off mannerisms are perfect for the role of Hannah, who is so crucial to the twist.Spanning two-and-a-half hours, the film abruptly flies off the rails in the final 15 minutes. It acts as a release for the stress it has caused, and as a reminder that director Verbinski likes to have fun with his films. It's quite possible that the film will struggle initially to find an audience, but later find success as a cult favorite and/or midnight movie. Whether you deem it silly or creepy, love it or hate it, you'll likely appreciate the look of the film and the creative surge of Verbinski.

17,morrison-dylan-fan,"""Do you know what the cure for the human condition is? Disease. Because that's the only way one could hope for a cure.""",10,2 October 2021,"Having heard for years about how this is one of the most strange films to come from a mainstream studio (Fox) , this is a title I've been meaning to see. Deciding to see the last ever movie released by Fox before the Disney sale was completed, the fittingly also weird Horror title The Empty Man, (2020-also reviewed) which led to me deciding to finally play the cure.View on the film:Travelling to a ""wellness center"" in the Swiss Alps with the single-minded goal of dragging CEO Roland Pembroke back to his financial services firm in New York, Dane DeHaan gives a fantastic performance as Lockhart, whose confident, straight-lace outlook is chipped away by DeHaan in a subtle change of Lockhart's facial expression, which gets drained of colour and covered with his brittle horror and doubt as Lockhart sinks deeper into the wellness treatment.Labelled a ""Special case"" at the center, Mia Goth gives a startling hazy performance as Hannah, whose initial timidness is used by Goth to heighten Lockhart's blurring lines of reality, until Goth has Hannah gliding pass the entrance gates with Lockhart, and bring into focus the mirage which the wellness has been built on.Greeting everyone who enters with a ""Hello"", Jason Isaacs displays a great level of care in walking the line of ambiguity as the good passive-aggressive off the cuff remarks towards Lockhart, and a firm, but emphatic hand,which he offers as Lockhart gets down with the sickness.Originally playing in a Punk Rock band, co-writer (with Justin Haythe) / director Gore Verbinski changes notes with The Sorcerer's Apprentice (2010-also reviewed) cinematographer Bojan Bazelli to unleash an immerse Prog-Rock mood over a grand two and a half hour canvas.Reflecting that not all can be as it appears with a mirror train shot in the opening moments, Verbinski seamlessly blends practical effects and CGI to give the ""wellness center"" an incredibly textured appearance, with long-ultra stylised tracking shots pulling Lockhart down the lime green coloured corridors of the center, cracking open a rich dream-logic ambient Horror atmosphere, where each grotesque Body-Horror discovery Lockhart makes from opening a new door, makes him question the pristine wellness image being reflected by the centre.Washing over the viewer long mood passages with a fantastic minimalist sound of the creek from Lockhart's crutches and the fantastic eerie crystal glasses score from IT (2017-also reviewed) composer Benjamin Wallfisch, Verbinski slides Lockhart and the audience deeper into the wellness abyss with electric push-in set-pieces on eels lighting up to unveil the treatment being performed, and a gloriously fiery Gothic Horror final in the crypt of the center.Going to the castle-like wellness center high in the mountains, the screenplay by Haythe and Gore Verbinski inventively take elements of Dracula, (Lockhart finding clues in newspaper clippings/ lettering's pieced together to solve puzzles, a power imbalance between the wellness center and the poor, fearful locals,and water being a stand-in for blood) and crosses them with an unsettling draining by eels away of all the ills of the world infecting Lockhart, leading to a re-birth with a new selflessness outlook,as Lockhart discovers a cure for wellness.",A Cure for Wellness
18,FlashCallahan,Why would anyone want to leave?...,7,26 February 2017,"Lockhart is an ambitious young executive who is sent to return his company's CEO from an idyllic Spa for the upper class in the Swiss Alps. Soon, he suspects that the spa's treatments are not what they seem. When he begins to discover its secrets, his sanity is tested, as he finds himself diagnosed with the same illness that keeps all the guests here wanting to stay for that little bit longer..Verbinski Has a wonderful eye when it comes to sets. As bad as the POTC films are, one cannot deny how awe-inspiring the sets can look, and his remake of The Ring had a suitable menace of it.Although he has been of his game for a few years, he seems to be back on track with this, which has more similarities to his 'Mousehunt', than any of his other works.But this is the type of film that will divide audiences right down the middle. It's not a horror per se, although it does have some sinister elements throughout that do disgust, both visually and aurally.Dehaan is well suited to the role, not just because he has a cold persona about him, the actor looks genuinely ill in all the films I've seen him. Here he is the atypical person who may or may not be delusional. The narrative is telling you one thing, his body language and gait is telling you another.The thing is with the film is that red herrings are thrown to you via the script. In one instance, Isaacs Volmer (whom is the sole reason to see this), explains that the treatment can trigger visions, and noises, so this could throw the narrative either way. Is he really seeing what he is seeing? Or is he slowly losing his mind due to the toxins leaving his body?It looks beautiful, The Spa is very reminiscent of The Overlook Hotel, with it's isolating environment, despite it being well accommodated.The film is way too long, a decent thirty minutes could have been done without, especially the first fifteen minutes, and whilst I was watching it, I could not help but think about other films.If you see this, I defy you not to think of the following films, Marathon Man, The Shining, The Woman In Black, One Flew Over..., Shutter Island, and oddly enough, POTC: Dead Man's Chest.But it's worth going to see it at the cinema, it's an oddly relaxing experience with some great performances, and some spectacular camera-work.Hello To Jason Issacs...",A Cure for Wellness

Overly too long,6,17 June 2017,"In this movie about a deranged doctor performing experiments in the name of blood purity, set very modernly in Switzerland, we get an unlikable hero getting caught in a web of madness from which there is no escape. And while the sets are great and the acting is OK, there is little else to be said about this two hours and a half long film.Think Wicker Man, but closer to the Nicholas Cage remake. There is a scene that I felt was a nod to ""not the bees!"". I mean, if poor DeHaan had a way of saying anything in it, he would have probably gone for ""not the eels!"".You have seen some incarnation of this story before: normal person that you can identify with goes into a place that is remote, completely isolated from the rest of the world, in which things happen that make one question their sanity; frustrated at every turn, the hero suffers with the audience until a resolution comes, bad or good. However in A Cure for Wellness the setup feel artificial, the motivations weak, the very possibility of the premise very remote.Bottom line: a very nice looking nondescript dream like medical clinic horror, doing nothing but wasting a lot of time.",A Cure for Wellness
20,Hellmant,The type of genre flick that I really like!,9,28 July 2017,"'A CURE FOR WELLNESS': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A psychological horror flick, about an American business executive that's sent to a mysterious wellness center, in the Swiss Alps, to retrieve his boss. The film was directed by Gore Verbinski (who's most famous for helming the first three 'PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN' movies), and it was written by Verbinski and Justin Haythe (who also co-wrote 2013's 'THE LONE RANGER' reboot, which was also directed by Verbinski). It stars Dane DeHaan, Jason Isaacs and Mia Goth. The film has received mixed reviews from critics, and it was also a bomb at the Box Office. I enjoyed it quite a bit though.A powerful financial firm, in New York City, is in trouble for criminal misconduct. The majority of the board members hope to blame the crimes on their CEO, Roland Pembroke (Harry Groener); who vanished at a wellness center, in the Swiss Alps, and is believed to have lost his mind. The powerful firm partners decide to send a new ambitious company executive, named Lockhart (DeHaan), to get Pembroke. Once Lockhart arrives at the very bizarre rehabilitation center though, he learns that the doctors there don't want to let Pembroke leave. After Lockhart is involved in a horrible car crash, involving a deer, he finds himself trapped at the wellness center as well. He also soon finds himself involved in some very strange (and nightmarish) experiments.The movie is almost two and a half hours long, but it never felt slow-paced or dragged out to me. I was always involved in what was going on on-screen, and consistently fascinated by the premise. I'm not a huge fan of Dane DeHaan, or Mia Goth for that matter, but they're both consistently cast in interesting (and usually well made) movies. I also love creepy horror flicks, and this is definitely a memorable one (it's very creepy and quite disturbing at times). It's the type of genre flick that I really like, and enjoy, and I don't mind long movies either (if they're paced well), but I can also see why a lot of viewers wouldn't enjoy this movie very much too. For me it's definitely a good one though.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/Mg3uG2FLNSE",A Cure for Wellness

22,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"A muddled, confusing and mostly unengaging ride",4,17 October 2017,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Cocky junior employee Lockhart (Dane DaHann) is rumbled trying to embezzle money from the top boardroom executives of the company he works for. In order to save himself from exposure and an undoubted prison sentence, he agrees to their demands and travels to a remote spa in the Swiss Alps to try and track down the CEO of the company who appears to have lost his mind. During his investigation, he encounters the enigmatic Dr. Volmer (Jason Isaacs), who appears to be conducting a series of experiments on a group of subjects. Before long, Lockhart finds himself in a desperate battle of survival against the nefarious goings on at the remote location.In this cinematic day and age, we're living in a time where the more outlandish and far fetched something is, the more it seems to be embraced and develops a cult status. Films along these lines are accepted into the mainstream much more readily now, and one such example would be this foray into the weird from Pirates of the Caribbean director Gore Verbinski. It's much darker material and operates on much broader boundaries than the family friendly POTC stuff, but it's still a big bundled, misguided effort that requires a lot of sticking power.Verbinski uses the Swiss backdrop to great effect, creating an uneasy sense of agoraphobia with the shots of the swirling castle walls and all the surroundings, achieving an impressively Gothic look. Visually, it's all very well done, but the mystery of the missing exec and the reasons behind his disappearance are never compelling or stirring enough to keep your attention and, even if they were, at nearly two and a half hours, the film is just way overlong and over-ambitious, trying to cram too much in and being even more disconcerting as a result. Cast wise, Isaacs has presence as the grimly mysterious doctor, but the rest are pretty disposable in disposable roles.There are undoubtable echoes of Shutter Island in the proceedings, a film that managed to maintain a far more unsettling sense of creepiness and isolation. Midway through, it curtails straight from psychological thriller to horror, showing its true colours as a film but managing not a jot more of an effect. **",A Cure for Wellness

Instead, we get a form of Gothic horror movie that borrows heavily from just about every predecessor: I detected borrowings from 'The Shining', 'An American Werewolf in London', 'Dracula', 'Marathon Man', 'The Picture of Dorian Grey', and 'Don't Look Now', among others. Needless to say, the whole does hang together particularly coherently, and it lacks the humour of director Gore Verbinski's earlier pirate movies. Instead, we have business executives who send their colleagues on errands under threat of prison rape. The idea of a movie set in a claustrophobic sanitorium is a good idea, albeit not a particularly fresh one, but this is an almost ludicrous delivery of that idea.",A Cure for Wellness

It also isn't as creepy as it thinks it is, despite a decently eerie tone for much of the run-time. Though it isn't ever boring, I was never exactly pining to uncover the mystery at the heart of the feature. The finale also becomes incredibly silly, seemingly betraying the tone portrayed up until that point. I generally enjoyed the flick, though, even if it never really grabbed me. It just doesn't seem to know what it wants to be, especially as it moves into its final third, and takes a long time to get to a disappointing conclusion. 6/10",A Cure for Wellness

The biggest problem is that the lead character keeps traversing through the halls of the hospital and that is supposed to be the thrilling part.

So the plot of the film is this guy from New York, Lockhart, is sent to a ""hospital"" to find a member of the team, Pembroke whom went there on a 2 week spa visit and never returned. Lockhart arrives at the institute and immediately picks up a disturbing vibe. He talks to Pembroke whom seems willing to come with him, then Pembroke disappears and the head doctor, Volmer, seems to be hiding him. Lockhart soon sees disturbing behavior, people loosing lots of teeth, dreaming about giant leeches, and even people encased in a vault of water.The workers there try to convince him he's a patient but with the help of an old tale about a baron whom tried to have a child with his sister 200 years old and fetus being torn from her but surviving, he puts the clues together.

It looked like a bizarre arthouse film and not something that would appeal to me. Circumstances played out in such a way that I was presented with it and decided to give it a go and *Drumroll* I was pretty much right.Starring Dane DeHaan, Jason Isaacs and Mia Goth it's a very difficult movie to categorize as its a bit of a genre breaker.It tells the story of a young businessman who is forced to travel half way across the world to convince a colleague to return home from a mental asylum. Upon arrival it quickly becomes apparent that things aren't as they seem.It's moody, it's atmospheric, it's genuinely interesting and at 2 and a half hours its quite the epic.It however does not make for the easiest of viewing, in fact it's kind of gross. The plot drifts off in various directions but to its credit does culminate in something fairly good.So why the below average rating? Because I simply didn't like it, I respect what they've done here but ultimately it is an unnerving little arthouse film and just didn't entertain me.I get the appeal, but it wasn't for me.The Good:Jason IsaacsThe Bad:Makes for some nasty viewing in placesJust lacks.........something!?",A Cure for Wellness
29,Reno-Rangan,The mysteries behind a misty mountain fortress!,6,24 August 2017,"Seems the films of this director won't survive without Johnny Depp in the lead. Just one good film would change that conception. Is this the one! No, but was very close. After seeing the film I thought it could be based on the novel, but isn't. The writers must be good to create such atmosphere, outside the novel. I was very impressed with the film, though the screenplay lagged the pace. And a few things need to be explained where the narration failed to do so, keeping in mind the average intelligent people. Other than that it is a decent mystery-drama associated with fantasy and sci-fi. Due to a financial crisis in the firm, a young New Yorker goes to the Swiss Alps looking for his boss. At first he struggles to make a contact with him as the staffers are not friendly. After an unexpected incident, he has to stay a bit longer. In those periods, he comes to realise there's something wrong with the place, hence decides to uncover. Does he really do it! His struggles in the attempt and everything else were told in the remaining part.Somewhat it reminded me 'Perfume: The Story of a Murderer'. Not until you finish watching it or figure it out the puzzle. Then the BG score was too cliché for such concept, but nothing can be replaced it. The film had a good opening. Even the mid part. But dragged in the latter section. The overall length of the film was another drawback for the narration.There were no empty scenes, everything's were filled with something, but the end twist was not as phenomenal as promised in the earlier developments. Especially if you had seen a handful of similar masterpieces. It was kind of an old concept, like the pre 80s or something. Yet acceptable at present for being rare. Thus, it depends how well it was made. An above average film, but for those who haven't seen many films in their lives, this will be a great one.6/10",A Cure for Wellness
30,sol-,Curious Cure,8,30 June 2017,"Lusciously shot and deliberately paced, this mystery thriller from Gore Verbinski and Justin Haythe follows a young American executive who travels to the Swiss Alps to visit his company's CEO who has overstayed a planned retreat at a mysterious sanitarium. The film has touches of 'Shutter Island', 'The Name of the Rose' (ancient buildings and hidden passageways) and even 'Safe' (the Todd Haynes movie) with the suggestion that the pressures of modernity can make one ill. Indeed, this philosophical angle, reflected in the title, gives the project most of its edge with the overarching question of whether the sanitarium is so sinister or whether work pressures are making the protagonist sick even if he feels perfectly well. Many have complained about just how long the film takes to explain all the mysteries, but this is a film in which the search is more interesting than the solution (the final twenty minutes of the movie are its weakest with an overt horror plot turn that overshadows things). And it is as a mystery movie that the film shines with the protagonist forced to recall his traumatic childhood and come to question the cold, ambitious lifestyle he has chosen to lead. Dale DeHaan is pitch perfectly cast in the lead role and while the film might drop the ball towards the end, it is quite a ride if has the patience to sit through a lethargically unfolded mystery.",A Cure for Wellness

I feel like this film tries to do a little too much, but still being an effective psychological horror thriller that could have had a worse direction if it was not for Gore Verbinski. He works best at doing a creepy thriller like this film. Yes, the film does have an overlong running time of two and a half hours. I was never once bored with this film. The plot without giving away spoilers about Mr. Lockhart (Dane DeHaan) who has to travel to the Swiss Alps to a water treatment facility that tries to bring wellness to those that needs help. Lockhart needs to bring back one of the patients Pembroke to return to New York cause his company is in parallel. He meets the staffs that are all dressed in white and Doctors, who they all seem, hypnotized or out of place from another era. After Dr. Volmer (Jason Isaac) assured him that he would not want to leave. Meanwhile, Lockhart tries to reach out to Pembroke, he meets Hannah (Mia Goth) a young girl that is waiting to be cured in being well. And he notices that every one has been constantly drinking water and they all take their dose from a blue vial. Lockhart is convinced to try out a few treatments to make him better from being in a water tank, etc. He is not convinced that everyone might be who they say they are, when learning about a dark history. Dane DeHaan was good with his performance; playing a character that is not a person you would root for in the beginning of the movie with his arrogant personality. His character who does have a troubled past with his father, and the paranoia of himself not being well as his mother puts it constantly through flashbacks that he has not been sleeping well. Jason Isaac performance is also kind of creepy and sinister at times. Mia Goth is incredible, seeing a fragile vulnerable girl that probably has not been outside to the real world. There were a couple of unsettling moments in the movie that will make you feel disturbed or squeamish with the treatments. The direction constantly shifts from being mystery suspense to psychological and a thriller. That keeps you wondering, if it is all in Lockhart's head? And he is sent there for a reason. Or Did Lockhart discover something sinister about the facility? Is there really a cure for wellness and being better? These questions constantly keeping going back and forth which can also be the downside that makes the film a bit anti-climatic. The film does have a couple of twists and turns with the direction. I thought the final reveal did pay off and better than I expected, with the answers to the question that the film sets up. A Cure for Wellness is a pretty fair film, it does have its overload with being anti-climatic with a lot going on and feels like it had a couple of different endings.

Essentially a large financial company send an employee to a sanitarium so that they can bring back a patient. Although, we all know it was never going to be as simple as that. There is a 'Shutter Island' feel to this, comparisons are inevitable. However that was more psychologically stimulating, this was more attentive to creepy imagery. Suffice to say, it was an ethereal haunting experience that I pleasantly enjoyed. An institution containing many secrets, I thought the setting and environment was suitably unnerving. An early 20th century complex disillusioning its patients that the modern world contaminates the mind and body. It was meticulously designed, particularly some of the experiment procedures. I felt the story was fairly safe and predictable for a thriller, which is its biggest downfall. When I thought all hope was lost, the final twenty minutes played out and I was truly captivated. Should've seen it coming but I didn't...bravo. The stand out is the cinematography. Wow. Everything looked absolutely gorgeous. I couldn't fault the quality of what was being produced.

There is a stunning shot of the speeding train and the mountains in the beginning.

There's a scene where the male staff just masturbates while the female nurse just stands revealing her tits.

In one scene, our hero stares at the ass of the nurse. Ther r lots of rich old male clients n hot nurses. First i thought maybe it might be similar to the cult of Osho.

At least an hour of its most repetitive elements could be cut. Lockhart spends a long time sneaking around the grounds of the hospital making horrific finds in rooms that he shouldn't be in. Then he's caught, tortured a little bit and send back to his room to sneak out and start it all over again. It's like he's in a point and click video game that he keeps getting wrong. The films has an abundance of ideas, which wouldn't always be a drawback, but here many of them either don't pay off and are abandoned, or directly contradict each other, particularly when you reach the films climax. Cinematic observers often lament the demise of the mid-budget Hollywood movie. On the evidence of this, they should look to the squandering of the opportunities given, rather than berating the alternatives.",A Cure for Wellness
38,paul-allaer,Impressive first half but sizzles out in the second half,6,20 February 2017,"""A Cure for Wellness"" (2016 release; 146 min.) brings the story of Lockhart, an up-and-coming financial services firm employee who's just gotten a nice promotion. He gets called to appear before the board, where he (and we) learn that the company's CEO is holed up at a wellness center in Switzerland, and refuses to return to NY. The board tasks Lockhart to go to Switzerland and bring the CEO back, so that a big transaction (a merger) can be completed. When Lockhart arrives at the wellness center, he is just minutes past the allowed visitors hours, but he is turned away nevertheless. On the way back from the wellness center to the hotel, Lockhart's car crashes head-on into a deer, causing an all-out crash. Next thing we know, Lockhart wakes up in the wellness center, having slept for 3 days straight, and with his right less in a cast. What will become of Lockhart? What has happened to the CEO? And what is really going on at the wellness center. At this point we're 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from director (and co-creator of the story) Gore Verbinski, best known for the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise and, even earlier, The Ring. Here, he and screenplay writer Justin Haythe (with whom he made The Lone Ranger) dream up a science fiction of sorts where we are left wondering what in the heck is going on at that wellness center, the Swiss equivalent of Hotel California ""where no-one ever leaves"", we are told. The first half of the movie was spellbinding for several reasons: the on-going mystery as to what is happening and hence the curiosity in which direction the movie ultimately would go, the pure eye-candy that is the movie's stunning photography, the maze-like layout of the castle what hosts the wellness center (think: The Shining times 10), etc. But then a funny thing happens: as the mystery that enshrines the movie's first half is finally revealed and eventually resolved, the movie gets less and less interesting. In other words: the build-up is wonderful, but then the makers needed to give us a pay-off, and alas that is severely lacking. That is frustrating when the movie is 2 1/2 hrs. long. The mostly no-names cast does great, in particular Dane DeHaan (as Lockhart), who reminded me of a younger Leonardo DiCaprio in style if not appearance. Last but certainly not least, there is a wonderful score, courtesy of composer Benjamin Wallfisch.""A Cure for Wellness"" opened wide this past weekend. The Sunday matinée screening where I saw this at was attended so-so, and in fact he movie underperformed at the box office, grossing only $4 mill through Sunday. I can't say that surprises me, as I don't see people coming out en masse for a 2 1/2 hr. science fiction mystery that impresses in the first half, but then sizzles out in the second half. That said, if you are curious about its premise, or simply a fan of director Verbinski, I'd suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray and come to your own conclusion about this.",A Cure for Wellness
39,subxerogravity,Wow! That was good! confusing but enjoyable.,6,18 February 2017,"When I saw the trailer mouths ago, It looked weak, not worth anything, so I did come into this with a lackluster attitude. Imagine my surprise that it was real good.A mind blowing, strange tale of horror as a young business man needs to save his butt from jail(literally) by getting his boss to come back to New York to handle some business, but the institute where his boss is getting treatment for his illness is a twisted place, selling zen to a group of old people when what they really want is to create chaos and darkness in a film that looks like a smarter episode of Tales From the Crypt.It's also like a Hammer Horror film. This movie satisfies on a level I did not imagine, despite never fully understanding what's going on and it being fairly long (When you think it ends, it doesn't kind of thing)Director, Gore Verbinski does a great job messing with our minds with A Cure For Wellness, it's a fantastic tale of creepy horror, man!

40,jtindahouse,I wanted it to be more,6,19 March 2017,"'A Cure for Wellness' reminded me a lot of Martin Scorsese's 'Shutter Island', a film I absolutely adore. One of the main reasons I love it (however, far from the only reason) is the ending and all the implications it has on everything we have seen previously. Sadly, that's the one thing that was lacking in 'A Cure for Wellness' for my liking. I understand the ending and I can appreciate what it means, but it isn't a memorable ending. It's not one that will lead to endless debate and discussions as to its meaning and possibilities.The film is long at nearly two and half hours. I often say if you're going to make your film that long, you have to have tremendous pacing. 'A Cure for Wellness' I would have to say does. It isn't a film like 'The Dark Knight' that is over in the blink of an eye despite being that long, but it certainly never feels like it is dragging. Most of the scenes are punchy and to the point. The film does come across a little repetitive on occasion, however aside from that I'd say the run time was justified.I'm not sure exactly which type of film viewer I would recommend this to. There are elements of horror but I certainly wouldn't call it out and out. There are elements again of fantasy, but for pure lovers of the fantasy genre there might not be enough during the long run time to keep their attention. Probably mystery lovers are going to be the ones who get the most out of this. There are certainly mysterious elements to the plot line that can be appreciated and enjoyable. I wouldn't say I loved 'A Cure for Wellness', but I certainly didn't hate it either. It just comes across middle of the road. There was squandered potential though, and even if the ending wasn't as satisfactory as I may have liked, it was a fun ride to get there.",A Cure for Wellness
41,RodrigAndrisan,Very good except the end!,6,22 August 2017,"Prepare yourself for something very special! And some harsh scenes... You will feel the ghost of Hitchcock in it but it's different. The film is very good until Volmer, The Chief Doctor(Jason Isaacs) takes his mask off. From that moment, it's completely another film, with a cheesy stupid end(there are about 2 good hours before that). The actors are all good, specially Mia Goth(very special) and Dane DeHaan. Music is cool, especially the theme with that girl voice which repeats obsessively. The cinematography is also very special. It would have been a perfect movie, if it were shorter and with a clever ending. The end is ruining the whole movie.",A Cure for Wellness
42,jadavix,"The best fantasy film since ""Pan's Labyrinth""",8,7 February 2018,"""A Cure for Wellness"" is the best fantasy film since ""Pan's Labyrinth"". Knowing nothing about it as I settled in to watch it, I found myself trying to guess who had directed it. Was it dark fantasy maestro Guillermo Del Toro's latest, or maybe Gilliam had snuck it out without much fanfare? Neither. It's the work of one Gore Verbinski, a filmmaker I admit I had written off as a Hollywood hack. He made the disastrous ""Lone Ranger"" a few years ago, and those ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movies that could have been done by anyone.Verbinski has found his voice, and is clearly a brilliant cinematic stylist. I am going to eagerly anticipate his next film.Unless Johnny Depp is involved.",A Cure for Wellness
43,stevendbeard,Great Visuals But Weird Story,5,19 February 2017,"I saw ""A Cure for Wellness"", starring Dane DeHaan-The Amazing Spider-Man 2, Lincoln; Jason Isaacs-Fury, The Harry Potter movies; Mia Goth- Everest, The Survivalist and Harry Groener-Road to Perdition, Patch Adams.This is a visually stunning looking movie with a weird and confusing story line, at least it was to me. Dane plays an up and coming executive that gets sent to a secluded wellness center in the Swiss Alps to bring back Harry, another executive that had gone there to get cured. It is not said what Harry-or really anyone else at the clinic-is being cured of but I think it had something to do with just plain old day to day stress. Most people at the center say how good they feel since they arrived there, what with no distractions like cell phones or other electronic devices. Jason is the doctor in charge of the facility. When Dane gets into a car accident just outside of the clinic, he is taken there to recuperate-he has a broken leg. Almost everyone at the clinic is old, with the exception of Mia, who tells Dane that she is a special case. And Mia takes a liking to Dane because he is the only one around the place that is close to her age. Needless to say, lots of odd ball stuff is going on. Jason claims that the mountain water is the basis for his curing everyone-he is always making them drink the restorative fluid-but Dane gets suspicious when he finds something in his water that is moving around. Then, Dane starts snooping and sees people floating in water tanks, eels in toilets and bath tubs and even livestock being eviscerated with some weird stomach contents spilling out in front of him. There is also some unwanted dental surgery and a weird scene where a nurse does a strip tease dance in front of an orderly while he pleases himself-he doesn't touch her. Of course, to be fair, some of these things may have been hallucinations but to tell you the truth, I got to where I could not tell which was which. I guess it's just me but I could not figure out lots of the things going on, but it did look good. It's rated ""R"" for disturbing violent content and images, language and sexual content-including nudity and a sexual assault-and has a running time of 2 hours & 26 minutes. It's not one that I would buy on DVD. I don't think it would be a good rental, unless you just like to look at the visuals with the sound turned off. If you want to see it, I would wait until it comes to cable.",A Cure for Wellness

45,parry_na,Spoilers follow ...,6,11 October 2017,"Can you have too much atmosphere? I ask this because I love films that transport the viewer to the fictional world of the production, incite you to shudder at each shadow, marvel at each misty dawn, gasp at the scale of the architecture and actually encourage you to feel you are part of the experience. The very stylish and sublime Swiss rehabilitation centre featured here is extremely scenic and beautiful but at 2 hrs 26 minutes long, your fascination with the mysterious healing base is stretched out too thinly.Dane DeHaan stars as Lockhart, a character who is, at least initially, difficult to like. Strictly a businessman, an ambitious go-getter, someone whose personality is comprised of spreadsheets and business projections, and who is never out of his shirt and tie, he represents the cogs of industry and is surrounded by, manipulated by and obeys the rules of others just like him. Their mission is purely to 'get ahead', to make money, and when he is sent to the mysterious centre of wellness to locate and bring back the man he replaced - Roland Pembroke (Harry Groener) - he considers it a waste of his talents. To balance things, the money he earns helps keep his aged mother in the best care home he can afford. DeHaan plays the role exceptionally well, his ambition slowly being eroded, displaying a semblance of humanity beneath - a nice balance to the apparently benevolent Doctor Volmer (Jason Isaacs), whose 'journey' heads in the opposite direction.For such a driven character, it is ironic that when he is *being* driven to the centre, a mishap with a deer causes a crash that sends him there as a patient. Once there, he experiences the unorthodox, somewhat HP Lovecraft-ian techniques of healing the patients of their alleged maladies. That Lockhart is so arrogant in the face of the peacefulness of the doctors and inmates ensures the audience is far from on his side. Also, the reason The Company need Pembroke back is so they can pin various illegal business activities on him.The finale is a terrific spectacle of Grand Guignol, with the reason finally revealed for all the atrocities committed. The closing scenes are lovingly crafted by Director and Producer Gore Verbinski. It is just possible Verbinski is too in love with the project, for there is no reason it should last 146 minutes. Possibly this is a major factor why the film failed at the box office. The fact that audience attention is allowed to wander on occasion is a huge shame, as intricate and meticulous scenes will be passed over.The ending (SPOILER) is satisfying, with Lockhart rejecting both the wellness 'clinic' and his former life as a business drone.",A Cure for Wellness
46,drownnnsoda,"A tall, cool glass of water—with a contaminant or two",8,21 February 2017,"""A Cure for Wellness"" follows an ambitious, young New York financial executive who is sent to Switzerland to retrieve a colleague who has indefinitely extended his stay at a mountaintop sanitorium known for its therapeutic mineral waters. Hiding behind the veneer of medicine, however, is something far darker.Though it's taken a critical beating, ""A Cure for Wellness"" is a bit of an underdog in my book. It's a big-budget picture backed by a major studio that is a financially dangerous mix of genres, references, and ideas. It's, in a word, ambitious—and a gamble on just about all fronts. The result is phenomenal in many regards, less so in others, but given the current climate of the horror film, this movie offers a lot of things that you simply do not see much of in genre films (or just films in general, for that matter) anymore.One could list the aesthetic references for days, though director Gore Verbinski seems to be heavily influenced by Alfred Hitchcock in compositions, David Cronenberg in theme, and Mario Bava in both—and that's probably just the tip of the iceberg. In any case, the film is visually sumptuous, and honestly one of the best-photographed films I've seen in perhaps years. Stunning compositions of the castle yard and the surrounding Swiss Alps need to be seen to be believed, while the vintage hospital interiors are equally stunning and atmospheric for different (and more sinister) reasons. While the first twenty minutes of the film are wildly contemporary, everything that follows seems to be framed within a pre-World War II vacuum.Needless to say, the film is visually incredible and saturated in a Euro-Gothic atmosphere that to me seemed quite reminiscent of Bava (think ""Kill, Baby... Kill!"" stretched to big-budget parameters). In terms of narrative, the film is borderline mythical, weaving an entire history of the sanitorium that, though contrived, is enough to pique the interest of any self-respecting genre fan. The main problem here is that the unfurling of that history and its relationship to what is happening at the sanitorium is not only semi-predictable, but it begins to drag its feet a bit in the last act of the film, coming to a conclusion that, though appropriate, feels slightly pedestrian. I don't want to say the film devolves, but it certainly does cross the threshold from ""genuinely unique amalgam"" to ""semi-predictable psychological thriller"" somewhere in the third act.In spite of this, however, the film is undeniably fun, and remains engrossing from start to finish; though the two and a half-hour run time could have been trimmed a bit, the film never felt tedious to me, probably because of how skillfully it was able to invent and then wallow in its own world. Solid performances also help; Dane DeHaan convincingly plays the young and assertive financier, while Mia Goth is an ethereal and guileless patient whom he befriends (and who plays a key part in what is to come). Jason Isaacs is also sinister as the cool, self-possessed leader of the hospital.While ""A Cure for Wellness"" certainly deserves some hits for taking a few predictable narrative routes, I am still somewhat surprised that it's gotten the negative feedback it has from critics. I think genre fans will genuinely appreciate it—ranging from sci-fi fans to through-and-through horror cinephiles like myself—because it uses its references smartly and evokes an atmosphere that is truly overpowering. There is enough heady Gothic atmosphere, body horror, and psychological paranoia to keep everybody engaged. Even when it's predictable and even when its own mythos registers too absurd, I can't bring myself to knock it because there is so much it gets right—but I suppose my greater point is that, even when it doesn't get it right, you never feel compelled to look away. 8/10.",A Cure for Wellness
47,kluseba,Genre potpourri with intellectual depth,9,3 November 2017,"A Cure of Wellness is one of the best Western movies in recent memory and it's a mystery to me why this film didn't get the attention it deserved. Many people claim that it bombed at the box office. That's not surprising because I was actively trying to watch the movie but it wasn't shown in any of the numerous movie theaters around me, including multiplexes with up to sixteen screens. If the movie isn't even shown at the cinema, it's obvious that nobody can watch it. I even had some trouble getting my hands on the movie once it was released on DVD and BluRay. Most video rental stores had very few copies and local electronics store chains didn't promote the release either. I'm not certain who is responsible for this horrible release strategy but this may have contributed to the fact that this film unjustifiably passed under the radar.It certainly can't be so unpopular because of the lack of quality. A Cure for Wellness has numerous things going for it. First of all, the gloomy story is entertaining from start to finish. The few predictable elements are outweighed by a stunning finale that one might not see coming and that you will remember for a very long time. I would even say that the movie's conclusion is nearly on the same surprising level as Oldboy, Shutter Island or The Sixth Sense.Secondly, the film has a mysterious atmosphere and is told in a smooth but haunting way. The film is carefully arranged which justifies its epic length of nearly two and a half hours. Thirdly, the locations of the film are absolutely stunning. The movie briefly takes place in the soulless skyscrapers of glass and steel and New York City while the rest of the movie is set in an expensive wellness center in the Swiss Alps. Even though most of the movie was filmed in Germany, the settings look authentic, elegant and haunting as most beautiful spots presented here have something abominable lurking beneath the surface. Fourthly, the movie mixes diverse genres in a creative, diversified and fluid manner. The movie seems to be a psychological thriller but it also includes dramatic and fantastic elements and even adds some minor philosophical elements in the right spots without ever being moralizing. Fifthly, the acting performances are absolutely convincing. Dane DeHaan convinces as ambitious businessman looking for his superior who has gone to a mysterious wellness center. His character looks determined on the outside but feels weakened inside as he slowly realizes that greed and money have replaced his family and friends. The main protagonists and antagonists and even the side characters are so interesting that one is always longing for more details and information about them.This movie is often compared to the brilliant Shutter Island and this is especially true for the mysterious atmosphere, isolated landscapes and sinister plot elements. However, A Cure for Wellness is unique enough to convince due to the smartly employed dramatic elements that portray a set of flawed, haunted and mysterious characters and the shift towards fantastic genre elements in the last quarter of the movie. Shutter Island might have a cleverer twist than A Cure for Wellness but from every other point of view, these two movies are equally strong. That's why I can't understand why Shutter Island rightfully received all the praise it deserved while A Cure for Wellness is overall under-appreciated. If you would like to discover a psychological thriller with dramatic and fantastic elements, gloomy story, mysterious atmosphere, stunning settings and strong acting performances, then this film is worthy of your money, support and time.",A Cure for Wellness
48,aidanratesmovies,"Not Great, but a Very Creative and Unique Little Vision",8,13 March 2021,"With excellent direction from Gore Verbinski, and fantastic lead performances all around- A Cure For Wellness can be a bit predictable- but is truly an original, very dark, and very unique little horror vision which you will certainly not forget. Dane DeHaan and Jason Isaacs lead this interesting slow burn thriller- where everything is not as pleasant as it seems. DeHaan and Mia Goth are excellent throughout the film, perfect for their respective role and their distinct personalities. Verbinski brings a true genius to this film, dabbling in the mysterious ins and outs of the films script in the best of ways. The cinematography is excellent, such a dark but beautiful little atmosphere for the film to roam around in. The score is also excellent, proving to not only be memorable, but provide such an intensity and peculiar enjoyment to the films mccabe matters. The script can be a bit predictable at times, with a few good twists and turns here and there. The film is also a bit of a slow burn, with a 2hr and 26 min runtime, although it certainly is worth it by the end. The films conclusion is a strong one, and perhaps improved my view on the film in general. It's such a unique and disturbing little tale, and truly no one but Verbinski could have achieved its brilliance.

49,questl-18592,A Cure for Repetition,9,2 July 2020,"I have to say, when I finally sat down to watch this I was pleasantly surprised to see that it was nothing like my expectations. I had been told this was a remarkably weird and off-putting film and, while I suppose aspects of that are true enough, that is definitely not the overall takeaway I had. This is a wonderfully symbolic, metaphorical film for so many things in life, for corporations, conglomerates, our own neurosis, all presented in a riveting and dramatic story that left me guessing and invested Fromm start to finish.For the sake of avoiding spoiling anything, I wont say anything about the story, because I truly believe it's better off experienced than summarized. What I can say is that it's shot beautifully, tension is captured and held onto artfully and I was always wondering what was coming next, what was going on beneath the surface, without being distracted from the movie itself. That's an important thing, because there is always a balancing act in films like this. Dip too far into metaphor and you have Mother! A film that makes almost no narrative sense (although I really enjoyed that as well) but if you follow a hard, literal line too strongly it looses out on the whimsy and intrigue and layers, effectively taking complexity and neutering it into plain old vanilla.Possibly the most impressive thing about this was the cast. I watch a fair amount of movies, more than the average person, I'd say and I had fairly limited exposure to most of the people in this film. Dane DeHaan was the crappy Green Goblin in Amazing Spider-Man 2, and that's all I knew him from. Jason Isaacs I've known from a number of rolls but they all seemed relatively similar, as though he was simply always type casted or only had the one note, which I know now to not be true. Beyond that, there's no one with any real name recognition here and still they all delivered captivating performances.My only negative comes with the ending. Not that it's awful by any means, but as I was watching it there was a moment that happened and as soon as I saw it I thought, ""That's a great ending!"" Problem is there's another 20ish minutes after that which... They aren't bad, but they aren't as good as what could have been.One negative aside, this was a delightfully surprising experience and I absolutely recommend this to anyone with an interest in thought provoking suspense films. Oh, actually, other negative that I don't hold against the film, it's wasn't available to stream anywhere at the time of this review, which was frustrating and I know it can be tough to justify throwing money at a film like this, but I'd say it's absolutely worth at least a rental.",A Cure for Wellness

52,Samiam3,"Visually intoxicating, dreary in pace.",6,6 August 2017,"A young wall street executive is sent to Switzerland to retrieve his company's CEO from a sanitarium in the Alps for a business matter. The facility looks like a relic from Cold War Germany; the kind of place that still practices water treatment. After a brutal car accident on the mountain road, our young protagonist himself becomes a patient. As he wanders the curious halls and makes small chat with the other inhabitants and the suspicious head doctor Volmer (Jason Issacs), he begins to see the wheels of a medical conspiracy turning within the walls of the sanitarium.After the box office calamity and foul after taste of Lone Ranger, I was curious to see what Gore Verbinski's next movie would be. A Cure for Wellness is a horror mystery that is deliciously macabre and exquisite in visual composition. Even though the movie takes itself dead seriously, it could easily be taken as camp. It is entertainment for viewers who get off on goosebumps, on sights like a man being force fed baby eel infested water. Unfortunately Verbinski repeats one of his mistakes in Lone Ranger, he stretches out the happenings to the point of ill focus. It runs two and a half hours, and could easily have been a half hour shorter (at least). The overly deliberate pacing feels like a device to mask the lack of story. Behind all the spectacular mountain scenery, expressionist lighting, and surrealist dream sequences is a relatively familiar narrative, an individual who becomes a victim of an institution that sees him an an undermining threat. Movies like Shutter Island and In the Mouth of Madness come to mind.The movie is slow but there are intriguing parts. Our protagonists has a special interest in one patient in particular. Hanna is a fair haired adolescent in a porcelain doll blue dress who looks like she could be a figment of imagination. For a while she seems to be his most reliable friend, but she is also of particular importance to Dr. Volmer. The mystery behind her is unravelled in a fiery climactic half hour that is chaotic and stinks of incest related gimmickry.Full of characters that are largely representational and one-dimensional, the deliberately wooden style of acting is perhaps forgivable. For the cast, it's just a paycheck. The real star of the show is the cinematography. Certain shots are an absolute gem. Verbinski has a good eye but a poor sense of timing.

So yeah, around the second time he could have escaped, the movie starts dragging.

54,rgkarim,"Is there a Cure for Disturbing, Complex, Boredom",6,18 February 2017,"Horror movies continue to storm the theaters this month, and each is certainly its own unique twist on the genre. This weekend, a fairly odd titled movie called A Cure for Wellness has snuck into the theaters. The trailers have painted this one an interesting tale to say the least, promising a mystery to be contained within the walls of former Lucius Malfoy (Jason Isaacs) the sanatorium? Robbie K back to present more thoughts on yet another movie to hit the theaters. Let's get started. LIKES:  Creepy Atmosphere  Unique Twist  DetailedSummary: If you wished for a creepy movie, then consider it granted because A Cure for Wellness is the personification of creepy. The setting itself is more than enough to give you chills, as you delve into an isolated manor on top of the hill where dark, empty hallways and broad smiling staff await to ""treat"" our characters. As Lockhart (Dane DeHaan) delves further into the mystery, he finds more pieces to the ever-shifting puzzle that only further gives you goosebumps. And within these halls is indeed a unique twist to the normal horror story. A Cure for Wellness will certainly have some ""twists"" that you haven't seen before (or haven't seen in a while) that of course has to do with the water they magnify in the trailers. While I can't tell you all the connections that lie within the walls of this film, you should certainly expect it to be detailed. Where many horror movies trade detailed plots for cheap scares, Cure for Wellness does the opposite by making a very complex story with fewer jump moments. You'll have to pay attention to connect the clues, but rest assured the writers did a decent job developing the story to avoid any gaps or loose ends. Nice to see that art hasn't been lost. DISLIKES:  Boring  Long Run Time  A little too convoluted  Stretch of the imagination  DisturbingSummary: While I am impressed with their attention to detail, A Cure for Wellness has many limitations that took the magic away for me. First thing for me was how boring it was. The mystery is intriguing, but all the setup, detective work, and excessive focus on dried out dialogue took away from my curiosity. In addition, Lockhart's treks through the facility have little suspense to them, partially due to the security being surprisingly lax, and the sense of urgency being rather diluted. The overall pace of the film is slow and without anything to spice up the climax, the 150-minute runtime feels much longer. Maybe if the ending had been more satisfying the wait would have been well worth it, but sadly Cure for Wellness failed in this regard for me. While certainly unique, Cure for Wellness got a little too creative at times and stretched into the realm of extremely bizarre. It was an attempt to blend science with magic, as two very different paths blended together into an awkward twist I didn't quite comprehend at first. And even the execution at the end wasn't that impressive, as the cheesy theatrics came to a rushed ending. But the biggest limitation is the number of disturbing scenes contained in this film. Imagine, if you will, the traps of the Saw films. Remember the gore and suffering portrayed in those moments, where our poor cast was forced to scream until they met their fates? Well, this movie mimics those details again, only without Jigsaw's cleverness or convoluted designs. You'll get to see some truly psychotic moments in this film, as Lockhart falls victim to the treatments and ""pampering"" that must have been born in Hell. You can guess that this kind of stuff isn't my particular cup of tea, and while certainly suspenseful at times, our team got excessive in drawing these moments out. Perhaps this is the reason they say you won't sleep at night. The VERDICT:A Cure for Wellness looked to be the unique twist the genre has been lacking for some time. While the mystery is very detailed and developed in this creepy asylum world, it still has some pitfalls that take away from the movie. I'll agree this movie will join the ranks of the cult status films primarily due to the graphic bouts of psychosis and disturbing twists. Past this though, it's not a movie I can recommend for the theater, unless you get certain thrills from this kind of torture. My scores are:Mystery/Thriller: 6.0 Movie Overall: 4.0",A Cure for Wellness
55,vengeance20,Depressingly Beautiful (In A Weird Way),9,1 March 2017,"Just watched this last night after seeing a trailer (which I mistook for Maze Runner 3) & never really latched onto it, it was until then I realised this was an entirely different film.I then saw it was an 18 on the Odeon website & well, who am I to pass the opportunity to watch an adult horror film without annoying teenagers laughing & sniggering ever 5 minutes? Not me! So I went to see this!Upon watching the story was quite confusing & dull looking to begin with, you had no idea what was going on or what was going to happen. It was one of those weird films, as I like to refer to them as. It had a dull & gloomy undertone & a very dark story-line, not to mention the visuals & sheer eccentricness which added to the films dark premise!I thought the film was good, though I didn't know what to think as the film progressed. All I knew is that it kept me on the edge of my seat as it was one of those films you had to keep watching to find out what was going to happen at the end. Now, I admittingly found the film to be stupidly too long & dragged quite a bit at some points, but it wasn't bad or terrible, though it did have a depressingly asylum feeling! That ""Join Us"" kind of feeling that You'll-never-leave-this-place-ever kind of feeling! Quite scary & terrifying to think you're brain washed for life & held captive against your will!I found the story-line to be interesting, & quite sinister when it came to the final scene, I almost felt the film would end on a low note where the doctor would get away with his twisted experiments! But the film plodded along once more to the finale which I found to be great & for filling! The film was depressingly beautiful as I found it to be dark yet a good watch at the same time, Mia Goth was gorgeous & the other actors played their roles well! I overall found this film to be quite good after giving it some thought, I mean, it wasn't bloody but it was a sinister, dark & quite grim in a lot of places & the visuals were something else!9/10",A Cure for Wellness
56,pc95,Contrived and Reprehensible Story Dives Off the Paper,4,5 August 2017,"(spoilers)For about the first 45 min of the runtime or so, director Verbinski sets up what seems to be a promising opening and interesting look to ""A Cure For Wellness"" However over the latter half, writers Justin Haythe and Verbinski cannot hold down the utter contrivance and foolishness of the main character to the point of ridicule and things go seriously awry. The end unfortunately is farcical and betrays this viewers' time and intelligence, but worst of all around the same time to boot is beyond the pale though with a nasty and unsavory sexual attack that is seriously over-the-top and despicable - supposedly trying to pass for entertainment. The whole production and filmmakers ought to feel ashamed and awash with disgust for that alone. 4/10 - devolves into junk.",A Cure for Wellness
57,bkrauser-81-311064,The Existential Dread of Gore Verbinski,7,4 February 2017,"One cannot deny the ingenuity of director Gore Verbinski. At his best, he artfully weaves stories through a centrifuge of age-old storytelling techniques, and sumptuous world-building. Sometimes it feels as if Verbinski creates his worlds without even trying; the filigree and lore of Pirates of the Caribbean (2003-Present) and Rango (2011) exists almost as a state of fact. They exist because, of course they do. Would you want it any other way? A Cure for Wellness takes that same instinct and eye for detail to the stratosphere, providing an opulent and unique playground for all the film's ghouls to play in. The alpine roads leading up to the Swiss sanatorium where we lay our scene, hug the mountains like laces of a tightly fit dress. The naturalism of the verdant bluffs compare starkly to the shimmering glass buildings where our hero Lockhart (DeHaan) has found his professional niche. ""Her eyes are closed because she's dreaming,"" a character says about a ballerina figurine. At the film's height, it certainly feels like we're dreaming.Then we wake up. For me, it was around the time Lockhart takes a trip down the mountain to make a phone call and drink a beer. Up until that time, the plot - a young executive sent to retrieve a company's CEO from a health and wellness retreat, smacked of Dracula (1931) in the best of ways. Once we snap out of Lockhart's head-space however (roughly halfway through the film), all the meticulous setups, all the dreamy mis en scene and all the under the skin horror slips out like water out of an amniotic sac.It's a shame too. The sanatorium, the ambulant patients, the creepy staff all hint to an unspoken horror. The kind that doesn't just go ""Boo!"" in the night but impacts you with clinched anxiety that can hardly be quelled. ""No one ever leaves...why would they want to?"" says Hannah (Goth) the only patient, other than Lockhart under the age of forty. She utters her words with the breathy tone of a ghastly harbinger of doom. It's a common trope but because Mia Goth sells it so well, we want to believe there is unimaginable horror lurking just underneath the surface.Yet while Verbinski has all the visual instincts of a world-class auteur, his taste in stories are surprisingly literal. Visual exploration and motifs concerning existential dread and mortality are confounded by pulpy plot reveals. Real and perceived threats are overwhelmed by last act explanations. Slow-burning scares are drowned out by loud showstopping scenes that don't so much frighten as they do shock. And the CGI, good gravy, that CGI.What it all amounts to is clichés that are just that, clichés. They don't explore the dark recesses of the human mind or find unique ways to scare up some audience goodwill. They don't go outside the box nor do they give us anything substantive outside the baroque horror echo chamber that hasn't been relevant since ""The Fall of the House of Usher"". The clichés, the characters and the sets are simply there to push a plot that feels like they were checking off squares on a horror trope bingo card.Of course if one were to severely penalize every horror film that sprinkled clichés into its soup, we'd never get a horror film worth the admission price. If you exhumed and analyzed every bad thing about A Cure for Wellness, you'd still be left with a fairly good mystery. Not to mention an abundance of scares that are still accomplished the hard way. It's also a handsome film. A fact that shouldn't account for much but does account for something.",A Cure for Wellness
58,Luigi Di Pilla,Begins promisingly but then disappoints,4,2 September 2017,I hoped A Cure for Wellness could work for an above average film but I was wrong. It began interesting with nice pictures from the Swiss alps. It was mysterious and the castle amazing cold. The atmosphere was well developed but the story ends disappointing. I think the writer could have give this movie a better end. I mean it lacks intelligence and some creativity to save this mystery thriller some how. The actors therefor did all a great job here and I am curious to see them in other hopefully better films next time. My wife and me gave together 4/10 (my wife 2 and me 6).Watch instead The Ninth Gate or Gothika.,A Cure for Wellness
59,tomsview,Ends in tears,6,5 July 2017,"I just knew it was going to end badly. After such a build-up how could there be a resolution that would be totally satisfying.I enjoyed the first 80 per cent of this movie. Although I didn't know much about it, the trailer hooked me. It looked like a dark twist on Alan Parker's ""The Road to Wellville"".Lockhart (Dane DeHaan), a young executive from a New York financial firm is sent to retrieve a senior executive from a seemingly idyllic wellness centre in Switzerland run by Dr. Heinreich Volmer (Jason Isaacs). When Lockhart is involved in a car accident, he ends up as a patient at the centre. Then things get weird.He meets a mysterious girl, Hannah von Reichmerl (Mia Goth), and there are events that make him wonder if he's losing his mind. You know a horror movie is on track when a live, healthy tooth is drilled without anaesthetic. So far, so good.Now being a devotee of this kind of movie, I thought the story could have gone in a number of directions. There was the possibility Lockhart was killed in the car accident and just didn't know it: ""Carnival of Souls"", ""The Sixth Sense, and ""November"". He could have been having a schizophrenic episode à la ""A Beautiful Mind"", ""Mulholland Dr."", ""Woman in the Fifth"" etc. Or it could have been an elaborate sci-fi set up as in ""Vanilla Sky"". Mind you, I would have been disappointed if it had been any of those; I was hoping for something original.There was some business about the suicide of Lockhart's father, which could have provided an avenue for the filmmakers, but nothing came of it. That's where I think the opportunity was missed to bring this baby home.Writer/director Gore Verbinski gave us an ending straight out of the Roger Corman horror movie manual 1964. Except for the sex, Dr. Volmer could have been played by Vincent Price.I also think Mia Goth could have been treated better. Nudity is still a little iffy in mainstream movies and it's not handled well here. It comes in late and is a bit shocking, but not in a good way.I don't consider this to be a total turkey, visually and stylistically it is stunning; I like movies that have intriguing build-ups and play with your head. ""A Cure for Wellness"" falters before the fade-out, however there are still things to appreciate before it topples over the edge.",A Cure for Wellness
60,Screen_Blitz,"Gore Verbinski's Gothic horror piece is gross and overlong, but surprisingly ambitious in its roots",6,6 June 2017,"A Cure for Wellness is far from your average psychological horror entity. Mixing elements of Stanley Kubrick's 'The Shining' and Martin Scorcese's 'Shutter Island', director Gore Verbinski, the mastermind behind the first three 'Pirates of The Caribbean' entries and the summer blockbuster disaster 'Lone Ranger' ventures into much darker and less family-friendly territory. Undertaking a lurid and twisted look at the moral corruption in the medical field, this remorselessly dark Gothic horror piece puts actor Dane DeHaan in a vicious battle for survival against the unforgiving secrets of a mental hospital with run by a man with sinister intentions up his sleeve. From a thoughtful direction, Gore Verbinski appears to have sincere ambition for this film. It is only too bad however, that the final product fails to live up to its full potential, or at least to the standards Verbinski intends for. Although it is not a poor picture, it is hard to escape the feeling that something is missing. This film centers on Lockhart (played by Dane DeHaan), a bold Wall Street employee who's sent to a mental hospital run by Dr. Volmer (played by Jason Isaacs) to retrieve his company's CEO Richard Pembroke (played by Harry Groener) who happens to be a patient there. Upon failing to convince the old man to leave, Lockhart suffers a nasty car wreck and is enrolled into the hospital for treatment. Upon meeting a mysterious young patient named Hannah (played by Mia Goth), Lockhart is exposed to the sinister secrets behind the hospital's so-called medical treatments. If there are two major obstacles that can keep this movie from posing as an enjoyable ride, the first would be the ugly and gruesome imagery that pervades the film's grim atmosphere, and the other would be the bloated 146-minute runtime which accounts to a slow pacing throughout the first hour. For the weak stomach, the former will serve as a bigger hurdle as there is plenty of grisly imagery and aberrant acts of cruelty to put sensitive viewers in discomforting positions. It is possible however, that Gore Verbinski could put this twisted content to an advantage, and that is keeping things scary. While the director does an acceptable job at keeping the tension and infusing some effective twists and turns that account for an occasionally haunting experience, it appears that he occasionally struggles on deciding what directions to take the story. Aside from inducting a few intriguing concepts involving the grim history behind the old hospital and the dubious nature of Dr. Volmer's medical practices, Verbinski also brings a hefty hand in flourishing the atmosphere with a striking visual methodology that owes homages to 'Shutter Island', particularly the production design of the mental hospital which looks an awful like something ripped from the Victorian era. Should I also mention the nifty cinematography by Bojan Bazelli As for the performances, Dane DeHaan is fine in the lead role. It is too bad that the script fails to make his character more interesting. Mia Goth on the other hand, shines with more compulsion and invests in an striking performance that suits the enigmatic nature of her mentally ambiguous character. A Cure for Wellness is a disturbing, gross, yet ambitious Gothic horror vehicle that manages to bring out both the best and the worst of Gore Verbinski's directorial dexterity. It is a film that is rich with interesting ideas, but struggles on how to use them. The result is a surface level horror piece that fails to meet the height of its potential. In final words, it is a picture that is worth a try. But those with weak stomachs or in the under 17-set need not apply.",A Cure for Wellness

64,rockman182,A Cure for Wellness (2017),7,19 February 2017,"Gore Verbinski is a bit of a hit or miss director. I think The Ring was a fantastic horror film but The Pirates of the Caribbean films aren't that great (outside of the first one which is fun). He's a visual filmmaker as you can tell from a work like Rango but can also bomb miserably like he did with The Lone Ranger. I was so intrigued by this films posters and trailer. After experiencing this film I will say that this film is visually fantastic as the scenes are shot so beautifully even if most of it is dark and grim looking. This film will divide audiences, I can see many hating it and becoming impatient with it. I for one, thought it was very good and worth the time and money.The film is about a man named Lockhart who travels to a wellness center in the Swiss Alps to find his boss who mysteriously just disappeared to that location. When he goes there he immediately notices that things aren't what they seem and that the facility harbors a very dark secret and the film spends time exploring all the crazy stuff that occurs. I want to keep this as spoiler free as possible but I have to share a bunch of things I really liked about this film. First off, let me say that this film doesn't feel wholly original. I kept thinking of Shutter Island when watching the film. That's fine because the film has a lot more going for it. The cinematography of the film at times is just gorgeous. I believe most of the film was shot out in Germany. All the scenes that show the facility and the mountainous terrain in the foreground are just wonderful. Its a visually beautiful film even if it is confined to the ugly graying white walls of the sanitarium like facility.I haven't seen Dane DeHaan in much but he was very solid in this. It'll probably be a breakout performance for him and Mia Goth. Mia I've seen in Nymphomaniac Vol. II but she's a star in this. She's naturally and innocently gorgeous in this film. She's a simple yet extremely alluring figure. This film itself is very alluring. Its dark and disturbing and tries to maintain appearances (much like the staff in the facility). The film is slow and long but I think it builds up nicely towards dark secrets. While I'd say the twists and turns aren't very surprising, I really enjoyed everything I saw. There's a bunch of creepy imagery and the film doesn't shy away from sudden violence. Its all lovely in the darkest way.I think this is Verbinski's best film to date because he captured complete institutional madness. Its visually symmetry is so enchanting, so many of these images are gorgeous. However, I felt like the third at of the film is a bit of a weak point. The story gets a bit muddled, predictable, and head scratching all at once. I think this is what holds it back from being a solid 8 out of 10, however I think this film will get an improved rating on a second watch. It's one of those that needs time to sink in because there's just something special lingering about it.7.5/10",A Cure for Wellness
65,rps-2,"One eerie, evil movie",7,13 November 2017,"From the Netflix summary, I didn't know whether I'd be watching a drama or a comedy. It turned out to be a very weird and scary horror film. The settings are both dramatic and scenic. The camera work and effects are excellent.But the key quality is the lurking, implied evil that runs under even the most common, social scenes. Indeed the bad guys are well mannered and charming. But you still know they are up to no good. Negatives? There is a beautifully done train sequence at the beginning of the film but it has no connection to the plot. This is a horror picture, not a travelogue. At one point I was thinking 'well,at least there is no humping scene.."" Fifteen seconds later, there was the mandatory humping scene, complete with kinky overtones. The film runs well over two hours. It's good but it's too long. And the producers run a little wild with an overly long and excessively dramatic ending sprinkled with elaborate special effects, which again clash with the understated menace and evil that are so effective in the first ninety minutes. It's all very well done but, for example, plush, formal ballroom dancing with hundreds of people you haven't seen until now, seems at odds with the low key horror in most of the film. Sometimes less is more. It's different, effective and crammed with the stuff of bad dreams.

68,Squonkamatic,Return of the Euro Horror Thriller,6,2 April 2019,"Seriously. Right down to the demented Count who transforms into a slavering disfigured drooling monster for the big finish down in the Eel Grotto. The plot revels in perverse psycho-sexuality rife with symbolic symbolism symbolized by a barrage of symbols that eventually become a checklist. The film wallows in overtly arty cinematography - the image of the rotund ladies swimming in the pool will stick with you - and boasts one of the most interestingly staged car crashes in movie history. You are in the car with them and for my money it was the high point of the film. Which does go on for about twenty minutes more than it should have: What is it with these film magnates insisting we invest three hours in their forty million dollar movies? Even ALIEN got in & got it done in under two hours for 1/8th of that. Take a hint.Not sure about the eel thing. They are (sorry) repulsive slimy room-temperature cold wriggling things best left alone, in nature, where they belong. We do not wish to drink them or bathe with them, and those of a perverse mindset may be disappointed that the riveting image of Mia Goth languishing in a bathtub filled with them lasts just as long in the complete film as it does on the trailer. I would wish to prefer to think that the majority of their presence in the film is CGI manipulation of some kind - Lots of sensuously undulating swimming eel scenes, including in rehearsed groups like synchronized swimmers. Right. So, they were faked unless being found in the guts of things gutted onscreen. Like, ew.Other than the shock sequences involving the eels the film sets out to try and disturb its viewers rather than ""scare"" them in the traditional sense of the term. I am claustrophobic, have a fear of drowning and will admit to being owned by the depravation tank scene. The main gist of the film is about its location(s), the arty staging of the cinematography, and it's methodology of creating ill at ease within the viewer. The story works up until the big revelatory moment, then languishes in a seemingly arbitrary repeat of certain earlier passages played with a reversed tone. It's to emphasize the disease and corruption which lurks beneath the seemingly placid appearance of this ""heath spa"", a horror film motif the Italians approached with more directness in films like ""Slaughter Hotel"".Is the movie any good? Well, it depends on what you are looking for. I actually liked Dane DeHaan as the schnook sent to endure the action of the film, but you are not watching this for the performances. If you want outright horror with severed heads flying and stuff being blown up you can skip this one. If you like lingering in twisted Freudian psycho-fantasies where everything is a clue and every meaning has more than one interpretation, rent this immediately (selling my DVD/BR after one viewing: am good with one sitting).If you are a fan of ghoulish old Euro Horror creakers you might want to take a look to see what has become of the form: They even burn the place down at the end, which is right out of Hammer Horror. The climactic scene of the wicked Count claiming his daughter (ew, again) to continue the bloodline right out of the Spanish made ""Blood Castle"" and its staging borrowed from Hammer's ""Kiss of the Vampire"". The waltzing scenes come from ""Web of the Spider"" and the creepy little girl music them from any dozens of other continental Euro Thrillers stretching across several genres.The film even references Paul Verhoeven with a kid playing with a ""Robocop"" action figure during a flashback scene just like ""Robocop"" has a kid playing with an action figure in a flashback scene referencing another pop culture form (ROM: Space Knight). It references the reference like it symbolizes the symbolic symbols, namely to the point of overkill which many viewers will find tedious, others fascinating. I found to be more of the same of forms which I enjoy, with just, like, lots of #$*ing eels ... Blehh.Which just goes to show that nobody's made a really new ""original"" horror film since ""Dawn of the Dead"" in 1978. It's been *that* long ...",A Cure for Wellness

71,bob-the-movie-man,Eels Well that Ends Well,6,18 March 2017,"""A Cure for Wellness"" is the latest film from Gore Verbinski, who has delivered an entertainingly mixed bag of movie goodies over the years from the original (western) version of ""The Ring""through three of the first five ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films (for the love of God, please STOP!) to 2013's entertaining if bonkers reworking of ""The Lone Ranger"". Here he is returning to more of the psychological horror of ""The Ring"" but well mixed with a spoonful of Hitchcockian 'Jimmy Stewart, man out of place' intrigue and a heavy dose of baroque Hammer Horror over-indulgence.Dane DeHaan – Harry Osborn in the Andrew Garfield ""Spiderman"" reboot – is a work obsessed investment banker called Lockhart who is coerced by his board into travelling to Switzerland to bring back a senior board member – Pembroke played by Harry Groener – who is a lynchpin in a major merger deal. Pembroke is attending a castle retreat for recuperation but the idyllic rest-home cum spa is not all that it seems to be. As well as having a tragic history, none of the guests ever seem to want to leave it and the villagers are openly hostile to the staff (think ""Beauty and the Beast"" pitchfork -wielding mode).Lockhart doesn't in fact spend the 30 minutes he originally intends to at the castle but much longer, for reasons that are deer to my hart (#dreadfulplayonwords). While there, Lockhart meets the mysterious and waif-like teenager Hannah (the appropriately named Mia Goth, actually aged 24) who is described by the institution's director (Harry Potter's Jason Isaacs) as ""special"".Who is she? What is going on? Where does the creepy gardener/porter go with a trolley each night? I must admit a certain amount of chill runs through my body when I sit in a (UK) cinema and see the big red ""18"" certificate logo appear. I personally find most ""15"" certificate films quickly reach, and often exceed, my tolerance for acceptable levels of screen violence. However, this was a film where the horror was more at a psychological level rather than a physical level: I think it primarily earned its ""18"" certificate for a disturbing scene of rape / attempted rape (we could argue the semantics) that is singularly unpleasant. Here again though, I was more disturbed by the context of the act than what actually gets shown.Cinematically the film has some beautifully rendered moments (by cinematographer Bojan Bazelli, a regular Verbinski collaborator): one of the early scenes of a train rushing in mirrored glory through the Swiss Alps (see below) is just gorgeous. Elsewhere, there are numerous staged shots that again reflect Hitchcock influences, although the mother peering through the magnifying glass unfortunately reminded me strongly of Peter Cushing's hilarious cameo in the Zucker brother's spoof Hitchcockian war film ""Top Secret""! The script by Justin Haythe (""Revolutionary Road"", ""The Lone Ranger"") postulates a clever sub-text to the film: that, as human mice running on the wheel of employment, we are all desperately sick and should be seeking a cure. The fact that the cure is not what it seems is secondary to that message. Haythe's script works successfully in building the tension, helped by an annoyingly catchy music-box melody by composer Benjamin Wallfisch. The action reaches a moment of bleak despair as our hero sits with Hannah by a pool overlooking a spectacular Swiss sunset. ""Great"" I thought "" a nicely cryptic and non-Hollywood ending"". Unfortunately the moment passes, and the film then descends into a rather torrid and silly final act that pisses away much of my goodwill towards the film (and rating stars with it). This also results in the film – at 146 minutes – being about 20 to 30 minutes too long, and a much tighter treatment could have elevated this to a potential classic. DeHaan equips himself well in the lead role, and his striking visual appearance is well used. He reminded me strongly at times of the test-tube love-child of a young DiCaprio and Benicio Del Toro, if you can genetically imagine such a thing! Also making a welcome appearance is Celia Imrie as a puzzle-fanatic who knows something's afoot but can only seem to verbalise that through her puzzle answers. Even though this is classed as a horror film – so you should know what to expect – I do like to sometimes issue warnings for those who might have particular past experiences or phobias that might make a film unwatchable: those related to this film are the aforementioned rape scene; those with odontophobia (the fear of dentists) and those with anguillophobia (the fear of eels), the latter caused presumably by too early an exposure to the horrors of ""The Little Mermaid""! ""A Cure for Wellness"" – shot, by the way, at the Castle Hohenzollern in Baden-Württemberg, Germany – will probably appeal to lovers of Gothic horror, but its over-indulgences are likely to both frustrate and entertain you in equal measure.(For the graphical version of this review, and to comment on it, please visit bob-the-movie-man.com).",A Cure for Wellness

75,Andres-Camara,What a big disappointment,3,3 September 2017,"The truth is that I heard talk about this movie and it caught my attention. I was waiting to see if I could see her. Now that I've seen her, what a pity.The movie initially catches you slowly. It is very slow and not much happens, but with those landscapes, it is as if nature ate you. It also has an atmosphere that is catching you. You know there are things that are not right and you want to know more.The problem is that it is too long, does not know how to carry it and in the end everything becomes crazy.There are times when it is very well used by the director, the slow tempo, but in the end is too much and gets to lengthen the film. I would have liked him to make some more beautiful plans, to have narrated with the camera, the story gave him for it. But he is satisfied with making simple plans.It has a photograph, which when it is at night or in a closed place is enveloping and very good. It gets you into the movie altogether. But when it goes outdoors, it becomes too white and can not even light up against the windows.The movie that started with an idea, then at the end is complicated with several issues and no longer knows where it goes",A Cure for Wellness
76,Alexander_Blanchett,"Great images, good concept but weak execution",5,1 December 2017,"I liked the idea and concept which was original and had some potential. I also liked the setting and enjoy watching Dane DeHaan, so I was glad he got the leading role in a rather major film directed by Gore Verbinski. However the result left me cold. The film was longer than it needed to be. The story itself started well but turned into something that was no longer believable and the conclusion was full of holes and unbelievable in the end. Dane DeHaan held himself well and delivered a solid performance as did Jason Isaacs (good to see him again). A great look was provided. The setting was excellent and the cinematography as well as the production design really great. The score was fine. Those elements were what made the film bearable and watchable while at the end it tried to be more clever for its own good.",A Cure for Wellness
77,CANpatbuck3664,"A Cure for Wellness is Beautiful, Eerie and Extremely Creepy",7,21 February 2017,"*Minor Spoilers Ahead* After a brief introduction of a strange letter arriving at an office building, we join Lockhart (Dane DeHaan) arriving at his office building. He's the new hero in the office, closing a big account that seemed to be out of their reach. He's eyeballing his new office when he's called up to see the board of directors. They congratulate him on getting the account but they mention that they know he did illegal things to secure it. Lockhart expects to be fired but the board has a new problem that needs solving. A key member of the board named Pembroke (Harry Groener) has retreated to a spa in the Swiss Alps and he wrote a letter to the board that says he's never coming back. He's needed in the upcoming merger and the board needs to get him back. The board offers Lockhart a trade, get Pembroke back there by any means necessary and they'll set him up to take the fall for Lockhart's misdeeds. Lockhart agrees and sets out not knowing the dangers lying ahead of him.Right off the bat I was into this movie, the movie does a great job setting up the premise. They guide the viewer up to the castle where the sanitarium is and the build up is excellent. They know how to create tension without using cheap jump scares, instead using the creepy imagery to setup the story. Every person in the sanitarium is menacing and they utilize how off-putting the concept of this spa is with all these antique psychological instruments and the isolated nature of the location. They also play on more specific fears, are you scared of the dentist? If not this movie may jump start that line of thinking. They took the high road, put the work into creating something unique and it shows in the end.The strongest part of The Cure for Wellness is the visual sensibility. This is the best looking movie I've seen in a while. I was floored by how beautiful the scenery was and how they decided to shoot the movie. Some of the sequences are jaw-dropping and extremely creepy. The movie is very grotesque by nature, if you find eels scary this is the movie for you. Its not just the choice to include them, the movie animates them as this invasive force, always present but always hidden in the shadows. They also pack this castle full of this strange equipment. One of my favourite scenes was when Lockhart was suspended in a flooded chamber and he wakes up surrounded by these creatures. Those scenes make this movie worth watching and they helped make this movie better. Instead of casting A-list actors for this movie, they seemed to pick more from the B and C-list and they made some interesting choices. Dane DeHaan is a decent young actor whose career was stunted by The Amazing Spiderman 2. He's very withdrawn for a horror movie protagonist but his performance was different and I appreciated that. Mia Goth did a solid job too. The movie plays into her odd look and she works well within a difficult part. Jason Isaacs was also surprisingly subtle. It's pretty easy to see that he's the (SPOILER) bad guy early but he didn't chew the scenery like most other actors would and he blended into the movie effectively. There aren't many other noteworthy parts but I liked Ivo Nandi as Enrico. You could relate to him, being the only blue collar guy in this crazy world.A Cure for Wellness had 3 issues for me. The first is simple and almost typical for this sub-genre of horror. Lockhart isn't a dumb protagonist but he's slow on the uptake in terms of how much danger he's in and he has chances to escape that he doesn't take. The second is probably the most common criticism you'll hear associated with this movie. It's too long by about a 1/2 hour and while I admired the pace the movie worked at, they could have cut some stuff out and made a more compact and leaner plot. The last problem is that the climax feels a little forced. They slow play the majority of the movie but everything happens so fast in the ending that it's confusing and a little sloppy. I still really enjoyed this movie but it's because of these things that I didn't award it a more impressive grade.A Cure for Wellness is genuinely one of the toughest movies I've had to review for a while. It really is one of the most beautiful and well filmed movies I've seen in a long time, the premise is frightening and the actors/actresses bring their A game. If it only had a tighter edit and the climax wasn't so messy, this would be an 8 or even a 9 easily. I applaud Gore Verbinski and his team for trying something different, both in the genre and for a wide release film. I'm disappointed this didn't do better at the box office, it had an uphill climb and it got overlooked next to stuff like The LEGO Batman, John Wick: Chapter 2 and Fifty Shades Darker (two excellent movies and then one that's not so much). I would technically give this a 7.5/10 and normally I would round up but the more I think about it, I do see why this movie was criticized and it does have some glaring flaws. So I'll go with a 7 but I encourage you to see this. Just go in knowing that it's a slower and more contemplative horror movie and you might really end up liking this.",A Cure for Wellness
78,davidgee,Homage to Hammer and Roger Corman?,6,3 March 2017,"Pretentious title for a pretentious movie. Part psychological thriller, part horror flick, it falls between two stools – and falls a bit flat. Pushy young office junior Lockhart (Dane DeHaan) is sent to a luxury spa in the Swiss Alps to bring home his company's CEO who's badly needed in New York. A car crash on his arrival turns Lockhart into a reluctant patient of Dr Volmer (Jason Isaacs), the clinic's director. The other 'guests' seem to be happy if slightly zombified, all of them old and rich apart from teenager Hannah (Mia Goth), a protegee of Dr Volmer's with a mysterious past. Treatments include immersion in a vast water-tank teeming with giant eels. Eels feature strongly in the movie, although some of them - Spoiler alert - behave like piranhas!The horror element is a lot less horrific than recent ghost and slasher movies have accustomed us to (the 18 certificate may be due to a nasty scene at the dentist's) and involves borrowings from (or perhaps homage to) fondly remembered yesteryear 'classics' of dubious merit from Hammer Studios and Roger Corman. The château- style clinic has strong echoes of Castle Dracula. Hammer would have cast Peter Cushing or Donald Pleasence as Dr Volmer, although – credit where it's due – Jason Isaacs brims with creepiness until the movie's predictably daft climax.The film I kept recalling was Stanley Kubrick's THE SHINING which similarly substituted pretension for the knuckle-chewing scariness of Stephen King's novel and, like A CURE FOR WELLNESS, was painfully slow and at least half an hour too long.",A Cure for Wellness

80,PyroSikTh,"Fantastic Start, Sluggish Middle, Iffy Finale",7,4 December 2017,"A Cure for Wellness begins with the death of a salesman after receiving a mysterious letter from his CEO. The salesman's replacement is sent after the CEO to complete a business merger, and finds him in a bizarre spa in a castle atop the Swiss Alps. But of course, nothing is ever as it seems, as Lockhart finds himself twirling down the plughole of insanity against delusions, hallucinations, and the nagging feeling that something is not right with the place.It builds succinctly enough for a good while. Once it hits the second half it starts to drag a little. As more questions are asked, more answers are implied, and the more chances Lockhart gets to escape, only to be dragged back again. After the third time this happens it starts to get a little tedious. I only watched it a few hours ago and I'm already muddled up as to which brainwashing episode was which and how he snapped out of each. It makes the film feel like it ends over and over again, which is not helped by the gargantuan runtime. There are a number of points where the film could've rolled the credits and it felt like a satisfactory end, keeping just enough of the mystery open to interpretation. Instead it forges ahead to pull back the curtain a little more each time, until we reach the explosive final act where every single question is answered clearly and without wiggle room......And the answers are not great. In fact, the third act almost feels like a completely different movie. The mystery was built up so well that they couldn't figure out how to end it sensibly. Instead they went balls-to-the-wall chucking all rational logic out the window and turning it into a full-on supernatural thriller not too dissimilar to a modern-day Vampire story. And then of course to appease the general public, they shoehorn a half-assed happy ending in as well, because you know, horror movies can't end on a bleak note these days. In fact, pretty much every moment I thought was the perfect place to end it were bleak moments. It just felt right for the film.But one thing A Cure for Wellness does exceptionally is it's aesthetics, particularly early on. The tone and atmosphere of the film is built brilliantly with the use of composition, colouring, and lighting. It feels dark and foreboding. Even the scenes in the city feel almost Gothic in their aesthetic. There's some interesting camera angles as well, like strapping it to the side of a train as it turns a bend into a tunnel. Similarly there's a lot of mirroring and reflections. The position of the camera on the train also allows for the mountain to be reflected back in the train windows with perfect symmetry, tower blocks are reflected in each other across the street, a girl is mirrored by her reflection in the water, an introduction in a room is reflected in the lens of a security camera. There's a lot of clever, interesting, and darkly beautiful visuals in this movie that absolute help elevate it from your run-of-the- mill studio affair. Unfortunately I'm not sure what all this clever symbolism signifies, as the concept of mirrors and reflections aren't really played upon in the film's narrative, but at least it looks good, eh?I have found A Cure for Wellness a really hard film to judge, because it starts out so great. There's a lot to chew on, the atmosphere is palpable, the visuals a spectacle to behold, and as the mystery builds early on you're left pondering questions that feel unanswerable. Once it hits the halfway mark though, it just lags and meanders, retreading the same points it made earlier on. It takes too long to get to the finale, which is executed questionably in itself, and as I mentioned before feels like a different movie. Tighten it up and trim it down to two hours, or maybe a little under, and rework the final act so that it doesn't feel so tacked on, and this film would've flirted with true suspense greatness. I give it a 7/10, which may seem a little generous, but it really was promising from the starting line, and while it never capitalised on that and lost it's way a little, I don't feel it lost it's way enough to mar my enjoyment of it.",A Cure for Wellness
81,rocknrelics,"Great as it stands , but nearly fantastic.",8,11 November 2021,"I knew I had to see this film after seeing the trailer, it really had me intrigued.First off this film is magnificently shot, the sets are wonderful, the atmosphere is fantastic, and to top it all, I have never seen another film quite like it, that is its U. S. P, and also maybe why it's had difficulty finding a big audience? Perhaps it's just a little bit too much 'out there' for today's audiences?I've seen some reviews that say it's overlong, and I have to disagree, I don't feel there's a minute of screen time wasted, and if it had been shorter, I'd have felt cheated.The actors involved all put their hearts and souls into it, and add some great over the top ness when needed.Part grand guignol, part thriller, part 1930s Universal monster movie (that's what the end portion reminded me of!), I found this a thrilling ride, and was only disappointed with the rather lame ending which didn't really give a satisfactory conclusion, but after such a great 2 hours plus, it didn't completely ruin it for me.If you want to be transported to another place for a few hours, please do give this a go, if it hadn't been for the ending, this would have been a 10 from me.",A Cure for Wellness

A Cure for Wellness dances through about twenty different sub genres of psychological, horror, thriller, and even science-fiction. At 90 minutes this film could have well made its points and come in under budget, but I wouldn't have remembered its relatable hooks, haunting imagery, and lived in its unique world unravelling its spool of gonzo ideas.

83,CineMuseFilms,A new take on the Gothic sanatorium horror where wellness is not what you think.,6,22 March 2017,"Narrative tension works like an inclined ramp with the viewer taken to higher levels until they are tripped over the edge for tension relief. The angle is low for comedy and romance, and high for drama and horror. If a film cannot sustain tension we call it flat. Two and a half hours is a very long time for a fantasy horror to sustain tension and that is why A Cure for Wellness (2016) feels more like a eerie melodrama. Once the film's premise is laid out in the first quarter, the narrative tension curve goes the wrong way.The plot line has all the familiar hallmarks of the 'creepy Gothic castle-sanatorium' oeuvre. An ambitious young American executive named Lockhart (Dane DeHaan) is sent to an exclusive 'wellness centre' in the Swiss Alps to retrieve a CEO who is needed to sign a company merger. He brashly breezes in expecting to breeze out in with his CEO in one day, but a strange car crash unexpectedly puts him into the care of the centre's mysterious director Dr. Volmer (Jason Issacs). Shackled by a leg-cast, he discovers a laboratory that conducts wellness research involving carnivorous eels, cadavers suspended in formaldehyde, and unorthodox techniques for blood transfusion. The patients and staff are creepy, but the health-giving properties of the mountain spring water are endlessly spruiked and drinking strongly encouraged. Lockhart meets teenager Hannah (Mia Goth) who turns out to be Volmer's sister but their sibling closeness takes on sinister overtones. When Lockhart uncovers the 200-year history of the castle and its baron, the weird becomes bizarre when it is apparent that ancient sexual rituals are part of Volmer's wellness regime.This film's trailer is deceptive enough to create expectations of a completely different story. To its credit, the filming is highly seductive, with elaborate and imaginative large-scale sets that create a macabre atmosphere that promise an enthralling journey into the unknown. But the promise is not fulfilled. Once the visual spectacle is absorbed and the premise exposed, the storyline meanders rather than gallops and the tension curve goes south. The classic vampiric template is rolled out yet again with only slight adjustments to the method of blood extraction, and incest and rape themes have always been essential elements in this horror fantasy genre. The excellence of its cinematography and set production are unfortunately not matched by anything else in the film.Fans of horror and gore may miss this film because of how it is being marketed. Even those who crack the code and rush it for their next haematology research project will find it a slow grind despite its great Gothic atmospherics. The unlikeable characters make it easy to remain disconnected which in turn makes it hard to stay engaged. With a tension curve that never rises, the climax comes out of the same bottom-drawer that most B-grade horror endings are found.",A Cure for Wellness
84,lathe-of-heaven,"Great throwback to the old Hammer Classics... However, I feel that maybe a different style and better pacing could have improved it. Blu-ray: Very Good A:9 V:8",6,2 June 2017,"This is the kind of movie that after you see it, you have to sit and think about it for a few minutes. Not that it was profoundly deep or anything, but what I mean is that it is a little hard to separate out my conflicting feelings about it. Many others have already mentioned various specifics about the story and the quality of the acting, etc., so I won't bore you with that. Just a few of my basic impressions concerning the style and feel of the film.1. I really like the overall story. I very much enjoy the old Classic 'Mad Scientist' type movies, especially along the lines of the old Hammer films (or as another reviewer put it, 'It was like those stupid UK Horror movies of the 1960's : )2. BUT... although there WERE some nice visual touches to the film and the director clearly is very experienced and knows what he is doing, I honestly didn't think his flashy / non-subtle style really suited this kind of Gothic Horror story. 'PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN', yes. This film, not so much...So, therefore:3. If it had been directed by Guillermo Del Toro, it would have been frigg'n AWESOME! (The visuals would have been WAY more Gothic and the style of direction would have more suited the movie)4. If it had been directed by David Lynch, it would have been frigg'n AMAZING! (We likely wouldn't have known WTF was going on, BUT it would have been soaked and dripping with Mood and Atmosphere)That about sums up my feelings about this movie. LOVE the Classic Gothic Horror theme, but I don't think the director's style was quite a perfect fit for this type story.So, I'd say that the movie is definitely worth seeing, especially if you at all like the Classic Hammer Horror films, especially movies about Mad Scientists. As others have said, the visuals are striking, but I personally would have preferred a more atmospheric Gothic mood and style...",A Cure for Wellness

87,Mike_Devine,Poor execution weighs down this Verbinski effort,5,3 June 2018,"Gore Verbinski has demonstrated time and time again that he can deliver films that strike a chord with the general moviegoing audience. From the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' franchise to the original horror hit 'The Ring,' he's had an understanding of what will resonate and thrill many. In 'A Cure for Wellness,' Verbinski aims high but unfortunately misses the mark.'Wellness' starts out with an interesting premise - a young executive at a financial services firm must travel to a secluded, exclusive resort in the Swiss Alps to retrieve his company's CEO after it becomes impossible to reach him. Sure, this is mysterious and sets us up for what could be a pretty chilling series of events, but as many films tend to do, this one suffers from mediocre execution.What 'Wellness' has working for it is the picturesque scenery and beautiful cinematography. The thing is shot very well, and even the dreary, clinical interior shots within the ""resort"" are surprisingly cool. There are also plenty of unsettling things that transpire throughout the film, and while this is far from a traditional horror movie, it definitely has enough substance to play tricks on your mind. However, this is pretty much where the positives end.One of the biggest misses 'Wellness' has is with the execution of the story. The ""twist"" that is revealed in the climax can be seen from miles and miles away, even before subtle bread crumbs are dropped in the second act. This predictability distracts from the rest of the film, and it's hard to concentrate on each scene once this gets in your mind. There's also the hollow acting from Dane DeHaan - who proves once again that his wooden performance can take away from a film. To be fair, Mia Goth does not do much better. When weighing all of this together, it's clear that what could have been a great suspense effort actually collapses under its own weight.Verbinski should be encouraged to do more films in the vein of 'A Cure for Wellness,' but he should also learn from its shortcomings before doing so.",A Cure for Wellness

I thought it was creepy and made me think twice about a spa vacation. When a senior CEO, Pembrook( Harry Groener) goes to a wellness center in Switzerland, and doesn't come back he writes a letter explaining why. The letter is disturbing and it gets the attention of the other senior heads. A young CEO, Lockhart ( Dane Dehaan) is called into a meeting. There he is given the letter to read; and clearing believes Pembrook has lost his mind. When it is discovered Lockhart has been cooking the books, he is threatened. He is ordered to go to Switzerland, and Pembrook back. Since Pembrook is not sane, they want to put the blame on him. If Lockhart fails, he will face prison time, and be ruined.Lockhart is on his way to Switzerland by a train, the wellness center is high atop the Swiss Alps; and the view is gorgeous. When he arrives he is met by Enrico( The Driver), who takes individuals to and from the center. On the way up Lockhart makes small talk with Enrico. Enrico tells him about the history of the castle where the wellness center is located. Enrico goes on to tell him about the baron and his wife. The baron was so obsessed with a pure bloodline, he realized the only one pure enough to carry his child was his sister. when she was found to be barren, he started to conduct barbaric experiments on the townspeople. One night the people had enough, and came up to the castle. They hung the barren, burnt the barrenness alive, and threw her child in an aquifer. Yes, the baroness was pregnant at the time, the child survived. He goes on to say the story is about 200 years old. When Lockhart arrives, he reports to the nurses station. There he meets this bizarre nurse( Natalia Bobrich). She tells him visiting hours have ended at 3p.m.. He is five minutes late, and demands to see a manager. He meet the Deputy Director ( Adrian Schiller). Lockhart notices these blue bottles with liquid in them. The director puts a few drops on his tongue, before talking to him. He tells Lockhart they are vitamins. Lockhart explains that he is here to bring Pembrook back on a red eye flight back to N.Y.. The director tells him Pembrook isn't well enough to travel; but Lockhart says his coming regardless. Then he leaves and tells Lockhart to take him back down the mountain. It's not long after they leave they are involved in an accident with a deer.When Lockhart wakes, he is met by Dr. Vollmer ( Jason Isaacs). He soon realizes he has been there for three days. He tries to get up and realizes his leg is in a cast. Vollmer tells him he isn't a patient, but a guest until he gets well. While there he makes friend with some of the patients, especially Victoria Watkins (Celia Imrie). She loves puzzles, and has a book on the history of the castle. It has pictures that show the castle back in the day, and extensive information on the baron. She continues to tell him about the hanging of the baron, what happens to the bareness, and the child. While there he checks out the center. He comes to a steam room and finds Pembrook. Pembrook has changed and tells him he isn't returning until he is completely well. Lockhart also meets Hanna ( Mia Goth). Hanna is a young girl who is there, until her father is able to come and get her. Her doctor is Vollmer who treats her like his daughter, she goes on to tell Lockhart she is a special case.Vollmer checks up on Lockhart and asks if he is drinking plenty of water, supposedly water is part of the cure. Lockhart notices that all the patients there drink huge amounts of water. During this time Lockhart starts to experience some hallucinations, Vollmer checks him out and orders some test on him. One is putting Lockhart in an isolation tank. This is when Lockhart starts to experience hallucinations of eels. He is then asked to provide a urine sample. When he returns he notices other samples with blood in them. He finds it shocking, does some snooping and finds Pembrook's record. We he sees the dental X-Rays, as well as other infor, he finds it alarming. He keeps the record until he is able to find someone who can translate the finding who is not associated with the center.One night Lockhart see an orderly take a covered patient to the far part of the center; and wonders what is going on. He believes something bizarre is going on at the wellness center. When he sees Victoria the next day she warns him to be careful, a dark presence is all around there. When she tell him this, it gets the attention of the orderly.One Day he asks Hanna if she wants to go into town, just to get away. When they get to a bar, he asks if there is a doctor in town. He find a vet ( Magnus Krepper), Lockhart gives him Pembrooks chart. The vet tells him, Pembrook is not a well man. He says that he, and probably others are suffering from constant dehydration. Lockhart finds this weird, because all the patients there is drink a lot of water. When he and Hanna are found in town they are quickly returned.when he returns he continues to snoop around, he discovered that he is starting to lose teeth. He is able to to get into a restricted part of the wing. He finds disturbing revelations. There are people submerged in water tanks; including Penbrook. there are bodies that are dried up like mummies, then disposed of in an aquifer.He is discovered by Vollmer, and has become a Guinea Pig. Lockhart discovers that the water is actually toxic unless it is filtered properly. Vollmer has him in a filtration tank. he tells Lockhart that the only way to drink the water and survive is having it filtered with the help of eels. The eels are naturally found in the aquifer. They are inserted into the bodies of the patients there. Through them the water is no longer toxic, plus it hold special properties. It gives one a longer lifespan, The blue bottles the staff uses; and those that work close with the wellness center.Near the end of the movie Hanna has her first period. Vollmer notices this and he wants to marry her. A bizarre wedding ceremony takes place, and Vollmer tells Hanna about her mother the baroness.

Hanna is able to get loose with the help of Lockhart; and smacks him good in the face. Vollmer removes whats left of his face and his true face is shown. In the end Lockhart saves Hanna, the wellness center catches fire and the two escape riding down the hill on her bicycle.This movie will give you chills and make your skin craw.

90,Ramascreen,Acquired taste,7,8 February 2017,"Gore Verbinski, the man who gave us the first ""Ring"" movie, the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchise, ""Rango,"" and ""The Lone Ranger"" is now back with this Hitchcockian Gothic psychological thriller designed to keep you guessing till the very end. Even though its final 20 minutes somewhat go off the rails a bit, overall A CURE FOR WELLNESS is stunning, bold and hypnotic.Dane DeHaan plays an ambitious young executive, Lockhart, sent to retrieve his company's missing CEO who's decided to stay at a remote wellness center in the Swiss Alps. What is supposed to be an easy assignment turns into a journey of slowly but surely uncovering the center's dark past, uncovering the real reasons as to why the guests keep staying there, longing for the cure, as Lockhart himself starts to question his own sanity.You will fall in love with the cinematography by DP Bojan Bazelli. Even if you're not a fan of mystery or suspense, Bazelli's cinematography for ""A Cure For Wellness' will leave you floored, the word breathtaking doesn't even begin to fairly describe it. There are shots through the tunnel, around the castle, and even during some of the film's most disturbing moments, they draw you in, gorgeous in every possible way. And the fact that they actually filmed a big chunk on location at Castle Hohenzollern in Germany does help because the place becomes a supporting role.Ever since ""Chronicle,"" Dane DeHaan has been an actor that's caught my attention because I do believe that this rising star has what it takes to be great, A CURE FOR WELLNESS allows him to showcase a tease of that potential. His performance reminds me of Leo DiCaprio's in ""Shutter Island"" and Jack Nicholson's in ""The Shining"" where to a certain extent, you're not certain if they'd eventually cross that line or remain on this side of the fence. A CURE FOR WELLNESS is trippy, it's intriguing, it's filled with all kinds of odd imagery, it's definitely not for the faint of heart. It's a sensory experience type of a film, the kind that also evokes all sorts of questions about society and what it means to live well and the ambition for purity. But again, as I said earlier, the final 20 minutes do go off the rails a bit, by that time the film feels like it runs longer than it should and furthermore it gets ruined by its desire to leave us on a happy note. A CURE FOR WELLNESS will find its audience, but it's an acquired taste.",A Cure for Wellness
91,Dark_Lord_Mark,Old School Modern Gem: Everything Shutter Island Should Have Been,9,3 September 2017,"An Oscar Worthy Gem: Everything Shutter Island Should Have Been.This felt fresh and original. It was well shot, well acted and had a good mystery, drama, thriller, horror feel to it. The music score was very nice and on point.Now the movie is about a man going being forced to go find one of his bosses in a far away land. The events that unfold has a mystery that needs to be solved. This movie rivals anything that Guillmero Del Toro and Martin Scorsese can ever do.It has some disturbing scenes, but it is a meaningful part of the story. IN fact this SHOULD'VE been a Universal Monster movie in many ways, but is simply an underrated gem.",A Cure for Wellness
92,Rendanlovell,"An impressively well rounded, classic horror movie.",9,2 March 2017,"Gore Verbinski has had quite the interesting career so far. He got his real start with 'The Ring' after which he moved into the blockbuster scene with 'Pirates of the Caribbean'. Since then he has had a string of hits and misses but now he is back directing a thriller of sorts. Some people will say that 'The Ring' isn't a good horror film, but I beg to differ. What that film does with its camera work and atmosphere is nothing short of thrilling. So I was excited to see him going back to his roots if you will. And boy was I unprepared for what this film has to offer. The one thing that I will immediately say is that this film is not for everyone. In fact, it's made for almost no one.It feels weird saying that this was done by design, but it was. It's very reminiscent of last years 'Neon Demon' actually. Only two days into its theatrical run it's leaving audiences completely divided on whether it's good or terrible. As I walked out of my theater my speculation was confirmed by someone yelling about how bad it was and also by people talking about how good it was.Much like 'Neon Demon' I lean more towards calling this a good movie. Right off the bat, this film greets you with stunning visuals. Verbinski has really established himself as one of the best directors from a visual standpoint. He seems to effortlessly make scenes stunning. Placing the camera in the exact right spot and brilliantly using color to accentuate a point.Every single shot in the film is just perfect. Whether it's highlighting a disgusting act or just a simple conversation, Verbinski excels. It also helps that he had actors that really committed to their roles. Everyone does a bang up job. Dane DeHaan does an admirable job in the lead role but the stand out here is Jason Isaacs. He plays Volmer, the director of the films central hospital and he is simply mesmerizing. The film starts by showing a guy getting a heart attack and dying. Shortly after this DeHaan is promoted to his position and then quickly sent out on a mission of great import. He is tasked with retrieving his companies CEO from a hospital near the Swiss Alps. Upon arrival, he immediately notices that things aren't as they seem. From here the film progresses in the exact way you'd imagine, however, the journey to that unmistakably predictable end is rather unpredictable.The best thing I can say about the film without spoiling anything is that it's the most disturbing movie I have seen in a while and will certainly be the most disturbing movie I see this year. The last half of this film goes off the rails in all the right ways. It's so insistently vile and grotesque that I couldn't help respect how gutsy it was. A film this repulsive just doesn't get made anymore. And it certainly doesn't get wide releases.But having it playing right next to 'The Lego Batman Movie' feels like a win. I mean, people actually walked out nearly two hours in, in all three of my screenings. They sat there and took it for nearly two hours and then stood up and left. Which is another thing that I believe I won't see in a movie again this year. It's really hard to explain why I liked this film without spoiling things so let's cover the negatives real quick. While there aren't many, they are there and they are noticeable. The biggest one being, the pacing. This film clocks in just under two and a half hours which is long, needless to say, but it unfortunately only feels like it has two hours worth of material. The first half of the film is plagued by this issue. There are endless scenes of our main character slowly wandering about gazing at things. But, as I stated earlier, this movie is about the journey, not the destination. Which actually sort of plays into the message of the film.Yes, there is a message to be had here. I believe the film was attempting to demonstrate how we as humans struggle to find our individual identity. We lose sight of who we are and sometimes the search for our identity drives us insane. It also explored the main reason most of us lose our personal identity. It shows how easy it can be to manipulate us. The film explores this idea of being completely blind to what could be happening right in front of our eyes.Which is what I think the story is mainly about. I have heard many complaints that this has a weak story. I think people are confusing weak with visual. The story here is quite strong but you actually have to piece it together. It trusts you as an audience member to be able to figure things out with out the film explaining them. It's like an elaborate puzzle. It gives you all the pieces to sort it out and then shows you the picture that you are trying to assemble and trusts you to put it together. Needless to say, I loved this film. While It doesn't always hit the marks it wants too, especially during the opening hour, I give huge props to this film for just existing. It's unique, visually stunning, and amazingly vile. If you aren't open to anything beyond what 'Star Wars' delivers then you will absolutely despise this film, much like the people in my theater did. But if you are open to seeing repulsive, disgusting things then you'll probably like it as much as I did.",A Cure for Wellness
93,gustheaffen,"Horribly long, boring, and not remotely thrilling",2,23 May 2018,"After the first 10 minutes the pace completely fell apart and the movie just dragged on for literally more than 2 more hours. Get an editor! People that rave about this being some kind of masterpiece for the filming beauty must love to be bored to tears and are able to forget judging the substance or lack there of in this case. Everyone kept repeating the legend of the curse/fire etc. and fine tuning it, there was no thrill or shock to any of this. We all get people are dying and the water is the culprit along with the stupid legend. Other than some gross gore scenes there was no horror in this. The end is a joke too.

94,CountJonnie,"Why isn't this an 8?? Ah, that's why.....",6,22 October 2017,"A Cure for Wellness was high on our list and we finally got to watch it yesterday. The movie is about a man who travels to a sort of clinic to retrieve a colleague who is there of his own free will, only to discover that many things are not what they seem and leaving won't be easy.The claustrophobic setting of a place that is not even locked up reminded us of Shutter Island and even Dane DeHaan looked like DiCaprio. Other similarities were solid acting, writing, a great setting and a slow but steady pace that kept you on the edge of your seat while wondering where the line was between reality and hallucination.As the movie progressed, and DeHaan discovered that he couldn't just free the colleague that easily, and slowly he realizes he clinic and the workers aren't what they seem. As he loses his grasp on reality and his sanity the main question is if DeHaan can leave at all. This also raises another question: Will this movie go somewhere, or are we stuck in a loop?Unfortunately, it becomes a loop. A loop of walking the same maze, making escape attempts, failing and ending back up in the clinic and wondering what is real. At this point you might ask why the movie is taking so long and why it is so repetitive, while losing any momentum it once had.Strangely enough, everything changes in the last 30 minutes. Just when you expect a non-Hollywood-esque unhappy ending, the movie transforms into something else. The movie speeds up into high-speed storytelling, explaining everything and more action and fantasy than every before in this movie. And as the final 10 minutes approach and you realize why everything is happening, you will also realize why this movie is not an 8, but a 6. Too bad the ending (the whole final 30 minutes) ruins so much.",A Cure for Wellness
95,kaptenvideo-89875,Verbinski knows how to make everything on screen matter,6,21 March 2017,"One of those more ambitious horror movies. Young executive (Dane DeHaan) is sent to retrieve his company's CEO from an idyllic wellness center at a remote location in the Swiss Alps, but soon suspects that something fishy is going on.A Cure for Wellness"" is a curious beast. There's a lot to like about the movie and it wants to try something fresh. But ultimately it's too long and asks more from the viewer than is ready to give back, so approach with caution. Firstly, you will probably like how everything looks. Gore Verbinski's directorial skill of making movie look good are widely known (Pirates of the Caribbean"" 1-3, Rango"", The Lone Ranger"") but this time he also wants to go artsy.The movie is so stylish and carefully composed that many individual frames look like a painting, or some work of art. Verbinski knows how to make everything on screen matter, so often some little thing becomes interesting just because how it is captured or approached. This approach also helps to add some light humor – Verbinski is no Wes Anderson, of course, but it's effective. All in all, the makers have put a lot of effort in world building and it really becomes an interesting place of its own. Just discovering different places alongside the main character becomes a constant source of amusement.The story is also intriguing. For a long while I just followed it without really being able to predict what's gonna happen – always a good thing for mainstream movie. Especially for one which develops its own style but also offers lots of nods to other (horror) stories, movies or directors. Maybe it's just me but I perceived echoes of Dracula, Frankenstein, Cthulhu, King, Poe; from the movies Martin Scorsese's Shutter Island"", Wes Anderson, Tim Burton, ""Saw"". But it's not just mindless copying but tasteful and entertaining in its own right.The problem is for all the wealth of material and lovingly created world, the story and characters are disappointingly shallow.At 144 minutes it is just too long, the story gets stretched too thin, especially the final act. It even dares to turn silly, which differs from the previous tone and sadly manages to lose the interest of many.I still like Verbinski's early-2000's works The Mexican"" and The Weather Man"" better but I was much more emotionally invested watching A Cure for Wellness"" than the Pirates of the Caribbean"" trilogy, Rango"" or The Lone Ranger"".So, I liked most of it, and endured the rest of it. If you like horror and fantasy, you should do the same. Probably. Who am I to say?",A Cure for Wellness
96,dommercaldi,It's Eely Weird And Entails Sloppy Story-telling,5,11 December 2020,"Pros:
1. The neutral colour palette provides the film with a suitably clean, calm, and sterile feel.
2. The immaculate set and costume design also does a fantastic job at feeding into the aforementioned feel.
3. Dane DeHaan (Lockhart), Mia Goth (Hannah), and Jason Isaacs (Volmer) deliver great performances.
4. The score, when used intermittently and correctly, cements a tense, yet ethereal atmosphere.
5. The violence and gore are intense, brutal, and impactful.Cons:
1. The story makes no sense and it just seems to have been concocted as a way to criticise modern-greed - whether it be sexual or financial.
2. The Bill Morris (Craig Wroe) sub-plot at the beginning is pointless as it adds nothing to the story.
3. The CGI stag looks incredibly fake and thus is distracting.
4. The score, at times, is a little too overbearing as well as sounding too futuristic at certain points.
5. Some of the shots clearly take place in front of a green screen.
6. The special effects burnt face of Volmer looks distractingly bad, especially as it looks like a load of green jelly dumped on top of a skull.
7. Somehow Lockhart overturns his leech possession by looking and caressing a ballerina doll made by his mother. It's rather lazy and convenient plot writing.
8. Lockhart's backstory in regards to his strained relationship with his mother, and his non-existent relationship with his father, is brought up for cheap emotional manipulation that falls flat and nothing else.",A Cure for Wellness
97,trublu215,A Bloated Yet Gorgeous Mess,3,8 July 2017,"A Cure for Wellness is the latest addition to Gore Verbinski's filmography and while it has more things wrong with it to count, it boasts enough visual style to keep the film's imagery as intriguing as possible. Telling the story of a young hot shot businessman named Lockheart (Dane DeHaan) as he must go to Switzerland to locate a missing business associate which leads him to find an institution that appears to force sicknesses on its patients. The film's cast includes DeHaan, Jason Isaac and Mia Goth, all of which do their best with what they have. On paper, this film seems like an amazing mystery thriller that cannot be missed. The reality is this is a ridiculously overwritten, overlong, and idiotic film that could have been so much more.First and foremost, Verbinski's script is incredibly bloated and really doesn't have a pace to it. It moseys along like a lug and lands with a heavy handed thud. Personally, the film felt as if it was trying to emulate films like Shutter Island and Gothika. Instead, it feels like an unoriginal mix of those films and it really becomes annoying especially when the film could have easily been a great film at 90-100 minutes. The fact is, at almost 2 hours and 30 minutes, the film feels like a four epic that HBO should have made. It never reaches its full potential and leaves interesting points throughout the story on the table in the same hasty fashion they were introduced. The biggest issues that I think many people will have with the film are the runtime and the illogical and weak script. The more positive portions of the film are certainly its cinematography and its cast. The cinematography by Bojan Bazelli solidifies a certain and very interesting take on the material that plays into the tension the film wants you to feel. Even if the story doesn't get that feeling across, at least the images do. Overall, A Cure for Wellness leaves much to be desired. Despite a more than able cast and beautiful cinematography, the film just can't hit a stride. The hard truth is that it is a boring movie that is poorly written and ends up making you feel more annoyed than anything. While the images and cast may be attractive, there are simply too many issues with the film to recommend.",A Cure for Wellness
98,darkreignn,"Reminded me of why I love movies, but also why I hate them",5,9 August 2017,"God, what a beautiful, visually stunning, stuttering mess. I haven't seen a movie this gorgeously mediocre in a long time, and I've seen every major release this year. I don't even know where to begin, sweet Christ Almighty. Alright, first of all, this movie looks freaking amazing, like jaw- droppingly amazing. Imagine the most attractive person you've ever seen, multiply that by ten, and that's what every frame, every shot, and every scene of this movie looks like; when the movie started I literally said out loud ""this is why I love movies!"" and then as the film went on I proceeded to moan audibly, worrying my parents, as my eyes lapped up the visuals. If Nicolas Winding Refn watched this movie, I have no doubt he probably climaxed numerous times because ""A Cure for Wellness"" looks this good; it's an eyeball stimulating movie, I'll tell you that much. Seriously, it felt like me eyes were making gentle love to the screen while watching this film, and I haven't had a good eye ******* in a long time. That's about where my praise for this movie ends. You see, some people have praised this movie for being original, and I disagree completely. Yes, this movie is weird af, it's very bizarre but at the same time it's a story we've seen done, and done better, numerous times before. I will not spoil anything about the plot, but let's just say what starts off intriguing gradually turns into a ridiculous, and I mean RIDICULOUS, farce. And the last 20 minutes? You won't believe how stupid this movie becomes. It's still gorgeous, but it's so stupid, almost as if the studio was like ""yeah we need a big fight scene, a villain, and a damsel in distress, Gore you can give us that, right?""The acting isn't much better. It's not awful by any means, but like the rest of the movie, it's just mediocre. Dane DeHaan, who I loved in ""Chronicle"" and ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" and ""Lawless"" gives an adequate but ""ehh"" performance here. In fact, the main reason I wanted to see this movie was because Dane DeHaan was in it, but I'm not sure if he was miscast or trying too hard or what because his performance was almost comedic. He's not bad by any means, he's just so average that it hurts, and we know that he can do better, which makes watching his acting all the more painful.On one level ""A Cure for Wellness"" is a movie that you will enjoy watching solely because of how visually stunning it is, but on another level you'll hate it because of how convoluted and ridiculous its plot it. If you want to spend 2 and a half hours feeling like someone is pleasuring your eyeballs, than by all means watch this movie because you definitely won't regret it, but just don't be alarmed when afterwards, when you're smoking a cigarette in bed, you end up feeling unfilled, disappointed, and a little bit shameful for spending your time with something that doesn't want to love you back, something that is gorgeous on the outside but boring on the inside.",A Cure for Wellness

I thought it was serious. and then when it changes.. some people might not like it, they might feel conned that they were watching something that was so serious one minute, and the next...

100,austin0731,You shouldn't mistake messy storytelling with 'artistic choices',5,25 February 2017,"This movie is definitely a disappointment for me, the process of watching this movie starts with a very intriguing tone and a sort of thought provoking monologue (the hook). But then this movie reaches around one- one and a half hours, it's still not getting anywhere. So here the audiences are still anticipating some sort of big reveal, and then finally, finally the movie ends in the most predictable and unsatisfying way possible. This movie works in just enough horrific and disgusting scenes every time it slows down as if to get those ready to leave the theater to sit back down. I've gotta say that's pretty ingenious. This movie had good performances from Dan Dehaan and all, but it doesn't work. It is certainly beautifully shot and all, but it doesn't work. A cure for wellness tries to tie in so much that nothing is really resolved, really it leaves audiences with quite a confusing ending, but not in a good way. The theme of society having some sort of disease is not played out, the motif of eels not fully realized, and really the most expected ending can already be deciphered from the early scene during a conversation between Dan Dehaan and this other character. This really is a shame, the artistic direction was really amazing and the use of eels I really liked, but it just seems all style and no substance. You cannot argue that this film is trying to take an artistic spin to a very overrun genre, because the narrative of a story should always be at the core of it, and this film has no structure, at every twist and turn another theme is thrown at you and you don't really know what the film is trying to get through to the audiences. I say it is a shame because it really had the potential to propel itself to new heights so long as it chooses to focus on one point and to build on it, but instead we are left with a two and a half hour long drag with bursts of intense, horror sequences. As I said, all style and no substance.",A Cure for Wellness
101,rlaine,"This is what I want from a movie, absolutely great",9,4 February 2018,"This popped up on a streaming service and I hesitated for about a week if I should watch it or not. The score looked ok, but had not heard anything about it (often actually a good thing) and I haven't quite made up my mind about Gore Verbinski yet. I've basically only liked Ring by him so far, and now this. So glad I decided to watch it as it was amazing, easily one of the best movies I've seen in a while.The story is about a young executive Lockhart (Dane DeHaan) who is sent to alps to get a company board member back to work from a mysterious spa to sign some papers. That's all there is to know and it really doesn't even matter. What matters is what happens when Lockhart gets to the spa, which resembles a mental institution in quite a few ways. And things really go weird quite fast and the task isn't quite as easy.First off, the cinematography is amazing. Every single image is a work of art, the movie is an absolute joy to look at. The sets are amazing also, it looks like nothing was spared in making this movie look as good as possible The music also is great and these would already be enough to make this movie enjoyable. But the story is also engaging. It's weird, but at the same time it's strangely normal in a block buster way. It doesn't try to be too smart, but it doesn't let the viewer go easy either. I've seen a good share of movies and series where the lead starts to question his own sanity or nobody seems to believe him. Those can quickly get annoying, but in this case the subject is handled perfectly. Lockhart isn't really questioned or locked up, everything is voluntary, he goes to town for a beer, calls back to the states, talks to cops and a doctor (or a vet actually..), but still he seems to be stuck at the spa. You have a sensation of freedom, yet not. Very nicely done.How the story unfolds in the end is a bit ""strange"" and it's definitely a fantasy movie first. Horror/thriller second, drama third. I suspect that this is why it didn't really make it in the box office, it's a bit of a cross genre movie and not very easily digestable unless you check out your reality filter before entering. The other reason is that there are no a-list big names. Had the lead been played by an a-list actor it might be a whole another story. All the acting is top notch tho, especially DeHaan and I actually thought Jason Isaacs' spa director was portrayed by a german actor.I fully recommend this for those who want a proper cinema experience, but aren't afraid of a bit of a ""different movie"" with no big names, but instead get a masterfully crafted fantasy thriller, with a dash oh horror thrown in.",A Cure for Wellness
102,quaseprovisorio,too disneyesque for its own good.,6,2 May 2020,"This movie has cool cinematography, which i believe it's the best part. the setting in switzerland (allegedly, i don't know where they filmed this but still) is really nice. i did enjoy one or two aspects at the plot (the fact that they're able to leave the place twice is cool) but the main problem is this: it's too cartoonishy to work in other angles.first: the characters look like pawns to the plot. dane de haan is the ""detective"" and he walks too freely in the area. jason isaacs is an actor i like, but his character is like this ""dane de haan walks somewhere he shouldn't - jason isaacs get him and tells him, oh you shouldn't be there blablabla"", and that's pretty much it the whole time. it's almost like sylvester and tweety, even though sylvester tends to get tweety until the end he can't.the truth is also a bit fantasy. what started as a thriller ends up almost like a fantasy film, due to the baron story that we made aware soon in the movie. What puts everything in doubt is the ""is he crazy, is he right"" duality, that a lot of movies have and in a lot of them it works. this one? not very much. mainly because we follow without much problem the fact that the spa center doesn't work exactly for the health of the patients. They're pretty much there in order for the baron to live and for his daughter to live also. period, that's it.and by the way i would love if the thing ""rich people problems, people that are easier gullible in bulcrap such as wellness( and this could be applied to a bunch of ""yoga retreats"" or ""mindfullness experiences), are the ones with money, because they're the only ones that can pay this. the baron is arrogant sure, but he kinda says something like that at the end. unfortunately because he's an asshole and the line is too cliche doesn't work very much.i also didn't find this movie very scary, even though verbinski tried. the scares are one of the reason why this movie was so long - it was not needed, but the kinda fake atmosphere needed to be built like this in order for the viewers to get scared - the teeth thing got me a little bit, but that was it.good things: again the cinematography. the colours are great. the first half an hour ,maybe a bit more, of the movie is interesting to follow. the fact that they're not 100% closed there (even though they are because a lot of villagers follow the baron) it's a good gimmick. the resolutions not that much. and the built up could have been quicker and more effective.agin: not a bad shot movie, technically is very good, it's not awful, but it's not awesome either. i think a 5 or 6 are correct reviews. for now i'll give it a 6, even though i didn't find that enjoyable mostly because how it ended. even though the plot looks almost like a disney or warner cartoon (and the build up doesn't suggest exactly that) it's not a dumb movie, and you can watch it without regrets. just could be way better probably with minor changes - mostly if it chose what it wanted to be: a proper thriller or a fantasy/scary story that looks more like a tale. the film doesn't decide what it wants properly.",A Cure for Wellness

As Lockhart (Dane DeHaan) goes to a place where CEO of company he works for is settled we feel how this place is strange. Then in all circumstances he finds himself in bed and realizes he was in an accident and now is being held in hospital. Now starts a painful and too long exploration of place he found himself in and it lasts almost hour and a half. In that period of time you are thrown a ton of information which has not much sense and constant feeling of disgust from things that are going around. After Lockhart starts to spend some time with Hannah (Mia Goth) a young girl in place where are all old people, Lockhart goes in adventure of discovering that could possibly explain something but ends very badly. At the moment movie starts to explain itself there it becomes so confusing and weird to follow but also predictable to some points. Dr. Heinreich Volmer (Jason Isaacs) starts to understand that Lockhart is man that could not easily be held and now after capturing him got to perform his experiments on him which are also very strange and disgusting and in some points terrifying. And how movie comes closer to the ending it lifts pace and starts to take different approach and always managing to put a thing that was will try to get some emotions that are mixed and not clear how you should feel. Then it ends we are left with dozen of things that are not explained and still confusing which led to some thinking and after some time you realize it was somewhat original movie but also seemed like copy of couple movies and wasn't explained well enough.

It's a disaster anyway, and I am extremely happy to forget about it. What I will say is that this movie is such a hodge-podge of plot lines that it is hard to believe that it was not created by a committee. There are several points at which the movie seems to have come to a conclusion only to lurch off again in a completely new direction. It's as though the movie was complete and then, several times, someone on the writing committee suddenly thought of another plot twist that they hadn't included, so they just bolted it onto the end. It just makes a movie that wasn't that good in the first place even more confusing and unenjoyable. Do yourself a favour: give this flick a big miss.

106,Lewis_Heather787,Completely Underrated !,8,20 September 2017,"One of the many films that I personally forgot to see in the cinema when it was released earlier in the year, oh how much I regret missing this film now. Lets set one thing straight this film is not for everyone, this is not your everyday thriller or mystery or soft horror for that matter. I can completely understand people absolutely hating the film or completely loving this experience, and that's exactly what it is......an experience. Directing - Gore Verbinski has made a very well put together film the camera work in the film is seamless and shows off his talent as a film maker. He doesn't put a foot or shot wrong in the film very good job from start to finish.Dane DeHaan is, in my opinion, a very talented actor its just unfortunate that ""Hollywood"" has tried and failed many times to make him the next best thing. A Cure for Wellness is the type of film where DeHaan belongs and he his brilliant in the film, as the audience you can really get behind him in his struggle. Even though he starts of the film as not a nice guy to put it nicely his character arc in the film is strong and delivered brilliant by DeHaan, he is at the top of his game in this film. The other stand out of the film for me is Mia Goth who plays a really interesting a mysterious character which we don't know a lot about in the beginning, however as the film grows so does her character. She is innocent but slightly peculiar at the same time and is the victim of the whole film her delivery throughout the film is really good. These are the two standouts there is nothing bad to say about the rest they are all good as well Jason Issacs is also really good in the film also. Another positive of the film is the cinematography which is really striking and bold, it sets the tone of the film really early and makes the film haunting but beautiful to look at which is a interesting contrast. Production design especially of the hospital is also really good in a strange way, it is eerily perfect which makes us as the audience doubt its authenticity, well it did for me. The final positive of the film is the most important and that is the story of the film which is brilliantly simple but with a lot of hidden messages and undertones that are striking and woven into the story perfectly. On the surface a film about some off beat ""wellness"" centre in the Swiss alps is strange in its self, couple that together with the main theme of the the film water and the ""cure"" it is elevated to a new level. Everything that as the audience and Dane DeHaan's character is told is put into doubt straight away because nothing adds up about the place. Talking of water the use of the substance throughout the film is so well done that you start to fear it, how is that possible something so innocent turned into something so sinister so easily. The story of this film and depths it reaches changes every time you watch the film. On the other hand there are only two negatives of the film, number one is the pace of the film which is very slow. This is by no means a easy film to watch and it shouldn't be either but you feel as if the end of the film is much quicker than the beginning or the middle, the pace feels slow and uneven. The other negative is the re-watchability of the which could be difficult knowing the pace and length of the film however knowing the enjoyment that can be had watching the film could out balance it. Overall this film is a psychological soft horror thriller that is full of surprises it uses great film making techniques, a incredibly interesting story with great characters and will definitely make you not want to drink water straight after, very creepy and effectively use of water. 80% out of 100 or 8 out of 10 this film is a truly great film and one of the best of the year a real gem, I'm so disappointed I missed it in the cinema. Hopefully this film gets the recognition it deserves as well as audiences time, it will definitely make you uncomfortable!",A Cure for Wellness
107,scb_coldsteel,A Cure for boredom,7,2 October 2018,Finished the movie A Cure for Wellness. Thanks Josh Leggett and John Jurewicz for the recommendation. The movie did a great job crafting suspense and intrigue. I was genuinely interested in what was going to happen throughout the movie. In alot of ways the movie initially reminded me of Shutter Island. The plot was intriguing and kept me guessing most of the time. The film was also shot in a manner that really added to the creepy atmosphere of the film. My biggest criticism being the pacing of the film. The movie could have been cut down quite a bit in length. Overall it was still a solid mystery 7 out of 10.,A Cure for Wellness

109,shoobe01-1,"A near masterpiece, ruined by modern sensibilities",7,6 September 2019,"You've seen all there is to say about the cinematography, and it's true. Wonderfully filmed, and otherwise technically amazing. Great sound effects, editing...Well, it's over long. I even think we can forgive the script, because what makes a taught movie is ruthless editing. Either in storyboard, or later on in post.This is not just too long, it is too much. A lot of the best horror or horror-adjacent drama doesn't over-explain things. And this creepy ""what is going on"" film spends far, far too much time explaining things. Diagrams. Monologuing villains. Oh, and so too much about other storylines that physically drag us from the core of the film.The core is Lockhart. Seeing everything through his eyes works great, for the first say 40 minutes. Then we get cutaways to what is up with Hannah and it's... wrong. Clearly breaks the narrative for me.The last act gets lots of gripes, and I agree in every way. And, one simple change could totally change this movie: skip it. Stop the movie when Lockhart says why would anyone ever leave. Even that great wide shot of him looking over the valley below. Credits. The bad guys win. You, in this situation, would succumb as many others have for decades. That's subtle horror, and could have made it a classic.Instead we have... ugh. That fire-infused fight and the weird ballroom stuff and needlessly shown rapey things. Nope.",A Cure for Wellness
110,Padreviews,6/10 Jason Isaacs steals the show,6,26 February 2017,"A cure for eelness It's in the horror mystery genre , so if you enjoyed cult films such as Wicker Man or Hostel ( which I did ) then it's for you but not quite on the same league . There's also a touch of Dracula , Frankenstein, Phantom of the Opera , I can understand why people are saying Shutter Island but that will send you down the wrong path. Production values were good and location and scenery was breathtaking. Brilliant acting by Jason Isaacs as the Dr Mengele type character . Dane Dehaan didn't look well throughout the film even at the beginning , never quite answered if there's anything in the letter seal ( no spoiler there as it might just be a red herring when you see it you'll understand ) . Mia Goth was well cast and added to the mystery. Good supporting role by Celia Imrie . Not a bad movie , but not a great movie either . Just above average , just a bit weird and a bit too long",A Cure for Wellness
111,somf,Destined for cult status,8,2 February 2017,"Opening up the week after John Wick 2 and 50 shades 2 and the same week as The Great Wall, does not bode well for the R rated box office of one of the most cryptic, deranged, and disturbing films ever made. You will hate this one or love it, not likely to get many in between votes. There are images in this film that I will never get out of my head. I am smarter than your average bear but I really have to see the film again to figure a lot of it out. And though I gave it an 8, I am not sure it is something I want to subject myself to again.I really enjoyed Dane De Haan's performance. I was not familiar with him before this film. Jason Isaac is solid and Mia Goth is a fascinating actress that I had also not seen before. Where do I start? The running theme of eels? The numerous Octagenarian nude scenes? The torture scenes? The cryptic mystery of the Spa? Yes, I think I will start there. We join the De Haan character at Dr. Volmer's Swiss spa as he spends a great amount of the film on squeaky crutches wandering the estate and trying to figure out what the heck is going on. Needless to say, he sees and is subjected to a lot of dark and twisted stuff.Verbinski does a wonderful job at the helm. Everyone has been comparing this to Shutter Island, in pre release, but I was more reminded of Eyes Wide Shut in terms of mysterious atmosphere.When I review a film, I find it difficult to walk the fine line between discussing it and revealing spoilers, so I will not say a whole lot more about this odd film. I do have one final thing to say. I am very liberal about allowing young people to see films but moms and dads trust me on this one. Do not allow pre teens to experience this film. There was a 5 year old at my screening tonight. I told the mom, ""Have fun the next 15 years dealing with how this film affected your son. You should be ashamed."" She told me to go to hell. But seriously parents heed my advice it will save you tons on therapy, bail, and/or rehab.",A Cure for Wellness

First off, the Production Values are excellent, they really spent a lot of money on the sets and settings.Everything is shiny and beautiful. The Cinematography is also amazing, this is really a beautiful movie overall. However, that is all the movie has to offer, everything else is incredibly mediocre, particularly the Script.No explanation on why Lockhart would suddenly be on the Center's side, switch back to against it, back again with the Center and then against it again ...And also the Hospital Staff, how were they brainwashed to helping the Center out? It goes on and on and on, as if many Plot Holes are there just for convenience.The pacing is also very slow, I mean almost two and a half hours?

114,a.lampert,Best movie I've seen this year.,10,4 October 2021,"Gore Verbinsky directed this atmospheric horror film, I'm sure with inspiration from Stanley Kubrick's The Shining and even possibly with a bit of Shutter Island thrown in. In fact Mia Goth, who I hadn't seen before reminded me much of Shelley Duvall in The Shining, with her wide eyed innocent appeal. Other props to compare are the long creepy corridors where you sense something is going to appear out of the walls and scare the crop out of you. I was hooked from the beginning through to the end without a pause. Often very long films sag at some point but not this one, I guess from splendid central performance by it's lead, Dane De Haan, a young actor I've only recently discovered. I had seen him only a month ago playing Billy The Kid in The Kid and was impressed so I was on a winner with him from the start. Jason Isaacs, another actor I haven't really taken much notice of before, although I've seen him, also impressed. The other delight, as I've already mentioned is Mia Goth as the charming female lead and there's the always highly watchable Celia Imrie as an in patient. De Haan, an employee of a large company in the States that has financial problems, is sent on a mission to Germany to bring back one of it's executives, whose presence back in the States is vital to ward off financial ruin. He's in a mysterious health farm run by Isaacs, where the patients all appear to be under some sort of control. When De Haan gets there, we discover that the health spa is situated high on a mountain in a castle like building. Think Dracula's castle and you get the drift. Creepy and at times horrific, I loved every minute of it's two and a half hours. I was unsure about the length, having just the night before, watched the tedious and ever so boring Blade Runner 2049, but this time I didn't want The Cure For Wellness to end.",A Cure for Wellness

117,danielharden,Water Waste Of Time,5,3 March 2017,"A Cure for Wellness is a psychological mystery thriller directed by Gore Verbinski and stars Dane Dehaan and Jason Isaacs, the film tells the story of an ambitious young executive who is sent to a mysterious wellness centre with a dark past for business matters but ends up getting more than he bargained for... Unfortunately the same cannot be said for us, the audience.The best way I can describe my thoughts on A Cure for Wellness is with a relay team. Imagine there is this fantastic relay team that completely dominates the race, every runner pulls their weight and maintains their lead... And then the last guy comes on and is extremely slow and keeps falling over until a couple people over take him making the whole team lose. That last guy is this films screenwriter.I cannot deny that this film looks beautiful. Gore Verbinski directs this movie pretty well, doing the best he possibly can with the film he was given. director of photography Bojan Bazelli does a marvellous job with this film, as the best thing about this film is its visuals. A Cure for Wellness is a visually beautiful movie and so credit to Gore Verbinski, Bojan Bazelli as well as editors Pete Beaudreau and Lance Pereira, as well as everyone on sound and in the cast, as they all came together to make the film look and sound just right.The film contains a handful of odd moments that are by far the best moments of the films thanks to the visuals that make them so bizarre, but these moments are so few and far between and so goes the enjoyment I had with this film.Although all those guys are doing their part very well, unfortunately the script lets the entire film down. This film is a psychological mystery thriller, so the script should be several steps ahead of the audience, challenging them and then throwing them off with many sophisticatedly executed twists, turns and red herrings.... This film does not do this at all. The script gives out clues, but in such terribly obvious ways, be it putting emphasis on certain things that rarely ever get so much screen time, or the practically winking at the camera, less than subtle expositional dialogue Jason Isaacs is given the unlucky job of saying. In fact, at one point a twist is actually revealed to us through the use of intercutting shots, but then about 10-20 minutes later is revealed to the characters as a twist. Never let the audience have more knowledge than the protagonist in these kinds of films, that's a major rookie error right there come on! A Cure for Wellness turns out to be rather big waste of time as it takes a very very long 2 hours 26 minutes to reveal to you everything you worked out for yourself about an hour ago and not a single thing more.Overall, A Cure for Wellness is well shot, directed, edited, acted etc. But, being of a genre where script is key, the script in question fails drastically, bringing the whole film down with it. Also I would like to point out that this was very tame for an 18 certificate and I am amazed this wasn't a 15, seeing as how increasingly desensitised audiences are becoming. Why was this an 18? Oh well, at least the film has one mystery I can't figure out for myself *mic drop*.",A Cure for Wellness

Everything from its promotional material, its visual flare, the themes and story are anything but common. From its initial haunting and gloomy initial credits to its very last unique and disturbing frame, the film pulls you win and puzzles you with a serious of confusing, dark and sometimes downright macabre plot points and images that very few other directors other than Verbinski could convey. Even if more time might have been spent on the visually chilling spectacle rather than on its linear and schematic story development, Gore Verbinski is so apt at carrying a truly terrifying and engaging atmosphere that we recognize that some of its narrative shortcomings are not detrimental at all. A Cure For Wellness is paradoxically one of the most visually beautiful films in recent memory; shot by the director's regular collaborator Bojan Bazelli, this film is as much his to revere as it is Verbinski's.",A Cure for Wellness

122,barbagvido,This is one odd beast,9,24 June 2017,"A Cure for Wellness is a movie directed by Gore Verbinski (The Ring, Pirates of the Caribbean) starring Dane DeHaan and Jason Isaacs and it tells a story about a young businessman going into this medical center and I'm not going to say anything more because I don't know how to say anything without saying too much, I'm just going to say that things get really strange, that's all.This is a hauntingly beautiful movie. The cinematography and the shots are so amazing, it's a joy to watch, but there is the feeling of dread in all that beauty. It's a bit of a slow- burn. Well, not really a bit, the movie is probably way longer than it should be, but so much attention is brought on detail in the first half and it's all pieced together later, you just have to be patient. And don't expect it to unfold in a chaotic way. I mean, things do kick in, but it doesn't all rain down on you. Instead, it happens little by little and the movie stays true to its sense of creeping dread and increasing paranoia to create a unique atmosphere (which completely matches the movie's look and direction). The performances also add heavily to the way you feel. Dane DeHaan is amazing, but each performance is kinda its own. But the problem with it is that I think the third act's structure could have been better executed. It's like they had 3 endings and they couldn't decide which one to go for, so they just kinda stitched them all together. That especially makes the last 20 minutes feel kinda tacked on even though the plot comes full circle. The climax almost feels like it belongs to The Mummy or Dracula or something like that. It doesn't quite match up well and it feels out of place.But even though it has some third act problems, it's still a satisfying enough of a culmination that could have been better structured. But this is the movie you won't forget very soon. In the chaos of all bad low-budget clichéd horror movies, I'm glad we have a beautiful and weird one that embraces its weirdness and sticks out of the crowd.",A Cure for Wellness
123,paulijcalderon,"Distracting moments, but overall a good movie",7,18 February 2017,"This movie is pretty sick, so don't bring any kids. Even though I saw some in the cinema. But, they seemed to have survived it because only the parent walked out when we got to the shocking scenes. I liked a lot parts of it, but others were just a little too strange or hard to watch. Gore Verbinski is a very visual director and his shots are beautiful here. The cinematography is well done, I have no problems with it at all. There are so many images that look iconic, creative and memorable. I will give it a big plus for how it's crafted visually, but I wasn't always on board with the whole movie.Occasional moments in the first act had many typical horror tropes that distracted and annoyed me a little. You probably know the drill; the foreshadowing nightmare, the scary girl singing a calm song etc. I liked it much more whenever it stayed away from that. Luckily those things disappear as we move to the second half and by that point it started getting more interesting. The story starts out well. You obviously know there's something wrong with this Sanatorium place and you want your main character to make it out of there and figure out what's going on. The mystery worked for the most part, but it got confusing and I don't think it was explained that well.I did get invested and I felt bad for Dane DeHaan. He has to go through a a lot of terrible things and it was a true torture to see those things happen. Mange-Man Krepper appears in a minor role and he does the best he can with the screen time he is given. It was nice to see him be there and give some support to our main character. I thought the movie was going to end at a part and I wished it didn't. To my surprise it actually went on for at least another 30 min after that part. The main problem I have was that it was kind of all over the place sometimes and some weird moments took me out of the experience. Some people will say it's predictable and you can assume what's gonna happen. That's not completely true. I thought it was gonna end up in a certain way, but it steered away from that type of ending and it surprised me in the final act with some things I never expected to happen. Maybe it was a little over the top, but it was still an exciting finale.The good things out shined the bad things for me overall and I did like the mystery element. The locations and images are excellent, the performances are good, the sense of dread works well, but some annoying things here and there can be distracting. I don't think it's a bad movie at all because it has many different ideas and its very ambitious. It starts out good, it lost me a little half way through, but it got better towards the finale. Stories about mental institutes and asylums are creepy and this is a good addition to that genre. Horror fans will definitely like this.

The set up and cinematography are terrific, and the atmosphere is creepy and involving. This is actually my favorite kind of horror thriller, where something sinister is behind what looks on the surface like a wonderful setting. This was successfully done in Shutter Island, for example. But after a terrific first hour, the movie begins to drag, and then, rather than becoming more focused, becomes far fetched, and way too long relative to its importance. When the credits finally rolled, I ran to check the box office and budget, and apparently the film was financially a flop, as I expected.

The main character is icy and unlikable, the other characters are similarly distant. Stuff happens, a lot of stuff, some of it great looking, but with nothing to tie it together or the any character depth to engage with, it ends up feeling like you're being taken through a film students visual exhibition that doesn't end soon enough.

It's playing all through the movie and in the end it started to give me a headache.
The surroundings are beautiful and there were many interesting elements to the plot.

So I hope you like Jason Isaacs because there's plenty of that.Overall, it's not THAT bad, but it's extremely generic, forgettable, and when it attempts to cross genres (at some point it goes full 'phantom of the opera for no particular reason), it falls flat on its face.Shame.",A Cure for Wellness
134,andrewmerritt-31652,Crazy but wildly entertaining,10,19 August 2018,"Well, that was a crazy movie. A Cure for Wellness stars Dane DeHaan, Jason Issacs, and Mia Goth. It is directed by Gore Verbinski who gave us the Ring and if you're familiar with his work you know what to expect. The story revolves around this young stockbroker who is tasked to bring in a man named Pembroke who is relaxing at a spa resort in the Swiss Alps. They need him to sign a multi million-dollar deal so he agrees and when he gets there he notices that there is something unusual about this resort. And from there his mind is slowly tested as he begins to debate whether he's insane or not. I have to say that this is one of the most twisted movies I've ever seen and after I finished watching it my mind was still trying to process what I just witnessed. I debated whether or not to give this a bad review, but a part of me deep down said to give it another try. So I watched it again after I watched it yesterday and I have to say that again it is definitely one of the craziest movies I've watched, but I got to say I had a total blast. If I could sum up the movie I would say you have to let your mind go and just roll with it. This movie reminded me of Shutter Island from the first twenty minutes that I honestly thought it was a sequel. Even Dane DeHaan looked a little bit like Leonardo DiCaprio. But this is way more intense and twisted than Shutter Island that if you were to compare the facility from Shutter Island to a Cure for Wellness, a Cure for Wellness would win hands down. And people were bashing this movie calling it trash and Rotten Tomatoes gave it a terrible review, but I personally liked the movie. What I admire about this is Gore Verbinski and Justin Haythe who was the screenwriter decided to make a movie and didn't care what critics would think of this. And I love people who go all out just to make a movie and they don't care if its twisted or too violent or weird, they just let their imagination run wild. So overall, I will say in my personal opinion that this is a fantastic twisted psychological movie and if you have the courage and the stomach to handle it go for it.

One could call this film predictable. So what if it's predictable? Most movies are. Compared to most of the films in cinemas out there, this film's level of predictability is lower than the average. All that said, this is still a good movie. In my opinion, it's very watchable. Its visuals and music are perfect for the cinematic experience. The score composer, Benjamin Wallfisch, did a fine job, as did Gore Verbinski (Pirates Of The Caribbean, The Ring). One commentator went as far as saying it would be better to watch wallpaper dry than this picture, which is a terrible exaggeration. It's far from being not watchable. This is more of a popcorn-movie than most in cinemas right now. I read that the production company (20th century fox) tried to promote the film through a fake news publisher and five different fake news sites with articles providing false information about prominent public figures like Trump and Lady Gaga, ending the articles with the hashtag #cureforwellness. That is NOT the way to promote a movie. No wonder this film was pulled from almost all theaters in the country (2.704 down to 88) in the third week of its release. Something to think about. Meanwhile, abominations on celluloid like The Fast and the Furious franchise get widespread approval. What a joke. I mean, even if this film had no plot at all, which is not the case, just looking at the wonderful locations it was filmed at is enough. The Hohenzollern Castle is one of the most beautiful castles in the world. The Beelitz-Heilstätten, the abandoned hospital used in the movie has been used in movies like Valkyrie. The sets very carefully chosen. The whole movie is very stylish. The composition of colors is exemplary. Every shot is like a feast for the eyes. That, to me, beats watching Vin Diesel's stupid face every time. The actors did a fine job too. With a better script and some changes here and there this film would've been in the same league as Shutter Island and similar films with a sanitarium at the center. 6.9/10 mostly for style.",A Cure for Wellness
136,cmovies-99674,2 1/2 hours of a man crutching his way around hallways...,2,11 August 2017,"PROS:  The one and only thing this movie has going for it is great special effects and editing. A CURE FOR WELLNESS was a beautiful film, if you could look past the terribleness of everything else, the colors were well though out and the scenery in which the film took place was gorgeous. Also the acting wasn't half bad, it wasn't completely good, but it wasn't completely bad either.CONS: Where does one start... Lets start with the fact that this movie is HELLA confusing. The main character wanders around hallways getting startled by absolutely nothing like saunas, wells, water, doors, etc. Then to top it all of he becomes insane for no reason whatsoever. The idea of the movie was greatly lost in translation. Its pathetic attempt for a horror was bogged down by unrealistic images and sciences. Another thing is that the director had so many ideas with no realized endings or solutions to the problems that were created. There was at least 10 completely different stories and plot lines, AND THEY WERE ALL COMPLETELY BONKERS! To add on to all this hate, the ending of the movie was like a slap in the face. It was worthless and gross with no added benefit at all. The ending was fragmented into several pieces and left you with more questions than answers. As a watcher, the end of the movie should be the time when your questions are answered not completely dissed and made fun of.www.chorror.com",A Cure for Wellness
137,iwatchibinge,"For your sanity's sake, don't watch it.",3,30 December 2019,"Almost 3 hrs of nagging pain. Good cinematography which keeps hooked, but too much stretched script with the ending that is pathetic. The least they could have done is some intresting other twist than what they did.
There are so many loopholes too in storyline, if the castle is that old why just a generation between Baron and daughter (so not such old story or castle then); why would wellness centre employees allow Watkins to keep research material even under such tight vigilance, how is she even able to lay hands on the material in first place and then pass it on to Lockhart who then continues to read it without interference! Absurd. Nonsense.
I now have even lesser faith in Netflix suggestion algorithm, which suggested it to me with 96% likeness. So, I got duped. Save your time, move on, there are better things to watch than wasting 3 hours just on father marrying daughter to keep blood line pure.",A Cure for Wellness
138,antony-1,"The ending wasn't great, but the ride was amazing",8,28 July 2019,"I'm sure there are far more eloquent reviews than mine on here. But I wanted to at least give this film a firm thumbs up and discuss some of it.Visually, gorgeous. I love direction like this - everything feels purposeful. I am someone who enjoys watching abandoned building videos on YouTube, often enjoying the majesty that buildings can have even in a derelict state. The director understands the building that forms the bulk of the movie and uses it superbly. It's a true wonder to see.The brooding tension through is equally compelling. I never felt bored, and I say that as someone with a bit of a poor attention span. The ending yes is a bit weird... kind of going down to bog horror stuff. It almost could have been served by the lead sitting on the bench, blissed up... as they say ignorance is bliss.The movie definitely was at it best when it was pushing mystery rather than explanation.I don't feel the two sides of the finance world and the mystery really tie together. A lot is put into the setup and the death of his father, but does it really tie into the story in any meaningful way? I'm not so sure.But certainly the core story, and as the name alludes to, it's about people who are fine but we look for issues in life. That works well.The only trim in story I felt was the village scene. You could have removed it, got about 20 minutes out of the run time and I don't see that it's pivotal to the story at all.Certainly next day the story remains with me. Sometimes it's hard to know if something is deliberate or just poor execution. The way he could keep getting out of his room and causing mischief for example. And some jumps where he's doing something one moment then something else the next... well it leads to a dreamlike state in my memory even more than actually watching it.And that is part of what will drive many people mad who want clear answers. Was it a dream? Was this the dying thoughts of a man who had the heart attack at the beginning, the water lapping at his body leading into the fevered dream. What was it about? Well everything and nothing all at once.But I quite frankly love the ride, even if the ending was a bit of a let down.",A Cure for Wellness

The actress (Mia Goth) who played the young heroine in Von Triers Nymphomaniac 2 and some top notch acting, writing, settings and cinematography. A twisting, winding, thriller, scary, big scale artsy masterpiece.Reading the negative reviews here shows me that a lot of people must be looking for pulp movies.

141,Oberrated,Unique and different for the genre of horror,7,5 July 2017,"Overall, 'A Cure for Wellness' is a fantastically done film from a multitude of different perspectives. The images portrayed, the cinematography, the performances, the overall eerie atmosphere created, among many different elements. Surely to be considered cult- classic status, the film, from my perspective, is a refreshing and extremely well-done horror film. While having a few petty plot-holes and an ending that in my opinion did not fit well for the type of product made for what is about 90% of the film, 'A Cure for Wellness' is a different type of horror that prides itself on the eerie atmosphere and off-the-wall elements it presents to its audience. These elements have the possibility to make them feel as uncomfortable and curious as the main character feels while inside the film. Highly worth the watch for the fans of horror and worth the watch for the audience that enjoys mysterious films that keep you wondering til the very end.-- Oberrated --",A Cure for Wellness
142,daniele-iannarelli,"Well, it had a beautiful setting, at least...",3,23 March 2019,"Started off well, although from the beginning I felt the protagonist to be far too young and just did not suit the role. In fact, his acting was simply clichéd and shallow.The concept was not too bad and, on first impressions, the story started off interestingly. As such, this seemed an interesting mystery thriller up until the point at which the troubled twosome bicycled down to the village, at which point the whole thing became just ridiculous... daft.There follows a fight scene in a bar, in which the adults, fully grown men, are portrayed as too scared to intervene against the weedy, scrawny, wimpish teenage neds... it just did not compute.However, the most ridiculous and cringeworthy scene came with the protagonist's 'speech' to the residents. This was such a cliché as seen in so many movies of the past, where the hero makes everyone see sense and/or awaken from their incarceration by delivering a public pep-talk. Why didn't any of the sanitarium wardens just grab this sapling of a man (looked more a youth, if not a teenager) and frogmarch him away...? His consequent assailing by the patients came across as something from the attack of the zombies, or the mummies, or something else silly.All through the protagonist's stay, he seemed to be allowed to roam wherever he wanted, and with no restriction. I'd have expected him to have been constantly under surveillance as uninvited incarceration is the whole basis of the film.Although I had guessed the secret long before it was revealed (the whole film is so predictable) it reflected many similar film storylines of the past... not least 'Frankenstein', 'The Phantom of the Opera' and a smattering of 'ET'.Just when it seemed like the film was about to end and put us out of our misery, our hero comes to his senses and rescues his damsel in distress. Oh yes... in doing so, he jumps through a fire without himself being set alight and then gets thrown off a wall down 20ft onto a concrete staircase... all with no injuries.This film is terribly miscast, overlong and painfully slow.Disappointing, as the concept was not too bad and started interestingly...~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

143,cyifly-2,Too Hard To Follow And Way Too Long,4,7 January 2018,"Cure starts off a little slow, builds a decent momentum with cult-like suspense, then drags on way too long and falls apart in the end. It had fantastic potential, but that potential was just tossed out. With films like this, you just kind of have to ""go with it."" This was too hard to go with. It got way too confusing, was way too long, had too many unnecessary scenes, way too many editing problems and too many holes in the story. By the time it was over and we get to the dramatic reveal, you can't follow the story and you just don't care because it took so long to get there.I give it 8 stars for cinematography and acting, but 2 stars for writing, directing and editing. It's just not really worth your time, much less your money. I watched it mostly because I have liked some of Gore Verbinski's other stuff, but this was not the quality of work he usually does.",A Cure for Wellness
144,makleen2,"A decent, but poorly-executed Gothic tale",6,27 September 2017,"A Cure for Wellness is a classic Gothic tale, with elements of Frankenstein, Phantom of the Opera, and ""The Fall of the House of Usher."" It was directed by Gore Verbinski and written by Justin Haythe. Verbinski directed the first three Pirates of the Caribbean films, The Ring, and Rango, and Haythe is mostly known for adapting Revolutionary Road for the screen.A Cure for Wellness centers on an ambitious young Wall Street executive named Lockhart (Dane DeHaan), who is sent to retrieve his company's CEO, Roland Pembroke (Harry Groener), from a health spa/hospital built on castle ruins at a remote location in the Swiss Alps. Once there, he breaks his leg in a car accident, and the director, Dr. Heinreich Volmer (Jason Isaacs), invites him to stay and partake in ""the cure.""Over the course of a few days, he learns the castle's gruesome history, and meets a mysterious young woman named Hannah (Mia Goth). Two hundred years ago, the castle's baron tried to conceive a child with his sister to keep the family bloodline pure. The outraged villagers stormed the castle, murdered the baroness, and burnt the castle to the ground. All is not what it seems at Volmer Institute, and Lockhart must get to the bottom of it before it claims him as well.There's a lot going on in this movie. Philosophically, it criticizes modern society and treats ambition as a disease. One character literally works himself to death in the opening credits, and wealthy patients flock to the Volmer Institute and its idyllic surroundings to avoid a similar fate. There is a stark contrast between the ""pure,"" romantic world of the Institute, and the village below, with its dirty residents and nihilistic youth.As the villagers once burned the castle in anger, we have, Dr. Volmer argues, overthrown aristocracy and dethroned God, so all we have left is to worship naked ambition. Dr. Volmer, however, is no crusader. He exploits this modern condition to satisfy motives that are, shall we say, less than pure.By playing on common fears of contaminated drinking water, and inverting water as a symbol of purity, the film tugs at a primal thread. In this movie, we are asked to fear the very thing that keeps us alive.A Cure for Wellness maintains a creepy atmosphere throughout. I love the contrast between the castle ruins, mountains, and scenery, and the sterile, bureaucratic, distinctly early-twentieth century hospital. In many ways, it reminded me of The Road to Wellville (1994), which lampooned the quackery of John Harvey Kellogg and other turn-of-the-century health nuts.The film is not without its flaws. At the risk of sounding nit-picky, the CGI elk Lockhart and his driver run into is terrible. There's no excuse for a CGI animal this bad in a movie made in 2016. Watching the poor animal flop around on the pavement doesn't add anything to the film, and it would have been scarier if we didn't know what kind of animal they hit.More importantly, A Cure for Wellness doesn't work as a mystery. In a good mystery, the audience discovers clues alongside the protagonist. The thrill comes from an ""ah-hah"" moment, as the clues begin to fit together. In this film, Lockhart largely ""solves the mystery"" by being spoon fed answers, sometimes by other patients. If Dr. Volmer wanted to make sure no one discovered what he was doing, why did he leave historical books, records, and articles just lying around where patients could collect them and piece together the castle's terrible history? Finally, Hannah's character is grossly mishandled. The writer and director inexplicably reduced her role to a pretty set piece, a pawn who is just kind of ""around,"" when she is, in reality, central to the whole story.Without Hannah, the movie's central events wouldn't have taken place. **Spoilers** Hannah, it turns out, is the baron (Dr. Volmer)'s daughter. He has been using elderly patients to distill a cure for aging, keeping himself and his daughter alive until she reaches puberty and can become his bride and continue the family bloodline.Dr. Volmer has kept her in the dark about their true identities. She thinks she is sick, and her father will come get her as soon as she's well. After over a century, however, wouldn't she start asking questions about her origins, why she's aging so slowly, why all these other people keep dying, or what exactly is wrong with her? A Cure for Wellness would have been immensely improved if Hannah, not Lockhart, was the protagonist trying to solve the mystery. The arrival of a handsome young man could have been the catalyst that awakened her desire to finally leave, and Dr. Volmer would try to keep Lockhart from helping Hannah discover the awful truth. Instead, she mostly just wanders around looking vacant.Ultimately, this film is visually and thematically interesting, and a cut above its peers. The mostly foreign supporting cast is great. I appreciated seeing a cameo by Michael Mendl, a German television actor who played General Weidling in Downfall (2004). By making Lockhart the protagonist, the filmmakers missed an opportunity for a more compelling story, but it's still a solid psychological thriller.",A Cure for Wellness
145,trevor-82944,Now I Feel Thirsty,4,23 February 2017,"Oh, boy! Aren't psychological mysteries fun? I had no idea what to expect while stepping into the theater to see A Cure for Wellness, besides the usual directing tropes of the bombtastic Gore Verbinski (Pirates of the Caribbean 1, 2, and 3, The Lone Ranger). So naturally, when the opening credits passed and I saw an average Joe forced to travel to a Swiss hospital that utilizes water treatments, I went, ""Wow! This is less like those stupid cheap horror indies, and more like an actual Hollywood production under a reasonable budget! This is by a director who actually tried to communicate something important through his visual style! This ought to be a cult classic!"" Except it just isn't, for some reason.The eerie first scene features a New York employee casually grabbing for a cup of water. He receives a sudden heart attack and collapses onto the floor—dead. The very next chain of events focuses on a stock investor under the victim's business, Lockhart, played by the Mr. Nobody sort of actor Dane DeHaan (The Amazing Spider-Man 2). His boss asks him to travel to Switzerland and convince a colleague to return from his overspent stay at a hospital.Here, things start to turn freaky. All the members are wearing white robes to match the stark architecture of their maze-like home; the cream and white shades of the walls always seemingly closing in on our hero. He has no intention of staying, until a badly rendered CGI deer triggers a car accident, sending his leg into a cast.Eventually, he finds the one he was ordered to bring back to the states, behind the cloak of a steamy sauna. Neither he, nor any of the others receiving water and medicine, has any plans set on leaving. Ever. Although Lockhart does meet one resident who pines for the outside, one much younger than the old and frail patients, one who I might add predictably becomes his love interest.All the sequential events afterward consists of answers piling on top of answers to figure out the hospital's inner workings.You know, they don't call Mr. Verbinski ""Gore"" for nothing. Each small episode splatters plenty of blood across the screen, supported by plenty of naked people hanging it loose for all to see. Although I'd hate to disappoint any of you men expecting a great time, almost all the nudists here are well into their seniority. These disturbing sights are given proper justifications for existing, as proved by a swarm of flesh-hungry eels honored by the community.Though despite the refreshing shock value, the acting quality still falls short—especially with all those exaggerated Swiss accents! Now, I'm mainly referring to the villain, who verbalizes the most obnoxiously obvious British Bad Guy voice. Yeah, so a European country full of fake accents creates a pretty inappropriate backdrop for a creepy asylum. A Cure for Wellness also has little staying power due to its flat mimicry of archetypes already utilized by virtually every European horror ever made. Additionally, any meaningful moments taken for Lockhart and his vulnerable new girlfriend to bond winds up tossed onto on the cutting room floor in service of the thrills.Which leads into the film's biggest problem: the specific argument it's trying to make. It apparently communicates how we cannot un-see the haunting truths of society, but the constant plot twists thrown at us, especially the one at the final frame, contradict said message as if Verbinski couldn't decide which tale he wanted to tell. It instead feels he just resorted to winning us over by spurting out Shyamalan twists, following the leagues of better successful thrillers including Soylent Green and The Wicker Man.As a side note, such suspenseful movies about cult practices are entertaining at first, yet once it's over, you are left thirstier than before. Would learning about the spiritual, occult wonders of water and disease offer any real fulfillment? I have no desire to live under such practices, and I hope the same goes to you.So long story short, A Cure for Wellness resembles getting a head injury while waterskiing.

We've all seen these movies, the protagonist starts in a normal world and finds himself or herself thrown into these extraordinary circumstances. The director was't feeling it. He was feeling the harsh reality of fate drawing tight around your neck like a noose with no room to escape.What does it mean to escape? What does it mean to die? What does it mean to live on? What does it mean to know who you are and who the people around you are? What does it mean to be free? What does it mean to be good?

Lockhart is very quickly skeptical of the center and tries to unravel the mystery.This film is simply captivating. The pacing is phenomenal; I had no idea the movie was two and a half hours as it didn't seem that way in the slightest. The movie continually kept my attention with the multitude of twists and turns. The writers did a good job at not being too obvious on the intended direction. While I was viewing I was able to piece together the truth about half way in but in no way was I 100% certain until the end. The sets, acting and overall mood of this film remind me of Shutter Island. It is dark and depressing for most of it lead by Dane DeHaan of Chronicle/ Amazing Spiderman fame. He was great as the lead character and proved that he could carry a film all by himself. Jason Isaacs was also wonderful as the doctor but he is normally great in everything. This film is not for the squeamish however as some of the scenes would make you think this is a horror movie not a great mystery movie. Not that I'm against gore as it was very impactful for the story.The reason I gave this a seven and not higher is the climax for the most part. The movie also had me saying why more than I wanted as some of the scenes were head scratchers.

The story is about a Wall Street stockbroker who is tasked with retrieving the CEO from a resort in the Swiss Alps; upon entering everything starts to unravel. The acting was great with Dane DeHaan being the main protagonist. He did very good; especially since the only movie I know from him prior was The Amazing Spider-Man. The other star was the antagonist Jason Isaacs as the doctor. The action was well articulated with a few standout scenes; nothing like Predator lol. I must mention there were at least two cringe scenes that made me be like whoa. The cinematography is what really was the cherry on top; beautifully shot scenes and angles. The movie is a psychological/ suspense movie and leans heavy on its tropes, but with a great twist that many may see coming, but one surprise threw me for a loop.

That thing is going to get mighty soggy. That whiskey the doctor poured you was mighty small but when you picked up the glass there was more in it. How can anyone walk around barefoot all the time on those stones and glass? Who is doing what and where did that come from and what for? Wouldn't that fish stink sitting out so long? These, and a zillion other questions, ought not be asked or, hopefully, even thought of except by a knit picking adult like myself. Some reviewer said this show lacked substance. What does that mean? Maybe the show doesn't have confirming, supportive information for what's happening. Maybe it's 'hodgepodgism' at it's best. Maybe it hardly makes sense at all. Maybe it doesn't tie together. And, i say, so what? Early on, i thought 'look at this like it's a comic book'. Then, i thought 'ah, watch this as though it's a dream.' Movies like this, for me, need to be enjoyed as if i were a child suspending judgements or wanting stuff to all make sense. But, just sit back and dig the visuals, the crazies, and some good acting to boot. I could have done without the heavy German accents. But, being in the Alps, i suppose that had to be but i felt it detracted from the flick. I think the casting of DeHann and Goth was wonderful for flavor of the goulish jazz. I like Jason Isaacs but i don't know if i would have gone with him for this flick , at least , not with the German accent. Primarily, this was just laid back 2 1/2 hours of entertainment. Nothing to get all pumped up but an OK time. The acting, music and visuals make this worth the watch. And, you get a nice full 2 hours plus. As far as getting serious about a plot, forget it.

153,johnplocar,"A beautiful sight to witness, but short on substance.",5,3 January 2018,"The movie is not as great or as groundbreaking as it thinks it is. The story about a young and ambitious executive from a business conglomerate is sent to retrieve the company's CEO that is located in a wellness center in the high mountains of Sweden. Once arriving things seem to take a turn for the worse as this young man unravels the horrifying secrets of this strange place.From the description, you can probably gather what is likely to be included in this movie for its plot points, story/character elements, and aesthetics. This takes things seen many times before from similar stories and does nothing new with the material. Even though the camera work and effects are spectacularly thought out and well crafted, the story and characters are rehashed tools who's only purpose is to further the plot at a snail's pace. I thought that the cinematography was gorgeous and inspiring in parts, but this is the perfect example of when ""style over substance"" does not work for a film. The lead, played by Dane DeHaan, is boring. Not that DeHaan necessarily does poorly, I personally find him to be a phenomenal young actor, but he doesn't give much personality or charisma in this role. I don't know if that's at fault of the writing or direction but regardless, the character is bland and totally uninteresting to follow. Although, aside from being bland, the character is also exceedingly moronic; almost at every turn of this story he is doing something stupid that he obviously shouldn't be doing. Whether listening to the creepy doctors that are clearly up to no good, stirring up trouble with said doctors thinking he has the upper hand by threatening then when he's unmistakably at their mercy, drinking things he should know he shouldn't be drinking, going back to the ""wellness center"" after he's made it out and can leave without any difficulty but doesn't. Stupid. Really stupid.There's nothing truly inherently wrong with this film, it is at the end of the day ""fine"". Other than some huge story gaps that the film seemed to have edited out in favor to keep in the sequences that serve no real purpose other than to ""disturb"". I was never disturbed in this movie, never scared or even the least bit creeped out. I sat there, not particularly angry or even all that annoyed by the movie, apart from a few moments. I was just bored. It gave me nothing to be interested in, even its mystery. On paper, the mystery of the ""wellness center"" is fine and I may have been able to get more invested in it if there was a significant amount of this movie cut down because there are so many times it goes with the cliche of there are conversations going along and then before any answers are revealed it cuts it off to be ""eerie"" and ""ambiguous"" but I've seen that done before several times in other similar movies and this movie does that to drag its rather thin plot about forty-five minutes longer than it should be. This movie really is far too long; ""A Cure For Wellness"" clocks in at nearly two and a half hours for a plot that should have been wrapped up at the 100 minute mark, max. By the time all is revealed, I was checked out and didn't care anymore.It is just extremely derivative of many other projects I've seen of this nature; whether we're talking about Martin Scorsese's ""Shutter Island"", the second season of ""American Horror Story"", or even ""Misery"", ""The Shining"" there are numerous aspects taken from those films or movies like them to make up 100% of this one's story. If none of those films were made, this movie could never exist because it borrows so heavily from them. I will say that it was visually interesting with its darkly surreal and disturbing imagery but the majority of it has little to no context to it, amounts to nothing and stops the narrative dead in its tracks just to give the audience some gross-out moments. In a sense I do have to say that I respect the filmmakers for having the balls to release a solid ""R"" rated horror movie with the sequences that it incorporated to the mainstream audience, but without much reason it becomes gratuitous to slog through.I will admit that I was slightly expecting ""A Cure For Wellness"" to be this year's ""The Neon Demon"" in the sense that it would be a highly stylized and gorgeous to look at thriller with some messed up imagery and to a degree it is that, but without any originality or substance to it whatsoever. Whole scenes and extended sequences could have been easily cut and this movie would have been all the stronger for it. As it is, it's not terrible but it could have been so much more. It could have really tackled some psychological themes, played with reality and have given context for some surreal imagery. Instead it settled to be gross while trying to mask itself in rather pretentious writing and direction.",A Cure for Wellness
154,daryopeek,Great cinematography but why doing so much for a simple twist?,7,28 June 2020,"A Cure for Wellness is already a lengthy title, but why they have a need to prolong the duration? For instance, the prolonged sequences feel like a dream for me. Great introduction, playing much on background and aesthetic visuals, able to convey a sense of confined and mysterious way. Kinda reminds me of Midsommar which released years after this film.This movie reveals its premise to the mystery rather quickly, but dispersed around to make us stay seated. The only problem is, why they have the urges to chunk those sequences in particularly long enough buildups and climaxes, even though the premise already scream for answer in the first half of the movie?Many movies with similar topics seem to be okay with shorter running time, so why bother? The details also depicted but seems to not unclear enough to help us dig or gain more rather than what have been explained. By all means, it's a not boring film because they have a good pace and not repetitive or too slow, but to think that it can be shorter with same effect, it's like a waste of time.Therefore I give this movie 7/10. It has qualities and enjoyable, but its prolonged way is something that I would never like to experience again",A Cure for Wellness

156,quridley,Hollow but not bad,7,29 May 2017,"This film is very beautiful, moody and it moves fast. Don't expect any clever surprises or intelligent writing. Its a throwback to lame UK horror films of the 1960s. Full of Gothic flair but low on anything resembling modern storytelling. Shamefully, it starts on a hip and fresh note and then gets buried in clichés and references to better films. At least its inspired by greatness. I wouldn't pay money for this as its too long and too stupid, but its an okay watch if you are bored. In 20 years, hipsters will predictably consider it a ""gem"" for its flair and old-fashioned style. Watch ""wellness"" now so you can laugh at them then.",A Cure for Wellness
157,RLTerry1,"An intriguing, provocative psychological thriller that's an innovative example of neo-noir avant-garde cinema with a touch of mystery.",9,17 February 2017,"Gore Verbinski's A Cure for Wellness is a thought-provoking film that hooks you from the very beginning and continues to draw you into the narrative with its labyrinth of subplots and incredibly beautiful cinematography. Although it certainly borrows turning points and plot devices from past films, A Cure for Wellness provides audiences with an experience that is unique and protects the film from being pigeonholed into any one sub-genre of horror or directly compared to other movies that have similar attributes. With impeccable production designs and serene landscapes juxtaposed against cringe-worthy disturbing imagery, Verbinski's ambitious film is one that cinephiles will appreciate and find enjoyment in discussing the various themes, symbols, and visual storytelling elements that seamlessly work together to create a cinematic experience that stands out against the homogeneous horror/mystery-thriller past films. Justin Haythe's screenplay sets him up for continued success as he demonstrates, with this film, that he can cross into new genres and hook the audience early on. Despite the occasional slow-burning periods in the narrative, you will not likely feel the nearly 2.5hr runtime.Beautiful. The first cinematic element that will jump out at you will be the incredible cinematography and picturesque landscapes of the Swiss Alps. From the moment the film opens, there is a tone that inspires you to look at and listen for details throughout the film. The fact that the teasers and trailers reveal very little about the plot is beneficial to the overall experience of the film. Just when you think you have the plot figured out, you will be thrown for a loop and question what you thought was predictable. In all fairness, I figured out a very important aspect to the plot midway through after a particular line delivered by one of the central characters prompted me to have one of those aha moments. However, I was still continually intrigued by the film's diegetic delivery and visual storytelling. The fact that I figured some rather crucial information did not detract from the experience. Early on, it is clear that there is something not right with the spa, and gathering information and piecing together the puzzle will draw you in closer to the film. Without giving anything away, there are definitely clues along the way that reveal the dark mystery and history behind the exclusive mountain retreat wellness institution.Dane DeHaan delivers an excellent performance as Lockhart, and provides the perfect balance of entitled Wall Street prick, detective, and humanitarian on a rescue mission. Jason Isaacs, no stranger to playing a creepy villain, delivers a disturbingly convincing performance as the strange doctor overseeing the almost clandestine treatments for an unknown sickness. Mia Goth's performance adds a great deal of uneasiness to the film by coming across as innocent, child-like, all the while hiding something creepy and peculiar about her very pretense at the facility. Bojan Bazelli's cinematography is breathtaking and is successful at completely immersing the audience into the mountain top world of the Swiss Alps. Whether following a train or an extreme close-up of the human eye (a staple in horror films), the visual art he paints with the camera serves to provide solid visual storytelling. Directing such a complex film requires great patience, organization, and effective guidance. Verbinski channels his success with The Ring (2002) by integrating some similar stylistic techniques in A Cure for Wellness. Speaking of the title itself, the irony in the title isn't realized until the third act; but, delivers an outstanding payoff that will prompt many discussions in a film studies class. Stylistically, the film sits at a crossroads between avant-garde horror and neo-noir with some science-fiction and mystery thrown in for good measure and intrigue.Despite many reviews slamming the film for a complex system of subplots and not enough traditional terror in the narrative, this film is a fine example of an outstanding vision that is seldom seen on the silver screen due to the fact that it will not likely make a lot of money, but it adds critical value to the art of motion pictures. Instead of creating a film that would have included many of the more typical tropes in this hybrid science-fiction mystery/thriller, Verbinski chooses to meticulously craft art for the screen. For the squeamish, there are definitely some scenes that will churn your stomach and even some disturbing imagery that many will like to unsee. If you enjoy avant-garde cinema or even innovative neo-noir storytelling, then you will likely enjoy this film and appreciate the vision of the director as well as the beautifully complex themes, subplots, and symbolism.Written by R.L.

159,alanpgini,"Tries to be Kubrick and fails. It's really, really bad",1,21 August 2017,"This is prettified garbage folks. Two and a half hours, for a movie with an obvious ending, that could have taken forty five minutes. There is no plot twist here, though it tries for one. Anyone who didn't know who the doctor was in this thing, is a blithering idiot. Verbinsky the director creates great shots, but if I want pretty pictures without any real substance to the story, I can get it without hoping that its going somewhere for two and a half hours. Sorry Gore, you're no Kubrick. The style clearly plagiarizes him. I'll give you a hint Gore. If you want to be Kubrick, find a good story to do it with. This is another movie about Europeans being weird, with a pathetic horror plot to emphasize it. I had to watch it through, because I was hoping against hope for redemption for the two and a half hours I wasted. I already told you how that turned out. How this thing is getting six stars is mind boggling. Its awful and not worth the watch. Its for garbage like this that critics earn their credibility.

160,Amadio,Somehow overlooked classic,9,6 June 2017,"Had I known what kind of film (gothic creep) A Cure was, I wouldn't have watched it. Had I known Gore Verbinski directed it, I'd have eagerly looked forward to it, expecting something along the lines of the Pirates of movies and Rango. Instead, I was treated to a tour de force in cinematography, superb acting, and a tense and exciting ride. A Cure is not an easy film to watch. While it is not exactly full-on horror, it certainly ratchets up the tension with music, atmosphere, and uncertainty about what is real or not. It is a long film, but I never felt it drag or that any scenes were wasted. And oh what scenes! Something as simple as a car driving up a hill - stunning reflections glimpsed on the bonnet (hood). Half-face lighting highlighting the descent in madness - or not. Gorgeous architecture contrasting with sterile settings of a sanatorium. Hardly a scene went by that was not an iconic shot. DeHaan was perfect in the role, as others have mentioned reminiscent of de Caprio in Shutter Island. He held the tension between confidence and possible insanity very well, leaving you wondering which way the film would turn. Jason Isaacs was excellent as the doctor you suspected all along, but were you right? And Mia Goth (talk about nominative determinism!) brilliant as Hannah. I can't say I 'enjoyed' A Cure, but it's been a long time since I have relished a film so much for its filmic qualities. If you just want entertainment, this probably won't be your thing. If you are into film and want something a little unusual, I highly recommend A Cure.",A Cure for Wellness
161,keyope,A real let down,3,1 June 2017,"The first act of A Cure For Wellness shows great promise. The set up and the initial premise are solid and as a viewer I had high hopes that I was going to get something unique and original. I guess you could argue that it is fairly original, but unfortunately after the first act things get weird, but not in a good way. The film becomes unsettling but also any sense of jeopardy or suspense is choked to death by the brain crushingly slow pace. Every scene is drawn out to the nth degree making the film a real tedious watch. When the 3rd act comes along I waited for a good twist and a sharp resolution, but the ending of this film has more in common with Return of the King than any John Carpenter horror. There are a few revelations some of which aren't surprising at all and others which are unexpected but just plain stupid. With a running time of almost two and a half hours this film wears your patience thin. With about 50 minutes edited out it could have been a 5 out of 10, but even then, I think a lot of people will be put off by some of the creepy elements of the film, and by creepy I mean unpleasant and pervy rather than scary. A disappointment.",A Cure for Wellness
162,achmoye,A nice aesthetic twist for Verbinski's filmography,7,23 July 2017,"A Cure for Wellness is an impressive twist from the famous director Gore Verbinski. His previous works, Pirates of Caribbean among others, are quite entertaining in their own genre, but this one is really above all his previous works from an aesthetic point of view. Most of the shots are quite geometric, and the process of creating a psychological thriller experience is really mastered, with a subtle gradation. It's all in the details. You know there is something wrong, but you don't really know what, and that is the perfect emotion to communicate for this kind of narrative. It contains some nice twists, but it's quite long though. Well it's quite contemplative, but I'm not sure if the pace is right, it looks like tension and contemplation fight each other, in a weird way. I've noted 7 instead of 8, maybe for that. Main actors are outstanding, nothing to say here. It really reminds me of Brandon Cronenberg's ""Antiviral"". Same thematic for subtle disease, thriller, and a lot of aesthetic shots. This movie can be quite disgusting sometimes, definitely 17+. Watch it if you like psychological thriller with a contemplative, photographic perspective.",A Cure for Wellness

166,plpregent,"Artificially inflated mystery, but genuine thrills and fun",7,10 April 2018,"I was certainly left with the impression that Gore Verbinski and Justin Hayte felt like kids in a candy store when they wrote A Cure for Wellness: there is no shortage of references as the film freely borrows ideas that are very typical for this type of thriller and finds a way to fit them in. I guess it would be easy to say that, many times, this melting pot of borrowed ideas and references somewhat lacks focus and ultimately results in a story that forgets many of those ideas/references as quickly as it plugged them in. While the mystery builds up quite wonderfully within the first two thirds of the runtime, I thought the last third was revealing of how artificially inflated all that mystery was, as the story settles for a conventional path. The final 20 minutes felt a bit rushed, too. That does not mean that you will be able to take your eyes off the screen until the credits start rolling, though.A Cure for Wellness is visually striking, thanks to a stellar cinematography where nothing is left to chance and a very effective direction that never pulls cheap tricks and jump scares. Despite what I mentioned earlier, the film grabs its audience's attention with plenty of eerie elements from the get-go, and successfully keeps it invested in a story punctuated with thrills, mystery and tense moments aplenty. The cast does a great job playing characters that each could have been taken from completely different films. Dane DeHaan plays a young New York yuppie that starts off as pretty despicable, but whose cleverness and stubbornness drive the unveiling of all the mystery at a right pace. Jason Isaacs and Mia Goth also stand out, with the latter bringing to life the disturbing vulnerability of her character beautifully.So, is this a case of style over substance? It might be, somewhat. However, if you are willing to be taken for an entertaining ride through beautiful and eerie set-pieces where mystery prevails, sometimes at the cost of story elements being used solely for that purpose and then being forgotten entirely, this thriller is a very worthy watch.",A Cure for Wellness

The head of the facility survived for more than 200 years and so does his daughter. When she is ripe to give birth to a child he wants to rape her in order to make a pure child. Unbelievable that someone can come up with so much nonsense and finds funds to make an awful movie out of it that lasts 146 minutes. This stupid and twisted movie is a big waste of time and if you go to the cinema for it also a big waste of money.

169,tlooknbill,Beautifully creepy vivid film noire nightmare.,9,20 February 2017,"Similar to the over the top dynamic contrast and crispy, detailed look from its director Gore Verbinski's ""Pirates Of The Caribbean"" movies ""A Cure For Wellness"" uses it to better effect in creating a hyper realistic bizarre and nightmarish feel to an old world Swiss health spa from what seems to date back to the '40's & '50's.There's also an element of old world European creepiness and atmosphere similar to the ""Taken"" and ""Hostel"" series and throw in Ken Russel's ""Liar Of The White Worm"" in that I felt I was in a dangerous, foreign world where anything could happen and the police are in on it. The brief nudity of young and old of both genders actually made this film feel I was in a more normal world.If ever there was a movie to make you want to visit the Swiss Alps it's this one. Beautifully detailed, dreamlike cinematography. Just the atmosphere and look of this film is worth the price of admission. Heck I haven't even gotten to the plot which I'm going to let other reviews explain. I still haven't figured out the connection to the eels in the water.

Films like ,A CURE FOR WELLNESS are to be cherished like a rare work of art.Yes it is highly stylized to say the least, but worth every viewing minute. There is beauty here even in it's grotesques. The photography is on par with a film few know called THE FALL. If anyone here knows or remembers Ken Russell's early films this is similar. Russell's early works suffered the same sort of reviews as this has. Today the same film's of Russell's that were crucified by critics are now thought of as masterpieces. It seems to me that the more Avant-Garde and or bizarre a film is, does not communicate well to critics.

171,ericnottelling,people should stop calling this movie weird,7,1 April 2017,"This movie is well shot, well acted and has great production value. The problem with it is the script has so many bad clichés. There are a million plot holes. There is really no original story in this whole movie. Is it watchable yes. It will actually keep your attention oddly enough. But not because it's some great movie. When I watched the movie, it was with the feeling of, I've seen this before I'm kind of bored but lets see where it goes. You could actually put the whole script together through old twilight zone and outer limits episodes plots. I have read a lot of people say this movie is ""weird."" I'm not really sure where they get that description. I think one person labeled it and it stuck. The movie itself is not ""weird."" My guess is most the reviewers using that term are young. This movie is no weirder than any other dark thriller movie. Some aspects of it are a lot like the girl with the dragon tattoo. It has some sexual content that most people simply don't know how to handle so it's just deemed ""weird."" If you think this movie is weird you most likely haven't seen a real weird movie like The Lobster or Clockwork orange. Needless to say this movie ranks very low to not at all on my weird meter and frankly is the worst description of it after having watched it.It's suppose to be a creepy suspenseful thriller.

172,ReelLifeReviews,A beautiful disaster,5,21 February 2017,"A Cure For Wellness - This movie was beautifully shot. It very well could hold up until the end of the year as my pick for best cinematography. Like Arrival from 2016, the visual style impressed in scene after scene. Unlike Arrival, however, A Cure For Wellness had little else going for it. I will say Dane DeHaan's performance was better than I expected. I'd seen him more as a poor man's Leonardo DiCaprio before this movie, but he did rather well. The first half of the movie had me bought in. The story and level of intrigue had me excited for what was to come. Things got a bit shaky after the halfway point, but I kept making excuses for the little things I wasn't liking. Then the last 20 minutes happened and I don't think anyone could make excuses for that, not even the director. As a whole, it lacked subtlety and didn't leave a whole lot to the imagination. This went for both plot points and some gruesome moments. There are inconsistencies and elements that didn't really seem to have purpose in the long run.

174,i_ianchev,Diagnosis Ambition,9,27 May 2017,"I have been waiting 3 months to watch ""A cure for wellness"". And it's been worth it...to some extend.This movie is really an original story about 3 different topics - workaholism, egocentrism and family. Interestingly enough we follow those themes in three narratives - personal, professional and historic. But before speaking about story and characters, I have to stress out how many other valuable sides this art piece has. First of all - the scenery, landscape and background of the events is majestic. The haunted spa/sanatorium among splendid nature views is the perfect set for this fantastic horror drama. Also you should know that some of the filming locations are also spooky in real life (example: Beelitz Sanatorium). Also, the music is a nice addition to the moody feeling coming from this movie. But mostly I was impressed by the cinematography. Almost every shot's perspective and angle was perfect for me. We see the story through all kinds of visual points. And it makes more involved in the film overall. Excellent positioning of the takes and precise length of each movement of the camera. This for me is very important as we tend to see it less and less in modern cinema.As for the actors and play - they were all splendid. From DeHaan's first cocky and later frantic acts to each of Volmer institute's staff members who expressed precisely the radiation of fanatic followers - it was all unexpectedly beautiful and impressive. Mia Goth and Jason Isaacs of course are the other two main characters who provide an unsettling background to our main character. As a person who has some contact with German culture, I'd like to express how on point was the feel of weird perfection coming out of this supposed sanatorium. Let's now focus on the story. I had some feedback before the movie, so I expected a turn of events more in the direction of workaholism and modern societal anxiety. But I found out the movie to influence me more on a personal level. Although the ""A cure for wellness"" focuses mainly on the fantastic history of the place and people who own it, I was touched by the concrete stand this art piece took on the influence of professional competitiveness and ambition on the personal and family life of each individual.Also I have to point out the perfect beginning scene in this film. It represents for me the whole idea behind this grinning movie. Although it's an over 2 hour long piece, to me it doesn't drag at all. I wanted to find answers all the way, all the time. Some of them were left unanswered by the end of it, but still it was a demanding and obsessive experience.So, back to the story - a corporate hunt mingles with personal tragedy and historic fantastic elements. The body horror part of this movie I leave to the fans of such things. I just wanna say that it was bloody impressive and stressful. Which is a good thing for this genre. And although the film turns to the fantastic madcap performances towards the third act, I will remember it mostly for the iconic first and second parts. The main character is an unscrupulous professional who's only family turns out to be his work. I was deeply impressed when the staff at the sanatorium asked De Haan's character for a personal contact and he referenced only his office (having lost both his father and mother). Not only that this is a great set up for his confrontation with the main villain in this story, but also connects with the audience through an subconscious level. I personally prefer to take in this film as a wink to the influence which hard work and painful ambition has on personal and family life. History knows not only real life creepy spas, but more importantly broken lives of many families. So Verbinski's goal is clear here.The movie is clearly entertaining and captivating on many levels and I truly recommend it to all drama and horror fans. But as always I try to take out as many personal and long term conclusions from a movie. And this art piece is rich with meaningful messages and great character examples. Visually stunning work which is irresistibly obsessive with its lovecraftian way of saying ""keep your mind at work, but leave your heart always at home"".",A Cure for Wellness
175,danielmartinx,Disappointing,6,1 August 2018,"I love horror and suspense, and I am in love with beautiful camera work. This film delivers a competent standard horror/thriller product, but there were so many times when I wanted more. The sanitarium in the mountains, with an evil leader who bears strange resemblance to the pieces of history that we pick up along the way, is stuffed with twists and turns that you can anticipate.The young tender girl who accompanies him to the town, for instance -- did anyone not know from the start what her character was all about?Pembroke is a broken and empty human being. What good could he do if he returned to the company in New York? He is a lost cause from the start. This is not logical.There are a dozen cliche-driven characters in this film, and I got tired of the scenes trying to create suspense by purposely dragging out the ""scary"" moments. Even the beautiful camera work got on my nerves after a while. Sure, center things and move the camera slowly forward -- do tons of reaction shots of our hero looking baffled -- return to the object, in the center of the screen again, and inch forward -- another reaction shot -- this could take up my whole life.I'm giving it six out of ten because is it competent, moderately intelligent, and the scenery and sets are beautiful.

176,targe1314,Beautifully filmed but mired in complexity and confusion,7,28 September 2017,"Very much along the lines of Shutter Island, this movie sees a coincidentally (?) very Leonardo id Caprio like protagonist end up at a creepy Austrian 'Dracula Castle' high in the Alps as he tries in vain to spring a wealthy industrialist that he needs back in New York for a critical business deal, predictably becoming trapped there himself and turned into a patient.The Cure at this wellness retreat centers around the mysterious water below the castle, that is touted as a cure all for everything bad to the well heeled elite of the world. DeHann's character Lockhart soon begins to uncover the truth is far more sinister.An excellent performance as usual is also turned in by Jason Isaacs as the creepy and intense head doctor Volmer, and Mia Goth as the only young person in the facility, the mysterious Hannah, who drifts as if in a dream from parapet to lonely parapet.The movie is exquisitely filmed. One scene, of Lockhart looking out the side of a train window and down the side of the train as it heads over a trestle and into a tunnel, is so beautifully filmed I was wishing I was at an Imax theatre. Other scenes, of the lonely castle nestled high in the Austrian Alps, are poster worthy art and incredible to enjoy.Where the movie begins to fall apart is in the writing and editing. The movie is quite long, and begins to drag. Our character flip flops between begrudging accepting patient and rebellious prison breaker. The mysteries of the strange water just seem to heap complexity upon complexity, with even parasitic eels entering the equation. Soon he is also hallucinating, and we have no idea what is real and what is half real and what is dream. Even Game of Thrones Arya style replaceable living faces are brought in, and at the end of the movie, we have no idea who truly escaped, our hapless weasel Lockhart, or the sinister deranged Volmer, wearing his face.",A Cure for Wellness

179,tfc,"I am sorry, but I do like this movie very much",9,19 July 2017,"I am sorry, but I do like this movie very much. A Cure for Wellness (2016) is one of those movies that falls into the ""either you love it or you hate it"" category. I have read several reviews that are mostly negative and the box office returns were very low which I believe is mostly undeserved because this movie is misunderstood. After watching this movie several times, I am in the ""love it"" category. Why? Because A Cure for Wellness is a very well made depressing and unsettling movie that dives deeply into the darkness and sickness that many people have within themselves and its price to be paid. This is not an entertainment movie or a shallow end of the pool movie nor does it fall into a simplistic good versus evil movie since everybody in this movie is a ""dirty shirt"". Everybody dies. No one really wins in this movie but survives. This movie is about sharks eating sharks and there are monsters that big sharks run from. For this and other depressing reasons a lot of people cannot handle this dark movie for being so mentally and morally warped on so many levels thus it is not popular nor will ever be. Gore Verbinski directed all those successful Pirates of the Caribbean movies that made good money so this is more his directorial ""art"" project and not for the mundane. Some points to look out for that made the movie better. Turn on the Descriptive Audio (DVD) that points out several important small details that most will miss in the dark lighted scenes. Notice the top notch cinematography, props, and scenery because they are beautiful and is like icing on a cake that contrasts and hides the toxic cake within. All this beauty does come at a cost. In order for the beauty to sink in and contrast the dark themes to come, some slowness occurs and some impatient people may flag this as a negative since it takes about a third of the movie to pass before the nasty bits start appearing (or disappearing >;-)). Hope you ""enjoy"" this movie as much as I do.",A Cure for Wellness
180,Chris_Ego,Shutter Island II,4,15 March 2021,"The alps, the vets, some eels and lots of insanity. Many ingredients are merged here in this boiling broth of wickedness, but the taste is stale and bitter. If the movie wanted to avoid a clear storyline, than it succeeded at being undecided.The film starts off with one of the most breathtaking heartattacks in movie history. The actor delivered an immersive performance and I could literally feel the pain these spasms might give you in the event of an emergency. After that introduction to the mad world of Wall Street there is a cynic sense of critisim to the rat race and we get some wise words about the meaning of life. Just something to ponder and that actually continues to revolve until the end of the movie. If there only was a clear clue than one could be sure that this is a socio-critical story, I would have enjoyed it thoroughly. However after 20 minutes we get nauseated while driving up the mountain and totally miss the plot line of the driver, who explains everything in detail what we need to know but it's impossible to focus on his monologue because of the stunning view, the alps and the road ahead. We arrive with mixed feelings at a sanitorium full of old folks and something is very off about this place. The fact that Hitler was treated in this building makes the whole thing more bizarre, but this of course isn't mentioned in the movie. Yet there are some eerie references to hillbilly Germans and their nazi-esque attitude, despite the film is set in modern times. The scene at the local bar makes one of the lowest ebbs in the movie. We see young Goths at a dirty hunting bar and they seem like they have been casted straightaway from a parking lot. There are some odd looks, whacky behavior and red lipstick before we can leave that awful place.While the cinematography is continuously flawless the visual presentation of the halls and rooms inside the sanitorium are one of a kind. This sadly doesn't help the infamous third act of the movie. The rocky ride of seeking the truth saved us barely from going insane, but our lead character just can't decide if he wants to dig deeper or pull more teeth out. It is very confusing to follow the revelation of the past or how it could have played out back then. Suddenly it is about the trauma of the lead character, then it is about the past of Dr. Volmer, or is it about the experiments? Eel do I know! Sadly it burned all down to the expected, but honestly not anticipated entanglement of incesticide. To make matters worse, Dr. Volmer shows his real face, hits hard and goes up in flames like a Marvel villain. Wait, what? Is this still the same movie?You see, if director Gore Verbinski intended to make us go crazy he definitely did his job well. For my taste the story needs to transform a lot smoother, with less sidelines and more clues. It is okay if a film keeps you guessing but here we have too many distractions and that is just disappointing. I don't mind the reminiscence of ""Shining"" and ""Shutter Island"", if only Dane DeHaan wouldn't look AND smile like Leonardo di Caprio. Besides this story and its details are unique but it was just executed with wasted potential.I heard Hans Zimmer had to back out so Benjamin Wallfisch took over and I have to say he did a marvellous job. The soundtrack couldn't have been better!",A Cure for Wellness
181,patomartinezfgo,The Shining and Shutter Island combined,7,18 June 2017,"I had heard some very cool things about this movie and was very excited to see it since I am a fan of thrillers and mystery movies. I was satisfied with the movie.This movie takes place in a ""wellness center"" where a lot of rich people live in to get ""cured"". The movie sets up a very interesting plot and it is very interesting to see how the main character discovers certain things as the film progresses.I must admit, it is frustrating how little information you get from the film, but that is a good thing, it keeps your curiosity high, you just know something is wrong and you don't even know if the character is crazy or some really creepy sh*t is happening.The movie is actually pretty creative and I must praise the balls it has to have certain elements of the story.The cinematography and sound design are beautiful, you can give a sh*t about the story and still watch it for its beautiful shots and the sound design.The only problems that I have with the movie is that it is way too long (2 hours and a half) and I think it could have been cut a little. Also, by the end they introduced some things that took me out of the film and were pretty weird. I must still praise it for having the balls to do it.In the end, is this as good as ""The Shining"" or ""Shutter Island""? No, it is not as good as those movies.

184,vadim-berman,There's no cure for mediocrity,4,7 July 2017,"I'll go with the negative choir here. A visually beautiful movie, if too stereotypical in portrayal of what is out of reach for an average American: Switzerland and ""corporate world"". The script, however, is a major letdown. Every single cliché is present: burned- out corporate executives questioning the meaning of life, an immortal evil aristocrat, childhood trauma (father committing suicide in front of his son), evil henchmen, local bullies (in a tiny Swiss town that looks like German-speaking Texas). All of this is tied into a stereotyped ""mystery"" with a resolution obvious halfway through the movie. Some loose ends are never handled: why did the patients attack the main character when he told them the water was making them sick? How did he survive? How did his teeth grow back? Why did the clinic insist on treating the main character, knowing that he was expected to return, let alone on a pro-bono basis (isn't there an abundance of rich patients)? Was the accident arranged with a trained deer? The script is too lazy to even look at it, let alone add believability to the little details, like the board of directors completing each other's monologues a la Greek choir. All of that is diluted with pseudo-philosophical babble about everything and nothing. Good acting, great camera work, very poor script.",A Cure for Wellness
185,hdavis-29,"""Visionary direcctor"", my a**",2,13 September 2021,"This film will be enjoyed by those who raved about Get Out, the Academy Award nominee in 2018. It is hard to imagine that the creators of that film were unaware of this one. Certainly, this has none of the PC racial elements of that hit film. But there are otherwise strong similarities in the subject matter. In both films, the hero is trapped in a perilous and crazy-making situation. He can't get anyone to take him seriously. Just when he thinks someone is on his side, they turn out to be part of the conspiracy.This is a stylish, big-budget, major studio production with some admirable and memorable moments. It also contains some of the most repugnant and extreme images to appear in a mainstream film. It is hard to take the positive features seriously without acknowledging the negative ones. These include the rape of a child (by her father) and enough animal cruelty to repulse any mainstream audience. Since the film was not made in America, there are none of those reassuring notices in the final credits telling us that the American Humane Society supervised the making of the film and no animals were harmed in its production. Nor is there any indication that these were CGI effects.Maybe the argument is that there are those among us who enjoy seeing a graphic depiction of a 12 year old girl being raped, or an animal being mutilated or struggling in agony. Don't those people deserve entertainment too? If you are persuaded by that argument, then this film needs no further justification.I'm not one of them, and the fact that the actress who portrayed the 12 year old victim was actually over 18 is little comfort. She is made up to look 12 years old, she acts 12 years old, and tells us repeatedly that she is 12 years old. This is a child rape by any reckoning. Who is its intended audience? And what are we trying to convey to them other than titillation? For those who think this is a prudish argument, why draw the line at 12? Why not an eight-year-old? How about a 4 year old? Would those even be meaningful questions to this ""visionary director""? Or to his audience?Beyond the child rape and the animal cruelty, the film does offer some stylish visual moments. They are the sole basis for the two stars in my review. I particularly enjoyed the POV shots of the train winding its way through the Alps, and the dream like sequence of dancers in Gossamer gowns. There's no denying it: there's some real visual style here and moments of Gaslight-like tension. But again, whatever moments of style or plot tension we can identify, are not justified by the horrible excess this director has showered upon us in the name of shock value. And by the way, if you've got an eel phobia, you've got one more reason to stay far away from this film.",A Cure for Wellness
186,jzathajenious,"Visually gorgeous, but a lazy screenplay holds it back from greatness.",6,5 June 2017,"Gore Verbinski has created a visually splendid thriller/horror film, which creates a wonderfully foreboding atmosphere. However, what could have been a great film is marred by a convoluted screenplay that falls to pieces in its final act, and is riddled with plot holes. I waited patiently for all the pieces of the puzzle to fall into place (and with the running time approaching 2 and a half hours, it's quite a wait), yet ultimately I was left somewhat confused and underwhelmed by how it all played out.

Everything looks very immaculate.I believe that when it comes to production this film is perfect. The tank scene is one of my favorites, gorgeous looking, suspenseful, it's just excellent filmmaking. The CGI is also incredible, does not feel like CGI at all, the eels look extremely natural. Now, the story does have quite a few flaws, when it ends, it feels like it doesn't come full circle, by that I dont mean that they should have explained everything but the ending doesn't feel fulfilling.All the movie is essentially psychological horror, but at the end it suddenly becomes fantasy horror. Some things should have been better explained/told. It would have been great to know more about the eels, they do mention them, but not much. It has some really great lines 'and it also has very cliche lines and moments. A lot of ''this place is evil'' ''there's something wrong this place'' moments that we have seen many times before.

I've seen shorter movies that seemed longer than this one did. The cinematography was absolutely stunning and everything was presented in such a green light, literally everything seemed to have green undertones, which kind of surprised me at the beginning, but seemed normal as the story progressed.

This movie had a promising premise but fail to meet the expectations. Too many plot holes, unnecessary scenes, and characters! (for example the doctor vet). The main lead actor (and others) act are crap, very rigid, with monotone voice like they only read the script without any soul in it (the only one I think to pass with the decent act is Jason Issacs as Volmer). The ML also often do stupid things to do and doesn't feel hero material at all.Last but not least, so many scenes didn't make sense! For example, how the hell Lockhart able to escape from the dentist torture (when he both his arms and legs tied strongly on a chair, with no weapon at all, and surrounded by 2-3 people), appear suddenly on the next scene without any significant damage, back to the sanatorium in one piece, everybody else just decided to forget what happened and still let him free, wandering in the Sanatorium.This movie feels like they want to put a lot of stuff and ideas, but end up poorly presented by those so many half-baked ideas. I am very much disappointed by this movie since I expect a lot from the trailer. Why I still give 4 stars for this one? It's because the cinematography was beautifully captured (even though near the end of this movie, the scene where the ML sat down on a bench with the main girl, you can see that scene had a sky that looks so fake)Overall, this movie is not worth of the time",A Cure for Wellness
192,dsalouk,"Disappointing, anticlimactic, and silly",2,23 March 2017,"A Cure for Wellness promised so much. It had an intriguing trailer and an intriguing first half. It promised to go down a similar lane to Shutter Island, where a mystery would be unfurled and explain the mysterious moments sprinkled throughout the film. However, as it becomes more absurd and more mysterious as the movie moves on, there comes a moment when realisation sinks in. Realisaiton that the story was not thought out, and it had come to an absurd turn that explains little, and attempts a feeble attempt at incestuous and immortal depth. Instead, it is a farce, riddled with silliness and questionable motives. Dane DeHaan shows poor talent in A Cure For Wellness and the character could have been more fleshed by any other actor. Jason Isaacs plays a similar role to the villain he is becoming accustomed to in OA, and the Harry Potter Franchise. Whilst he maintains a strong presence, it is becoming an eye-rolling ordeal. Gore Verbinski once made decent films, but he seems to be rolling down-hill with this tragic effort.

Immediately. The plot holes and ""stupid"" moments of this film are so numerous that I lost count and found myself enjoying it. We know the head of the institute is a mad scientist so why doesn't the hero see it? Why is the most significant room in the whole place secured with a lock that a shovel can remove in seconds? Why does the mad scientist allow the hero to wander around and get into trouble, again and again and again? Why doesn't anyone EVER investigate a Frankenstein castle-on-a-hill even as wealthy people that are sure to be missed are going there and disappearing? How does such a place exist in modern day Switzerland in the middle of one of the most busy tourist regions in the world? Wouldn't Samantha Brown and her Travel Channel camera crew have stumbled onto this place by now? If you're a hero and just escaped a madhouse, wouldn't you at least go a few villages over before trusting local law enforcement? If you're visiting someone and given a 3 page document to sign, wouldn't at least a few people bother to check out what it says before signing?Aside from the dozens of plot holes, there's the awkward perverted sexual scenes in the film sure to make audience members wince. I suppose it's like a horror version of 50 Shades of Grey where the viewer will be ashamed to admit they watched the scenes and perhaps that's part of the appeal?

Long drawn out scene in which a young girl is shown semi-naked and about to be raped by her father
Forced ingestion of eels
Dental tortureI guess the above could be argued to be important to the storyline to demonstrate the evil of the doctor, but it really was quite unpleasant.The film, though lavishly shot, relies way too heavily on plagiarism of old Hollywood classics - Dracula springs to mind, and the theme tune is almost but not quite the theme to Rosemary's Baby (the opening shot of the film, depicting the city skyline by air could almost be an update of Polanski's masterpiece)And the ending, once we've got past the Vincent Price/Masque of the Red Death pastiche, with the hero's bosses turning up en masse, is really beyond ridiculous.A lot of people on here are referring to this film as a potential cult classic, which says more about the abject state of the modern film making industry and the absolute dearth of intelligent films in the 21st Century than it does about this okay-ish piece of hokem.And one more thing, if you've got a broken leg it tends to hurt a bit, or to put it another way, YOU BLOODY WELL KNOW you've got a broken leg..",A Cure for Wellness

It is not a classical horror- movie - although the creepiness is growing every minute during the movie. It is not perfect: Some parts are a bit (too) slow-paced.

196,mark-durfor,Slow by Creepy Cringy Thriller,6,25 July 2017,"A Cure For Wellness is a psychological thriller about a remote spa in the Swiss Alps. Lockhart (Dane DeHaan) is an ambitious young executive who is tasked with retrieving Pembroke (Harry Groener) the CEO of their company from this spa. When he arrives, it looks like a mix between a luxury spa and an insane asylum. There are people doing yoga, exercising, swimming. They are normal activities done in a creepy looking facility. Lockhart meets a young woman, Hannah (Mia Goth) who asks if he's there to take the Cure. He laughs and says he's on his way out. She comments that no one ever leaves.When Lockhart arrives, he asks to see Pembroke. They are passively uncooperative at the ""spa"", but reluctantly agree to let him visit after 7pm when Pembroke's treatment is finished. Lockhart agrees to come back and as he leaves the ""spa"", his driver hits a deer and their car crashes in the woods. He awakes back at the facility and is being treated for a broken leg. They convince Lockhart to be treated by them, and he decides to turn his retrieval mission into an investigation of the strange spa that is obviously anything but normal. Other than that, you really don't get too much from the previews, no matter how many you watch. But, if you're into psychological thrillers, the images that are beautifully terrifying, classically creepy, and oddly curious make you want to see A Cure For Wellness. We saw orderlies in tight white t-shirts, white pants and white shoes conducting exercise classes and wheeling patients down long tiled corridors with flickering fluorescent lights overhead. At one point, Lockhart is submersed in a water tank with a breathing tube and is suddenly surrounded by eels. The movie itself is hard to describe. It's like Stanly Kubrik's Clockwork Orange mixed with Steven King's Misery mixed with the Saw movie franchise. A Cure For Wellness was directed by Gore Verbinksi who directed three of the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, the cartoon Rango, the failed Lone Ranger reboot, and The Ring. Verbinski is quite eclectic in his directing ventures and did a great job creating this freaky nightmare that will have you cringing in your seat at times. It looked like a strange, unsettling, bizarre, crazy, awful thriller. I gave it a 3.5 Star Prediction. I'm going to lower the rating slightly to 3 Stars. It wouldn't be a waste of money in the theatre, it's definitely money better spent as a rental, but most likely not one I'd own. Mostly, it just moves along too slowly. The movie is about 2 hours and 20 minutes long and it feels like it. The last half hour or so, really ends the movie with a bang though.

One car 'accident' later and our semi anti-hero finds himself up to the groin in plaster, dangerously crossing paths with dodgy water, dodgy Dr Jason Isaacs and an innocent young lady who may not be as youthful as she appears. What is the clinic's dark secret, and what's with those pesky jellied eels?I usually couldn't care less for the output of director Gore Verbinski (The Ring, The Mexican, Johnny Depp and the Pirates etc), but here he really does do full justice to a screenplay (written by Justin Haythe) that comes off like a timely attack on the Trumpton ethnic cleansing programme via Mario Bava's 'Baron Blood'.In fact, it's all pretty Italio horror styling crazy, seeing Bava and Dario Argento get ripped & riffed left right and centre, with an almost unwatchable Lucio Fulci inspired outing in the dentist chair thrown in for good measure. 'Ouch' is not the word I would choose to use. Where's Steve Martin when you need him?Anything for the naughty step? Well, I think a slap on the wrist may be due re the excessive running time. I certainly wasn't bored, but a good thirty of its two hours, twenty six minutes duration could easily have been shorn from the girth and not be missed. You gotta lose those pounds if you want a higher score baby.Gripe aside, 'A Cure For Wellness' is a largely successful mix of old fashioned Gothic horror & social commentary that gains virtue by not spelling it all out and not taking itself too seriously.

He soon realizes that the ""treatment"" isn't quite what he was expecting and will have to unravel an old mystery if he wishes to leave that place alive.The cinematography is stunning from the beginning, thanks to the beautiful location and the work of photography director Bojan Bazelli. The soundtrack adds to the mystery and Gothic feeling of the entire movie. The performances are excellent.Similar to Shutter Island at parts, since you won't know for sure if the main character has gone mad or not, A Cure for Wellness has the ability to please many different audiences, if you can look at it right. From one standpoint you have an enticing, suspenseful (and somewhat sickening) mystery that will leave you stuck to your chair until the very end, which will not disappoint on this front. If horror/thriller is not your thing, you can look at this movie from the philosophical perspective and try find your own answer to the questions brought up from the beginning. ""There is a sickness inside us"". Do you suffer from it? Are you one of those who build, buy, consume, and wrap themselves in the illusion of material success? Would you define achievement as being superior to other men? What is, after all, the meaning of wellness, of living well?All very interesting questions you will have the opportunity to ponder upon after watching this great movie. A Cure for Wellness hasn't gotten the credit it deserves, possibly because of its Hollywood ending. As for me, I'd certainly advise you to go watch it right now. 8/10",A Cure for Wellness
202,mauricepfeife,Unfortunately just OK...,6,7 March 2017,"(Sorry for my English) It is unfocused, messy, forced, uninteresting characters, didn't know what kind of a movie it wants to be. Added to that, it is sometimes too long, but in a way that I didn't think they could have cut something out.

203,mhiggott,Visually stunning and hugely enjoyable,8,16 September 2019,"I didn't know quite what to expect from this film, but it was a pleasure to watch. Some of the previous reviewers have given this unfairly low scores. It's not a film that everyone will love - it doesn't fit into a tight genre and maybe some people watched it expecting something else. Those criticising plot holes and characters acting illogically are, I think, missing the point. This is a film to just sit back and enjoy for what it is. The visuals are superb from start to finish. The acting is great. Jason Isaacs seems to have fun with his German accent, and ultimately it is a fun film not to be taken too seriously, that also looks superb.",A Cure for Wellness
204,johntheholder,"Supremely fake , typical example of star director making garbage just because he can.",3,15 June 2017,"A severely fake film. It's as if Verbinski is mocking us. He gets all the stylish colors and photography right , its Pirates of Caribbean photography and color job alright , it says OK "" i come from the big guys. Nevertheless the feeling never leaves you that something or possibly everything, isn't right about this film. Its too staged , it copies other films , its Shutter island and the hypnotized patients are a bad copy from the very recent masterpiece ""Get out"". But due to the masters behind the picture , the photography , you leave the damn film on ,you continue watching it. And what a terrible mistake you are making. It is a complete waste of time and a waste of good actors. I am among those who look up to the main actor , but here he gets wasted. It's also a very distasteful film that has no reason to exist and nothing to serve except to produce laughter to the director for tricking us into watching this trash. 3/10 because 3 looks worse than zero.

206,wildwitchca,Slow and dramatic build...,8,20 February 2017,The story does start slowly but that is only to build the anticipation. I can honestly say that there weren't many boring parts...it was like a puzzle being slowly built. When it came to the end...it was NOT what I expected but it all made sense!

207,MickandRorty,"""Shutter Island"" meets ""Are You Afraid of the Dark?"" meets Stephen King. Bizarre and FANTASTIC",10,20 February 2017,"I loved the movie and will buy it and re-watch it. It seems to be getting mixed reviews, but I cannot believe how poorly this performed at the box office. It had a Super Bowl advertisement that must have cost more than what this movie took in so far. I thought the lead actor was fantastic. In fact, all of the actors were fantastic. The movie is very unsettling, and I was never bored. But, then again, my girlfriend was bored. So, this isn't for everyone. It is long; but I was more than satisfied with how everything wrapped up. It is also one of those movies that really sticks with you, and you'll keep thinking about it. I thought every single actor did a fantastic job. It was such a fresh movie. One that has cult classic potential. I couldn't fault anyone for disliking this movie. But, I think there are a lot of people out there that would LOVE this movie, but will sadly never get around to watching it.I will be honest...this movie goes way off the deep end. And, you are either the type who can sit back and enjoy that sort of thing or not. I loved it. But, then again, I still love ""Are You Afraid of the Dark?""

208,screenotes,May contain traces of eel,6,11 February 2019,"It's difficult to tell whether Gore Verbinski's tongue is planted firmly in his cheek throughout A Cure For Wellness but given the film's running time of 2 hours and 26 minutes, such a feat would likely require the meddling of a twisted surgeon.The film is true to its billing as a 'Gothic' thriller with the grand architecture of an old castle come wellness centre explored inventively through myriad camera angles and stark colourisation and a forboding score endlessly permeating the halls. And this is part of the problem. So much time and effort is spent on building suspense through the technical process that the film forgets to actually further the story on several occasions. The pace becomes too ponderous to sustain any tension it manages to build.In its homage to Gothic horror A Cure For Wellness often strays into pastiche, with trope on a rope seemingly installed in every therapeutic bath. Yet if there is any wryness intended, it is submerged beneath solemn performances and a story which crawls from the sublime to the ridiculous.There should be much to like in this wildly ambitious modern take on a genre which predates film and almost every aspect of the film-making process is exquisite. Yet the film amounts to less than the sum of its parts and is ultimately a hollow experience.",A Cure for Wellness
209,banglainey,"A Cure For Insomnia, Really",4,4 September 2017,"Overall, this film started off great- I thought I was in for a good psychological thriller with some good actors and high quality cinematography. Some of the scenes were very creepy, long shots at weird angles with odd pauses, the kind that make you feel a tingle in your spine, but also have a certain artistic beauty to them.As the story went on and on, though, it became so much convoluted nonsense. It started off as one storyline, then involves some stuff from the guy's past, then involves this other storyline from the far far away past, then there' some stuff about the water, and also some stuff about some eels, and a fire, and some incest, and more and more stuff gets added into the mix. An hour and a half into the movie I was getting extremely bored, the story was going in circles, and so many extraneous story lines were added it was ridiculous. At that point, I realized I still had AN HOUR of movie left to watch.Really this movie could have been good if a good editor had hacked it to pieces. You could have made 2 separate movies from the budget and the content of this movie, there was so much story involved. You could have made one whole movie about JUST the water and it's effects and then a whole other story about the events that happened in that city in the past and then brought into the present day. And for some reason they kept involving storyline from the main character's past too, which had absolutely no relevance to the movie at all (that I could tell anyway). The movie really needed some editing, it was just too much and way too long, it got so boring toward the end, they tried to spice it up with some breasts and some incest rape but it still fell way flat.This movie was like a mixture of Shutter Island, along with an entirely separate movie about a boy struggling with the loss of his father after he begins working for his father's compancy, along with a movie about a mysterious resort in Switzerland and the water's magical properties and immortal eels, along with a story about an urban legend in a small Swiss town that turns out to be true. It was a discombobulated mess.After watching this movie, I watched another movie called Attack of the Killer Doughnuts, and THAT movie had a way better storyline than A Cure For Wellness.Oh, and the lead character was great, I dunno his name but that actor is awesome.",A Cure for Wellness
210,iamdrumil,A must watch.,7,11 February 2020,This porbably is one of the most underrated movie of the year. The reviews for this movie were quiet bad and also the movies runtime is 2 hours 29 minutes which is the reason I didn't watch this movie till 2020. But after watching this movie I feel like this was a great movie. Every shot in the movie was beautiful and even the story was great I was totally invested in the charactes and to get all the answers but the final act of this movie was just mediocre.

213,kvatter,A very slow cure,6,24 June 2017,"This horror thriller has some very good visuals, creates a eerie mood and lots of mystery but then takes forever to get to unveiling the truth behind the mystery. Dane DeHaan does an excellent job of playing a man who is questioning his own sanity while staying at a Swiss wellness center. What annoyed me was that he would slowly lose his grip on reality only to suddenly snap out of it and be sure of his own sanity, pursue truth a little further and then the cycle repeats with him losing sanity/gaining it once again... Meanwhile, the others in the sanitarium are all permanently zombified. Why is he the only one to gain clarity numerous times while none around him can? And why, if this person is such a threat to the sanitarium, would he be allowed to live, when it seems too simple to make him disappear? There are unnecessary scenes such as the female character, Mia Goth, dancing in a pub in the local village. It goes on too long and didn't serve any purpose to moving the story along. Other dialogues go on too long, as well. Trimmed down 30 minutes, this would have been a much more suspenseful thriller.

It's alright. A very 'Meh' 2.5 out of 5. Another strange film in that it starts very promisingly and very much like Shutter Island in tone and structure and propose and then (not at all) all of a sudden it doesn't really go anywhere.Borrowingly heavily from Gothic cliche's and Edgar Allen Poe the director and screenwriter set up a great story and a great world and then just get stuck in standard simple horror. Jason Isaacs turns up somewhat late to his own party, and plays a simple Gothic cross between Dracula and Doctor Frankenstein, except this time he's trying to make an elixir of immortality to make a race of genetically pure children or something, and someone slept with their sisters and the baby got thrown in a river, and something or other.It's all rather silly (again) and that's when I sort of lost interest and sneaked a peak at my watch. Dane DeHaan is excellent at playing an annoying little sh*t but because of that I just don't care if his character lives or dies, so when he starts talking to the pretty girl I just felt like shouting ""leave her alone, you're a horrible soul-less corporate bastard."" But I didn't because there were other people in the screen.There is one scene where poor old corporate bastard DeHaan is force d to ingest a whole tank of eels (literally dozens of them) but there is no indication where they go? Do they come out the other end? Does he have a VERY fast metabolism? It's very odd. and rather silly.Considering that Isaac's character has been happily killing people for 200 years the fact that they keep capturing DeHaan and then letting him go, capturing and then letting him go, torturing him and then letting him go, and then torturing him AGAIN and then letting him go seems, er, rather silly, (again) and inviting disaster!It is, however, beautifully and imaginatively shot, and the composition and framing is absolutely splendid, but all the best shots are (predictably) in the trailer, so you can just watch that if you want to see the cinematographer's showreel.The film has a very satisfactory Gothic ending (Gothic novels tend to have a sad or damned ending) and then lost their bottle and they Hollywood-ise the ending and (predictably) the boy gets the girl.This film has absolutely everything that should make it fantastic, but is just let down by a terribly predictable script and endless obvious thefts from Gothic literature without any attempt to subvert them or change them.Oh and there's loads of eels in it.

220,blatherskitenoir,Modern Gothic Tale Following Classic Conventions,6,9 March 2017,"The ominous tower with the gloomy tragic backstory, the doomed and pure maiden, the long-lost painting, the lecherous villain, and the intrepid hero who stumbles upon the truth behind the dark mystery as he bumbles around the castle...--all of these are classic elements of a Gothic novel, and A Cure for Wellness uses every trope and more to construct this singular film that will feel like a familiar friend to lovers of literature canon. If you favor slow (so very slow), gradual reveals of elaborately detailed, fairy-tale stories that unfold in expectedly unexpected ways, all told in lovely locations, you will adore this film that is flawed, but distinctive. If you thought Crimson Peak was one of the best films ever made, felt Stonehearst Asylum or The Woman in Black were inspired, or fancied yourself possessing the pretensions of an English major at any time, there is a high probability you will rave over A Cure for Wellness and think it brilliant.All others will be vaguely let down, but not quite know why. Perhaps it's the length, which drags on like they're trying to cram a TV series' worth of denouements into two and half hours, when they could have lopped 45 minutes off easily. Or the genre indecision. It isn't scary enough to be a horror film, elaborately dark and twisted enough to be noir or burton-esque, mind-screwy enough to be a psychological thriller, or technical enough to be science fiction, but is the slightly lumpy love child of all of these. Maybe it's the acting, which isn't terrible, but a bit dry toast. It's no one thing, but rather a bunch of tiny little flaws the true fan would happily overlook tallying up to equal something missing that keeps A Cure for Wellness from being a universally-great movie.Still, it's a unique movie in a sea of remade reboots and visually gorgeous, so why not give it a shot some evening when you run across it?",A Cure for Wellness

Overall good attempt by Gore Verbinski, similar to Shutter Island but not that great. Shutter Island was brilliant, but this one lacks the touch of the great Scorsese. The ending is a bit of a letdown. Dane Dehaan, Jason Isaacs & Mia Goth are excellent. The story had too many directions, sometimes looses its way, but the eerie atmosphere keeps you interested. Some shocking scenes here & there adds to the surprise factor. I have written this review after a long time because so many people saying terrible things about this movie.

228,Naive-fox,In need of a cure,4,30 July 2017,"First thing directors should ask themselves when tackling a film is what kind of film and message they're willing to deliver. Thanks to a strong start with a faithful (even if overcaricaturized) depiction of the heartless corporate world, Gore Verbinski sends a message, even a spark of hope for a witty, tense and eerie thriller. And it does keep up appearances during a well rounded first half, which could have been a complete film by itself had he wrapped it in a simple and equally elegant manner.But in a conclusion that drags on and on, Gore descends into the plainest of storytellings, turning the film into the perfect example of a B movie, filled with chliché, foreseeable events and plain characters. All the good done beforehand gets completely obscured by one of the dullest endings in recent years, leaving the viewer with a really bitter taste after well over two hours of screening.Little matters the great photography and pretty good music score and sound mixing.

230,tedd0093,A new classic to freshen up the genre.,7,14 March 2017,"I went to see this movie with hopes of great cinematography and brilliant storytelling. I would say that I'm both satisfied and unsatisfied at the same time, for the reason of both good and bad elements in the movie. The only compromise i had to make in my decision of the rating, was if the cons mattered more or less than the pros. So far I have my pros in the corner of the cinematography and breathtaking acting, during great performances by Dane DeHaan and Jason Isaacs. The story puts us right into the eyes of the well educated business man Lockhart, where Dane delivers a shockingly good presentation as a man running into a lot of trouble, having to endure blackmailing, car crash, isolation, stress, mental and physical torture, et cetera.When it comes to the cinematography it's amazing as hell, because of the beautiful lined shots for each scene perfectly blends in on the thriller genre, also the dark close ups, hidden views and alternate angles gives the movie a shiny (if not well polished) look. Coming to the cons of the film.... In the beginning of the movie we are introduced to the characters, the place and the secrets, which is perfectly constructed for the length of the movie. In the second act we see pieces of a dark puzzle starting to get some resolve, although some pieces might have to be called out in a second viewing. Towards the final we get an awesome action packed ending with the twist coming together with story-line from the beginning. Although... that is definitely not what the audience is expecting judging from the first 2 hours of the film... Which I would say is a failed misstep on the theme that the story takes so much time building up to, with a finale that would be epic in any superhero-movie, but is way too over the top and flamboyant for the theme in specifically this type of movie, which is why I must pull it down to a solid 8/10 from a could-have-been 10/10 for me otherwise.All in all still a very good movie and definitely a must watch for the psychological thriller-lovers out there.",A Cure for Wellness

234,skylerisaac,An Excellent Mystery,10,1 March 2017,"I'm going to cut right to the chase here: You NEED to see this film, and as soon as possible. Right from the first moments the film grips you in its vice and never lets go. There's a mystery at work here, and I had a lot of fun trying to figure out what was going on as the film fed me small hints here and there before finally revealing all of its secrets near the end. Now, the following sentence may contain mild spoilers, so read with caution: One aspect that I enjoyed was the fact that the film doesn't end when you would expect it to. Lesser films and lesser directors would have ended the film on a bleak note, leaving the protagonist for dead and abandoning the story. A Cure For Wellness abandons these annoying tropes and offers an extremely satisfying conclusion and wraps up all of its various threads in a neat little bow. This is a testament to the excellent writing on display. There's not a whole lot I can say about the film's plot without giving away too much, but I can say that the plot is excellent and gripping. The story may seem slightly outlandish, but it's grounded by wonderful performances by actors Dane DeHaan, Mia Goth and Jason Isaacs. It's also a real head trip at times. At times you may question whether you're witnessing a real film or just having a bizarre dream. But that's all part of the atmosphere and is definitely to the film's benefit. To be perfectly honest, and with the exception of one odd scene whose existence wasn't properly explained to my liking (Hint:Masturbation), I can't find much to complain about here. The story is top notch. The cinematography is wonderful and helps inform the films tense atmosphere. The acting is spot on in every aspect. Director Gore Verbinski has tight control on reins, and the result is nothing less than a spectacular and original piece of film. I cannot recommend this film highly enough. 10/10",A Cure for Wellness

236,Nicknielsen99,"Gorgeously done, and well written",8,17 February 2017,"As an avid movie goer, and occasional reviewer, I am one (like most) to naturally flock to the reviews of Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic, and the user flooded IMDb... Verbinksi's A Cure For Wellness strikes all categories on what a suspenseful ""thriller"" should be. I myself watch countless thrillers, as they along with horrors, are my favorite genre. Upon seeing the reviews for A Cure for Wellness, I was both disappointed and worried... I had expected a much more positive response, with not only a solid cast headlined by he greatly under- appreciated Dane DeHaan, but also a suspenseful and artistic director, in Gore Verbinksi. With that being said, this movie was phenomenal.To actually describe this movie in a flurry of words, my choice would be; eerie, suspenseful, captivating, and gorgeous. The movie itself takes place in the Swiss Alps, at a mental institution ""devoted to making you well again"", and the colors, and abilities to exploit the sound effects, score, and draw you in with rather sexual and ostentatious visuals, along with gory and disturbing ones is exquisite. DeHaan's role as Lockhart, is in my opinion, one of his best works aside from Chronicle. I personally believe he is undermined especially after a rather catastrophic blow from his depiction of Green Goblin in Spider-Man.All in all, I would give this movie an 8.7/10, being that I was drawn in, and fell in love with both the visual appeals and the stunning work on color and sound, but also the fact that both DeHaan and Isaacs made me feel as if I was a patient searching for a cure... This movie satisfied my lofty expectations, and I felt not only like my demands were met, but even exceeded. Gorgeous work and a very enjoyable movie.

238,geraldohanna,'A Cure for Wellness' Review: An ambitious take on society's health care plan.,6,20 February 2017,"An ambitious young executive is sent to retrieve his company's CEO from an idyllic but mysterious ""wellness center"" at a remote location in the Swiss Alps but soon suspects that the spa's treatments are not what they seem. This is perhaps all you need to know about ""A Cure for Wellness"", Director Gore Verbinski (""Rango"", ""The Lone Ranger"") and Screenwriter Justin Haythe, (""Snitch"") enshroud this original idea in so much secrecy, that even the marketing behind this film ask the very question we're all dying to know - What's the cure for wellness?Dane DeHaan stars as Lockhart (whose first name is never revealed) a cold and morally ambiguous character dealing with childhood trauma. Lockhart, who is insufferable to watch for a run time of 146 minutes, is meant to be unlikable to us. With each decision he makes, we take two steps back behind him knowing the lingering danger that awaits him. And to be fair, it's not like the movie doesn't attempt to warn him - On the way to the Swiss Alps, he is told by his driver the story of the ""wellness center"" and it's origins, again he is later told the same story but with a few more details sprinkled in for good measure. Verbinski and Haythe keenly leave clues within each scene for us to follow, even if it gets muddled along the way.Perhaps, this is one of the film's biggest flaws. Although handsomely made and crafted, it falters when it's time to scare or shock us. Each scene feels like a foreboding puzzle, trying to connect with very little help from its central players, leading to a third act twist that while maybe surprising, will leave others unsatisfied.The score by Benjamin Wallfisch hauntingly ushers in the ambiance of the film, with lurid and gray Cinematography thanks to Bojan Bazelli. ""A Cure for Wellness"" is not a perfect film, but it's a film you should admire and respect for what it tried to do. Verbinski and Haythe pushed limits with this story that although not entirely original (see: ""Shutter Island"" or ""The Shinning"") challenged us with a disquieting and thought-provoking story.

Great cinematography, and what seemed to be a really interesting plot (at the beginning). But somewhere near the middle it all went very, very wrong.

240,SomeGuyName,Wonderfully ridiculous,8,3 October 2017,"From the scene in the beginning with the mirrored train driving into the darkness of a tunnel, and right until the end, I was completely swayed by the visual language of this movie. I really couldn't believe the so-so ratings, but things started to get weirder and weirder, and I realized that only a particular type of movie-goer would be in on it. You really need a certain openness to experience, and I don't mean this in a ""if you are smart or dumb"" way. It's... Really out there. I won't spoil the plot, as I don't even think it's an important part of this movie. Yes, it has a twist in the end that's supposed to be shocking, but isn't, yet this never hindered my enjoyment. The music is great, the cinematography is too beautiful to not be a total distraction, and I loved the acting; it was caricatured in just the right places, helping the already surreal tone of the movie. The mystery was so original and well done, and so was the symbolism and the visual style.Did I find this movie scary? Yes, very much so, but in the psychological way. It's not really concerned with jump scares or gore, and I can't say that I've ever watched a horror movie quite like this. It has a sort of ""sensual"" creepiness to it, and it really takes advantage of the hydrotherapy part. It seems to focus on assumptions from the viewers own imagination, suggesting some body horror here, or some ghost story there - depending on who you are. It does this deliberately, and I found it quite effective. Speaking of style, people have called this style over substance, but I don't consider this movie to be empty in the slightest. Yes, it's ridiculous and not exactly subtle with about half of it's points, but it's meant to be dramatic, and it still left food for thought. Safe for the end, there was always something to take away from every scene, and I felt rewarded by analyzing and trying to figure out what was going on. Most important of all, I felt as if though there was passion behind this movie, in a way that I almost find it insulting that anyone would call it empty. I did feel a slight disappointment at the end, because this movie did stuff so that it could never be called an outright masterpiece. It's still great, though, and people who love a good psychological horror and surrealism should still give it a try. This movie loses 1.5 stars for the ending, and for the fact that I couldn't entirely suspend my disbelief as the plot progressed; it also loses half a star for being a bit slow nearing the ending. The rest of it is pure awesome.",A Cure for Wellness

242,ozyhmandias792,A creepy fairy-tale,7,8 June 2017,"I chose to watch this movie mainly because Gore Verbinski was the director and, remembering ""The Ring"", I knew it would at least be an entertaining experience. I was right. The plot is really remarkable and somehow reminded of ""Shutter Island"", an unforgettable movie of which I never thought I'd see the like again. The choice of the actors ended up being extremely adequate : I could think of no one better than Jason Isaacs for the mastermind of a diabolical institution. Furthermore, this movie made me discover two talented young actors, Dane DeHaan (whose hallucinated face I remembered from Metallica's ""Through the Never"") and the charming Mia Goth. I must admit my impression regarding ""A Cure for Wellness"" is mainly but not entirely positive. Two thirds of the movie delighted me immensely, but the final sequence felt disappointing, perhaps over the line. The final scene, as well, arises more doubts than answers on Lockhart's condition (both physical and psychic).

The mystery builds nicely: intriguing, subtle hints of the sinister slowly encroaching on the idyllic setting.I won't go into spoilers but it comes unstuck in the last, say, 1/4 when things get a bit silly. A shame, almost, that the mystery had to be revealed, because it did not really stand up to the good build-up.The lead was great - perfect for the role.

A Cure For Wellness has the great merit of being different, and to reward the movie goer with something that stands out from the crowd; but, once you have appreciated this aspect, you might also want to be rewarded with a kind of content that gives the form some substance. And here is where A Cure For Wellness lets you down. I thought the first part of the movie was very good (rating: 8): you are simply smashed by the oneiric, hypnotic power of the images, by the stunning photography, by a breathtaking use of the camera, pretty good acting; and the intrigue created by the plot is such that you just keep asking yourself where this can reasonably go. That should have been the job of the second part (rating: 2) , where instead most of the potential built in the first half is wasted: the story, from intriguing, turns silly; the mysterious plot turns into a surreal Dracula movie which just does not make justice to itself.",A Cure for Wellness

Three quarters of the movie are spent building up tension and I was personally on the very edge of my seat waiting to see where the story could possibly go.And then when it finally comes time to either explain what's been happening or leave us with a mysterious ending that'll keep us think for days the film turns into a wacky Dracula cosplay. The film initially seemed pretty grounded and that's what really makes all the odd things so chilling, the fact that you could really imagine all these things happening but then, for some reason, the film decides we need a cliché final battle with the disfigured bad guy inside his burning lair.This would've been almost acceptable had the protagonist not then run into his colleagues because they just so happen to be arriving right now.

Although not especially gory, there are some pretty nasty scenes which have earned it its 18 rating.
The pacing is a little slow, but it nevertheless builds the tension nicely and creates a sense of menace within the otherwise beautifully serene surroundings. The mystery is well wrapped up and explained in a satisfying way, although most people will have probably figured out some of it before its actually explained. Some people have taken issue with the sci fi/fantasy element of it, but I personally prefer my thrillers with a bit of the supernatural.
Be warned though-there are some unpleasant scenes involving animals suffering which are quite hard to watch, and the sexual content is quite disturbing. But I guess that's the whole point-the film intends to be dark and disturbing and it succeeds.
The only downside is that it was rather long and could have been cut down a bit.",A Cure for Wellness

It doesn't rely solely on cheap jump scares. It doesn't feel rushed. It takes its time unfolding on the screen before grabbing you and hitting you with disturbing-yet-beautiful imagery. Some have complained that the ""twist"" is easy to figure out and I guess they are right. However, I don't think that ruins the story at all.I can't wait to add this to my collection. It is a clever little movie with scenes that are quite shocking. I was a little surprised that a major studio took this and ran with it. Sadly, ""A Cure For Wellness"" flopped and was virtually ignored, but it is definitely a movie that shouldn't be missed if you're a fan of slow-burn horror.",A Cure for Wellness

254,Neil_Durrant,"Outstanding, but some wasted potential.",7,10 October 2020,"Overall an enjoyable film. Nothing was jarring or made me roll my eyes, the sets are beautiful and the acting, especially from the lead is particularly impressive, at least at the start of the film. I was definitely getting some Fight Club atmosphere from the washed out palette and the genuinely gritty acting - definitely a good way to draw the viewer in.Wellness gradually and deftly changes tone, though with slight notes of cliché, and the gothic atmosphere creeps in nicely. What I was particularly impressed with - for a horror film - is that there was not a single moment when I was thinking ""why don't they just...?"". Pretty rare to come across that.However, as the end draws near, the plot-holes and unanswered questions appear, and the film starts to feel rushed. The ""Grand Finale"" feels tacked on from another film. Also, as much as I was entertained, I wasn't remotely uncomfortable at any point, let alone scared.It feels like a poor man's Shutter Island, but if you liked that film, you will assuredly enjoy this one.",A Cure for Wellness

It has the feel of a ghost story, mystery, or creepy institutional psychological thriller. It keeps you intrigued, creeped out and entertained up to the end, but the answers never quite arrive, which is frustrating, and the ending is pretty cliche, which is a bit disappointing.Reading some of these other reviews, they mention Trump, which is odd to me. There is no reference to Trump at all throughout the movie and I never even thought of Trump while watching it. The main bad guy character doesn't look like Trump or talk/act like Trump, so don't worry about watching it if you think it's going to have some irritating Trump character in it or that it's political.

This film will leave it's audiences polarized. I, for one, was ready to call it my favorite guilty pleasure film of the year so far. The performances are enticing and mysterious; the cinematography is comparable to some of Kubrick's best; the story is reminiscent of classical gothic stories, with hints of vampirical/immortality thematics; and a darker shadow always seems to be leaking beneath the surface of everything going on. Those reasons alone, for me, account for the first 90% of this film being incredibly enjoyable. HOWEVER, a word of warning to the wise: this film had a clear ending, something cynical and dark in nature, an ending that I was rooting for... and then it continued on for another 20 minutes, and ended in a horrendous array of lunacy.

Through the use of flash backs and hallucinations, the visuals are enough to keep you both intrigued and disgusted, especially if you don't like Eels, as there are quite a few of them knocking about.
The pacing is rather slow, but this matches the tone of the film and the degradation of the protagonists mental health.

Sure, you could see the twist a mile away and the spa staff actors seem as camp and overacted as the Crazy 88 in Kill Bill... but the way this movie takes a major swing at wellness culture and gets us to truly think about the need for such unregulated practices and bogus pseudoscience is worth a few narrative flaws!!!

However, I think the setting, camera work, music and characters saved it. I liked the different visual metaphors like the lipstick scene reflecting how she ""turned into a woman"" and the cow scene.

The movie ends up being a victim of its own success, with such haunting, gripping and meticulously executed first and second acts, the final act just simply can't keep up with that level of quality and it slips into typical beats of the genre. It also starts to drag in the final act, as there are repeating themes/scenes which could have been trimmed or removed entirely.

Many reviews bash this movie on how long it is o rather how uninteresting it is. But as a film lover I think this movie is destined to become a cult classic. It has a very outlandish premise and sure the 2 hour and 26 minute run-time might be too much for some, but I felt the movie warrants that extra run-time. The plot is unveiled rather slowly and this kept me engaged through. Although the twists might be obvious for some I still believe that seeing our main character unravel the mystery is just great. The film also has great performances by all it's actors and it also contains the best camera work I've ever seen in a thriller.

281,maryleishman,There's more good about this movie than bad,4,16 February 2017,"I'm going to start off this review by saying this movie can't be as bad as anyone is saying it is. If you read a bad review, the reviewer is not taking into account the great things about this movie. For starters, the cinematography is incredible. The lighting, the coloring, the angels of the shots, its all very aesthetically pleasing. The plot is also quite good. Sure there were a few rough moments and some little plot holes, but the plot itself was creative and intriguing. This movie also did what a movie is suppose to do-- it transported the watcher. I was on the edge of my seat the whole film. I didn't want to go to the bathroom because I was so captivated. But there were some bad things about this film. For starters: the ending was confusing. I think the ending would have been significantly better if they would have actually just cut the last 20 minutes as a whole. The last 20 minutes of the movie just turned the whole movie around and I didn't like it one bit. There were also quite a few unanswered questions. This movie was creepy as hell, but a good movie all the same. I would have rated it higher if it weren't for the last 20-30 minutes of the movie, but it just became too much.

287,SickBoyGoreHound,"Decent, if a bit long, horror movie with lovecraftian elements",7,5 June 2017,"Under the surface of an half-baked attempt at social satire with glossy visuals and a taste for lynchian visions, lies what is - essentially - an old Hammer Gothic horror/drama. Verbinski tries to emulate Lynch - especially in the first half of the movie. He wishes he was Lynch: turns out he isn't. DeHaan gives his best (which is no small feat, he is a terrific actor) while the rest of the cast just stumbles behind him. There's a strong lovecraftian element: not so much in terms of Ancient Gods and Eldritch Abominations, but on the theme of human madness and the unspeakable acts perpetrated in pursuit of forbidden knowledge and unnatural power. Predictable at times and, of the - numerous - good ideas, more than a few are half-formed or not really well executed, but the movie looks good and - even if it is a bit on the long side - is perfectly enjoyable and more than worth a watch. Its worst flaws is in its attempt at being too many things at once and Verbinski trying too hard to steal from others, better, directors and movies (most notably - other than the aforementioned Lynch - Polanski and his Rosemary's Baby).",A Cure for Wellness

I am also a fan of anything to do with Insane Asylums + beautiful set designs. So when I saw the trailer for this film I thought I would love it. I did not love it. It starts out interesting but quickly just becomes a confusing mess. The plot is all over the place, and the main character becomes really annoying after a while. Plus there are some really disturbing scenes, I could barely watch some of them. The majority of the ""scare"" scenes involve these horrible Eel creatures, and its just sickening! I seriously could not get it out of my head for WEEKS after seeing the film. I even had nightmares about it, it was terrible. So please save yourself the trouble and do not bother watching this.

293,Nestor_Sanchez,A possible cult masterpiece ruined by a terrible ending,7,19 June 2017,"This movie had the potential to be a cult classic: from the opening shots you fall in love with its beautiful and captivating imagery. Some of the shots are visual masterpieces, no exaggeration. The directing, editing, acting and score are close to masterful for the first hour and complement each other in a captivating way. The pacing is slow but effective as events drag you in and take their time to be fleshed out, allowing your mind to wander around what you are experiencing.And then... After an hypnotizing hour of cinema magic where the Kubrik-esque mood and the thoughtfully crafted mystery play with your emotions, the plot starts to unfold into a mediocre Shutter Island wannabe that goes on for too long without a proper resolution. Had the movie ended in the scene where the protagonist (Lockhart) asks the little girl (Hannah) ""why would anyone want to leave?"" and leave all the questions to be answered by the viewer using all the clues hinted throughout the film, the sad and unresolved finish would have made this an instant cult classic.Instead a rushed and ridiculous, over the top ending filled of clichés was added to quickly wrap things up resulting in a frustrating experience that completely shatters what the movie conveyed until that point. I felt cheated, I felt frustrated that such an amazing work turned so quickly into a cheesy crashing b- movie (with my 1.5 hours of fascination dragged along with it). It was like watching The Shinning turn into b-rated slasher where ""the boy gets the girl and against all odds foils all evil plans"".For its visual mastery alone, it is worth a watch, and if you appreciate or love the movie bear in mind that the ending is as ridiculous and incoherent with the rest of the film as it can be and this might pull you off.",A Cure for Wellness
294,dew-37102,This movie is like a puzzle...,6,5 September 2017,"...that's missing half its pieces and makes up for it with pieces from other puzzles and at the end of your 150 minutes of labor the only image you can make out is an old man's saggy naturals.I'll elaborate.For anyone considering whether or not to watch this movie, I would say go for it; unless have an aversion to saggy naturals. You will get some unsettling imagery, some great location shots, and some decent performances. And above all, it's trying something original which I appreciate in this age of Transformers 12 and the fiftieth super hero movie that Summer. But ultimately, it fell apart a bit for me.I think the worst part about this movie for me was its repetitive and slow pacing. It basically repeats the same scene of the main character hobbling down a corridor, finding something he shouldn't have seen in an area that's completely unguarded for some reason before getting caught and then subject to some kind of horrible torture before reappearing in the next scene seemingly unscathed. It got to the point where I just stop caring about the mystery because I was so tired of watching the same sequence of events play out over and over again. I also wondered why they didn't just tie him down and never let him out or even kill him. Why play this game of cat and mouse with him? No one is going to miss him anyway.I don't want to spoil the ending except to address anyone who accuses this film of ""promoting pedophilia."" I wonder if those people think 'Saving Private Ryan' was a US military promotion or if 'Schindler's List' was Nazi propaganda because they clearly have no understanding of context. Depicting something in a movie doesn't mean you're promoting it. If a bad guy does something bad it's supposed to make you not like the bad guy. That's the only reason the scene was in the movie. Was it gratuitous? Yes. Was it trying to hard to creep you out? Open to interpretation, but I would say yes. But it is not promoting pedophilia.",A Cure for Wellness
295,Ntara-1,Breath of Fresh Air to the Horror and Psychologic Thriller Categories of Film,10,18 February 2017,"Can't believe all these bad reviews or the horrible percentage it has on this website. This movie broke all expectations I had and was filled with twists and turns that will leave your head spinning even after the film is over and it's been half a day. Before going into my review, I just want to address 3 annoying things I have seen in reviews. 1) First review I saw by Angry Joe on YouTube said that it was predictable from the first scene what would happen by the end. This is so untrue. I expected it to have some Shutter Island, Fight Club, split personality twist but that never happens. Instead you get more and more reeled into the character and all the mystery of what is happening at this facility. 2) Some critic on RT said it was a lot of unpleasantness. WHAT THE F**K did you expect? A happy go lucky movie with pleasant fun things in it? NO! Obviously the whole thing is about a guy losing his mind, so that is just in general an unpleasant theme, you moron. 3) Saw a critic saying it was over-produced. Apart from maybe one scene I can think of towards the end, it was not over produced. It was WELL produced which is very different. When I think of an over-produced movie, I think of almost every superhero movie recently that is plagued by bad writing and an overload of CG. This was nothing of the sort. Nearly every CG moment (besides the stupid face of a deer that gets hit by the car) looked stunningly realistic and was used at a moment where it was necessary to the artistic integrity of the film. This film is ART! Okay, so now that I've addressed the idiots out there, let me give you my outlook on this film. I am a huge fan of psychologic thrillers and SOME horror that is extremely outside of the box. I don't like typical slashers or ghost stories and recently have really been getting tired of the paranormal ""someone's possessed by a demon"" bulls**t that has been coming out way too often. This movie was a complete fresh breathe of air. A Cure for Wellness is nothing like Shutter Island in it's execution or style, but the main character does look like a little brother of Di Caprio and the films do share the 'crazy house' setting. This movie is brutal at certain points and hard to watch in terms of intensity, which is something I like. I suppose one thing that could upset people about this movie is that some things are not completely cleared up by the end of the movie, which leaves a lot to the imagination of the viewer. After seeing it once, I definitely feel this movie has a rewatchable factor because it seems you could dig up more, looking back through it for clues. I will certainly be buying this one when it's out on video.",A Cure for Wellness

No, IMO, it's quite the opposite, judging by Lockhart's diabolical smile as he rides off. Notice that his teeth were perfect again at that point. DeHaan should have been a bit slower in the metamorphosis of his facial expression in developing the smile at the end. It should have come off as more of a realization of what his mental state actually was.

298,andrew-marks59,A Cure for Wellness- A short review,9,2 February 2017,"Visually, this film is a masterpiece and the shots are breathtaking. The castle where most of the movie takes place is a great setting, it's a real place in Germany called Castle Hohenzollern. Every shot is a piece of art, framed and filmed with the utmost respect for the craft.The story is an interesting one, you'll be thinking to yourself for most of the movie, what is the cure for wellness? They do give an answer to it later in the movie. The plot has a man working for a big finance company out to retrieve the CEO of the company from a wellness center in the Swiss Alps. Along the way, he meets some interesting characters and tries to figure out what exactly they're trying to cure up there on the mountain.The only thing I thought the film could have done better was with the twist, it could be seen from a mile away if you were watching the previous part of the movie with even a little bit of concentrated focus.My suggestion: See it! this film is the reason people go to the movies, to be entertained to the extent of leaving a lasting impression.",A Cure for Wellness

The story did not make a lot of sense. But that happens. I watched it because of the title and the description said it was mystery/suspense. Well that part is true but there is horror also.I had run out of saved material to watch. SPOILER ALERT: there is nudity but the people involved are not good looking clothed or nude.. Neither are their characters. There is also a masturbation scene but not much is shown.Then there is a dental torture scene. I fast-forwarded that.Then there is a scene where a young girl started her period and was clueless so she showed up at a party scene with everyone staring at her bloody dress. Then she is raped by her dad. That is very explicit. And the ending did not make a lot of sense. So I did not like most of the characters or the plot. But it filled time.",A Cure for Wellness
302,ozborovac,A Cure for Insomnia,5,4 December 2017,"Original, big budget Hollywood horror films have gone the way of the dinosaurs. The old adage of throwing doo-doo at the wall and seeing what sticks, then throwing some more seems finely apt. Generally speaking, there is a deficit of cool ideas in this largely non- mainstream genre. And Gore Verbinski, the mainstream hit-maker formerly enslaved by Disney, has decided to make a stand by delivering a big- budget, wholly new horror film with all the polish expected from contemporary tent-pole filmmaking. Under normal circumstances, finding the link between tent-pole and original would be a daunting task. And while A Cure for Wellness does at times seem over-polished and clinical, could there be just enough terror here to deliver a few sleepless nights?The future of an absurdly profitable but legally spurious deal in a US financial firm is at risk, and its proprietors and head financiers scramble to try and mend the situation. The firm's CEO Pembroke (Harry Groener) is missing, having left the country on sick-leave to Switzerland and leaving only a disturbing letter in his wake. In it, he denounces the materialism and morally repugnant practices of modern life and urges his co-workers to leave him in peace. As a way of shoving the blame for the deal on Pembroke, the firm's remaining head honchos devise a plan to get him back to the States. To do this they enlist the help of one of their up-and- coming workers, the hotshot broker Lockhart (Dane DeHaan) to go and physically retrieve the errant Pembroke from Switzerland himself. Lockhart is facing legal problems of his own, and the bigwigs promise him a clean slate should he return from his quest successfully. Thus begins Lockhart's descent into the European heart of darkness. After a travelling sequence lifted straight from Dario Argento, Lockhart arrives at the picturesque spa where Pembroke is hiding. The spa itself is a gorgeous family-owned château near the base of the Swiss Alps, and it's a medicinal mecca for the richest people on the planet that need an expensive respite from their stressful lives. Rumors tell of the spa's waters contain near-mystical healing properties, and a terrifying family secret that is interred within its walls. The staff is equally mysterious, as Lockhart gets mislead multiple times. Unable to find Pembroke, he leaves the château but ends up in a car crash. A few days later, he finds himself in the very same spa with a cast on his leg and the spa's prim director Volmer (Jason Isaacs) persuades him to stay until his leg is healed. Now as one of the patients, Lockhart gains deeper insight into exactly how the spa functions, who its patients are, and what is the exact thing that it promises to cure. With only his curiosity and a pair of overly loud crutches, Lockhart starts investigating the château grounds A Cure for Wellness is something of a hybrid. On one hand, it is a fairly standard psychological thriller of the ""Am I crazy?"" variety. You know the type, the one where the main character's perception of reality is being doubted by the rest of the cast, and where even the viewer's memory and understanding is constantly being questioned. On the other hand it is a psychedelic visual journey, almost art-house in certain regards, where space perceptibly shifts in front of our eyes. Slow, tension filled shots establish an unreal atmosphere. Story-wise, these two interweave to generate the crux of the movie's dramatic tension, style wise they end up clashing far too much for comfort. While the psych thriller is par for the course when it comes to Hollywood standards with its overbearing mystery and flat dialogue, the visual journey ends up feeling like visually sumptuous, but dramatically vapid filler.This isn't saying that it's all useless, as the movie employs visual symbolism and devious horror set-pieces to a staggering degree. The way the movie implies back-story, character motivations and even foreshadowing is through the use of visual cues. Not always subtle, they become a secondary story running in parallel with the main plot. It's a shame then, that so much of it ends up being simplistic, even heavy-handed in certain parts. There are only so many times you can use water as a disturbing omen in a two hour film. Things like that can trivialise the impact of one the plot's more important beats by revealing its hand too early and too clumsily. Which is a shame, because generally the film does a good job of generating tension without resorting to jump-scares, but the overwhelming presence of slow moving scenes with long unbroken takes and very little going on gives this movie its glacial pace. And no, this doesn't make this a slow- burn kind of experience, because there is a degree of uncertainty present both in the way the plot is delivered and the contents of the plot itself. This means that the majority of the movie's horror scenes feel identical to the point of repetition, a sad fate for a genuinely good looking piece of cinema. The acting is a mixed bag; DeHaan serves more as a receptacle for all the horror scenes, and only occasionally delivers bursts of cynical anger and bitterness towards his captors. Isaacs gives a mostly passable performance. A demure, if not particularly intriguing villain, that fails to bare his teeth when the dramatic reveals related to his backstory happen. Mia Goth is the standout performance, as her portrayal of the damaged Hannah successfully infuses her character with both pathos and desperate expectation. A Cure for Wellness ends up feeling stuffy and bloated. Too much time is spent on indulgent sequences that give only the briefest of payoffs, and the story ends up feeling murky and detached in the end. With that in mind, it occasionally does intrigue and impress, but too much of it is buried underneath sheer tedium to really make this a must-watch movie.",A Cure for Wellness

Excellent use of reflection, light and angling make this an excellent bit of eye candy.The plot and twist however, can be figured out early in the first act by anyone whose ever watched a movie before. It's as if the writers sat down with copies of Shutter Island, Phantom of the Opera and China Town, stitched them together and threw a John Hughes ending in just for fun.Ultimately, there are some pretty decent plot holes, like how the protagonist is able to undo the power of the Jedi Unagi to save the day? How is the entire staff in on it? How does Unagi power actually work? How has absolutely nobody come asking about the patients there, especially the ones who've died?I've seen several positive reviewers applaud the Donald/Ivanka connection, but really the same could be said for Jessica Simpson and her dad, or that time Tom Brady open mouth kissed his son on the lips.

He has been charged with the task of returning a top level CEO (Pembroke played by Harry Groener) who has to return to New York to broker a merger.

But when they come into play they really make no sense to what is happening on screen at that moment.Its not a horrible movie, just kind of dry with a lot of jumping around from one moment to the next. At points in the movie you feel a bit confused, and with the twists and turns you begin to wonder if what is happening is a delusion or if it is some type of dream state. All in all its a good movie if you have about 2hrs to dedicate to it.

That's the thing with all art though, including great art: it can be awesome to one person and stupid to another.Though, overall, to the above average movie viewer, who also slowly becomes a critic with each movie as their knowledge base grows and taste develops, this movie is worth watching, but to call it a must see is not necessarily true, because of the few big things missing from it, things that cannot merely be identified. You know, like, when a movie just doesn't feel perfectly right the way a masterpiece like The Dark Knight feels. That movie needs no debate: the pacing never feels off, the movie is carried gracefully from scene to scene. A Cure for Wellness doesn't feel that way. At parts it feels dragging, but rightfully so for those who don't mind the wait. Patience is virtue.Basically, the whole is not greater than the sum of its parts. All the parts (cinematography and actors especially, theme, story, script, music, etc) are all superb, but something about it is just not weaves together so seamlessly like other classics. So that's the thing, this movie does not seem to be a classic, or a cult classic (since it's in the middle and cult classics have a niche/quirk/gimmick about them being classics without being masterpieces outside of their niche market, the target audience of which tends to make itself known long after research for marketing has already been done).TLDR; well for one I didn't say anything because everything's a spoiler really, even damn trailers of which movie companies have no remorse when revealing crucial information in them. Watch this movie if you got 3 hours to delve into an original, some hat stress/anxiety inducing story.

All of those things, I normally despise, and they often signify commercially expedient trash. However, slowness does not in itself equal greatness, and brooding does not necessarily equal depth. The key ingredient which has to be there is tension, whether it's a rollercoaster ride or a cerebral experience you are after, and here it was not. I was luckier than the inmates of the resort, in that I managed to find the will - which I presume we were supposed to be engrossed in discovering why they lacked the same - to check myself out. I was only half way, but this was not going to tie together in an satisfactory way, a feeling which I had from the outset on hearing the irritating 'haunting lullaby' music. As a professional musician, appreciative of many styles, I know pretentious when I hear it. 'The Ring' or 'Rosemary's Baby' this was not, those two being similar musical themes but many times weightier.",A Cure for Wellness

Too long... takes way too long for things to move around. Not for the impatientStrange ending? I noticed other people also complained about the ending, but it's up for interpretation, really.

318,shaun_couper,A fun watch with a polarizing ending,8,26 November 2020,"Real creepy throwback to horrors/thrillers of the past, although at parts, it gave off vibes of more modern films like Hostel, Overlord, Shutter Island, etc, both in the story and production. Doesn't get boring either despite being a little on the long side at 2:25. Try not to take it too seriously...the lines are slightly blurred between realism and fantasy, especially in the last stretch.Personally, I felt the ending kind of let the movie down. It wasn't bad by any means, but for me, It went from psychological horror to what I can only describe as Disney for adults. I just think I'd have prefered a darker, more gritty ending than the fairytale we got. I don't think anyone will love or hate it...you'll either like it or be a bit disappointed.Recommended, although, there's an attempted rape scene that could be pretty disturbing for some.

The last 10 minutes however 0/10!! Utterly pointless and made this film into a sci-fi when it didn't need to be.,A Cure for Wellness
322,ALB,Absurd but quite watchable,7,2 February 2017,"(I saw a preview screening of this.)Director Gore Verbinski is best known for the Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy, and also Rango, The Ring, and The Mexican, so ""quietly understated"" is not really his thing, If the Pirates movies are kind of a throwback to old Hollywood swashbucklers, this is a more lurid version of old Gothic suspense thrillers like ""Rebecca"" or ""The Island of Doctor Moreau.""The main character is Lockhart (Dane DeHaan), who is the exact sort of morally bankrupt young financial hotshot you've seen in a bunch of other movies. His bosses are so cartoonishly evil that they may as well be counting wads of cash as they tell him he's being sent off to Europe to fetch a wayward executive whose signature is needed to allow a merger to go forth so as to allow them to rake in more millions. (Oddly, a similar plot undergirds the otherwise-completely different Will Smith vehicle ""Collateral Beauty."")Most of the rest of the movie takes place in a Swiss Alps sanitarium where practically everything looks like it's from some time in the first half of the last century. I half expected John Harvey Kellogg to show up, but instead we get Volmer (Jason Isaacs), the place's director. As with the patients and the staff, there's something not quite right about the overly affable man, and the impatient Lockhart has plenty of time to figure it out after an accident delays his trip back to New York.Exactly what's going on, and why no one ever seems to leave the place, takes quite a while (almost 2.5 hours) to unspool, but Verbinski successfully distracts the viewer with visually arresting images of hallways, of peacefully exercising old people, of slithery fish, of living and maybe dead bodies in all shapes and sizes (but mostly white and old), and so on. A teen girl (aptly named Mia Goth), the only young person besides Lockhart, may hold some clues. Rather than a lush island, the sanitarium is high on a mountain, but the effect is the same, as if the viewer has been transported to a world apart.Does this all sound good? Then you'll probably like this very dark fable. The deep mystery of why the place is so strange is possibly layered with too much complication. I think everything fits together pretty well, but I'm not positive. I am positive that this is definitely going to be a lot different than anything else in the multiplex whenever you might choose to see it.",A Cure for Wellness

324,Aayushh,Not a master piece but still amazing,7,15 April 2020,"A cure for wellness directed by gore verbinski and stars dane Dehaan as a businessman who was sent to a wellness center to retrieve a business associate where he encounters different characters while finding his business associate he notices some sinister things going on behind the scenes of the wellness center, so he starts interrogating people perhaps they know something but everyone told him different versions of the same story so he goes on to find out the reality by himself. Lockhart also met a weird girl Hannah played by mia goth with whom he digged in the reality of the creepy yet scary wellness center and deals with jason isaac's character Dr. Volmer. When lockhart was young his father henry killed himself so he grew up with his mother. His father jumped off the bridge while lockhart was in the back seat of the car watching his father killing himself, he didn't wanted to end up like his weak dad which is the reason he is obsessively driven by success which distance him with his mother. Talking about the movie, not many people like it and i get this why because first thing it's run time 2hrs26mins which drags down a little and secondly it is kind of a cult classic film followed by the cults which could be the reason why the critiques are not that great for this movie. Its an original and not a remake so we should support and appreciate the fact. It is one of those movies like shutter Island, the movie does not take you the secrets itself it shows a way towards it and wants the audience to reach there by themselves which might feel incomplete to some viewer other than that directing and editing is amazing, perfect story telling and every frame is immaculate and beautiful as per the theme for which the credit goes to the brilliant D.O.P bojan bazelli who has done great job working on the visuals of the movie.",A Cure for Wellness

The plot of the movie, it fails to ever really make sense of whats going on. I kept watching for something great, amazing or surprising to happen, But....It Didn't. It was just boring.

332,heathiq,A Two Hour Cure,9,21 November 2018,"When you invest two hours into a genre known for bad effects and contrived jump scares, you expect a lot. Its effects are uncharacteristicly good and the movie is more focused on its gothic narrative than using techniques to scare the audience. Experimentation is common in horror movies but this movie chose to experiment with old thematic themes. A twisted science lead by an evil mastermind is very common in the 40s and 50s horror classics. The performances rival the traditional B flick and when you least expect the movie to continue, the story takes another dramatic turn. It's rare that plots with slimy parasites are worthy of two hours of entertainment. This movie however, has sudden twists that keep you waiting for resolutions. The movie would be a masterpiece for revitalizing an unoriginal and antiquated film genre if they had focused more on creating fluidity between scenes and between cuts. That shouldn't deter a serious film junky but it may irk those with finer cinematic tastes. Definitely worth setting aside two hours but with more fluidity it could have easily brought the two hour and twenty minute runtime down closer to a comfortable two hours.",A Cure for Wellness

There was a subtle and interesting connection in the first part of the movie, with the male nurse reading ""The Magic Mountain"" by Thomas Mann - if you read the book, you can make the connection. I think this scenario, besides the plot lines and the back story, treats subjects such as the frailty of the human being, the inability of people to part with the past or the loss of a loved one, and so on. We are also presented with the mad aspirations of two successful men - Lockhart and Volmer. Some scenes very pretty f-up... But this is actually a strong point! My advice: go watch this movie!

347,ausbt,A work of cinematic genius that gives the noun 'Movie' its Capitalization and Classicalization.,10,17 August 2017,"So much explored in the psychological hinterland of this eclectic Movie that it beggars description. I will say, however, you will be better of for having watched it. It is without a shadow of a doubt in that rare genre. It is original and yet classical and contemporary at the same time.One point on reviews: Somewhat early on - around the 'bar scene' I realized that the musical craft in this Movie is profound - Masterful, and in a sense will leave you stunned at the banality of so much cinematic musak gloss that our ears have become deadened by. My background theatrically is exactly that - Music - so I can't speak with compelling authority on the cinematic accomplishments of this Movie,but having seen it I know there are many, and many reviewers here have commented. However, I also know from experience and instinctively that the musicology employed and then ultimately delivered, made this story telling cinematic glory what it was-is. And it is simply that, that's what is so astonishing about its accomplishment, it is simply, a tale. But told in a way that delivers extraordinary contemplative satisfaction to the audience. One that will stay with you for some time.Honestly, it is Original, non-invasive and awe-inspiring at the same time. Perhaps a new bar has been set.Also, some reviewers have expressed disappointment at a sense of inertia toward the end of the Movie, however I believe this development is necessary as it underscores the terrifying human weakness before the trappings of an institutionalism that enslaves. Its pace succeeds in my view because I feel inspired, even empowered to turn away from every dark force a monstrous institution may present to me, especially marked at the end. And the argument very much ingeniously juxtaposed; the two institutions being the isolationism of the cursed village Vs the soul sucking gloom of corporate 'life'. Therefore a 'cure' for 'wellness'. A Masterpiece in my view.Aus.",A Cure for Wellness

It's frankly, a movie I'd call brilliant, in that it's almost an epic tale. There are a lot of subtleties and social commentary, which is something not often seen in a mainstream film such as this. It is due to its wide release, I believe, that it was so panned. This is a movie for smart people, with its themes of corporate corruption, breaking society's mold, the fear of winding up where one's parents did before them, and history repeating itself.

At which point they all responded with Dracula, as we were all thinking the same thing. The movie continues on to borrow more scenes from Dracula, Frankenstein, the Phantom of the Opera, and so many more less classic movies that there was a lot of - wait isn't that from? Unfortunately, it didn't even try to put those movies together in any kind of cohesive narrative, and was so predictable that you will know how it ends halfway through, but are forced to sit through another hour and 15 minutes of a clichéd dull plot that at the end if you're still awake can unsatisfyingly say to yourself I knew it.Another thing was that most of the score consisted with a song that sounded like Nat King Cole's ""Nature Boy"", so much so I could have sworn that was the music being played except with the lyrics replaced by ""lalalala"". Turns out reading the credits they didn't credit Nat King Cole's song, so it must have been a poor rendition of it. And that in a nutshell was how I explained my dislike of this movie to a friend, I told him that the movie felt just like that, a poor rendition of much better films.Don't get me wrong, I love classic horror, but this doesn't stand a candle among the movies it takes from, and bored me to tears and exhaustion.

358,goncalo-fidalgo,"Fresh, Bold And New - A Cure For Wellness Movie Review",7,27 May 2017,"""The Cure for Wellness"" or ""A Cure for Wellness"" was directed by Gore Verbinski and the ""big star"" of this film is Dane DeHaan as a young businessman who has to go to the peculiar institute to rescue a patient who once worked for the your company. Since ""The Neon Demon"" by Nicholas Winding Refn he had not seen a movie as original and different as this. It will certainly be a cult classic because most people who have seen this movie have hated it. That says a lot about the audience these days. No more intelligent films are made, they are ambitious ... Cinema is very standardized and then what is successful is ""Furious Speeds"" and superhero movies ... which I am not saying are bad but follow a Very specific and determined formula. None of this happens in ""Healing for well being"". It's a different, ambitious, risk-taking film that has a mysterious and frighteningly brilliant story and that at least me, captivated me in its 2 hours and 26 minutes. Many people have complained about its long duration. In my opinion, this is the kind of movie you love or hate, and if a viewer did not ""get in"" completely into the movie, then it will be dry and weak; Like I said ... the movie is at risk. When I mentioned that the movie was frighteningly brilliant, it's literal ... The tone of this film is cruel, overwhelming and mysterious ... but its ambitious part is that it makes it monumentally good . His Visual Part is brilliant, every frame, every scene, every dialogue exists for a reason, it's ingeniously done to deceive the viewer which brings me to the best feature this movie has: Do not believe anything you see. The movie is great at this point, very good. I will mention, the making of this film is impeccable ... almost perfect. What really can lead audiences to dislike the movie is its ""sinister"" part. Do not think I speak in blood and extreme violence, no! The film builds for 2 hours a completely hallucinated ending, which will leave almost everyone who watches the work, or terrified , or fascinated, or just angry. I think it depends on the mentality of each and the point of acceptance of each one. Personally, the ending was a bit ""too much"", the goal is to shock, with a black and horrible family history that happens in a dark institution ... but sometimes it is too ""In your face"". As was ""The Neon Demon"". But I loved this movie, it was 2 hours and 26 minutes of innovation, suspense, some terrific terror, a phenomenal performance by Dane DeHaan that manages to show all the ""pain"" of her character.

Ruins all the buildups and every interesting tension line ends up in the low-effort termination that is simply just a too stupid derogatory to the whole movie. I dont see the point in making the whole puzzle and storyline to end up this simple. I cant believe that people who made this Movie wanted to finish it like that - slapping the viewers on the cheak. The whole movie gave the feel that it differs and has some new and smart to offer but it falls into the bucket of average garbage.

Visually stunning, images that will live in the memory for some time, great editing, superb camera work, stunning scenery and background, and a plot that captivates and keeps you guessing.But what a letdown the ending was! It was like the director chickened out, and went for the boy-gets-girl, American apple pie conclusion, instead of creating a Gothic masterpiece. I would have sooner left some of the plot threads unresolved than to have inflicted on me such a silly and B-grade alternative, that ultimately left a bad taste in my mouth. If that sounds harsh, it is only because the rest of the movie was so mind-blowingly stunning, at least an 8 or 9.One reviewer called anyone who didn't like this movie a moron. We can do without patronising opinions like that. I'm not a moron, just disappointed. Go and see the movie? Yes. The visual elements are worth it.

365,mcknz20,A gripping melancholic tale,7,2 June 2017,"A Cure For Wellness (2016) is a somewhat familiar melancholic tale with scenes of intense emotion and a story as gripping as it gets. The acting by Dane Dehaan (previously known for The Amazing Spider-man and Chronicle) as Lockhart is definitely an indicator of his great acting potential in the genre and would love to see him perform more in future thrillers. Along with co-stars Jason Isaacs and Mia Goth the casting choice was great for delivering the style of film in a bleak, eerie, creep you out of your skin style. The accompanying eerie music with beautiful cinematic shots of Germany drew me into the film and the 2.5-hour running time flew by, like those cheesy time flying montages in movies where the hand rapidly spins and the seasons change outside as I was glued to the screen. I do admit that coming out of the back end of the film I did feel drained and needed some fresh air, but hey credit to Gore Verbinski for sending me on a thrilling roller-coaster ride.The film successfully provided a spine-tingling atmosphere, although, a downside is again its lengthy duration of 2.5 hours, which could have easily been shortened allowing it to be less slow in parts. It's not a masterpiece, to say the least, but it is definitely a great addition to the genre and I would definitely like to see more thriller/horror directed by Gore Verbinski in future films as his artistic vision is what makes his films what they are. So go check out A Cure For Wellness (2016) you won't be disappointed! -Mackenzie 8/10",A Cure for Wellness

They say it misses originality, I say it is an idea, a new one, a mix of Nazi/Alchemy/critic to modern society and so on. Photography literally amazing, as it is set in a magic place, up to Swiss mountains. The actors are playing their role perfectly. Villains and protagonist, everyone is giving something more to this movie. Really, suggested.

371,caitlinjeangames,It's something else,9,25 January 2019,"What I really enjoyed about this movie was the atmosphere and the visuals. The story itself is..something unique. When I first watched the trailer I noticed it was really vague, but the chilling music and scenery pulled me in. After renting it on blue ray, I was pulled into a 2hour and 30min adventure of a man unraveling a dark secret that plagues a ""wellness"" center in the mountains of Germany. The movie is on the longer side, but in my opinion that just makes the story itself seem more realistic. The creator of A Cure for Wellness was brave for trying something this unique, and honestly this kind of movie, while different, doesn't deserve the low ratings I've been seeing. I think, just like the movie, you have to be a certain kind of person to enjoy it. If you are looking for a suspenseful, mysterious, and dark movie to watch, this IS it.

382,julius-kuegel,"Overlooked, underrated, and misunderstood",8,18 August 2020,"The utter ridiculousness of some reviews here got me writing my own, which i rarely do.I remembered seeing trailers for this back when it came out, and being quite intrigued. For some reasons i didn't watch it back then. It recently came back to my mind and i decided to look at some reviews before giving it a watch, just to adjust my expectation. Reviews were quite mixed, but that doesn't mean anything, a lot of good movies divide audiences. Then i looked at the actual content of those ""critiques"". Almost every single bad one mentioned Trump and Ivanka for some reason, and they never actually talked about the film. All of this seemed quite fishy to me, so i decided to give it a watch.The best i can describe this movie without giving spoilers is ""an A24 movie with a Hollywood budget"". I haven't seen this kind of film from the so-called dream factory in a long time, and i thought i never would again. It's well-paced, atmospheric, and absolutely GORGEOUSLY shot.
As for the Trump comparisons, they are so forced its honestly insulting to the movie. My only explanation is that this movie came out when the incest rumors were going around, and of course people were still in such a frenzy that they drew connections where there are none. All i need to give as proof is that this movie was written and filmed before Trump was even elected, nevermind considered a serious candidate. It's honestly sad to see people rip on a decent movie because of a delusion (and quite ironic considering the subject matter).In short: This is a psychological thriller about the sickness of our modern day materialism, the stress and dissatisfaction that comes with it, and the quacks who exploit it. This is better than the reviews make it out to be, it's not a masterpiece, but definetly above average. Also it's one of the few recent Hollywood thriller/horror movies that isn't a reboot, sequel, or based on a comicbook, and God knows how long we'll have to wait to see another one of those.",A Cure for Wellness
383,sLnThePerFecT,Simply awful.. Avoid at all costs!,2,15 June 2017,"I had to write this review. I have no idea why that there is so many good reviews on this p.o.s. I just finished watching this 'movie' and it was plain awful. The first half of the film was okay but the second half was a disaster. I just kept waiting for 'the big break' but that never happened, at least not for me. I guessed all of the 'big news' before they have happened because it was so obvious that even a retarded person would see it right through. When i first saw the bad guy, i knew he was the original German dude, i guessed right away that the girl was his daughter or his wife. And the more obvious of all was THE WATER! Everyone drank lots of water but not the bad guy and NO ONE has the common sense to ask 'Why is that?' But our 'good' guy was so slow in head that he finally understood that the water was the 'cure' but almost at the end of the movie after they have insisted him to drink lots of lots of it and after seeing the cow with the eels on it's guts for drinking the very same water! Bu he never questioned it our good boy, not once. And that's not all. He walked really fast for a guy that has a broken leg. He never tried to escape. HE lived after almost 10 pounds of 'eel' (?) had been gushed down in his throat and became a different person after! And for the love of god, what was up with all of the nudity and +18 stuff?! Were all of those scenes necessary? I mean did we have to see a girl who got her first p. to get married to her father and then get molested by the very same man for minutes? The nurse scenes and the naked old ladies and guys stuff, i mean came on... And at the top of that, we still don't know what really happened. The bad guy had a false face because of the burns from 200 years ago and he just simply peeled his face of and got burn again and just walked right out of the fires and all of this was because of some kind of fish and water? Briefly, the script was stupid and easily predictable, the acting was meh. So at the end of the film you're either gonna laugh or be angry that you have watched it. I laughed.",A Cure for Wellness

However,not enough was explained at the movie's conclusion and you were left with way too many unanswered questions! I am left longing for a complete explanation of the story line! A much needed and decent synopsis would be great at this point. I really did enjoy Dane De Haan's powerful performance. I was not familiar with him or any of the other actors before this film.

My boyfriend and I are huge horror fans and our scare tolerance is pretty high. But A Cure for Wellness surpassed my expectations by far. I don't want to build this up too much, but it is definitely worth seeing.This film is quite unique. It taps into several different types of fear-- claustrophobia, drowning, entrapment, and I could go on. So if you don't find one thing particularly scary, there will be something else that will strike a cord with you. I almost don't like using the word ""scary"" to describe this movie. It was more disturbing than anything-- visually disturbing at times. There is one scene that made me physically sick to the point that I felt I needed to leave-- not everyone is going to react that way to the scene, but it hit some deep seeded fear within me. If you are looking for jump scares, this isn't it.The reason I didn't give it a 10 is because there are a few elements of the plot that are predictable. I suggest that you fight the urge to try and figure things out and just enjoy it. Also, it seemed a little long. There were scenes that could've been shortened or even cut.Despite those minor things, this movie was truly suspenseful.

It is a weirdly claustrophobic conspiracy horror movie. It could have been crispier; the lack of focus attenuates the awesome eerie atmosphere created. The movie is a little too long and story falls a bit short making one think how extraordinary it could have been. Choreography is noteworthy and has shades of Kubrick making it weirdly impressive and artistic. Color combination has been used expertly to support the visual eerie tone of the movie. Dane DeHaan perfectly fits the character and does quite a good job. Jason Isaacs if OK as Dr Heinrich Volmer and Mia Goth is suitably dreamy and unearthly as Hannah. The best part of the movie is its ability to create a good old weird psychological atmosphere; liked it. What is not to like is that the movie extends a bit too much due to lack of focus and pace.

392,pocketpreach,What happened?,3,25 March 2018,"Beginning this movie I was sucked in and intrigued. Well filmed with stunning visuals and a very creepy feel, this long film kept my attention all the way through. That being said, I would liken it to buying a brand new puzzle, arranging and sorting the pieces for two hours only to find that none of them fit together. The jumbled pieces truly are random and there never was a larger picture to piece together. The film gives you puzzle pieces all the way through. The watcher understands a scene is a hallucination. You speculate a character may or may not be real. You wonder who is sane and who is not, and you hope and trust that the clues you are given will lead you somewhere, but to everyone's surprise, they don't. There is no great conclusion or answered question. Instead the movie takes a hard turn with a b-movie monster feel and one has to wonder if the writers gave up. I felt it was a waste. Everything seemed good, but I wanted something clever to wrap it all up. My conclusion: watch ""shutter island"" instead. It has a similar feel but will satisfy you with a well thought out and clever ending in a way ""a cure for wellness"" never will.",A Cure for Wellness
393,nathaliehrivnak,They don't make movies like this anymore,8,28 March 2017,"As an avid movie lover, watching A Cure for Wellness made me feel at ease. From the very opening credits until the fist-clenching finale, I was hooked. And despite having heard a lot of reviewers complain about the length of the film, I didn't care, I didn't mind at all. In fact, I was prepared to watch more. Even though there are apparent parallels to other thrillers (Shutter Island and The Shining being the most obvious ones), I couldn't help but appreciate the fact that this movie was original. In a movie world that is currently predominated by reboots, remakes, prequels and sequels, watching a movie that is based on an original (and quite honestly, downright bats*** crazy) script, felt very refreshing. But mere originality doesn't make for a good film. What will strike people most about this movie is also its biggest quality: its visuals. Ever since Refn's The Neon Demon, the bar was set extremely high. And A Cure for Wellness comes very, very close to Refn's visual masterpiece. Every shot in A Cure for Wellness is meticulously framed, the setting is lush and gorgeous. This film is undoubtedly beautiful. Verbinski's attention to detail and immaculate vision elevate this movie from good to great. This is also not just style over substance. This is a tension-filled, claustrophobic, enthralling hell-ride we get to experience with the, at times quite unlikable, protagonist who, the more he wants to escape, the more he gets trapped in the for walls of this eerie (understatement) spa retreat. This movie keeps you on your toes and, despite its hefty run- time, managed to surprise with its twists and turns. Another aspect that boosts this movie is its performances. An incredibly under-appreciated Dane DeHaan gives one of, if not his best performance as an initially unappealing business man who doesn't seem to care much about anything other than his job. Yet his eagerness and ambition make for a compelling protagonist. DeHaan has to carry this weighty movie on his shoulders and he does it masterfully. Jason Isaacs as head of the facility gives an ambiguous and sinister performance. This role seemed to be tailor-made for him. And last but not least, Mia Goth, whose looks alone contributed massively to the mood of the film. Her downright child-like performance felt incredibly natural and organic. The reason I'm not giving it a 10/10 rating is the ending, which has been bashed across the board for being to Hollywood-esque, too over the top, almost as if it didn't quite fit the tone of the movie and I do have to agree to a certain extent. Without giving too much away, the purpose of the ending was to shock. And unfortunately, it backfired. I expected more from a film that set itself up to be more than just a standard thriller and failed to accomplish its goal to fully deliver. Nevertheless, A Cure for Wellness is my favorite movie of 2017 so far. It is vicious, evil, odd, original, tense and uncomfortable. Unlike anything I've ever seen. And that is as much high praise as it is a triumph for film.",A Cure for Wellness
394,captianfunducker,"Standard, but expertly shot and well-crafted",8,9 June 2017,"I'm honestly surprised at the amount of backlash this movie received when it was released, since I not only like it but I found fairly run-of-the-mill in a lot of ways. There's not a whole lot I can say on the story, other than it feels like a very long extended Tales From The Crypt episode (but a good one). Most people (including myself) connected with the visuals the most, and I would say they are a strong point for Gore Verbinski. The kind of sickly green color scheme, along with the wonderful castle set and a few standout artful shots definitely put the visuals at the forefront. My only real complaint would be the length, as even though not a lot of time is wasted plot-wise, a 2 1/2 hour run-time is ridiculous for this kind of story, which could have easily been told in an hour an a half. Maybe we wouldn't have connected with Dane's character, but I think in general it could have been just as effective without submitting the viewer to this. Otherwise, I highly recommend it, and in terms of horror movies I hope this trend of artfully shot films continues in the genre.",A Cure for Wellness
395,mistermoviereview,A Cure for Wellness (2016) - Mister Movie,6,8 September 2017,"By simply reading the plot synopsis, you can already know what you type of movie you are about to watch and it is more or less what you were expecting.The film takes you to a place you would like to visit without visiting, instead it throws the burden on Lockhart (DeHaan), who arrives at a wellness center with a simple task at hand. An unfortunate event delays his stay and he is forced to spend more time inside the walls of this eerie location. What follows from there is a mystery at heart as Lockhart travels down a path (or hallways in this case) learning new things about this place, the staff, and the patients.The movie itself is a fun yet somewhat slow ride though the pacing doesn't stand out is a real issue since, along with Lockhart, you are thirsty for answers to the questions that the film raises and for this reason you are willing to wait.With convincing acting from the main cast all around, you might sometimes question a couple of decisions that Lockhart makes, but you can have an understanding of why he makes these decisions since the movie builds his character this way and given the situation he is in.Where the movie fumbles a little is the ending, it feels like the conclusion of a different movie, not the one you have been following for the last two or so hours.To end this review, the movie is a mystery and is a well handled one thanks to the great acting, storytelling, and directing.

My friend decided to the rent the movie for us and she quickly regretted it. Whilst watching the movie, you struggle keeping up with it's extremely painfully slow pace. You kind of keep waiting for something to happen, but at the same time you know there is no way to make this movie actually decent.

By the way the staging was astonishing and the camera work was also kind of interesting.But for a great movie you also need a great story at first and that was one of the problems which I had with this movie:It was a predictable story and the last 40 minutes were way too long.

408,fokkusu1991,"Refreshingly different from Hollywood's slew of reboots and sequels, but not for those who only like traditional plot structures",9,19 February 2017,"Finally, a big-budget movie that isn't a reboot or a sequel and does something interesting.I'll say this up front: If you can only appreciate traditional plot structures, this isn't the movie for you. Most of the negative reviews I've seen complain about the plot being confusing or too complicated. ""A Cure for Wellness"" is incredibly surreal in both imagery and plot, ergo not everything is going to make complete sense. Personally, I find this to be the best aspect of the film. Traditional plot structures where everything is simple and spoon-fed to the audience are fine, but they've been done over and over and aren't challenging and offer little to mull over. The occasionally nonsensical plot turns of ""A Cure for Wellness"" also reinforce the idea that the main character is slowly losing his mind - After all, this takes place in a sanitarium.The visual style for this movie is fantastic. There's a lot of muted yellows, greens, and blues, and the setting of the sanitarium feels at once overly sanitized yet decaying. The horror in this film doesn't come from jump scares or gore, but rather a building sense of dread and some truly shocking scenes* of what some humans are willing to do to other humans in the name of the eternally elusive goal of ""purity.""And that goal is the drive behind the heinous acts committed in this movie, as well as some of the most heinous acts ever committed in the real world. ""A Cure for Wellness"" presents interesting, albeit disturbing questions: Is the drive for purity worthwhile with the paradoxically high cost of human lives? How do we define purity and perfection? In the search for increasingly lofty standards of perfection, do we risk losing what ultimately makes us human?My only complaint is the abruptness of the ending. After the big reveal, the film rush to the ending at a breakneck pace which broke from the mood of the rest of the movie. It shook me out of the experience a little. However, I can overlook this, since this is the first big-budget movie I've seen in years (yes, years) that broke from the modern Hollywood mold and had me completely engaged in what was on the screen. *Please find a sitter for your kids; don't take them to see this.

410,naten530-712-525381,"An interesting visceral experience, but that's about it",5,20 July 2017,"I have mixed feelings about this film as the previews gave me high hopes that this would be a refreshing horror mystery experience that stands out from the majority of today's mainstream muck. this film gets most of its oomph from the cinematography, on screen imagery, and general oddity leaving you thirsting for more around every scene. The protagonist seems very similar to Leonardo DiCaprio's character in Shutter Island, having a damaged unresolved past and living a life of constant consumerism to escape said past. However, you are ultimately left thirsty as the plot never really comes through in the end. The predicament the protagonist is involved in which is the sole reason of him going to the resort to retrieve the CEO is never really explained. The Doctor Who runs all the experiments never really fully divulges what the benefits or significance of the eels are. He keeps his daughter there but for what reason exactly is never revealed. I was holding my breath to the end for the climax of all this visceral mystery and was left under whelmed and let down. This is a film you really only see once late at night when you are in a weird mood and want to see some disturbing imagery but don't expect much more from that.

The meaning we give to malaise, created for the sole purpose of being cured.
There are inconsistencies about freedom, the protagonist could have objectively escaped several times, but he did not. Why? Because curiosity kills the cat.
The search for the long-lived elixir, it is deduced that the elixir is obtained from life, and who owns more? Rich people, or rather, greedy. Is greed the elixir of long life?
Why do you want to keep the baroness alive? Why would the greedy want a girl with no willpower to pass on her genes to the future? Is Hannah the symbol of feminine puberty and emancipation?
Why do eels live 300 years?

Everything is thought through, and even though it is long, everything comes together in the end, and it is worth the watch.

Not everyone is going to like it, nor try to understand it, but it leaves a certain impression that you can't quite forget.

The people in charge try to convince him that he is a patient, but he sees through their sham. And strangely, his biggest ailment is dehydration in spite of all the water he is consuming. It becomes apparent that this place is run by vampires, and the biggest shock is that they turn out to be reptilian. In the end, he realizes that these monsters are no threat to him, since he possesses all the same powers as them. And runs off with the girl. Good story. Accurate depiction of real life.

436,thomasfcook,What the movie owes to The Magic Mountain,7,21 February 2017,"I haven't seen anyone write about this yet, but the movie is based, at least to a degree, on the novel ""The Magic Mountain"" by Thomas Mann. In fact, one of the attendants is seen reading the book (in German). The novel concerns a young man who goes to visit a cousin who has tuberculosis and is staying at a sanatorium in Davos. But instead of staying a few days he ends up staying seven years because the doctor there diagnoses him as having a bit of tuberculosis himself. The people in the sanatorium are wealthy, bourgeois, and they eat lavish meals at night, while take their treatment in the daytime. The treatment mainly consists of lying down on cots on a balcony, breathing in the frigid air while swaddled in warm blankets. The novel is hard to interpret, but is felt to be a depiction of competing ideas in Europe in the run up to the first world war. There was nothing more strange to the people that lived through those times, than the sudden change from a Europe at peace to a Europe at war in the space of about a week. I was hoping the movie would give us a new look at the novel, and initially at the start of the movie when the creepy board of directors gives Lockhart his instructions, I thought it might be. But I don't think it did and I don't think that was the director's intent. However, it was eerie and beautiful to look at. Horrifying sometimes, but not scary. It managed to create a sense of dread which I think is hard feeling to evoke. Dane DeHaan, as usual, was wonderful.",A Cure for Wellness

First of all i would like to talk about the story: In the first half of the movie i was getting ""Shutter Island"" vibes because its really similar with the setup. The story is not that complex at first but when we dwell deeper into the movie it gets more and more mind blowing so you have to think and use your brain to enjoy the movie to the fullest. And oh boy this movie will sure play with your brain a lot. We can also see some psychological things in the movie like the development of the characters etc.Second i would like to talk about the soundtrack: The soundtrack is made mainly by Benjamin Wallfisch an English Composer and i must say that he did an amazing job with the soundtrack. It was very pleasing combined with scenes outside the SPA with the shot of the Swiss Alps. But that's not all of it .. the dark and mysterious scenes inside the SPA combined with the music gave me goosebumps.The next thing i would like to talk about are the Characters: I must say I'm somehow disappointed ... i tough the main villain would be a psycho from the start but he was just a chill guy who remained calm the whole time until the end but otherwise the main hero Lockhart was done right and played right the actor did the role really well.And at the end the visuals: The Visuals were done god damn GOOD! it was stunning to watch my eyes were crying from such beauty.

I know, the whole production is 2 hours and 20 minutes, but believe me you want take your eyes off of the screen.Very good acting, a few moments which put you in between your own sanity and logical explanation, the thin line between a horror and a thriller, major plot twists and scenes questioning your own understanding of life, add just a few fine touches to the composition like a fine brush to a good painting.Yes, the film is provocative, but that's why it is R-rated. It is your choice whether you should go see it or not. One think is for sure, you haven't watched anything like it in the nearest 5-6 years.If Transformers has an average score of 7.1, I think that this film deserves at least 7.5.",A Cure for Wellness

The ballroom scene was so hypnotic to watch. The acting from Dane Dehaan was phenomenal and I think he is very much going to be one to look out for in the future.However, I believe the story was incredibly weak. What started off as a promising concept so quickly went off the rails and the ending was merely thrown in for shock factor which wasn't needed. While the ending did throw me off, it was not in a good way more like 'Wow, that's really all they could think of' which was disappointing. The film easily could have finished with a somewhat satisfying ending 30 minutes earlier but it just dragged on.Only go see it if you appreciate good acting and cinematography, but if you're looking for a shocking and creepy story then the Haunted Mansion is probably a better film.",A Cure for Wellness

Middle and end (1/10)
It's consistent... thats the only thing I can say. Foreshadowing for all twists is painfully obvious. Its more like neon signs saying LOOK AT THIS BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT !!! Some of them were so useless and gave nothing to the story it just collapsed on itself. So drawn out when the story is for an hour max.

But that's not the problem I have because the Alps don't look too differently in the two countries. Except that the Swiss mountains are much higher and nicer... But when you hear the natives speak, they talk German with each other like it is talked in Germany. The Swiss-German dialect is completely different! From Switzerland we only see the money notes and car signs. So why don't they set the film in Germany in the first place?

467,ambitionz,It is legitimately better than the rating...,9,14 October 2017,"I'll never understand why some movies end up rated the way they are. This is one of those movies. It's not groundbreaking. It's not mind blowing. But it is a great example of what a quality movie is. The acting is good to excellent. The cinematography and visuals are exceptional. The story is a little odd, but so what? Since when does a movie plot have to be within the realm of ""Normal""? It is what it is, and this one actually all comes together relatively well. The pacing, although a long movie, is actually pretty good. You'd think 2-1/2 hours is too long. After watching this movie, I'd have to disagree considering the fact that everything that happened contributes to the story and slowly builds suspense. I can see why some people don't like that, but it's unfair to rate a movie poorly simply because you don't like the style. It's not a frantic seat-of-your-pants thriller horror movie. Why do people insist on rating movies how they think they ought to be, or how they thought it was going to be, and not simply how it is?I sit here and can't help but think I might be completely crazy. I just finished watching ""Transformers: The Last Knight"" before this movie. That movie was incredibly bad. I mean, literally the only thing going for it was special effects and, a few of dozens of attempts at humor that were actually funny. How on Earth is the aggregate user score only 1 point lower than this movie? That blows my mind. Or how about ""Get Out""? I liked that one too, but I cannot fathom how it's better than this movie in any way! They are both ""it's not what it seems"" type thrillers. Is it because of the racial element or something? I'm sorry folks, but ""A Cure for Wellness"" is a far better movie in every way. I implore you to watch this one if you enjoy ""it's not what it seems"" type movies. I can't remember enjoying one like this since ""shutter Island"" with Leonardo DiCaprio. Don't believe the 1/10 reviews on this. It's a shame people have to be so shallow and misuse the rating system. If people rate this movie anything less than 6/10, it's because they have no idea how to judge elements of a film. The only legitimate gripes about this one are the length and the slightly bizarre plot. But those are elements that worked for it IMO. After using IMDb for years to get my reviews, I just now decided to make an account. Because I can't stand seeing a very good movie like this rated so low. It's a 8.5/10 movie and nothing about it is bad at all. You may not like it, but you can at least try to be objective about it and give it a rating it deserves... I mean, come on people. Captain America is 8/10 and this is 6/10!? Give me a break...",A Cure for Wellness

Only slight downside for me - maybe a little too weird in places. But this does add to the mystery. It also leaves a lasting impression when the movie has finished. I found myself putting pieces together trying to make sense of it all. But again, for me, this is what I want from this type of film. it is competently original and nothing like any other film I've seen before. The only film it does have similarities to is shutter island. Which of course, is an incredible film. I do believe that if Di Caprio played the lead role in this film ratings would have been much much higher. But that isn't me discrediting Dane DeHaan, he plays the role very well.

474,caitlinrepp-94206,future cult status for sure (possible spoilers? I don't know-- just to be safe),8,28 February 2017,"Now, I obviously walked into a Cure for Wellness expecting to a be at least a little disappointed. Although Gore Verbinski has impressive list of directing credits (Pirates of the Caribbean, The Ring, Rango), Dane Dehaan is one of my all-time favorite actors, and the cinematographer deserves an award for the work he did for this movie, something about it just didn't work out. I mean almost nothing worked in Suicide Squad and they still managed to get an Oscar nod. When the movie starts, it opens on an eerie and refreshingly Gothic lullaby, echoing through the theater. Immediately, I was impressed by the camera-work. Within the first fifteen seconds, I was physically drawing back in amazement. This kind of camera-work is something you almost never see in modern horror movies (usually in horror films there's only one or two creative shots that I can drool over). Some of the shots were obviously pulled right out of movies like the Shining and Clockwork Orange, which you can see in the preview. It didn't feel like stealing though, it was paying homage. The soundtrack was very impressive, even if half of it was Gothic lullabies and half of it was 80s slasher movie music. Dane Dehaan's character was not really complex as he mostly served as a victim. They tried to add in some back story about his character, but while I was impressed by this movies ability to follow the first rule of film making (show-- don't tell), the backstory was barely touched on and seemed kind of unnecessary. I agree with most of the critics when they say a good 40 minutes could've been cut out of that movie and I think all of those minutes have to do with Dehaan's character's backstory. They never gave any sort of conclusion on that or told us why it was in the film. This being said, Dane Dehaan plays a good victim. He also has this ability to switch between a smug, greasy stockbroker to a brooding Noir film lead in just a moment's notice, but that's not really anything to write home about as, of course, Leo Dicaprio has been doing the exact same thing for a while. There's something different about Dehaan though. Maybe I'm biased because I've been watching his movies since day one, but if there's one thing he's good at, it's taking a few fake hits on camera and looking like he actually took them hard. The main girl in this movie was played by Mia Goth. She doesn't have really any credits in film (from what I remember), but I really liked her and I hope to see her in more movies. I don't really know much about her, except that she dated Shia Labeouf at one point. Her character was probably the most interesting character in the movie. I won't tell you why, even though the twist at the end of this movie is really obvious, so I guess you'll have to see for yourself.That brings me to my next point-- the plot. It kind of reminded me of 10 Cloverfield Lane in the sense that it was really really good and tense and interesting up until the end and then it was really bad. The twist at the end wasn't even really a twist, but I can see where the writers were going with it. See, there's a little thing called dramatic irony, and if you don't know what that is, it's when the audience knows the big secret, but the character's don't. And I feel like this is what the writers were going for as this movie was taking a little bit from the Gothic genre. Also, part of the twist involves some computer- made special effects that were totally unnecessary and took away from any shock value they had left. I also just wanna add in that it seemed like the director and writers had a lot of creative control with this movie and I appreciated that a lot, but it just didn't work.Some of the scenes were a little weird and out of place, but I can't tell if that's a good thing or bad thing, I'll have to get back to guys on that one. You'll probably know what I'm talking about when you see it (if you see it). Some of the special effects really took away from the shock value of this movie too, as some of them were so cheap and obvious. All the practical effects looked okay-- good enough. I wish they would've stuck with practical effects. This movie gave off a bit of a B-movie vibe, as I said it reminded me of some of Stanley Kubrick's more corny classic movies. So, it would've actually been nice to maybe see something like stop motion in this movie, or just more practical effects.All in all, I think I would feel comfortable recommending this movie to you guys, as long as you're aware that some of it is bad, but it really doesn't get bad until the very end.(I wrote this review after the first time I saw it, and after seeing it a second time, I have to say that some of the bad scenes really grew on me, so this movie takes some warming up to. Also, seeing it a second time has explained some of the things I didn't understand the first time I watched it, but I don't know how many of you will want to see it two times.)",A Cure for Wellness

There is also a scene that associates with the Illuminati ritual. The baron symbolizes the powerful families who manage whole economy around the world.

484,cwhasset,"Draws you in for ~ 1 hr 45 minutes, then collapses",3,22 December 2017,"In the end, this movie was a real disappointment. It was really, really good for the first 90+ minutes, to the point where I didn't want to stop watching because I really wanted to know what the deal was with the place. Basic idea: A young financial hotshot - Lambert - travels to a health sanitarium in the Swiss alps to retrieve a senior partner at his firm who seems to have gotten stuck there. A merger of their financial firm is about the happen, and the senior partner absolutely, positively must be brought back to New York, pronto. Lambert arrives at the lovely but slightly eerie sanitarium, and the viewer quickly gets the sense of something terrible is happening there. But what? The partner (Pembroke) doesn't want to leave (""Why would anyone want to leave HERE?""); the creepy dude that runs the place seems like he probably isn't going to let Pembroke leave; and the audience can infer that Lambert isn't going to get to leave either. The movie teases the audience with ominous tidbits. The guy - a baron, I think - who used to own the sanitarium was interested in preserving his ""pure"" bloodline. Lambert catches a glimpse of what appear to be sub-basement prison cells. A staffer is briefly seen wheeling what looks like a corpse under a sheet through some hidden doorway in the middle of the night. What, oh what, can these folks be up to??Well... the guy who runs the sanitarium (Volmer, played by Jason Isaacs) is over 100 years old. He's conducting human experiments (I guess) that involve snakes. It's not clear if it's the snakes or their venom, or both, that are his interest. This is never explained. If I had to guess, I'd say that Volmer is experimenting on his patients because he wants to live forever, or at least long enough to marry & impregnate his daughter/niece (pure bloodline) who also lives at the sanitarium and whom Lambert befriends and ultimately frees. But back to the snakes, which are always in water. Sometimes they're real. Sometimes they're imaginary. (Or are they?) Sometimes they devour a whole human being or a corpse. Sometimes they swim around you in a circle in a pool of water, but don't bite. Other times they hang out in the back-part of the toilet and make the handle jiggle, then swim away when Lambert takes the lid off. Patients of the sanitarium also seem to be consuming large quantities of water that is, I'm guessing, filled with snake parts or baby snakes, or something. Drinking all this snake-filled water contributes to being able to breathe underwater (of course!) and slipping into a dream-like state where you never want to leave the sanitarium. We also learn that some patients ultimately die of dehydration, despite all that water-drinking. What any of this has to do with human life extension or Volmer's desire to procreate with his daughter/niece is anyone's guess. At one point, Lambert is strapped into a dentist's chair and has a dentist drill a big hole in his front tooth (who knows why), but manages to somehow escape in ways that are not made clear to the audience and seem unlikely. Later, they fix his teeth... I guess. Either that or being forced-fed snake water somehow regrows your teeth after making them fall out. Other irrelevant sub-plots are that Lambert's father committed suicide years earlier, and his mother is in some sort of assisted living facility and likes to paint little ballerina statues. She also dies before the movie ends. (Or does she?) Oh, and there's also a rape scene. Of a teenager. If you like nonsensical movies about snakes and torture and incest and being forced-fed snake water, then this is definitely the film for you. Long story short, the end of the movie is a hot mess. I'm not sure if it's a failure of the script or the editing. The cast is good, considering what they had to work with. I've seen Jason Isaacs and Celia Imrie in other movies, and they're both fine actors. My suggestion for anyone who hasn't seen the movie yet is watch for about 90 minutes, then change the channel and make up your own ending. It'll be better than what's in the movie.",A Cure for Wellness
485,n-33848,Absolutely love it,9,11 April 2018,"This is the kind of movie that I would rate 8.5/10. It is not like scary horror movie , it more like the details , what you realise afterwards gives you the chill. Every scene seems separate but they are actually connected together , not like cliche connected, where everything just so make sense when you see it. I would like to think it as after you see it you don't actually get it and then it somewhat reminds you somewhere but you still a bit confused, the more you watch the better understanding you got.",A Cure for Wellness
486,TJTeru,Unique.,9,7 June 2018,"For me, this was one of those movies that rolls around in the back of the mind long after it's over, and it took some time to hit me that the ostensible B-movie plot about a sinister wellness retreat with a hidden purpose wasn't really what the movie was about.What was it about then? Well, that's the beauty if it... who knows! Nothing, probably. For sure, there's a surfeit of pieces to this puzzle - they're even collected and laid out for us by Celia Imre's cruciverbalist inpatient character. But they don't all quite fit together, whichever way you try to arrange them. And I think deliberately. At one point, the ""clues"" are literally scattered to the wind. It's not even entirely clear who is the real protagonist after all is said and done; the executive, or the girl whose dream it is - if it is.I loved the languid atmophere - Dane DeHaan shambling on squeaky crutches through increasingly disturbing levels of the wellness centre was hypnotic. I enjoyed being immersed in the dream logic of it all; confusing flashbacks and a timeline that doesn't *quite* make sense. And I really appreciated the ""uncanny valley"" imagery; a just-too-deep swimming pool, the implausibly precarious breathing apparatus in the isolation tank, or the gleeful feeling of gliding gracefully down a winding mountain road on a pushbike at an improbable speed, all lavishly realised.I'm no fan of gore but even the moments of body-horror (involving axes, drills, tubes and eels inserted into places which in an ideal world they wouldn't be) were somehow so preposterous and over-the-top that I didn't mind them one bit. (The only image I couldn't stomach was the attention the director gave to the poor CGI stag's reaction to being involved in a car accident.)Okay, it's no Citizen Kane, but the production design and cinematography is certainly up there, so if nothing else it's a pleasure to look at.Negatives are a running time that *slightly* overstays its welcome, the tonal shift in the last 20-minutes or so might put some people off, though I felt it was appropriately bonkers turn given the kooky premise of the whole thing. And it is guilty of a bit too much repetition towards the end (yes, yes... the lipstick is a symbol - I GET IT!!!!!)Overall, though - what a unique and wonderful movie! Original, unsettling, lavish, sumptuous, and above all - FUN! It's a real shame that despite its flaws something so different didn't go down well with audiences.",A Cure for Wellness
487,mbb-34013,Fun Film,6,19 October 2018,"Something different. Mia Goth plays Ivanka and her father is a scheming liar who charges people a lot and hypnotizes them to pay him while he screws them over.
A must film for those seeking something different or just love Donny two-bits and his girlfriend Ivanka.
The employee is also a liar which fits right in",A Cure for Wellness
488,tikofv,One of the worst movies I've seen,1,14 November 2020,"This is my first review. I felt like writing it in order to emphasise how terrible this movie was. Yes, it was THAT terrible. So many plot holes and inexplicable happenings. And let's not kid ourselves. This is not because the creators wanted the audience to find their own answers. This is no 2001 Space Odyssey and the director is no Kubrick.
Wasted minutes of my life.",A Cure for Wellness
489,xkh-33182,The Good And The Not So,6,21 November 2018,"The film is gorgeous to watch and begins with an interesting premise. The scenery and the intrigue are enough to power the viewer to motor on. The bulk of the story, however, really makes little sense. That so many otherwise smart or aware people would either be conned or allow themselves to be herded and do nothing to resist is inexplicable. Scripts need to try harder nowadays The reference to Ivanka and Donald is gross - I assume even in deep Republican country ... I hope - and should be disturbing to most.",A Cure for Wellness
490,kaczmm,"Visual masterpiece, poor story",4,18 November 2020,"Partially ""Hostel"", partially ""Coma"" nearing not any of either. Gore Verbinsky directed one of the best horrors of early 2000's - ""The Ring"" - and one can sense the resemblance as well. The movie is beautiful visually, the score complements it almost perfectly, the cast performs at their best but the story kills the whole effect. And the ending is absolutely terrible.",A Cure for Wellness
491,gbriggs-48365,Visually Compelling Alchemy on Screen,8,28 December 2018,"As Julius Evola once said - Alchemy is a royal art and not a sacerdotal one. That is, it is incestuous by nature. The pervasive display of water and fire in the film, and the way it underpins the story, suggests an alkahest at the root of the father-daughter relationship. The film fails only in its sloppiness of plot, with the hero jumping to conclusions faster than the audience can be expected to follow, but this can be forgiven thanks to the stunning cinematography.",A Cure for Wellness
492,annamariekimak,2 hours you'll never get back,1,14 January 2019,I don't make reviews but this movie just genuinely sucked so bad I felt the need to make one. I'm a sucker for good cinematography but it can only take you so far. This movie was promising at the start but quickly turned into a mess and while I'm all for cheesy and bad movies I can't forgive it.,A Cure for Wellness
