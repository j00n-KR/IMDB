0,SnoopyStyle,solid biopic,7,1 May 2016,"It's 1965 L.A. Jim Morrison (Val Kilmer), UCLA film student, meets Pam Courson (Meg Ryan). He quits school and forms The Doors with Ray Manzarek (Kyle MacLachlan), John Densmore (Kevin Dillon), and Robby Krieger (Frank Whaley). They become one of the foremost counter culture rock banks of the era. The band drifts apart as Jim travels a different path with witchy journalist Patricia Kennealy (Kathleen Quinlan). In 1970, he faces charges for exposing himself during a Miami concert. He's living with Pam when he dies in Paris at age 27 in 1971.Director Oliver Stone delivers a solid biopic with his cinematic style to depict the drugged out hippie time and the chaotic nature of the band. Val Kilmer delivers his most impressive performance of his career. The movie could probably add some drama but I'm not sure how exactly. The world is burning down and he's a part of the chaos. His end is predictable for fans and newcomers alike. There may be a dramatic story in there somewhere.",The Doors
1,Hitchcoc,Superb Performance...Incredible Casting,9,5 January 2017,"I totally agree with several before me that at some point in the film, one forgets he is watching Val Kilmer play the late Jim Morrison. This is a marvelous performance by a gifted actor. His physical appearance and voice really capture the essence of one of the top five or six rock bands ever. There is lots of documentary footage of the doors because they came along when videotaping and filming were everywhere, so to capture a realistic display of performances in a film had too be good. We get to watch the guys slowly evolve. We get to see how Morrison held sway over the group. Ray Manzarek had an incredible talent of his own, and yet he kept being dwarfed by the charismatic lead singer. There were times when Morrison's performances were almost transcendent. The music is really good here as well.",The Doors
2,kosmasp,Another one,7,6 April 2007,"Another Stone movie that I do review ... ;o) It's not only because I only watch Stone movies (I don't) or only review his movies (again I don't), but because he has done so many ... and I haven't even watched all of them (which might say something about me, when you know the fact that I might have seen every movie Jean Claude van Damme is in ... Talk about guilty pleasure!)Anyway let's get down to business: The Doors is obviously as the title would suggest a movie about house entrances ... Sorry couldn't resist a silly joke. It's of course a movie about the group the Doors, although the main focus lies upon Jim Morrison (played by Val Kilmer). One of the career highlights of Val Kilmer, someone who saw him here, would've thought his future had to look bright in the movie industry. Forward to today and he's more known for being difficult on set It's a shame, as he has shown (in the Doors and other movies) that he can be a great actor.I was (and maybe still am?) not fully aware of the whole Doors/Morrison story. Let's call it their ups and downs, if you will. Stone bases his movie on facts, but took the liberty of making up things, as he went along (making the film). Which is his right as a filmmaker, but something that some people didn't take that lightly, accusing him of being a liar. A parallel to another movie he did recently, about a great conqueror, where he was accused the same things ... although again he was just trying to make a fictional movie about a real thing ... And I assure you, you don't have to be on drugs to get this movie! :o)",The Doors
3,classicsoncall,"""You got a problem with doors?"" - Pamela Courson",7,24 November 2014,"Within the span of a year, three of Rock's legends were dead. Hendrix, Joplin and Morrison were pretty much household names among music fans of the era, and their passing shocked and confused everyone. They were all twenty seven years old which conjured up a sort of bad luck omen for other musicians on the way up. This all happened over forty years ago and it seems like just yesterday.I don't think I've ever seen an actor channel another person's identity the way Val Kilmer did here. Not only in the uncanny resemblance to Jim Morrison, but the way he captured Morrison's voice and sound was simply amazing. Recalling those days back in the Seventies, I can't say that I was that much of a Doors fan though I did enjoy their music well enough. You knew there was something definitely 'out there' with the lyrics to many of Morrison's songs. What I didn't know at the time was how much he indulged in alcohol and mind altering drugs to the point of incoherency on a regular basis.You never know watching films like this how much license was taken with the characters and events as shown on screen. Oliver Stone adds another whole dimension to that. For what it's worth, the picture seems to do a fairly credible job, at least chronologically, of the band's rise to fame and Morrison's role as front man. It's just a shame that hugely talented artists like Morrison and his contemporaries couldn't refrain from their self destructive tendencies. They'd still be performing for audiences today if not for lack of self control.",The Doors
4,lee_eisenberg,"love this movie two times, and forever after that",10,12 August 2005,"Probably no music biopic has ever done a greater job looking into its subject than ""The Doors"". Focusing mainly on Jim Morrison (Val Kilmer), we get to see his masterful ability to write songs, but also his demons and his descent into complete madness. Jim Morrison was a genius and a nut. The movie never makes the mistake of becoming a litany of songs: it looks at the historical context, with the Vietnam War and everything else that made up the '60s. Val Kilmer does an incredible job playing Jim Morrison, and Meg Ryan is equally good as his girlfriend Pamela. Believe you me, there will never be another Jim Morrison. When he died in 1971, that really was the end.When I went to Paris in 1994, I went to Pere Lachaise and saw Jim Morrison's grave. There are signs pointing to it.",The Doors
5,moonspinner55,Typically overbaked Oliver Stone freak-out,4,8 July 2001,"Rather foolish chronicle of psychedelic hard rock band The Doors, whose lead singer/poet laureate, Jim Morrison, caused quite a stir in the shockable 1960's. Director/co-writer Oliver Stone pines hard for the appropriate atmosphere, but his dialogue is ridiculous and the overall presentation is arty and alienating. Val Kilmer bears a striking resemblance to Morrison, but is unable to ""break on through to the other side"" of Stone's plastic din. Supporting performances are mostly strong, save for Meg Ryan looking lost in an unplayable part as Morrison's dippy spouse.** from ****",The Doors
6,Quinoa1984,"""Nothing to touch the earth, not to see the sun, nothing left to do but run, run, run, let's run.""",10,26 April 2003,"This is just a sampling of the lyrics that singer/writer Jim Morrison contributed to his group The Doors, and just this, as part of his epic piece ""The Celebration of the Lizard"" shows his skill as a master of the written word. He is shown in Oliver Stone's The Doors as a shy, though often obnoxious and crude, persona who self describes himself in one scene: ""I think of myself as a sensitive, intelligent human being, but with the soul of a clown that forces me to blow it at the most crucial of moments."" He may have blown it in the end, but it makes for a fascinating story.As being a Doors fan, the music and words are the best character of the movie- the songs represent feelings and emotions, desires and hatreds, and other facets of life in the late 60's, are indispensable gems of rock and blues. While the Doors recorded only six albums together (not counting American Prayer, Morrison's awesome feat of an album) each one is still transfixed into the minds of people all over the world. It's thirty-two years since the king died, but in another thirty-two he will still be remembered. And that is a fact that Stone plays with like Travis Bickle in front of the mirror with his guns in Taxi Driver. He reveals only Morrison's known persona, and not the quiet moments. The concert recreations are grand, but there isn't more of the sweet Jim (one glimpse of such a Jim is seen at a birthday party when he gives out gifts as ""Chief Mojo Risin)What is shown is splendid enough for his abilities- he paints a vivid picture of Los Angeles 1965 onward, with Val Kilmer in the second best acting job of 1991 (deserved of an Oscar nomination), and puts Jim in the middle. He is a man who is fascinated with death, with man's wills to power, and how life gets painful without the chemicals top open the mind. Kilmer gets so much into your head in this film that by the end you'll love him, hate him, or feel wonder about him. I felt wonder about him, wonder why he looked to heroes who gave him such ideas about the love of death, wonder why he felt the need to take it to the limits. But his desires are Stone's as well, and while this isn't a perfect film, it's one that isn't easily forgotten. A+",The Doors
7,wes-connors,Weird Scenes Inside the Gold Mine,7,9 November 2009,"Like it says here, on the silvery special two-disc DVD set, ""Jim Morrison (Val Kilmer), one of the most sensual and exciting figures in the history of rock and roll, explodes on the screen in 'The Doors', the electrifying movie about a time called the sixties and a legendary outlaw who rocked America's consciousness - forever. Meg Ryan, Kyle MacLachlan, Frank Whaley, Kevin Dillon, and Billy Idol also star."" Probably, it would be more accurate to describe Mr. Idol's appearance as a cameo. And, Ms. Ryan and the others are merely featured players; this is an imaginary biography of Jim Morrison, tripping in the limelight.Five to One It's not even close to opening ""The Doors"" - but, the film does include an appropriately mesmerizing simulation by Val Kilmer (as Jim Morrison). Mr. Kilmer is so good he almost makes up for the surprising lack of substance (but not substance abuse) and reality. Director Oliver Stone, who did so well with previous 1960s-based films, is unable to present an honest picture of Mr. Morrison. Certainly, it hurts that Morrison isn't around to offer advice - but, ""Other Voices"" (the other members of the band) are extended thanks at the end of the film, indicating they approved of and/or contributed to the contents of this biography.People Are Strange Unfortunately, the film skips over Morrison, Ray Manzarek (Mr. MacLachlan), John Densmore (Mr. Dillon), and Robby Krieger (Mr. Whaley) as musicians. The legendary melding of Morrison's moody poetics with Mr. Manzarek's rock sensibilities (the ""Moonlight Drive"" at Venice Beach ) is covered, but the creation of actual music that mattered is scuttled to focus almost singularly on Morrison's alcoholic acid trip. Morrison was cruel, kind, and often very drunk - but, he and the other Doors were much more worthy than wasted. This film is technically sound, and Kilmer's performance is excellent. If only it were more insightful ******* The Doors (2/23/91) Oliver Stone ~ Val Kilmer, Meg Ryan, Kyle MacLachlan, Frank Whaley",The Doors
8,michaelRokeefe,"Bust on through to the other side. Sex, drugs and Rock 'n' Roll!",7,21 June 2002,"Dynamic and explosive story of a L.A. band trying to deal with discovery, fame and dealing with its moody lead singer, who has his own demons to fight. Oliver Stone directs this ode to The Doors. Some of the scenes are almost duplicates of actual events. And on the other hand you also deal with many inaccuracies. It is quite apparent that this movie is based on the myth of Jim Morrison and The Doors and does not get too much farther from that. At times it seems that the other members of the band are only sidemen to the moody, energetic, blatantly sexual front man. Not since Kurt Russell gave us the excellent portrayal of Elvis Presley in ELVIS(79)have we had a powerful performance like Val Kilmer as Morrison. Kilmer even does some of the vocals himself. Fans of The Doors no doubt will knit-pick this film to death and love it at the same time. It is well worth watching several times. Besides the flawless Kilmer, also in the cast are: Kathleen Quinlan, Michael Madsen, Kyle MacLachlan, Meg Ryan, Kevin Dillon and Billy Idol. Love it two times and two times more.",The Doors

10,LeonLouisRicci,No Place Left to Hide but the Other Side,8,16 March 2014,"Fascinating the Folly of Fame, Fortune, and Failure. Jim Morrison had all of these including the Folly. Forever Wanting to be Heard and Heeded, He became Immediately Aware that this was Futile because as He so Aptly put it...""They want my Dick, not my words.""This was Probably one of the Reasons that Morrison Retreated so Readily into the Subconscious (He claimed that's where He lived) by way of Drugs and Alcohol. There was no other way to Escape the Predicament of the ""Rock Star"" Persona and Sex Symbolism that Overwhelmed His Personality and Talent.Oliver Stone Mythologizes in Movies, no matter if the Subject is a Real Person (JFK, Nixon) or a Fictional Construct (NBK). That's what He does as a Director and Artist and there is No Doubt when One is Watching an Oliver Stone Movie that it is a Picturesque Presentation Pulsating with Flourishes of the Medium. The Doors is a Smooth Looking Film with a Seamless Portrayal by Val Kilmer and the 1960's Setting Looks Great. The Concert Scenes Especially have a Vintage Verisimilitude that Cannot be Over Praised. The Movie is so well done that it Hurts while Watching the Self Destructive Behavior and the Erosion of Spirit into a Cauldron of Excessive Pollution by Substances, most Especially Alcohol.When Jim is Feeding His Head with Psychoactives like Peyote, LSD, and Marijuana there is a Spark and a Stimulation by a Receptive, Caring Soul, but when He takes to the Bottle the Fire that has been Lit is Immediately and Irreparably Snuffed Out. Death is the Final Flameout for this Sensitive, Seductive, Shaman. There was Actually no other place to Hide.",The Doors
11,morrison-dylan-fan,stone Doors,8,27 May 2005,Having been a longtime fan of the Doors I have been waiting to see how a filmmaker like Stone (Who did great work with JFK and Nixon)Could make a film about such a much loved band.If you first look at it as a film.I would say Stone did a very good job showing how the 60s were.But the main problem is the Screen writing which is a thing that hurts some of Stones other films (mainly the third act of Platoon)Stone packs the first two acts in but runs out when the film gets to The End.Val Kilmar acting in the film is some of the best ever done by any actor.Finish: A very good film (but should not be viewed as a whole look into Morrisons life.),The Doors
12,Wuchakk,"A hypnotic film, but it emphasizes the negative side of Jim Morrison and is filled with fabrications",5,14 March 2014,"RELEASED IN 1991 and directed by Oliver Stone, ""The Doors"" chronicles the Southern California band The Doors and their rise and fall between 1966-1971. The film focuses on charismatic singer Jim Morrison (Val Kilmer) who falls into alcoholism and drug-addiction. He flew to France in March, 1971, to join his girlfriend, Pamela Courson (Meg Ryan), and pursue a different career, but died the next summer due to his ongoing substance abuse. The other band members are played by Kyle MacLachlan (Ray Manzarek), Frank Whaley (Robby Krieger) and Kevin Dillon (John Densmore).I'm not old enough to remember The Doors. The first time I heard of them was when my older brother asked me if I knew of them. I busted out laughing saying, ""The Doors? Why don't they just call themselves The Window Sills."" Yeah, I thought the name was pretty lame until I discovered Morrison's reasoning behind it:There is what is known; And there is what is unknown; In between are the doorsAnother thing that won my respect was their song that was used in the opening of ""Apocalypse Now,"" which is my all-time favorite film (the original version, not ""Redux""). After that I bought their ""Best Of"" album and my impression was that their sound was horribly dated, even THEN. Over time, however, I've come to respect The Doors' music because it's so unique. They don't sound like anyone else. They have a weird, moody vibe, even their 'hits,' augmented by a strange carnival feel. Over top of it all is Morrison's commanding and haunting vox. I prefer their more artistic songs like ""Riders on the Storm"" and ""The End"" as opposed to their 'hits,' but who can deny the catchiness of ""Light My Fire"" or the goofy charm of ""People are Strange""?The film focuses on Jim Morrison and leaves the viewer with the impression that he was a miserable artistic-genius type who had no sense of moderation; he sought to escape his personal struggle through loose sex, substance misuse and rock 'n' roll. His excessive self-abuse eventually spilled over to those closest to him and ultimately landed him in a premature grave. His body lies in Paris, a mecca to his fans who have spray-painted the surrounding monuments with gaudy graffiti, some of it profane. The image this leaves you with is that Jim Morrison is no fun to be around, even in death.So ""The Doors"" is pretty much the ultimate story of sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll. Stone said he based his view of Morrison, as depicted in the film, on 160 transcripts of people that actually knew him or were around him and the band. From these documents emerged a central truth about Morrison's final years, an image of wild excess. Because of this, I was left with a bad impression of the man. I felt Morrison was a spaced-out, immature jerk, abusive to both himself and others, foolishly sacrificing his life and talents on the altar of alcohol & drug idolatry.Yet this was only part of the truth. Thankfully the 37-minute documentary on the 'extras' disc, ""The Road to Excess"" (1997), balances things out. One of Morrison's sweethearts, wiccan Patricia Kennealy (played by Kathleen Quinlan in the movie), the guitarist and another guy offer the other side of the story. They properly point out that Stone's film only shows Jim's 'wild & crazy' side, emphasizing that the events depicted in the picture, while sometimes true, aren't ""all that happened."" They unanimously describe Morrison as genuine, innocent, shy, loving and gallant, an amazing person who made those around him feel important, as if he was their best friend. Robby even states that Jim was ""the most influential person I've ever met.""In addition, the documentary features numerous clips of Morrison himself, clearly showing him to be a fun-loving, nice and sane person rather than the spaced-out, abuse-driven dude shown in the film. Needless to say, the documentary helps round-out one's image of the man.BOTTOM LINE: Val Kilmer doesn't just play Jim Morrison, he IS Jim Morrison. This is no small feat and vital to the film in light of the fact that he appears in practically every frame. He should have won an award. In any case, if you're in the mood for something that captures that late-60s counter-culture vibe ""The Doors"" is worth checking out, but it tends to exaggerate things in the name of mythmaking, which is usually the case with movies. For instance, Jim never lit up a closet door with Pamela locked inside (rolling my eyes), the idiotic Thanksgiving dinner sequence never happened and the naked revelries at concerts (and the bonfire) are overblown fabrications. Still, the movie's mesmerizing in a spaced-out way and highlighted by The Doors' music throughout. Unfortunately, the first half is superior to the second half, which becomes too unpleasant, offering a very limited and unflattering impression of Morrison. That's why it's essential to also watch ""The Road to Excess"" on the bonus disc or, better yet, the excellent 2009 documentary ""The Doors: When You're a Stranger,"" which exclusively uses footage and photos from 1966-1971. Another problem with Stone's movie is that it loses its dramatic pull in the second half in preference for hypnotic yet chaotic visual mayhem, not to mention outright lies. Lastly, in ""The Road to Excess"" Oliver Stone makes a couple of really asinine statements. Commenting on Morrison, he states: ""To live life intensely and well and die young and achieve everlasting fame & glory is the greatest. It's Achilles, it's Alexander, it's... Jim Morrison."" Huh? Another dubious line is: ""The road to excess leads to the palace of wisdom."" Is he on drugs? Jim's road of excess led straight to an early grave, not enlightenment.THE FILM RUNS 2 hours 20 minutes. GRADE: C (but the ""The Road to Excess"" documentary gets an A-/B+)",The Doors
13,safenoe,Could have been a contender,6,24 September 2021,"Perhaps this movie played better on the big screen, but on the small screen it was okay. If you want a behind-the-scenes look on The Doors, read Barry Gremillion's book ""I killed Charles Bronson's cat"" which details his role as location manager for The Doors, and the way Oliver Stone managed the huge number of extras.One memorable scene was the one with Kathleen Quinlan and Val Kilmer (or was it a body double because I read it was a body double, a crew member I think?) when they did the beast with two backs.",The Doors
14,whpratt1,Excellent Film,7,8 October 2007,"If anyone did not know anything about Jim Morrison and his rise to fame as a great Rock ""N"" Roll performer, Director Oliver Stone gave one fantastic biography in this film. Jim Morrison was played by Val Kilmer who gave a very outstanding performance who put his heart and soul into this role along with Meg Ryan, (Pamela Courson) who is a faithful young girl who fell in love with Jim after he walked into her bedroom and broke up her marriage. Pamela stayed with Jim through out his entire career from 1960 until his death in the 70's. There is nothing left for your imagination, plenty of female nudity, sex, drugs and indecent exposure by Jim Morrison on the stage of one of his rock band concerts which caused great commotion and put Jim Morrison into a court of law with jail sentences. Great film about a performer who had a great message but lost his way by using drugs and booze.",The Doors

Editing is sharp.Performance-Wise: Val Kilmer is At His Finest. He plays the legendary musician with mesmeric ease. Undoubtedly, its among the finest performances from the early 1990's.

16,=G=,For Doors fans only,6,4 July 2002,"Oliver Stone's ""The Doors"" tells of the rise to demise of Jim Morrison, lead for the title rock band, icon of the hippy culture, and celebrated/notorious/controversial rock musician. The film focuses on Morrison's brief six year career and features a fine performance by Kilmer, much of ""The Doors"" music, and plenty of Hollywood sensationalism. I watched the film as a matter of curiosity since I lived through the period but never really knew who Morrison was (which pretty much makes me no expert) and found myself doing a lot of fast forwarding through the music and concerts. Unfortunately, Morrison wasn't all that interesting making the film of questionable value to anyone who was not a ""Doors"" or Morrison fan. B-",The Doors
17,MovieAddict2016,A mixed bag.,6,18 August 2005,"""The Doors"" is one of my all-time favorite bands, I love just about every one of their songs, most of all ""Light My Fire,"" ""Break On Through,"" ""Peace Frog,"" ""The End,"" ""L.A. Woman,"" ""Roadhouse Blues"" and so on and so forth.This movie doesn't do the band justice. It's all about Jim Morrison, played by Val Kilmer. It should have just been called ""Jim: The Druggish Semi-True Biography."" It's all about visual style, and little substance. Even for a film about Jim, it's not very well-made.Jim's childhood is almost totally ignored - there's an opening sequence about an Indian spirit carrying over into his soul, but that's it. His lover back in the '60s, a self-proclaimed ""witch,"" says on the DVD that the ""real Jim Morrison"" she knew and loved is ""not in this movie."" Oliver Stone even complains that he felt Meg Ryan's performance as Jim's wife was too self-conscious and unconvincing. I totally agree. As Stone points out, she's too self-aware -- she covers her nudity in one scene, and that would have never happened back in the '60s, ESPECIALLY if you were alone, with your husband, in bed.Val Kilmer sounds and acts the part well but really doesn't look much like Jim. It doesn't matter because he's so convincing through his physicality that his features don't detract from the realism - I never for a moment thought, ""It's just Kilmer."" It's too bad that such a great performance is wasted on a movie that is just OK. Visually, ""The Doors"" is superb. It's really trippy, ""Apocalypse Now""-style stuff that captures the tone of The Doors, as well as the era itself. It has a few moments of good energy and character exploration, such as Jim's exposure to a crowd shortly before his death.But overall Stone focuses on the visual too much and not enough on the story itself. The soundtrack rocks, the cinematography and outer layer of the film is amazing - but that's about it.Hopefully someone will come along in the future and match the visuals of this film, but add a heart and soul - after all, that's what Morrison was most famous for during his time, and it's just a little ironic that the film lacks passion and soul.",The Doors
18,DKosty123,"Burn Out City, Short Lived",7,26 January 2008,"This movie centers on Jim Morrison, not the Doors group. Val Kilmer actually makes a stunning portrayal of Jim Morrison on screen. The accuracy is excellent as it shows just how a man & lots of sex & illegal drugs can burn him out in a hurry.Meg Ryan as Morrisons main (but not only) squeeze is an excellent acting job by her too. She is clearly support but I was surprised by how well she does in a small but important role.Recreating the atmosphere of the 1960's is pretty well done. The 60's are portrayed pretty well as a decade where young women believed that liberation was trying to strip naked & streak through concerts. At one point in the film, Morrison gets the Jack Black treatment by the audience as he dives into it and is carried around. Black does this late in School of Rock & might have been inspired by this film.There's lots of female adult nudity in this one, & a plenty good soundtrack featuring a lot of the Doors great hits.",The Doors

There are however quite a number of things that really did happen that are added to the film - most of the things in the movie really happened (as I mentioned just a small handful of things that didn't happen in reality).As far as the casting goes I think everyone was great. This is the film that got my attention towards Val Kilmer - I never really paid much attention to him as an actor before I watched this film for the first time a few years ago. Kilmer really did a great job at portraying Morrison. He did his best and pulled it off well in my book.I don't view this movie as ""the gospel"" of The Doors band but I enjoy the film as simply a fun rock movie film with some true to real life events.

20,sol1218,When the music' over turn out the light,7,5 September 2011,"***SPOILERS*** The true an tragic story of psychedelic rock music icon Jim Morrison, Val Kilmer, who together with his group ""The Doors"" went from the heights of Mt. Olympus to the depths of the Qattara Dpression in less then five years. It was in 1965 when Morrison was attending UCLA Film school that he had a revelation, helped by getting stoned on drugs, in the California Desert that he realized that his true calling was in music not film. Now back in civilization Morrison tried his hand on music and with three of his friends Ray Manzaredk Robbie Krieger & John Densmore, Kyle MacLachian Frank Whaley & Kevin Dillion, formed the rock group ""The Doors"" and the rest is rock & roll or hard rock history.It what seemed that like almost overnight Morrison's Doors became the most popular singing group in the US! Even eclipsing ""The Beatles"" & ""Rolling Stones"" in that they were home grown, born and raised in the USA, unlike their British counterparts. And what's more Jim Morrison & The Doors' music was far more original then any of the English groups. Who for the most part were only singing repackaged 1950's and early 1960's rock & roll bubble-gun music with English accents.It was at the hight of his popularity that Morrison's self-destructive qualities suddenly started to come to the surface. We get to see in the movie how Morrison began to drink and do drugs almost every hour of the day and night as he was preforming both on and off stage. His womanizing didn't help Morrison either in that he ran the risk of being sued in dozen of paternity suites from the women and young girls,as well as their outraged parents, that he engaged with . That lead to his life long woman companion Pamala Courson, Meg Ryan, becoming so depressed over Morrisons affairs, mostly with groupies, that she herself started turning to drugs on an almost daily basis! That ultimately lead to Pamala dying of an heroin overdose in 1974 at age 27. The same age that Morrison passed away from a suspected, no autopsy was preformed on his body, heroin overdose three years earlier!It was in 1969 at a concert in Miami that Morrison burnt out and a shell of his former self finally hit rock bottom and self destructed on stage in front of thousand of his fans. His once trim body bolted from beer & booze as well as being drunk and stoned out of his skull Morrison gave the performance of his life! That lead to his arrest on drug and morals, in exposing himself in public, charges that ended up putting him on ice or out of circulating form almost a year. Still Jim Morrison continued to live the kind of scuzzy and drug addictive life that had even his fellow Door members distance themselves and stopped talking to him. That's until he finally realized that his life won't last long with the damage it was doing to him both physically as well as mentally.In the early summer of 1971 Jim Morrison now trying to get his head back together and turn his already shattered life around traveled to Paris France together with Pamala to either write poetry or paint pictures. It was there that he ended up taking his last breath as well as suspected, but never proved, last mind altering drug trip. Waking up in the early morning of July 3, 1971 Morrison feeling ill and coughing up blood decided to take a hot bath in order to ease the pain. It was there that Pamala found him dead as a doornail a few hours later. Dead from the wild and crazy lifestyle that Jim Morrison lead that both immortalized as well as ended up killing him.P.S Check out the movie's director Oliver Stone as a film professor at the UCLA film school that Jim Morrison attended. There also the famed defense attorney William Kunstler playing himself as Jim Morrison's lawyer at his booze drug & indecent public exposer trail in Miami Florida.",The Doors

22,funkyfry,"Nice music, but I don't see the point",5,29 March 2008,"Maybe I'm not the ""target audience"" for this one, but I really wonder who other than huge fans of The Doors (or specifically Jim Morrison, since pretty much 99% of the movie is about him) would really find much to enjoy in this movie. Jim Morrison didn't do anything important, and if he had anything important to say it sure wasn't communicated by this movie. The movie actually makes Morrison look worse than I think he really was, in the sense that I think at his better times he was probably a better performer than what they showed here. Certainly his poetry is not the aspect of his art that I would personally choose to emphasize, and this is where it becomes pretty obvious that the people who made the movie are fans. They've set these horrible poems that he wrote to new 1980s sounding music, just really grating on the ears. Jim Morrison's poetry is OK as lyrics, nothing incredible in my opinion, but when you use them in a spoken word kind of way it betrays the weakness. Then you have to have Meg Ryan who's playing his girlfriend ooh and aaah over the lame poems, and the whole movie just starts off on a really wrong note.The way they showed the ""scene"" of that time was very cool, and the movie is very well photographed. When they're not doing Morrison's weak poetry, the songs hold the film together well enough I suppose. I liked that the film wasn't afraid to at least hint at the extremely poor quality of the band's releases from their middle period, especially ""The Soft Parade."" I recognized a lot of the locations in the film. I think the scene that was supposed to be set in Miami was filmed at what's now called the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium (used to be called just the Civic Auditorium but was renamed after Graham, who co-produced this film incidentally, died in that crash with Stevie Ray Vaughn). I saw Phil Lesh there a couple months ago. The big outdoor scenes look like they were shot on Speedway Meadow in Golden Gate Park in SF. I've seen a lot of shows there, Graham used to use it for his free shows and they still do bluegrass festivals there every year. The place they used for the ""Whiskey"" might have been the Red Devil Lounge but I'm not 100% sure on that. They also used the Warfield for some of the scenes when the Doors are supposed to be at their peak, that's the theater you see with the tiered balconies.For me the movie was mildly enjoyable because I do like some of the Doors songs and I liked the re-creation of the late 60s scene in L.A. and S.F. Another thing I liked was Crispin Glover as Andy Warhol, I didn't recognize him until the performance was over, great job. The cast is really good in general actually. Val Kilmer was very good as Morrison considering there's so little to work with. Meg Ryan had a very tough character, people don't sympathize with a groupie like her. She did OK. Coincidentally both Wes Studi and Michael Wincott were in both this movie and ""Seraphim Falls"" which I watched the same day. It made me realize how much I actually like Michael Wincott in particular, though I've never known his name until now.My main problem with the movie is just the fact that it seems to take for granted that we actually care about James Douglas Morrison. I guess we should give it credit for not straining too hard to make him out to be some kind of hero -- but then again we did get exposed to a montage that included images like Martin Luther King Jr. I don't know what the heck MLK has to do with Jim Morrison, it seems like the film is reaching for context. And all that stuff with the Native Americans, you get sick of seeing that in every Oliver Stone movie. Racial guilt is hardly a good emotion to pin your character on. Maybe I just don't get it. The image of the Native Americans are supposed to be tied to his death wish, to his idea of having a good death. As far as I can tell they got just as far in the lame movie Morrison made where he quoted Nietzsche. Either I'm really missing something, or Stone is pulling strings that he invented himself.",The Doors
23,strong-122-478885,Riders On The Storm,7,1 February 2017,"Back in the mid-1960's, before one of rock's most awesome singers, Robert Plant of Led Zeppelin, stepped into the limelight (along with his talented comrades) and conquered the world of rock'n'roll - It was singer Jim Morrison of The Doors who ruled (in my opinion) as the reigning King of the Vocal Chords.Right from the start, director Oliver Stone's evocative film, The Doors, makes no excuses for not being a panoramic view of the entire band as a whole. This film's obviously myopic focus is on that of Jim Morrison who is presented to the viewer as though he were both a separate entity and as the entire embodiment of the band, The Doors, itself - All in one whirlwind of a package.The movie ""The Doors"" contains some of the most exceptionally exhilarating live concert-footage that I've ever seen recorded on film. And, as an added bonus - It would be a literal understatement to say that Val Kilmer, as Jim Morrison, puts in a truly remarkable performance.The only real flaw to mar this otherwise finely-executed film was the despicable performance of Meg Ryan who played Morrison's hippie-dippie girlfriend, Pamela Courson.

24,mjneu59,just another Oliver Stone fever dream,2,14 November 2010,"In an early scene of Oliver Stone's typically overwrought tribute to one of the 6o's more typically overwrought bands, young rock messiah Jim Morrison makes an uninvited visit (over the balcony) to the Venice Beach pad of his girlfriend Pamela Courson, who says, ""don't you believe in doors?"" Morrison's reply, ""they're a waste of time"", not only provides the one moment of (unintended) wit in the entire film, but sounds an ominous warning to what follows: another jarring one-note melodrama from a director clearly too preoccupied with his own bogus sense of cinematic 'style'. Stone's ballistic visual scheme and grade school symbolism are perfectly matched (in his own mind, at least) to the feverish 60's counter-culture of sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll, but even at such a strenuous length (135 minutes) the film only scratches at the surface of its subject: concert follows scandalous concert, with no variation in tone or texture, until the Lizard King finally overdoses and dies. Val Kilmer does a credible rendering of Morrison's languid sex-and-death mannerisms, but the ill-judged caricatures of Ed Sullivan and Andy Warhol are foolish, as is the non-existent bust added to the martyr's graffiti-covered Paris tomb: it resembles Kilmer more than Kilmer resembles Morrison.",The Doors

Val Kilmer folks if for no other movie he ever did this is the one that will knock you're socks off completely,, he is better in this than Heat .

It has none of the power of its accompaniments, however it is an accurate depiction of the life and times of 'James Morrison.The cast are quite sensational and very convincing with Kilmer a stand out as the spaced out Morrison. The era and the music is recreated splendidly and one is given a real feel for what was a troubled time. Stone's movie is very honest, never trying to sway your emotions and always letting you come to your own conclusions.Never a sensational film (and not to my liking), but still one heck of an insight.Wednesday, October 28, 1992 - Video",The Doors
29,TOMNEL,"Typical of Oliver Stone, style over everything else.",4,15 March 2008,"The Doors, or more appropriately, Jim Morrison: The Movie, is about Jim Morrison's short, but influential life from his failed film career to the band The Doors, to his untimely death. I'm not quite sure what this movie was trying to say about Morrison and the band. If it was saying that Jim was anything but a crazy drug addict, then it failed, because that's the only side we see of him here. Occasionally, Stone lets us see his poetic side, but very rarely, and when it does show it's because he's tripping on acid. There's no emotional connections to any character, except maybe Morrison's girlfriend Pamela Courson, but not much for her either. So, with no emotion and no character development, what we have is the outline of what happened with The Doors, and a lot of Val Kilmer imitating Jim Morrison's singing.Everything about this was not all bad. The acting is quite good. Val Kilmer was very believable playing the hard rocker who didn't care for anyone else's opinions. Meg Ryan was good as his struggling girlfriend. Kathleen Quinlin is very good as his critic sex mate. Even Kyle McLaughlan was good as the keyboard player Ray Manzerack. Along with being a good actor, McLaughlan also had the best character, an advocate of Morrison's work, but also a sense of reason that was never listened to. Frank Whaley and Kevin Dillon play the other two band members in small thankless roles.The direction starts off pretty cool, but by the end turns into a major headache. Stone constantly uses blue and red lenses on the camera, no matter what the scene, so instead of being used to symbolize sadness, or anger, they're just there to look cool. A lot of odd zoom ins and strange camera angles are used, and again, they start pretty neat, but after you realize Oliver Stone is just throwing them about for no reason, they get tiring. This whole movie can be compared to his later film ""Natural Born Killers"". They both have uncaring character, a weird style that get's to be a huge headache, and an ending making us think ""Why should we care?""It's really hard to tell why this film was made. Obviously because Oliver Stone wanted to make a film on this popular band, but to show what? Was it to show how influential Morrison was? Because it showed he was influential to some people, but that was because of his crazy music, not himself personally. Was this meant as an homage to the band? Because it actually made the band look bad, and if this is why it was made, then it was an even bigger failed attempt then this movie was. Or was this made because Oliver Stone liked the music and just wanted to make a movie? Probably. This had no purpose or reason to be made, except maybe to turn people on to the music, and even that didn't work for me.My rating: * 1/2 out of ****. 135 mins. R for sexuality, language, drug use and violence.",The Doors
30,dierregi,"Musically incontinent, chaotic tale of drunkard rock star",3,15 August 2016,"Another bombastic movie from Oliver Stone, notorious director of overlong, violent, chaotic movies. Allegedly, Stone wanted to pay tribute to the Doors, a group that was the soundtrack of his youth. What he ended up doing was bad-mouthing Jim Morrison.In fact, the movie should not even be titled ""The Doors, because it is almost exclusively about Morrison's debauchery and flirting with death. A relatively wealthy and healthy kid, Morrison was permanently tormented (by what?) during his short life, did not appreciate fame and fortune, and ended up as an alcoholic and a junkie.It is well known that Morrison was obsessed by a car crash he witnessed as a child. However, his report of the accident was questioned by his whole family who was travelling with him. None of his relatives saw what Jim mentioned (bodies of Indians lying on the road) and the whole accident was probably just a minor one.This episode is saying a lot about the self-aggrandizing attitude of Jim and his egotism. Not to mention that drunkards and junkies tend to be self-obsessed and boring, even – or maybe even more - when they are rock stars. Morrison's saving graces were his sex appeal and his skill with words. Stone chose to dilute the story of Morrision' self destruction with endless sequences of Kilmer (uncannily looking like Morrison) gyrating on stage, drinking, screwing every woman around and being obnoxious.I am sure nobody would like to put up with that, but at the end of the movie we have a weird scene of the Door splitting up and the other members expressing regret at Morrison's departure to France. I would have been delighted to see him go Finally, his death is treated as a mystery, as if a junkie dying of an overdose would be so mysteriousStrictly for the most die-hard fans, who no doubt will find something likable and/or regret that their hero was presented in such an unflattering fashion.",The Doors
31,triple8,An entertaining and inaccurate look at The Lizard King.,8,11 August 2003,"First of all I have to say that I quite liked this movie. It was entertaining(mildly) and great for an evening spent with friends. I'ts ROCK AND ROLL.Now-for anybody wanting to get behind Morrison the myth and know Morrison the man-this is not the movie for you.This movie doesn't get much past the drugs, groupies etc etc. Shock value-yes. Excess-yes. And as I stated it IS entertaining.But it doesn't tell you anything. This movie is not a 10 and it so could have been. I have no problem with Kilmer's acting. He really creeped me out with the physical transofrmation as well as doing his own singing(quite erie actually). All the other roles were well cast too with the possible exception of Pamela(Meg Ryan??) Sorry Oliver that was off, she's to preppy and girly girly to play a sixtie's rock star and poet's girlfriend. That said-good acting doesn't mean a thing if the movie in general(the script) doesn't cut it. Jim Morrison was one of the most influential poet and song writers in the world and I for one would have liked to see that sweet, mystical part of him, that part of him that captured hundreds of thousands of people worldwide expanded on.There is not another movie that does it but anyone wanting to get a sense of Jim would be strongly advised to read ""strange days"" a book about Jim written by his wife Patricia Keneely(did I spell it right??).There was a review posted on here that said the patricia character didn't exist. She actually did exist and was the only woman Jim ever wed. That's just one thing among many many others the movie barely touched on.So that's my review-again-entertaining-yes. Holds your interest-yes. good acting(for the most part)-yes.Deep, analytical or getting inside the incredible person that was Jim Morrison-no way baby!",The Doors

33,burlesonjesse5,"The Doors is a disturbing, overblown, trademark Oliver Stone film. But Val Kilmer is brilliant in it and that's reason to take in a viewing",7,9 May 2014,"After winning two best director Oscars (Born on the Fourth of July, Platoon respectively) at the Academy Awards, Oliver Stone could pretty much do whatever he wanted. So given his affection for 60's nostalgia, he decided to helm this 1991 biopic on one of rock and roll's all time greatest bands (one of my favorite rock groups as well). The Doors is a prime example of what a filmmaker can do if the vision of what's on screen is entirely his (not necessarily what the remaining members of The Doors themselves had intended). With as much clout as any major voice in Hollywood, Stone made an exercise that veers almost completely away from the storytelling of the band, and instead concentrates on the madness and mystery of lead singer Jim Morrison. The result is a fiery yet saturated, powerful yet overwhelming, and sad yet involving portrait of a musical icon who passed over much too early. Now I gotta warn ya, this thing is over 2 hours long and is exhausting. It's also an ambitious mess (don't worry, this is a compliment) that's filled with every Stone nuance in the book (you almost have to wear dark sunglasses to tackle the look of it). But it's saddled with a brilliant performance by Val Kilmer as the lead. And he anchors this kaleidoscope of late 60's culture bent on entertaining you if you let it. So to make things clear, I am to this day, a huge fan of Oliver Stone's 90's endeavors. He has calmed down a bit as a director these days. And don't get me wrong, I still think he knows what he's doing behind the camera. But I kinda wish the maverick in him would come back (a la The Doors). There is just too much control with his technique in present day. I kinda hate it to be honest.Anyway, this movie tells the story of the band going from heralded beginnings (guitarist Robbie Kreiger and Jim Morrison were students who met at UCLA film school) to virtual stardom, and then to an eventual break up with the lead vocalist (the drummer, keyboard player, and lead guitarist continued on but the film ends with Jim's death). The Doors chronicles the years 1965 to 1971. Two to three aspects are driven home by Stone to get his point across. One is Morrison's alienation from the other band members (Kevin Dillon as John Densmore, Kyle MacLachlan as Ray Manzarek, Frank Whaley as Robbie Krieger) through his relentless drug/alcohol abuse during their tenure. Second, we get a sort of unclear spiritual journey that Kilmer (Morrison) goes through in the form of flashbacks caused by a drug fueled haze-type behavior. Lastly, Stone puts emphasis on Morrison's relationship with his hippie girlfriend Pamela (Meg Ryan). Their love affair is volatile and dangerous. Just watching them together makes you think that they would not, and could not live very much longer. Finally, there is the music. The concert and studio recording scenes are so well filmed and seem so real (that's because the actors actually learned to play the instruments from what I understand), you get the sense that Mr. Stone really took his time to get the right attention to detail. Oh, and I almost forgot, look for Crispin Glover doing an Andy Warhol impersonation (In the film, Jim meets him at a party). With Velvet Underground's music in the background, it's a wallop of a scene in terms of sensory overload.To put it all into perspective, if you are a fan of the music via The Doors and don't mind a film that's rough around the edges, this is something worth checking out. The performances are adequate and Kilmer's turn as rock and roll's misunderstood poet is downright Oscar worthy (the reason he got snubbed could have been the film's early release in March). Yes, the overall structure of what's on screen is choppy and somewhat of a downer, but there is a storytelling light at the end of the tunnel. And as usual, Stone likes to wrap things up rather quickly. Is it justifiable after two hours and twenty minutes? Yeah, why not. By then, the audience has embraced the bruised heart of a fallen legend. Morrison is dead but the music of The Doors lives on forever. This film is a raw, battering interpretation of a band who's sound could never be copied. At close to the two hour mark, Frank Whaley (Robbie Krieger) says to Jim, ""you said you like pain. Well you run from it every chance you get."" Well, I plan on viewing The Doors again and again and believe me, no matter how intense Stone's vision gets, I certainly won't run from it. That's a guarantee.",The Doors
34,brando647,It Made a Fan Out of Me,10,7 November 2009,"Despite it's flaws, I can't help but include Oliver Stone's THE DOORS whenever I'm asked my favorite movies. I knew nothing of the band before seeing the movie and I'd only heard the name Jim Morrison in passing. This film changed all that, as it follows the Doors' formation in Venice Beach, CA in 1966, their rise to fame, and Morrison's plunge into alcoholism and ultimate demise in Paris in 1971. This film turned me into a fan of the band overnight, exposing me to the amazing music and the mystery surrounding one of music's most interesting figureheads.Seeing as how I watched this movie pre-fandom, I was able to view it with a more unbiased eye. Val Kilmer was amazing as Morrison, and I still believe so after having further exposure to Morrison through video and biographies. I can't think of any that could've done a better job portraying Morrison's coy style, erratic behavior, and tortured psyche. Kilmer's vocals were astounding, and often hard to discern from the real Morrison. Meg Ryan was hit-or-miss for me in her role as Pam Courson, Morrison's longtime lover/soulmate. There were points in the film where I felt she did a great job, and others where she didn't quite fit the role. On the other hand, the film is loaded with great performances from Kyle MacLachlan, Kevin Dillon, Frank Whaley, and, my personal favorite cameo...Crispin Glover as Andy Warhol.My only major issue with the film are the liberties Oliver Stone took with the details of Morrison's life. Those who watch this film need to understand that Stone exaggerated a good deal in this movie, tweaked history, and seemed to focus on Morrison's drunken antics rather than the tortured artist or his underlying intelligence (the man was tested at genius level IQ of 149 in grade school). Instead, Morrison is portrayed as a fool and overgrown child. I also wish the movie had given a bit more focus to the group dynamics amongst the band members, but Ray Manzarek, John Densmore, and Robby Krieger are essentially pushed into the background.Regardless, the movie is entertaining. Stone was sure to include many of the important events in the career of the Doors, from their firing at the Whiskey a Go-Go to Jim's legal troubles in New Haven and Miami. It gives you one perspective on the Morrison myth but I urge you not to accept Stone's movie as fact. If you find yourself as big a fan as me after viewing the film, do yourself a favor and read a couple of biographies on Jim. Once you've collected information, you can form your own opinion, but in the meantime, enjoy THE DOORS.",The Doors

It's not just about the music, it does try to speculate about Jim's psychology as well, and whilst it may not be true, the blend of fact with hypotheses and outright myth does create an intoxicating aura that captures the spirit of what life might have been like during Jim's phase of intense drug use...Sections of it are really trippy, even though I've always watched it straight... so, if you like the idea of The Doors music blended with weird and evocative ideas, then it could well be your thing...",The Doors
38,hall895,An ordinary film with one extraordinary performance,6,30 May 2006,"Watching Oliver Stone's The Doors can be at times a frustrating experience. Considering the central figure in the film is pretty much always drunk or stoned or both the entire plot seems to unfold in a bit of a haze. Those watching the film may come away feeling a little stoned themselves. Yet through the drug and alcohol-fueled haze this film does have a lot to recommend it. Most notably it has one of the most stunningly brilliant acting performances you could ever hope to see. Val Kilmer, playing Jim Morrison, is simply perfect in the role. It sounds clichéd but Kilmer really seems to become Morrison. The physical resemblance is eerie and their voices are so similar it is fairly impossible when listening to the film's soundtrack to figure out when exactly you're hearing Morrison and when you're hearing Kilmer. Tracing Morrison's journey from shy, reserved youth to manic, drugged-out rock god the performance by Kilmer is mesmerizing throughout.As good as Kilmer is you can't help but feel that his performance deserved to be surrounded by a better film. The film might as well have been titled ""Morrison"" because it is much more the story of one man than it is the story of his band. And therein lies much of the problem because while Kilmer is undeniably terrific, Morrison, at least as he is portrayed in this film, is not a very sympathetic character. That shy, quiet guy we see on the beach at the film's beginning becomes a bit of a monster, at times almost completely unlikable. And since the film revolves entirely around Morrison it makes the film often hard to embrace. Many would argue that Morrison was unfairly portrayed here, not nearly as mean-spirited and hot-tempered as we are led to believe. The truth probably lies somewhere in between but the fact remains that in this film it is very hard to embrace Jim Morrison and as such it is very hard to completely embrace the film.With the focus almost completely on Kilmer's Morrison the rest of the cast comes off as little more than bit players. Kyle MacLachlan as keyboardist Ray Manzarek has the most to do amongst the remaining band members and his performance is fine but it really gets swallowed up by the ever-present and always center stage Morrison. Meg Ryan, playing Morrison's longtime companion Pamela Courson, is allowed only to react to Morrison's antics and never establishes a character and identity of her own. Even when stoned out of her mind, as everybody in this film always seems to be, Pamela comes across as the wholesome girl next door who is, well, rather dull. Kathleen Quinlan has a more memorable turn as another woman in Morrison's life, Patricia Kennealy, who is anything but dull. But again her character is there only to serve Jim. It's always about Jim. Nobody could deny that Jim Morrison was the most captivating figure in The Doors. But as the film unfolds and you watch Morrison stumble from one stupor to the next you'll probably wish we could have spent a little more time with some of the other characters. This film version of Jim Morrison is a hard guy to love.So in the end what are we left with? You get one awe-inspiring, magnificent performance but that performance overshadows everything else going on in the film. You get a fascinating life story but one that unfortunately proceeds mostly in a frustrating drug-induced haze. You certainly get a tremendous soundtrack with all of The Doors' most notable songs. Well, most of them anyway. There seems to be a real yin and yang with this movie. There is plenty that is very good about it, but all that is good seems to be balanced out by something which frustrates. Jim Morrison led an extraordinary life but this film which tells his tale ends up being rather ordinary.",The Doors
39,johno-21,Dances With Wolves meets Woodstock as told by Oliver Stone,6,12 March 2006,"I first saw this during it's initial theatrical release and about a year later I was taking to Doors guitarist Robby Krieger who is credited as a technical adviser on this film. I noted to Krieger that Jim Morrison is often depicted as a dark, brooding doomed poet and I felt that was an unfair one dimensional view of him. I said that I bet Jim Morrison was probably also a very humorous guy and since Krieger knew him I asked if I was right. Krieger said I was and that Jim Morrison was one of the funniest people he had ever known. That's an example of what's wrong with this movie. Director Oliver Stone strips away the fun and humanity of Jim Morrison and makes him a dark psychedelic cartoon character. This film goes nowhere and has nothing to say. Just another example of Oliver Stone's love for revisionist history. The film looks good thanks to one of the best cinematographers of contemporary times Robert Richardson who previously had done Platoon, Born on the Fourth of July and Wall Street and would go on to do A Few Good Men, JFK. Natural Born Killers, Kill Bill, Wag the Dog, and the Horse Whisperer. Val Kilmer did an excellent portrayal of Morrison in his looks and speech and mannerisms and must have put a lot of work into his role. Unfortunately for Kilmer he's all dressed up and has nowhere to go. The Indian shaman angle to this film grabbed on to this movie and wouldn't let go. It was overdone, overblown, distracting and confusing. Every time you thought this film was about to go somewhere it would come to a halt and go in some other direction. Kathleen Quinlan, Kyle MacLachlan and Meg Ryan are among a nice cast including Crispin Glover and actor/musicians Paul Williams and Bonnie Bramlett. I would give this a 6.0 because it's not a total loss but I would not recommend it.",The Doors
40,KnightsofNi11,A self-destructive masterpiece,9,31 May 2011,"I never thought much of Val Kilmer, but after watching Oliver Stone's incredible biopic, The Doors, that perception has changed entirely. This is the ultimate story of sex, drugs, and rock n' roll. Kilmer plays frontman of the famous 60's rock band The Doors, Jim Morrison. Morrison is a self absorbed, self destructive, self proclaimed poet whose experiences with drugs, sex, and music make him a fascinating mess of a man. Kilmer portrays him to perfection in one of the most immaculate and hypnotic biopics I've ever seen.I will be honest and say that I am pretty much going to enjoy any movie about rock and roll by default. The Commitments, Almost Famous, Pirate Radio, etc. All movies I love. But it doesn't mean that is the only reason I love this film. It is, however, a damn good reason. Stone's rendition of the 60's free love era is as haunting as it is captivating. The concert scenes in this film are astoundingly hypnotic because of the mesmerizing visuals and the dark engulfing Doors music playing so crisp and so beautifully. Kilmer did all of his own singing for this film and as the film progresses you start to wonder whether Morrison himself stepped in to play his own part. Kilmer looks and sounds just like the man. The concert bits of the film are Kilmer's vocals and the soundtrack itself is the original Morrison vocals, yet you could never tell the difference. This may have been the role Kilmer was born to play.At first I was worried I wouldn't like this film by the end because of the character of Jim Morrison. He is this ridiculously self-important, pompous douche that only speaks in poetry, calling himself the Lizard King and practically proclaiming himself as a prophet. But it is these bizarre beginnings that lead to the growth of his character into the self destructive, self loathing maniac we see in the last half of the film. Love him or hate him, he is a fascinating character and watching him grow and witnessing the chaos around him is so engaging and yet so frightening. Morrison, in this film, is the poster child for a man with no limitations. The way he destroys himself through drugs and alcohol is ugly, yet you cannot take your eyes off of it. Morrison's fascination with death and how it drives him to the brink of insanity, almost longing for death because it is the ultimate high, is such an asphyxiated tragedy. As much as we tell ourselves we don't, we long to see the levels this man will stoop to and just how far his psychotic nature will take him. The Doors is a film that satisfies our asphyxiation with tragedy and the unfortunate, while telling the story through such a hypnotic and overwhelming method.I've seen a lot of Oliver Stone films and they are all fantastic, but this one has to be my favorite, thus far. Jim Morrison is just such a deranged yet fascinating man whose story is so engaging and yet so bleak and misguided. There were so many things wrong with this man and this film exemplifies them all and develops the story through such a psychedelic medium. I consider this film a masterful work of art and one of the best biopics I've ever seen. At two hours and twenty minutes, not a second of this film is wasted and I never wanted it to end.",The Doors
41,spookyrat1,Morrison Hotel!,5,17 April 2019,"The film's called The Doors, but it's most definitely not about The Doors. The Doors were a band that have been listed as one of the greatest artists of all time by magazines including Rolling Stone, which ranked them 41st on its list of the ""100 Greatest Artists of All Time"". Around the late 60's/1970 they were also frequently lauded as being one of the most exciting live acts in the world. If you're looking for a film to give you an inkling about such a band's history, this again, is not it.What this is, is an almost two and a half hour attempt by Oliver Stone to get inside lead singer Jim Morrison's head. Predictably to any one who knows anything about Morrison (and Stone), we get plenty of sex, drugs (including alcohol), but surprisingly not a great deal of rock 'n roll for a movie of this nature. Supposedly based on John Densmore's memoire Riders on the Storm, the film ends with a footnote thanking the surviving Doors members for their cooperation. However since its release, the Doors have criticised the film, as not truly being representative of the group nor Morrison himself.With good reason I should think. We know Morrison lived life to excess to such an extent that he died prematurely aged only 27, but do we really need the vast majority of the movie's running time to focus on that way too excessive lifestyle? We get the message very clearly early on. There's virtually no screen time focusing on the recording success of the first American band to have 8 consecutive gold records and sell over 100 million albums world-wide. The other three band members are given no back-stories and subsequently have no more than a shadowy impact in the story. I guess it is pretty difficult, when the Morrison character is almost in every scene. This is to take nothing away from Val Kilmer's wonderful performance as Jim Morrison. Besides looking incredibly like him, he does sound much the same too. Meg Ryan pops up intermittently as Morrison's (main) girlfriend (later wife) Pam, but she is given very little with which to work too. She either seems to. be in bed with Morrison or throwing things at him, just about in equal measure.Again with live performances, Stone just seems to concentrate on the controversial, headline attracting elements. The film is a bare cupboard in terms of providing evidence of the band's electric reputation as a live act.The end when it comes, rather ironically, comes very quickly. We hear a little of the group's final (very successful) album LA Woman haphazardly, as Jim attends a suburban party with the band, where he tells them he's going to Paris. Next thing we see is his Parisian grave ... The End! There is just no consistent balance to the narrative at all and in a film of this length, it really stands out.Bohemian Rhapsody tells a similar story as The Doors, but just does it so much better. It also primarily focuses on Queen's lead singer Freddy Mercury, who like Morrison lived a way too hedonistic lifestyle, also dying prematurely. But we do get a greater collective sense of the band itself and a very welcome focus on their music and live performances, which Oliver Stone's The Doors seems to completely forget about, to its detriment.",The Doors
42,Pedro_H,"Kilmer's amazing performance saves the day, but only just!",7,19 May 2007,"The story of the short - but influential - life of Jim Morrison and The Doors: who exploded on the music scene in the late 1960's and are still hugely popular today.(As if you don't know all this already!) The Doors were a fantastic group, and if you don't believe me just flick through a stranger's CD collection: There is usually a Doors compilation in their somewhere.But what do you want to believe about the group itself and what they represented and what they believed in? This movie believes The Doors were Jim Morrison and a group of half-assed sidekick men and to hell with the fact that some of the better tunes were written by other band members or the overall (organ based) sound had little to do with Jim Boy.Rock and roll cannot be encapsulated in two hours. All you can do is form lists and put lines through them one by one. Early life (lied about - by JM - because it didn't fit hippie fashion), form the band, band gets famous, band takes drugs, band falls out over drugs, you know the full list as well as I do - unless you are coming to rock movies for the first time.The central problem I have is I don't like the stoned or the drunk. Indeed most sober people don't. I can't care less if the person that is drunk/stoned is very talented or has written great songs or even that they are sexy. They are bores and they are bores that urinate on the carpet. JM urinated on a lot of people's carpet and from his early death it is clear that as a drinker he was a bit of a lightweight.(Often consumed - in the street fashion - straight from the bottle.)When sober (more times than this movie acknowledges) he was a big reader and a smart enough guy, but rock doesn't like smart all that much. It much prefers extroverts with an inflated sense of their own importance and who die young enough to not embarrass the fans by their middle age or worse. As Bono once said ""I don't want to be a firework that explodes for the enjoyment of the general public."" What holds this movie together is Val Kilmer. My word is he good. He looks Morrison, he acts Morrison and he sings Morrison. Nobody could be better. Even the original band were amazed. The concert scenes are so well created that they look like a documentary and - strange though it may sound - they should have recorded a full concert and put it out as an extra on the DVD. A new art form, a fictionalised version of a real 1960's gig.Indeed, Kilmer is as strong as the other band members are weak. Indeed they are so weak they are almost extras in their own movie (the title is a con - this is Jimmy and the Whoever's!) Meg Ryan is a total miscast as his nagging wife and Billy Idol (who is called Cat in the movie) seems to need to shout things at random to remind people he is still there. If you can remember the names of the actors playing the other band members or recall a line they said you need to go on the road as Mr. Memory! However at times I don't know if they are angry at Morrison or their itchy wigs.Narcotic taking (legal or illegal) is someone else's business. It is easy for me - as someone that views self-poisoning as the greatest form of madness on the planet - to claim to be moral superior just because it isn't my knee-jerk. However it does seem to work for artistic people, at least for a short while. It makes things better before it makes things much worse. And it doesn't get any worse than being in your grave at 27 - unless that is the place you want to be.To love someone you have to love them when they are old, bald or grey. The fans that desecrate his grave (and those around it) at Perè Lachaise in Paris (nothing like shown in this movie, by the way - look up the cemeteries own web site on Google) like him dead and buried. You don't even have to pay to be in his company. The Lizard King is dead, long live the next wandering poet and their entertaining and manic odes to their own self-pity...",The Doors
43,Ben_Cheshire,Absorbing movie - i didn't want it to end. (my only friend...),8,29 February 2004,"Utterly absorbing bio-pic of Jim Morrison. The name Val Kilmer is, or should be, synonymous with incredible acting that is not merely natural or convincing, but immensely fun and commanding. You may have noticed while watching his recent Wonderland - Val has the ability to make a picture. Here, he IS The Doors: The Movie. There, he WAS Wonderland. I am exaggerating, i suppose. For Oliver Stone has crafted a marvellous film which makes you feel like you've experienced what the sixties were like. Through using The Doors actual music (what was missing from the recent Sylvia, the art of the subject itself - her poetry) to help tell its story and colour its scenes, and filmic techniques to create the drug-induced world vision of Jim Morrison, Stone really takes you into the world of his movie, and the world of the sixties.This movie made me appreciate what an exciting experience The Doors were, and has actually cultivated love in me for their music. I didn't realise they had more than one classic: Light my Fire, The End, People are Strange, Love her Madly, Break on Through to the Other Side, Riders on the Storm, Touch Me, Roadhouse Blues (Let it roll, baby roll) and probably more i'm yet to discover.For a better recreation of what Andy Warhol's factory actually felt like, see I Shot Andy Warhol. Crispin Glover actually looks more like Andy than the guy who plays him in ""I Shot,"" but the guy in I Shot much better captured Andy's vagueness and almost unconsciousness while in conversation. This, however, is but three minutes in the movie and has no effect on it as a whole.Oliver Stone has an amusing cameo: a young film student, Jim Morrison, shows his short film to his class, who are uncouth and disparaging about it, after which camera pans to reveal Oliver Stone standing at the lecturn, (obviously, playing the film professor), who says: ""Why don't we ask the author what he thinks?""",The Doors
44,EijnarAmadeus,Classic Oliver Stone - Bits of Both Worlds,6,21 October 2009,"Oliver Stone's rock & roll biography THE DOORS (1991) contains a fine performance by Val Kilmer as Jim Morrison, is enchantingly shot by Robert Richardson who goes the distance in capturing the 'acid experience', and is accompanied by a fine soundtrack that may become overused when Stone paints himself into a corner. The variable film is best when Morrison and his California cools go searching in the desert and experience Native American spirituality, and when they're in studio fighting, struggling and recording, or when Kilmer runs the show with his great impressionism. The film faults when Morrison starts showing his more sensitive side concerning his childhood and romantic relationship towards Meg Ryan's character, or the fact that the artistic rambling by 'The American Poet' is mostly things you've heard when shuffling through a Doors record, and it doesn't really do much to get beneath Morrison's or the audience's skin. The film rarely surprises, and at its best it's a superficial ride of sex, drugs and rock & roll.",The Doors
45,grahamsj3,sort of OK but disjointed,6,11 July 2005,"This film tells the story primarily of Jim Morrison, the singer/poet leader of The Doors and they would prove to be one of the most influential rock groups of the 1960's. Their songs were mainly based on Morrison's poems as lyrics and touched the social conscience of America. It didn't take long for Morrison to embrace drugs and alcohol as a means to ""expand his mind"" and he became unpredictable, unstable and he began to withdraw from reality. As the drugs began to affect him, his lyrics became blacker; increasingly rambling, violent and focusing on sex and death. Onstage, his performances became the stuff of legend, vulgar and nonsensical at times and he began a downhill spiral in his personal life as well as popularity with the fans. The drugs and alcohol ultimately killed him at age 27. The film, directed by Oliver Stone, is a stuttering thing, perhaps mirroring Morrison's life. The descent into hard drugs, his alcohol excesses, sexual escapades and depravity are all portrayed very well. I think that Mr. Stone actually overdid some of the excesses, but perhaps it is more truthful this way. I believe that the film was well-cast and acted. Val Kilmer pulls off Morrison well and Meg Ryan does a creditable job as Pam, the long-term love interest. The musical score is, of course, mainly Doors music.",The Doors
46,Neptune165,The movie ain't really accurate,5,29 July 2019,"Felt that this movie gets such a bad rap. They made him to dumb in this movie. He was very intelligent. This movie kind of portrayed Jim as a drunk It didn't really show the aspects of his life or upbringing a little on how he wanted to become a poet, and how The Doors broke through with their music. what a terrible film. just a hopeless caricature. a lesson in bad acting, bad singing, and bad writing i don't hate the film but this movie according to the original band members that actually played with Jim, well its hard to follow a movie where a lot of what they are saying in this film is false but this film is 2 hours of Morrison behaving like a spoiled brat and talking stupidities nonstop Irritating because it portrayed Morrison completely wrong, like a he was a psycho when in reality he was a nice person. Val Kilmer was flopping around way too much. Worst was the part with sunglasses and the beard.. Jim was a lot calmer and introverted. I'm guessing Val just got really into the character and exaggerated him a bit more. Jim did have hyper moments and jumped around but he didn't do it constantly. He was also a lot less seductive in the way he moved. For me Kilmer far from sucked. I believe much of the reason actors seem to be over acting or too hyper when portraying a real life person is due to how it may come across on screen in the finished product maybe coming across as too flat. What was even worse was that after he was done filming the movie, it took him two years to get out of his role. The worst part is exaggerating the ""girl we couldn't get much higher"" so cringe. The movie was meh. Morrison was charismatic ally magical. The actors were shadows of the real people. But they tried.",The Doors

He captures the role in every frame of the movie. The whole cast is well thought out as a matter of fact and Stone uses them wisely. Olver Stone is one of our great film-makers and this film will be appreciated in years to come as a staple of the rock-n-roll movie.",The Doors

I am a Doors Fan when I watched this Film. I swear to hGOD I thought Jim Morrison went into Val Kilmers BODY. That is how good he was in this Film I give this Film 💯 PERCENT. That is how Good it was. He was so good was it a Film or a Document. He even looked just like him smiles, face expression, his eyes, hairstyles, everything was to the tee.

49,statuskuo,Boomers Will Love Themselves Over This,3,8 February 2021,"Yes, I appreciated The Doors music as a teen in the 1990s so I was excited to see this flick. As I'm now in my 40's I've concluded Baby Boomers are obnoxious self-important narcissists who confuse depth with non-sensical substance abusive pretentious droning.As bloated and self-congratulatory as its director Oliver Stone (who I admire when he makes films that depict real people). Yes, he is that voice of THAT generation that you mock openly in 2021. The hippie generation who still pretend like they are their childrens' friends. Who are still too cool for school and tie a ponytail off when their entire top of their head misses hair. These are the laughable flower children. Sad, I know.Excess is the name of the game with this biopic of The Doors which should probably be renamed ""Jim Morrison Annoys Me But Somehow Deserves A Movie"" Yes, the flick paints him to be a waxing poetic intellectual who just imbibed way too many things. Women and alcohol, most likely. And the hedonistic behavior, while attempting to explain his mannerism, instead makes the audience want to vomit (not Boomers though, you celebrate this blathering drunk moron).
I will give it up for Val Kilmer though. A LOT was said back in the 1990's how he enveloped Jim Morrison. And, in his own Method acting ways, probably lived like Morrison to his detriment. Most of his behavior, I would not begin to explain other than to say, a stumbling drunk is nothing to celebrate or cheer. Which is the confusion of this flick.Sad also, are the supporting characters. Specifically, Meg Ryan, whose self-conscious breast shots make her seem less a ""free the girls"" spirit than a girl next door just first experiencing what sex is. It's uncomfortable to watch her struggle to be...free. Perhaps that was her interpretation of Pamela Courson, but...boy is she annoying.Essentially, this is a who's who of cameos of 90's actors representing 60's culture. I shudder at watching a Pearl Jam biopic featuring Millenials. This should make you cringe as well.It is a WELL crafted movie. It is shot brilliantly by Robert Richardson. Whose dreamy gauzy images reflect what feels like looking through pot haze. And edited fine enough. But the subject matter didn't warrant a movie. The people around The Doors were far more interesting than the band itself. To be honest, Jim Morrison himself seemed one dimensional. Probably just as so in real life. These are the beautiful people in life that have things thrown to them, regardless of their talent. His lyrics sucked. And the real kudos should go to Ray Manzarek who suffered this fool only because Morrison was the looks of this band.So as a 90's teen, it was a wallpaper movie to put in the background at a party. As a grown adult, this flick is unwatchable.
At the time, we all were wondering why Val didn't win an Oscar for this performance. Looking back, it would've been a very head scratching award, knowing that the empty shell of a person who believed he had the depth of a philosopher grated on the Oscar community. Today, they most likely would celebrate it.
""The Doors"" is a hollow attempt at substance when there was none to begin with.",The Doors
50,t_atzmueller,The Doors – where good music divides itself from the Justin Gagas and Lady Biebers,8,24 December 2014,"I've heard and read much criticism about Oliver Stones ""The Doors""-biopic. The shortest may have been ""I'm nobody, I'm drunk and depressed; I'm famous, I'm drunk and depressed. I'm fat, I'm drunk and depressed and I'm famous and dead"" (presumably no longer drunk and depressed). Others have criticized that Val Kilmer looks nothing like the real ""Lizard King"", or that the story adds little new to story of both band and singer. That may to an extent be all true that ""The Doors"" is an excellent film.At the same time I have to warn that is by no means an objective opinion. See, I come from a generation where the music of ""Pink Floyd"", ""The Rolling Stones"", ""The Who"" and ""The Doors"" was an integral part of growing-up. It didn't even matter that Jim Morrison had already been dead for more than 20 years. See, it was a divided time, where honest music had become scare and channels like MTV had just begun their barrage of intolerable, artificially-hyped fluff (little did we know of the horrors to still come). So there was the alternative between this Pop, some contemporary honest Rock- and Metal-acts like ""Guns N'Roses"" or ""Nirvana"", and of course the ""Golden Oldies"" from father's tape- and record-collection. This was all zealously played on the weekends and when Oliver Stones ""The Doors"" finally arrived on videotape, this too was zealously watched before, during and often after various parties. As said: Good times that stand between an objective review.How true to the fact Stones film is, let historians and people from the era decide that. Fact is, that the film captured the essence of the time, the 1960's and 70's, at least to the point where we viewers, who weren't around then, would like to envision it. We cared little about the social-upheaval of the time, the Flower-Power-movement or Vietnam; we cared about honest Rock-music, epic performances and one of the most charismatic band-leaders of the time. All this we got in both the music and the film itself. Again, it is true that Val Kilmer optically didn't look much like Morrison but the performance went far beyond anything that has since (and after) been given by many look-alike characters. Kilmer even did the unthinkable: singing most of the material himself and emulating the Lizard King to a tit. Yes, after a few moments Kilmer has convinced us that he IS Morrison, by virtues of acting, not make-up or special-effects. Indeed, a performance that would have deserved more praise and awards than it got.If there's any criticism from my side, it may be that the film is too short. Not just from a fans perspective, who would have spent some more time with Jim, Ray and the other boys (all superbly acted by all involved, included extras and cameos), but because we would have wished to learn a little more about the enigma that was Jim Morrison. Like Oliver Stone once said himself (paraphrasing here): ""A movie is two hours and you cannot condense a persons full life to two hours"". Sure, there must have been more to Morrison than the fast-living hellraiser and drunken hoodlum-poet in the movie, but more often it's what left out from a persons life rather than what's been meticulously shown that turns a life into a legend. That's a balance that Oliver Stone got just right and hence the film gets a very subjective 8/10 from me.",The Doors

Women wanted him and men wanted to be him. Away from the microphone, Jim Morrison's life was plagued by alcoholism, drug use, obsession with death, womanising, and bizarre behaviour which saw him having numerous run ins with the law. Oliver Stone does not apologise in pulling no punches and navigating through controversy in telling the psychedelic tale of Jim Morrison's short life and his band The Doors.The movie centers on Jim Morrison's life (Val Kilmer, Top Gun) as well as his fellow band members including John Densmore (Kevin Dillon, Entourage), Ray Manzarek (Kyle MacLachlan, Blue Velvet), and Robby Krieger (Frank Whaley, Pulp Fiction). The movie also depicts his relationship with Pamela Courson (Meg Ryan, Sleepless in Seattle) and Patricia Kennealy (Kathleen Quinlan, Apollo 13). As the Doors become hugely successful, Jim becomes increasingly infatuated with his own image as ""The Lizard King"" and his lifestyle descends into alcoholism and drugs. Jim Morrison also raises the ire of many club owners and managers including his own band members and friends grow weary of Jim's bizarre and confrontational behaviour as well as his tardiness for rehearsals and concerts. Jim also finds himself in hot water with the law after being arrested for obscene behaviour on stage.Val Kilmer gives one of his best performances as Jim Morrison. Their likeness is very similar to each other and Val Kilmer does the movie justice by paying tribute to a legend who's untimely death has seen his legacy immortalised. It was also surreal to watch and listen to many of the old songs being resurrected in the movie.The rest of the supporting cast rounds out the movie quite well. In particular the likable Meg Ryan was excellent as Jim Morrison's girlfriend Pamela Courson. There is an assortment of actors and actresses in small roles including Crispin Glover (Back to the Future), Kelly Hu (Cradle 2 The Grave), singer Billy Idol, Michael Madsen (Reservoir Dogs), Debi Mazar (Entourage), Michael Wincott (The Crow), Josie Bissett (Melrose Place) and Titus Welliver (Bosch).Director Oliver Stone is not one to shy away from controversy especially evidenced by movies such as Platoon (1986), Born on the Fourth of July (1989), JFK (1991) and Natural Born Killers (1994). A lot of Jim Morrison's family, close friends and even fellow band members did not appreciate the way how Jim Morrison was depicted and the movie caused a lot of upset. The Doors pays tribute to Jim Morrison and his band The Doors and this was made possible largely due to the efforts of director Oliver Stone who brought the story to life on the big screen and Val Kilmer in one of his most memorable performances showcasing his abilities as a quality actor by bringing to life the tragic tale of Jim Morrison who was destined to live a short life.7/10.",The Doors
53,TheAll-SeeingI,"A Highly Entertaining, Sensory-Driven Film",9,3 November 2019,"Granted, ""The Doors"" eschews historical precision for sensory-driven, impressionistic indulgences. This isn't a biographical deep-dive of Jim Morrison's mind, but then again, director Oliver Stone never offered that as an intention.Even the deepest-thinking rock stars carry a cartoonish projection by virtue of their chosen vocation, and this film's indulgence in dramatized character elements are true to form. Val Kilmer's performance as Morrison remains much maligned, but is absolutely in line with Hollywood's exploitations of rock n roll mythology. Kilmer inhabits the sketch with a contrived detachment directly reflective of what Stone was going for in the movie as a whole.Shot in the era in which impressionist rock videos reigned supreme, ""The Doors"" leverages those rich indulgences, and marries them with the band's remarkable, unassailable music catalog. Highly recommended, but not for those who expect to find Jim Morrison pontificating from the psychiatrist's couch. - (Was this review of use to you? If so, let me know by clicking ""Helpful.""

I watched the movie knowing about how Oliver Stone skewed the facts and changed some things around, so instead of expecting a 100% factual biography on Jim Morrison, I watched it expecting an entertaining film with great music...That's what I got.Even though the film isn't completely factual, it conveyed really well what the rock and roll was like for most rock stars. Drugs, alcohol, sex. It all happens in this film. Oliver Stone didn't really do wonders with Jim Morrison's story, but his direction style was really good with this movie. The concert scenes were done really great, and for someone who's just getting into the music, they were really great scenes to watch.The performances in this movie are something else. I'd have to say that from the Val Kilmer movies that I've seen, this is his best performance. He's really a perfect film incarnation of Jim Morrison, even if it's Oliver Stone's version of Jim Morrison. Everybody in the movie does a really good job in their roles, and it was really cool to watch.So if you want a 100% factual Jim Morrison biography, read a book.

This biography of Jim Morrison's enigmatically short career chronicles Morrison's (the confidence-inspiring Val Kilmer) rise from UCLA Film School dropout to his sheer infamy in the 1960s, the trippiest of all decades. The cast is good, especially in regards to the many cameos by the actual people from the story (example: Patricia Kennealy as a priestess).What amazes me about this movie is what would come to be its similarity to ""Alexander."" Morrison is Kilmer's Philip-- a swaggering, staggering, boozing idol. The visual style and trippy feel of the films mesh beautifully. The only thing that makes ""The Doors"" not as enjoyable is (in addition to some general weak dialogue and poor staging) its constant flashes of whiplash-inducingly random nudity. Though ""Alexander"" took the rap for being sexual, it had barely over one scene of actual sex in the movie-- but with its references, explicit content, and thunderous parade of breasts, ""The Doors"" outdoes that film.One of a great many psychedelic films worth checking out, and well worth the mere $5 price tag at a certain retail giant....",The Doors

And while that may be a bit surprising considering how this film portrays the band, this film doesn't rely on accuracy, but moreso, the artistic values of the film itself, which is an interesting approach, but one that resulted in one of the most stylish and inspired musical biopics of all time-and one that is understandably pretty divisive. At face value, this seems like any average biopic, but it focuses hard on the feelings and vibes of the era for when this film takes place, as well as the music from the Doors themselves, and it's a delight. Val Kilmer gives an Oscar worthy performance of the lizard king, and still ranks as one of the best performances in a biopic of all time. That's not to say everyone else was bad, as everyone did an excellent job in their respective roles as well, helping this movie feel that much more alive. The story is raunchy, deep, and often comical-and that's not a bad thing. It mainly goes over the crazy escapades and hijinks surrounding Jim Morrison, and does a damn good job at it; all thanks to Oliver Stone's fun and artistic direction and Val Kilmer's amazing portrayal. It almost makes you want to dislike Jim Morrison for being a drug addicted psychopath, but, after doing some research, it's important to know that this film is less about Jim Morrison himself but about his public image-which is another one of those creative liberties that, while fictional, does help the film a lot, as there's never really a dull moment to be found here (even if it inadvertently paints the lizard king in a negative light). Speaking of which, the characters are all good, whether it be the immensely talented, yet sleezy (in this movie) Jim Morrison, the rest of the band, Pamela, the weird, but likable Patricia, etc., they're all wonderful. Another thing I thought was amazing about the film was how it used the music, as it all worked with the scenes and the story of the film. It all felt purposeful, and, as a fan of the band myself, I really loved. With that said, though, the film isn't quite perfect, as the pacing is a little bit slower than it needed to be, as I feel this film, while very entertaining, dragged on in a few scenes. I think the film was trying to include a little too much exposition here and there, which, to be fair, could be because the film is presenting a whole new story that never happened until here. But, I feel like this film could've been about at least 30 mins shorter. It doesn't feel so stretched that it hampers the film too much, but it could've been better. But that's really about it. Much like the band this film was named after, this film rocks. I can understand how some may not like this film solely because of how inaccurate and disrespectful it may seem to Jim Morrison (especially since it shows him locking Pamela in a closet and burning the closet door, which then led to the house burning down-none of which, like a lot of the other events here, actually happened. Still a very well done scene), but, as a film, it's objectively excellent. It takes a legendary band and their singer, as well as the era they took place in, and instead of making something that mirrored reality, it goes far beyond it, and in doing so, made the film work. Sure, the film is sensationalized, but it runs with it, and makes for one hell of a musical biopic.",The Doors
59,talisencrw,A great time capsule of the 60's and one of Oliver Stone's finest works!,9,22 September 2016,"I KNOW I'm giving way too many stars for this, but I don't care; The Doors were one of my very first favourite groups. I fondly recall, when I was 11, and Elektra Records released 'The Doors' Greatest Hits', and the album-length version of 'Light My Fire' was played all the time on the radio, and I was mesmerized by the instrumental middle of the song, got the album from my parents for Christmas, and started a lifelong love affair with the band. Yes, Jim Morrison is highly overrated. Yes, the movie is an extremely self-indulgent mess and it can be quite incoherent and incohesive. But the Sixties, the L.A. rock scene back then, and especially Morrison's life, were just like that, so it is oh so fitting!I adore the fact that it was Oliver Stone's labour of love (one of thankfully many) and that the surviving members of the band basically had full input. I would take this and 'Talk Radio' (my personal favourite Stone's throw) over a hundred of Stone's politically over-the-top movies any day!When I was 17, I took my life savings and visited, on my own, nine European countries, including France and its capital, Paris. Did I go for the Eiffel Tower, wild romance on Richard Linklater-esque trains, or its outstanding magic and sidewalk cafes? No--train-wise I had to put up with a stupid labour strike, such that an overnight sleeper car from Berne, Switzerland to Paris had to be switched, in the middle of the night, FOUR times, just so they could prove a point. And it was just to see Morrison's grave. I met 20 fantastic people who had made the pilgrimage from all over the world, and it was my first time having red wine and smoking pot. The graffiti and the sculpture of him, in the Pere Lachaise cemetery, were fascinating, as was his life. Would I go through that again? Of course I would.It's Val Kilmer's best work by a mile. The film just oozes charisma and breathes life--just as the band's work must have done back in the day. Worth a purchase and re-watches (I watch it each year on Jim's birthday and accidentally bought it twice), for any fan of 60's music or its culture. A bonafide classic when Stone was actually really something.",The Doors
60,ajkbiotech,I am the Lizard King; I can do anything !,10,10 May 2021,"This magnum opus directed by Oliver Stone and starring Val Kilmer, who inhabits the Mr Mojo Risin character like a second skin, is spot on and captures fully the Doors as well as the mystique of the Lizard King himself, James Douglas Morrison aka Jim Morrison, poet, singer, and ultimate sex symbol of not just 1967-71, but posthumously for decades.My wife thinks Morrison is the sexiest rock star of all time.I'm certain many women share that view.This film is far from perfect but in its two odd hours it captures the Doors rise to fame better than any book, documentary or other media could. It is truly a masterpiece and Kilmer's acting is at a level beyond genius.A film I rewatch just about every year.",The Doors
61,aleksanderk-95350,Great performance from Val Kilmer.,4,1 May 2021,"Val Kilmer does an amazing job as Jim Morrison. He even did his own singing in the film. Which I find very impressive, he sounded very similar to Jim Morrison. Unfortunately the rest of the film suffers. For having a long runtime they waste a lot of it. Instead of explaining how some of these amazing songs are written. Or giving more depth to the other band mates. They waste time showing, Jim Morrison doing drugs and having a twenty minute long sex scene. These scenes showing his excess could have been shorter. Film had potential, with some tweaks could have been great.",The Doors
62,santiagocosme,If it wasn't for the soundtrack...,5,15 March 2015,"First off, this review comes about 20 years too late. Yep! That's how much time has passed since this movie was released. At the time, Val Kilmer was actually popular. I wonder how many teenagers have actually heard of him now The Doors is one of my favorite bands of all time, and the opening song of the movie, Riders on the storm still remains my favorite song. So, when the movie started with this tune, I really thought there could not be a better start. Regrettably, everything was less and less interesting after that. I get that Jim Morrison was a unique, crazy, and incomprehensible person. A man who seemed to lead a life with one only goal: to find death sooner rather than later. But not being able to understand this man doesn't mean that I should not be able to make sense of the movie. Yes, we get to see what Jim Morrison was probably like. But the movie is called ""The Doors"", and I would have wanted to find out a lot more about the other members of the band who were also unique musicians. They composed one of the greatest albums in the history of music in 6 days, and that part of their story, is what I really wanted to hear about. Unfortunately, Oliver Stone thought that dedicating 6 minutes to this subject was more than enough. Shame!As a Doors fan, I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy the concert parts and listening to what is obviously an amazing soundtrack, but as for the story telling, I thought it was mediocre at best. There's a reason why this movie is completely forgotten. Because, it just wasn't good enough.",The Doors
63,erwan_ticheler,Ode To A Grasshopper,9,28 June 2003,"Oliver Stone's biography of Jim Morrison(it says Doors but it's about Morrison)is very well done.The music of The Doors is sublime and most of their greatest songs are woven into this movie.Highlight to me is the performance of ""The End"",their best song(also the best psychedelic song ever written).The intensity of the song and the acting performance of Val Kilmer makes this scene brilliant. Other highlights are the scene in ""The Factory"" of Andy Warhol,with even better music of The Velvet Underground in the background and the stage brawls with the cops(GO JIM GO).Stone shows us that America wasn't ready for The Doors at that time in history and probably still aren't,considering the popularity of the religious and highly old fashioned psycho George W. Bush.Still,The Doors and especially Jim Morrison are part of America's (music)history and it is hard to denie that.An almost masterpiece of one of the greatest bands and performer of music history.  9/10",The Doors
64,myronlearn,The Bores,3,10 March 2021,"Disjointed, loud and overacted by Kilmer make this film a big waste of time. It's a terrible tribute to Morrison, what he created and represented. Too many superfluous characters clutter the movie and make it more confusing. Kilmer was miscast. This should have been a whole lot better.",The Doors
65,MF210,A compelling but seriously flawed film,7,13 January 2006,"My Rating: **1/2 out of ****.One thing you can say about Oliver Stones The Doors is that Stone has no intention of forcing the audience to like the main character. Stone spends almost the entire 138 minutes making Jim Morrison into the biggest asshole that he possibly can. Really, when I first rented this film I had no idea what to expect since Oliver Stone is sort of hit-or-miss with me. I can honestly say the film held my attention completely but at the end I was unsatisfied with what I had seen.The remaining members of The Doors have criticized this film saying that it only portrayed one side of Morrison and that some of the actions in the film were far worse than anything he ever did (throwing the TV in the studio for instance). To be honest, I felt exactly the same way. By the end I was like, ""There has to be more to this man than this!!!!""."" I know Morrison had drinking and drug problems, and thats on full display. Stone makes clear that we see the flaws of Morrison and pretty much nothing else. If Stone wanted to make a film that showed the dark side of a rock star than he accomplished his goal admirably.But the film is just too disappointingly shallow. Morrison was supposedly a very shy front-man at first which we actually do see in the beginning when he sings with his back turned toward the audience. It's a shame Stone didn't explore this ""shy, intelligent"" man that the Doors always talk about instead of the sadistic asshole on display here. If Stone had made Morrison into a more well-rounded character than this could have been a great film.What cannot be criticized about the film is Val Kilmer's electrifying performance. Forget the small little flaws like Kilmer is six inches taller than Morrison was and that Kilmers face is a little fatter than Morrisons and just watch this magnificent piece of acting. I have never been that impressed with Val Kilmer's acting ability before I saw this film so seeing him in this was a mindblowing experience. He completely inhabits Morrison and its hard to believe he was actually the second choice for the role. This will undoubtedly be a career best for Kilmer and it is a damn shame he didn't at least get an Oscar Nomination.The supporting cast is also impressive, particularly Meg Ryan. Ryan excels much more in lighter roles but here she dos a very good job as Morrison's girlfriend, Pamela Courson. Kevin Dillon, Kyle MacLachlan, and Frank Whaley do the best they can with limited screen time as the remaining members of The Doors.Stone's films have always been uneven when it comes to visual styles. In such films as Natural Born Killers, Any Given Sunday, and to some extent, Nixon, they have been exercises of cinematic masturbation with hyper editing and completely unnecessary film stock switches. Fortunately, thats not the case here as the film has a more straightforward look that complements the film well instead of distracting us.Stone can make a compelling film and The Doors is never boring. It has a lot of good points: a tremendous lead performance, impressive supporting work, effective cinematography, and a great soundtrack. Its a shame that the film is hampered by a shallow script. If the script were better it is quite possible The Doors could have been a great film. As it stands, its a compelling, though definitely disappointing film.",The Doors
66,headly66,A sloppy overacted mess of a movie,3,11 March 2010,"I saw The Doors in 1991 when it came out and remember so wanting it to be good because I was a big Doors fan and I guess like most fans knew all the music and poems and facts of the bands history. I was disappointed at the time but I think I even forced myself to believe it was a better film then I remembered because I wanted it to be. Now years later I watch it again and it has to be one of the worst biographies I have ever seen.Jim Morrison did not act this way, he did not walk around speaking in song lyrics and acting like a buffoon. Jim was a likable intelligent guy who mostly acted for the camera, he was a very calculated person and nothing like the stage Jim in his personal life. Stone portrays him as some whack job who only wants to take acid all day long and never gets into the dark side of his life without making it seem like a cartoon and shows us nothing of the creation of his music. The singing and over acting by Kilmer is atrocious, the costumes and scenery all look fake. Did they even look at a picture of Morrison? What's with the hair in the beginning? We learn nothing of the history of the other band members, Pamela was not on the scene until way after they became a band and the use of their own music throughout the movie seems really unnecessary and takes away from it feeling like the time period, especially when we hear songs that would not come out until years later. The montage of them in the hippie scene at Haight Ashbury is embarrassing.I wish someone would make a real Doors film in a serious manner and explore the music better.",The Doors
67,Scaramouche2004,Morrison Lives,8,26 August 2005,"I am a lover of all things Rock. My Love stretches from the Beatles to Led Zep, from The Who to Guns and Roses and beyond. But one of the bands I find most intriguing and complex is The Doors.They were around only for a very short time, however despite their drug fuelled lives and the chaotic times in which they lived them, they managed to cut six studio albums in just four years, and all of them pretty damn good.Here director Oliver Stone, attempts to bring the legacy of Jim Morrison and The Doors to the big Screen, and succeeds admirably in capturing the era, the man, the band and their music.In an act of perfect miracle casting, Val Kilmer walks the walk and talks the talk as self destructive Morrison, a man slowly being destroyed by his own genius. The character of Morrison was one of the main factors that drew me to The Doors in the first place.Morrison was as previously stated, a genius. He was a poet, a philosopher and one of the most charismatic and recognisable figures of the late sixties. This power to reach out to people, was however tarnished, by his self abusive and volatile behaviour. Behaviour that not only lost Morrison and The Doors friends, fans and intellectual credibility, but also cost Morrison his life at the painfully tragic age of just 27 from heart failure, brought about quite obviously by years of excessive drug and alcohol abuse.Kilmer, shows Morrison in a 'warts and all' kind of way. In the early scenes of the film, We see the rising young, talented and self taught philosopher, discussing with his future keyboardist his visions of putting his deep and powerful messages to music...to reach the masses, and as the film progresses we slowly see the light of that glowing mind get dimmer and dimmer as it slowly suffocates under the pressures of his fame, and the sedative influence of his increasing substance abuse forcing his talent, his music and his life to spiral irreparably out of control.It amazes me how one person with such an incredible intelligence could have destroyed himself so stupidly and needlessly. He was however a product of a difficult time in history, which I suppose must have played a big part in shaping Jim into the kind of person he eventually became.One of the best Biopics I have have ever seen on any subject and one served up with a big slice of gritty realism that only Oliver Stone truly knows how to prepare.",The Doors
68,wavecat13,As good a Doors movie as we will ever see,8,5 September 2018,"This film has been hit with a lot of criticism over the years. I guess that with a group as controversial and beloved as the Doors, there are always going to be points of disagreement. And there were things that rubbed me the wrong way too, like casting pleasant Meg Ryan as Pamela Courson, who in some accounts was no sweetheart. And the Morrison death scene too, which most likely came from a heroin overdose - but there is no sign of that in the film. (I'm no Doors expert btw, but I have read a few things here and there.) But for my money, this is as powerful and exciting a dramatized version of their story as we are ever going to see. The cinematography and production are first rate, and Kilmer is very convincing as Morrison.",The Doors
69,bazdol,GREAT FILM MAKING,8,3 March 1999,"Although quite self indulgent Oliver Stone again shows his great film making techniques. Loosely based on ""Rock God"" Jim Morrison, Stone integrates superb editing, music, choreography, even animal noises to produce tremendous effect.  In the blood/sex scene,  for example, which Stone sets up with the previous news conference scene, the wild choreographed sex orgy dance is put to the music of Orff's ""Carmana Burana."" The floating minicam is well used by him in a number of episodes.Who would have thought that MS.

70,fostrhod,"I am the lizard king, I drink a lot.",5,2 June 2021,"I saw this film on its release in1991 and being a massiveDoors fan at the time (hasn't every male had fantasies of being a Jim Morrison figure at some point) I felt that the film was over blown and bloated,- a bit like Morrison in his later years. I didn't rate it all, the music is amazing, likewise the concert footage in fact anytime you hear the Doors music the film comes alive. When it crashes is anytime in which the mythology of Morrison is laid bare. Let's face it he was a very insecure drunk who wrote bad poetry. Is the film any good? Yes it's great but only if you don't know anything about The Doors. So
watching the film a fresh after 30 years I think it is a great film and works well as a primer for the Doors music, but overall and it's purely down to Morrison and Courson ( his put upon girlfriend) being such unlikable people I have to say it's not likeable, ironically it's immensely enjoyable but I didn't like it. Ps Val Kilmer is great.",The Doors
71,Kakueke,"Film chains, tho its eyes lie some",8,21 October 2001,"As a big Doors fan who is interested in the background of The Doors as well as their great music (tho, I have no problem in admitting, not as much), I am sympathetic to Ray Manzarek's criticisms about the failure of Oliver Stone's film to focus on Jim Morrison's better side, not to say there was not a very bad one.  He was extremely well versed in literature and poetry, and this is itself, as well as its contribution to Doors' lyrics, should have been presented, and it clearly could have been done so effectively. (Doors fans out there, you know about Jim's well-known [to people like us] challenge to pick up any literary book on his shelf and test him.)  And I certainly would not care if the result were a longer movie, rather than cuts in other scenes; I would remain riveted from start to finish to a 30-hour movie about the Doors.  Jim as the jerk is no-holds-barred throughout the film, but it is said that he could be intelligent and sensitive when he was not drunk, so why not make all this a first-half (or first-third) focus followed by a second-half degeneration?But a film's role is to entertain, and The Doors does not fall short, starting with a beyond-excellent acting performance by Val Kilmer as Jim. There certainly was accuracy in what one SAW of Jim, if not a fully balanced character portrayal.  Looks, mannerisms, physiognomy, voice and inflection, lip syncing and singing, anything relevant to being convincing--they were all here and on an Oscar level, altho the film world would never have let that be.  Meg Ryan was more convincing in her role as Pam than she was in any other movie in which I have seen her.  The editing could have been better, but the cinematography was fabulous, dazzling and chromatic, with great concert scenes.  (And I do not care whether those nude dancing girls hardly ever or never actually happened.)  The song selection was excellent. I thought the Indian scenes in the car crash and desert, the Whiskey-a-Go-Go scene, New Haven and Miami, the ""Celebration of the Lizard"" footage, etc. were all well done.  And its fine to have some crazy stuff (I won't give examples, to avoid spoilers)--if he did not do it, you know, it is close, or something he easily could have done.I am a stickler for accuracy in life -- in writing, in quoting other people, etc.  But in movies, is not the most important thing whether the inaccuracy causes a meaningful, substantive distortion?  Thus, the ""higher"" extra emphasis on Ed Sullivan--who cares, it was fun; the ""Come on Buick Light my Fire""; the UCLA film scene, which did not really make him look like a Hitler lover (but I admit I was bugged by ""I quit"", which did not happen); composite Patricia Kennealy; the presentation of Andy Warhol.  Where there was substantive inaccuracy, as I said before, was in an unbalanced portrayal of Jim--the lack of the literary side (and I'm sure, some other positive qualities).  Perhaps some day we will see that on film, not just books.8 of 10",The Doors

Or just a very damaged trouble maker?,7,31 March 2020,"Forth most, telling this tale of Jim Morrison, it's about an artist, an actual true poet of the modern age, a wild and tormented soul and perhaps a true seeker of existential truth. It's also about the 60s and 70s hippie culture and music.Val Kilmer does a pretty good performance. Meg Ryan is good too, well worth mentioning. And it's amazing how Kilmer almost sounds as Jim Morrison when he sings. It's about sex, drugs and rock n roll, and a little love and romance too. It's also about the rise from the nobody to fame and fortune. It's about the dynamics within a band group. It's about a piece of cultural history of the modern age.It's a pretty good film. I saw the directors cut, which is almost 2 and a half hour, and enjoyed the entire ride of the movie. Though it did get a bit boring at times and sometimes felt didn't really have that much of a point. But sure, Jim Morrison was a very interesting individual, his life and persona is well worth to try to tell a story about. As those larger then life characters are always good fun, especially when their based on real people. And Morrison was perhaps a bit crazy, but he was also very real. That's what I think anyway. This movie is very much worth seeing if you're into the music scene of the 60s and 70s.

It's hard to place my finger on specifics, but I would have expected better.The movie made me so sad. Jim and I were born in the same year. I was in California in the 60's. I understand that time ... yet it makes me very sad. Such a great talent, totally consumed by alcohol and other drugs.

81,Manthorpe,The Lizard King,9,17 June 2004,"We all know how legendary The Doors were and still are, and sooner or later someone was going to make a film about them. Might as well be Oliver Stone. Given the subject matter, Stone was able to go off the deep end with his imagery here to the point of making one have an epileptic seizure OR think they just dropped some acid. Either way, it's great to watch in my book.The film is flawed in that it's not titled correctly. It's not about The Doors, it's about Jim Morrison and basically just the wild and crazy side of him. That's ok I guess, Morrison was The Doors. Many have criticized Stone for not depicting Jim in the proper light, but given how many people knew him it had to be an almost impossible task to please everyone as everyone knew him differently. I think we all can attest to this through the friendships we have with our friends. Some know us as one way, and some know us as another. I respect Stone for trying and feel sorry for him about the flak people have given him as I know he is a very talented director. I think his intentions were spawned out of true admiration and that he made this film for himself and to pay tribute, and not to win any awards. More of this can be found on the Special Edition DVD from Stone himself.
Even if one does not enjoy the trippy qualities of the film such as I do, or any part for that matter, one could not avoid admitting how well Val Kilmer portrays Morrison. It's simply amazing and is one of the best performances that I can bring to mind, and is the best example of how to literally become someone else, bar none. He doesn't act like he's Jim Morrison, he becomes Jim Morrison. He is Jim Morrison. This is no doubt helped by the uncanny facial similarities the two have. Not only that, most of the singing that's in the film was done by Kilmer himself and even a few of the original band members admitted that they honestly could not tell the difference between their two voices. Even if you hate Val Kilmer, this performance jumps in your face and screams for respect while trying to strangle you.As mentioned earlier, some do not like the film for several reasons. One is that it makes Jim look like a monster and that it only glorifies his wild and uninhibited behavior. Two is that it's basically just one big acid trip into bits of history about the band. For one, Oliver Stone said it best....when you have to condense a person's life, a legend at that, into two measly hours you must take the highlights. Everyone lives longer than two hours, even Jim. We all know Jim was crazy, and with so many of the insane stories Stone heard while trying to piece together the script for this, a lot of what he heard was simply what you see. The wild and crazy side. As a result, what we're left with is not an accurate depiction of The Doors or of Jim Morrison. It is entertaining, yes, but it is not accurate. I think it could have been done perfectly, but it would have been excruciatingly difficult...and still not everyone would like it. And as far as the trippiness of the film, well that's Oliver Stone for you. We saw the same thing in Natural Born Killers a few years later. I personally like the style of it and felt that it was in place here but that's just my opinion. The '60's, drugs, and rock and roll equals trippy.Overall a decent attempt at one of the most difficult subjects to cover, legends. And even though it's not entirely accurate and even though Morrison is one of my idols and he deserved a little better, I do enjoy the film greatly. The film should have been named Pandora's Box.",The Doors

A true genius Morrison read everything he got his hands on and memorized it books became his only friends.His only true friends in school remember him as a risk taker and a practical joker. The teachers Hated him Because Morrison Had been more well read then them and always thought outside the box. I time he became a Rebel against the system testing people Always testing them. Morrison became interested in film and went to The film school at UCLA there he met Ray Manzerek a Man that became his best friend and mentor . Thru Ray Morrison met Robby Kriger and John Densmore after Morrison read his poetry to Ray on a beach in Venice California after quitting film school Morrison spent a year on a friends roof top taking drugs and writing poetry. To Ray these sounded like songs. The popular line is Ray told Jim let's start a band and make a million bucks and Morrison replied I already have a name for it THE DOORS. That part is true. Morrison was influenced by the works of Huxley and the poems of William Blake took the line if the Doors of perception were cleared everything would appear as it is infinite. Together They created a revolution that is still felt today. The Myths of Jim Morrison are great stories but they eclipse the Actual Jim Morrison. The Jim Morrison that actually was a nice guy that cared about his fans and loved his friends and had a problem in Drugs and booze. The Drugs and Booze twisted Morrison into a bizarre parody of himself. A Morrison that slept with every woman that crossed his path and caught his eye. Yet a Morrison that was hopelessly in love with Pam Courson. They had a stormy and chaotic relationship as the movie indicates. But each was the love of the other's life. Morrison was also a first rate poet and a first rate singer. A fact that gets overlooked by his looks and his body. A fact he hated which is why in his later years Morrison became fat and bearded trying to destroy the sex god image. Oliver Stone touches on all of this and he gives us the myths trying to look like facts. and he omitted a lot. But it's a two hour long movie and Stone had to omit a lot but add in Indians and Foretelling Morrison's death. But the movie itself never suffers from that. In fact the movie is a steady roller coaster ride. Going from one extreme to the next that by the time it ends you just sit back and go Wow. And man does this movie make me miss Jim Morrison. I never knew him but it makes me wonder .What heights could this man have reached If he had still been alive. The possibilities are endless. Or maybe it was a merciful act by fate to take the Lizard King so early. Either Way the movie is a powerhouse keg of dynamite. As for Val Kilmer I've just one question. How the Hell did he NOT get nominated for his portrayal of Jim Morrison ? He should have been and Won the Oscar. His portrayal is simply that powerful. A Incredible movie by any means of the imagination.,The Doors
83,e-m-hobo,Unapologetic,9,21 May 2021,"A film about a man that best described himself as a ""clown,"" if the story of the movie ring true, meaning he considered himself to be a caricature of what he set out to be. He wanted to bring change, but instead got stuck in his own broken self instead of breaking through boundaries offering freedom and insight.The story rapidly goes from a glimpse of him as a kid witnessing a terrible accident to diving into the excess and the social pressures associated with it, also pressing those that set out to avoid the excess into the same lifestyle. Jim repeatedly gets his loved ones, his girlfriend that had the status of being his wife, his bandmates, into doing drugs against their choice.Through the drugs and alcohol abuse as well as the continuously adulterous lifestyle that he pursues and presses his girlfriend into, they head down a road of self destruction and frequent dispair. The film for as far as I can tell honestly sets out to illustrate why and how Jim Morrison wrecked himself and others, offering us a clear glimpse into what spawned quite a few of The Doors' lyrics, to my surprise, not all written by him.The few poems I've read by his hand were abstract, awful, and playing into what went around at the time into things you might want to experience. They introduce mistaken notions of insight and experience as various meditative religions would preach them based on what he saw through his drugged perception of reality. The few I've read were really basic and awful.This movie contrasts very well what The Doors, including Jim Morrison, produced that was pristine with that what wasn't. It also honestly shows how he could go off the rails, which I knew he could do through live recordings of him playing with Jimi Hendrix.Should het get kicked off the stage for what he said? Nope. It's art. If the story of Oedipus hadn't been written, we wouldn't know of it. You do need to consider that in terms of excess, although he didn't engage the least bit in incest, this movie displays quite a lot of questionable behavior, choosing lust over love and morals.Great movie, but I felt a bit uncomfortable with some of the flash forwards or backs, for instance between a fat and a skinny Jim Morrison, which made me question whether it was supposed to be a flash forward flashback kind of thing, or a bit sloppy. I'm a bit absent minded (no, not absinth minded) so I might have to watch it again.",The Doors
84,Tetsel,Stone Successful In Creating Atmosphere of The Doors,7,5 November 1998,"Jim Morrison was dead long before I was born, yet I can still feel his angst through his music. I can relate to many of his songs, and I'm not even a drug user. The key to his magic is the atmosphere the songs create. Oliver Stone, who grew up with The Doors, recreates this atmosphere so well that I sometimes feel stoned myself from just watching the film! I don't know if it is accurate, and knowing Stone, it probably isn't. But then again, I don't care. The mood of the film brought through the feeling of what it must have been like to be with The Doors during that rebellious and experimental time. It takes a great talent to transfer the attitude of one decade to another 30 years later. Val Kilmer was absolutely MAGNIFICENT as Morrison, and it only helps that of all living actors he is by FAR the closest look alike to Morrison.

This film isn't concerned with either of those things, rather its more to do with perpetuating a Rock & Roll myth and being probably the greatest ""music video"" ever created. Understand that I don't mean either of those things as insults. Rock myths are great entertainment and I love the music of The Doors so seeing wonderful images set to those songs is great fun. The cinematography is top notch, filled with over saturated nostalgic tones of some wonderful 60's California dream. This aspect of the film more than any other seems to perpetuate the notion that this is all myth and not a document. Val Kilmer as the quintessential rock god himself Jim Morrison is amazing. He is such a delight to behold one could easily see why you would just want to watch the film for the pleasure of witnessing his wonderful performance. There is also something to be said of the fact that he is (seemingly) performing the vocals in the songs himself.

Central cast [Meg Ryan, Frank Whaley, Kyle MacLaclan, Kevin Dillon as Jim's wife and the rest of the Doors] is perfect, as are the odd compilation of supporting players: Mimi Rogers, Kathleen Quinlan, the always-whacked-out Crispin Glover as Andy Warhol, and bit parts by Michael Madsen, Jennifer Rubin, Will Jordan, Paul Williams, etc.The only flaw I can see [from Stone] is the ending [featuring real-life Doors drummer John Densmore], which makes it seem as if Morrison is still alive...As if. 3.5 of 4 Niro~Stars",The Doors

Like Gary Oldman's spot-on performance as Beethoven in Immortal Beloved, Kilmer has us believing we are watching Jim Morrison himself throughout this film. He channels the quirky and inscrutable showman brilliantly, in full color. Kilmer is absolutely stunning in this film. Incredible.

I was completely engrossed the entire way through, and I think that there was never one moment where I wanted the drug-crazed thrill ride to end. I had never previously heard of The Doors, but guess what I'm doing as I write this very review? Listening to their music.I loved the hedonistic craziness of those concerts, to the point that I felt like I was there myself through the entire film. I loved the visuals of the film, with it really transporting you into the haze of 60's LA that defined the tone of the movie. The cinematography, the visual language, the tone, everything about the movie made me feel nostalgic for a time I had never experienced.Oh, and there was the music - as I previously mentioned, I had never actually heard of the Doors, nor really been that into classic rock, but every time the opening chords of music played across the screen, an immeasurably wide smile spread across my face. I just loved the beautifully smooth, yet simultaneously wild, music that carried the entire movie, and it amazes me that I actually cannot tell the difference between Val Kilmer singing in the movie and Jim Morrison's actual songs.This movie will have you cheering along with the crowds on screen and enthralled from start to finish.

93,abyoussef,"""a far out trip with the lizard king, but...""",6,18 October 2003,"by Dane Youssef""Ray Manzarek turned down Stone's many requests to help in the movie. Manzarek has since said that the movie is a horrible account of the history of the band."" --FROM IMDb triviaGee, I wish he had participated.Stone's ""The Doors"" is a film that loves ""the lizard king's"" stage presence. And the poetic and haunting music he left behind.Stone weaves magnificent unworldly music with mind-blowing visuals, joining the sound and look of two worlds together. We see what the inside of Morrison must've really been like.But seems to have little to no interest in who the rest of ""The Doors"" really were.There is a moment in this film where Morrison is mugging into the camera, making sexy, seductive smiles, cute little pouts and angry-tiger faces for a photographer. Morrison is a Greek sex god as well as a rock god.The photographer tells him: ""You don't need those guys. YOU'RE the talent. You're the one they want. YOU ARE the doors.""She's not the only one who thinks so. A manager who sees them performing at a club says the same thing, offering Morrison a gig if he drops those ""others."" HE'S THE TALENT, he tells Morrison.Many agree with this, apparently and especially Oliver Stone himself, who focuses ENTIRELY about Morrison at his best (and worst) and makes every sequence is this movie a drugged-out trip into the lizard-king's idol status and pin-up persona.The problem--that's ALL this movie seems to be about.Stone may have misnamed this film ""The Doors."" Perhaps he should have named it ""This Is The End: Life & Fast-Times of Jim Morrison."" Morrison was dead by 27, thanks to all the hard work, talent and success to get him there.Morrison truly is the entire focus of Stone's film, perhaps because he was the true mastermind behind it all. Perhaps Morrison truly was ""The Doors.""The rest of the band's stories--from THEIR point of view. What were they about? The movie seems to be made by someone who loved the music and hated the man. Despised him. By the time Morrison moves on to harder drugs, he has gone from a sensitive soulful poet to a raving and destructive monster.The drugs'll do that, you know.Morrison was actually a sweet, deep, thoughtful and sensitive man. Not to mention very shy and humble. But his art wasn't really much until he started using drugs to fuel his creative fires. Like Hendrix, Cobin, Joplin, the narcotics gave him musical genius and inspiration.Himself, especially. He hurts his girlfriend every way he can, he infuriates the other members of the band, he misses rehearsals and performances (well, actually, sometimes he shows up late). If you've ever seen a backstage band biopic, you know how everything will play out. Passionate, talented kids meet, unique, fresh and with big ideas, the group comes together, they make it big, the seduction of the fame, the money, the power, the sex... and they undo themselves until they're sitting in a pool of their own filth and sick in a state of depression and anger.Well actually, once again, in this case, that's just Morrison. Most of the band just backs him up and just gets angrier and angrier by his steady stream of destruction. He inhales every drug and woman he can and starts to harm everyone who crosses his path, including himself, so he can ""break on through to the other side."" Effective, but I wish Stone had taken the focus off this for just a little while.I would have liked some digging into the rest of the band--the history, the bonding, the feelings there. Who they all were. He doesn't even scratch the surface there.The best of this, I suppose, is when Morrison takes his girlfriend and the band on a peyote-fulled trip out to the desert. They bond over fantasies and nightmares, planning the future---and unraveling. What's going to happen to them?Val Kilmer gives perhaps the best performance of his life. He looks like Morrison, as well as sings just like him (rumor had it the real-life band could not tell the difference between Morrison and Kilmer's vocals). He also prances around the stage with as much perverse, energy, fire and gusto as Morrison ever did. He's larger and bigger than life. He captures all the little things about Morrison, as well as the big ones. He has his soul. He does not impersonate Morrison, he possesses him. Perfectly.But a little of Jim goes a long, long, long way. Stone doesn't seem perturbed and keeps laying it on. I got the wild image of Morrison early on and I would've liked to know more about this poet's soul.""They want my dick, not my words,"" he remarks sadly.Other performances are strong, with Kyle MacLachlan as Morrison's truest believer and band-keyboardist (""Twin Peaks"" and ""Showgirls""), Frank Whaley as guitarist Robby Krieger (""Swimming with Sharks,"" ""Jimmy Show"" and ""Homage""), Meg Ryan, Billy Idol and Kevin Dillion. They don't really shine, but then they're all never really allowed to. It's all Kilmer's show as Morrison---like the real ""Doors""?Apparently, the movie seems to think so. By the end of the film, of course, Morrison has died--of course. It plays out not so much like a tragedy as really the best thing for everybody (especially Morrison himself--he's finally achieved his dream).Kilmer's performance, the Door's music and Stone's crazy LSD-eyed view make this movie really worth seeing... it's all like a crazy three-month long trip while The Doors are blasting all the time---Morrison at the center of it all. Still blowing everyone away with this fire...Still, I recommend the film. But be forewarned--this is the life of Jim Morrison... ""Pretty pretentious, Stone.""by Dane Youssef",The Doors
94,morpheusatloppers,Stone infects The Doors...,1,4 March 2009,"Oliver Stone's Vietnam War movies are supposed to be authentic - 'cos he was like, THERE, man.And yet his biopic of The Doors portrays the incident where Ed Sullivan's minions ask Jim Morrison to change the word ""higher"" during his live performance of ""Light My Fire"", due to its drug connotations.Jim agrees, but of course fails to do so. All true.However, in Stone's film, Morrison looks rebelliously, nay PETULANTLY (Jim was NEVER petulant) into camera and SHOUTS the offending word. Very dramatic.Except that I happen to HAVE the original Ed Sullivan Show performance on VT - and Jim sings the word with NO special emphasis whatsoever.Which begs the question that if Olly couldn't stick to the (well known) facts with a biopic, what price the credibility of his Vietnam War movies?",The Doors
95,salmineo,A CLASSIC! THE KING OF ROCK MUSICALS!,10,22 March 2004,"Oliver Stone's ""The Doors"" remains the King Kong of rock musicals! A big budgeted, bigger than life depiction of the legendary rock band, it also captures a very realistic view of the late 1960's. Val Kilmer gives his greatest performance as the late, Jim Morrison, giving such an increadible performance, at times you forget it really isn't Jim. He certainly should have been nominated for an Oscar. Sadly, Val Kilmer has never been able to give a performance as great as this one, with his career recently sliding into limited release feature films that haven't given him a box office hit in many years. The entire cast here is great, although Meg Ryan's cheeky, giggly persona didn't do the character of Pamela proper justice. Meg is cute, but never has really been a deep artistic actress. I think she was mis-casted in this role. The concert sequences are nothing short of amazing, and the visual effects used throughout the film are breath taking. This movie takes you on a non-stop roller coaster ride trip back in time. And will remain a cult classic. This movie is heavy sex, drugs, and rock and roll, no holds barred.

96,consortpinguin,"Like, That's the way things were, man!",8,21 June 2001,"""The Doors"" is a really cool movie, man!  Yeah, like back in the sixties there were hippies and they took a lot of drugs and booze and stuff.  And, like Jim Morrison lived in the clouds, y'know?  He made some great music and he liked being the bad boy of Rock.  He never cared about tomorrow.This is a good movie, cause, like it tells it like it was, man.  Like, Jim wasn't ""just plain folks"" y'know he like did his own thing.  This flick re-creates the whole scene in that surrealistic kinda way that it all happened.   Oliver Stone made brilliant use of video techniques to blend the story and the music. I lived through the sixties in high school and college.  I was a ""Straight"" but there were a lot of ""hips"" all over the place, y'know and a few times kids actually lit up a J right in class.   Some of the kids walked about three feet above the sidewalk.  I didn't approve of everything that went on -- being around people like that only reinforced my resolve to stay away from drugs.  The majority of students were straights, but just about everyone dug the Doors' music.The student newspaper was radical and there were some other reeeeeeaaaly far out publications.  We had some great concerts on campus, but unfortunately we never had the Doors.  A few times there were confrontations between the hippies and ROTC cadets.   Once we even had a student sit-in.  Ah, the good old days!  The Doors' music IS the Sixties and Val Kilmer IS Jim Morrison.

97,JoshuaMLosapio,Spellbinding,8,26 November 2019,"When I first saw ""The Doors"" as a teenager, I didn't like it. While I appreciated Oliver Stone's direction and Val Kilmer's performance as Jim Morrison, I felt that the overall movie was an empty, emotionless exercise in visual style. But having revisited the movie some years later I find myself converted: ""The Doors"" is a spellbinding exploration of one of the greatest rock bands of all time. Stone avoids making a conventional biopic by focusing on the troubled psyche of Jim Morrison, and how his inner demons produced brilliant music while sending him on a downward spiral that culminated in his death at the age of 27.I don't always agree with Oliver Stone's political opinions: I believe Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone and I have little sympathy for Vladimir Putin. But there's no denying that Stone is a filmmaking genius who's directed some of the greatest movies of the past 35 years - my favorite is ""Nixon,"" the best movie ever made about politics. ""The Doors"" is masterfully directed by Stone, who recreates Morrison's concerts so realistically you feel like you're up there on stage with him. In a masterstroke, Stone structures the movie's poetic, avant-garde imagery around The Doors' finest music - resulting in what feels like an extended music video that deconstructs the myth of Jim Morrison. Stone shows why Morrison was such a compelling icon of rock music while also highlighting his darker side, making for an incredible viewing experience.I'd be lying if I said that I'm usually a fan of Val Kilmer as an actor (let's just say he's not my favorite Batman) but I was awestruck by his performance as Morrison. Not only does Kilmer exactly look and sound like Morrison, he totally inhabits the role and frankly I'm surprised that Kilmer didn't receive an Oscar nomination. I really enjoyed ""The Doors"" this second time around, but I still have a few problems with it. I don't think Stone handles Morrison's death particularly well: I was expecting more emotional resonance than that was conveyed in the final film. I also would've liked to have seen more emphasis on the other members of The Doors, as well as Morrison's childhood and his relationship with his father. But despite these qualms not only did I like ""The Doors,"" I'm surprised by how much I liked it. 8/10.",The Doors

However, there is a spiritual dimension throughout the movie in the form of the image of an Indian shaman (medicine man).The movie is over 2 hours long but held my interest as it wove together the complex tapestry that was Morrison's short life.

He had so many addictions and so much confusion that it was the end of him when it came down to it. His songs were poetic, strange and brilliant but beyond the comprehension of most.

I like Oliver stone's style, his rapid and intoxicating sweeps intended to not just entice you, it enshrouds you. But as with JFK, he takes dangerous license with real people and events. Val Kilmer's Morrison was spot on, that is before Stone got through with him. The Doors is told through the perspective of Morrison, but in this film Oliver Stone makes him out to be a dysfunctional poet in a cloud of perpetual haze, so stoned, so drunk, so wasted, he can't even stand up straight. That's not the real Morrison. It was a part of him, but the film makes it about him. Jim Morrison was much more cogent and functional than Stone's caricaturization. The entire movie, in fact, became more about Morrison's drug induced neurosis than about The Doors. I felt Stone was pushing too hard to deliver his message through a prism of false perception and amplified through a distorted, almost irritating, cosmic psychedelia. It lacked anchors and believable people. The film is a buffet of hyperbolic drivel punctuated with some really good scenes and awesome concert footage. The Navajo were quite cool, however.

At best its the story of a mediocre writer who develops a problem with alcohol at worst it's a piece of utter fiction and very bad fiction. People here are giving this movie 10 out of 10 with an obnoxious title like "" mr mojo rising!"" Or "" "" Morrison was a god!"" And I wonder if they've ever listened to the doors, Read about the doors or watched clips of interviews with the doors. First- right off the bat the silly dead indian scene is an outright fabrication. This never happened except in the mind of a 1960s record exec. To push JM into his contrived god- like status. By all accounts this was a fender bender and no medicine man died and entered into anyone's soul. This has been debunked by first hand witnesses aka every member of the Morrison family. Second JM was an ALCOHOLIC not a drug addict. There is really not anything out there to suggest he was into hard drugs- this is the assumption of morons who don't know anything about anything. "" oh the 60s? He must have been piping junk into his veins"" it's an absurd thing to say. Third - JM was a mild mannered guy who had some perfomance chops. He was decent and nice and not at all angry at everything. He happened to be a bad drunk. There are millions of them. And why wouldn't he be? He was surrounded by sycophants, suck- ups and enablers who kept telling him he was a the reincarnation of freaking Dionysus. Fourth- I would have loved to see any back story...anything involving the rest of the band. There was nothing. Now I know movies have serious time constraints but maybe Stone could have skipped one JM chasing someone around a bedroom scene or speaking in iambic pentameter scene. There was a tremendous amount of unneeded footage in this movie. This was almost a hit- piece. Maybe Stone hated Morrison because
Stone got shipped off to a ridiculous war and Morrison didn't. Who knows. Lastly people seem to think the surviving band members gave their blessing- they didn't. I think maybe Robbie Krieger was involved but scoffed at the finished product. As Ray Manzarek said in an interview "" Oliver Stone? I'd like to deck that guy, what a ridiculous movie! Why did he do it? I cant figure it out."" I'm sorry that Jim Morrison died, its tragic and sad but he was not a God. He was a so- so writer and a bad drunk who could not handle fame.

THE DOORS is one of those films I've yet to get my fill of, and that I watch on TV whenever I can (which unfortunately isn't often, since it's not as popular a film as it once was), along with other films I've ""OD'd"" on such as the INDIANA JONES series, BRAVEHEART, and various films by Quentin Tarantino. Someday, maybe, I'll have seen THE DOORS so many times that I'll have gotten sick of it, but that date lies far, far in the future - partly because I LOVE it!I wasn't even born when the band broke up in the early '70s, but I grew up with them because my parents had been in high school and college when the Doors were at the height of their fame, and they were part of my parents' collective playlist along with the Beatles and nearly everyone on the soundtrack of THE BIG CHILL. Over time, as I heard more and more of their repertoire, I came to be fascinated by the Doors. To this day, I consider them the first ""modern"" rock stars in the sense in which the MTV and VH-1 generations (to which I belong) think of them, and a major influence on both alternative and progressive rock (and heavy metal, too, in some ways). I can hear or at least perceive their influence in many rock bands that followed them, including Blue Oyster Cult, Oingo Boingo, Tool, and even Nirvana. ESPECIALLY Nirvana. Both ""Break on Through"" and ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" have helped me to make since of the world during my periods of existential doubt.So any movie about the Doors - and one by Oliver Stone in particular - is one I am going to revere. Not only is the music great (I don't think the band ever wrote a bad song), but the movie itself is unforgettable. Oliver Stone is a showman on par with Phineas T. Barnum, and so it goes without saying that THE DOORS is nothing short of a three-ring circus. Jim Morrison is shown to be a sort of combination of the Pied Piper and the title character of the famous comic book V FOR VENDETTA, with hangers-on from every which where latching onto him and his entourage. They are a diverse, even (arguably) multicultural bunch: Venice Beach bohemians, New York art snobs, Navajo Indians (albeit in Jim's fevered imagination), bikers and rednecks, and (of course) lots and lots and LOTS of hippies and flower children, decked out in everything from Nehru jackets to flowered headbands to pilgrim hats to skeleton makeup to striped clown pants. Not to mention massive hordes of teenage girls who would regularly become active participants in the stage shows - and would often be wearing absolutely nothing. I'd rather watch this than your average Fourth of July parade.THE DOORS is not a good film in the ""classical"" sense, and it doesn't even look like a classic film. At the very least, the cinematography is one-of-a-kind: so razor-sharp that nearly the entire film looks like a documentary (and not one from the 1960s, either, but the '90s, so I almost feel that the Doors are from my time); it reminds me a bit of THIS IS SPINAL TAP (another rock movie I enjoy). And I'd wager that nearly half the scenes in the film (yes, I kept track) are so rich in detail that they handsomely reward repeat viewings. But all that said, as visual storytelling THE DOORS falls well short of being perfect. The first hour is terrific, steadily charting the band's rise to the height of their fame. Then comes the second half, which shifts from Los Angeles to New York and San Francisco and Miami and eventually Paris, France - and the movie turns into a ""leave-the-camera-running"" exercise in self-indulgence (reminiscent of Andy Warhol, who appears as a character here). The rock concert scenes go on for what seem like hours, and they become repetitive (look, there's another naked girl, another angry cop, etc.). They're so long, in fact, that various other scenes - even some key scenes - end up being intercut with them. THE DOORS is approximately two and a half hours long, but it seems much longer.But after all's said and done, would I recommend THE DOORS to just about anyone? Heck, yes. The movie is a big mess, but it's endlessly colorful and never dull. Val Kilmer was all but born to play Morrison, and most of the other actors are hardly slouches themselves. And despite having been filmed in the '90s and depicting the '60s and early '70s, it all feels remarkably timeless. The ""Age of Aquarius"" counterculture is something we are still (and very confusedly) grappling with, and the questions Jim asks himself about where he is going and about life in general are ones that are worth pondering by every human being on earth.So hurrah for THE DOORS! To paraphrase the William Blake poem that inspired the bands name, Stone's opus allows us to see reality as it really is - infinite.",The Doors
107,Therod,"Pretty good, pretty neat",8,12 January 2002,"The Doors are one of my favorite bands (perhaps my favorite).  And this movie is probably the biggest reason why.I'm not saying this movie is without its flaws, because it is not (the one-dimensional portrayal of Morrison, most noteably).But great music and stunning visual effects more than make up for those few flaws.As I mentioned above, there's more to Morrison than is portrayed in the movie.  Sure, he was over the top and larger than life sometimes, but he was also, more often than not, an oridinary guy with ordinary feelings and problems.  But the spirit of Jim Morrison and the Doors endures and inspires regardless of what you think of him.I would have liked to have seen more emphasis put on the other band members (since the movies is called ""The Doors"" not ""Jim Morrison"") but hey, I'll forgive Stone -- he did an incredible job.My Grade:  A",The Doors
108,loveagoodstory,Brilliantly captures the mood of the times,10,22 August 2013,"One of the very best films I've seen in a cinema. A brilliant trip through the late sixties in what was tag-lined The Ultimate Story Of Sex, Drugs And Rock'n'Roll. The cinematography is rich in mood and puts you right there among the experience. The soundtrack of Doors tracks is incredibly captivating.The Doors is not a factually-accurate account of the band's history and exploits, as said by many critics including the band's keyboard player Ray Manzarek. Nonetheless, it's a fabulous immersion into the feeling of the wild and hedonistic times the band passed through. Watch it and drown down into it...",The Doors
109,nonconformist,Meg Ryan? You've got to be kidding!,8,9 January 2003,"If she wasn't in the film I probably would have given it another star. Stone also overdid the indian thing too.  But still, hollywood doing a movie on the doors.....  I think we were lucky it was as good as it was.  Kilmer looked so much like Morrison it was scary.  All the naked girls helped give it the feel of the time and helped me pay attention too.  If nothing else it was great to hear all those songs again and know that others wanted to hear them again enough for a movie like this to be made.I didn't see the movie when it came out because I was sure I would pick it apart, but I actually enjoyed the film.*** 1/2 out of five",The Doors
110,yearspew,A Near Masterpiece.,9,8 January 2008,"Oliver Stone's The Doors is an amazing movie that is entertaining, captivating, atmospheric and highly rewatchable.Val Kilmer portrays The Doors's leader Jim Morrison and gives a flawless performance of a flawed man. Kilmer captures the spirit of Jim Morrison in every scene, creating a sometimes sympathetic, sometimes unlikeable, but overall brilliant character.Kyle MacLachlan, Frank Whaley and Kevin Dillon portray Morrison's band mates Ray Manzarek, Robby Krieger and John Densmore respectively. They do a very good job and the chemistry between them works just fine.Meg Ryan is also great as Jim's soulmate, Pamela Courson. Needless to say, both Kilmer and Ryan also show perfect chemistry and create some of the film's most memorable scenes.To me, The Doors is a near masterpiece. Maybe a ""love or hate"" film. An impressive achievement that stands the test of time. Highly rewatchable and getting better every time.",The Doors
111,zachvalencia,Good movie,9,6 May 2015,I really enjoyed this movie. It was compelling and entertaining and exciting. I wouldn't say this movie was inaccurate like some people are saying I would say it left some pretty important parts out of Jims life. They focused on the wild side of Jim probably because it is the most entertaining and most unique. I would of liked to see more of his articulate side because he was a very smart guy. But overall it gives you a nice description of the doors and Jim and it kept me interested throughout the movie. You get to see the interesting band that the doors really were. I recommend not only to watch the movie but to listen to the great band the doors.,The Doors
112,MarilynManson,When Oliver Stone goes to hell Jim Morrison is gonna be waiting for him ready to kick his head in.,1,7 February 2000,"I cannot put into words just how appalling this film is from the point of view of a lifelong Jim Morrison/Doors fan.Firstly, after seeing the movie in full (I walked out of the cinema the first time I went to see it), I amazed as to how Ray M and John D had gotten involved in the movie when they themselves could see how fictional it was. But then again, Ray and John were always Judas's to Jim in life so why not in death....even their versions of history have been bent to paint themselves in a less heartless light in my opinion. Val Kilmer...what can I say.  The man is wooden at the best of times and he was diabolical as Jim.  If you have to make a movie then Jason Patric would have made a FANTASTIC Jim.Oliver Stone, known for portraying history in Stoneworld Vision, came at this subject from a sensational and almost entirely incorrect angle.  As someone who knows a hell of a lot about the history of The Doors I can categorically say that 80% of this film was fiction, 15% was a grossly distorted version of true events and the other 5% was to some extent true. I also hate the way Stone makes composites of characters.I think this could be justified by some people if it was actually a good film anyway but it just wasnt.  I never felt for a second I was in the 60's, terrible wigs/false beards, the wardrobe was consistently poor, the script was dire, terrible casting (in particular Kevin Dillon, Meg Ryan, Val Kilmer and what the hell was Billy Idol there for?) and the overall feel of the movie was all wrong.However, Stone did pull some nice shots off from a cinematography point of view and there were some good choices of location.  The score was obviously good (except when Val tried to sing) but that was to be expected surely. 
He got the characters wrong, he got history TOTALLY wrong and he tried to ruin the memory of an intelligent man.  He was only ever going to film Jim as The Lizard King but he didn't even get that bit right; Doors fans should know what I mean by that.I hate this movie passionatly and could tolerate it if I thought it would help gain new fans of the music but I don't think it does.If you want the real Jim Morrison/Doors then your best bet is to go read a book like Angels Dance and Angels Die or No-One Here Gets Out Alive (as flawed as that is).Jim had a sense of humour but I bet it would be sorely tested by this pretentious, self serviant piece of fiction that dares to claim it is a rock documentary.  I can only hope that when Stone meets Morrison in the next world Jim isn't too drunk to knock him out.",The Doors
113,nathanhmcdonald,Good entertainment for doors fans. But should not be considered a biopic.,7,9 April 2012,"First of all let me state that I am a HUGE fan of Jim Morrison and The Doors. I have read 5 biography's on Morrison himself, so when I watched this movie for the first time I compared it based off of the pre determined knowledge I gathered of Jim.With that said, let me state that this movie though entertaining and enjoyable should not be taken seriously as a Doors/Morrison biopic. The movie generally portrays only the bad side of Jim Morrison. The drunken babbling leather clad womanizer. However, show's very little of the sensitive, caring, intelligent poetic Morrison. If one were to watch this movie not knowing who Jim Morrison was they would probably walk away with the impression that he was the biggest asshole to ever walk the face of the earth. The movie spans from a time shortly before The Doors were conceived in 1966 all the way to Jim Morrison's untimely death on July 3rd 1971.The best things about this movie is the awesome soundtrack and Val Kilmers performance as Morrison was quite good. Kilmer himself did 90% of the singing for this movie and at times sounds quite close to Morrison's voice.With that said though this movie seems to be mostly Oliver Stones take on who he thought Jim Morrison was, and in his mind how The Doors were conceived. Though I don't think Oliver Stone made this movie with the intention of making Morrison look bad, he kind of did in nonchalant way.If you're like me and a fan of The Doors you'll probably either feel one of two ways about this movie...Either you will watch it and think that Oliver Stone was a total asshole to malportraying Jim Morrison and The Doors...Or you will be like me, and enjoying for being the semi fictional semi none fictional movie it is.If you are new to Jim Morrison and The Doors...DO NOT...I repeat DO NOT take this movie as fact. Much of the movie is Hollywood fiction and there is A lot of things left out about who The Doors were and how they started one of the greatest American rock/blues groups of the 1960s.",The Doors
114,thecure-1,"Open your ""Doors"" to this movie ...",9,22 April 2019,"Read a lot of reviews here and many are hung up on the fact that it was more about Morrison than about the band ... Maybe Oliver Stone called it ""The Doors"" referring to the meaning of the band's name and not so much the group itself ... Either way, even though the Doors had GREAT musicians, the Doors would NOT be the Doors without Morrison...ANYWAY, IMHO ...What DID work: the way the movie included the music and when, the scenes, the 60's feeling, Val Kilmer's performance, the final shots at the Lachaise cemetery ... even Oliver Stone's interpretation of where Morrison was at, his identification with native Americans, the lizard king, his love for poetry ... why The Doors are such an important R&R band ...What did NOT work: Some of the exaggerations or made up scenes (Pam's burning, thanksgiving), showing Jim Morrison as very (ironically) one-dimensional... he just wants to get fed-up ... Robbie's line: ""you like pain but you are constantly trying to avoid it"" shows what Oliver Stone thought ...Final recommendation: If you like music and you are not old like me and want to get a sense of what that time was like (leaving some room for doubt as this is Stone's perception after all), then do watch this movie!",The Doors

He must have been disappointed when it was all over. Alas, ""The Doors"" is no party movie, and it is indeed the guest that will never leave.As he showed in ""Platoon"" and to a lesser extent ""Born On the Fourth of July,"" Oliver Stone is a capable storyteller, but the problem here is with what he has to work with -- the pop career of a pretentious singer/poet/warlord and his three mediocre comrades. Let's face it: The Doors had one real moment of creativity (""The End"") and that's not really enough to make an entire movie out of. So Stone resorts to ugly globs of surrealistic flashbacks and foreshadows.Do yourself a favor and rent ""Apocalypse Now,"" enjoy Coppola's use of ""The End"" and forget about this misguided biopic.",The Doors

118,famsmith,A cinematic advance in an era where true cinema seems all but forgotten!,9,1 December 2000,"This film is a gem!  Without a doubt the best film of the music genre of cinema.  Val Kilmer delivers an astounding performance in which he almost seems to be channeling the energy of Jim Morrison.  Although I am not a fan of Oliver Stone I must give credit where it is due he did a terrific job with this film.  This film is what Stone is capable of when he actually knows what he is attempting to comment on.  Stone does an amazing job several times throughout the film of recreating events as they actually occurred, but simultaneously realizes that ultimately for a film to possess its own vitality, a vitality beyond that of a mere representation or reflection of reality it must transcend reality and attempt to express something much deeper than what is on the surface.  Stone also does an excellent job in getting stellar performances out of the rest of the cast. This is one of the few films of Meg Ryan's I've ever seen where she does a good enough job to make you really forget about her and focus on the character.  The cinematography by Robert Richardson (director of photography of Platoon, Wall Street, Natural Born Killers, Born on the Fourth of July, Casino, Bringing Out the Dead, and many more) is bold and extraordinary, making it one of the most unique and distinct visual films I have ever seen. The great thing about this film is it is so much more than a behind the scenes account of a rock n' roll band.  It is also very interesting in that most of the score consists of songs of the band that the story is about, and I have never seen another film that has accomplished this to the same extent.  In a time when there are so few films that give first priority to the cinematic content of the film this is a refreshing masterpiece that discovers new territory.  Whether or not you enjoy the film it is one of the few cinematic films of its decade, and it is also safe to say that there is no other film exactly like this one.",The Doors
119,famsmith,A refreshing cinematic breakthrough in an era in which cinema seems all but forgotten!,9,3 December 2000,"This film is truly a gem.  The Doors is easily the best film of the rock n' roll genre and at least one of the most important films of its era. Though I am not an Oliver Stone fan I must give credit where it is due.  Stone really does a terrific job with this film, and shows what he is capable of when he actually knows about the subject he is attempting to comment on. A few of the scenes in the film are almost exact recreations of actual events. However, the magnificent thing about this film is that it manages to recreate a certain amount of reality while simultaneously realizing that for a film to possess its own vitality it must transcend the preexisting reality, move beyond the surface, beyond everything that is obvious, and express and explore something deeper.  Val Kilmer delivers a powerful performance in which he almost seems to be channeling the energy of Jim Morrison, and though I've seen many of Meg Ryan's films this is the only one I can recollect where she does such a good job that she makes you really forget about her and focus on the character.  The cinematography of the film by Robert Richardson (Platoon, Wall Street, Born on The Fourth of July, Natural Born Killers, Casino, Bringing out the Dead, and many more) is bold and unique making the film one of the most distinct visual films I've ever seen.  This film is truly one of a kind, and breaks through into new cinematic territory, giving priority to the visual aspects of the film in an era where there are so few films that even give much consideration to the single most important aspect of the motion picture.  The genius of this film is that it is visual-audio as opposed to audio-visual and is more concerned with expressing something than simply impressing the audience.

121,williamalake,Good Film,7,25 August 2008,"I Love the doors and Jim Morrison. So I thought that I would love this film too. I thought it was great, Val Kilmer did a fantastic job and I hardly doubt whether anybody else could have done better. But I did get a little bored at times. (I guess I felt how some of his band mates felt about his antics!) There is no doubting that Jim Morrison was a hugely talented individual, but he did have his demons. This film recreated this brilliantly and portrayed Jim as I would have imagined him to be (not being alive at the same time as Jim was!) The film, however, is only a 7/10 because it isn't the greatest film I've ever seen. It does provide an insight into Jim's Life and it was portrayed very well. I have seen better but I have seen a whole lot worse too! I would recommend this film to any fans of 'the doors' but you probably won't enjoy it if you don't like the band!",The Doors
122,MightyAlz,One of the silliest films I have ever seen.,5,22 September 2007,"Oh, boy, where to begin...Now, I'm a fan of the Doors. I'm not really a fan of Oliver Stone, but hey, a movie's a movie.But Christ! There's OTT and then there's LSDOTT! This is supposedly a biopic of the Doors, but Ray Manzarek, John Densmore and Robby Krieger get barely a mention. At best, they're portrayed as Jim's friends, at worst, ass-holes.So this film is basically Jim Morrison. Now I like Jim's lyrics and voice, but the Doors would have been nothing without the fabulous music. Of course, he led by far the most chaotic lifestyle so it's inevitable he would get the most screen time, but oh my god, you wouldn't believe some of the rubbish Ollie sticks in this film. He raises Jim to status of some kind of Godlike figure. He has Indian spirits dancing around him when he performs. Every second word is some kind of mystical phrase. Every time he performs it's like it's some great historical event. Even the notorious incident when got out his penis on stage is transformed in a ludicrous sacred ritual! Not to mention the mystic orgies, insane (and nonfactual) stage behaviour, long drawn-out shots of him staring into the eyes of an Indian spirit who appears for no reason at all. It's all reminiscent of those ultra-pretentious art-house movies that were prominent in the 60's which have dated so badly.It's so utterly nonsensical you wonder what Ollie was thinking (or drinking)! That's not the only problem with the film - it's historically inaccurate too, as has been pointed out in other reviews. The goofs section will tell all you need to know - you get the feeling that Ollie idolised Jim Morrison way too much.As for the acting - variable. I'll admit, Val Kilmer does a TERRIFIC performance - it's uncanny at times. He's wasted in this movie. There are some particularly poor performances though. The scene that takes place in Andy Warhol's factory contains the worst offenders. Andy himself is portrayed as, well, WTF?! Just too weird and stupid to believe, uttering some idiotic dialogue about ""Would you like to talk to God, Jim?"" And Nico, who was known to be Jim's lover before he died, has almost racist portrayal.Still, after all this I have to say I did enjoy watching the movie. It's beautifully shot and wonderfully evocative of the era. As a piece of art-house trash, it's fun.As a biopic, it couldn't be worse.",The Doors
123,Puregold,Stone's strange vision of a strange trip.,6,29 November 1998,"While much of what I saw in Oliver Stone's film The Doors very well probably happened, I have no doubt that a lot of it didn't actually happen the way Mr. Stone wants us to think it did. I know Jim Morrison drank and drugged himself to death, and he was one strange, stoned, drunk rock and roll, genius poet, but there is not one moment in this film that isn't depicted as out of control, drug induced, violent and crazy. Watching this film gave me a headache. Stone attempts to take the reader on one mad ride after another as we fly through Jim Morrison and The Doors all too brief life and death as a great rock and roll band. Instead of focusing more on how he met his lifetime companion, and how The Doors formed, this movie is more obsessed with showing us just what a tragic figure Morrison was.Hey Oliver, how about a little bit more on the band and less on the sadness that was Jim Morrison?",The Doors

The way it's shot and designed seems to suggest the former.The acting , music, scenery, and design is en pointe, but this is just a movie about celebrating sickos. If you believe everything in this , Jim Morrison tried to burn his lover in a closet, cheated on everyone he said he loved, and was a raging addict.Why did I ever like this band ?

Although critic Roger Ebert only gave it a 2 1/2 out of 4 stars, this movie was a hit with audiences. Arguably Kilmer's best performance in his career, he auditioned for Stone by sending tapes of him singing The Doors tunes. Meg Ryan plays Pamela Courson, Morrison's love interest who goes in and out of his life depending on the drug trip he is on. Supporting characters include Kyle MacLachlan as Ray Manzarek, Frank Whaley as Robby Krieger, Kevin Dillon as John Densmore and Kathleen Quinlan as a satanic worshiper who helps Morrison get his virility back.

126,ReggieSantori,Stone's Beautiful Tribute Succeeds All The Way,10,16 April 2004,"Only Oliver Stone could manage to make a 140 minute bio-drama about this band and make it work. He and cinematographer Robert Richardson make this a wonderful, tripped-out experience that never leaves reality behind (I'm speaking of drama, not facts) and never lets nostalgia overcome the story. Of course I'll give credit where it's due, Val Kilmer gives what is probably his best performance in the role of the one and only Jim Morrison.The film opens with a depiction of that famous event from Morrison's childhood, when he saw the Indian die, setting the viewer up for the semi-legendary tone of this film. Stone clearly has a reverence for the time and the man. From there we follow Morrison from being misunderstood in film-school through his life and love and years with The Doors, to his death in Paris. Along the way, Oliver Stone works another miracle: he prevents Meg Ryan from ruining the film with that irritating ""cuteness"" that's left so many others in flames. Ryan is forced into the non-cute position of Morrison's lover and ""muse"" who suffers endlessly at his fame and drug abuse. One of my favorite scenes has Kilmer dangling out a window asking Ryan if she'd die for him.The soundtrack is almost entirely Doors songs, many of which are performed (very well) by Kilmer. The supporting cast features an unrecognizable Kyle MacLachlan in a good turn as another member of The Doors. As with many Stone films, fact and fiction are blended together to tell the story, but it doesn't detract at all from the worth of this film. What the viewer gets is an emotionally active look at the short life and career of Jim Morrison. The performances are good, Stone's script and direction are in good form, and the photography and editing elevate the film to a higher level of cinema.THE DOORS is a must see picture. Never before or since has there been a celebrity biography to succeed so thoroughly as a drama and as a film. Reggie can't get enough of this!",The Doors

128,Deckard42,No one is getting out of here alive!,10,8 March 2007,"What an incredible piece of art! The Doors is without doubt the most underrated movie I have seen so far. Given that it is dealing with a character of which almost everybody already has a picture of his own, this might not be a surprise. It is a surprise though, how poorly the movie's message seems to have been accepted.What Oliver Stone has done here, is not an accurate portrayal of Jim Morrison or the Doors. Instead he has created something far more valuable: An extremely deep insight into the work of the Doors, but mostly Jim Morrison. You have to understand this movie as a fusion of Jim Morrison and his art, as a portrayal of his life from the perspective of the artist.This does not mean the movie is portraying something imaginary, which never existed like this. Jim Morrison WAS like this, just he was not like this for most of the time or for most of the people around him. So you could ask, why making a movie from a perspective, why portraying a side, that for most does only cover a small piece of reality? The answer is simple: Because this piece is the one that persisted, the one that will persist. And that is not by accident, it is because this is the most fascinating and deepest picture Jim Morrison has left for others to explore.The idea of having only a short moment to live, the idea of putting all your passion and all your anger into this moment - at the same time being desperately in search for a way to forget, to bear this fate. The life on the edge of death, in a world of beauty and pain - the desperate attempt to squeeze out every feeling just possible from your given moments, before everything is over. Giving away everything, in the light of the insight that you won't be able to hold tight anything - being delivered to death: ""You have seen This entertainment through and through. You've seen your birth, your life and death; You might recall all of the rest...""If you now go into criticizing and analyzing this attitude, for good reasons for sure, stop for a moment and imagine:I am the lizard king - I can do anything!",The Doors

I guess I was expecting a good film. I got what I was looking for. However, this film completely distorted my view of Jim Morrison's personality. In the film, he's portrayed (quite well, might I add) by Val Kilmer as a drunk and a junkie. Granted, when he wasn't stoned he was usually drunk, but the film doesn't point out his good qualities. Few and far between though they may be, they were still there. He wasn't just a musical genius A-Hole. He was supposedly a nice guy when he was sober. If you want to learn about Jim Morrison, read No One Here Gets Out Alive. If you want a really great film with hardly any historical accuracy, rent ""The Doors."" If for nothing other than the incredible soundtrack. Of course, perhaps I'm a little biased. As I mentioned, I'm a huge fan of the Doors.

130,Yossarian-,Visually Stunning Forerunner to Natural Born Killers,10,1 April 2000,"First off, let me say that I couldn't care less how realic or unrealistic this movie is. 'The Doors' has received plenty of criticism over its historical accuracy, and from what I've read the criticism is probably due, but I regard the movie as simply that, a movie. Oliver Stone's historical track record (JFK, Platoon, Salvador) makes it clear that his movies are heavily steeped in history, but diverge, aiming for message and visuals rather than accuracy.That said, I thought 'The Doors' was a brilliant movie. I am a child of the 1990's, I was born long after Jim died, so I guess I look more for impressions and statements in movies, rather than linear narrative. And 'The Doors' gave me much cause for excitement. I saw the movies several months after seeing Stone's 'Natural Born Killers' (which I found even more brilliant), and the stylistic parallels between the two were uncanny. I believe the real strength in 'The Doors' lies in its visual style: the strong red visuals running the movies length, effective and stunning use of timelapse photography, surreal editing, not to mention the Indian theme (which also appears in 'NBK').I agree that Jim was portrayed in a bad light. The first forty minutes of the movie were narratively wonderful, the remaining ninety minutes portrayed Jim going off the 'deep end'. However, Stone did redeem his character in the closing two scenes, though perhaps a little too neatly.The four or five concerts in the movie were mindblowingly staged, shot and edited (particularly the last two), with the strong hallucenagenic theme running through them and the everpresent Indian. Jim's character (played to perfection by Kilmar) for me represeted someone who, as was stated in the movie, pushed the limits: a true electric poet in the fashion of romantics like Keats. If seen in the right light, 'The Doors' can be an inspirational movie. It does have its faults, like the bland and cringeworthy Thanksgiving scene, but on the whole it is one incredible visual trip, in a way the more convoluted younger brother of 'Natural Born Killers'. 5/5.",The Doors
131,fruitbat319,"Heavy handed, to say the least",5,17 July 2007,"I have to admit that, not being a particularly huge Oliver Stone fan, I went into this movie with a certain amount of skepticism. I will also admit that this was one of those movies that I rented because I knew it ended morbidly. As far as biopics go, it's pretty typical--sex, drugs, rock and roll, all the usual things people like to experience vicariously, all executed with Stone's characteristically leaden hand. There were scenes I fast-forwarded. There are some (very) prolonged acid-trip scenes, and the only thing they made me realize is that Oliver Stone has never dropped acid. There is, for the most part, very little character development, with Jim Morrison portrayed as the drug-addled, misunderstood and frankly quite annoying visionary, his girlfriend as your standard nagging wife figure who holds back said visionary, and the other three Doors members as, well, totally interchangeable and expendable. I just couldn't admire the character of Jim at all, I think his portrayal could have been handled a lot better; he could have been made into a much more well-developed, sympathetic and admirable guy instead of the spoiled, egotistical moron that Stone favored. And that's not saying I'm not a Doors fan. I am. All I'm saying is that if the portrayal is true to life at all, Jim Morrison may have survived a little longer if there had been someone sensible to punch him in the mouth from time to time.",The Doors

133,Ms H,Great if you're into drugs and chaos,1,8 February 1999,"This is a total waste of celluloid. The chaotic, mindless ""drug-induced"" backdrop of the movie, seems to me to be a gratuitous mention for those stoned and wishing to experience that same environment through film. Only people seriously into the Doors...or drugs...need watch this. Although, it is a good example of what not to do if you make it big on the charts.",The Doors
134,dogge84,changed my life,10,11 April 2003,"My eyes were closed until autumn 1995, when channel 5 in Sweden showed The Doors. I taped it and didn't think too much of it in the beginning. The only thing I knew about The Doors was their song ""Light my fire"".A friend of mine, who borrowed the film from me, told me he liked the ""cave"" scene and the music in it. I myself liked the scene where Jim climbs up to Pam's balcony. That was pretty much it. But then I noticed the song ""love street"" which is played in the beginning, and then I realized that the guitar intro to ""The end"" wasn't that bad. After that I bought the soundtrack and now I was pretty much hooked. I put my eurodisco records on a shelf and became a ""rock'n roller"", and Jim was my role model. My relationship to Jim Morrison is actually the closest to being a gay that I will ever be.The best part of the film are the opening thirty minutes, where Jim ""quits"" his film class on UCLA, follows Pam home from the beach and takes her out on a night walk, rehearses with the band and ""Light my fire"" is introduced. Too bad we never get to see the band being formed. I love that story, when Jim meets Ray on the beach and that conversation leads up to Jim singing ""Moonlight drive"". This scene is also one of few which shows the real Jim Morrison, but I will get back to that later. Around this time, Jim meets his girlfriend with whom he stayed until he died. After half an hour, the movie takes on in a different direction. It is from now on, a very dark movie. This is for a reason, and the reason is that Oliver wants the audience to see everything through Jim's eyes. The result is that some scenes are very surreal and after a while you may think that Oliver Stone himself took some acid before shooting them.The negative side of the film, which have made many people upset, is the way Jim Morrison is presented. Jim is high or/and drunk in nearly every scene he appears in, and since the movie is shown through his angle the result is the surrealism and spaced-out scenes. ""Jimbo"" has unfortunately a bigger part than Jim. (See the movie and you'll know what I mean.)I have read practically every book there is to read about The Doors, including the one named ""light my fire"", written by the organist Ray Manzarek. This guy isn't too happy with the movie. I see his point but at the same time, he confirms in the book that most of the things in the movie has actually happened; the back against the audience, the Ed Sullivan sequence where Jim sings the word ""higher"" on national television, the TV-throwing in the studio. Other things could never happen or are just simply wrong; the Andy Warhole-party where Jim is abandoned by the rest of the band (something that true friends would never do to one another), Jim's student project (his movie didn't look like that at all), Jim's red mustang (Jim had a blue mustang which he actually called ""the blue lady"").Oliver Stone focuses the movie on the wrong things. Sure, Jim Morrison was a pothead, but he was also a very intelligent, sensitive, friendly and funny person. This is far from the picture most people have of him after seeing the movie. But if you know this, and just want some Rock'n roll in your life you will like the movie anyway. Another strange thing is that Oliver Stone has said that he loved Jim and wanted the movie to be a sort of homage to him!? Some homage. So the film is great, however it is not the real story of Jim Morrison. The only time we see the sensitive side of Jim is when he turns down an early offer from a record company man who tells him to ""drop those guys"". The music numbers are the scenes that impresses me the most. The choreography, the lighting of the stage, and, above all, the fact that Val Kilmer actually sings all the songs by himself. Look at the ""Not to touch the earth"" sequence and you'll know what I mean.And now we come to the best thing with this movie. The ONE thing that made me buy it and watch it about 30 times after that. That thing is Val Kilmer. An actor who hadn't made anything spectacular before this and haven't really done anything after it. He was born to do this part. It isn't the real Jim, but an alternative Jim who you kind of love to hate. But now I'm only talking about the personality. Kilmer walks like, talks like, sings like, and above all looks like Jim. And some looks. What wouldn't I give to have that hair or that wardrobe. Besides Kilmer, there are many more great and well-known actors in this movie; Mimi Rogers, Michael Wincott, Josie Bissett, Crispin Glover, Kathleen Quinlan (who plays the very true character Patricia Keneally), and one of the few actors that I can't stand; Michael Madsen. Also, some artists gone acting; Billy Idol, Swedens own Eagle-Eye Cherry (whose scene were cut out from the final film), and if my eyes aren't lying to me; Billy Vera. And oh yeah, I almost forgot: MEG RYAN (arrr).Also, do not forget to check out the cool end credits, with fast speeding pictures of night time L.A, being played to ""L.A woman"".I now see that channel four is showing ""Wall Street"". Very appropriate way to spend the rest of this evening, don't you think? Of course, it can't be compared to The Doors but nevertheless!",The Doors
135,chiragkapadia2004,a masterpiece.,9,8 December 2005,"I was a generation too late for the Doors.Yes , I had heard some of their hits, knew that they were led by the mercurial guy Jim Morrison, who in the footsteps of true rock legends, had committed suicide.But that was about it.Why I am mentioning this is to clarify that I the praise that is going to follow is not because I am a true-blue Doors fan, and that I dig anything and everything related to Doors. The reason is because, quite simply, it is a brilliant film. Oliver Stone handles the subject matter with a kind of mastery that ordinary directors won't even dare. Who would dare to start off a movie on Doors with what initially seems a scene of no consequence in the desert? The whole atmosphere of the 60s is built up superbly.Yes, the ,mandatory wigs, big sunglasses, beads and amulets, naked women, Woodstock...all are there, but there is more.It's the intangible, that feeling which you get that yes, this is what the 60s was.The wild world of rock and roll, made more complicated by the fact that Jim Morrison was far more enigmatic and complex than your typical rockstar,and at the same time an absolute brilliant song-writer is all conveyed just the way it should be. And as if all this was not enough, you have Val Kilmer playing one of the most brilliant lead performances as Jim Morrison.In fact, the similarity between is quite eerie.I watched a couple of Jim Morrison vids after the movie, and boy,u would think that they are related. Yes, liberties have been taken with the actual events.Morrison was not as moody and self-destructive as shown in the movie.So don't go into the movie expecting a documentary on Jim , instead, watch it as a glimpse into the crazy world of 60s, and each and every minute of the movie will be worth it.",The Doors
136,seanlewie,Jim Morrison Featuring The Doors,6,5 November 2018,"The Doors biopic is, obviously, about The Doors... kind of. Its more of a Jim Morrison biopic to where it barely gives insight on the relationship between band and Morrison which separates this movie from being a Jim film rather than it about the band. Besides all that, it really isn't a bad film. Its a pretty good Morrison film, actually. But since it is called ""The Doors"" i came in expecting to see quite a bit of the band itself but i barely got to see it. All i really saw was an interesting yet annoying acid trip of the mess-ily told story of Jim Morrison with a sprinkle of The Doors.",The Doors

138,Keef-4,Decent Movie...Great Movie if You Like the Doors,10,10 March 1999,"One of the only problems with this movie is that it cuts straight from the car accident scene that Morrison witnessed as a child to the late 60's, when he is completely immersed in a world of excess.  Morrison's late childhood and teenage years are not represented in this movie, and if you've ever seen a documentary about him (i.e. VH1 Legends), you would know that his experience as a military brat, his interests as a child, and his relationship with his family would shape his unusual personality and drive him towards poetry, music and the excesses of dope, booze and sex.Most of scenes in the movie actually took place.  The TV- throwing scene, the closet-burning scene, and the ""You killed my duck"" scene are the exceptions.  It seems to dwell on the most negative aspects of Morrison's life and personality, and that doesn't help to paint him in a positive light.The positives:  Val Kilmer was great (the acting was pretty good), Stone's experimentation with camera techniques (like the peyote scene), and of course the music.  The biggest contribution was from the band for which this movie was named.",The Doors
139,Eels14,A good movie for it's time,8,1 November 2007,"Like so many other people I was enticed and became a doors fan after seeing this movie for the first time when it was released in 1991 at the cinema.I also remember seeing the Australian Doors show live in concert in '93 and back than there was still talk going around about the movie. But the thing I find now is that the movie no longer works for me, it seems to of lost it's spark!! Maybe because it's been 15 years since all of this happened?!?! Anyway, at the time I found Oliver Stones production a wild and cool ride into the life of Jim Morrison and the Doors, but at the same time found it to be over the top. One example was the Doors live performance on the Ed Sullivan show. The the real footage of Jim in '67 singing Light My Fire had him standing still, but in the movie Val Kilmer struts over to the camera and says the word ""higher"" during the song in an in your face kind of way. Another would be the wild side of Jim constantly being shown and as any Doors fan would know Morrison wasn't always like that. I guess Oliver Stone had to make an appealing movie and usually drama and the worse side of someone will draw people to a movie.No doubt the Doors gained popularity at the time once again because of this film. Back in the early 90's how many people did you see wearing Jim Morrison T-Shirts? For me the best parts of the movie were the three live concerts in New Haven, San Francisco and the notorious Miami. Val Kilmer was awesome and I don't think anybody else including Michael Hutchence would of done a better job at the time. Kilmer was almost Jim Morrison he was that convincing!!! He even sang a little during the live performances.Like I said earlier an awesome movie at the time and a great experience, but will only remain a memory to me.",The Doors
140,rondo898,The Gizzard King,2,6 November 2016,"According to According to *No One Here Gets Out Alive* by Danny Sugarman, that's pretty much the way Morrison acted in real life: A mean, fat,narcissistic, drunk. But that's true of many rock stars. If you were disappointed by how this movie depicts him, maybe you should choose better idols.Look up all the live footage of the performances of The Doors now available, and Jim Morrison generally does nothing but stand frozen at the microphone stand, crooning with his eyes closed. He was not much of a performer, and Val Kilmer was a far better Jim Morrison than Morrison ever was.Despite Stone's clumsy attempts at being artistic, this is one long soap opera.",The Doors
141,Vagabonding83,One of the best life adaptations of fame,8,7 March 2006,"I saw this one outta sheer love for Morrison. Though in the first half hour or so, i was taken aback by few forced deliverance to imitate his aura, i was pleasantly surprised by the longevity of character that kilmer created. and by the time the titles rolled, i strongly believed that this is the closest you will ever get to screen adaptations of an idol, kilmer has not played Morrison, he IS Morrison in this one, through his convoluted hours of bliss, to his on-stage romance with the realization of phallic power, from his hours of loneliness to his unrest with the commoditization of music, from his profound, almost indifferent deliverance to his childish vulnerability, kilmer scores. a great achievement for oliver stone too, meg Ryan could have been replaced for the better though....i also did not quite understand two things- why were all the other doors shown so smaller against Morrison, and where was the serene emotion seen in Morrison's eyes when he used to perform as seen in many of his live acts? kilmer does push it a little more towards insanity which is true but only in parts. his last days in France are not covered well, possibly due to the controversy surrounding his demise. another good thing about the classic is its uncompromising, unbiased portrayal of one of the greatest ever rock and youth idols.",The Doors
142,b_buddy1,Val Kilmer's Magnum Opus,8,20 May 2008,"The Doors is unapologetically a film about sex, drugs, and rock n' roll. For 140 minutes we follow Doors singer Jim Morrison from his days as an aspiring film student at UCLA to his death in Paris in 1970 at the age of 27. Writer-director Oliver Stone based the story of the film on some 150 transcripts detailing the life and character of Morrison. The result is far from flattering. The Doors paints a picture of a man enamored with death, his own inevitable demise more a relief than an agony.Death stalks Morrison wherever he goes from a young age. As a child driving through the New Mexico desert with his family, Morrison happens across the site of a car accident littered with dead and dying Navahos. We watch the young Morrison endure what seems to be a sort of possession rite by spirits of the dead natives. Years later he'll profess to be a shaman and from what we see on screen, he might well have believed it to be true. Native American spirits dance alongside Morrison as he sings on stage. Whether these were real or simply an acid fueled hallucination is left deliberately unclear by Stone. Likewise, a death-like character (Richard Rutowski) shadows Morrison throughout his life as a rock singer. Whether this indicates Morrison saw death as a friend, was actually accompanied by Rutowski (who was a real life friend of Morrison), or was simply hallucinating remains ambiguous. What is clear is the following: in his great desire to self destruct, Morrison drank whiskey like water and spent an inordinate amount of time on precarious ledges outside Hotel windows thirty stories up.Kilmer's performance as Morrison is easily the finest of his career. Raw, nervy, deliberately off putting and confrontational, moments of sobriety are few are far between for this insecure egomaniac. At times I didn't feel as though I was watching a portrayal of a character long deceased so much as a documentary. From threatening suicide repeatedly to quarreling constantly with police at concerts, scenes of bad behavior are many but moments of insight are few and far between. This doesn't seem a shortcoming on behalf of director Stone so much as an accurate depiction of the highly acidic Morrison as he truly was; this was a man who didn't want to be understood. This was an artist on the constant edge of oblivion; an iconoclast who refused to be loved and was close to intolerable whenever possible. Of course it's less than a pleasant experience following the venomous creature that Morrison became for the film's final hour as he goes from alcohol induced nervous breakdown to drug fueled indecent exposure, but I for one appreciate Stone's refusal to Hollywoodize the life and death of Morrison. Kilmer abandons completely all instinct for self preservation on screen, submerging himself in a performance that can only be described as his magnum opus.Meg Ryan leads the supporting cast as Pamela ""Morrison"" Courson, Morrison's longtime lover and common-law wife. Ryan seems lost in the role but thankfully spends a minimal amount of time on screen as Morrison was a firm supporter of the ""free love"" social movement. Indeed, he spends more time with journalist and witchcraft enthusiast Patricia Kennealy (Kathleen Quinlan), an amalgam of several Morrison lovers who suffered through his frequent alcohol and drug induced impotence. A very fine Michael Madsen is wasted as actor Tom Baker, a friend of Morrison's whose relationship is grossly underdeveloped. The only performance among the supporting cast worthy of praise is that of quirky character actor Crispin Glover in a cameo as Andy Warhol, a scene that is absolutely spellbinding.Some may criticize The Doors for glamorizing a life of excess; this film gives younger viewers the idea that drugs and promiscuous sex are fun, critics may charge. Those who would are missing the point entirely. As are those who would interpret this film as the cautionary tale of a life wasted. Little about the character we view on screen is glamorous. It seems no accident that Morrison died as he did. This was a man obsessed with death; his demise seems more a moment of wish fulfillment than tragedy. My only significant criticism of the film is that the title is certainly a misnomer; this could have easily been titled ""The Jim Morrison Story"" as there is not a single scene on screen without the eccentric singer while the remaining members of the band are relegated to obscurity. Call it art imitating life once more.",The Doors

It's much more fun to do that at home with friends, but while reading some other comments on this movie, I couldn't hold it back any more.First of all: Before watching this movie it's better to know a little something about The Doors and especially about Jim Morrison. This movie pretty accurately describes Jim's life during the sixties, and his relationship with the rest of the band and everyone around him. The fact that it was made in cooperation with the other members of the band kind of gives that away.Secondly: If you don't know anything about Jim, it's easy to say that the film was over the top. But that's exactly how Jim Morrison was, over the top, larger then life, a genius in his own time. He was a living legend that refused to abide by the rules society placed on him.And thirdly: Some sequences in the movie will strike you as awkward if you're not familiar with the Doors, but fans will recognise them, and appreciate the effort put into this film.At this point I have to say that Val Kilmer's portrayal of Jim was scary in it's accuracy. Not only did he look like him, but he seemed to get everything right. His movement, his manner of talking, the way Jim would give away a show. It wasn't acting, it was almost like seeing Jim reincarnated.",The Doors
150,napalm-6,A Terrible Depiction of Jim Morrison,5,9 January 2004,"Oliver Stone enjoys making up fictional BS to make his movies more interesting. He did it with Nixon, he'll most likely do it with his upcoming Alexander the Great movie, and he most certainly did it with ""The Doors.""First and foremost, Jim Morrison was a well-educated, intelligent, and very funny person who got along very well with almost everyone he encountered in his 27 short years of life (if he is in fact dead). Ray Manzarek, the real Doors keyboardist, said Oliver Stone twisted Morrison's image around, making it appear as though Morrison was a constantly drugged-out, crazy rock-n-roll jerk who loved two things: drugs and loose women. This is not the true Jim Morrison. The real man was, yes, an alcoholic who indeed had his way with many easy ladies, but he was so much more. He was the most revolutionary rockstar in history who paved the way for modern rockers and punks and rebels to act and portray themselves. And if anyone disagrees with me, I'd like them to prove me wrong. And not only that, Morrison was one of the most gifted poets in history, penning some of the best lyrics ever written. Finally, he was one hell of a good singer who, although he may not have had the best voice in music history, definitely had the greatest, most blood-curdling screams and rough, awesome voices.In conclusion, Oliver Stone should have never made such a ridiculously terrible movie about my favorite band, and one of the best bands ever, The Doors.",The Doors

156,seemoreglass6,The Doors (1991),4,3 August 2010,"Oliver Stone, a director notorious for rewriting historical events to suit his own agenda, is in typical form in this epic aggrandizement.Though Stone is often regarded as one of cinema's foremost chroniclers of the 60s, The Doors seems aimed not so much at those who ""were there,"" & who might thus be expected to view the film from a nostalgic as well as a critical perspective, as it is at young people liable to be seduced by the film's idealistic glamor without questioning its historical validity. I know; I was one of their smitten multitudes at the time it came out. Hence the movie finds Stone (as usual) simply doing whatever he wants, with a kind of indulgence that can only be described as adolescentfrom having Jim Morrison quit UCLA Film School when he actually graduated from it to attributing the words of French symbolist poet Arthur Rimbaud to Morrison himself. It wouldn't have been out of line if he'd marketed his film in conjunction with meal deals and ""Doors"" action figures, because that, in spite of star Val Kilmer's best efforts, is precisely what the script makes this story into. Peppered with cringingly bad but campishly fabulous dialog like ""We're gonna fu*k death away, baby"" and ""Would you forget about The Doors? It's you they wantJim Morrison, the god of rock"" Stone's script might have easily come right out of Spinal Tap; even if, in all fairness, 20-something rock stars in the prime of their careers do tend to be clichés...whether they're prodigiously brilliant lyricists or not.By most accounts, there seems to be no doubt Morrison was probably as excessive as Stone portrays him here. In fact, the rock star's theatricality fits...and mostly conveniently renders superfluous...the director's penchant for the same. But even with so much real-life luridness to work with, Stone doesn't hesitate to repeatedly insert inventions.....such as in the scene where a jealously raging ""Jim"" locks a heroin-droopy ""Pam"" in the closet and sets it on fire.On the positive side, Val Kilmer does a wonderful job here. His is one of those rare performances that is more psychic channeling than homage, and his physical resemblance to Morrison is uncanny. But Meg Ryan as the 18-24 year old Pamela Courson, Morrison's ""cosmic mate,"" is absurd, and Kathleen Quinlan as his wife-by-Wiccan handfasting ceremony Patricia Kennealy is even more off the mark. The innately eccentric Crispin Glover as Andy Warhol is an interesting choice, and one that might have worked, if his hairpiece had only looked less like an Eva Gabor catalog accessory. The cinematography, as it is in most of Stone's films, is stunning, evoking other campy but beautiful road films like Easy Rider & Zabriskie Point.Those who care enough about The Doors to inquire further are advised to read Danny Sugarman's biography ""No One Here Gets Out Alive."" As for Stone, 18 years later, he's still in a Tim Drummish/Peter Panish haze, and his penchant for action figureyfrom entertainers to politicians.is strong as ever.",The Doors
157,JZECCOLO,Very insightful movie and excellent performance by Val,8,5 February 2005,"Val Kilmer did a great job portraying Jim Morrison. He brings you into the spiraling life of Jim Morrison and back to the days of sex, drugs, and rock and roll.Throughout the movie you see what made Jim Morrison tick, and get to hear some great music along the way. The cinematography during his drug induced hallucinations is well done and helps pull you into Morrison;s life. Definitely a movie you can sit and watch more than once and one you can enjoy whatever age you are.Whether you were a dedicated Mossison fan or have never followed him, this movie is entertaining on it's face. The fact that the movie portrays the real life of a rock and roll legend, makes the movie that much more interesting.",The Doors
158,Deerbra15,"""There are things known and things unknown and in between are the doors.""",9,17 April 2015,"This film is an absolute gem, for both Doors fans, and those looking for a great biopic to watch. Oliver Stone did a great job directing a stellar cast, and combined with a fantastic soundtrack, this film is not one to be overlooked.Val Kilmer was just superb and I felt he really captured the magical and mysterious personality that was Jim Morrison (apparently he sang the songs so well that the real Doors couldn't tell the difference between who was Morrison and who was Kilmer), accompanied with a beautiful, and memorable, performance from Meg Ryan as Morrison's girlfriend Pamela Courson.This film reignited my love for the Doors, and even if you aren't a die-hard fan, I challenge you to watch this fantastic film and come away liking (if not loving) at least one song!",The Doors
159,MJShep87,Excellent Portryal of Jim and the '60s,10,24 June 2005,"Val Kilmer was casted perfectly as Jim Morrison. He looks exactly like him and his voice closely resembles Jim's also.This movie truly captures the turbulent lifestyle of Jim Morrison. This movie explores all aspects of his life from his experimentations with hallucinogenic drugs such as LSD and peyote to his alcoholism and even his wild sex life. The camera acts as a window into the mind of an obsessive and troubled, but extremely talented rock star. It cuts through all the garbage talk about Morrison being some prophet or visionary, as many believe he was, and exposes him for the true drugged-up, troubled human being he was.The whole scene of drug experimentation, sex, and the cultural revolution of the '60s is shown in this movie.",The Doors
160,gc-91472,This movie changed my life,10,11 April 2016,"Oliver Stone's homage to one James Douglas Morrison is one of the most brutally nostalgic, emotionally moving, and savagely honest films about a Rock stars fall from grace that I have ever seen.The film itself is two hours plus, and chronicles The Doors rise to fame and fortune on the back of Morrison's charisma, sexuality, darkness, and poetic lyrics. Fundamentally, the movie's seeds are in what happens to Morrison after the Doors become famous, and focuses primarily on Morrison's complex personality, fueled by fame and fortune, alcohol and drugs, and a young man embedded in the 60's social and political upheaval in the United States.I first viewed this Oliver Stone film after the movie's release circa 1991 - 1993. From the opening of the film, I was enchanted, the recording studio, where Morrison was recording his poetry on his birthday, to the mysterious and dark song, ""Riders on the Storm"" accompanying the first film sequences of the movie were just wonderful.The film is beautifully shot in CinemaScope with state of the art technology of the time (1990's), the color, textures, and cinematography are magnificent, The soundtrack is impeccable, acting superb, and the screenplay is a condensed masterpiece.Val Kilmer plays the role of Jim Morrison in what is his finest performance as an actor, and captures so beautifully, Morrison's complexity, his charm and charisma, his darkness and intelligence, and also Morrison's anxieties. Kilmer deserved the best actor gong for his portrayal of the troubled rock star. The sad pathos of the film and the introduction of ""Death"" as a character in the movie, as what Bergman did in ""The Seventh Seal"", was a stroke of master genius on Oliver Stones part. The whole film took on an almost premonition type of dark journey to his death, in which the protagonist already knew his fate, and was wallowing in this realm for only a short amount of time, brilliant.There are some inaccuracies in the film, although 90% of the movie is based on actual events and real people, and is pretty much in chronological order, Stone has taken license in one or two scenes in order to convey a concept, give context to, or to highlight a particular incident. Morrison was and will always be an enigma, and rightly or wrongly the doors will unfortunately always be subservient to the Jim Morrison myth, the film highlights this in utterly uncompromising terms, which may dismay some fans of the doors, however, this was the reality, as was evidenced in the last two albums without Morrison. They didn't sell, and the remaining doors had lost their appeal without their endearing front man.Morrison was a man in pain, he seemed to have an ongoing psycho- drama with his parents and could not reconcile his differences with them, and this could have led up to what triggered his substance abuse, however we can only speculate about this. I highly recommend seeing this film whether you are a doors fan or not, because it is a brilliant interpretation of a tragic poet, his quest for immortality, his reflection of a society, and the way he perceived it, his magnificent philosophical insight, and his ultimate sacrifice for his art.Glenn Cuthbertson",The Doors
161,donpedro084,Great Rock n Roll Movie,8,6 November 2002,"Possibly one of Val Kilmers best performances as the almost uncanny look alike of Jim Morrison, as well as the rest of the cast. The movie is a bit long and has a few historical mistakes,but really a great movie with great music. A must see for Doors fans.",The Doors
162,donpedro084,I retract my first comment on this movie,8,10 January 2003,"Since I submitted my first comment of this movie I have had time to read actual biographies of Jim and the band. Oliver Stone has made Jim Morrison look like some kind of a monster, and made it seem like he and the rest of the band never got along. This movie butchers the actual history of the Doors. I could say that this movie would be good if it were not based off of an actual band, but rather a fictional one just using Doors songs.",The Doors
163,floatonmaybe,"I love it and hate it , but love it a bit more than I hate it",7,26 July 2007,"The Doors is itself a pretty good film providing entertainment, music, drama, etc. I have read three Doors books or bios and have all their albums. Yes, all of their albums(at least all their regular studio albums that I know of) with and without Jim. The movie is one of my favorites and the band is in my top 3. If you like the Doors then you will or should probably like this movie.Oliver Stone sometimes uses neat special effects and camera angles that enhance the film's quality and enjoyment. I have few complaints about the casting. Val Kilmer does a wonderful job though Jason Patric( The Lost Boys) would have probably done it justice also. The time line is also incorrect through most the movie. For example, Jim was 22 or 23 in the London Fog in 1966, not 21 as he states. One of my biggest complaints is Jim Morrison(Kilmer) has too much of a role and he is portrayed as mostly an inconsiderate, careless, asshole. Despite being the most interesting, idolized, and untouchable person in the band, Morrison is not the Doors. If Ray and Jim didn't meet on the beach that day there may have not been a Doors. According to the Doors books I have read, Jim was a college dropout(Maybe, this is still not clear to me)jobless bum sleeping on a rooftop eating mostly canned baked beans before Ray pieced together the band. Who knows Morrison may have died earlier as a poor bum. The same goes for Robbie and John. The Doors' sound was produced by all 4 guys. I think Jim was a bit crazy at times but the movie seems to exaggerate this. Ray, Robbie, and John are depicted as more mature, boring adults babysitting and not communicating much with Jim, almost hating him. This was not the case in reality.Anyways, I wish the movie would have focused more on the early years of band formation while evening out the character roles as much as possible. My favorite scenes are on the beach, at the Fog and Whiskey, in the desert, and at Ray's beach house for pratice and such.If you haven't seen the movie and are at least a music fan, please watch it a few times.",The Doors
164,simpsonguy27,Cinematic Bliss,9,19 August 2019,"Oliver Stone's The Doors may arguably be the best biographical film of a rock band (with a primary focus on Jim Morrison) to ever grace the silver screen. It all starts with the casting choice of Val Kilmer.Words cannot describe the mere perfection of the decision for Kilmer to be cast as Morrison. The two bear a striking resemblance to one another to the point where sometimes when Morrison is mentioned in passing, I will sometimes see Kilmer's face before the man himself. Not only is the physical aspect similar, but the mentality of his portrayal is captured well to boot. Much like Heath Ledger in Nolan's The Dark Knight, Kilmer did rigorous ""exercises"" in order to make sure his depiction was as genuine as possible. His method acting was taken to a whole new level. His first step was memorizing 50 of The Door's songs. He would sit and listen for hours on end, meticulously noting the approach that Morrison took to each song, including tonality, pitch, and volume (Morrison's voice would become more rugged and deeper as his drinking and overall health declined). Before production on the movie began, Kilmer essentially lived vicariously as the lead singer, dressing in similar wardrobe choices and even going so far as to walk and behave like him as well. The actor was so dedicated to this role, he had to attend therapy sessions since he had so much difficulty getting out of his character.To the film's credit, there were terrific casting choices all around. The costume design and portrayals were executed to a near perfect degree. I particularly liked Crispin Glover's representation of Andy Warhol. In addition to the casting of this movie, the cinematography is nothing to scoff at either. There are many scenes where the characters trip on acid and this is handled very carefully by Stone. The camerawork and effects (I would go into more detail, but I think a film professional might be able to give a better explanation) really give these scenes a trippy vibe and are just enjoyable to watch. There is a scene towards the end that is impressive as well. In real life, it is argued that Morrison may or may not have exposed himself on stage. Stone's workaround to this debatable issue was to have Kilmer strategically place his finger through his zipper to simulate this. Whether or not it was a censorship issue for filming purposes or just to play both sides of the fence, it is easy to say that this was a truly creative way to display this infamous incident.I'll keep this portion short and sweet, as I'm not sure if it was an effects choice or just the way the DVD was manufactured, but there is a consistent grainy filter throughout most, if not all, of the scenes in the movie which makes the film more true to the era it was designed to convey. The writing is also impressive in this motion picture, as much of the dialogue is supposed to be drug-induced and this can be difficult to execute when one is not stoned themselves.Amidst the positive aspects about this movie, there is a prevalent weakness here. As much praise as Kilmer should get for his portrayal of Morrison, the director's choice for some of Morrison's actions are usually brought up for debate. There are multiple instances of him taking his drunkenness (more so, his personality as a whole) to a level that is not realistic with the actual Jim Morrison.At the end of the day, this movie was so precise and careful with the casting, writing, and the depiction of the counterculture. If you are a fan of rock music, or just well-crafted films in general, I would highly recommend this movie. You won't be disappointed.",The Doors
165,DukeWolfenstein,Rocksploitation more than a biopic,4,7 October 2015,"I didn't think rocksploitation was an actual genre until I saw this film - has all the ""rock star"" clichés and little else. Too long and not enough events occur - it's like a long jam session of Light My Fire interrupted by a few events. Stone could've cut an hour of the film and nothing will be missed.If you want a realistic depiction of the Doors, this is not the place. If you want an enjoyable film about a rock band, this is not the place.I wouldn't recommend watching this film as entertainment, but if anyone is considering making a rock film, they should watch this first as a ""What not to do"" guide. If someone wants to make a movie about a rock star with substance abuse problems and nothing else, then it's already been done before. It's called ""The Doors.""That's all the value I see from this movie - a lesson for others to avoid the mistakes that were done here.",The Doors
166,Eviceratum,The Violent Booze Soaked Story of a Wasted Life...,7,20 February 2008,"The Doors, it requires no plot synopsis nor an explanation because the name speaks for itself. The thing that makes this movie hard not to watch is a strange formula; 1 part music, 2 parts music, and 97 parts self destruction.I just saw this movie for the first time today, and as not too big a doors fan I had to look for something else to like in this film and what I found was a serious of excellent performances and bizarre visual elements that make it very hard to look away. Val Kilmer does a good job as Jim Morrison in the fact that his performance makes it hard to determine whether or not Morrison was a man to be loved or hated and was perfectly countered by Meg Ryan showing how he dragged her down with him. The unpredictability of the lead character also kept me going, how he was joking one moment and going psychotic the next. The depiction of the rock God certainly wasn't very flattering and I think it's better that way because it's honest, Jim Morrison was a drug addled alcoholic asshole on a path to self destruction that no one (not even people he loved) could stop.The drug sequences are something that I would usually find unique if it wasn't Oliver Stone, he seems to be quite accustomed to that. I did however enjoy the way that it would be manipulated to seem as if time literally stopped in certain moments in the movie, mixtures of sounds and colors or lack thereof peeling the viewer away from what little normality was already there. Sometimes though it took away from the movie itself, there were times where I think I would have enjoyed these particular moments far more if I'd smoked a joint before they happened.Now for the parts that needed work, I initially had the same problem with this that I had with ""Walk The Line"". I didn't enjoy the fact that one minute we see Morrison as a kid and the next moment he's a 21 year old acid dropping film student in Venice. I don't like when movies jump to the halfway evolution of a character without explaining how it came to be that way. It jumps too quickly into the success of the Doors as if thew whole thing was overnight. This movie is pretty lengthy as it is I know, but it wouldn't hurt to toss in an extra 10 minutes. Another thing was this movie could have lost at least a half hour if it had cut down on unnecessarily long sequences, in particular some of the concert scenes. I don't care about the music, even the Doors can drag on sometimes. And there were other parts but we won't go into it.All together it was a well rounded movie about the downward spiral of one of the most vibrant, overrated (by Morrison's own admission), and ultimately too human for his own good artists of the sixties. It was a sad story about a wasted life told through music and drugs and insanity... but it still could've been better...",The Doors
167,jasontherockstar,"Great film , super band!",9,12 March 2006,"I think the film about the Doors made me become more of a fan of the band. I love the music and i really like the Indian and desert influences around Jim's poetry and music. The film tought me that Jim was affected by an incident involving Indians bleeding on the side of the road when he was a kid. This led to his stardom and i an unfortunate death. Even though Jim is portrayed as being a crazy alcoholic and a cheat and the fact that the film misses out much of the goods points about him, this is what makes the film exciting towards the viewers. Val Kilmar looks like him and even sounds like him. Val could have been a rocker!!! Great movie!!!",The Doors

169,DLeshaw,An Unfortunate Attempt-Doesn't Do the Band Justice,4,12 May 2006,"Even for hard-core Doors fans, Oliver Stone's ""The Doors"" falls far short of portraying the band that rocked the Sixties Music Scene. For beginners, the movie focuses exclusively on Morrison, skillfully portrayed by almost look-alike, Val Kilmer, whose performance as The Lizard King borders on over-the top. The rest of the band is given practically no character, with Manzarek made to look like the only musically-oriented member of the band. Kevin Dillon spends the entire movie looking scared. The movie wallows too much in Morrison's personal life,choosing instead to show a violent, depraved, psychotic side, and less of the tormented poet Morrison actually was. The cinematography at best was amateur. One of the only potential saving graces of the movie, the included two-dozen songs, are poorly placed in the movie. Overall, the movie is an extreme disappointment, and is better titled Jim Morrison: How I learned to stop worrying and commit suicide. Even the best of Doors fans will find this attempt at recreating the band's history a shame to the music, with Kilmer's performance being the only saving grace.",The Doors

When this movie first came out I refused to go watch it for those two reasons alone. I thought the film would be laughable. Well,I do love the Doors and when I found the movie for 99 cents at a thrift store and needed some entertainment for the weekend,I purchased it. Amazed and impressed,I watched it three times! Val Kilmer was incredible,rough and sexy,not the usual arrogant ,pretty boy he plays in so many films. Meg Ryan was beautiful and sensitive. I was surprised to see Kyle McLachlin(strong,sensible but SO cool-he looked like John Sebastin,Loving Spoonful!),Paul Williams,Crispin Glover and Kathleen Quinlan(you must see her-simply amazing!) who all played excellent roles. Val Kilmer would have been my last choice for this role,just by the characters he played in other films,but whoever chose him is a genius because after seeing the film,he was the perfect choice for the role. This movie was quite impressive and is now one of my favorites. I think I will go watch it again now!",The Doors

It shows all about his personal life and all the crazy sh*t that he would do on and off the stage. This is definently one of my favorite movies of all time. Oliver Stone did a great job of portraying this great man's life.  And Val Kilmer should've won an Oscar for playing a character of that stature as well as he did.,The Doors
172,ryanjohnson,general comment,8,2 April 2005,"First thing first, I really enjoyed this film and it is part of my collection. Oliver Stone's vision of remembering Jim was deeply sown with alcoholism and drug abuse juxtaposed with groupie sex and minimal importance on concert performance. (not to far from the truth) To the reviewers that said Stone only scratched the surface of the Doors front man, I agree. However, in the case of Jim Morrison I think that the public yearns for a secret or something ""under the surface"" about icons as Jim Morrison that made them who they are remembered for. Maybe that was it; Jim Morrison was simply a drunk posing as a poet. Although I disagree, to a certain extent there is some truth. I wish that Stone could have focused more on concert performance because that is how the Doors got their fame. The Doors of Perception are locked by the patch within lies the key.

173,officespace000,"The Doors: The Legend, The Music, and Mr. Mojo Risin'",8,7 January 2012,"This movie captures the music, the look, and the overall of the Doors through their relatively short career. Oliver Stone is impeccably true to the music and the look - the musical instruments are perfect and authentic, from Ray Manzarek's Vox Organ to Robby Krieger's Gibson guitar.Val Kilmer does an excellent job as Jim, as do the rest of the actors playing the Doors. The performances are believable and true to the essence of the band.The film spends little time on the writing process, with the exception of a highlight of the film, which is the birth of ""Light My Fire"". The focus is more on the mythology on the band and on Jim himself, the Lizard King.As a Doors' fan, I appreciated the film on many levels, and felt it really got the story right. If you're expecting a detailed biography of the band, you'll be disappointed. However, for an enjoyable story that includes the highlights of the Doors' career, and many of their hits, you'll be pleasantly surprised.Great film!",The Doors
174,joediduca,Great visual film that concentrates on one aspect of a brilliant but troubled rock legend.,9,23 September 2005,"Jim Morrison wrote many of the Doors songs and was a complete drunk by the time he died in 1971. This film depicts Morrison in a very one sided view. Yes he was an alcoholic with a disregard for authority, yes he was on self destruct mode and burnt out quickly reaffirming the James Dean ""Live fast Die young"" motif. But what is missing from Stone's depiction of him was his great intellect,his absurd humour and his natural talent as a composer and vocalist. However it is a wonderfully visual film that takes the viewers on a hallucinogenic ride through drug hazed Los Angeles in the late 60's. It was the first of many films that Stone created in the 90's using an almost dream like quality to evoke the feeling of the turbulent times.Although this picture is not a 100% accurate account of who or what Jim Morrison was it is still very engaging and enjoyable. A good place for someone who is new to the Doors to start.",The Doors
175,jamiecarle,Oliver Stone captures flawed genius with flawed film,8,25 October 2005,"Having just watched The Doors again for the first time in a few years and seeing it for the first time without student pretentiousness blinkering my already frazzled brain, I found that Oliver Stone's film was fragmented on a few levels. Rather than spoil the film, this led to a better realisation of the troubled life of Jim Morrison. Sure, some of the Native American symbolism of Stone was forced on the viewer rather than allowed to be absorbed but this is no surprise to anyone who has ever seen one of his films. This is surely an underlying theme of Oliver Stone's films so it is easy to allow him these indulgences, especially with the strength of the visuals on display in this film.The point of this film was to chronicle the life of what many people refer to as a troubled genius. It is clear right from the start that Morrison is battling his own demons. Becoming a spokesperson for the American Left, which was also trying to find its own voice in sixties, clearly left it's toll on someone who frankly relished the opportunity.Although the film is adequate in telling the life of Morrison in the early days, it is his descent as always, that is fascinating. From his troubled affair with a journalist who became besotted by his presence, to his oblivion through drink and drug's, it is clear that this is where Stone becomes intrigued by his subject. Who could blame him, this is surely the time when most doors fans themselves were wondering if the man was for real. And, unfortunately for most people who did believe in the hype of Jim Morrison, he delivered.Dying when he did, in a bathtub in Paris, left Stone with an unimaginably poignant ending. Here was a man so involved with his own self who embraced the rock and roll lifestyle so completely, that this was the only ending that fitted. Who would hold the man in such high regard today if he was not dead? Look at the Rolling Stones, even Paul McCartney nowadays. Nobody could ever accuse Morrison of selling out. He never had a chance. He lived the life, he suffered for the life. Rightly or wrongly, this is why Jim Morrison will always have people admiring him. It leads to magnificent speculation of his life.In 'The Doors' I feel there is a film even he would admire and say 'That was me.'",The Doors

The movie is entertaining and original. I read the book Riders on the storm and it has a lot of the movie in it. I also read Light my Fire and it has a few things in there also that I saw in the film. Jim Morrison was possessed by the Devil. If you think i am full of it then look closely as his lyrics. He was a great song writer or poet if you want to take it further but he was crazy. I love the guy and I have a poster of him in my room. I like just about every song the Doors have and when it comes to the movie I think it is incredible.

It just portrays Jim as a alcoholic, drug addict maniac. This was one side of him, but he was also a brilliant poet and songwriter and actually a very polite person while sober. I don't know why Oliver Stone had to twist things round so much, because the story would still be very interesting if it was just told straight.

I was 20 years old when the movie was made, and my curiosity about the band had already been started by the auditions of some songs of them. Usually, I don't like the way how the life of the great personalities of the show business are visualized by some directors,because of the lies that been showed sometimes change the truth beyond all the limits. But on this case, the director Oliver Stone was very happy on translate to screen the life and art of the most important rock'n'roll's icon of all the times, the man who brings to music a new way to write lyrics, with a strong poetry, who was a performer and, at the same time, real, the front man who's been followed and imitated by 9 between 10 of the rock'n'roll singers. Backing to the movie, Val Kilmer and Meg Ryan were fabulous, demonstrating a powerful chemistry among them, just like the rest of the cast, that made the history very truly.

There is also the fact that Stone uses The Doors as an outlet for his imagination. He falsifies one hell of a lot of Morrison's life to make the film impact upon the viewer. The concept that Patricia Kennealy chased after Morrison as early as 1967 is false. They did not actually meet until 1969. There is much more that the avid viewer should know about this movie, and it should be researched before mentioning what a great film this is.",The Doors
184,waladd,Val Kilmer's best work,10,6 June 2002,"At some points in this movie you tend to forget that you're not really looking at Jim Morrison, that you're actually watching Val Kilmer in the role of Jim. Val should have received numerous awards for this role, he really knows how to play one f---ed up individual, the late great Jim Morrison.",The Doors
185,rabino,"""The movie will begin in five moments..."" the myth and the film.",10,18 December 2002,"The Doors are one of those bands who have travelled through generations , mantaining the same spirit throughout the decades. Oliver Stone made an extraordinary film, not as a biography, but as a work of art. He wanted to teld the story of the myth, enduring it, not the story of the man. Val Kilmer is at his best, sometimes I got scared with the resemblance, in the most remarcable work of his life so far. Being a fan of The Doors I must say that the relations between scenarios, characters and soundtrack is also truely overwelming. The focus on Jim Morrison is a central aspect of the film and, in my opinion that's the reason why it  the film impresses everybody, even those less familiar with the band's music and reputation. The way Stone films the path from stardom to decadence is one of the key features to understand its success. It is a film to remain a part of history as a document of a generation, and a way to pass the spirit and the music of The Doors to the future fans. ""The movie will begin in five moments, the mindless voice announced...""",The Doors
186,ortep511,Great Movie,10,14 March 2003,"This is one of the best biography movies of all time.  Val Kilmer did an outstanding job as Jim Morrison.  The movie followed the book biography of the late Morrison, and was true in most details.  The story sells itself, but the actors make it real.",The Doors
187,lettersnumbersperiods,A True Disservice,4,27 July 2010,"You know, as dynamic and visceral a filmmaker as Oliver Stone can be, his deliberately subjective assessment of his subjects is not always appropriate. In the case of ""The Doors"", I will say that I find Stone's symbolic pulp imposition of 60's and 70's culture onto the titular individuals inappropriate at least, near slanderous at worst. Based on interviews, concert footage, essentially any real documentation of The Doors it is more than clear that these were articulate, talented and sensitive individuals...something almost at odds with Stone's bombastic and exploitative treatment (or perhaps his real perspective on the group). If Densmore, Krieger and Manzarek are considered peripheral players to the sensationalized events of the film, perhaps they should consider themselves lucky. Jim Morrison (played, albeit, with real intention and commitment by Val Kilmer) is made into a truly abhorrent caricature, devoid of all the subtlety and contradiction that made him a genuinely compelling performer and lyricist. The pathetic and near-transcendent humanity of Morrison in the midst of self-destruction and the complex interplay of the group's playing is completely overlooked by Stone in this film in favor of - what else- kinky sex, copious amounts of drugs and petty gestures of rock recreation. While the excess of this story may be real, the human was too.",The Doors
188,irishmoviemadman,greatest film on a rock band ever!!!!,8,21 November 2003,"As a huge fan of The Doors and Oliver Stone I had big expectation's for this film and wasn't dissapointed. Stone done  a great job with this incredibly realistic portrait of the rock band The Doors. Val Kilmer is a real mirror image of the rock and roll god Jim Morrison and in my opinion plays the part perfectly, with great sutilty and also with the unpredictable erratic behaviour as Jim was known for with his drug and alcohol abuse. When the film came out in an interview Val Kilmer said that he wasn't Jim Morrisons biggest fan and disagreed with his destructive ways. None of this is evident throughout the film as his performance is certainly for me a career best for Val but im sure he has the personality to be a regular leading man, but  he has not reached his potential as a serious big name actor like Tom Cruise,Edward Norton,Brad Pitt etc...I highly recommend this film to anyone interested in the band and for me this film is right up there with Oliver Stones JFK ,Platoon and the highly underrated Salvador. I think Oliver Stone is still the greatest director around today but his films of the last few years [any Given Sunday,U-Turn )are not nearly near his high standard.Lets just cross our fingers and hope with his latest film in the making Alexander the Great (played by none other than my fellow countryman Colin Farrell ) he can reach the same hights he has with his other work.Sit back with this enjoyable film with your feet up and many tins of beer and enjoy the ride....",The Doors
189,Helvetejavlar,No flaws for the king,10,2 September 2005,"There's no flaws or misleading information in this movie. It's a known fact what kind of lifestyles rockstars live/lived, even Elvis has his share of dirt dug up over a long period of time. I don't care if some kids rented the movie thinking it was a good movie to watch a Saturday night, got disappointed n thought they would share their view of it here. I also don't care about the poetry ppl saying the movie draws the attention away from Morrisons talented poetry n that the music comes second. If Morrison never made music he would just be another weirdo in a smokey basement reading to ppl in berets and all those great songs would never have been made. Music/songs first n everything else second. He was a rockstar in blood n the movie is only poor to the masses that never liked rock in the first place.",The Doors
190,marky_swan,Kilmer's Spotlight,9,29 August 2004,"Oliver Stone has impressed us even more. Stone's masterpiece has shown rock legend Jim Morrison in this visually stunning and excellent work of art. To top that off would be Val Kilmer's best performance, nobody could have filled Jim Morrison's shoes as much as Kilmer. The unusual camera angles, the cinematography and the soundtrack provided by the Doors really makes this more of an amazing artwork. The film clearly deserves more award nominations than it got, everything from start to end was mind-bending and head frying. The film is mostly for Doors fans but is still a great film in anyones eyes. This truly is the best biography of any rock legend. The films is most definently deserving of 10 stars",The Doors
191,knute1,Oliver Stone Delivers Drug Addiction,9,2 April 2017,"The Doors broke onto the scene in the late '60s with a ""Carnival Music"" sound. Jim Morrison takes you for a ride that could be your last. Follow the ""Pied Piper"" of Rock and Roll to your doom. The Merry go Round doesn't stop unless you can dislodge yourself and fly away. As Pamela Courson discovered the ""Magic Ride"" with Jim is short and addictively deadly.The Doors reflected the constant Jungle Warfare in Viet Nam - ""The End"", ""The Musics Over"" and several other tunes drag you down into the depths of despair - showing endless war and strife. Jim and his massive alcohol and drug addiction ""Lit His Fire"" alright, along with countless other lost souls.We survived the War and the Revolution and we're still here - we are the ""Beautiful Friend"" that Morrison sings about. Addiction took many of us and is still reaping it's deadly harvest. We were able to detach ourselves from Morrison and his Death Spiral - we survived to look back at his destruction along with those that followed him. Oliver Stone showed the uncontrolled Jim Morrison and the destructive power he wielded. No one could stop or prevent the eventual outcome. I however lived to learn from this legendary ""Pied Piper"".",The Doors
192,claudia-macovei08,Amazing portrail of Morrison,9,13 August 2021,"After seeying this film for the second time, I concluded that Val Kilmer might be the most underated actor in Hollywood! If this was not an Oscar worthy performance, I don't know what is! Watching the rise and fall of the ledgend that was Jim Morrison, before our eyes, at times it was hard to remember that what I was seeying onscreen was not, in fact, the actual Jim! The voice, the manner, the presence... just breathtaking! It is beyond me why this film and this role, did not get the recognition it deserves from the film academies around the world (no Oscar, no Bafta, no Palm D'or) it's just sad..",The Doors
193,dhunds83,Doors of Perception,7,30 April 2005,"The director has lived the life of Jim the bohemian. A ride on the blue bus!!! dialogues true to him, and sequences to match. Val Kilmer lives Morrison as well, his character could have been a little less intense. The Legend - Jim Morrison # ""The most important kind of freedom is to be what you really are. You trade in your reality for a role. You trade in your sense for an act. You give up your ability to feel, and in exchange, put on a mask. There can't be any large-scale revolution until there's a personal revolution, on an individual level. It's got to happen inside first."" # ""I think of myself as an intelligent, sensitive human being with the soul of a clown, which always forces me to blow it at the most important moments."" # ""I think the highest and lowest points are the important ones. Anything else is just... in between.

It just got too much for me to really stomach and so I put an end to it one glorious evening.""",The Doors
194,killxforxthis,An unusually good film,8,18 July 2005,"This movie follows the poetic journey of the late Jim Morrison, lead singer of The Doors. Starting with Jim meeting Ray Manzarek and forming The Doors. After playing their music at a few places and being pulled off stage because Jim Morrisons wild antics, they land a record contract. And with a large demand for their music The Doors became huge. And Morrison even bigger. He refuses to play along, getting arrested, doing drugs, and making himself available to any women he can. With time Morrisons actions threatens the future of The Doors.I liked this film because Oliver Stone wasn't afraid to show Morrison's outrageous actions on and off the stage. Also because it seemed to show the friction between the band members and Morrison. It seemed to me to show a very good depiction of Jim Morrison's life. I would recommend this film to any fans of The Doors music. I would also recommend this film to those who don't like the music because this might be enough to get them interested.",The Doors
195,ankit-arora,shouldn't have tried,6,11 August 2008,"OK so this guy wanted to make a movie on the doors. this is where it starts to go wrong. there's nothing wrong with the movie as such, its actually pretty well done, the script and direction is pretty good. but the point is, val kilmer doesn't even come close to doing jim morrison,or his hair, any justice, and the rest of the cast aren't that awesome either. add to that that kilmer cant sing, and that the movie is 140 minutes long, you have a pretty mediocre effort which doesn't even begin to bring out the charisma of the doors that you're hit with if you just listen to their music or watch recorded concert performances.only watch if you're a die hard fan who cannot live with the thought that there's a doors movie they haven't watched.",The Doors
196,redmesamountain,"Great Performance in great, but flawed film",8,15 December 2015,"I want to add a few words, because reading many of the reviews, it's apparent that many did not get the message of the film or who Morrison was and Val Kilmer tried to be. The Morrison of the film was a Dionysius-figure. Dionysius was a god of the ancient Greeks who was honored by rites in which people went wild for a prescribed period of time. It was kind of like the modern New Years Eve or the New Orleans Mardi Gras, or a wild rock festival, but in context of religious rites.Morrison's books at the beginning of the film show that he was media savvy before becoming famous. It's in the original script, but was unfortunately cut out of the film. He very much wanted to get power as the native-American shamans did, through ritual, drugs, dance and trance.All the fore-mentioned, except the holidays, are a part of religious practice. In the film, Morrison tells his friend that ""people want something sacred"". He was trying to introduce that into the rock music of the time, while most other white musicians were ripping off licks of the black bluesmen. That's why he was such a sensation at the time, because he was so different.Questions as to whether Kilmer/Morrison were nice guys, did too many drugs, and so on, are totally beside the point. What Morrison wanted was for everyone to lose their rational, everyday mentality for a sacred trance, a druggy religiosity... anything but what was evident in the 60s, i.e. Viet Nam, poverty, racism, and people choosing sides in a political struggle inside the US. The 60s must be seen in relation to what came before, the Eisenhower 50s, a time of plenty, but of little progress on any other front, especially music, except for black music.Oliver Stone does a good job of getting these messages across. The middle sections of the film are the best, the concert scenes, the confrontation with the East Coast establishment, the excess in life, art and substances. Btw, excess in these items was and is still considered one of the ways to knowledge, believe it or not.Hats off to Val Kilmer for his wonderfully talented impersonization of Jim Morrison. A great performance, probably the greatest of his career. He walks, talks and sings the songs as Morrison did. Read more about the film if you want to know how hard Kilmer and Stone prepared for the role. Read the original script to get more background to what the film says, because a lot of context didn't make it into the film.Finally, it's great to go back to a time when things were more free, more uninhibited, before people were hung up in digital toys trance, as they are now. Nothing as strong is going on now. The 60s will return in a different form, as will all the other eras, as they have for millenia.",The Doors
197,meitia,About Meg Ryan as Pam,10,14 September 2005,"I was born in 1979 and absolutely after The Doors in ultimate glory and Jim Morrison was death. Before I watched the film, I only heard about The Doors just in small pieces part. But now I realize that The Doors is much more amazing more than just drugs, sex and rock n'roll story... I think no man can directing better than what Oliver Stone did. And no man will perfectly being Jim except Val Kilmer. But I have sadly say that, they should re-casting Pamela. Coz Meg Ryan looked just not good to be Pamela. I really don't know what the real Pamela was look like, I wasn't even born yet. But still Meg Ryan looked too sweet to consume drugs or even smoke a pot",The Doors
198,ReyAce,Not the story it should have been... but watchable,7,15 October 2005,"One thing you can say for Stone is that he knows how to make a good LOOKING movie. Unfortunately he plays so fast and loose with the truth that the end result is more a work of fiction rather than of history. Such is the case with ""The Doors"", a movie that any real Doors fan knows is only a caricature of the band's front-man, Jim Morrison.Stone took the most sensational moments in Morrison's life and focused on it entirely, the end result being that he captured only a mere sliver of Morrison's true life and personality. While the film medium as a whole has never been as good as books when documenting someone's life or career, Stone's portrayal of Morrison unforgivably verges on fiction in its artistic license. Absent is the sensitive, intelligent person who many - including himself - considered a true poet, missing is the person who acknowledged the ridiculousness of his celebrity and sought to destroy it one glorious night in Miami, and equally missing is the source of the person who WAS James Douglas Morrison. As comedian Denis Leary once put it after seeing the movie, ""Here I can sum it up for you - I'm a drunk, I'm a nobody, I'm a drunk, I'm famous, I'm a drunk, I'm dead!"" Not exactly the best summation for a man whose cultural contributions to American music can still be felt 35 years after his death. Nice going, Oliver.On the positive side the movie looks incredibly good, (most likely due to cinematographer Robert Richardson rather than Stone himself), and the viewer does come away with a feel for Morrison's charisma, stage presence, and mystical inclinations. Val Kilmer had deep shoes to fill and very convincingly does so - perhaps the only person on planet earth capable of bringing such a complicated character as Morrison to the screen. The rest of the cast also is well-placed, even though the characters on the screen were considerably different than who they were portraying. (Thanks again, Oliver.)All in all, the movie is worth watching. If you're an intrigued first-timer being introduced to the music and legacy of The Doors from this movie, take it with a grain of salt and do yourself a favor - go out and get the biographies of former band members Ray Manzarek and John Densmore, then watch the live concert material available. You'll be glad you did.",The Doors
199,morningsong89,"A good movie But a better title would have been ""break on through""",8,24 April 2011,"The only reason I say that is because the movie really wasn't about the Doors and more about Jim Morrison. The excesses of a Man who really didn't wish to be famous for the things he was famous for(Good looks, Long hair Etc). He wished to be famous for the words he created. So the movie tells the story of the spirit of the sixties also the excesses. I just recently re watched this movie. I first saw it in theaters.Although I wasn't very familiar with the Doors I was intrigued and captivated by the portrayal of Jim Morrison. From the very beginning of Jim being in the car with his parents to each time after he is on the screen you almost could feel the heat that was building within this man. As if the Doors were just a backdrop to Jim's artistic masterpiece. I feel that Oliver Stone was simply paying tribute to the man who probably set him on his way movie making destiny. The wild concert scenes were interesting to see that concert going and the way people enjoy themselves at concerts has not changed much. I believed that the Doors were so short lived was because that the band or, Ray Manzarek put so much stock and interest into Jim Morrison's antics and profound words that they didn't pit much effort in making the music just as strong as the words. So in doing so the music became background instead of sharing the spotlight with the words. Do I think Oliver showed that? Well kinda, as in certain scenes he speaks on the division in the band. Such as when they were at Andy Warhol's party. Jim Morrison in this portrayal was simply again everybody but he was more against those that appreciated him than those who didn't. To him everything was a game something to be toyed with and see how far to the thresholds it can be pushed before it pushes back or breaks. Especially the woman in his life. Of course if you are familiar with the Doors you already know what Morrison's outcome was. But,I believe this movie gives more of an insight of just how tortured this soul was and how because of the whole ""Free to be me"" Sixties maybe if some kind of intervention was imposed we might still have Jim Morrison with us< But would that be a good thing, See the movie and then answer.",The Doors
