0,SnoopyStyle,some compelling scenes,6,10 December 2014,"In December 6, 1989, disgruntled 25-year-old student Marc Lépine shoot 28 people and then killed himself in École Polytechnique in Montreal. He aims his anger at feminists and blames his failures on them. This is a dramatized version of the true events. Maxim Gaudette plays the unnamed killer. Valérie (Karine Vanasse), Stéphanie (Evelyne Brochu) and Jean-François (Sébastien Huberdeau) are fellow mechanical engineering students and friends. The film follows these four characters before, during and after the incident.Director Denis Villeneuve shots this in black and white. It gives a cold feel to the movie. I think the killer's writing is chilling but the minutia of the fellow students' lives are boring. The only exception is the interview for the internship. The black and white is quite effective during the shooting incident. There are a lot of comparison to Gus Van Sant's Elephant. The main difference for me is that this is a real incident. I almost never call for a strict reenactment but this needs that kind of detail. I would prefer that the 20 minutes shooting spree be recreated perfectly.",Polytechnique
1,kosmasp,Bang!,8,9 November 2009,"The movie starts off with a bang and if you don't know what this is about (like me when I watched this, I hadn't read anything about it), then you will be awed by this very strong beginning. While it's almost like a documentary, it is very strong and has very good natural performances! It's not for the faint hearted and it will be a very intense and strange watching experience. You can't say that it will entertain you in the normal sense of that word, but it will be gripping and it will be a movie that you won't forget that easily. Whether you like it or not, it is grim and it is down and dirty.",Polytechnique
2,christopher-underwood,"quiet, subdued, calm and effective account of a mass slaughter",8,22 January 2021,"There is a beauty that pervades this movie, despite its awful subject matter, and perhaps that and the constantly falling snow, help imbue this with a sadness all the more profound. I was confused as to why there was no resistance or assistance and whether it was a hair colour change at the end that added to my confusion but none of this affected my feeling of reverence towards the film itself or its director. I'm not sure if I had seen this upon release I would have imagined Denis Villeneuve would be equipped to go on to make a successful sequel to Blade Runner a remake Dune or to tackle Cleopatra but the talent is certainly evident, even in this quiet, subdued, calm and effective account of a mass slaughter.",Polytechnique
3,lasttimeisaw,Cinema Omnivore - Polytechnique (2009) 7.3/10,7,15 May 2021,"""Valérie (Vanasse) is one of the fortunate survivors of the ordeal (does she suffers from the survivor's guilt?), and before that, she has a first taste of working-place sexism when she is interviewed for an internship, and her classmate Jean-François (Huberdeau) is also on the spot, being the stronger sex, he is spared by the killer with other males, but he seems to be the only one who shows some valor when all hell breaks loose. And after the fact, he is tormented by mounting guilt that he hadn't done more to prevent the mass killing (a typical messiah complex), whose ramifications are immeasurably grave, varying from individual to individual.""read my full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks.",Polytechnique
4,sddavis63,An Interesting Movie That Fails To Add Anything To Our Understanding Of The Event,7,7 February 2010,"One of the darkest and most tragic events in Canadian history was surely the 1989 ""Montreal Massacre"" in which a number of female engineering students in a Montreal college were shot and killed by a misogynistic, feminist-hating gunman. This movie is based on those events, although changing the identities of everyone in the movie to the extent that none of the characters were even named as far as I recall. The movie begins with a long recital of a letter by the gunman expressing his hatred of women, and it closes with a long recital of a letter by one of the victims (who survived) expressing how the shooting had impacted her. Between those closing narrations, the story might best be described as ""minimal."" There's very little dialogue of any kind between any of the characters. The movie focuses more on the reactions of the students as the gunman wanders through the building, shooting any women he encounters. It's shot in black and white, which gives a somewhat ""eerie"" feeling to this, and it is very suspenseful; the viewer certainly feels the sense of helplessness and chaos that must have been felt by the students. This movie is quite reminiscent of the American movie ""Elephant,"" which was based on the Columbine shooting. I preferred ""Elephant"" - I thought it made better use of the school setting than this one did. I can't say that I was really keeping track, but I thought this movie also exaggerated the event a bit. The Montreal Massacre was bad enough as it was; in this far more women seemed to be shot than actually were shot in the event itself - although, as I said, I wasn't really keeping track. The best part of this movie is the suspense that's involved. One doesn't really learn anything about the Montreal Massacre. Marc Lepine (the name of the real shooter) was a misogynistic feminist- hater. We already knew that. So, perhaps one wonders what the purpose of this movie was. The opening captions say it was to honour the women killed, and their names did appear in a scroll at the movie's end, but I confess that I honestly didn't think it succeeded in that goal. It was a dramatic enough portrayal of a school-shooting, but it adds nothing to our understanding of the event. 7/10",Polytechnique
5,OJT,Unconventinal and grim storytelling with lots of film references,8,18 October 2013,"This Canadian movie is really some different approach on a school massacre movie, made by someone who obviously had a lot to say. It's shockingly grim and brutal, yet made with artful eyes and a close look to details, made by a future film genius.We're immediately drawn into the story, which tells about the horrific shootings at the technical high school in French speaking Montreal in Canada in December 1989. We meet both the shooter and the victims in a film which makes an everyday event like school is, to be a nightmare. The shooter was a young man which have lost his way in life, the meaning of it all, blaming women's liberation, and women in general. It was a great shock to the peaceful Canadian nation, giving the country a shell shock. A true depicted tragedy, here recreated with a horrific feel of the reality in it.The film has lots of film references. It's filmed in a Hitchcockian style. Some scenes and sounds are even inspired by Psycho. The film is made in black and white, which adds to this feel. The film would have been unnecessary gory if the blood had been red. It's in many ways very similar to Gus Van Sant's Elephant Camera moments are excellent. Angles are eventfully made and at times astonishingly beautiful, adding to the artistic feel. Music is scarce, ambient and adding to the feel. Both things makes us remember this film. The walking in corridors of the school is also quite similar. I also found similarities in the film language with the Swedish ""Låt den rette komma in"" (Let the right one in). Wonderful and great acted by the main role here. He is terrifyingly without any reason to carry on his life.Not longer than necessary, which today is a blessing, when we see long movies dragging the story out. A well made film, which forces you to reflect on the event, and others like it. Kudos to the involved. Watch out for director Villeneuve, which gas already made some great stuff. He's gonna make a real important movie in the near future. Actually he right now has got his two latest films, 2011 Oscar nominated ""Incendies"" and the fresh smash hit ""Prisoners"", both with 8,2 rating here on IMDb. What a film maker!",Polytechnique
6,Ben_Cheshire,The value of human life.,10,17 June 2015,"Denis Villeneuve's Polytechnique (2009) is as far away from his later Enemy (2013) as I could imagine. It is pure and stark, informed by its subject matter: a 1989 school shooting in Montreal, targeting women. It looks great in black and white, which creates a sombre atmosphere.This film is a testament to the importance of story and substance. The cerebral Enemy never really justified its existence to me. Also, unlike the bloated Enemy, which wore out its welcome after 15 minutes, this film is engrossing through its conservative 75 minute run time. The film is profoundly disturbing, and just plain profound. It is a sensitive film that evokes the barbarism of murder, while celebrating the value of human life.10/10",Polytechnique
7,Seth_Rogue_One,Meh,4,28 July 2016,"I wasn't terribly impressed by this movie, in fact at times I found it rather boring, especially the last 20 minutes which felt a bit pointless. The first 40 minutes were alright though, even though I have no idea what the point was in filming it all in black & white (didn't know it was gonna be and the poster is slightly misleading as that is indeed in colour) it's set in 1987 after all not 1957, but I'm sure many think that that was a brilliant idea.Anyway, lack of colours aside, yeah I wasn't terribly impressed with it, you don't get to know the characters much, or what made the killer actually snap (what made him hate feminists remains a mystery). I mean I understand that maybe they didn't want to take too many liberties with the script, but maybe it would have worked better as a documentary instead. And then we'd get a little more insight as well.The true story of which it's based is of course awful but that doesn't make the story anymore engaging, at least for me, certain others disagree and that's fine good for them.",Polytechnique
8,Movi3DO,Can't believe this but I was bored,5,19 October 2021,"A reenactment of the real-life tragedy in Canada, and not much more than that. I don't see how this movie served anything for the victims from the event. After a quick search online, I saw that there's a lot of controversy regarding the motive and aftermath. And yeah this movie didn't contribute anything to the conversation. The attempt to add some background to the characters didn't really do much for me.No offense but, for only an hour and 15 minutes, this felt like a big stretch from a 30 minutes short film. The event was tragic but I was bored out of my mind in many scenes.Overall, too dragged out. 5/10.",Polytechnique
9,rgcustomer,Another missed opportunity,7,7 January 2010,"I was put off by one of the very first things you see in this film, which is a statement in which the filmmakers hope to have their cake and eat it too. They claim it's ""based on a true story"" but they then disrespect the families by saying all characters have been fictionalized. It's the ultimate disrespect to profit (via cash or fame) on the misfortune of others, while not even telling their story. We all know that far fewer people would have chosen to see this movie if it was titled ""Gately College"" or something.While I wasn't expecting a documentary, I was expecting something true to the facts. Now I'm left with the problem of figuring out whether anything in the film was true at all. Did we learn anything about the shooter? Did we learn anything about the victims? Did we learn anything about the responders? No.Having said that, it did contain some of the most intense shooting scenes I've seen in a film, and for some reason I was also struck by the images of trees. But I was not impressed by the self-indulgent upside-down camera angles.I think it probably is superior to Gus Van Sant's Elephant (Columbine) film, although it does follow in the same vein of being almost entirely devoid of content. If this is going to be the way that directors and writers depict traumatic mass murders, then they need to stop it.",Polytechnique
10,steiner-sam,One of the most emotionally draining movies I've seen,8,29 June 2021,"This is a fictional account of the 1989 Montreal massacre in which 14 women who were engineering students were killed by a man who hated ""feminists.""The film follows four characters, mostly on the day of the shootings. The murderer (Maxim Gaudette) had tried to join the military but failed. He plans to kill women, followed by his own suicide.Valérie (Karine Vanasse) and Stéphanie (Evelyne Brochu) are roommates and classmates at Polytechnique Montreal. Valérie is applying for an internship in mechanical engineering. She succeeds but is treated condescendingly by the interviewer. They both attend a class that is the first one entered by the murderer.Jean-François (Sébastien Huberdeau) is in the same class with Valérie and Stéphanie, and has borrowed some classnotes from Valérie. When the murderer orders all the men from the classroom, Jean-François leaves with the rest, albeit reluctantly. He runs to the security office and asks them to call the police. He finally returns to the classroom and is devastated by what he sees. Over time he is unable to cope with his sense of guilt for leaving.The film then switches back to the experience of Valérie and Stéphanie and the murderer. Valérie and Stéphanie are both shot, but Valérie survives. Finally, we see the murderer's final rampage and his death.The film ends with Valérie in a good relationship and discovers she is pregnant. She has a good position but is haunted by dreams of the murderer every day.This is one of the most emotionally draining movies I've seen. It is enhanced by being in black & white, and the cinematography is excellent. So much is communicated by visuals; there are long sections without dialogue. ""Quebec in winter"" is one of the characters. And the terror of knowing what is coming is palpable.There are some questions about the storyline. Why did no one immediately pull a fire alarm? The police are never visible in the film.",Polytechnique
11,chron,Cinematically Beautiful View Into an Ugly Event,9,29 April 2019,"As a piece of cinema, this is truly a sight to behold. The filming is beautiful in its ability to tell the story of a horrific shooting in Montreal in 1989. The black and white filming and the direction remind of the ""Dekalog"" by Krzysztof Kieslowski.The acting is exceptional. The performance by a young Karine Vanasse is powerful in its understated subtlety.The story is deeply moving. This type of plot isn't for everyone, but if realistic drama is enjoyable to you, as it is to me, then you will be impressed by the quality of this movie.",Polytechnique
12,noahgibbobaker,Great source material.,6,27 August 2020,"Polytechnique is Denis Villeneuve' third feature film, for me this film does not compare to anything he has made since. It tells the story of the tragic ecole polytechnique massacre or the Montreal massacre, a mass shooting that took place at an engineering school affiliated with the university of montreal. The shooting was on the seventh of december 1989. 14 women were killed, 10 were injured and 4 men were also hurt. The killer, Marc Lepine had complained about women working non-traditional jobs for some time and claimed he was ""fighting feminism"" by murdering these young people. Lepine killed himself after killing as many women as he could. He wrote a suicide note that blamed feminists for ruining his life.There are a lot of things I appreciate about this film. Having the film in black and white is a smart choice that worked well, the cinematography is also pretty great except, all the actors did a great job and the end to Jeff's story was tastefull and well executed.Despite liking a lot of polytechnique I think it was overly preachy and conveyed the themes of feminism with little to no subtlety, for example the scene where Valerie is trying to get an internship. Conveying the themes and ideas is something Villeneuve has really improved on. I also feel like I should point out I am very pro-feminist and frankly I think it's disgusting that woman aren't treated the same as men.The killers plan is stupid. I don't know how accurate the film is to the actual event, so I should rephrase. In the film the killers plan is stupid. If there was more than one guy (Jean) trying to help people who were injured the situation could have been better. Some students who were watching him reload his gun could have got up and tried to stop him then he would have no rounds in his gun, then it's one person against the entire university. The killer was also only one person, a group of people from behind could have knocked him down and taken his gun or beat him. All my criticisms here are about the film, I'm not trying to be disrespectful to the horrific event.Most of my complaints about polytechnique are pretty minor for most people but I find silly, careless mistakes hard to get over, especially when most of the film is presented carefully and pretty well. You should check this one out, it's not my thing but you might like it I don't know.",Polytechnique
13,RealLiveClaude,Troubling account of a tragedy.,9,8 February 2009,"Before what happened in Columbine and similar recent events, there was this night of December 6th, 1989.Students were either studying, having a good time or just speaking each other in the cafeteria. In between, a troubled and rejected young man enters the Polytechnique institution in Montreal in search of killing some ""feminists"", somewhat responsible for his ruined life...Shot in black and white, the effect is troubling. All we are left is with a lot of questioning starting with this single word: Why ? Good acting, good photography and a story which is moving, similar to ""United 93"" which was linked with a far worse tragedy.A movie to see, either in French or English (not dubbed...)",Polytechnique
14,Gresh854,Sufficient Return For A Now Legendary Director,6,8 February 2019,"Denis Villeneuve's Polytechnique is a plain sailing yet, formidably assembled (re)debut. It's fascinating to witness how the currently acclaimed mastermind (re)started his full-lengthed movie career with an indie that tackles school shootings and, astonishingly enough, the common ignorance towards feminism. Villeneuve's-nearly homestyled-like-black and white, flashback is-in excess-a promisingly persuading drama/thriller for those planning on careering in the film industry. (Verdict: C+)",Polytechnique
15,ocosis,Heartbreaking.,7,20 December 2020,"It's heartbreaking that this actually happend. The characters, for the film, were fictionalised, but Polytechnique shows a glimpse of what those innocent young people would have gone through. And it's truly saddening.Handled as delicately as possible as the subject matter dictates, Denis Villeneuve's film is a haunting, and a deeply moving account, of an event in close history, that should never have taken place.",Polytechnique
16,Craig_McPherson,"A celluloid memorial to the victims, their families, and survivors",8,15 February 2009,"On December 6, 1989, Marc Lepine wrapped his Ruger Mini-14 semi automatic rifle in a plastic garbage bag, filled the pockets of his coat with ammunition, and headed off to class at the Montreal's Ecole Polytechnique, the engineering branch of the University of Montreal. By the time he was through, fourteen women lay dead, and another ten women and four men were in critical condition. Lepine culminated his misogynistic rampage and wretched existence with a bullet to his head, leaving behind a rambling three page letter railing against feminists who had turned society against him and ruined his life and everything good that had been created by man.Even today the magnitude of the tragedy runs deep in Montreal's collective psyche, and its into this minefield that the film Polytechnique dares to tread, stirring strong sentiments from the public and critics alike for recounting an event whose wounds still live in the consciousness of victims families and survivors.Filmed in stark black and white, and shot twice, once in French and again in English using the same cast, Director Denis Villeneuve imbues the film with an almost suffocating foreboding as a pallor of death hangs over the day like the snow that gently falls throughout. Rather than dwell on Lepine, he instead shifts the focus to two fictional students, Valérie (Karine Vanasse) and Jean-François (Sébastien Huberdeau), each bringing the perspective of their respective gender to the story.By framing events through the lives of these two, Polytechnique packs a most powerful punch. With the exception of a bone chilling beginning, Lepine's murderous rampage virtually plays second fiddle to the story of Valérie and Jean-François, which is how Villeneuve wanted it. He studiously avoids dwelling on death, and shifts the film's emphasis to that of life, grappling with tragedy head on, and the aftermath of anguish that exploded that day like so many bullets from Lepine's gun.This isn't some sensationalist gory ode to a mass murderer, but rather a memorial to the victims of that day. It's not that often you see that in a movie, which makes watching Polytechnique an act of remembrance, and a cause to reflect.",Polytechnique
17,tmpsvita,It could be a true masterpiece,7,18 April 2018,"It is difficult to be able to speak/write about films like this that cover events to say the least dramatic and, given the indelible mark they leave in global history but especially the place where they occurred, important.
Because if misunderstood you risk appearing disrespectful to those who have passed through their skin those certain tragic events; and the same is true for those who make them.
However, after this premise, I will try to review this ""Polytechnique"", a film that had all the potential to be an unforgettable masterpiece but that is content to undoubtedly be a good film without excelling and exploiting all its potential.
Definitely Villeneuve as a director does an excellent job that confirms once again his great skills that will then find their maximum splendor in his subsequent films, such as ""Arrival"", ""Blade Runner 2049"" and ""Sicario""; with excellent shots and beautiful long shots, his direction proves to be mature, conscious and very clear, the black and white, here really beautiful, is then a touch of class.
Needless to say, the film hits and excites, especially in the scenes in which the massacre takes place, with images, implicit and explicit, strong and difficult to absorb. We must admit, however, with the maximum respect possible, that a film with a true story of this type and this importance to the shoulders, can easily moves.
It seems that this was also understood by Villeneuve himself and the writers that for the rest of the film, so all that comes before and after the massacre and not during, treat every aspect superficially, also because of an excessively short duration.
A film that then leaves too little space and time to the true emotions of the characters, before and after the fact, and that then analyzes and explores the psychological aspect of the event in a too hastily way. 
The same figure of the murderer is not analyzed and characterized satisfactorily; his motivations, his person / figure, what made him get up to that point and that turned him into a killer, all this is addressed in a way that does not convince enough or while some of these aspects is not really considered .
The same applies to the other protagonists of the film, they are very poorly characterized and this makes it impossible to identify with them the psychological impact suffered both during the massacre and afterwards too superficially.
Very good, however, the melancholic soundtrack that seeks, together with the images, to create an intense and suggestive atmosphere, in this we say that it manages however remains an atmosphere too thin, easy to break, in fact we are easily distracted, and not manages to remain constant or incisive enough to remain even after the end of the film.
Also for this reason the film, although objectively of excellent quality, at least technical, is too superficial and short, which makes it weak and easy to forget. Too bad because it could be a true masterpiece.",Polytechnique
18,TheAnimalMother,Early Film From A Budding Master,7,21 August 2021,"An amazing little French Canadian film about the Quebec massacre. Personally I recommend watching everything Denis Villeneuve has made. This guy is among the greatest living directors in the world right now and he is definitely making some of the most interesting films of our time...Incendies, Prisoners, Arrival, etc. This is one of the films Denis made before he became well known. I've seen everything he's made now except for his newest version of Dune, which I'll check out in the theatre when it opens in October. Every single one of his films was well worth the watch! Forget the overhyped Fincher and Nolan of the newer generation of directors, this guy easily wipes the floor with them. In my view, Denis is definitely the most interesting filmmaker alive today that hasn't made anything prior to the mid 1990's. 7/10.",Polytechnique
19,GethinVanH,Disturbing portrayal of the Montreal Massacre,8,27 August 2009,"This is an incredibly disturbing fictionalized account of the 1989 massacre. None of the characters in the movie are real people, except maybe the killer, Mark Lepine, but the movie probably doesn't want you to think of the killer as him either.The movie is disturbing. That's fitting because who would have predicted such an incident back then when school and university shootings were hardly the norm? This was the largest mass-killing at a school or university at the time. What made this incident even more disturbing was that the killer had a sexist agenda. He killed 12 women and no men.The movie give focus to the killer, a male classmate of the female students at Polytechnique as well as some of the female students. The killer is shown as disturbed man who at the beginning tries to kill himself, gives up, then visits his mother, before going on his rampage. He's calm and focused as he walks around the halls shooting women. Apparently this is how it really happened according to interviews.The movie also shows a male classmate who has female friends in the classroom where the killer originally starts the massacre. The incident obviously affected women gravely but I'm glad it showed men as well. This character was intended to show that not all men are as brutal and insane as the killer (obviously). But it also shows his pain in survival and how helpless he felt being separated from the women. There's always survival guilt in school shootings but there was obviously a lot of survival guilt for the men here. That's shown, I'm glad it was.The incident is also shown again from the women's perspective. It's plain disturbing. I don't think the movie ever crosses the line into sensationalism. The whole movie is in black and white which makes it more like video surveillance footage from 1989. It also tones down the more graphic parts of the movie where there's blood.The movie isn't for the faint of heart. I think it is a story which should be told even 20 years after the original incident. I was 9 when the incident happened and I don't remember much besides the white ribbons on the anniversary and I didn't even know what it was about really except that women were killed in Montreal. I think that people who were kids when this happened or born after it should watch it to know what happened.The movie also begins by showing how tough it was for women engineers in 1989. I'm sure it's still difficult, probably less than it was in 1989, but still difficult nonetheless.The film doesn't try to understand the incident or why the killer murdered 14 women. It's kind of like Gus Van Sant's ""Elephant"" that way (a movie about the Columbine massacre). As long as there's deeply disturbed individuals who aren't getting help and lots of cheap guns and ammunition, incidents like this will persist. Changes have been made since 1989 and despite there being shootings like the one at Dawson college, I think progress has been made.December 6th is officially National Day of Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women in Canada. A white ribbon campaign was started by men in 1991.",Polytechnique

21,ronchow,An excellent Docu-Drama,9,31 May 2011,"From the opening scene of students busy doing their copying in front of an array of copying machines, and the sudden disruption caused by a burst of gun fire, Polytechnique grabs the viewers by the collar and placed them right in the middle of this horrific event that took place in Montreal in 1989.The film claimed to be a fictionalized account of the massacre, in which 14 women were killed and many others were wounded, and I don't know to what extent it adheres to facts. But that does not matter. As far as story telling goes Denis Villeneuves did it with skill and without fanfare. B/W images, and a restraint use of dialogue and music add to the mood of this film, which is not an uplifting experience by its very nature. Acting was good by the several male and female leads. Editing was excellent.Overall, I look at this films as Canadian cinema at its best - despite the depressing nature of the subject matter.",Polytechnique
22,diomavro,Good but too idealized,6,12 November 2015,"I know its supposed to be a true story so the material is bounded as to what it can provoke but nonetheless this is insufficient. It feels like this is trying to give feminists a purpose instead of trying to give humanity to its characters. The shooter is just a misogynist from top to bottom and everyone else is a nice and balanced person. This just isn't good movie material. I will say I enjoyed the way this movie was filmed however, quite stylish with some nice shots in the school especially the rotation around its characters. No offense but anyone who actually thinks that its likely that somebody would tell a female engineer she should re-consider because she is a woman in AN INTERVIEW is downright delusional, especially in Canada where something like this would probably cause a media outrage, a little offhand comment is plausible but somebody expanding to that detail was just nonsense. This is nitpicking but this nonsense kind of pulled me out of the film. The dude who killed himself is only in the movie so we can see him kill himself, such teleological picking doesn't make for a good narrative, at the very least we should have seen some more of his emotional struggles. Its such a shame because this director has talent.",Polytechnique
23,sepial,All the right choices,9,20 May 2014,"The 2nd film by Villeneuve I've so far seen, and he's already one of my favourite film makers. And, judging the reviews, he also divides. Some of the negative reviews complain about the film makers' choice to basing the film on actual events while fictionalizing it on purpose. And I'm a little lost about that, I'm not sure whether it's the choice or in fact this disclaimer that meets this discontent - in other words whether anything would be different had the reviewers in question missed the disclaimer. What is fiction, what reality indeed, to quote one of the other reviewers. As soon as you touch a subject, be it in writing or as a film, you fictionalize it - to a degree it even goes that way with documentaries (and it begins with memories). This makes the choice of the film makers a rather smart one - if you know nothing about the Montreal shooting, actually if you do, but weren't there, the difference is almost incidental. What we're left with is one shooting and its effects for many others. Does this choice make the film unrealistic? Far from it. Unless you consider a, say, McEwan novel as unrealistic and exploiting for being fiction while putting the plot into a context of real events. Whether the choice is made out of respect for the victims is also irrelevant for the viewer. For the viewer contents-format relation is decisive. And what we see is uncommented on matter-of-factly depiction that keeps an unusual balance between the graphic (not in the sense of the usual graphic detail, but rather of graphic impact) and the subtle, the restrained. It says, This is what a shooting is. Full stop. The effect on the survivors is told in equally un-elaborated form. It never fully enters either the victims' nor the perp's total POV beyond this constraint, which is smart again; otherwise it'd be inevitable to cross the border to the sentimental, which I always find insulting towards the victims. Instead we're watching jumps between the significant moments both of the shooting and the later effects on the traumatized, only where necessary, and without distorting embellishment. The film begins with a letter composed by the shooter, which he's about to carry on his person, to be found by the world to read in the aftermath. The film makers do not allow him this fame within the frame of the film. Although the film begins with him, and although he necessarily prominent he is denied the higher significance he seeks on the whole, his end as incidental in comparison; he remains nameless. It ends with another letter, from a survivor to the shooter's parents, beginning with her saying that she knows that this letter will not be read (presumably because it's meant to stay with her). Which is the one that stays with us. This is the closest the writer & director go. And they let it end right there. Perhaps it's not the best way to turn a review into a rebuttal, but these points highlight what I liked about the film. The film makers stood before the same questions as the reviewers, they made a conscious choice, and it was the right one. To me this is one of the most tactful treatments of the subject of shootings, while bringing us right there, and it does so without the burden of artificial sentiment, making the impact an even stronger one.",Polytechnique

The shooter was a misogynist who hated women taking engineering in the same polytechnic school he attended (polytechnic is a mix of university and technical high end community college classes in canada). The movie is not a super accurate historical telling of what happened....its a retelling...the victims remain women but names are different as is the shooter's. We see the story as is as the moment occurs, and the aftermath it had on survivors and how the event changed their thinking towards life. It's very candidly shot intermined with some stellar high end we planned steadicam shots. It's a earlier film by master director denis villeneuve ( prisoners, blade runner 2049, dune (2020)) and it's his second world stage game changer film production. The visuals are very consistent...bright with solid contrast. It most looks like its scanned in 4k. The sound mixing is incredible. The god awful bullet shots take on all speakers at times, the candidacy of the dialogue from injured victims breathe from their throats straight through your speakers. Its an important film that perhaps teaches us how to deal with and confront hate. An important gem of a film that must be disturbing which ironically and thankfully breeds hope as experienced by the main female character from the film...a survivor with life to live onto. Out of print, this should be rereleased with a downscaled from 4k 1080p scan by criterion collection.",Polytechnique
25,dmdebruyn,The Beginnings of a Master,9,29 April 2020,"Since I'm really really looking forward to seeing Dune in the future, I felt like checking out this early film from Denis Villeneuve's filmography. This movie's based on a real-life tragedy that occurred at the Polytechnique Montreal engineering school in 1989, and it dramatizes the event in a way that feels very humanistic. It doesn't make any comments or draw conclusions about the event and still leaves you feeling for most of the people involved. It does a great job of being ambiguous, something Villeneuve has mastered throughout his filmography. My heart goes out to the survivors, and my thanks go out to Villeneuve for being so great at making films like this.",Polytechnique
26,landry22,Please run see this film!,9,3 February 2009,"I cannot say enough how overdue and how perfectly balanced this film is. It will hit you like a ton of brick, and you will not see the world the same ever, and it's a good thing! Polytechnique sucks you in and makes you not the voyeur of a gory violent spectacle, but the helpless witness of your own rape. The script of this film is absolutely brilliant, and the masterful editing takes you on a journey right on the cusp of the abyss but instead of leaving you there, takes you away and lets you make your own mind.To think that the events on which this film is based really happened (I was an engineering student in 1989) is bone-chilling. But to realize, as the film so strongly suggests, that you can survive hell and live to be a strong and beautiful soul, that you can refuse to surrender to the horror some believe to be the only solution to life's contradictions is a lesson we can all learn from.Despite all apprehensions and negative comments we're heard or read since this movie became a project many years ago, this film is first and foremost about hope.",Polytechnique
27,jamesives,Best director out there,10,8 November 2021,Denis has got to be my favourite director so while I was waiting to go to the cinema to see dune I decided to search out for this film. This is the true story about a college shooting In 1989. Denis has a way of making you feel for the characters without knowing much about them and knowing what happens to some characters ( the story is told in the eyes of 3 people ) I gotta say it bought tears to my eyes. Such a tragic story told beautifully and obviously my heart goes out to all the victims and their families. Top marks for one of the greatest directors about.,Polytechnique
28,gravybacon,A Realistic recreation of a real life nightmare.,8,23 February 2020,"This film, shot mostly handheld with a black and white color grade, is a realistic recreation of a real life nightmare scenario that happened not too long ago in modern history. Focusing on a small group of fictional recreations of real life people, this film truly shows the dangers of untreated pyschological disorders, including depression, and the dangers of anti social idealogy in the hands of an armed person. It is a well done film with excellent acting from the cast, and is an anxiety inducing and truly negative experience, but one worth watching, to both remember the horror of the past, and to realize that such events still happen far too frequently in the present.",Polytechnique
29,MrFrankenstein,Awesome cinema - wonderfully disturbing,8,1 November 2009,"Please disregard the quite bizarre ranting of that earlier reviewer talking about 'whitewashes' and 'feminist hate groups' - good grief! Some people's children...Short potted review: a truly stunning film, beautifully photographed (in glowing black and white) dealing - like Van Sant's Elephant, with a school shooting. I have to say I preferred this to 'Elephant' - as it reached depths that Van Sant just couldn't get to.Put aside the Hollywood-inspired urge to have everything neatly tied up and explained - the film treats the complexity of a school shooting with the subtlety it deserves.If you're into thoughtful elegant cinema - you MUST see this. This is the kind of apparently simple-seeming film-making, that America, by and large, has completely forgotten how to do.There wasn't a single wrong note anywhere in either the casting, direction, or script - I was totally entranced. Given the absurd raving of the previous reviewer, I was expecting some kind of sleazy b-movie - and was pleasantly surprised at the very well made piece of cinematic art that I was watching.This is one of those 'keepers' - a rather special film. Yes its intense, and violent at times - but what do you expect - the central plot is about a rampage through a school by an armed psycho who seemed to have some major issues with the female gender. That said, there's a fascinating little subplot, looking at a larger social picture which, in some ways, reflects the same attitude of the psycho killer...Enough said, I don't want to give anything away - if you like mature, thoughtful cinema - this is some astoundingly well-made film.",Polytechnique
30,bexley-3,"Brilliant, Harrowing, Appropriate. A must see.",8,5 October 2009,"A couple of things to note: this film is described as ""fictionalised"", but as far as I know most of it is accurate. The massacre occurred, the film is dedicated to the fourteen women killed (who are named at the end of the movie), and the film makers have changed the names of the characters to spare the families.I avoided this until someone I trusted recommended it. I was concerned that it would be either exploitive or inept, or one of those movies that tries to explain the ""phsychology"" behind insane rampages (yawn) at the expense of the victims.In fact Polytechnique is a sparse simple work of great skill and humanity. There is no gratuitous violence, no gratuitous emotion, no excesses of any kind. Unsentimental, and completely moving.Afterwards I found myself looking up the chronology of the massacre and was surprised at how accurate the film really is.And to address a previous comment, Marc Lepin was not a victim of a feminist conspiracy. Marc Lepin was the victim of Marc Lepine. Too bad he took fourteen others with him.",Polytechnique
31,soah-2,Brilliant piece of work,8,3 November 2009,"I thought that this film really portrayed the story very well. If you have ever had to endure a Montreal winter, even for a few days, it was captured so beautifully. The lack of dialogue drove you to rely on your other senses. This film really made you think that this could actually happen here in Canada! I think all of the negative comments are just from some of our friends in the south who have been through many school shootings and are desensitized to it. You must member, 20 years ago, there was nothing like this happening anywhere in North America! let alone a higher education institution!The 20th anniversary is coming up, and I will be wearing a white ribbon. I know the man who runs this program and will be donating as well. Violence against women is still a very live reality in this world, and we should do everything we can to educate against it. Seeing this film is a great start for anyone.",Polytechnique
32,couturegabriel,A powerful and meditative film that is both horrific and poetic.,10,9 February 2009,"I hadn't planned on seeing this film but was invited by a friend. Thank yous came out of my mouth the moment we stepped out of the theater; the only words which managed to escape my rattled mind.This is a film which I believe is a must see. Brutal and raw, it breaks a real story into a few basic elements and lets the events speak for themselves. The film depicts the sad events of this day in 1989 with such realism that the viewer feels himself part of the drama, a witness to the violence. Filmed in black and white, and with very similar stylistic elements to Gus Van Sant's Elephant, few words are needed for the director to properly convey the desired range of emotions which take place in the movie.I must add that there were shots of such beauty which contrasted the ugliness of the shooting in such a moving way that while trying to old back tears at one point, I thought to myself ""Life is a wonderful gift.."" I have never written a review for this site before, and enjoy a great variety of films: I walked out of the silent, full theater, packed with viewers just as shell shocked as I, thinking that this might have been the most gut wrenching movie experience of my life.Do see",Polytechnique
