0,TheLittleSongbird,The not so great and powerful Oz,5,26 March 2013,"I love anything to do with The Wizard of Oz. The story is a classic, and the 1939 Judy Garland film is for me one of the best films ever made. And I liked the idea of having a prequel to this story, and Oz the Great and Powerful had potential to be great in the right hands. I was kind of intrepid though as well because I heard a lot of bad things about it, and while it was not as bad as I'd heard it was a disappointment. And this was including me taking into account that it is a family movie and that any film should be judged on its own merits.Oz the Great and Powerful does have a fair few things that redeem it. I loved the visuals, I thought on seeing the trailer that they looked amazing and on seeing the film itself I still stand by that. The colours are truly beautiful to look at and the cinematography and camera angles don't intrude too much and allow us to properly enjoy the visuals. The costumes and sets equally fanciful, Michelle Williams in particular looks radiant, while the CGI effects have moments where they are generic, but on the most part they're fine. Danny Elfman's score doesn't have the whimsical, poignant magic that his Edward Scissorhands score has for example, but it is both sparkling and rousing and you really feel a sense of fantasy and adventure when hearing it. When it comes to individual scenes, the highlight was the expertly done and thrilling tornado sequence, it looked great and didn't feel dragged out too long. And there are two performances that are good. Coming off the best was Rachel Weisz who is deliciously sassy and seductive. Michelle Williams occasionally comes across as a little too airy-fairy, but she also makes a good impression, being wondrous visually and being full of charm and benevolence.James Franco and Mila Kunis did absolutely nothing for me though. Franco I've liked before in other films, the finest example being 127 Hours, but I did feel that in perhaps an attempt to be quirky that he wildly overdid his part, his smirking- almost like he was stoned- grated really fast. Kunis unfortunately is bland personified, granted she was not given much worthwhile to work with but I just could not buy her at all as a Wicked Witch and there is no expression at all in her eyes. The voice acting is serviceable but never much more than that. Franco and Kunis are not the only let downs to the film. The script, story and pacing were really big issues in this regard. The script tries to incorporate too many things all at once and instead of doing this successfully it comes across as muddled and stilted instead. The story starts off well, but quickly becomes contrived, paper-thin and rushed with next to none of the enchantment, sense of wonder and emotional resonance that the story and 1939 film have. Relationships are introduced quickly and end even quicker than that. The overall pacing was rushed, but the lack of any genuine excitement also eventually made the film a sludge as it tries to stretch a very thin plot longer than it needed to be. The characters also are ones that we never learn anything about and consequently I didn't properly care for a single one.All in all, has its good points and things to enjoy but this Oz is not as great or as powerful as it had potential to be. Not bad, but disappointing all the same. 5/10 Bethany Cox",Oz the Great and Powerful
1,Leofwine_draca,Enjoyable attempt to recapture old glory,6,29 December 2015,"That the original WIZARD OF OZ is a classic is pretty much a given, I think. It's hard to dislike a film that's so full of memorable scenes and characters, and Sam Raimi is the guy behind this prequel that attempts to show us a few back stories about some of the characters in the 1930s film. It's a mixed bag as a film overall, but it does recapture some of the old Raimi magic, and overall it's a film that's hard to dislike.Certainly in a world of lacklustre ALICE IN WONDERLAND and CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY adaptations, OZ THE GREAT AND POWERFUL really stands out. The transition from black and white to full colour is a glorious one and the enhanced colour palette of the film really works. The whole journey is a visual treat, with excellent CGI backdrops and the like that really bring Oz to life in a way that in some cases is even more breath-taking than in WIZARD.The central characters and their storyline are a little weaker, but still more than watchable. I'm a bit ambivalent when it comes to James Franco but I can appreciate that he does a good and thorough job here as the roguish magician thrown into a decidedly unnatural adventure. His companions in Oz are very well animated and brimming with character. Sadly, the witch storyline isn't so good; Michelle Williams is surprisingly effective, but Mila Kunis is miscast and Rachel Weisz is just poor. Nonetheless, although OZ THE GREAT AND POWERFUL has its detractors, I think it's a lot of simple, old-fashioned fun.",Oz the Great and Powerful
2,SnoopyStyle,Suffers from the Comparison but Good on its own terms,7,16 January 2014,"This is the imagined prequel to 'The Wizard of Oz'. It's 1905 Kansas. Oscar (James Franco) is a carnival magician. After barely escaping from the strong man in a hot air balloon, he gets swept up in a tornado and lands in the Land of Oz. There he follows the witch Theodora (Mila Kunis) into the Emerald City to see her sister Evanora (Rachel Weisz). They tell him that he is the prophetized Wizard who is destined to rid Oz of the evil witch Glinda (Michelle Williams).It's an interesting take on the world of Oz. It tries to weave a viable prequel to the iconic movie. For the most part, the story achieves a workable world where the wizard, the witches, and the characters are all so familiar. But there are problems. The biggest problem is the problem of comparison. This is always the danger. The original is the Hollywood gold standard. It is legendary. It is magical. Any new movie could never truly measure up and this doesn't. It doesn't have the magic nor any songs. It's trying build a movie without the heart of the classic but this must be considered on its own terms.The technicals look good. Director Sam Raimi has the skills. For so much CGI, the movie could easily look fake. It's obviously CG but it looks good. I especially love the character of China Girl. She's especially cute and funny. The acting is not so great. James Franco plays the morally questionable wizard well. The ladies don't do as well. Michelle Williams is all one note as Glinda the Good Witch. She tries to inhabit the iconic role so much that there is no nuance. The only good point in her performance is actually when Glinda tells Oscar that she knows he's not what she expected. Rachel Weisz does a passable job. Mila Kunis couldn't make the transition. She's OK as a sweet naive girl, but her evil persona just doesn't have the juice. Overall, it is a good movie as long as you don't try to compare to the original.",Oz the Great and Powerful
3,Prismark10,Oz before Dorothy,6,10 December 2013,"The film starts in a small screen black and white. It is 1905 Kansas and Oscar Diggs is a flaky magician in a circus.As a storm approaches with a strongman chasing him for flirting with his wife, he escapes in a hot air balloon but the tornado takes him to the Land of Oz where things get a bit Technicolor.Oscar encounters the beautiful yet naive witch Theodora, who believes him to be a wizard sent to destroy the Wicked Witch who killed the King of Oz.However Theodora's sister is the duplicitous Evanora and Glinda the 'wicked' witch may not be all she is supposed to be.Rachel Weisz is having a hoot as Evanora and evil her plotting. Mila Kunis with her ample cleavage is enough to mask any deficiencies in her acting.However, James Franco is caught short with his Oz. He merely seems to be going through the film with the same nervy grin. He lacks any showman qualities that you expect from the Wizard of Oz instead he comes across as a low life sleaze bag.It's obvious Franco comes across as the guy who was 15th in in line in the casting list with Johnny Depp and Robert Downey Jr having turned down the role. The film works despite him not because of him.",Oz the Great and Powerful
4,mark.waltz,"Has ""the look"" but is missing ""the charm"".",5,23 May 2016,"Don't look for ""Wicked"" in this prequel to the 1939 classic, loosely based upon other L. Frank Baum stories. This stars James Franco as the future wizard of Oz who manages to break away from a black and white/non- widescreen Kansas tornado and fly into the colorful but often sinister land of Oz where he meets three beautiful women of various stages of morality and goodness. Then, there's a cute winged monkey, a seemingly sweet (but annoying) china doll and other familiar looking old friends from the original ""The Wizard of Oz"".Two sisters (Mila Kunis and Rachel Weisz) are running the Emerald City when the king of humbug arrives, and it is obvious that they are the future demonic rulers of the west and east. Who is who is not obvious, although the presence of Glinda is clear, if not as glamorous in Michelle Williams' hands as it was in Billie Burke's. Far more sinister to meet modern experience expectations, that is to the film's detriment. Obviously rushed out to capitalize on the success of Broadway's ""Wicked"", it makes that slightly over- rated musical seem a classic. This gets often overly silly and frequently mean-spirited, something that the charm of the original managed to avoid thanks to its innocence. The character of Theodora, the name given to the witch of the West, is simply turned into a vindictive crone, consumed with revenge over unrequited love towards the wizard. By adding a romantic attachment with two of the witches goes against the grain of the original story. The witch of the west seems to cackle out of nowhere, even when loosing her cause, and isn't at all as fascinating as Margaret Hamilton's witch or Elphaba of ""Wicked"" fame. Getting to know the witch of the east is a little more interesting, especially for those who have not seen ""Wicked"", although no reference is given to how she ended up ruling Munchkin City. References are hinted at that the Wizard knew Dorothy Gale's parents, but nothing is further explored in that realm. Certainly, 1939's MGM classic became famous slowly over time (thanks to TV), but that most likely will not happen with this film.",Oz the Great and Powerful
5,claudio_carvalho,Entertaining and Beautiful,7,23 June 2013,"In 1905, in Kansas, the small-time circus magician Oscar ""Oz"" Diggs (James Franco) is a weak, greedy, selfish and womanizer conman without character. He gives music box to the women that he seduces, and when a strong artist finds that his wife has a box in her belongings, he chases Oz through the circus. Oz flees in a balloon, but a tornado strikes his balloon and he lands on the Land of Oz.Oscar meets the gorgeous Theodora (Mila Kunis) and she believes that he is the powerful magician from an ancient prophecy that will release her land from the Wicked Witch. Theodora tells that her sister and she are good witches, but the Wicked Witch had killed the king. Now the people are waiting for the magician to be their new king after defeating the witch. Theodora is seduced by Oz and brings him to the City of Emerald. When he sees the king's treasure, he decides to seek out the Wicked Witch and destroy her magic wand to get rid off her and become the king. Oz meets Glinda (Michelle Williams), who is supposed to be the Wicked witch, and soon he learns that Theodora's sister Evanora (Rachel Weisz) is the evil one indeed. Meanwhile Evanora lures he sister that is jealous and uses a spell to turn her into a wicked witch. Oscar learns that he is the only hope for the inhabitants of Oz that believe that he is a powerful magician and his only chance to defeat Evanora and Theodora is using illusion since he has no magic power.""Oz the Great and Powerful"" is an entertaining fantasy movie, with beautiful special effects and great cast. The beginning in black and white turns to bright colors when Oz reaches the magic kingdom and the images are wonderful. It takes too long for the unethical lead character to redeem and become a good man. For viewers that enjoy fantasy movies, ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" is a highly recommended movie. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Oz: Mágico e Poderoso"" (""Oz: Magic and Powerful"")",Oz the Great and Powerful
6,nogodnomasters,IF THIS WAS EASY WE WOULDN'T NEED A WIZARD,10,26 May 2019,"This is a worthy prequel to the ""Wizard of Oz."" As of now there has yet to have been a film worthy to its sequel or prequel. The production starts out in black and white as the original film and switches to color. Aspects of Kansas are carried over into Oz so pay attention. The film has some early twists, which you may already know if you read any review, but it is nothing complicated.James Franco stars in the title role. He reminded me of Edward Norton in ""The Illusionist."" Oz is a phoney and a bit of a womanizer. His magic consists of flash powder, glue, and determination.The best was Mila Kunis. She owned Theodora. Clearly a People's Choice Award. Her performance alone was worth the price of admission. The movie meshes neatly into the film we all know and love. Rachel Weisz shined in her performance as well. The on screen chemistry between Franco and Michelle Williams could improve.The flying baboons are far more fierce and scary than the flying monkeys in the original. Indeed, if your child has trouble with nightmares from horror films, you might think twice of taking them, but go yourself. Better than the ""Snow White and the Huntsman.""",Oz the Great and Powerful
7,kosmasp,Before the Rainbow,7,20 August 2013,"Prequels or reboots are the new trend these days. And while this is a prequel to one of the most beloved films (Sam Raimi couldn't do differently I guess, so from Spider Man to Oz he went), it does kind of work. Maybe time will tell, if the movie has been received too harshly (some deem it a ""kids"" movie, in a not good fashion aka ""Pixar"" kids movies) or if it made too much money (they already green-lit a sequel (which still would be a prequel to the original, technically).So this movie deals with the ""how did we get here"" part. Which would suggest, that Dorothy actually went there. Then again, there is also a scene which is reminiscent of the duality of the original. So it is in the eye of the beholder after all. But could this happen twice? (or thrice as is very likely now)",Oz the Great and Powerful
8,classicsoncall,"""Let's go make some magic.""",7,17 March 2013,"""Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain"" might be good advice in this case. Virtually every review I've read on this board gives James Franco a negative for his handling of the title character, and I'm not about to dispute that. Not that he's bad, but his portrayal is just not memorable to me. Not in the way Frank Morgan remains etched in memory as the original Professor Marvel. I bet you don't even remember the actor's name from ""The Wizard of Oz"", but you can picture him even if you saw the movie decades ago. You don't have that here. In fact, when you had that gigantic close-up of Franco's face in the cloud effect during the showdown with Evanora (Rachel Weisz), all I could think of was Seinfeld.That's not to say that the movie didn't have it's pluses. I enjoyed the gorgeous use of color even if much of it was computer generated. The China Girl evoked a surprisingly emotional reaction I wouldn't have expected, but the fact that she came from China Town left me rather baffled. Actually, the CGI generated characters seemed more believable to me than the real actors; certainly Finley's monkey face was a lot more expressive than any of the humans he had to work with.I guess what bothered me about the picture that others have expressed more eloquently is that the story just has a randomness to it that carries from one scene to the next without much continuity. When the lion appeared to threaten Finley, it came and went in a flash and left no time to build any kind of suspense. With a number of events occurring so spontaneously, I didn't sense the requisite story development in place to keep me invested for the entire two hour run of the film. The dialog also seemed somewhat amateurish for such a fantastical place as The Emerald City - ""The only person you can't fool is yourself"". How many times have you heard that theme? I don't know, I was expecting more here I guess. Young viewers will probably enjoy this flick, but for me that's all it was, a flick. Best to click your ruby red slippers together and head back to 1939's real deal.",Oz the Great and Powerful
9,jboothmillard,Oz the Great and Powerful,5,8 July 2017,"The Wizard of Oz, based on the novels by L. Frank Baum, is arguably the most popular musical fantasy film of all time, remakes and sequels have followed, with mixed results, this was probably the first prequel, set twenty years before events of the original novel, from director Sam Raimi (The Evil Dead, Spider-Man). Basically in 1905 Kansas, Oscar ""Oz"" Diggs (James Franco) is a small-time magician with a travelling circus, he has been flirting with the wife of the Strongman (Tim Holmes), a storm approaches and the strongman threatens Oscar, he escapes in a hot air balloon, but he is sucked into a tornado that takes him to the Land of Oz. There Oz meets beautiful yet naïve witch Theodora (Mila Kunis), she believes he is the wizard prophesied to become King of Oz by destroying the Wicked Witch who killed the king, Oscar only accepts hearing of the great riches the ruler of Oz will receive. On the journey to the Emerald City, Theodora falls in love with Oscar, but he does not reciprocate her feelings, after saving his life from a lion, they are joined by flying monkey Finley (Zach Braff), who pledges a life debt to Oscar, he reveals his deception to Finley, but the lie that he is a wizard is maintained. At the Emerald City, Oscar meets Theodora's beautiful older sister Evanora (Rachel Weisz), she tells him the Wicked Witch resides in the Dark Forest, she can be destroyed with her own wand, Oscar and Finley travel to find and kill her, and are joined by a young living China Girl (White House Down's Joey King), whose family and home was destroyed by the Wicked Witch. The three reach the Dark Forest, and encounter the ""Wicked Witch"", the beautiful Glinda (Michelle Williams), who identifies herself as the daughter of the late king, in fact Evanora is the true Wicked Witch. Evanora watches the three in the forest through her crystal ball, she tricks Theodora into thinking Oz has deceived her about any feelings he may have had, Evanora offers Theodora a magic apple she says will help remove her heartache, in fact after biting it, Theodora is transformed into the green-skinned, ugly Wicked Witch of the West. Oscar and his group are brought by Glinda to her domain, away from Evanora's army of Winkies and flying baboons, she admits that she knows Oscar is not a wizard, but she still believes he can defeat Evanora, he reluctantly agrees to lead an army of Quadlings, Tinkers and Munchkins. Theodora enters and reveals her hideous appearance, she threatens to kill Oscar and the people, Oscar despairs that there can be no victory, but then talking about his hero Thomas Edison, he conceives a plan of trickery, Glina and his group make preparations. The witches are tricked into sending out the flying baboons, with scarecrow puppets and thick fog, into the poppy field that puts them to sleep, however two baboons manage to capture Glinda, she is brought into the Emerald City and chained. Meanwhile Oscar infiltrates the Emerald City, but he appears to abandon his allies, flying away in a hot balloon filled with gold, which Theodora destroys with a fireball. The witches prepare to execute Glinda before the large crowd of citizens, but then Oscar appears, using a hidden smoke machine and an image projector, he presents a giant image of his face as his ""true"" form, the wicked sisters are intimidated by the blasts of fire, and a fireworks display. Unable to hurt the ""invincible"" wizard, Evanora fearfully hides in the castle, while Theodora flees on her broom, Oscar calls to her and offers her to return should she overcome her wickedness, she angrily refuses and flies away. China Girl releases Gilda, who engages with Evanora in a magical duel, during which Glinda destroys emerald necklace that hides her true, withered appearance, and banishes her, the two remaining baboons carry Evanora away. Oscar is officially established as ruler of Oz, he uses the projector to sustain the belief he is powerful wizard, his friends agree to keep this secret, and he presents them with gifts, finally Oscar takes Glinda behind the curtain to thank her for making him a better person, and they kiss. Also starring Abigail Spencer as May the magic assistant, Bill Cobbs as Master Tinker, Tony Cox as Knuck the grumpy Munchkin herald, Bruce Campbell as Winkie Gate Keeper and Ted Raimi as Skeptic in Audience. Franco is engaging and likable as the con magician turned hero, and Kunis and Weisz really lap up being the beautiful and evil witches, most of the original 1939 movie contents are brought in, from a monochrome opening to the Yellow Brick Road, but no Dorothy or her friends, the brightly coloured scenery and special effects are a real treat for the eye, it is maybe not as magical or emotionally engaging as the classic it pays tribute to, but you can escape with the vibrant fairytale and wonderful characters, a fun family fantasy adventure. Worth watching!",Oz the Great and Powerful
10,Tweekums,An enjoyable origins story,7,2 September 2017,"This prequel to 'The Wizard of Oz' opens in Kansas where circus magician Oscar Diggs, the self-styled 'Oz the Great and Powerful' performs to audiences who want to believe that he really can work miracles which of course he can't. One day he is forced to flee in a balloon; as he flies away he is caught up in a tornado. When he lands he is no longer in the monochrome Kansas but in the vividly coloured land of Oz. He soon meets Theodora, a beautiful and kindly witch who believes that he is the answer to their prophecies; a wizard who shares his name with their land who will defeat the wicked witch who murdered the king. We are told that there are three witches, all sisters and daughters of the king; Theodora, her good sister Evanora and the wicked third sister. On the way to the Emerald city to meet Evanora they save Finley, a winged monkey who joins them.Once there Oz learns that if he is to fulfil the prophecy and thus become king and gain a room full of gold he must go to the Dark Forest and destroy the Wicked Witch's wand. He and Finlay head towards the forest and rescue a Chine Doll whose family were killed by the Wicked Witch. When they finally meet the witch it becomes apparent that not everything we have been told is true; this witch is Glinda and she is far from evil. Evanora is the wicked one. If she is to be defeated, and the Kingdom of Oz saved, Oscar will have to work with the peaceful people of Oz and use many of the tricks he learnt.As an origins story this is rather fun; 'The Wizard of Oz' told us that the wizard was from Kansas and this nicely showed us how he came to Oz and came to such a prominent position. This aspect of the story was interesting but even more interesting was the origin of the Wicked Witch of the West. I like the fact that she wasn't always evil but became evil due to certain events. There are plenty of enjoyable nods to other events in the original film and some nice twists I loved how when we first see the Munchkins it looks as though they are about eight feet tall before it is revealed that each of them is three standing on each other's' shoulders! The cast does a solid job; James Franco is good as the somewhat cowardly wizard and Michelle Williams is likable as Glinda however for me it is Mila Kunis who stands out most as Theodora thanks to the way she went from being a good character to being the cackling evil Wicked Witch of the West. The rest of the cast are pretty good too. The special effects are a bit mixed; I really liked the China Doll character; I didn't mind the vivid, unreal look of Oz but the flying effects often looked rather poor at times; perhaps they worked when the film was shown in 3D but on DVD they looked distinctly ropey. That did detract from the film at times but not enough to spoil it. There are a few good scares; nothing too strong for most children though. Overall I rather enjoyed this despite certain flaws.",Oz the Great and Powerful
11,ma-cortes,An ambitious illusionist/con magician employed by a midwestern traveling circus is transported on the land of Oz .,6,7 January 2014,"The film opens in sepia-tone academy ratio for the Kansas scenes, before widening out and blooming into full color in Oz (however, even the Kansas scenes are 3-D) . There appears Oscar Diggs (James Franco , though Robert Downey Jr. and Johnny Depp were both offered the role ; to prepare for his role Franco received training with magician Lance Burton), a small-time circus magician with dubious ethics . At the start of the film, Oz works with the circus company ""Baum Brothers Circus"" (this is a reference to L. Frank Baum, the original author of the Oz series) . He is hurled away from dusty Kansas to the vibrant Land of Oz. At first he thinks he's hit the jackpot-fame and fortune are his for the taking. That all changes, however, when he meets three witches, Theodora (Mila Kunis), Evanora (Rachel Weisz), and Glinda (Michelle Williams , though Blake Lively was offered the role), who are not convinced he is the great wizard everyone's been expecting. Reluctantly drawn into the epic problems facing the Land of Oz and its inhabitants, Oscar must find out who is good and who is evil before it is too late. Putting his magical arts to use through illusion, ingenuity-and even a bit of wizardry-Oscar transforms himself not only into the great and powerful Wizard of Oz but into a better man as well . Later on , the wiz is forced into a power struggle between three witches .This is an agreeable film for children of all ages based on the all-time classic by Frank Baum . This engrossing picture contains powerful and haunting images , though also contains some flaws and results to be overlong . Beautiful scenery, colorful characters , spirited adventure and a stirring climax lift this story . It is a genuine as well as imaginative tale written and directed with great sensibility , fairness and imagination. It's plenty of scenes that stay in the mind as when the magician appears at the 'other side' that results to be the fantastic as well as glowing world of OZ . There's something for everyone here ; fans of fantasy , fans of magic and necromancy , fans of incredible adventures , should all find something to enjoy about this film . A perfect cast and enjoyable secondaries in the perfect fantasy . As a likable acting by James Franco as a small-time Kansas magician who is swept away to an enchanted land .

Spectacular and glamorous sets , production designer Robert Stromberg studied the films of Frank Capra and Walt Disney classic films to achieve the appropriate Art Deco design for the Emerald City of Oz . The director opted to use practical sets in conjunction with computer-generated imagery : physical sets were constructed so the actors could have a visual reference, as opposed to using green-screens for every scene . Director Sam Raimi and composer Danny Elfman had a major falling out during the post-production of Spider-Man 2 (2004), with Elfman stating that they would never work together again. With this film, they were able to patch things up and reconcile .This story about OZ has been adapted several times such as : An old and mute version (1925) , the classic and the best rendition , the MGM release ¨The wizard of Oz¨ (1939) by Victor Fleming with Judy Garland , Ray Bolger , Billy Burke , Jack Haley , Frank Morgan and Margaret Hamilton as witch ; remade in 1978 as ¨The Wiz¨ by Sidney Lumet with Diana Ross , Richard Pryor and Michael Jackson and ¨Return to Oz¨ (1985) by Walter Murch with Fauriza Falk ,Nicol Willliamson, Matt Clark and Piper Laurie .",Oz the Great and Powerful
12,BA_Harrison,Oz the Unexceptional.,6,23 March 2019,"I've been a fan of The Wizard of Oz since I was a child, and Sam Raimi has directed a handful of my favourite films, so this melding of the two-a prequel to the 1939 classic-was always going to be intriguing. But while I cannot say I wasn't entertained, I was definitely disappointed: Raimi relies far too heavily on unconvincing CGI to bring the colourful world of Oz to life, and much of the time I found it too easy to picture its star, James Franco, acting alone against a green screen.However, the unrealistic surroundings and creatures are not the film's only problems: there's a bad case of 3D-itis, Raimi wasting no opportunity to thrust objects or people into the foreground, so-much-so that it proves distracting; Franco is horribly miscast as The Wizard, unable to make his character likeable (I'm guessing he was aiming for 'lovable rogue'; he misses); and the script is rather bland and predictable.Having said that, there's enough of Raimi's signature manic directorial style to keep fans engaged, with a few scenes guaranteed to scare the kiddies (that flying baboon jumping out of the mist almost got me), whilst the inclusion of a trio of hot witches was always guaranteed to keep my attention: Michelle Williams as Glinda, Mila Kunis as Theodora, and Rachel Weisz as Evanora, all three of whom wear outfits that accentuate their cleavage (sooo much boobage for a Disney movie!).At the end of the day, this is no match for Judy Garland and pals (or The Evil Dead), and is unlikely to become a perennial favourite, but it's a passable way to spend a couple of hours.5.5/10, rounded up to 6 for IMDb.",Oz the Great and Powerful
13,moonspinner55,All the technical wizardry in Hollywood still cannot turn James Franco into a convincing showman...,6,8 March 2013,"In Depression-era Kansas, a second-rate carnival magician--also a con-artist and a cad with the ladies--is whisked away from home in a balloon by a tornado and finds himself in a magical land called Oz (which is also the magician's nickname!), wherein the good people of the city are under the thumb of a wicked tyrant. Opening ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" with a marvelous black-and-white prologue filmed in the 1.33:1 aspect ratio, director Sam Raimi gets this fantasy-adventure off to a dazzling start (the opening credits sequence, itself preceded by a beautiful Disney logo, is also magical). However, once we are introduced to James Franco's magician, and quickly perceive that he is selfish and greedy (and narcissistic, though that may be only how Franco is playing him), there's nothing much to concentrate on except the CG effects (which are visually uneven). The tepid screenplay, by Mitchell Kapner and David Lindsay-Abaire, needed the kind of loving care which has been lavished upon the art direction, what with characters that don't make sense and character conflicts which are perplexing rather than involving. The two sisters currently running the Emerald City, Theodora (Mila Kunis) and Evanora (Rachel Weisz), don't appear to know much about each other or what the other is capable of, and their future alliance seems connected to the rest of the picture by happenstance. The phony wizard himself arrives in Oz in a preconceived way, while the constant cutting to close-ups of Franco's inexpressive face takes away from the awe Raimi surely wants the audience to feel at this point. Raimi's participation is odd, certainly, but his casting as director is not as disastrous as Franco's half-hearted fling in the leading role. Smiling too broadly (while no doubt being instructed to act raffish and adorable), Franco is both too modern for this part and too self-enamored. There's no connection between Franco, the man he's playing, the fanciful scenario (which needed a lighter touch with sprightlier pacing), nor the other cast members; he could be acting in front of a mirror. There's an honest and affectionate attempt to recapture the magic of 1939's ""The Wizard of Oz"", albeit with corny, leadweight tries at humor (again, too modern), yet only Kunis (in her beautiful green makeup) is able to get this material soaring to those same heights. The film doesn't blossom; it is laid out for us in a perfunctory fashion, despite the two thrill-ride overtures which seem interjected mainly to give the movie some lift (the bubble-floating entrance with Glinda to Munchkinland begins well, but the business with the security wall doesn't end up making a lot of sense). Too many ideas are thrown at the screen without benefit of logic, such as a ferocious lion who comes out of nowhere (and disappears just as fast) or a winged monkey (dressed like a bellhop) who is seen dragging the wizard's luggage on the ground one minute and flying with it effortlessly the next. Perhaps nimbler editing could have done away with the dross (the withering stabs at easy laughs, the awkward setting up of the tent-show actress at the beginning), but Franco is a casualty the movie must unfortunately contend with from start to finish. His artificial theatricality as Oz is so forced (and without heart) that he comes off as contemptuous of these make-believe surroundings. If the actor on-screen doesn't believe in what he's doing, how can the audience? **1/2 from ****",Oz the Great and Powerful
14,tavm,Oz the Great and Powerful was a wonderful spectacle of marvel,8,17 March 2013,"Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend along with one of his sisters and her husband. We all were quite enthralled by the spectacle of all that transpired during the course of the film. James Franco does a nice mix of the doubt and eventual confidence in the title role. Mila Kunis and Rachel Weisz are fine as the sister witches and Michelle Williams likewise as Glinda, the good one. Like the classic 1939 musical version, this film begins in black-and-white before going to color when we reach Oz. Oh, and that beginning sequence is also on a smaller ratio than the rest of the movie. There might be some flaws here and there but, overall, I highly enjoyed Oz the Great and Powerful.",Oz the Great and Powerful
15,edwagreen,Oz-Varied Retelling ***,7,16 November 2013,"The L. Frank Baum classic is retold with perhaps mild success in this 2013 film.James Franco gave a completely lackluster performance as the con artist magician who is transported back to the magical land and is confronted by the fact that there are witches about ready to wreak havoc on the populace there.I kept wondering why Mila Kunis was not the evil witch since she appears so nice and friendly. Her sister, played well by Rachel Weisz, keeps telling her that Glynda, Michelle Williams, is the bad witch and when she thinks that the Wizard (Franco) is falling for Glynda, she turns completely evil and makes her sister look rather benign in comparison.Gone in this version is Dorothy, instead replaced by a cartoon-like girl. There is a monkey and some town people along the way with the Munchkins and others alike.Perhaps, we were used to the wonderful music of the 1939 classic.",Oz the Great and Powerful
16,Scarecrow-88,Oz the Great and Powerful,7,29 July 2013,"A self-absorbed magician, Oz (James Franco, with a smile of teeth, seemingly jolly even when in danger), in a traveling carnival escapes from a vengeance-seeking strongman in a hot air balloon and is swept into a tornado that cascades him into a magical land called Oz. Once there, he meets ""Theodora the Good"" (Mila Kunis), an emotionally vulnerable witch who believes he's the new king foretold in prophesy to sit upon the throne of the Emerald City. But Theodora's evil sister, Evanora (Rachel Weisz) wishes to retain her powerful grip on Emerald City (she is equipped with an army of winged monstrous primates with sharp teeth and a mean streak), eventually convincing Oz that if he wants to be king he must destroy the wand of ""the wicked witch of the Dark Forest"" (actually a good witch, Wanda, played by the lovely, cherubic Michelle Williams). Instead, Evanora sees an opening to lead Theodora to the dark side, convincing her that Oz never felt anything for her, causing her to bite from a poisoned apple. Theodora becomes the Wicked Witch of the West, and the two wicked sisters will turn their sights on tearing apart all that oppose them. With elaborate effects creating a magical world of blooming flowers, a dark forest with ominous eyes and seemingly hostile branches from eerie trees, ""traveling bubbles"" (that carry our heroes through the sky, away from Evanora's flying minions), the glistening green of Emerald City, the lifelike winged monkey companion of Oz named Finley (voiced by Zach Braff who is Oz's assistant in the B&W introductory sequence prior to the trip to the land of Oz) and ceramic doll named China (Joey King), whose broken legs were mended with glue by Oz, and the iconic Yellow Brick Road that leads our heroes on their journeys. That said, while Disney brings out all these effects (including make-up effects for Kunis later when revealed as the green Wicked Witch in black hat) money can buy, it doesn't quite equal the universal appeal of The Wizard of Oz, although the heart seems to be in the right place as well as the budget. Sam Raimi and his enormous budget didn't have Judy Garland, even though Disney pulls out all the stops. There's lots of ""witch duels"" with bolts cast from wands, and Oz uses magic tricks to convince Theodora and Evanora that he indeed has powers (when Theodora sends a blast that lights up a hot air balloon supposedly carrying Oz, he uses this belief in his demise as a weapon against the wicked witches), his face captured in a large cloud of smoke (including a fireworks display that convinces Theodora she's got a worthy rival). My kids love this movie, so it does capture the imagination of children; that accounts for something with this father. So bonus points for entertaining the intended audience. For us, the adults, I think we might can admire the visual beauty of the artists who created Oz based on The Wizard of Oz, but the story involved doesn't really attempt to surpass the origins of its inspiration. This all stays close to the vest with little attempt for fresh material. Sadly, the cast really never creates magic in their parts; that was a major reason for the remaining appeal of The Wizard of Oz. Kunis, to me, never matches the monstrous, skin-crawling power of her predecessor, Margaret Hamilton; she tries hard, though, but I think it is a case of miscasting. Also, for some reason, I felt Weisz was out of place, too. Franco's all smiles, and there's a carefree nature to his performance as Oz. I guess he was likable enough. All the parts, it wasn't for a lack of trying...I always felt they gave their best, but perhaps the characters just never fit them. When all is said and done, I consider this an effects movie first, with the characters and story less important to Disney and Raimi; perhaps, this will be considered a miscalculation on their part.",Oz the Great and Powerful
17,preppy-3,Oz the Mediocre and Boring,3,31 March 2013,"Bad prequel to ""The Wizard of Oz"". It starts in 1905 with James Franco (SERIOUSLY miscast) playing a con man/magician who works at a broken down carnival. Through circumstances too silly to relate he gets whisked away to the land of Oz. There he finds three sisters who over see everything--Theodora (Mila Kunis), Evanora (Rachel Weisz) and Glinda (Michelle Williams). They're waiting for a wizard to come help them defeat a wicked witch. They also throw in a ""comic"" flying monkey and a little doll made of china--that walks and talks of course.It starts off on a small screen and in b&w and (when it hits Oz) the screen opens up WIDE and color kicks in. It LOOKS great--the color are hyper bright and the special effects are great--but that's about it. The story is slow, long and boring. There are plenty of gaps in logic, the comedy is dreadful and if contains those ""cute"" little ""life lessons"" that pop up in every Disney film. These messages are so heavy-handed even kids will probably find them obvious and stupid. Also, due to copyright issues, Disney had to change things in the movie. There are no ruby slippers and the scary flying monkeys from the original are now stupid-looking flying baboons. Acting doesn't help. Franco tries to be charming and sweet but comes across as obnoxious and stupid. Williams has nothing to work with, Weisz (unwisely) underplays her role and Kunis is a blank. I was bored out of my mind and couldn't wait for the movie to end. Kids might like it but I hated it. A 3.",Oz the Great and Powerful

All of the Style is in the CGI. It has a Certain Eye Candy Appeal that also Lacks Warmth, Depth, and Anything Resembling a Soul.But here it is. A Mega-Million Dollar Spewing of the Plasticized, Industrial Art that has become the Standard for This Type of Thing. The Other Worldliness of the Superhero and other Fantasies. It can Work Very Well in Limited Quantities but when that's All there is, that's All there is.

He Grins and Smirks and All the Women On Screen, and in the Audience, are Supposed to be Charmed Out of Their Pants. Right.The Prequel has its Moments of Appeal, but Hardly Awe Inspiring. The Witches are Interchangeable Bores. The Flying Monkey is OK and the China Doll is the Most Memorable. There are a lot of Explosions and Fireballs to Pump the Sub-Woofers and Danny Elfman's Recognizable Style is Noticeable from the First Few Notes (did someone say repetition). Overall, the Movie can be Recommended in a Gaudy kind of Display with Enough Color to Capture the Eye, but the Movie is Not that Captivating. It is such a Mediocre Movie that Slightly Betrays the Source Material and is Another Expensive Extravaganza that is by Most Accounts Disappointing and Adequate at Best.

With some nice nods to the original ""Wizard of Oz"" by filmmaker Sam Raimi having a field day with the special effects wizards the film lacks the warmth and characters to actually root for (among the new are a porcelain doll and a flying monkey, both a tad grating and winy) and Franco's turn is a tad too callow and smarmy instead of blustery and confident.

20,neil-476,Disappointing,7,15 March 2013,"Small-time carnival hustler and magician Oscar aka ""Oz"" (James Franco) finds himself whisked away, via balloon and tornado, to the land of Oz, where he finds himself involved with three witches, one of whom is the Wicked Witch under cover (and we know from the 1939 movie it's not Glinda The Good (Michelle Williams), so it must be Theodora (Mila Kunis) or Evanora (Rachel Weisz)). There is a prophecy that a Wizard will come to Oz out of the sky and rescue Oz from the clutches of the Wicked Witch, and Oz fits the bill. Except that Oz is a shallow conman.First, even though this treads similar ground to the wonderful musical Wicked (and the dreadful book on which it is based), there is no connection, and the story goes in very different directions.My verdict first - while there was much here which I liked I was, on the whole, disappointed. The film very carefully constructs itself to be a prequel to the 1939 film - it adopts the same structure of monochrome Kansas with ""real world"" analogues of Oz equivalents - and sets up the opening position of the 1939 film, and goes as far as adopting some elements of production design, and I very much liked all this together with production design in general and special effects specifically. But the things I didn't care for...Oz's initial arrival in Oz looked terrific, but I found myself distracted by a number of visuals clearly drawn from other movies (Disney's animated Alice and The Old Mill, to name two). Oz himself remained fairly unsympathetic throughout - it would have been nice to see some redemption happening earlier than the climactic showdown - and Franco's portrayal never made me think that this character had depths. I just plain don't like Rachel Weisz, and found her Evanora no more than adequate. And Mila Kunis, who I normally do like, never seemed fully committed to Theodora (conversely, I loved Michelle Williams and most of the supporting cast).But most of all, I felt annoyed that the film hadn't played fair with certain characters. I can't be specific without spoilering, but when the film ended, there was an injustice which was neither deserved nor put right, and that left me unhappy on a fundamental storytelling level. I haven't read all Baum's books, so I don't know whether this element was drawn from a book, but I doubt it.The 3D had its moments, but was far from essential. Like many things about this film, it could have been much more effective.",Oz the Great and Powerful
21,ferguson-6,A Woman Scorned,7,10 March 2013,"Greetings again from the darkness. It seems appropriate that anyone discussing or commenting on this movie should provide upfront disclosure regarding their stance on the classic The Wizard of Oz (1939). Having watched director Victor Fleming's original more than thirty times, I have no qualms in classifying myself as an unabashed fan. So it's understandable that trepidation accompanies every Oz fan into the theatre to watch director Sam Raimi's prequel.Mr. Raimi's career thus far has included two extremely popular special effects-driven franchises: Spider-Man (2002-07) and The Evil Dead (1981-92). His feel for imaginative visual effects remain in full force, and are evident from the opening credits. Unfortunately, Mr. Raimi was working with one hand tied behind his back thanks to the legal constraints that protect intellectual property. Author L Frank Baum's original children's books are public domain; however, Warner Brothers owns full rights to the 1939 film. This means the filmmakers had to tread lightly so as to avoid the legal whammy that goes with ""borrowing"" artistic rights. This is the reason we see no ruby slippers, and only tangential references to Dorothy Gale, the Scarecrow, the Cowardly Lion, etc. Still, don't be surprised if the news soon breaks of a lawsuit brought by Warner Bros against Disney.The film opens with an homage to the original. Filmed in Black & White and presented in original Academy screen ratio (square picture), we are introduced to Oscar (James Franco), a conniving carnival huckster who dreams of being a great man like his inspiration Thomas Edison. Oscar, nicknamed Oz, is seen as a womanizer with twisted character and lacking moral fiber. He briefly reconnects with Annie, a past Kansas fling played by Michelle Williams. She informs him that John Gale (clearly a relative to the future Dorothy) has proposed to her. We also meet Frank (Zach Braff) who is Oscar's loyal assistant and the brunt of his abuse after allowing Oz to be humiliated by the parents of a wheelchair bound girl (Joey King). This segment all lays the foundation for the rest of the story as we see what kind of man Oz is; and, we will soon cross paths again with the other key players.Of course, the story and movie really take off as Oscar is swept away in a twister and crash lands in full color and widescreen Land of Oz. His arrival plays like it's a planned ride at DisneyWorld ... complete with waterfalls, giant colorful flowers and buzzy little water fairies. Soon enough, Oscar meets a lovely local witch named Theodora (Mila Kunis). She and her sister Evanora (Rachel Weisz) explain the legend of the Wizard and how Oz can assume the throne and its accompanying wealth and power by killing off the Wicked Witch who destroyed the previous king.Oz travels with a talking, flying monkey (voiced by Zach Braff) who just wants to be friends and a broken china doll named China Doll (voiced by Joey King) who wants her family back (lost in a witch attack). Though this is supposedly the story of the transformation of Oz from a bad guy to a good guy, the best parts revolve around the three witches: the two sisters noted above and Glinda (Michelle Williams).The visuals in the movie are outstanding. My favorites include the Wicked Witch riding the smoking broom, the scary flying baboons, the smoke-and-mirrors climactic spectacle, and the amazing effects of China Doll. Michelle Williams is perfectly angelic as Glinda, and Rachel Weisz and Mila Kunis work wonders with their script-limited roles. Of course, capturing the menace and wonder of the great Margaret Hamilton from the original is a cinematic impossibility. So while the script is less than enthralling, the visuals and characters prove worthy to the source material. My only significant issue with the film is that I found James Franco to be distracting and miscast. Knowing that Robert Downey Jr was Raimi's first choice was like a jab in the ribs every time Franco's goofy and toothy approach marred a moment.My guess is that ""purists"" will be appalled by the thought of a prequel, while a whole generation of youngsters will be gleefully overwhelmed ... and if their parents are wise, the Baum books and the Fleming movie will be quickly introduced!",Oz the Great and Powerful
22,HotToastyRag,A perfect prequel; Franco shines,8,23 February 2020,"When you watch this adaptation of L. Frank Baum's classic story, keep in mind that it's not the same as the Judy Garland version. The titles are similar, but this one isn't about Dorothy getting swept away in a tornado; it's about the wizard. Before he was great and powerful, he was just a man trying to gain a little respect and adoration. Working rather unsuccessfully in a circus has left him disappointed, since he knows that had he made different choices, he could have had an entirely different life. If there's anyone who can show disappointment and a belief that he could have been better, it's James Franco. Perfectly cast and giving an exposing and poignant performance, he shines in this entertaining big-budget Disney adventure flick.There's so much to appreciate in this movie, from the beautiful visuals to the detailed screenplay, that took a huge chance on remaking a beloved classic. I loved it and was only left me with one letdown: why didn't Michelle Williams try to alter her voice to sound like Billie Burke? Mila Kunis showed her respect for her predecessor Margaret Hamilton, but Billie Burke's voice was one of the most memorable in the entire movie. Her high-pitched, fairy-like wobble was just as imitated as Frank Morgan's bumbling. James Franco's bumble-free performance was understandable because he wasn't in a constant state of nerves as a visitor threatened to expose his secret, but Glinda should have sounded like Glinda.It's risky to make a prequel about a beloved story, since added plot points might disappoint fans or create continuity issues. Thankfully, this one doesn't disappoint. Personally, I think it was a smart move of screenwriters David Lindsay-Abaire and Mitchell Kapner not to include Dorothy in their prequel. By featuring the wizard as a young man, there's very little opportunity for audiences to find discrepancies with the 1939 film. As it is, there are cute little touches that foreshadow the earlier film's events, like little cameos of the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion. I love the great tie-ins of the wizard's character that help explain how and why he does everything in the 1939 story. Since he has a circus background, he knows how to fool audiences with ""smoke and mirrors"" techniques to make it appear he's performing great feats. It's a great touch, and while most of the plot follows his involvement with the three witches of Oz-played by Michelle Williams, Rachel Weisz, and Mila Kunis-I was far more captivated by learning his backstory and motivations. Many viewers will be awed by the special effects, makeup, and lovely costumes as they dive into the wonderful world of Oz, but I enjoyed watching a man find his potential as he's given a fresh start in a new place.Since this was a Disney movie, there were tons of advertising and merchandise connected with the opening. I'm a great example that their campaign worked: Not only did I purchase the entire nail polish line that was introduced, but it was the nail polish that got me to go see the movie in theaters!DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. During the tornado scene, there are some spinning camera movements that will make you sick. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!""",Oz the Great and Powerful
23,FlashCallahan,It was my Grandmothers.......,2,14 March 2013,"Oscar is blown away to the vibrant Land of Oz. At first he thinks he's hit the jackpot-fame and fortune are his for the taking. That all changes, however, when he meets witches Theodora, Evanora, and Glinda, who doubt that he is the great wizard everyone's been expecting. Reluctantly drawn into the epic problems facing the Land of Oz and its inhabitants, Oscar must find out who is good and who is evil before it is too late. Putting his arts to use though, transform himself not only into the great and powerful Wizard, but into a better man as well...Raimi really hits an all time low with this, and like Alice In Wonderland (2010), its all style and hardly any substance.But at least it tries to tell a story, and the 3-D is sufficient in parts. The big problem with this movie is the whole second act. The Black and white segment is great, and the last ten minutes is okay, but the rest drags and drags, and the moment we hit Oz, it just maunders around With the story until the end.The cast are good, but the characters are a big problem. The titular character, even though the film urges him to be a better person, is just selfish through out, and it made me smile at the end, when he gives gifts, and he tells the china doll, you have us. It was supposed to be touching, but because of his trait, fell to deaf ears.Then there's the China doll. Take away the girl in the wheel chair, and the china doll, you could cut a good twenty minutes out of the film, making it a little more fluid and less boring. The scenes with Oz and the doll were the worst things about the film, they dragged it to a halt.Munis looked like The Mask when she had her big transformation, and the whole film looked too diabetic for me.Raimi was asked on Radio 5 if this was like an autobiographical piece to him, hike starting out small and now being like the titular character.I very much doubt it.It feels like he's sold out, and its doesn't have the soul of your typical Raimi movie.A huge disappointment.",Oz the Great and Powerful
24,zetes,"As good as it looks, it's impossible to get past the putrid script",5,10 March 2013,"Pretty darn lousy. I have nothing but praise for the technical aspects of the film. I think the special effects, production design and costume design in particular are award-worthy. The big flaw here is the script, which is mostly awful. The dialogue is leaden, the plot is perfunctory and the actors, of course, can't do anything to improve it and mostly come off as lost in a sea of pretty pictures. James Franco, who stars as the Wizard of Oz, newly arrived from Kansas and tasked with saving the kingdom from the two wicked witches (Rachel Weisz and Mila Kunis), seems as lost here as he did when he hosted the Oscars. Honestly, he's a decent actor. He deserved his Oscar nomination for 127 Hours. I wanted to smack that toothy grin off his face through most of this movie. Kunis is the second worst of the stars. Her character, Theodora, is particularly poorly written. Weisz and Michelle Williams (playing Glinda the Good Witch) don't quite embarrass themselves, which is about the most anyone can accomplish here. The other major players are Scrubs star Zach Braff and Joey King, who both appear as characters in the prologue and then again as voice actors. King's character, the China Doll, is one of the best CGI characters the cinema has yet to create, but all the script gives her to do is whine. Much like the Star Wars prequels, there's too many lame attempts to set up the classic ""sequel"", but it never quite makes any sense. I won't bemoan too much the demise of Sam Raimi, because that happened a long time ago. With the 2002 Spider-Man, I thought he might be a good filmmaker who could actually survive the transition to big budget. But, alas, he's become nothing more than a Hollywood hack. This might be his hackiest yet. A good director would have thrown the script in the screenwriters' faces and demanded a better one.",Oz the Great and Powerful

When watching Oz the Great and Powerful one finds out where the Wizard came from, Who and How the witch from the West is created. Sam Raimi is a great director who mixed 1940's style with modern C G I perfectly. The story is about how evil fights good with deceptions, half trues, and lies. The Wizard who is less magic and more con/brains battles evil with evil's own methods. I will not ruin the story buy giving away too much. What make Oz the Great and Powerful entertaining is Franco's performance as the Wizard. The Wizard is a mix of con, brains and a good heart, much like the Face character of the A team. One likes the Wizard even with his faults, and is entertained by wondering what he will do next? Worth watching. Seven out of ten stars.",Oz the Great and Powerful
26,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Oz the Great and Powerful,7,10 March 2013,"Bryan Singer left the superhero franchise and did an action-adventure-fantasy story with a twist in Jack the Giant Slayer, and it seems another superhero franchise alumni in Sam Raimi had opted to do the same, challenging himself with what would be an attempt to expand the Oz mythos written by L. Frank Baum, to include a suggested origin of the Wizard of Oz, a film that was done in MGM back in 1939 by Victor Fleming and is one of the all time classics in cinema starring Judy Garland in the role of Dorothy who had been swept away to the land of Oz and travelling on that yellow brick road in her search for the way home.But this attempt at an origin turned out to be nothing great nor powerful, but falling back to the cliché of the prophesied chosen one who had descended upon a land, and hailed as its saviour. In this case, he's up against two evil witches in Theodora (Mila Kunis) and Evanora (Rachel Weisz) who are currently rulers of the Emerald City, and keenly looking out for that great magician who would be their undoing. The only twist to this tale is that Oscar (James Franco), or Oz, is nothing but a small town magician and con who has a womanizing streak, whose street smarts and ways to break one's heart turn out to be weapons in his arsenal when found to be stuck in this strange new world courtesy of that whirlwind which we know will also be Dorothy's gateway to this fantasy realm.While this film has a story that ties in to that which Baum has created in his novels, there were a couple of legal wrangles or potential pitfalls that had prevented certain classical elements from appearing in this movie, which is quite a pity since the production took painstaking effort to try and create that look and feel quite like that which has so far been instantly recognizable by any who had seen Wizard of Oz the movie. Practical effects also had its place amongst the CG landscapes, which I thought had a colour palette similar to the earlier film. And if you've followed the troubles that had besieged this production, it's even more amazing that it finally pulled through to hit the big screens.However, for all its acting talent and stars at its disposal, Sam Raimi somehow still managed to make this a tad boring, with a middle arc that sagged not thanks to very lacklustre romantic affairs that Oz has with Theodora, which proved to be that final straw that broke the camel's back in her transformation into wickedness, and green with envy, since Oz had broken her heart with his affections for Glinda (Michelle Williams), who bore some resemblance to his Kansas girlfriend Annie whom he had advised to marry a better suitor. Naturally the story had an original idea here in making the witches contempt a lot more personal, but somehow this didn't ring well and true, and this heartbreaking romance between Oz and Theodora wasn't as pronounced as it could have been.James Franco though, did well as the titular character who is all flash and little substance, but having plenty of tricks up his sleeve to compensate for the lack of real magic. It's a tale about his transformation too, from cad to reliable schmuck, and the finale was nothing but a lot of nice touches that built up his Oz the Great persona, and what we have come to know of the magician. It's a wee bit unfortunate that Rachel Weisz and Michelle Williams were rather bland throughout, even with their final battle against each other, turned out to be nothing but the ability to float in the air coupled with basic level catfight.But this film had laid the foundation for a sequel that's already green lit, since evil has just only relocated and not completely vanquished, and the manner which it ended that seemed to suggest Oz still had plenty more adventures in his new found home. It's not surprising too, given the appearance of allies such as the Quadlings and the Munchkins, amongst other inhabitants and friends such as Finley the Flying Monkey (Zach Braff), China Girl (Joey King), Master Tinkerer (Bill Cobbs) and Knuck (Tony Cox), some of whom were included for comedic effect to counter-balance the darker thematic elements from the witches.",Oz the Great and Powerful
27,siderite,"Oz, the prequel",8,3 March 2014,"I liked the movie. It wasn't love, but I enjoyed watching it for its whole two hours. Sam Raimi, who some of you may know from horror movies/comedies starring Bruce Campbell, is directing, while James Franco and a threesome of beautiful girls star as the wizard and the witches.You will probably like to know that this is a prequel, an origin story to the trickster in the original Wizard of Oz. So, even if it all starts with a mysterious tornado, it features no flying houses, shoes or any small dog. Also some explanation for the origin of scared lions and scarecrows may be provided. The budget was too small for the likes of tin men. (or they were already booked for a Doctor Who episode)The story is ingenious, connecting a small travelling magician story with a very magical, yet very similar story when he gets in the land of Oz. The fact that his name is Oz and that one of the witches, his trusted monkey assistant and the china doll are played by actors playing characters in the real world as well suggests a dream explanation, although in the end none is provided anyway.In addition to the rascally smile of James Franco and his shenanigans in the pursuit of female kisses, you will be entertained by Mila Kunis, Rachel Weisz and Michelle Williams as beautiful witches. Zach Braff is the assistant and the voice of the monkey. Also funny cameos by Ted Raimi as the skeptic in the audience and Bruce Campbell as the ""Winkie Gate Keeper"" who gets knocked around by Tony Cox.Now, about the movie, it was an interesting take on the classic, with some nods to other Raimi movies and many of the elements of the original story, but in the end it was pretty self serving. Franco's character, Oz, finds the courage to love and be good, but also while getting to be great and ruling an entire kingdom and having a beautiful witch as his wife. Mila Kunis gets the short end of the stick from just about everybody, so believing is not always as cracked up to be. Rachel Weisz plays her role well, but one that has no explanation at all. I won't spoil the story, as obvious as it is, but what is the point of her character? Or its backstory? Are they going to make a prequel to the prequel so we can understand how it all got the way it was? Also flying monkey and china girl are some really unfortunate characters if you think about it.The special effects are nice, but we live in a time where special effects are always nice if you have enough money. The acting is rather good and the feel of the movie is nice, that is what matters most, I think, to actually see the actors enjoying themselves and to feel that the director had a love for both the original story and its movie incarnations as well as for movie making. Check out the scene where the munchkins want to sing and dance and Franco stops them rather abruptly. Really funny.Bottom line: I received a lot of bad reviews for this film, but I personally liked it. I agree with people that it didn't make much sense. It had bonus elements for people that watch completely different movies, it was too subtle and realistic to be enjoyed by children and too childish and direct in its manipulation of the viewers to be enjoyed by adults. I feel that, even as I liked the movie, I may be part of a small minority of people who can truly enjoy it.",Oz the Great and Powerful
28,StevePulaski,A lovely return to one of the most magical lands in cinema,8,13 March 2013,"The 1939 film The Wizard of Oz has become such a strong, beloved classic that many forget, or don't even know, that it originated from a beloved series of books prior to its transition on film. The last time I visited the Yellow Brick Road and the gray-toned, Kansas farmland had to be about two or three years ago, when the 70th anniversary edition was released in an expensive, yet worthy set. But in the present, it was only a matter of time before a visual filmmaker took on the challenge of remaking, rebooting, or making some sort of addition to the wonderful land of Oz, and, likewise, visionaire extraordinaire Sam Raimi stepped up to the plate to make a prequel to one of the most iconic, imaginative places in film history.Oz: The Great and Powerful is a joyous movie-going experience, and a complete break from some of the worst drivel the beginning months of a year could provide us with. We open in 1905 Kansas with con-artist Oscar ""Oz"" Diggs hosting his circus show (and yes, the entire first twenty minutes are captured in a 4:3 anamorphic ratio (where only about a third or more of the screen is used, which will evolve into 16:9 once we hit that magical place of Oz). Oz, who we see is a womanizer and a rather selfish cad, puts on a circus show, is discovered to be a fraud, and takes off in a hot air balloon after being chased by two very strong men.He gets caught up in a rough twister, and lands in the remarkably colorful world of Oz, where he first runs into Theodora (Mila Kunis). Theodora informs him that he is the one they read about in the Oz prophecies, which state that a man bearing the name of Oz will fall from the heavens to save and protect the land for eternity. Oz, who is fully aware that this is a bizarre coincidence, decides to play along and use his con-artist abilities to bathe in the gold he doesn't deserve and the luxuries as well. It is then that he finds out that he must defeat The Wicked Witch of the West in order to collect his earnings.Along the way, Oz runs into some eclectic characters, who are not as memorable as such beloved figures as the Tin Man, the Cowardly Lion, or the Scarecrow, but are welcomed additions to the story. They are a gorgeous porcelain doll, a loquacious monkey (voiced by Zach Braff), the annoying fanfare player (Tony Cox), and his love interest, Glinda the Good Witch (Michelle Williams). Giving these side-characters their time to shine further makes Oz excel at its overall goal; to be fun-loving, immersing, and innocent and inviting.If there's one piece of negativity I can get out of the way, it's that it takes a little while for the actors to completely assume their roles. For example, Franco needs about forty-five minutes before he becoming truly a charismatic, likable lead character, as he seems often outgunned in this big role. Mila Kunis is, surprisingly, a little wooden here, until the inevitable twist occurs, Michelle Williams is sometimes too bubbly, and Rachel Weisz's seems somewhat shortchanged, until her sassiness comes out. It takes a while for this cast to prove they work in their roles, but when they do, it becomes a miracle.Something must be said about the visual effects here, which are stunning and beautifully crafted. If nothing else visually satisfying comes out within the next nine months, I dare say that this could win Best Visual Effects/Best Costume Design at next year's Oscars. The colors are vibrant, the atmospheres are lush, and the entire effect it has on a viewer, young or old, is eye-popping and awe-inspiring. In a time where visual effect industries are greatly hurting, and the studio Rhythm and Hues can win an Oscar for their magnificent work on Life of Pi, yet still need to file for bankruptcy, there needs to be more of an appreciation for the fine area in film in-and-of itself.Alongside the visuals, the other strongest element for Oz's success is the way it erects this stunning world, complete with eccentric characters we're sure to remember and events that make us simply tingle. The easiest thing to compare this to is Tim Burton's recent retelling of Alice in Wonderland, a film that was dark and stylish, yet somewhat redundant seeing as that was the umpteenth time someone had told the story of Alice visiting the enchanted world. Here, it was wonderful to see the world of Oz on the big screen again, revised and made extravagant for 2013 by a true visionary of a filmmaker. If there's one thing I can say for this experience, it ain't Alice in Wonderland Redux.On a final note, the audience I saw Oz with was comprised of about sixty people, of all different ages, who had to be the most energetic, positive, and marveled audiences I've ever sat with. Seeing the 2D showing at an early-morning matinée, everyone seemed to applaud every mythical set-piece, laugh at every small joke, pun, or cute instance, and even shriek in terror during the final sequences. One thing that Walt Disney, and Raimi, for that matter, had to be concerned about was how audiences would perceive and respond to revisiting a classic place that was portrayed so wonderfully back in 1939. I assume the overwhelming positivity was showing what kind of effect the world of Oz has on viewers; it's whimsical, bright, vibrant, occasionally dark, but always impressively invigorating.My video review of Oz: The Great and Powerful, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lqdyiUpxIA Starring: James Franco, Mila Kunis, Michelle Williams, Rachel Weisz, Zach Braff (voice), and Tony Cox.

29,KineticSeoul,Forgettable and predictable fantasy adventure,5,30 March 2013,"This one is suppose to be a prequel to ""The Wizard of Oz"" which is actually a cool idea. But it's just nowhere near as good. It's becomes a dull and for the most part a predictable adventure, despite few twist then and there. This movie cost over 200 million dollars to make and it just doesn't show at all. In fact for the most part it just seemed like a wast of money for the production company and studio, probably also others that invested in this movie being made. It just has a very dull script going for and nothing really stands. I just wasn't really engaged with this flick. James Franco is alright as OZ but didn't stand out with his role all that much either. I give credit for this flick trying to be it's own movie. With just references and backgrounds to ""The Wizard of Oz"". Instead of constantly trying to make connections to that movie. This one hardly have any musical numbers, maybe one but it's forgettable. This one had potential but it turned out bland.5/10",Oz the Great and Powerful
30,sddavis63,A Well Done Prequel Explaining How The Wizard Of Oz Became The Wizard Of Oz.,7,9 June 2013,"I have to say that I was surprisingly impressed with this film. I wanted to see it, and yet at the same time I was hesitant to see it. So much has been done with the original story by L. Frank Baum that I wondered if this wasn't overkill. But recently I saw Andrew Lloyd Webber's stage version of The Wizard of Oz and found it surprisingly fresh and enjoyable. It renewed my interest in this film directed by Sam Raimi. This isn't The Wizard of Oz, of course. It's a prequel. It's the story of how Oz became Oz, and it doesn't disappoint. Let's face it - that's a question that, in my experience, hasn't really been answered before in any significant way. ""Oz"" in this movie is Oscar Diggs - a small time magician and big time con man, who gets caught up in a cyclone and finds himself in a strange land, where he's immediately proclaimed the great wizard of prophecy who will lead the land's strange inhabitants against the wicked witch trying to oppress them. Oz is thrilled with his good fortune at first as he surveys his new realm, and the Emerald City at its centre, until he discovers that battling wicked witches is no picnic!Oz is played by James Franco. Franco was all right in the role. There's no specific criticism I would make of him. It's just that for some reason, and surprisingly because I'm really not a fan of his, I kept thinking all the way through that I could have seen Jim Carrey doing more with this role than Franco did. But Franco didn't hurt the film. I just had those inexplicable thoughts of Carrey. The witches are played by Mila Kunis, Rachel Weisz and Michelle Williams. Weisz was Evanora, the wicked witch, Kunis was Theodora, the first to encounter Oz, who becomes smitten with him then turns against him and becomes the familiar green-skinned wicked witch, and Oz's great antagonist. Williams played Glinda, the good witch. The witches were fine, with Kunis perhaps being the weakest of the three, but quite passable.I liked the inclusion in this of the china doll from Baum's story, who didn't make the movie version. The weakest part of the movie may have ironically been what was clearly intended to be the climax - the final battle against the wicked witches. It was too long and overdone. Overall, though, this was enjoyable. Raimi did well creating a believable land of Oz, although I wasn't convinced of the need to redo the shift from black and white to colour to contrast Kansas with Oz.

31,Hellmant,It's sad to see the once great indie filmmaker resorting to making brainless big budget eye candy with no heart.,7,11 March 2013,"'OZ THE GREAT AND POWERFUL': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Walt Disney Studios and Sam Raimi's prequel to the classic 1939 kids' film 'THE WIZARD OF OZ' (and the 1900 book that it's based on). The film is inspired by author L. Frank Baum's 'OZ' novels but it's not based on any book in particular. It tells of the origins of the wizard OZ as well as the 'The Wicked Witch of the West'. James Franco (who worked with Raimi on all three 'SPIDER-MAN' films as well, stars in the movie as OZ and Mila Kunis, Michelle Williams and Rachel Weisz co-star as three witches. The movie had a budget of $200 million and it shows but other than great visuals and spectacular action the movie has little else to offer.Franco plays Oscar Diggs, a con artist and magician with shady ethics and a very self centered ego. He travels to the magical land of OZ when he flees a jealous boyfriend in a hot air balloon and gets caught in a tornado. One thing that's cool about the film is that it begins in black-and-white and a 4:3 Academy ratio and changes to color and 16:9 widescreen when Oscar arrives in OZ, much like the original film (also the 3D gets a lot better in OZ as the colors are much brighter and the visuals are much more beautiful). Once in OZ Oscar meets an assortment of characters (including a monkey, a China Girl marionette and three witches) who all think he's the great wizard OZ they've been waiting for to save them. Drawn to the fame and fortune Oscar plays along with this fantasy, and eventually helps the people, while learning to be a better person in the process.I've heard people compare this film to the first 'STAR WARS' prequel, 'THE PHANTOM MENACE', but even that was better than this (the original 1985 sequel, 'RETURN TO OZ', was better than this as well). The characters are all somewhat likable and there's some good humor throughout the film but there's also a lot of bad melodrama that seems really forced and the film often feels like it's just going through the motions. The acting is all decent but the script could have used a few more rewrites and Raimi's directing is uninspired. It's sad to see the once great indie filmmaker resorting to making brainless big budget eye candy with no heart. That's the most disappointing thing about the film, to see Sam Raimi sell out so badly (I even liked 'SPIDER-MAN 3' a great deal more than this). The visuals and action are spectacular (especially in 3D) though and kids should enjoy it.",Oz the Great and Powerful
32,Buddy-51,Enjoyable if you properly gauge your expectations,6,24 September 2013,"If you just accept as a given that no movie will ever be able to recreate the magic of a beloved classic like ""The Wizard of Oz,"" then you can have a pretty good time with ""Oz the Great and Powerful,"" a lavish, visually dazzling prequel to both the 1939 movie and the L. Frank Baum novels that inspired it.The movie, with screenplay by Mitchell Kapner and David Lindsay-Abaire and direction by Sam Raimi, tells us what happened long before young Dorothy Gale from Kansas skipped along the Yellow Brick Road with her three companions - the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, the Cowardly Lion - and her little dog Toto in tow. It shows how a second-rate carnival magician - a self-described con man and humbug - is carried away by a tornado from a black-and-white, turn-of-the-20th Century Kansas (a clear homage to the original film) to a magical, multi-colored land that just happens to bear his name, Oz (short for Oscar). There he encounters an assortment of strange, funny-looking people and creatures, along with three witches, one of whom, Glinda (Michelle Williams), is good, while the other two, sisters in fact (Mila Kunis and Rachel Weisz), are evil. Oz also learns that the inhabitants of the land have been faithfully awaiting the arrival of a messianic ""wizard,"" whom it is prophesied, will free them all from bondage to the wicked witches. The movie not only shows how the wizard ultimately becomes the wizard but how the Wicked Witch of the West ultimately becomes the Wicked Witch of the West.In many ways, ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" is really just a rehash of the original story, only with the magician in the role of Dorothy this time around. And while the movie could definitely use some trimming from its overlong 130-minute running time, it's worth seeing for its dazzling re-creation of the land of Oz alone. Its visual schema remains faithful to the original, matching the colors, costumes and art direction almost to perfection, and it is, of course, enhanced by all the marvels that modern CGI technology can provide. And as with the original, this new ""Oz"" has some of the actors doing double duty, appearing in both the black-and-white and color sequences in the film, and it nicely re-creates a number of key scenes from ""The Wizard of Oz."" In fact, the best thing to be said for this version is that its makers clearly revere the original as much as the rest of us do and they are careful not to violate either its look or its spirit.In the final analysis, ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" clearly lacks the emotional resonance, brilliant characterizations, great score, and enduring themes of the original (that would be a pretty tall order for any filmmakers to fulfill), but Franco makes such a disarming wizard and the whole thing looks just so darn spectacular that you may not mind so much that it doesn't achieve the impossible.",Oz the Great and Powerful
33,thesar-2,Oz You Wish,5,9 March 2013,"The original has been remade, reimagined, rewritten, sequelized, prequelized, spoofed, referenced and play'gerized (Broadway) more times that I can recall, seen or read. In fact, of the dozens of incarnations, I've only seen the 1939 work of art, the Muppet's hilarious take and now: Oz the Great and Powerful.Luckily, this AM, before I set out to see the latest take, or prequel, I had the wonderful opportunity to see the Judy Garland film; my first time since I was a very young child. That might have been a bad choice considering how much of a difference between that masterpiece and this movie.Yes. That is the biggest difference between what a fantastic, magical, wonderful and, ah-hem, great experience the original was and this, just a movie. Sure, Director Sam Raimi, whom I've always been a huge fan of, did create a gorgeous – stunning, even – cinematic film, but it never felt above ""movie status,"" much like the original which felt alive.I didn't quite catch Oz's (James Franco) full name, but that's his coincidental nickname to the land he will be thrust to following an escape from people he's wronged in a traveling circus. Once he arrives – and believe me, that entry scene was well worth the IMAX 3D experience, he's immediately deemed ""the one"" that will save all of Oz and become King.The rest of the movie plays out with Oz meeting several interesting characters – the top of the bunch is Finley or ""Monkey,"" his accepting/denying his prophesied role and the rise of wickedness.Unlike most movies I see, this movie got progressively better as it past its center point and through to the climax. The opening black & white square formatted introduction, however, while an obvious homage to the original, went on for far too long and felt like I wasted extra money to see this in the higher ticket priced IMAX format. Luckily, and inevitably, it switched to (mostly) full-IMAX screen and color. Again, the scene following the black & white bit was one of the best in the movie with our ""hero"" Oz travelling down the river bank.I'm not a huge James Franco fan, and this certainly did not change my mind, but, thankfully there were a couple of other good performances and characters, namely Zach Braff as mentioned as Finley, the CGI monkey with wings and Michelle Williams as Glinda, the Good Witch. On the flipside, one of the ""key players,"" the world-famous Wicked Witch of the West, was hilariously bad. Her green face make-up/CGI/whatever looked absolutely atrocious and unintentionally humorous. Sad. She was the Darth Vader-type iconic villain staple decades before Anakin donned the mask and now, in appearance only, she looks more like Jackie Earle Haley's Freddy Krueger compared to Robert Englund's.The real star, and this shouldn't have been the case, was the rich and crisp scenery. Definitely breathtaking at moments. The score was a decent, though forgettable, Danny Elfman run-through. The 3D was just okay and had just a few obvious ""throw-things-at-the-screen"" shots which I don't care for. And despite the absence of the musical numbers, the humor was enormously welcomed and often hilarious. Thanks to Braff's Finley and Tony Cox's Knuck.Overall, I would recommend it, for maybe curiosity's sake and to see such great cinematography and graphics on the big screen. Repeated viewings? Not so much.",Oz the Great and Powerful
34,Robert_duder,Visually spectacular fairy tale that does an adequate job,8,11 March 2013,"Oz The Great and Powerful tries so hard to be epic. It often does feel epic. It so heavily laden with special effects that its hard to weed through all that and see the heart and soul of the film. There are aspects of the movie that are brilliant and there were things that I thought needed some work. Sometimes I thought the pacing of the film was a little off, it definitely seemed to drag a lot but then at the same time I was glad that they took the time to develop the world and the characters being so heavily laden with special effects. I would have to guess that 80% or more of this film was CGI and inevitably there were a couple of scenes that looked nearly cartoonish. Still I give them incredible props because they paid a certain respect to the original classic film, they were able to be facetious and poke fun at the quirky cheese of the concept without making it feel like they were blatantly making fun of the material. It felt like the film makers still cared about everything in Oz but could still identify and have fun with the campy side of it too. The only time that hurt them I thought was in the portrayal of the witches but I will get to that because I do believe it was on purpose.James Franco was really the perfect choice for the Wizard. He is quirky and unique actor who can just embrace any character and he has the right mood, feel and chemistry to play this Wizard and make you care about him. Mila Kunis starts out as a straight laced, very conservative good witch and transformers brilliantly into this over the top, gaudy wicked witch that channels the old witch from the 1939 classic well giving her a flare and an evil slant of her own. I thought her performance and the character was a perfectly cast and created over dramatic villain that worked in the world they created. I always like Rachel Weisz but I found her a little dry in this movie. I mean putting her next to Kunis after her evil transformation and she becomes almost unnecessary. She is always welcome in a cast but I just don't think she was entirely used very well in the movie. Michelle Williams gives a very...controversial performance. I say that because it is an incredibly campy performance. Her tone of voice, her big eyelashes and over-dramatic pronunciation and purity make her seem too cheesy in the beginning. I truly think that this was the point of her character and they directed her to do this but I just wasn't sure how I felt about it. Her character got better but it was still a very thin line. I also still am not sure the romance between her and Oz was necessary. Zach Braff and his character Finley was brilliant. Finley was the stereotypical Disney ""sidekick"" but that isn't an insult. He is the comic relief, he is adorable and the CGI used for him was brilliant. I can't wait to see more from him in sequels. Joey King brings China Girl to life. She is a brilliant, unique character that was fun and important and just really well done. She was the perfect addition to the Oz cast of characters.Sam Raimi is all over the board as a director. He has done just about literally everything. I think this is his masterpiece as far as a visual spectacle. He clearly laboured over this for a long time and his hard work pays off. Its dark, gloomy, bright, shiny, exuberant, sad, stunning, campy...all at once...all rolled into one modern day fairy tale remade from an old classic story. Origins for the wizard fit so well into the original film lore while still paying respect to Baum's original stories. It is a very dark film at times, it certainly will be scary for young children but older children will certainly love it. There is no denying that Disney magic is alive and well. It isn't perfect and has its shortcomings but I still had a great time and I look forward to seeing its inevitable sequels! 8/10",Oz the Great and Powerful
35,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Oz, no comma or colon.",6,11 December 2018,"Why everything needs to be explained in Hollywood, milked for monetary gain, is still a mystery to me - though, I think I just hit upon the reason right there: monetary gain. This is just another keen example of a sequel - or, in this case, prequel - to a beloved classic that aims to cash in on its franchise's brand recognition, though it's not like the 'Oz' series is an entirely pure one (simply because it was already a franchise, of sorts, before this entry came into being). I guess this film is trying to do something somewhat different but it does, ultimately, take a well-worn concept and simply apply it to a well-known world. It occasionally effectively examines a rather strange character - considering that he's perhaps the only fraudster in a world full of clearly 'real' magic - and makes for an entertaining time in the process, but also it falls into convention just as often - if not more so - and removes the ambiguity of the first picture (unless this could all somehow be a dream of Dorothy's, too). 6/10",Oz the Great and Powerful
36,bowmanblue,At last ... a prequel that works (George Lucas - take note!),8,4 August 2014,"'Oz - the Great and the Powerful,' in case you don't know, is a prequel to the classic Wizard of Oz film of the 1930s, showing how the wizard himself got to the magical land and his encounters with the witches before Dorothy squashed one and doused the other.My hopes weren't high when I went in to see this. Maybe that's the key to enjoying it - don't expect too much. My theories of prequels and re-envisionings is based on film companies trying to cash in on popular franchises and trying to squeeze that last bit of cash out of them.However, Oz actually works. It seems that some thought has actually been put into making up a genuinely new story which wasn't touched upon by what you've already seen.I thought it was a great film which actually adds to the 'Oz legend' rather than cashes in on it. It's got just the right mixture of humour, adventure, new quirky characters and menacing threat (but not too menacing, as it's pretty suitable for any child who enjoys fairy tales).It's not all perfect, there are some minor grumps. First of all, some aspects of the much-loved tale are owned by a different company who made this film, therefore popular aspects, such as the ruby slippers have been omitted. Plus there's too much computer-generated scenery. The backgrounds, while nice, look pretty unreal and you can tell what's a set and what's a green screen (think Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland). Plus some people have criticised Mila Kunis, saying she was brought in more for her star power, rather than her ability as an actress.But these are all minor gripes. If you can ignore them and put your heart and soul into this movie, then you should feel right at home in a magical land where little people sing at the drop of a hat (there's only one - half - song this time).Enjoy it (and, for Bruce Campbell fans - watch out for his cameo, courtesy of his friend and director, Sam Raimi).http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",Oz the Great and Powerful

38,Cineanalyst,The Wizard of Menlo Park: Disneyland Meets the Land of Oz,5,12 January 2020,"Possibly to some's abiding resentment, the most popular children's film of all time (""The WIzard of Oz"" (1939)) has never been the property of the most popular studio (Disney) to ever produce and distribute children's movies. This, too, is despite Disney, if only subsequently and partly, controlling the two main sources of inspiration for the 1939 production: the rights to the books by L. Frank Baum, the first of which the film was based upon, and their landmark film ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" (1937), which became a model for MGM's adaptation and, indeed, for following children's films in general. Founder Walt Disney was obsessed with another--and vastly superior--children's book series, Lewis Carroll's Alice books. But, Disney has always been cloying and simplistic, and so they bowdlerized that text, repeatedly and most recently with their 2010 ""Alice in Wonderland"" and 2016 ""Alice Through the Looking Glass"" travesties. Baum's books, on the other hand, are relatively bland (despite the protestations of Michael Patrick Hearn, who in ""The Annotated Wizard of Oz"" has the fool's errand of pretending the first Oz book to be great literature). Therefore, Oz is much better suited than Carroll's complexly-layered dreamworlds ever were to Disney's bluntly formulaic practices.Appropriately, too, ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" doesn't take its cues from Baum's ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"" and the rest of the series, but rather, to the extent that Disney's lawyers can shield them from lawsuits, from the 1939 picture. The MGM film has largely supplanted Baum's original interpretation in the popular imagination and for good reason, as it improves upon the literary source in every important regard. So, Disney begins their tale of Oz in black-and-white Kansas, too, including with the old square aspect ratio--before transitioning to color and widescreen after the protagonist is transported by tornado to the land of Oz. Like Judy Garland's Dorothy and quite unlike Baum's balloonist of Omaha turned wizard of Oz. From there, they recycle the prophesied quest narrative also employed for the 2010 ""Alice in Wonderland"" despite it having no connection to either of the books the movies are supposedly a continuation of. I speculate that this messiah myth has more to do with another set of kids novels by another Lewis, C.S. The 2010 and 2016 Alice movies, at least, seem to take a few pages from ""The Chronicles of Narnia."" Anyways, fortunately, Disney nixes the singing and dancing again, although the studio's usual constant sentimental underscoring remains. One of the improvements MGM made over Disney was in the musical department, which was doubtless in large part thanks to casting the talented Garland, but, regardless, ""Ding Dong! the Witch is Dead,"" say, let alone ""Over the Rainbow,"" was already craftier than something like ""Heigh-Ho.""What Disney does importantly copy from the 1939 ""The Wizard of Oz"" is the self-reference to the illusion of motion pictures. As opposed to Baum's wizard, MGM's was only smoke and mirrors--a giant projected image of his head. So, too, Disney's wizard. Moreover, the allusion to movies is made more explicit here by reference to the Wizard of Menlo Park, Thomas Edison. Like the Wizard of Oz, Edison was something of a ""humbug,"" too. James Franco's Wizard credits Edison with everything from the lightbulb, to the phonograph and motion pictures. You know, the common myth of him as the primary agent behind some of the turn-of-the-century's most important inventions, with the misleading suggestion that he did it himself. In fact, Edison did much like the Wizard of Oz in this movie does. He employed factories of laborers and other inventors to complete his half-formed notions. Sometimes, he didn't do much more than ask his employees, as he does with the balloon here, to invent the whole thing for him. And, much of these inventions, as here, were already invented afore in another land by others. Like Disney and its copyrighting, Edison, then, patented it all, for the purposes of his real business of making lots of money.Take the projection device used in ""Oz the Great and Powerful,"" for instance. Since this prequel takes place years before Dorothy Gale was supposedly born and decades before ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"" was published in 1900, there's no system or film projection (or films, at all, for that matter) that can be non-anachronistically attributed to Edison, or his team of inventors led by W.K.L. Dickson. So, the movie includes the Praxinoscope, which could project images from the spinning wheel of a zoetrope. This was invented by Charles-Émile Reynaud, who I don't recall being mentioned once throughout ""Oz the Great and Powerful."" That's a shame, too, for, although he was French and Baum's fairy tale was quintessentially American, Reynaud was not only one of the inventors of film projection, but of animated film, which has likewise become Disney's legacy, from as far back as that early feature-length cartoon, ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,"" and even before that. The ""Avatar"" (2009)-looking CGI employed in ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" is merely another form of animation, as well. Only part of this movie is live action and even then the performances tend to be cartoonish (although I think Michelle Williams and Rachel Weisz are far too good of actresses to be wasted on this trifle).Plus, Disney does some of the best self-promotion with their logo in this movie that I've ever seen. Before the nickelodeon and puppetry imagery of the opening credits, the Disney logo is presented in black and white as with the rest of the movie's prologue. This, however, is matched with color and widescreen in the climax, with an Emerald City that's shaped strikingly similar to the theme park and Cinderella palace outline of the Disney logo. Heck, there are even fireworks. I'll take a dozen sequels to this self-referential self-promotion of a reworking of the ""Wizard of Oz"" to another butchering by this studio of the Alice books any day. The lands of Disney and Oz seem a natural fit.P.S. I'd recommend Disney work on improving their puns, though. Oz misnaming Glinda as ""Wanda,"" I assume because she carries a wand, duh, doesn't compare favorably to those of Baum. The best thing about his book may be the punnery he made out of the Scarecrow's brains (sharp with pins and needles), the Tin Man's heart (soft, as made with silk) and the Lion's (liquid) courage.",Oz the Great and Powerful
39,g-bodyl,"Beautiful, Magical Film!",9,10 July 2014,"Oz the Great and Powerful is the prequel to the 1939 classic, the Wizard of Oz. Of course this film doesn't reach the majestic heights of that film, but there is still magic prevalent in the air and it's a worthy prequel. It's beautiful to look at and with today's CGI capabilities, the land of Oz has never looked better. Not only is this film visually competent, the story is great and it certainly ties up loose ends very well.Sam Raimi, who we all know very well from the Spider-Man trilogy, directs this film. This film is about a circus performer with dubious ethics named Oscar Diggs who is transported to the Land of Oz, where he meets three witches who doubt his abilities as the Wizard. While in Oz, Diggs must not only come to terms with himself, but he must stop darkness from spreading all over Oz.Now you can say all you want about James Franco, but I thought he did a good job as Diggs. I mean, his performance is not anything special, but at least he turns in a believable performance. Mila Kunis was okay at first, but she did get somewhat aggravating as the Wicked Witch of the West. Rachel Weisz does an excellent job and has one of the best roles. Finally, Michelle Williams does a great job as Glinda, the only good witch.Overall, Oz the Great and Powerful is a very fun, action-packed film that explores the origins of Oz and the Wizard. It's nice to see some characters we love such as the Munchkins. The CGI is impressive and we see that with a flying monkey and a talking glass doll. The score by Danny Elfman is great. This film could have been so much darker, but I laud Raimi for keeping a light-hearted tone to this film. I rate this film 9/10.",Oz the Great and Powerful

42,Irishchatter,It's never good as 'The Wizard of Oz' or the musical 'Wicked',1,25 December 2015,"I thought this film shouldn't be ever made since it really does destroy a bit of 'Wizard of Oz'. The Wizard was not meant to be a young dude, he was meant to be an old guy that is lovable and very jolly. James Franco was a bad choice to play as the wizard, he just doesn't have that in him. He's a good actor but like his other movie 'The Interview' and on this, these are the worst movies he has ever done in his film career. I meant it! It was also a really bad choice for Mila Kunis to play the Wicked Witch because she really acts too good to be a villain. The makeup wasn't even great on her, it made her look like she was having botox or allergic to it. For a beautiful talent actress like herself, don't put on too makeup or else it'll be a disaster! I didn't even like the fact she became green just because she ate a green apple. That never happen, the witch was born green, she wasn't even pale, could they not concentrate more on the 1939 film? I guess they didn't which is stupid! I would not show this to my future kids to this because it's just a terribly bad made movie!",Oz the Great and Powerful

I say A-,9,8 June 2013,"""I know I'm not the wizard you were expecting, but I might just be the wizard you need."" Oz (Franco) is a struggling magician in a little town in Kansas. After being chased by a jealous man he hops into a hot air balloon for an escape and soon finds himself face to face with a twister. When it's all over he finds himself in a strange land called Oz. This is a movie that I was looking forward to seeing but was a little hesitant. One reason was that I love the Wizard Of Oz and was afraid this would ruin the mystique of that movie. The other reason was I wasn't sure how you make a prequel to a movie that was a dream in the first place. That out of the way I really enjoyed this a lot. The characters are great and the movie really does a great job of setting up what will be seen in the Wizard Of Oz. This is a really good family movie even though there are a few pretty creepy parts in this. Overall, a very good movie that deserves to carry the title of Oz. I highly recommend this movie.

45,vincentlynch-moonoi,"We're off to see the wizard, the sorta wonderful Wizard Of Oz",8,18 March 2013,"I might as well get this out of the way first. I have yet see the attraction to James Franco. I don't like his hair. Or his teeth! Or his wrinkled smile. Or his diction. Or anything else about him. How does this man sell box office? I don't get it. And throughout the film I kept thinking in scene after scene -- Robert Downey could have been enchanting here (and he was in consideration for the part).Having finished that rant, I'm not saying this is not a good film. That's what it is -- a good film. Not a great film. And a major reason for feeling that way -- and it's something that ruined that last Indiana Jones movie for me -- you knew while you were watching it that almost everything you saw was computer animated graphics. There were very few real sets. I felt like it was Franco and the witches walking through a cartoon. Perhaps I'm reaching that point where I'm becoming less and less impressed with computer graphics as a substitute for good old-fashioned movie making. But, we know that the use of computer graphics makes it cheaper to make good films...hence the $215 million price tag of this film.Nevertheless, this film has some very good points. First, I was pleased to see that the director frequently played homage to the original 1939 film in various ways. And I burst out laughing in the scene where the Munchkins started singing and dancing like the Munchkins of old.The story line is pretty decent, although it doesn't have the empathy factor of the original. Think how we loved Dorothy, and the Cowardly Lion, and the Tin Man, and the Scarecrow. We simply don't feel that way about Franco, or an animated China doll (although she was a cute not-real character), or a computer animated flying monkey that you know wasn't even there when each scene was shot. But again, the plot was okay.In terms of the witches, Mila Kunis and Rachel Weisz did very well, although I personally felt that Michelle Williams was the best of the three. Zach Braff, who I thought very highly of in television, didn't impress me much here in his human role, but the voice he contributed for the flying monkey was done nicely. And then there are the various people of Oz, of all sorts and sizes. Nicely done, with appropriate references to the 1939 film.The magic still belongs to 1939, but that's not to say that I'm not glad that Disney did this film. It sets up the 1939 flick nicely. And I wouldn't mind a sequel to the two films.",Oz the Great and Powerful
46,atlasmb,The Wizard Finds His Oz,7,25 March 2014,"""Oz the Great and Powerful"" is a prequel to the MGM production of 1939. Instead of following Dorothy's journey to Oz and back, this film follows ""Oz"", a carnival magician who leaves Kansas in a hurry and finds himself in the Land of Oz.This film is a feast for the eyes. Full of special effects and vivid colors. Sometimes special effects take over a film, and I feel that happened with this film. Gone is the human feeling of ""The Wizard of Oz"". The actors do a fine job of portraying the characters, but their roles feel minimized by the volume and dynamism of the effects taking place around them. This does not make the film a disaster, but it changes its nature. The movie ""300"" might get the same criticism, but that was a film about brutality; it did not require a tender humanity. ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" would be, in my opinion, a better film if the humanity of its characters was not subsumed by the never ending effects they played with and around. The script is partly to blame, seeming to place more emphasis on spectacle once it left Kansas. Still, it is fun to watch the numerous references to the story from 1939 and to place the happenings of this prequel in a historic sequence with Dorothy's adventure.",Oz the Great and Powerful

No one dies, there's no jokes inadequate for kids, it's tame fairy-tale, but it's beautifully written, designed and filmed and in the given limits it's the very best Disney movie I saw. I'm not sure, but I suppose that story is prequel to classic Wizard of Oz tale. Nothing here is superb, but there's no flaws either and I warmly recommend it to all fairy-tale and/or Mila Kunis fans.8/10",Oz the Great and Powerful
48,tabuno,Dazzling Visual Fantasy that Strangely Leaves a Mildly Bitter Taste at the End,7,24 January 2019,"Spoiler alert. James Franco headlines this prequel to the classic Wizard of Oz (1939) version where director Sam Raimi depicts a gray black and white Kansas on a television box screen format transforming it into a full screened, brilliant colored fantasy landscape when Franco's character is transported into a dazzling world of magic. The second part of the first half of the movie is filled with these amazing visual effects. The movie script consistently wraps up an origination story to The Wizard of Oz but strangely enough leaves a sour taste in one's mouth considering how the Evil Witch came to be and Franco's character's role in creating the Evil Witch. In many ways, this movie offers up a standard magical fantasy affair along with a rather convincing twist by the middle of the movie along with some strong relational elements that at times tears at one's emotional sensitivities.",Oz the Great and Powerful
49,ironhorse_iv,We're off to see the Wizard! The Wonderful Wizard of Oz!,7,17 March 2013,"Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain says, the 1939 MGM Classic's Wizard. Like how Dorothy finds out the truth that movie, we see the man behind the curtain once again. This movie pulls that curtain further, exposing Oscar Diggs (James Franco) for who he is. He's still not powerful or great, but also a womanizer and greedy hungry. He would be more unlikeable to the audience, if only stop by James Franco's good looks and charm. The character redemption arch come way too late in the film. You can't help hating him for all the bad things he does on the way. Also he is a bit annoying with the over use of yelling and complaining. It's like you want him to shut up in some scenes. Franco might be a little typecast. He is a young man playing an older man in this role. I just don't see Oscar Diggs as a young man. Still, the movie is set 34 years before the 1939's film so it's OK in a way. The movie is the story of his rise to power in the Land of Oz. The movie starts out in 1905 Kansas, working as small-time magician in a traveling circus. The opening is pretty catchy, reminds me of the creepy circus song of Elephant Man. Great work for Danny Elfman. As a storm approaches the circus, Oscar tries to escapes in a hot air balloon, but is sucked into a tornado that brings him to the Land of Oz. There, he meets the witch Theodora (Mila Kunis) who believes him to be a wizard prophesied to overthrow the Wicked Witch who killed the king of Oz. Evanora (Rachel Weisz) Theodora's sister doesn't think so. Both witches send him to kill the Wicked Witch to prove that he is powerful. He meets cute flying monkey Finley (Zach Braff), Glinda the Good Witch (Michelle Williams) and China Girl (Joey Ryan) on his way to free Oz from the evil Wicked Witches. For the fans of director Sam Raismi, Bruce Campbell also starts. There are a lot of emotional scenes in this movie such as the China Town scene and what happen to Theodora. Both Finley and China Girl was cute characters. Still, the acting is lacking here. Kunis is just awkwardly bad with her delivery and Williams is bland as hell. Just disappointed. The script was filled with cheesy & laughable dialogue, but still works, but there were some plot holes to point out. I know the production team were often pressed the concern of abiding by the stipulations set forth by Warner Bros., the legal owner of the rights to iconic elements of the 1939 MGM film including the ruby slippers worn by Judy Garland. So the Ruby slippers story line couldn't get explain. Still, it's a gaping hole in the films logic. Also Disney was unable to use them nor any character likenesses from that particular film like Dorothy, Cowardly Lion, the Scarecrow, or Tin Man. Still, they were able to hint the oncoming of those characters by having the film also features allusions to L. Frank Baum's original novel such as Scarecrows being built by the townspeople as a scare tactic; the Tin Man, whose creator is introduced as the Master Tinker; and the Cowardly Lion, who is frightened away by Oscar after attacking Finley. Also notes to the beginning where Annie (Michelle Williams) is getting marry to somebody name Gale. The only reason that they got away with Wicked Witch was because they used a different color of green for her skin. Sure. Still, these gaping stipulations makes the film's logic jump a bit. The biggest one is if the Wizard was already in Oz by the time Dorothy comes into play, for whom those Dorothy meet in Kansas in the opening of Wizard of Oz? That will hurt your head trying to explain that. The film had some pacing problems and tonal inconsistencies. The visuals were great, but they really need forced 3D scenes and CGI overkilled. It was too much. A lot of the weird moments seemed to have been included just for 3D Movie effect as a sort of cheesy jump scare. It wasn't that bad of a film. Mildly diverting and clever in spots, this film is certainly no bookend for the 1939 classic that introduced author L. Frank Baum's fanciful adventure to a wider world. It's hard to one up the original anyways.",Oz the Great and Powerful
50,nairtejas,More Than A Fairy Tale!,8,14 March 2013,"Well, I enjoyed the special effects, casting, and the vividness of this 120 minute tale of almost predictable storyline.James Franco suits aptly as the wizard Oz, while Mila Kunis disappointed me maybe because most of the time she isn't portrayed cleverly. Rachel Weisz is elegant & so is Michelle Williams. The rest of the cast were almost perfect.Now, with the humor & story I am depressed a bit and even though I haven't watched the 1939 movie, I slightly felt that most of the imagination is left to the viewer. Implications of a fairy land and the prophecy ultimatum is also left to the viewers. Magic wands & witches made it an interesting watch as I expected more of it to flash on the screen without an iota of superfluous shenanigans but clever introductory phrases & sequences filled with color, fancy & marvel & magic.Oz The Great & Powerful is a very good fairy tale as it speaks about Edison and induces hope in the minds of its audience. The lead character not only uses the stereotype but also improvises it to make us believe... believe in ourselves.Although, I still have oodles of unanswered questions, I rate it a gigantic 8/10 for its pure magic on screen without much melodrama as I had expected. The screenplay is absolute and there is a surprise for you as Franco rolls into the fairy land. Amazing cinematography & editing. Direction is, of course, brilliant! As a whole, Oz is an amusing watch which talks about evil & good and we know who wins, yeah!Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

51,The-Sarkologist,Wicked was a much better backstory,3,19 November 2013,"As I suspected this movie seems to be a response to the recent Broadway Musical Wicked. Like Wicked it deals with the events in the land of Oz prior to the arrival of Dorothy, but where Wicked attempts to paint the Wicked Witch of the West into a different light, this film turns the concept back to the original idea where the Wicked Witches are both evil and Glenda has once again be cast in the roll of the good witch.However, I should not suggest that the Wicked Witch starts off evil, but rather she is manipulated by her sister to eat an apple which transforms her into the form that we know and love from the Wizard of Oz. This film creates a background, and explains a number of things that come out of the original, however it appears to me as a means to shift the background back to what Baum had originally intended his story to be.This film follows the Wizard of Oz from where he is a failed stage magician to becoming the king of the land of Oz. In fact Oz is the protagonist of the film, though when he first arrives we a brought into a land that is both familiar, but strange. First of all we do not know who the antagonists are, and it is only as we follow Oz in his explorations that we come to discover the truth of what is going on.Personally, I really did not like this movie. The acting was substandard, and parts of the film where just plain boring. The character interaction did not work all that well, and the only character that seemed to have any depth was Oz himself. The flying monkey that seems to follow him around is painfully annoying, and the porcelain girl is tolerable, but a bit too soppy.All in all a below average film where the only reason that I watched it was because I suspected that its intention was to rewrite the background to the Wizard of Oz that had been hijacked by Gregory Maguire (though I thought Maguire's take on the Wizard of Oz was brilliant).",Oz the Great and Powerful

53,Floated2,Better than Expected,8,22 February 2017,"Oz the Great and Powerful is of course a classic remade tale of the Wizard of Oz films. Since Warner Brothers owns the rights to The Wizard of Oz, there was a complicated tap dance that had to take place in order for this new film to be inspired by the books but not serve as a direct prequel to the 1939 film.Within the film, the audience can already notice and imagine how fantastic the world and characters are in the original Oz books, this however is the perfect time to make a movie like this. With the use of technology in these days, the film captures what the classic film tales are meant to be,James Franco stars as Oz, a Midwestern sideshow magician named Oz who is swept away in a Kansas tornado, transporting him to the magical land of Oz. There within a few minutes later, he meets Theodora (Mila Kunis), a witch who informs Oz of a prophecy that he would one day come to liberate the land. Oz also meets Theodora's conniving sister Evanora (Rachel Weisz), whose wicked ways threaten the whole countryside. As the film passes, we are noticed a shift in tone and that the people Oz thought were good, were after the ones who are evil. Later on, Oz meets with Glinda (Michelle Williams), whom he realizes what matters most.Oz the Great and Powerful has received mixed reviews, but within one thing is the visuals and overall cinematography is stunning, and easily one of the main aspects which makes this film passable and entertaining in every sense. Many have critique James Franco as the title character, though he plays the character great and shows his charisma. As a running time of over two hours, the film keeps audiences on their feet and does not stray from what is important. It does drag on and is pretty entertaining throughout. Well done.",Oz the Great and Powerful
54,filipemanuelneto,"Oz has lost much of its magic in a film that, despite this, is still good.",6,27 June 2016,"This film, conceived as a prequel to the famous ""The Wizard of Oz"", 1939, shows us how the ""sorcerer"" goes to that fantastic land, and how he managed to become the greatest sorcerer in the country. Directed by Sam Raimi, this film has a script by Mitchell Kapner and David Lindsay-Abaire. The cast is headed by James Franco, Mila Kunis, Rachel Weisz and Michelle Williams.This prequel was made almost a hundred years after the original film, probably due to the status of ""classic"" that it won through the decades. And the idea to revive Oz, decades after Dorothy's journey through the big screen, is quite good.The script is interesting and the story isn't bad, unrolling quite naturally from the moment the magic arrives in Oz. The biggest problem is that this film completely breaks with its '39 predecessor in a key point of the story: everything that Dorothy does in Oz never happened, it was just a dream but, in this film, the magic really goes to Oz, awake and aware, and the film never explains how. This would never be a problem if the rest of the film wasn't an attempt to prequel the first film but, if it's a prequel and Oz was a dream in the first one, it should have remained a dream in this film or, at least, the arrival of the magic should have been better explained.The actors generally fulfilled reasonably with their work. Rachel Weisz was excellent in the role of Evanora, and her British charm gave to the character an additional dose of calculism and cruelty that was very welcome. Michelle Williams also didn't disappoint as Glinda, managing to personify the qualities of her character. Mila Kunis is very good to roles with personality and great presence, but this isn't the case of Theodora, a woman highly influenced by her bad sister and suffering because of their impulses and passions. Perhaps this has posed problems for the actress, and the way she sought to overcome them has not been the best. The fact is that her character, initially too warm and bland, just improves when becomes a villain. James Franco was an extremely seductive and charming magician, but also opportunistic, hypocritical and more concerned with saving his own skin than helping others. The way he changes was well achieved by the actor, but his performance was generally irregular, with very good scenes followed by other totally uninteresting.The production gave the biggest attention to the sets and visual effects. Raimi knew that the public would require a re-creation, with current techniques, of the colorful and fantastic universe of Oz, and the computerized effects would be essential to achieve that. The result is excellent and worthy of being admired. The photography also helped a lot, and we must emphasize especially the way it helps to mark the ""border"" to the world of Oz, with a gradual change of color and screen format. The special effects were also made with great detail. The soundtrack, however, is absolutely disappointing. The music was an essential part of the first film, which had great musical moments, and there isn't a single decent musical moment in this film, and the main theme are too regular to be worthy of any positive mention.",Oz the Great and Powerful
55,leonblackwood,James Franco was a bad choice. 4/10,4,8 July 2013,"Review: I was expecting this movie to be terrible, judging by the critics reviews, but I quite enjoyed it. The CGI is spectacular but the storyline was a bit silly. The major thing that made the film now as good as it should have been, was the directors choice of going with James Franco who really wasn't convincing enough in his role. All of the other actors put in good performances, but James Franco's acting style didn't suit the role as the wannabe wizard. It does start of well but when he reaches Oz, it just doesn't work. You can't fault the look of the movie which should definitely be up for an award early next year. Average!Round-Up: James Franco is one of those actors were when it works, it really does work, but when it's bad, it is really bad. Johnny Depp would have been perfect for this role, but its Franco's cheesy grin and patronising way of talking throughout the movie which was off putting. The 2 witches (Rachel Weisz & Mila Kunis) worked well together alongside Michelle Williams, who plays sweet very well, and I liked the monkey. It's such a shame that the leading actor let the movie down.Budget: $215million (Bloody Hell!)

58,Vartiainen,A bitter disappointment,2,9 August 2013,"Truth be told, I wasn't expecting much from this film. It seemed like a lazy effort to cash in on the fame of the original 1939 Wizard of Oz. Sure the trailers looked pretty and colourful, but I never saw anything in them that would have caught my interest. And yet, I found myself sitting in the theater, watching this borefest. I wasn't happily surprised, quite the opposite in fact.To the film's credit, it looks very good. The colours of Oz are vibrant and extremely nice to look at, managing to recreate the feel of the 1939 film admirably. Sometimes the screen seemed a bit busy, too much stuff going on at once, but it managed to keep its balance most of the time. The sepia colours of the beginning are also nice to look at and create a nice contrast to the rest of the film.Furthermore, some of the special effects are really quite nice and I guess that the music could have been a lot worse. It's a nice film to experience on a sensuous level, that cannot be doubted. If only the rest of the film could have been up to the task at hand.In my opinion, the worst disappointments are the characters. Only a few of them are in any way likable (here's looking at you China Girl), while the rest of them are either unlikable jerks (the protagonist, the wicked witches, the monkey), naive idiots (the good witches) or just kind of boring (the rest of them). And while being a jerk or just boring could be forgotten on a case by case basis, it's hard to get pulled into the film when your main character causes you to want to kick his ass. He gets a bit better towards the end, the usual jerk with a heart of gold storyline if you will, but even those story lines need the main character to be at least somewhat sympathetic right from the start.And then there's the plot, which isn't all that interesting either. Guy gets pulled into the Land of Oz, there's a turmoil going on, something needs to be done, hesitation, confusion, mixed feelings, some inspirational speeches, a ""clever"" plan is hatched and they all lived happily ever after. The End....Boring. Nothing new is introduced into the formula, the characters are not interesting enough for us to care about them and even the pacing is somewhat off or rather it feels too controlled. I could see the different scenes coming way too easily, like the movie was counting down seconds to the next scene change.Still, it isn't the dumbest movie I've ever seen. It's uninspired, feels rushed and the only thing good about it is the way it looks. Plus the character of China Girl, who was adorable. If you have to see it, go ahead, it's passable. If you have a choice, do see something else.",Oz the Great and Powerful

But when a tornado comes to Kansan's Oz ends up getting trapped while he was in his hot air balloon and he is whisked to the colorful enchanting world of Oz where anything possible can happen. While his there he meets a young beautiful girl called Theodora(played by Kunis) who tells him that she is a witch(could she be the wicked green faced witch perhaps?? well you have to find out in the movie)and he teams up with her for a while. He later meets a talking monkey(again voiced by Braff as he played Oz's friend in Kansas) and he later meets Theodora's sister played by Rachel Weisz(who is a villain in this movie).So as Oz pretends to be a wizard will his true identity be revealed to the new world?So what did I like about this film well for starters the changing aspect from black and white to colour is brilliant part of me was like watching a Tim Burton production rather than a Sam Rami flick.Also again like a Tim Burton flick the backgrounds are gorgeous to look at and the acting is actually not that bad. The make up effects for Kunis and Weisz was really good especially near the end where it is revealed that one of them is a wicked witch and the other is an ugly witch too.James Franco was also good in this movie. The movie does however drag as its on for 130 mins. But if your in for a good fantasy movie that will have your brain switched off than be my guest and check it out also I liked the Mariah Carey song Almost Home which can be heard at the ending credits.Overall im giving this a 7.",Oz the Great and Powerful
61,Turfseer,No magic here in this lame 'prequel' to 1939 Classic,2,9 November 2013,"When Disney executives saw the finished product of 'Oz the Great and Powerful', a prequel to the erstwhile favorite, 'The Wizard of Oz', do you believe they began moaning at the thought of just how bad everything turned out? Or do you believe they were in denial about the weakness of the script, put on their happy faces, and declared that this was a masterpiece? I believe they weren't concerned with the answers to either of these questions. Disney executives are not stupid. They knew with some halfway decent digital effects and enough references to the 1939 classic, even an extremely mediocre script, would not sink them at the box office. And right they were! The new 'Oz' was a big success and they made gobs of cash.The new Oz reboot starts out in black and white just like the original. That's where all comparisons end. You can tell right from this opening sequence, that the magic just isn't there. Instead of 'Dorothy' and Judy Garland, we end up with the traveling circus huckster, Oscar 'Oz' Diggs, played by a miscast James Franco. Whereas the original had a compelling story about a cold hearted spinster who, under the guise of legality, expropriates a dog belonging to a heartbroken child, here, the protagonist's flirtation with the wife of a circus strong man, propels the protagonist into the dark, second act, fantasy world. While depicting the wizard as a womanizer may not kill sympathy for the character, the way in which Oz treats his subordinate, certainly does. Instead of a charming rake, Franco's 'Oz' is both part bumbler and arrogant materialist.Oscar's entrance into the world of Oz, incorporates the vehicle of the hot air balloon, so prominent in the denouement of the original. Here, in one of the many nods to the original Oz, Oscar is sucked into a tornado and ends up in a new 'Technicolor' universe. But it's way more than just the Technicolor of the original—director Rami's 'Oz' is an art deco wonderland, reminiscent of the digital effects in 'Avatar', featuring giant flowers and butterflies. Instead of a house landing on a wicked witch, Oscar's hot air balloon cascades down a waterfall, with Oscar miraculously surviving a near fatal plunge. While the digital effects are pleasing to the eye, once we meet the first character in the Land of Oz, everything is downhill from there. In the original film, Glinda the Good Witch was pitted against her sister, the Wicked Witch of the West. In this version, there are three witches: Theodora (Mila Kunis), her evil sister, Evanora (Rachel Weisz), and Glinda the Good Witch, played by Michelle Williams. At the beginning of the second Act, Kunis walks around with Franco with a completely clueless look on her face, as if she has no idea how to play the character. Feminists are sure to be appalled, as both Theodora and Glinda are doe-eyed for Oscar throughout the narrative (Theodora mistaking him for a wizard and Glinda admitting that she knows he's not the Wizard, but still can help defeat the Wicked Witch).Only later, when Evanora convinces her to take a bite of an apple, does Kunis morph into the more familiar evil, green-skinned wicked witch, and camps things up the rest of the way, battling Oscar and his minions (Weisz probably does the best acting of the three witches but her Evanora, is an unmemorable, undistinguished part). It might have been a better idea if Theodora and Evanora, were one character. Williams as Glinda is one-note throughout the film, echoing Theodora's earlier hero worship.In place of the dynamic sidekicks, Scarecrow, Tin Man and Lion, Oscar must be content with two allies who miss the mark: Finley, a witless flying monkey and the China Girl, a porcelain figure who Oscar mends with a bottle of glue. Oscar's act of kindness in healing the China Girl, might be good for young kids but the 'glue' scene goes on interminably too long for adults. The porcelain girl bonds with Oscar on a childlike level and ends up helping Glinda free herself from the bad witches, after she's captured and put in chains in Emerald City. Glinda in turn, neutralizes Evanora, by destroying her emerald necklace, and reducing her to an old crone.Unlike the original, where the Scarecrow, Lion and Tin Man, courageously attempt to save Dorothy by entering the Wicked Witch's lair and actually killing her, we now have the politically correct solution: Oscar assists the pacifist denizens of Oz, who don't believe in violence, by concocting a series of 'sleight of hand' magic tricks, to take back Emerald City (with an approaching World War, the 1939 scenarists apparently refused to view the world with rose-colored glasses). Evanora's army of flying baboons, are tricked into entering the poppy seed field where they fall asleep after being lured by mechanical scarecrows, constructed by Oz craftsmen (another nod in the long line of nods to the classic Oz). The powerful Theodora, proves not to be powerful at all—fleeing the city after being freaked out by Oscar's holographic projection of himself as a malevolent and powerful wizard. Oscar's transformation from arrogant con man to humanitarian, is not explained very well. What's worse is the unconvincing way in which he defeats the two seemingly powerful wicked witches (they just can't seem to realize that there's no true force behind his bag of magic tricks). In the end, we never become invested in Oscar's journey as we are in Dorothy's. When Dorothy exclaims, ""I'm scared, Auntie Em, I'm scared"", we believe it! That's because the personification of the evil she faces (in the form of the Wicked Witch) appears real. Not so for Disney's two ineffectual wicked witches and the syrupy, sentimental allies, who assist Oscar, in his quest to restore the land of Oz, to a rightful, balanced equilibrium.",Oz the Great and Powerful
62,DarkVulcan29,Not all great or powerful,6,13 March 2013,"A prequel to The Wizard of Oz(1939)was not a bad idea, that film from that decade was a timeless classic. And telling the origins on how Oz(James Franco) became The Wizard of Oz seemed interesting.Now the effects are incredible and dazzling. And the sets are beyond terrific, it has believing that you are in the land of oz. The effects and sets are just as imaginative as it was in 1939.But the performances of James Franco and Michelle Williams is what brings this movie down for me. They are both good actors, but Franco and Williams are sleep walking through this, I mean they look super bored being in this, so does the rest of the cast, except for Rachel Weisz and Milla Kunis, are the only two putting in effort in there roles.it's also badly paced, and I never thought I'd say about a Sam Raimi film, who's films are usually well paced. See it for the effects, but that is it.",Oz the Great and Powerful
63,freemantle_uk,An enjoyable and solid family fantasy,7,14 March 2013,"L. Frank Baum's Oz series is one of the beloved series in children's literature and lead to one of the most popular family films ever, The Wicked of Oz. There have been many projects since the 1939 based on the Oz property, from a pseudo-sequel Return to Oz and the novel Wicked which has turned into a hit musical. Now Disney and Sam Raimi have made their own prequel to the Wizard of Oz after the Billion Dollar success of Alice in Wonderland.In 1905 Oscar Diggs (James Franco) is a stage magician known as Oz, The Great and Powerful, for a travelling circus in the Midwest. He seduces naïve country girls using a rehearsal story and a music box and the woman he loves, Annie (Michelle Williams) is engaged in a marrying another man. But when he is running away from the circus strong man Oz ends up in a hot air balloon and when he gets stuck in a tornado ends up getting transported to Oz.When in Oz our hero finds out from Theodora the Good Witch (Mila Kunis) of a prophecy that a man with the same name as the land is a great wizard who will save the world from the Wicked Witch. He takes up the task because of the promise of Oz would have access to the riches of the land. Partnered with a flying monkey, Finley (Zack Braff) and a girl made from china (Joey King) who has lost her family. But they soon learn the truth from Glinda the Good Witch of the South (also Williams).Oz: The Great and Powerful is a fantastic looking film with great special effects. I admit I would have preferred to have seem more practical effects and sets and some of the blue screen effects looked a little too layered, but on the whole the CGI was incredible and when first ever Oz it felt very similar to Pandora in Avatar and The Inbetween in The Lovely Bones. There was some incredible visuals, such as the tree's leafs the turn into birds, the jewel flowers and the mountains that look like animals. The China Girl was also an great creation as you got to see all every crack and every little detail and heard every sound when she moved.Sam Raimi was able to assumable a great cast for Oz: The Great and Powerful. The highlights were Williams, Rachel Weisz and King. Williams was a real coup for the film and she does really bring to life the embodiment of goodness and made what could have been a dull character interesting. Weisz relished her role as the villain and King has improved a lot as a child actress, partly because she had much more to do then in her previous roles. Braff was good as the comic relief character and Franco was fine when he played the role straight. But Kunis was a bit stiff in her role which is a shame considering her good work in Black Swan and Ted.For fans of the 1939 film there are some fun little references to that film and the original novels and author. The journey Oz takes also has a similar route to one Dorothy took as he meets his partners, saving one of them, healing another and a bit misunderstanding of the third. Added to that the partners are also people in the our world.Raimi does make a great look film and he brings his visual style to the film. There are moments that felt like Raimi film, particular his Spider-man films, whilst still homaging his horror routes. This was particularly the case when we see the origins of the Wicked Witch of the West. The tone is light mostly, but there are still some dark moments, like seeing the aftermath of the attack on China Town. The pacing was right for the film and it never dragged despite the long running time Oz: The Great and Powerful is a solidly enjoyable family film and it is refreshing to see a fantasy film that is not chasing the PG-13 rating to make the film more marketable or go down the 'dark and gritty' route. Good comparisons and recommendations would be with The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, Stardust and the Narnia, for tonal, thematic and visual reasons. However Oz: The Great and Powerful was too reliance on using humour to keep the light tone when playing it straight would been a better fit.",Oz the Great and Powerful
64,strong-122-478885,Oz!? Great!? Powerful!? Ha! Ha! Think Again!!,1,19 March 2014,"Well, I know one thing for certain - Hollywood sure knows how to wreck an all-time classic tale of fantasy & adventure and literally reduce it to being nothing but an utter mess of forgettable redundancy, as well as being a hideous eyesore of gaudy CGI effects.Oz (!?) - The Great (!?) - The Powerful (!?) - Ha! That's a good one! I'd say that this film's title was everything that its story wasn't, and then some.In the original Wizard of Oz, Dorothy Gale's experience in the Land of Oz was revealed to be a dream, while here, Oscar Diggs' trip over the rainbow was apparently for real. (Duh!) (You can bet that there was no waking up back in Kansas for Diggs.... Nor would there be any - ""Oh, Auntie Em! There's no place like home!"" for Diggs, either) Besides the fact that this film's story didn't contain even an ounce of magical charm, I also couldn't tolerate the unbearably annoying voice-over narration that dominated throughout. This continually irksome blow-by-blow account of the action (courtesy of the narrator) was at least 10x worse than was the idiotic narration in frickin' Blade Runner.This was the sort of film where if you were to fast-forward it all the way through, you honestly wouldn't miss anything worthwhile.On top of this film being plagued to the absolute rafters with flaws and plot-holes galore, it also totally p-i-s-s-e-d me off that I had to tolerate not one, not two, but all three of the witches as being nothing but pretty, little ""Barbie doll"" bimbos. (Spare me!) And when that dizzy dunce Theodora actually fell for her wicked sister's ""take-a-bite-of-this-green-poison-apple"" trick, that was yet another straw that broke this ""white elephant's"" back, for sure.And speaking about breaking this white elephant's back (for about the umpteenth time) - When Oscar Diggs (aka. Oz) actually went ahead and blatantly seduced the naively virginal, good witch, Glinda, during the story's final scene (while his 3 giggling sidekicks looked on) - Well, I'd say that that atrocity just about scraped the very bottom of the barrel for being one of the most despicable ""fairy tale"" moments ever recored on film.In one way I view this film's story as clearly being something of a political metaphor. It certainly showed me just how gullible and deliberately ignorant people can be when it comes to choosing a leader (be it a wizard, or a president, or whatever).I mean, Oscar Diggs literally fell out of the sky from nowhere. And no one in the Land of Oz knew a damn thing about him.And even though Diggs was a womanizer (even of witches) and a fraud. And even though he actually came right out, publicly, and told one and all that he was nothing but a con man, the starry-eyed citizens of the Emerald City chose to ignore these glaring red-light warnings and blindly and unanimously vote him right into power. (Sheesh!) And if you were to actually compare this to the reality of political elections in this world of ours today, isn't this exactly the way that a lot of men of dubious character have been handed, on a silver platter, great political power over these years (much to the voters' inevitable regret)? No? Well, hey, it was just a thought!",Oz the Great and Powerful
65,dfranzen70,Visual masterpiece and right in step with original,8,5 March 2013,"Oz the Great and Powerful managed to pull of a trick I didn't think possible - it continued the spirit of its legendary predecessor. It's a flight of fancy marked with darkness and tense, scary situations. It's glorious to watch for the visual effects alone, and director Sam Raimi makes great use of 3D (for a change). The story is as straightforward as it was in 1939, and the characters, although not quite as beloved, are a memorable lot.It's Kansas, 1905, and Oz the Magician works with a traveling circus. He's not the best at his craft, but he makes do. Then a tornado arrives, he jumps into a hot air balloon, and off he goes, hither and yon, thither and whither, arriving in a very odd place. He's met at a river's bank by a beautiful young lady, Theodora (Mila Kunis), who soon discloses she's a witch. (But apparently not a bad one.) Theodora explains that it has been prophesied that a great wizard from a far-off land will arrive and restore the Land of Oz to prosperity, following the death of the king, who, she says, was poisoned by his own daughter, the Wicked Witch.Now, Oz is no wizard. He knows this, but man is that Theodora fetching, so he goes along with it. Then he gets to the palace, where - should he break the Wicked Witch's wand and thus kill her - he'll sit as king of Oz, and he's awed, even more so by the immense riches in the palace's basement. So he happily agrees to undertake the quest, accompanied only by a talking, flying monkey (Zach Braff).The visual effects are stunning. I'm definitely not a fan of 3D, but here Raimi makes ample and appropriate use of the medium. One of Avatar's good points was the feeling of immersion, that objects were floating toward you, not a feeling of depth, with objects in the distance seen as if they were truly in front of you. In Oz the Great and Powerful, 3D is not abused. It pops up when it should, when it makes sense, and that's all you can ask from it. Yes, the movie has munchkins - happily, none committed suicide during filming - and a Horse of a Different Color, if you look closely; mostly, it's a backstory to both our favorite Wicked Witch and Oz himself. It's premise is simple - Oz, a generally selfish con man with a tint of greed to his pallor, finds himself in a situation where he must choose to aid those in need. Or not. He is no wizard, yes, but he is a magician and does possess some, er, tricks up his sleeve. It is possible he is the man the witches are looking for.The cast is game, with Kunis and Williams particular standouts. They're both elegantly clothed (must have been Opposite Day in Witchland) and look positively ethereal, particularly Williams, whom I don't believe I've ever seen look so luminous. In all, Oz the Great and Powerful is a terrific film, probably the first true blockbuster of the year. It maintains the wonder and tone of the '39 megaclassic without messing around with the characters. It serves well as a prequel.",Oz the Great and Powerful
66,PWNYCNY,Superb prequel. Intensely dramatic.,10,22 April 2013,"What a wonderful, beautiful, charming, powerful, compelling, and great movie. This movie is strong in every category - acting, story, special effects and direction. What could have easily been a hokey ripoff of the 1939 classic movie The Wizard of Oz instead is an entirely original work that sets the stage for the actual 1939 movie. Now we know why wicked witch of the west is so angry and ugly; now we know why the wizard has to remain concealed; now we know the true relationship of the wicked witches of the West and North; now we know what Dorothy gets herself into when she arrives in Oz. The cast is excellent. James Franco's performance as the Oz is terrific. He brings a real sense of humanity and warmth to the role. But it is the ladies who keep this movie energized. They are Rachel Weisz, Michelle Williams and last but not least, Mila Kunis. All three are stunning, not only visually but in terms of how they play their roles. Mila Kunis is incredible. She should have been nominated for an Academy Award. Her performance compares favorably to Margaret Hamilton's iconic rendition. Their performances are made even more effective by the fact that they are not campy. That is, they are characters to be taken seriously.

69,estebangonzalez10,Entertaining but not as magical as the 1939 Oz,6,11 March 2013,"¨I don't want to be a good man. I want to be a great one.¨It's no easy task to make a prequel of the successful and timeless 1939 family classic, The Wizard of Oz, but Sam Raimi (director of the Spider Man trilogy and The Evil Dead) was up to the task. Raimi does pay a wonderful homage to some of the iconic images of the classical movie thanks to some great and colorful visual effects, but the story doesn't work as well. It is kind of the same problem I had with Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland where the story doesn't match to the wondrous visuals. I still had a fun time with this film as the nostalgia ended up playing a key role here. The screenplay was co-written by Mitchell Kapner (The Whole 9 Yards) and David Lindsay-Abaire (Rabbit Hole), adapted from L. Frank Baum's novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. Despite not having a great story, it does become suspenseful towards the end and hooked my attention. The opening sequences however were slow and lacked a decent pacing. The visuals end up being a distraction over the impoverished story, but kids will enjoy this film nonetheless. Parents will also be entertained and filled with nostalgia like I was; but it will be inevitable to compare this movie to the classical one, and it does fall short story wise. You still have to take your hat off to Sam Raimi who took the risk and came up with a decent film, but somehow in a cinematic world where we are used to seeing visual spectacles like Hogwarts, Middle Earth, and Narnia you can't carry a film on the visuals alone. You need compelling characters, and unfortunately here the most memorable characters are unlikely ones (a porcelain doll and a winged monkey). The film focuses its attention on Oz, short for Oscar Diggs (James Franco), a circus magician from Kansas who ends up being blown away by a tornado to the wonderful land of Oz. Once he arrives at Oz, he meets a beautiful witch named Theodora (Mila Kunis) who explains how they have been waiting for him because a prophecy claims that a wizard would arrive at Oz and defeat the evil witch who poisoned her own father, the king of Emerald City. The long awaited wizard could become King if he is able to defeat the witch and protect the land. Oz, who isn't a very moral fellow, is interested in becoming great so he accepts as long as he can keep all the gold. He ignores telling her that he isn't actually a real wizard. What Theodora and Oz don't know is that her sister, Evanora (Rachel Weisz), has lied to everyone in Emerald City about the evil witch Glinda (Michelle Williams). Evanora is actually the evil witch who is trying to get rid of Glinda and take over Oz. During his mission Oz runs into some unlikely allies like Finley (Zach Braff) a winged monkey and a porcelain doll named China Girl (Joey King) before discovering the truth about Glinda and Evanora. This is the story of Oz and how he came to this land and made a name for himself. There isn't much greatness about Oz, but the story still works as pure entertainment for the family. There seems to be an underlying silly tone to the whole movie and James Franco knows it and plays along with his role. He doesn't seem to be taking himself too seriously and neither should we. This isn't a classical film, but it does remind us of the magical 1939 film and that alone makes this worth the while. Disney has us used to these clichés about believing in ourselves and achieving our dreams, and Oz is full of them. The film continually reminds us that it could have been much better, but the magic still seems to be present. The best characters are the ones voiced by Zach Braff and Joey King. They have the funniest scenes and make the movie much more enjoyable. Michelle Williams is also a pleasure to watch as the sweet and innocent Glinda. There isn't really much more I can say about this film, if you are a fan of the original film then you might want to see this for pure nostalgic reasons but don't expect it to be as good as that classic movie. It has its moments and overall it is an enjoyable and entertaining movie.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",Oz the Great and Powerful

But here it exist in this sad excuse of a movie.Where to start a review of this trifling & meandering plot line and characterizations is a greater challenge than watching it. There isn't one new idea in this movie; all the costumes and settings and visual tricks have been seen before in other fantasy adventure stories. Think the original Oz, the Grinch, Alice in Wonderland, Alice Through the Looking Glass, etc. The computer graphics are comic book quality and the movie itself comes across as just a special effects compilation festival with a thin-as-a-thread story dumped into it.Truly, not one actor or voice over rises to engage the viewer. The amateurish totally mind numbing script is being recited by bored actors reading their lines and being way too eager to go home and do something with their lives.

72,jfgibson73,Good sequences but doesn't fit together,5,13 July 2013,"I enjoyed this movie because it had a lot of entertaining sequences and characters. The early parts of the movie in Kansas were enjoyable for their period setting, and for the character of Oscar. My problems with the movie started right away, however, because I immediately did not feel like this person was in any way connected with the character we see at the end of the 1939 movie. And that was kind of what bothered me all the way through: I enjoyed a lot of it, but as its own story. None of it felt like the world from the old one. Some things in the movie that I saw in the ads were things I was sure I wouldn't like, such as the flying monkey Finley. But once I saw and heard the character, I couldn't help but enjoy him. He had great lines, and had a very expressive face. My favorite sequence was when the rescued China Girl-- I thought that was executed perfectly. It was an example of how to make you care about a character done to maximum effect, but as soon as she was repaired, she became annoying and didn't serve any purpose. I didn't feel like the witches had any motivation or character arc that I could get into or that made sense to the story, and again, it felt nothing like what they become in the original film. If another movie was made to bridge Oz The Great and Powerful with The Wizard Of Oz, maybe more things would make sense. Or, maybe reading the books would help me understand the bigger story. As it is, I was entertained and enjoyed watching it with my family. We were all drawn in very quickly and it kept us interested. Also, I thought Glinda was very well done. I am becoming a bigger fan of Michelle Williams, and I'm pretty sure she gives the best performance of every movie she's in. The sequence at the end where Oscar tricks the witches was well done, but the fight between Glinda and Rachel Weiss didn't make sense. I'll end the review now.",Oz the Great and Powerful
73,aharmas,Wonderful and Powerful Witches,8,9 March 2013,"For starters, try to forget the 1939 classic when you're watching this. The story deals with events predating Dorothy's arrival to the wonderful land of Oz, and they're very different from the plot events in the musical that has managed to bewitch audiences for the last decades. What we have is a film which contains two marvelous performances by Michelle Williams and Rachael Weisz. James Franco has the thankless role of a man with a dubious character and questionable motives.As Franco arrives in Oz, he discovers he can manipulate some of the welcoming committee; however he is not aware of the real politics and back stories in the magic family he now confronts. As events evolve, he learns to discover that there is more to his character, but this new knowledge comes with exposure to whimsical characters, interaction with a rather alluring and wise beauty and a realization that he is able to create ""magic"" of his own in order to save this charming world and his own self.Williams continues to enchant audiences, this time literally with her powerful charm as the ""good witch"" who must fight the evil sisters and clear her name. She is now in charge of leading the fight, enlist and convince Oscar to lend her support with his particular knowledge/his own special kind of magic. She is a vision, beautiful to see and admire, as she is able to open up the hearts and minds of those around her. She is kind and pure.Weisz is the complete opposite, in a way more than a match for either Glinda or Oscar, and still pretty formidable against both of them. If her own sister wasn't a bit traumatized, they both could be the equivalent of Darth Vader in ""Star Wars"". Unfortunately, the newly transformed Wicked Witch is underdeveloped and not as fascinating as her thoroughly delicious twisted sister. Weisz gives a classic performance and easily joins classic characters as Darth Vader and Hannibal Lecter in the way she approaches the role, with supreme gusto and showing the audience how far you can take a simple and yet, quite meaty role.One of the biggest assets of this film is its production design, the art direction and special effects. There is a definite tribute to the 1939 film in the way the deco period is revived, but it also boasts its original look, a rich, velvety and luxurious recreation of sets that remind of cinema's golden era. The leads all look amazing, and the 3D technology enhances the magic of the story.It's not a perfect film, but it has enough merits of its own, and one hopes there is a sequel so they can improve on a very good effort, and we can continue enjoying the mythology of the wonderful world of Oz.",Oz the Great and Powerful
74,dalydj-918-255175,Visually stuffed trying to create a childhood memory,5,8 March 2013,"""Oz is less interesting then Dorothy in Oz which is the fault of James Franco and Raimi for making this land I have loved since my youth fake with no heart unlike the 1939 family movie classic"" The stories of Oz are told over 14 books and while most people think Dorothy is the only character to visit Oz would be wrong with Oscar Diggs (James Franco) visiting the land first. This movie of Oz is about Oscar who came upon Oz through a twister in his hot air balloon. He is met by the witch Theodora (Mila Kunis) and somehow becomes the the great wizard. While making his way through the land he meets other witches such as Evanora (Rachel Weisz) and Glinda (Michelle Williams), Finley the Flying Monkey (Zack Braff) and China Girl (Joey King). The film is quite bright throughout but becomes the obvious fairytale with a battle ending the film with one changed character due to the motives of the sly Oz.Films about fantasy lands such as Oz have done good jobs at making these unrealistic lands have some realism to them unlike Oz that looks both fake and hard to watch in how the actors stand out on top of the green screen. The film does pay tribute to the the way ""The Wizard of Oz"" opening by presenting us a black and white version of Kanses and while it is good in the 4:3 frame rate it just did not work for me as the way it could have. I did like seeing some actors in both Kanses and Oz just like what was done in the 1939 classic. The world does feel large in scale as we see the origin story of the man behind the curtain. The introduction of the Wicked Witch of the West did not work as well for me as I expected it would because I did not like how she came out through the use of makeup trying to make a pretty girl ugly unlike the iconic performance given by Margaret Hamilton which will never be topped in my mind.James Franco plays the central character of Oz and he never fits the role giving both an uncomfortable and out of place performance that feels fake and is the worst performance in the film which is bad as he is the central character of the film. Mila Kunis plays Theodora/The Wicked Witch of the West and I feel she did not live up to the role even though I did find her appealing as she mad both parts of the character different and while she looks near awful as the wicked witch she at least gives the performance her best but still is not as compelling. Rachel Wesiz plays Evanora/The Wicked With of the East and she seems to have fun with her role although being underused and appearing less on screen. She seemed comfortable in her portrayal. Michelle Williams plays Anna/Glinda the Good Witch and she is the best in the film as she adds a difference to the character of Glinda. She plays the good witch but adds some bite to her to make her both funny at times and entertaining. Zach Braff and Joey King played CGI characters and were fine seeming the most real of all the fake entities in the film.Disappointing attempt by Sam Raimi nearly ruining the movie with too much visionary. Franco and Kunis disappoint and seem not to fit into this time line. Good effects and production at least make the film watchable even though it does seem long and boring at times. Basically the film is for children trying to make young laugh at jokes which never really worked for me.MOVIE GRADE: C- (MVP: Michelle Williams)",Oz the Great and Powerful
75,Samiam3,This was a very bad idea.,3,25 August 2013,"Why is Hollywood so desperate to tell origin stories? Does the Wizard of Oz really need that treatment? Why should the audience care about his origin? After all, he is one of the less likable characters in the classic. He is a liar and a phony, and an unsympathetic human being with no power or magic. It should be no surprise then that Oz the Great and Powerful has no magic either. This is the story of a travelling circus magician in Kansas, nicknamed Oz who ends up in a land that just happens to have that same name. Suddenly the people of the land of Oz believe him to be the wizard who will save them from the tyranny of the wicked witch.What we get is the classic tale of mistaken identity that leaves no cliché unturned. It is chaotic and restless, and offers no breathing room for character development. Instead, all the air is given to over sized computer generated flowers and singing water plants. The entire cast should be ashamed of themselves for this series of non- performances. Nobody in this movie looks involved or committed. James Franco is playing his obnoxious self, and he doesn't even do it well. I wont even begin do describe how unconvincing all the leading ladies are. If I wanted to be nice, I would say they were all subject to casting errors. Mila Kunis as the Wicked Witch (when you think about it) does not even sound right.There are times when the movie is so close to a parody that you'd think it was directed by the Seltzer/Freidberg duo (Epic movie). Most of the script is laughable, but it is not always easy to tell when this is intentionally so. I did like one character's remark about 'yellow brick potholes'. I suppose one could argue the visuals are competent, but I wasn't impressed. Everything in this world is something that we've seen before, and done better. The color temperature is overwhelming and at times causes motion blur and pixelation in the CG. When a world is as fantastical as this, then it bears no resemblance to reality, and you become aware of the need for green screens. In fact, I cannot think of a single moment in the film that looked like it was on location. There was not even a single cloud or piece of yellow brick that didn't look like the product of digitization. This entire production was a mistake; a film that makes its actors look bad, and tells a story that is neither entertaining nor enriching as family entertainment. It only serves to reminds us that the land of Oz is one for the history books. It had its day, and should not have been rejuvenated",Oz the Great and Powerful
76,jadepietro,"Gee Wiz, How Bad Can It Be? Very.",3,14 March 2013,"This film is not recommended.Neither great or powerful is Sam Raimi's modern-day prequel, Oz The Great and Powerful. Nor is it beloved or classic like L. Frank Baum's original novel. Or clever or enchanting like the 1939 MGM film musical. It just is.This new incarnation takes on the facts as we know it and then add some prior details to its new updating. Similar to the boffo Broadway musical, Wicked, this film gives the movie-going audience some prior knowledge to build on and relate to the action on screen. Both efforts never come near the original sources. It's kinda like comfort food for the soul rather than four star dining. Maybe, more like leftovers, on second thought.￼So let's begin our tale where it has begun many times before. It's still Kansas, but the year is 1905. In the film's black and white opening sequence (what else?), we meet Oscar Diggs, (a poorly cast James Franco who plays his character with a wise-ass smirk throughout the entire movie). Diggs is a two-bit sideshow magician and womanizer who mistreats his ladies and also his loyal sidekick, Frank (who will later morph into a bellhop monkey named Finley). Soon it's time to move on. Untether that hot air balloon. One windbag will arrive in Oz, not counting the principal means of transportation. Bring on that cyclone! And off we go...￼Once we land in this Technicolor fantasy world, we meet the fetching trio of witches, in order of believability: Evanora (Rachel Weisz), Theodora (Milas Kunis), and Glinda (Michelle Williams), but only one of these beauties will become that Wicked Witch of the West who terrorized us all as children. (The filmmakers add an air of mystery as to that identity thief, but it becomes no surprise as the suspect is apparent midway through the film.)Also along for the ride is the aforementioned Finley (nicely voiced by Zach Braff) and other fond recollections of the endearing movie of yore: the Munchkins, the Emerald City, the Winged Monkeys, the Yellow Brick Road, etc. But in this version, there are no ruby slippers (trademark infringement prevented that image). No Scarecrow, Tin Man, or Cowardly Lion on hand either. No Dorothy Gale and her little dog, Toto. All that will come later. But what about now?Instead, this revisionist tale has an excess of CGI to hold our interest, almost making the film look like a live action cartoon. ( The sets look artificial and flat; the costumes are unimaginative and gaudy.) Some of the visual effects are eye-popping and gorgeous to behold. (Especially strong are the China Doll character, those scarier-than-before flying primates which will haunt a new generation of youngsters, and a nifty floating bubble sequence.) But most of the other visuals are rather ho-hum and a bit garish. (The Tim Burton inspired fairy rip-offs and a phony looking twister come to mind.) Raimi is a competent director who knows how to stage his shots and keep his film interesting with his unique vision intact. What he is unable to do is create a film with well-drawn characters that are credible or at least engaging and a plot that has any real direction. He has made a film that's loud, shallow, and charmless, as pretty as a big festooned float on parade. Unfortunately, this time, the parade has passed them all by.The actors rarely rise to the occasion. Franco is a major disappointment. The actor plays this fraud of a wizard as a second class performer, but that just might be method acting on display after all, conning the movie-going public at large. Franco's interpretation of the role plays more like The Wizard of Odd. It is a strange and unappealing performance that never makes comes together. The talented Ms. Weisz tries to bring some nuance to her conflicted character, but Ms. Kunis and Ms. Williams are merely objects of beauty, decorated to the nines. Yes, the entire cast is all dressed up with nowhere to go. The film's mantra of all style and no substance is a meager reward at best.Oz The Great and Powerful is still in search of a brain. Its script by Mitchell Kapner and David Lindsay-Abaire is banal and oddly dull, except for a few humorous comments scattered throughout this long movie. Sadly, the film doesn't have enough courage either to overcompensate for its lack of ideas and its own limitations. It sticks too closely to the original predecessor's outline as if to gain some success through association. But, most importantly, and this is the film's biggest flaw, Oz The Great and Powerful simply has no heart. GRADE: C-ANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com to add any comments.NOTE: The film does boast a lovely opening credits sequence. With a glorious black and white pop-up staging as its inspiration, the opening credits display a wonderful use of depth and dimension. Its old fashioned theatrics approach, reminiscent of 19th century engravings with a mix of Edward Gory details, create a highly imaginative beginning and are one of the few highlights in this disappointing and dim-witted film. Believe me, it's all downhill from there. ( And I might add, the 3-D effects are not worth the additional price of admission either.)",Oz the Great and Powerful
77,Sherazade,Good not great,7,10 April 2014,"Michelle Williams was a marvel to watch as Glenda the good, she certainly has come a long way since 'Dawson's Creek' and Rachel Weisz after winning her Oscar for 'The Constant Gardener' seems to be phoning in ever other performance after that. She gave us sub-standard Rachel in her delightfully wicked turn. The true scene-stealer with something to prove here was Mila Kunis and she delivered big time because she certainly made me want to see her in everything else she has to offer after this. James Franco who has a lot to apologise for after that terrible turn in 'Your Highness' just barely skims through as the titular character, he seemed drunk in most scenes and disinterested or bored in most others but then again anyone with half a brain their head wouldn't bother to compete with the cinematographic brilliance that this film is, the true star is/are the achievements visual effects, costuming and makeup and if ever there was a film to see in 3D, this one certainly should be high on that list. High on entertainment content and visual spectacle but low on any other real content, I give it a 7/10.",Oz the Great and Powerful
78,richard-1787,"An unremarkable movie, alas",6,8 March 2013,"Because, after having seen ""The Wizard of Oz"" countless times over the last 50+ years, I was indeed afraid that this movie ""would somehow taint the glorious original, or make us cringe at its lack of wonderful wizardry,"" I waited until I read Clint O'Connor's review in the Cleveland Plain Dealer before going to see it this afternoon. He gave it a green light, so I went. I'm not sorry that I did so, but unlike TWOZ, I doubt I will ever watch this movie a second time. The best part of the movie, for me, was the end: the very theatrical finale when Oz pulls out his best tricks and defeats the powers of evil with his own sort of magic. That was fun. But too often, the movie seemed weak to me. Not because it was ""not as good as"" TWOZ. Most of the movies that have been made since 1939 are not as good as TWOZ, but that doesn't mean that there haven't been good ones. Instead, for me, there were several major weaknesses. First, the actor chosen to create Oz, James Franco, didn't have what it takes. Yes, he's charming, in a sort of boyish way that might appeal to adolescent girls. But his voice does nothing, which became very apparent in the finale, where it couldn't conjure any effects when effects were needed. Just being handsome is NOT enough, folks. An actor needs to have a great, schooled voice, and Mr. Franco doesn't have that. A modern equivalent of Erol Flynn is what this part required, and Mr. Franco is not that. Second, the ""sidekicks"" added virtually nothing to this movie. Clint O'Connor writes that ""the best part is the funny give and take between Oz and his two closest companions: Finley (voice of Zach Braff), a talking winged monkey in a bellhop suit; and China Girl."" I can't agree with him. Neither of the characters was developed at all, and that was a problem. In TWOZ the sidekicks were played by human actors, with the wonderful results that everyone remembers. But other Disney animated films have shown that animated sidekicks can also come to life, if given a good script and great voices. The script in this movie was weak, especially when it came to developing the flying monkey and the china doll, and the actors who voiced them did nothing to make those two characters come alive. In general, this movie was short on humor and too long on uninspired script. The three witches were fine, but the one who played Glenda did not convey the sort of ethereal beauty that Billy Burke somehow managed to convey in TWOZ. Not a bad movie, then, but not one that is likely to stick in my memory.",Oz the Great and Powerful

80,Matt_Layden,From The Evil Dead to Disney....,7,10 March 2013,"A magician finds himself transported to the magical land of Oz, where witches, flying monkeys and yellow brick roads exist. He is mistaken for the saviour of Oz and must decide whether or not to stay and be king, or leave and find his way home.I love Sam Raimi, the man and his invented work with a camera are what made me want to get into filmmaking in the first place. So to see him handling big projects like this (and Spiderman) was a joy for me to see. Oz the Great & Powerful is a CGI heavy film that demands a creative eye behind the lens. After his work on big budget films like Spiderman, it seemed like an easy choice for Raimi to be the one behind Oz and for the most part, it works. The films shortcomings keep it from being really magical and memorable, like the original from 39, but Oz has enough whimsy to keep the kids entertained and the adults smiling. The land of Oz is indeed magical, with vibrant colours around every corner, memorable spots like the poppy fields and the dark forest for us older viewers, but even in saying all that I can't help but feel how fake it all is. This film suffers from the same troubles that plagued Burton's Alice in Wonderland, the visuals, although great for the story, add no sense of realism to the image. I hate overly used CGI in films to the point of noticing the awkward placement of actors in front of the green screen. The first major offender of this is Star Wars: Attack of the Clones, none of the actors made me believe they were in the settings they were. Both Wonderland and Oz have this same feeling. While I'm getting the negatives out of the way, I must say that what everyone is saying about Mila Kunis is true, she was miscast in this role. I think she was chosen more for her beauty and star power than her acting abilities, which is sad cause it looks like she really is trying here. The story for her character here is a sad one and the second half I think suffers a bit because the threat from her is not really present. I don't really know why I'm tip-toeing around the issue because those who know The Wizard of Oz, know that Dorothy kills one witch with her house and the other with water, leaving Glinda the good witch in a bubble as the saviour. Seeing the Kunis character go in the direction she does didn't really effect me as much as I wanted it to. Consider that the failure of the script more so than the actors. Not enough time is really given to her for her transformation to affect the viewer.The film opens in black & white and and the transformation to colour had a smile on my face. Despite the ""fakeness"" of some of the scenes (not all) Raimi does a decent job of not letting the effects overpower the film. Raimi steers the film in the right direction, but it is James Franco's shoulders it has to rest on. He is the type of actor that comes off as not really caring. It works in some films like Pineapple Express and he does manage to turn in some great performances, look at 127 days or Freaks & Geeks for that. Unfortunately I don't know if he has enough charisma and power to command a film like this. At times it looked like he was in the role, other times it felt like he couldn't care. Maybe it's his acting style, I can't really put my finger on it, but clearly Raimi sees something in him because he has worked with him previously on the Spiderman films. Where the acting does work, marvellously and in every scene is Rachel Weisz and Michelle Williams. Two polar opposites that look like they actually enjoy the characters and the movie they are in. They elevate the material a bit to make the drama more tangible. Whereas without them I think the film would have fallen more flat. The drama and character choices didn't really bring me into the story. The film didn't feel like it took chances, or tried to have complex situations for the characters. It had mapped out beats, hit them and marched on. It was nice seeing some nice Raimi touches in the final product. More than 25 years later and I still smile when I see Bruce Campbell getting hit in the face, knowing full well that it is Sam Raimi on the other end of the camera hitting him. Surprisingly, moments did indeed feel Evil Deadish to me, with the flying witches holding out their hands in a deadite possession form. But I digress. Oz is a good film, with weaknesses that bring it down. Raimi and two witches try their best to elevate some bland material and in the end we are left with a film that is neither great, nor memorable....just satisfactory enough.",Oz the Great and Powerful
81,pc95,Semi-Interesting but Should've Left This Alone,6,21 June 2013,"(spoilers) Writers, producers, and directors need to leave classics alone - especially ""The Wizard of Oz"". Back in the 80s, granted a much more contemptible ""effort"" in the form of a sequel, ""Return to Oz"" with thrown together. Sam Raimi's latest Grand-Cousin, ""Oz, the Great and Powerful"" which employs writing credits from no less than 4 screen- writers is a better try, but often tacky, like spitting on hallowed ground. Is this film a ""bad"" movie? Maybe not completely taken as itself, but it's inherently plundering from a by-gone era classic. Trying to take it on it's own even though, James Franco doesn't fly as the Wizard and neither does Mila Kunis, one of the witches. She laughably snorts and screams in incredible-hulk green sounding like a 7- year old having temper tantrum. Franco is much too informal and lacks the showmanship for believability for even small-time magician. So those 2 mis-casts sunk the movie for me by themselves. I know it's easier to grub off other projects since originality is difficult to come by, but unfortunately these kinds of movies will continue to be made as long as people pay to watch them in the theater. Not a turkey of a movie, but can't really recommend either. Stick to the original. About a 5.75/10",Oz the Great and Powerful
82,moviexclusive,"Both lovingly referential and delightfully imaginative, this is a vivid, colourful and enchanting tale of whimsy and wonderment",8,4 March 2013,"To attempt a follow-up to a beloved classic such as 'The Wizard of Oz' would seem entirely foolhardy; yet there is sheer magic in Sam Raimi's 'Oz: The Great and Powerful', an always engaging, consistently entertaining and utterly bewitching fairy tale fable that elegantly evokes the 1939 classic while being entirely in tune with the sensibilities of modern-day audiences. As clear reverence to that legendary picture, it opens in black-and- white and framed in Academy ratio with the traveling magician Oscar Diggs (James Franco) at the Baum Family Circus in 1905 Kansas. It's no secret that Oscar will eventually become the Wizard; all that matters is how he gets there, and what follows is a beautiful journey imagined by screenwriters Mitchell Kapner and David Lindsay-Abaire of how an ordinary man can become a great man with a good heart and a little bit of faith.As such tales do, this one starts with who Oscar isn't – and that is, an honest and reliable person. No doubt as a magician, Oscar will always have a trick up his sleeve; but Oscar hasn't simply been hoodwinking his audience. Instead, the smooth talker has also been fooling any beautiful lady whom he meets; even as one such lady (Michelle Williams) hopes to persuade him in his trailer to marry her, the relative of another broken-hearted woman gives furious chase, forcing him to climb into his hot-air balloon for escape.That is the first of many narrative sleight-of-hands in which fans will immediately recall Victor Fleming's original. Here, a giant tornado whisks him right into its eye, where he watches with wide-eyed horror as every manner of debris flies dangerously around him. Once again taking a cue from the original, this sequence is filmed for maximum thrills – especially so with an added dimension – with an exhilarating ride down a gushing waterfall added in for good measure. As Dorothy was in 'The Wizard of Oz', Oscar is greeted by a kind and beautiful witch, Theodora (Mila Kunis), who is immediately spellbound by the possibility that he could very well be the great and wonderful wizard that an ancient prophecy had foretold. Those familiar with the tale will recall that Theodora is but one of the witches of Oz; besides her, there is her sister Evanora (Rachel Weisz) as well as the supposed evil one called Glinda (Williams again) whom Evanora accuses of murdering her father. The fates of these pivotal witches of Oz is intertwined closely with Oscar's transformation from an opportunistic and self-centred trickster to a revered hero of the people of Oz, and like Dorothy, Oscar is joined on his adventure by two unlikely companions – a flying monkey (Zach Braff) and an all-porcelain China Girl (Joey King). Along the way, fans of both Baum's novels as well as the original will recognise the other cleverly placed narrative sleights – including flying baboons, singing and dancing Munchkins, poisonous-scented poppy fields, and floating magic bubbles. Yet at no point do these plentiful references ever feel slavish; rather, building on a solid foundation from Kapner and Abaire, Raimi creates a visually resplendent world wowing in its lovingly rendered details that feels fresh and original. The effect is, we dare say, just as magical as that audiences in the past were transported on when Fleming's Technicolour visual effects fantasy was first unveiled, and perhaps even more so with the wonder of today's CGI advances put to work.There is of course much more than just visual bombast on display; in fact, Raimi uses these in service of a story that is full of heart and nerve. Cast as an unprepared man whom destiny calls to greatness, the Wizard is a surprisingly poignant character study of a flawed hero who eventually finds it within himself to rise above himself. That change of heart is portrayed in a befittingly heart-stopping climax engineered on illusion and ingenuity, a grand magic show set right in the heart of Emerald City that again brings to mind the revelation at the end of 'The Wizard of Oz' of the Wizard's identity. If there is one blemish to an otherwise outstanding accomplishment, it is James Franco's casting as the Wizard. While he does bring a slippery charm to the Wizard, he lacks the dramatic stature necessary to make the character a more compelling one. Among the three witches, it is Williams and Weisz who steal the show, the former's radiant goodness a perfect complement against the latter's icy malevolence. And though we do not see him after the film's extended prologue, Braff's voice-over for the Wizard's winged companion brings much spirited humour to the proceedings.So like 'The Wizard of Oz', this prequel is good old-fashioned family entertainment. And just because this comes late in Hollywood's recent obsession with fairy tales should not at all deter you from making a beeline for it – because this is hands down the best of them (even better than Tim Burton's 'Alice in Wonderland' in fact). True to its title, it is great and wonderful, an ageless and timeless fantasy deserved to be enjoyed in history with its forbearer.",Oz the Great and Powerful
83,mike48128,Did We All Watch the Same Movie? Just Wonderful!,9,13 April 2015,"Sure, it's not the 1939 classic. So what? Much more ""animated"" in the sense of lush backgrounds, fantastic Pixar-like quality (actually by Sony). Seamless special effects. Make up and costumes are magnificent. Totally ""blown away"" by the ""3D"" tornado flight to ""OZ"". Still thrilling in ""2D""! Much better and truer to the spirit of the original film. It has one song similar to a ""1939"" song, and it's sung by The ""Munchkins"". Danny Elfman created an amazing musical score. The acting? Pretty good, but too much ""goin' and yeah"" instead of ""going and yes."" Pronounce the words, people, don't slur them. James Franco ""nailed it"" as the sweet con man wizard who is not quite sure of his own abilities. Ms. Kunis ""morphs"" all too abruptly into her mean-green self. Michelle Williams is gorgeous at age 34 and she is almost 10-years older than the other two actresses! The story only bogs down in the middle. A bit too long, like the 20 minute prologue. Otherwise,it was far better than I expected, even down to the poisonous poppy field and haunted forest creatures. There are some worts, too: The witch fights looked like green bolts of lightning borrowed from the Star Wars Emperor, yet similar to the ""red shoe sparks"" from 1939. The B/W prologue should have been formatted a bit larger and sepia-toned. Also, the Flying Baboons were far too nightmarish and bloodthirsty-looking with huge teeth. (""Mama, I don't like this part of the movie. I wanna go home."") Yes, that scary, and it is implied that they killed a few people and most certainly some ""China Dolls"". Overall, the best attempt since ""Return to OZ"" either live action or (badly) animated. (The Michael Jackson ""Wiz"" movie not even being considered, here.) It's not for everybody. I suspect it will shock and dismay 1939 ""OZ"" purists, but remember that two people died in that movie, too. (Both witches!)",Oz the Great and Powerful
84,JLRMovieReviews,No Classic But Still Interesting Prequel of Oz,8,10 November 2015,"In this prequel of sorts to the classic 1939 film ""The Wizard of Oz,"" James Franco plays a circus magician and showman. His name is Oscar and has several names to follow, but he is known to his friends as Oz. He awes the audience with some tricks, but is then called on to make a crippled, wheelchair-bound girl walk. When he says he can't, they boo him and throw things at him. They are not impressed. He comes across to his acquaintances as insincere and he is always on the make. But a past love comes to his trailer and they reminisce. On the run from the circus muscleman he's ired, he runs away from the circus only to be caught up in a twister. He is thrust in a colorful world over the rainbow, where he encounters a young lady who tells him that his presence has convinced her that a certain prophecy has come to be. He finds out the lady is a witch. In fact, all three witches in the 1939 film factor in the plot that unfolds here. Now that I have set the scene, I will add that I have avoided this film like the plague ever since it came out, due to the odd casting of James Franco!, of whom I have never understood the following and because it could never be anything like the original. Why are they making this film? But I dvr-ed this off USA with commercials out of curiosity and saw two minutes. It had an odd aura in the beginning with its black-and-white setting. Maybe I misjudged it. I thought I would watch some time later. That was a few months ago, and just this past weekend, I saw it. I was very impressed with the thought-out explanation of how events in the 1939 film came to pass. This was very imaginative, colorful, and also kind of campy, or broad in tone. It would have to be. While Franco was good as an opportunistic good-for-nothing, what really makes the film are the performances of the actresses as the witches: Mila Kunis and Rachel Wiesz but particularly Michelle Williams. And, I would watch this again. This would make an interesting double feature with ""The Wizard of Oz."" This should be a lesson to me.

The trailer sold the protagonist's problem as him being ""good"" but he wanted to be ""great."" Big whoop. I only watched it because I was on a plane with a very limited entertainment section and it took me 5 hours before I lowered my standards enough to watch this on a small screen in pretty mediocre quality. The film was okay, not too bad as a background movie. To be honest, I quite like the premise of this prequel, it's an interesting character to explore, but the biggest problem is in the casting.James Franco doesn't have the charisma for the role. It's so irritating how he's so hit and miss after I loved him so much in James Dean, 127 Hours and in a different way, Pineapple Express. Zach Braff will always be J.D. and Mila Kunis and Rachel Weisz felt really awkward in their roles. Michelle Williams is forever lovely and was the only one I felt really got into her role. I can't really judge the visuals given the screen quality, but I remember not being much of a fan from the trailers in the cinema. The problem with green-screen films like this when the whole environment is computer generated it means the actors stick out like sore thumbs and have to work extra hard to sell the effects. I didn't buy it here, it was atmosphere-less.The script is typical whimsy and it aims low for the family audience featuring lots of exposition, cheesy jokes and little nods to clichés since it can't risk being original. But the problem is that it's too bloated with characters with not enough time for them to settle in before they deserve to be affectionately treated. It's unfair to compare it to the original, but that was the only area I really quite liked The Wizard of Oz for, the affectionate use of characters. Too many in Oz were just kind of there without development. Although the whole situation with the witches got quite convoluted, I quite liked where it went in the climax with the nods to the original, but the pat on the back for filmmaking was kind of unnecessary.5/10",Oz the Great and Powerful

That being said it's not without it's own merits. The film focuses on the title character played by james Franco in a smarmy sort of unlikable way as he gets caught up in a Tornado and finds himself in the title place. But this isn't where the original happened this version is artificial to the max over crowded with an abundance of CGI and not the slightest bit of wit or intrigue to make it all worthwhile. Other films with similar setups have fared far better such as Avatar and even Alice in Wonderland because ultimately their stories were much more interesting. Upon arriving he meets Theodora played by a truly horrendous Mila Kunis woefully miscast. I understand what she was going for trying to achieve the over the top performance of the original but it feels forced, uncanny and unintentionally funny. Michelle Williams fares better as Glinda but even her role isn't very fleshed out. Anyways getting back to the setup a wicked witch is terrorizing OZ Rachel Weisz shows up to chew some scenery and there are flying baboons and yada, yada, yada. There are inspired moments such as the films intriguing finale, the porcelain doll and everything before they actually get to Oz. Sam Raimis use of the Imax format feels confused. Sure the fake landscapes are sort of nice but the film feels disjointed at times and thats part of the reason why it never really connects.

87,Troy_Campbell,A great and powerful let down.,3,9 March 2013,"If you're worried that this movie is in some way messing with the 1939 classic, fear not, for this is a prequel that tells a tale set long before Dorothy slips on some ruby slippers. What is of concern though, is just how horribly wrong director Sam Raimi and his cast get it in what should've been a rip-roaringly fun adventure with glorious musical numbers, beautiful visuals and memorable versions of characters we already know and love. From the god awful make-up of Mila Kunis' wicked witch and the failed attempts of comedy relief to James Franco's embarrassingly over-the-top performance as the titular wizard and the unrefined and leaden dialogue (with forced references that subsequently feel tacky); Oz is just one misstep after the next, making the two hour plus runtime a slog to get through. Even the CGI – in which a high standard is normally a given for a picture with a budget of $200m – is surprisingly underwhelming; the motion captured characters don't visually integrate with the human actors at all and the entirely CGI created environment is pretty in parts but often too shiny for its own good. Rachel Weisz provides a glimmer of entertainment as the unashamedly benevolent witch Evanora and the opening Kansas sequence shot in black and white with an old-school aspect ratio of 1.33:1 (ie, not widescreen) is a nice treat, but neither can save this from being a great and powerful let down.",Oz the Great and Powerful
88,blumdeluxe,Get rid of the cliches,6,4 September 2018,"""Oz the Great and Powerful"" tells the story of a fair magician, who is taken to the magical land of Oz by a storm, where he is designated to become the next king and defeat the evil witches. Now he has to come up with a plan how fake magic can get him out of this situation.The overall message is beautiful. You don't have to be the best at something, or powerful to have an impact and make a change. At times this is translated into beautiful and touching pictures as well. However, especially the first half of the film is so full of cliches that it is honestly hard to bear. He enters this world and literally the first girl falls in love with him and after what feels like ten minutes they're already planning their wedding in a tone that sounds more like a brainwash than it sounds romantic. Here again, I would like producers to take their own movie more serious and if they want to tell a love story, even if it has to be in short time, do so more believable. Apart from that it is a nice movie.All in all this is a prequel that no-one really asked for but that also hurts nobody. Seen as an individual film, it delivers a great message, creates beautiful pictures but sometimes stumbles over a mountain of cliches we could have lived without.",Oz the Great and Powerful
89,Pumpkin_Man,Before the Story You Know is the Legend of How it All Began!!!,10,10 March 2013,"I honestly enjoyed this prequel. It had great special effects, good characterization, and a great story that shows how the Wizard of Oz came to be. The film tries to make references to the original 1939 classic film without being sued by Warner Bros. James Franco stars as Oscar Diggs (Oz) a small-time magician and con artist in a traveling circus. When a twister comes thru Kansas, Oz is trapped in a hot-air balloon and transferred to the beautiful and enchanted Land of Oz. He is greeted by Theodora and tells him of the prophecy of a great Wizard coming and saving them from the Wicked Witch. Will a con-artist magician from Kansas be able to step up and save the people of Oz from the Wicked Witch's army? I highly recommend OZ: THE GREAT AND POWERFUL!!!",Oz the Great and Powerful
90,ketgup83,Oz was neither great nor powerful. Stunning graphics and visuals makes it watchable once,6,25 May 2013,"Fantasy adventure drama have always been alluring and attractive with splendid CGI , stunning cinematography and fun-loving characters. Oz , the great and powerful falls into this category except with weak direction and wafer-line story. A small time magician is swept away in a storm to the magical world where he is considered as a wizard who will fight the evil witch to free the people of OZ.From veteran Sam Raimi ( Evil Dead , Spiderman series), OZ the Great and Powerful comes a complete disappointment. The movie begins in black- white 35 mm format. Raimi gives a world-class visual effects introducing to the amazing world of Oz and here the movie brightens and turns colorful. However it is screenplay which plays the spoilsport and the movement of the film is very slow. Film turns interesting when the battle between good and evil begins and high dose of drama and CGI keeps the momentum strong. The climax is less convincing though I assume there will be more sequels to the series. I have been an ardent fan of Raimi's film but unfortunately this came a surprise if I were to compare his previous works. As I mentioned , special effects are mind-blowing along with decorative art-direction and enthralling cinematography. Dialogues are well below the mark . Editing could have been more convincing. James Franco is just about okay. He could have done much more better than. Rachael Weisz , Michelle William and Mila Kunis did fine. Overall , Oz was neither great nor powerful.

91,jeremycrimsonfox,"Before There Was Dorthey, There Was Oz",9,23 June 2019,"As a fan of the classic Wizard of Oz film starring Judy Garland, I actually like this film. The story is a prequel set in 1905, as magician and con artist Oscar Diggs is blown to Oz after escaping a strongman who wants to beat him up for flirting with his wife. When he lands, he meets many friends, including the winged monkey Finley, the lonely China Girl, and the good witch Glinda, whom Oscar was sent to kill by Evanora, the protector of the Emerald City, although she is as good as she says to be.Basically, Disney's second attempt at an Oz movie (the first one being Return to Oz, which was a box office bomb despite winning an Academy Award), this film has gotten some mixed reviews, but I like it. James Franco does a good job portraying Oscar Diggs, as he manages to portray a character who is a trickster who at first uses the legend of the wizard to make a quick buck, but soon discovers his destiny, and the other characters are good. The special effects are good, as China Doll looks so realistic, and the winged monkeys actually look frightening. This movie will have some frightening scenes (then again, The Wizard Of Oz had its fair share of scary moments, as I used to be afraid of the Wicked Witch of the West as a child, and so many other children, an episode of Mr. Roger's Neighborhood had the actress from that movie appear and dress up as the witch to show the character was make-believe). The music is also good, as it was composed by the legendary Danny Elfman, who has composed music for many other good films and even TV shows. This is a good movie that is worth checking out.",Oz the Great and Powerful
92,Joxerlives,Over the rainbow just got a lot more colourful!,7,22 March 2013,"Really liked this even though I'd never read the Oz books (indeed my entire knowledge comes from the 1939 Wizard of Oz, a dimly remembered VHS of Return to Oz and what I gathered from the series Terminator; The Sarah Connor Chronicles which used the Oz books as a recurring theme). Some great stuff here, I think James Franco is terrific, showing the same comic timing which made him so memorable in his guest role in 30 Rock. Bruce Campbell and Ted Rami in cameos of course, wouldn't be a Sam Rami film without them, what a shame he couldn't work his Oldsmobile into the script somewhere. If your heart didn't melt in the scene where Oz fixes the China Doll's legs then you ARE the Tin Man. Great performances from all three witches, especially from Mila Kunis who has perhaps the toughest role, you so feel for her when she cries from the Wizard's betrayal only for her tears to scar her (did I miss something, why does the water effect only her, what about the other witches?). The story really has the Simpson's knack or working both for children and adults. If you're a kid you think that when they talk of Oz 'dancing all night' with the witches it means just that. As an adult you're left in little doubt that he seduced them both. Also doesn't take a big step to see an incestuous subtext between all three magical sisters. Nice ref too with the 'cowardly' lion and China Doll paraphrasing Ash from Evil Dead 2, ""Let's go kill ourselves a witch!"". Of course the whole thing looks absolutely terrific, special effects finally now actually able to keep up with Frank Baum's considerable imagination. Really like Zach Braff in his role (remember the Wizard of Oz episode of Scrubs?). In some ways it's just hard to imagine that this was made by the same team which made The Evil Dead series and Xena but all told they do a great job with both script and direction, the twister scene is just marvellous.Love to see some more in this series.",Oz the Great and Powerful
93,ProjectAnomaly,Oz the Great and Powerful,3,30 May 2020,"Dang, this did not age well. We have a horrible main character, all other characters are useless, bland, and unmotivated, and everyone's actions seemed to be rather weak, without motive or merit behind them.",Oz the Great and Powerful
94,SanteeFats,Better than average,7,21 November 2014,"Okay we have a reprise on the OZ theme to some extent. No Dorothy, no lion, no scarecrow, and no cowardly lion, but it does take place in OZ after the obligatory storm scene that sends OZ, the wizard, to the Land of OZ. There he is thought to be the great wizard of prophecy who has come to free the land from the evil witch. Mila Kunis is the in between witch here. She is not evil until her sister, the true evil witch, feeds her a spelled apple that turns her hideously evil in her heart and appearance. This occurs after OZ has pulled his schtick on her and she thinks she will be his queen, not so. When she sees him doing the same with Glenda she has sister turn her evil. The CGI here is top notch. The china doll, the flying monkey and baboons, and all the other effects are great. In the end of course the evil witches are banished from the Emerald City and all is well at least until they want to do a sequel.",Oz the Great and Powerful
95,khanbaliq2,Though inconsistent Oz The Great And Powerful is still a funny and visually dazzling fantasy adventure.,7,18 March 2013,"Since Oz The Great And Powerful is a big budget special-effects film by Walt Disney Pictures it's been advertised for a long time. The trailer made me interested, and I was looking forward to watching the film. In the interviews director Sam Raimi and the cast mentioned that the film was made with 3D cameras. The 3D is used very well, but it's also clear from the beginning that a lot of effort was put into making the film look dazzling. The computer-generated imagery is very impressive. Not everything looks perfect but the CGI characters look almost realistic. Of note is the little China Girl voiced well by Joey King, the girl who played a young Talia al Ghul in The Dark Knight Rises (2012). The China Girl is a visual wonder and one of the most interesting characters. The whole cast is solid. James Franco, playing Oscar ""Oz"" Diggs, smiles a bit too many times but he's charming and compassionate in the role. Rachel Weisz as Evanora is beautiful and cunning while Mila Kunis sure can cackle in her striking costume as Theodora. Michelle Williams was a good choice to play Glinda because she comes off as well-meaning, knowing and sincere. Although well cast the film still suffers because there a a bit too many characters. It would have been better if there were two witches instead of three. The script, written by David Lindsay-Abaire and Mitchell Kapner, should have been better too. American author L. Frank Baum wrote thirteen novel sequels after The Wonderful Wizard Of Oz, so it shouldn't have been a problem to pick material from the rich mythology that he created. Raimi plays it safe by making the film similar to Victor Fleming's great The Wizard Of Oz (1939). The film's opening sequence is presented in black-and-white, transitioning into color when the protagonist arrives in Oz. But Raimi is an excellent director so there's no shortage of spectacle. Danny Elfman composed a forgettable score, but at least Mariah Carey's song Almost Home is a return to form for the singer-songwriter. Despite its shortcomings Oz The Great And Powerful is still a wondrous entertaining fantasy adventure that adults and especially children will enjoy. I recommend it.",Oz the Great and Powerful
96,Hollywood_Yoda,Great Companion Piece to the 1939 Film,9,1 April 2013,"""Oz the Great and Powerful"" is a sort of an intended prequel to the 1939 film ""The Wizard of Oz"" about how the witches and Oz came to be how it was when Dorothy arrived. The film stars Mila Kunis as Theodora (later a wicked witch) and James Franco as the Oscar Diggs/Oz. Zach Braff provides his voice for a flying monkey in a comedic role.The film also opens in a black and white format then later transitions to color, much like the 1939 film did. Allusions to the 1939 film are throughout. As this is a Disney film and the 1939 film was MGM, it couldn't officially be called a prequel as the Ruby Slippers that Dorothy wore in that film were unable to be used in this film.The direction is by Sam Raimi of Spider-Man trilogy fame and the music score is by Danny Elfman (who works on Tim Burton films). The film has so far done very well at the box office, holding first place for two weeks before falling. Disney has already planned a sequel for this film (however, I'm not sure as to how that will turn out).",Oz the Great and Powerful
97,natashabowiepinky,"Despite the negative reaction, I liked it.",7,27 November 2013,"Ever wondered how The Wizard Of Oz arrived in the far off land and became supreme ruler of it? Thought not. But this film if nothing else, provides a compelling narrative to the idea, even if L. Frank Baum ( the author of the original stories) purists will be snorting with disgust. The special effects are just dandy, with animated winged monkeys and some astonishing magic spells worlds away from the primitive stylings of the 1939 classic. They doesn't overshadow the story though, as we are introduced to characters both old and new, who are sure to win over both children and adults alike with their charm and wit. There is really no comparing it to the movie from over seven decades ago however, as they both belong in completely different eras.And just like the original film, it begins in black and white before transforming into glorious technicolour once our phony magician finds himself accidentally transported to Oz. From then on, he must convince everyone, from munchkins to witches alike, he is powerful sorcerer, despite being totally out of his depth. James Franco in the role is a complete hoot with his bumbling but good hearted persona. He is joined by, amongst others, two CGI creations: A cute little walking, talking china doll, and and a flying simian in a bellhop's uniform who seems to lack the aggression of his larger relatives. The technology behind this pair is faultless, and they become as real as anything else here.So overall, a delightful extravaganza for all the family. See it.. 7/10",Oz the Great and Powerful
98,Anurag-Shetty,An extremely entertaining movie for the whole family!,8,17 April 2013,"Oz the Great and Powerful starts in the 1930s in Wisconsin. The movie starts in black & white and the original letterbox format, as a tribute to the original 1930 movie, The Wizard of Oz. Oscar Diggs/Oz(James Franco) is a magician/conman who performs in front of an audience every night doing wondrous optical illusions. However, his conning ways gets him in trouble with a lot of people. He escapes using a hot air balloon & gets caught up in a tornado. Suddenly, he's magically transported to the land of Oz, where we get color, full screen format, Dolby Digital surround sound & of course, 3D. Oz comes across a princess named Theodora(Mila Kunis), who believes that he is the great wizard of Oz that the prophecy foretold would come to save the people from the Wicked Witch. Oz, being the conman that he is, plays along. Along the way they meet a flying monkey named Finley(Zach Braff), who Oz uses as a servant. Theodora's sister Evanora(Rachel Weisz) is however, skeptical of this new 'wizard'. Evanora shows Oz all the gold & riches, which can be his if, he can defeat the Wicked Witch. So, Oz & Finley decide to go on a quest to find her. Oz tells Finley about his plan to con the people of Oz & escaping with all the riches. Along the way they meet China Girl(Joey King) & Glinda(Michelle Williams), the good witch. So, will Oz proceed with his greedy plan or will he curb his selfish desires, become a better man & save the people of Oz.I enjoyed every minute of this movie. I don't know why there is so much criticism. It's not supposed to be a masterpiece. It's just a fun, time pass movie for the whole family. This is a sort of prequel to the original. Sam Raimi & his team have created a surreal & enchanting world which looks mind blowing in 3D. A note on the performances. James Franco is great as Oz. Franco brings a sort of clumsy & goofy charm to the character. However, he's not as effective in the more serious scenes of the film(which could have been pulled off by Robert Downey Jr. who was Disney's first choice). Mila Kunis is effective as Theodora. However, she overacts in some scenes. Rachel Weisz is brilliant in her sassy portrayal of Evanora. Michelle Williams is spectacular as Ms.Goody-Two-Shoes, Glinda. The voice acting of Zach Braff & Joey King is outstanding as Finley & China Girl respectively. I would like to conclude by saying that this is a perfect weekend outing with your wife & kids. Go for it!",Oz the Great and Powerful
99,aesgaard41,Well Done Effort - For Kids,9,3 April 2013,"Not a lot of people know this but since the Middle Ages, people have been vanishing through dimensional apertures on Earth and turning up in a mystical story book land full of fairies, elves and mystical creatures. They vanish in ships at sea, through caves in mountains, down rabbit holes, through wardrobe cabinets and in bodies of water into this mystical land where they have created mystical lands. We know this realm by various names Narnia, Neverland, Wonderland and most famously as Oz. The children who have actually made it back have actually inspired some of the most famous stories in literary history. One of them was told to L. Frank Baum and later made into one of the greatest movies of all time. Anyone who know the movie should be aware Walt Disney wanted to do ""The Wizard Of Oz"" to follow his success on Snow White, and who else but Sam Raimi should be allowed to help them finally catch up these years later and make a prequel to this story. Oh, it's been updated a few times, usually in animated form and once in the Early 90s with a very young Fairuza Balk, but Raimi's film here stays more in spirit to the 1938 movie than anything else so far. His production does a superb job turning the backdrops of the 1938 movie into visually-stunning three-dimensionally rendered icons of the locations we know and love, and it shares a few ties to the original movie. Blink and you'll miss meeting Dorothy's parents, the Cowardly Lion and the origins of Glinda's bubble and the Witch's broom among others. Unfortunately, Disney cannot repeat anything MGM made especially for their version (ruby slippers, for one). Raimi has a gift for directing movies requiring CGI, and his balance of awe and humor is right on track. Oz should be just as terrifying at times as well as mystical. James Franco is wonderful in the role as the ersatz wizard, both charismatic and cunning at times, much more stronger dramatically than Johnny Depp might have been, despite accusations of miscasting. (No offense, Johnny, but you're not known for strong characters, only eccentric ones.) Although, one night wonder how far Robert Downey Jr. might have gone with the role. Mila Kunis is stunning, delightfully relishing her part as the future Wicked Witch halfway, although after her transformation, it is weird seeing the witch with a D-Cup in a push-up bra, and her cackle is almost spot on with Margaret Hamilton. Her scene during her transformation should be her audition for any future up-coming ""She Hulk "" movie. Michelle Williams, Rachel Weis and Zack Braff round out the incredible movie, which is definitely more faithful to the classic MGM motion picture than anything else seen so far, even the unofficial Fairuza Balk sequel from the 90s. I loved it, and I'm really intrigued to want to see it again and again and again I just hope the future DVD has some decent bonus features",Oz the Great and Powerful
100,brookenichole-98054,It's alright,6,22 January 2021,"Oz the Great and Powerful is alright. When I first saw this movie I had thought it was amazing. Now, not so much. It's decent, but falls flat a lot. The first act is slow, the second act is where it really picked up, then it fell again at the third act. Some positives: the coloring in this movie is gorgeous and vibrant. Some of this movie is actually really funny, and the acting is not too bad. James Franco and Michelle Williams were fantastic with great chemistry. Mila Kunis was a terrific Wicked Witch and Rachel Weiz was okay. Joey King and Zach Braff were also really entertaining.
Now the negatives: Mila Kunis' screaming was so annoying that half of the time I was so sick of it. And like I said, the story can get boring. Also, this movie is terrifying for kids. Between the two witches, the flying monkeys, and countless other things I was pretty surprised at.
Overall, a decent film.",Oz the Great and Powerful

102,rebeljenn,Fun film but could be better,6,2 March 2013,"I enjoyed this film, and it works well at a prequel to the original film ""The Wizard of Oz"". The film has many similarities with the style of the original in its story-telling (I won't go into this much as I don't want to spoil it). Generally, it's a fun fantasy-adventure film.However, some negative points: I found the pacing or editing to be slightly off. The film is just over two hours long, but I felt that it could be a little longer in some scenes and shorter in others. I think they tried to cram too much into the film. Also, I found the characters to be a little wooden. (I thought the acting was generally good, so I am not faulting the acting as I felt the three witches and Oz did a great job.). I was not able to care about the characters as much as I did in the original film. Thirdly, I found the use of CGI to be a little problematic with some of the characters and areas where they were just showing off the CGI. I wish story would be more important than the CGI. I think I probably had trouble letting go of the original film and comparing it too much, so please don't try to compare it with the classic film when you see it. However, you will see some clues and similarities with the original film and this one.",Oz the Great and Powerful
103,bryank-04844,"If Dorothy were to witness this, she would have never returned to Oz.",2,2 September 2015,"But, that is besides the point. Let's just take a look at the film itself for what it is. What we have here is a Sam Raimi directed film with what seems like Tim Burton's crew, with an A-List cast which unfortunately have no business playing these roles. And I'd imagine if one wanted to make a prequel, it would try and stand alone from its predecessor, however here, we are treated to many of the same scenes that we caught in Oz, even starting with a twister in Kansas.James Franco plays Oscar or Oz for short as he is a magician in a traveling circus, hustling people out of their money while breaking the hearts and promises to every girl he meets. I would even go to say that Oz is an unlikable slime ball who treats even his only friend like dirt. After a magic show, a beautiful girl (Michelle Williams) confesses her love to Oz to which he replies that he would rather be something great than marry and love her. Suddenly, a giant twister, much like the one we saw in 1939, swallows Oz and his hot air balloon up and he awakes in a foreign land.Oz soon meets Theodora (Mila Kunis) who believes Oz is the wizard from their prophecy and will save the people of Oz from the wicked witch. She persuades him to journey with her to the Emerald City and on the way meets a small adorable flying monkey voiced by Zach Braff, who back in Kansas was Oz's assistant. They also come across China Girl (Joey King), who is an actual china doll where her village of china tea pots and cups were destroyed by the wicked witch, leaving her the sole survivor.Once at the Emerald City, Theodora introduces Oz to her sister Evanora (Rachel Weisz), who is also a witch and is not what she seems. Evanora and Theodora talk Oz up to set out and stop the wicked witch only to find out that who he thinks the wicked one is, is actually Glinda the Good Witch (Williams again). Glinda knows Evanora's dark secret and realizing now that Oz knows this, devises a plan on her own sister which transforms the beautiful Theodora into the iconic green witch we have come to know for over 60 years now. Much like Dorothy, Scarecrow, Tin Man, and the Cowardly Lion; Oz, Williams, China Girl, and the flying monkey set out to try and stop the evil that is plaguing Oz.Before I get serious for a minute, I want to state that I really enjoy all of these actors and own most or all of their films, which I love. However, every one of these actors in the film is horribly miscast to the point where it's embarrassing to watch. Franco has no charm, wit, nor chemistry to anything in the film. You just don't care for the guy and what he does or says. His performance is uninspired, lacking, and dull. And I don't think anyone will buy that Kunis is the evil wicked witch of the west, no matter how much makeup you put on her. Instead of being scared of the witch, you just laugh at her while she cackles. Williams is decent here, but has no emotion and is completely stale. If only she was more lively and pleasant, it would have done wonders to the film. Weisz turns in an okay performance at best, but is too busy screaming or scheming the entire film to get a good read. While we see an actual live Braff for a split second on screen, his voice work is decent enough and gets the job done, but it's nothing spectacular. In short, there are 50 better choices for these roles then what was cast.Since the acting performances were less than thrilling, I would have hoped for some amazing visual effects. I was let down again. We are treated to a mix of CG effects and real effects. The CG ranges from fairly good to down right laughable. As a good chunk of the film is seeing the sights of Oz, a lot of the small animals and plants looked completely fake and animated. I've seen better effects on films with 1/20th the budget. As for Raimi's direction, it's as always great. He has a unique way with the camera, and those who enjoy his earlier work of the 'Evil Dead' films, will smile a bit with some of the camera shots as well as a climactic moment with a witch.There were only a couple of things I enjoyed about the film. One is that while we are in Kansas at the beginning of the film, we are treated watching the picture in black and white and in 4:3 aspect ratio. I loved this little homage, and as we are transported to Oz, we get the entire wide-screen picture in glorious color. Also, since this is a Sam Raimi, a lot of us will ask, ""Is Bruce Campbell in it?"" The answer is YES. Campbell even gets top billing with the rest of the cast in the opening credits, unfortunately his screen time is less than 30 seconds, but you'll be able to spot him out. The only other thing I enjoyed was the new evil flying monkeys, which were actually a bit scary. I'd imagine some younger viewers might have nightmares from this.'Oz the Great and Powerful' is nothing more than a film company trying to make a quick buck. In return we get a half-assed attempt at something that could have been amazing. I'd skip this in the theater and wait to see it on your screen at home for free.

105,Geeky Randy,Geeky Randy's summary,4,28 February 2014,"Interesting concept based on L. Frank Baum's novels that gives us more history into the title character, played with much charisma by James Franco. However, once Sam Raimi sails us to all the favorite destinations like the Yellow Brick Road, Emerald City and Munchkin Land, you have to wonder if this CGI infested prequel—where our title character, who was played so coyly mysteriously by Frank Morgan in the 1939 classic, originates with little depth or interesting backstory other than he's a trickster—is really worth the trip. Mila Kunis is awful, Weisz is very useless (especially with the absence of ruby slippers due to legal restraints with using iconic elements that originated in the 1939 film), and Williams is lackluster (though this is not the fault of Williams, as her character's substance is downgraded with cheap special-effects like the floating bubble actually bouncing on the ground). Perhaps the film's worst quality is a simple one... the film just goes on and on for far too long. However, the climax is pretty decent... for a prequel.★★ (out of four)",Oz the Great and Powerful
106,ersinkdotcom,'Oz: The Great and Powerful' serves as a successful homage to classic film,8,13 March 2013,"Journeys to the Land of Oz have been few and far between when it comes to the world of cinema. Many projects have been in development over the years, but none of them can get off the ground. It's not hard to understand why. MGM's 1939 musical version has long been recognized as the definitive film version of L. Frank Baum's magical tale. Walter Murch's attempt at a sequel fell flat in 1986, even though ""Return to Oz"" has gained a cult following over the years. Walt Disney Pictures has successfully beaten MGM to the punch by providing what I and many others will see as the ""official"" unofficial prequel to the original.In ""Oz: The Great and Powerful,"" a crooked circus magician named Oscar Diggs is swept away to a magical land. Upon arriving, he is mistaken as the mystical wizard who is foretold to be the deliverer of its people from the grasp of an evil witch. In order to free them from her clutches, he must steal her magic wand. Oscar embarks on a dangerous journey to find the witch. He's accompanied by a flying monkey and a china doll on his adventures through the whimsical and dangerous land.I'm going to get brutally honest now. ""Oz: The Great and Powerful"" uses every bit of imagery it can legally get away with from MGM's ""The Wizard of Oz."" Director Sam Raimi isn't trying to exploit or make money off of someone else's concepts. You can tell the only thing he's concerned with is paying homage to the 1939 classic. Although there are slight (and I do mean slight) alterations to the designs of the characters and sets, this looks exactly like the original classic for the most part.The Wicked Witch might be a different shade of green and not have a wart, but the rest of her features are a younger version of Margaret Hamilton's depiction of the character. Another perfect example is the design of the Wizard's Throne Room and the way he appears in a cloud of smoke and fire to his audiences. Did we mention the movie starts in black and white and changes to color when the Wizard gets to Oz? I think I've made my point.Another thing I've noticed many critics complaining about is the acting. It's being called dull, lifeless, and other such things. I didn't find this to be true at all. You can tell James Franco, Mila Kunis, Michelle Williams, and Rachel Weisz all respected Sam Raimi's vision and wanted to do their best to make ""Oz: The Great and Powerful"" a visual experience no one would forget. Is Franco a bit heavy-handed and corny at times? Of course he is. That's how the Wizard acted in the original movie as well.The special effects continued to get better and better throughout the film. The flowers and backgrounds looked rather artificial at first. I could also tell that the film would be headache-inducing in 3D. The camera was sweeping across the scenery way too fast. I would like to note that much of the background resembled a sunnier version of Wonderland from another recent Disney fantasy adaptation directed by Tim Burton.""Oz: The Great and Powerful"" will satisfy fans of L. Frank Baum's books and the original 1939 classic. It's an action-packed journey through a whimsical land you won't forget. While it's a new story using modern special effects, it will leave you wanting to return to the whimsical land as soon as you leave the theater.",Oz the Great and Powerful
107,Likes_Ninjas90,The magic has you believing for this long that it's best not to question the sleight of hand,8,4 March 2013,"To be clear, Oz the Great and Powerful is not a prequel to the 1939 classic The Wizard of Oz. It is a precursor to the book by L. Frank Baum, ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"". As a children's author Baum wrote 14 books about Oz but he never explored the backstory of the faux-wizard. It is a relief to say that director Sam Raimi (Evil Dead, Spider-Man) has made an origins film about the wizard, where the world of Oz is not only realised in stunning detail but plays host to a richly characterised anti-hero, who like the audience, comes to realise the power of illusion.The film is a technical marvel in 3D and overcomes many of the format's shortcomings. Filmmaker and author Lenny Lipton states that stereoscopic cinema (3D imaging), films with the added illusion of depth, is mostly projected using digital projectors and is what he calls 'field-sequential'. He argues that illumination is decreased by fifty percent because the light is divided between both of our eyes. Further, the polarizer filters in the 3D glasses block the light from the screen so that each eye sees a different image but the lighting is dimmed. A footlambert (fl) is the unit of measurement for illumination and film critic Roger Ebert believes regular film projection offers 15fLs, whereas 3D films only display between three and six foot- lamberts.The art design Oz has been meticulously planned to address these issues by brightening the screen and reducing the gloom. Primary colours are well-chosen and employed spectacularly, showcasing plants and vegetation by using red, yellow and green palettes that saturate the frames with colour and light. The widescreen ratio also combines effortlessly with Raimi's formal control to showcase these sumptuous features. Watch as the camera crabs sideways while Oz walks with his friends down the yellow brick road. The fluidity of the camera as it drifts across the frame accentuates the spatial width and depth of the world and provides us with enough time to absorb many of these visual treats. Together, the high contrast lighting effects and 3D depths make this an incredibly beautiful film. Not all the scenes are shot in colour though. The opening scenes in Kansas, 1905, are photographed in black and white and use a 4:39 box ratio, like the 39 film. These scenes are valuable, establishing Oz's personality as a magician who treats the people around him like they are props in a trick. He lies to women, giving several of them the same music box, and he sees no reason to befriend his assistant Frank (Zac Braff). He doesn't even deem himself as worthy enough to be with Annie (Michelle Williams) either. Chased by an unhappy strongman, he jumps into a hot air balloon, unaware of the tornado that will whisk him away to Oz. One of the first people that Oz meets is Theodora (Mila Kunis), a timid and brittle witch, who falls in love with him, telling him that he is a great wizard. As she leads him to Emerald City, they meet a talking monkey Finley (voiced by Zach Braff), who accompanies them.Arriving at the city, Oz is introduced to Theodora's sister Evanora (Rachel Weisz), who stresses he'll have all the riches he wants once he defeats the white witch Glinda (Michelle Williams again). Oz travels with Finley to find her and they discover a pintsized China Girl (voiced by Joey King), who needs repairing and insists on joining them.The film balances precariously on James Franco's performance and his expressive face punctuates every lie and self-serving opportunity of the wizard. Enlivened by Franco's infectious and cheeky comic energy, Oz becomes an unlikely and funny anti-hero, weaseling his way through situations but learning to utilise his powers of deception in clever ways, without drastically changing his personality. Baum always believed in empowered women and the three witches each feel distinctive in their presence on screen. They're great examples of how efficiently women can be used in modern blockbusters. Michelle Williams, with her face never short of emotion, brings gentleness and sincerity to Glinda, even when she becomes aware of the deception around her. Many scenes in the film are accompanied by the power of deception, lies and illumination. Since Baum was against violent resolutions, the battles in this film are unique in their tactics of trickery. The people of Quadling Country can't kill so there's a clever visual scene where scarecrows are dollied across an open field to draw out an army of winged monkeys into a bloodless trap.Additionally, a projector Oz uses late in the film echoes the very formal features of cinema used to create this extraordinary and beautiful world. Though the film concludes without a bookend to determine whether the Land of Oz is real or a dream, the magic has you believing for this long that it's best not to question the sleight of hand.",Oz the Great and Powerful
108,griffolyon12,This Yellow Brick Road Isn't for Everyone,6,9 March 2013,"Oz the Great and Powerful is a hit-and-miss movie that sometimes hits all of the moments just right, but misses where it is most needed in order to make the movie feel as if it's a cohesive whole.This Wizard of Oz prequel follows a conman magician from Kansas who goes by the name of Oz, portrayed by James Franco. When Oz boards a hot air balloon and is sucked into a tornado, he finds himself in the wonderful world of Oz itself, where due to his magic tricks and conman persona, he is mistaken as the Wizard of prophecy who will defeat the Wicked Witch and free Oz. Thus starts the journey of this film, so on and so forth. To be perfectly honest, there is a lot to love here, but there is just as much that just irked me at times. I loved Michelle Williams as Glinda, but I found that James Franco was trying too hard at times to try and realize the Wizard of Oz that was in the script. Franco seemed to find that overacting was the way to try and sell the illusion of Oz's conman ways, but he still overacts when Oz has revealed he isn't a wizard and has become a good man. There isn't any real warmth or authenticity that Franco exudes in the role that makes me like Oz, or believe that he's changed, which is why the film so often missteps. Not to mention, the film never takes time to slow down and let the story breathe to take in the wonder that is the land of Oz, like the 1939 musical did, and neither does it allow the characters much time to become more than two-dimensional beings. This is the biggest drawback of Oz the Great and Powerful, because you never really get the sense that the land of Oz is a living breathing place that isn't just a bunch of computer wizardry, making the film often feel as fake as Oz's magic tricks. However, Oz the Great and Powerful is not a terrible movie.While the movie never truly takes much time to develop the characters, the plot is rock solid and tells a simple enough story that will definitely entertain children, that is if they haven't already burst into tears at how scary Sam Raimi has made the flying monkeys this time about. It's definitely noticeable that this is a Sam Raimi film. Like he did in his Spider-Man movies, he uses many of his horror movie visual tricks to make the Wicked Witch, as well as her flying minions, genuinely terrifying, which is fine for me as an adult, but perhaps it's too much for children, so do heed caution before you take a small child to this movie. Moving on from the well-done scares, the movie also features a very likable supporting cast, with actor Zach Braff stealing almost each scene his CGI flying monkey, Finley, is in. Then, there's the black-and- white Kansas set-up at the very beginning, where we meet Oz and learn about who he is. This set-up takes nearly the first thirty minutes, but it's the strongest and most sincere thirty minutes of the entire movie.While I don't think Oz the Great and Powerful is by any means an instant classic, it will delight it's targeted fanbase, which is children. The movie, while too simple for an adult like me looking for a little more character and grandeur to the tale, is very funny, and its heart is always in the right place, teaching that one can make themselves whatever they wish to be. However, I do strongly advise parents seeing this movie first without their kids and then deciding whether or not their kid is old enough for it.I give Oz the Great and Powerful a 6 out of 10!",Oz the Great and Powerful
109,Laakbaar,"If you believe, anything is possible",8,16 March 2013,"I rather enjoyed this hugely entertaining film. It is a worthy modern successor (or, um, predecessor) to the 75-year-old classic.Raimi and the writers have created a latter-day Oz classic that is both entertaining for modern audiences and fully honours the legacy of the first film. If you look for them, there are plenty of clever nods to the earlier film. The costuming and overall imagery in this movie are delightful. The CGI effects are spectacular and beautiful, right from the hurricane to the scary monkeys to the projection machine.Watching this movie is an imaginative and fun experience, even for jaded adults reliving the feeling of what it was like to watch The Wizard of Oz for the first time. I think kids would love this film, although admittedly we live in more cynical times and we've forever ruined the concept of childhood. I'll leave it to other reviewers to report whether the cyberchildren of the internet and video game age are willing to buy into the premise of the land of Oz, singing Munchkins and a green witch riding a broomstick. This movie can be fully enjoyed even if you haven't seen, or only vaguely remember, the original movie. However, there is an added layer there for those who do know the original movie.My only reservation is that ""Oz The Great and Powerful"" isn't a musical at all. I think it would have been great to have included modern remakes of some of the old classics that came out of this movie, i.e. ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" and ""We're Off to See the Wizard"". And I think they could really have had fun reproducing the Munchkin song and dance routine. It's a shame they decided not to include that.The acting and casting were fine. The criticism of Franco and Kunis in the reviews below is not right at all. Franco definitely had more than enough charisma, charm and presence to pull off the role of Oscar Diggs and to play the lead role in the film. As the rogue with a good heart, he had me on his side the whole way. I wasn't particularly a fan of his before, but I am now. And I thought Kunis nailed her roles perfectly, both pre-change and post-change. She was cast perfectly for her role. If anyone was miscast, it was Weisz (one of my very favourite actresses).The catchphrase of the original 1939 movie was ""there's no place like home""; in this 2013 movie it's ""if you believe, anything is possible"". I'm not sure I agree that showmanship and illusion are enough, but it is a message that reflects our times.As usual on IMDb for any film that doesn't involve a comic-book hero, the score is too low and the reviews too negative. Don't listen to them. I'd go see this one.",Oz the Great and Powerful
110,dragokin,pleasant to watch,7,28 May 2013,"Prior to watching Oz the Great and Powerful i considered it to be one of many remakes, prequels and sequels that have been in vogue in the past years. Even television hasn't been immune to the trend with Once upon a Time retelling classical fairy tales. And when the movie started, it was clear that it deals with the conflict between good and evil. Despite all the obstacles the good guys were facing, we were convinced that they will prevail.However, there were surprises along the way, apart from the twists in the plot. The story is in no way sleazy or boring, as it was the case in similar movies, for example, Mirror Mirror (2012) or Snow White and the Huntsman (2012). Numerous references to The Wizard of Oz (1939) with Judy Garland in the lead role were probably aiming at generations that grew up with it. I assume that for those not acquainted with Oz books, especially younger viewers, Oz the Great and Powerful might be just another fantasy thriller.There is nothing really groundbreaking in this movie, yet it is pleasant to watch. For a moment it will make you believe that a happy ending is an inevitable thing in life.The cast is well picked and offers a solid performance, including the most minor characters.",Oz the Great and Powerful
111,TheSquiss,Oz the Greatly Powerless. Some spectacle but little magic.,5,25 March 2013,"Sometimes a title is just asking for trouble. In 1981, when Depeche Mode released I Just Can't Get Enough, they were rewarded with one of the finest one-line reviews ever, courtesy of Neil Tennant: I did. You will.Using Oz the Great and Powerful as a title is a recipe for disappointment. No, it isn't. And, yes, it does.There's little point in seeing Oz the Great and Powerful if you haven't already experienced The Wizard of Oz, or at least read L. Frank Baum's novel, though you need not have suffered the quagmire that was Michael Jackson's The Wiz. Assuming you have watched/read the original, you'll know the 'wizard' is little more than a little man behind a curtain using smoke and mirrors aiming to scare the bejesus out of cowardly lions and little girls in blue dresses. This is, essentially, the backstory.Oscar Diggs (James Franco) is a two-bit magician in a travelling circus in Kansas with a penchant for pretty girls. His dubious morals lands him in trouble and he hops into a hot air balloon to escape an angry boyfriend, veers into the path of a cyclone and winds up in Oz where he is mistaken for the mythical Wizard of Oz who, the prophesy states, will save the land from the evil witch. Naturally, there are three witches to chose from and all is not as it seems.Or, rather, that is director Sam Raimi's intention though the reality is that everything is pretty much exactly as expected. Just less magical.As you'd expect, the scene is set in monochrome with characters interacting with Oscar in one guise, only to appear as a different person/creature when full colour blasts our senses. Chief amongst these is Zach Braff who appears in Kansas as Finley, Oscar's put-upon assistant, only to appear in Oz as his, um, monkey assistant, Frank.In Kansas there is a smouldering excitement brought in part by the wonder of the circus, in part by the expectation of great adventures in Oz. When we do reach Oz, it does at first feel as though our expectations will be realised. The screen is filled (digitally, alas) with beautiful landscapes; flowers unfold, blades of grass wave like reeds and play tunes, saturated colours dance before our eyes, bizarre and attractive creatures delight and there are vast riches to be relished... There is wonderment around every corner and greed in Oscar's eyes and maybe, just maybe When witch number number one, Theodora (Mila Kunis), sashays onto the screen and into Oscar's life, she dazzles with her beauty and the luscious red of her hat and jacket and the world feels like a good place. But there's nothing beyond the surface. All around us is spectacle but there is no depth. The story and the acting are as superficial as the digital gimmicky that gives the illusion of Oz. For a film about wizardry, Oz the Great and Powerful commits the cardinal crime: It has no magic! Kunis, initially, delights but as her character 'evolves' she becomes a plastic version as if prosthetics restrict her talent. Rachel Weisz gives a good go at being sweetly bad but she, too, is caught in a vortex that sucks out her natural brilliance and replaces it with something muted and less effective. Bar the first half of Evanora, witch number three, Glinda (Michelle Williams) is the most engaging but not even she really grabs our emotions and makes us truly care.In the original, the witch was the epitome of evil. She was angular, pointed, warted, she shrieked and she still puts the willies up me thirty odd years after I first watched her through my fingers. When big, bad, green and nasty witch appears in this version of Oz, she looks bloated, slightly unpleasant and mostly annoying. I don't want to hide from her, I want to swat her with one of those fly-catching electrified tennis racquets and watch her fry.As for Franco, I can't help thinking he assumed he was playing Oscar and Braff was too polite to speak up and say ""Um, actually, that's my part."" It would certainly have been a more interesting film and we might have cared a little more about the quirky wizard he'd have given us.But at least we can rely on the munchkins, right? You know, the little people who terrorized the film set in 1939, snorted mountains of coke (allegedly), goosed the witch (allegedly) and generally behaved like delightful rascals both on screen and off. Ah, no. When we do meet them, they are disappointingly bland and virtually irrelevant. They feel as though they exist purely so an exec can tick a box: Yellow brick road? Check. Munchkins? Check(ish).They, like Oz the Great and Powerful as a whole, disappoint. After the initial excitement we realize Oz is hollow and empty and the greatest emotion I carried away with me was a vague sense of boredom.In 1939 they didn't have CGI; they didn't use green screens like this; they didn't have anything beyond the very basic 'trick photography' our parents marveled at. Instead they just got on and did it for real. And what happened? It won Oscars, it delighted millions and we watch it every Christmas! Yes, your children will enjoy Oz the Great and Powerful for the colour and the funny monkey but do them a favour: turn down the lights, build a tent out of blankets and snuggle down with them to watch the original. It's the true Oz and the only Oz that matters.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",Oz the Great and Powerful
112,judywalker2,Just average and slightly boring,5,19 March 2013,"Went to see this movie because my daughters wanted to see it. I'm personally not a fan of James Franco as I think he is one of the worst actors in Hollywood but I love Rachel Weisz so I figured I could tolerate Mr. Franco. The movie starts out attempting to pay homage to the original Wizard of Oz and that was okay. The tornado was well done and that's when everything goes to pot. Oz though colorful is nothing but an empty cartoon land, filled with boring witches. The scenery was too out there. This is suppose to be a real place and it didn't seem at all real. I really thought that like Dorothy, Oz would wake up in the end to find it all a dream. As far as characters, the human ones were slighted. The monkey and the china doll had more personality than Oz and the witches combined. Well I didn't have high expectations going in and I have to say that it met the low ones perfectly.",Oz the Great and Powerful
113,richieandsam,Great film...,8,20 March 2013,"OZ: THE GREAT AND POWERFUL  What a great movie!  I was not entirely sure about this movie when I first heard Disney was  going to making it... but this time it was a success.  During the 80s, Disney made an Oz film entitled Return to Oz... do you  remember it? It was not a bad film. It starred a young Fairuza Balk as  Dorothy as she returns to the land of Oz. It was a lot darker than the  original and nowhere near as good, but I did like it. It was a huge  flop for Disney though and was slated by almost everyone.  This time around though they did a brilliant job.  Oz: The Great and Powerful is a prequel to the original classic. It is  the story a magician named Oz, and how he arrived in the land of Oz and  becomes the great Wizard of Oz.  The actors in this film were perfect for the roles. James Franco played  Oz... I was not sure he was right for the role, but after watching it I  can say that it was a good choice. Mila Kunis plays Theodora, the  Wicked Witch of the West. She is my favourite character in the whole  film. You kind of feel sorry for her character really. It is a sad  story. Her sister, Evanora, is the wicked with of the East. Evanora was  played my Rachel Weisz. The film was directed by Sam Raimi.  I would say that this is similar in a way to Tim Burtons Alice in  Wonderland in feel. This was a beautiful film. The colours were nice  and bright and Oz looked amazing.  There was 1 disappointment for me, but I won't say what that was  because I don't want to give away any of the story. But if you have  seen it and want to discuss it... message me.  I will give this film 8 out of 10.  A great film that stayed strong throughout.",Oz the Great and Powerful

115,abcvision,world of wonder! WOW!,10,2 April 2013,This movie is one of the best movies I have seen this year. It is the pre- equal to the Wizard of Oz story. Of how the Wizard came to be in the magical Emerald City. The story is very simply divided between the good guys and the bad guys. You discover that not all witches are bad witches but not all good witches are necessarily good. This small time con magician Oz (James Franco) ends up being whisked away to the magical Emerald City. He falls in line with a prophecy and with the help of new friends seeks to solve the darkness. The colors are magnificent and there are many instances that play homage to the original Wizard of Oz. I was completely drawn into the story and at the end you feel good about yourself and have hope for these world that far-far away. We ain't in Kansas any more.,Oz the Great and Powerful
116,Al_The_Strange,"""I don't want to be a good man...I want to be a great man.""",8,21 March 2013,"One key thing the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz proved is that movie magic and magic in movies go hand-in-hand. This might be a mild spoiler, but most of us know by now that the actual wizard of Oz was never a real wizard, but a con-artist who used machines and gimmicks to wow the inhabitants of Oz into submission. It's also an interestingly insightful reflection on filmmaking itself, with the filmmakers fulfilling the exact same role as the wizard; they use camera tricks, elaborate sets, costumes, and special effects to bring the fantasy to life before the audience, and trick us all into believing that Oz can be a real place with real people. Even though the film is incredibly fake-looking and laughably cheesy, it's become cemented as an endearing classic in American cinema; it's an impressive feat that this 70+ year old classic still captures audiences' imaginations.Obviously, nothing can top the 1939 Wizard of Oz. The 2013 prequel, Oz: The Great and Powerful, follows into the modern trend of taking classic fairy tales and giving them an epic-scale treatment (along the same lines as Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland and yesteryear's Snow White and the Huntsman). It is on that level that O:TGAP should be evaluated; it's a big, large-scale remix of the classic Wizard of Oz elements with a massive CGI spectacle.The most critical of audiences probably won't be impressed, but I personally felt that this film is decently entertaining. It has action and peril, especially in the last act; the final battle in Emerald City offers a satisfying climax with plenty of spectacle, but without overdoing things that much. I was thrilled to see the witches fighting, and it was pretty cool. Even though CGI is dispensed liberally throughout the feature with mixed results, it is a visually striking experience at times. There is a lot of silly humor thrown about as well, which may come off as a hit or a miss. Overall, it is a whimsical adventure that made me smile at times, and kept my interest all the way through.The film's most redeeming quality will be it story. The actual plot is somewhat derivative - it's pretty much the exact same formula as the 2010 Alice in Wonderland - and the story is predictable, especially if you know what happens in the classic Oz film. Still, long-time fans will geek out at all the Wizard of Oz references, and this film does a fine job of establishing the characters and concepts that would ultimately lead up to the original movie. The film has a number of one-dimensional side characters who could have benefited from more development. However, the wizard takes the spotlight throughout, and the film does a great job of establishing his character, showing his growth and development, and ultimately tying in the classic themes of magic, imagination, and belief with the story's pathos. It's not the same meta-theme that went into the old film, but this film uses it in a fashion that supports the story, and makes it just as interesting.This film features pretty solid and distinctive photography. You can bet that the opening scenes are black-and-white, and rest is color, just like the original film. It even uses a smaller, square aspect ration, until the actual Oz scenes, where the screen expands magically. Some shots are pretty wild, a few shots swung pretty heavily side-to-side, and plenty of other shots reminded me a lot of the Peter Jackson Middle Earth films, thanks to the frequent sweeping and movements. Editing is not bad. Acting is generally satisfying: James Franco won't impress everyone, but I felt his portrayal was appropriately showy and boisterous, and fit the character very well. Mila Kunis is regarded as the odd one out, and I'll admit that she did seem out of place at first, but I enjoyed her performances in the second half. Rachel Weisz is as great as ever, and it's hard not to love Michelle Williams. Writing is not too bad. This production has fine and dandy sets, props, and costumes, which mostly match up well with the original Oz film. Special effects look great in some spots, not so great in others. Music has its moments too.As expected from a Sam Raimi film, Oz: The Great and Powerful is a bright, colorful, humorous adventure with whimsey and zeal. It comes best recommended to non-discerning popcorn flick fans, families, and Wizard of Oz fans.4/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Good | Film: Good)",Oz the Great and Powerful
117,estreet-eva,Pales compared to the original but entertaining in its own right,6,2 August 2013,"Sequel-izing the transcendent ""Wizard of Oz"" represents a Sysphrian task but ""Oz"" does a fair job of presenting a fairly entertaining summer popcorn movie. James DiFranco's inherent sleaziness serves him well as the titular character, himself a charismatic charlatan. DiFranco, like the rest of the cast, does struggle to assert himself among the overwhelming digital animation which tends to make the proceedings clunky and without heart (Michael Bay Syndrome). Most especially the digital munchkins stand as a politically correct but emotionally misguided use of expensive technology. Other favorite characters from the original make more passing appearances replaced with less interesting protagonists like China Girl who suffers from the awkwardness of such a difference in scale. The yeoman-like writing may not have the timeless quality of the original (""I'll get you my little pretty!"") but it serves it purpose - to set up more digital effects well. In short, as Oz would say: ""turn off your brain and just watch the spectacle.""",Oz the Great and Powerful
118,lagudafuad,It was fun,7,14 March 2013,"Oz the Great and Powerful is Disney's prequel to the 1939 classic movie The Wizard of Oz, and it is set 20 years before the tale of Dorothy Gale's (Judy Garland) journey into the Land of Oz. The movie characters are based on The Oz series by L. Frank Baum.The movie is delightful and Disney paid homage to the old classic by starting the introduction of the movie's main character Oscar ""Oz"" Diggs (James Franco) in black and white and the moment he stepped into Oz the movie transformed to color, just like that of the 1939 classic which started in sepia tinted black and white, and the moment Dorothy got to Oz the movie transformed into colored.I enjoyed the colorful bit of the movie I do have to give kudos to the story, it was interesting and involving, I found myself drawn in and the idea that showed that The Wizard of Oz was first truly a con man, a con man of mere magic tricks who travels with a circus, until one day he found himself in the Land of Oz where they await their savior a Wizard so great that he will be able to defeat the witch sisters.Here our hero comes into Oz as a con man and we get to see him metamorphose into the wizard we know him to be in the The Oz Series.The movie did face some hiccups during production, some of which were due to the cast having other roles that they had to leave to go fulfill, and then there was the legal rights as Warner Bros owned all the rights to the elements used in the 1939 classic such things like: the color of the wicked witch of the west (here her shade of green differs from the 1939 classic), her mole was not present, the yellow brick road was also nowhere to be seen, although there is a brick road.Director Sam Raimi and James Franco worked together in the Spiderman trilogy where Franco played Osborne. Here Raimi did an impressive work coordinating the events that took place in this film.This movie did make reference to the characters in the old classic, like a lady Oz was seeing told him she is getting married to a man whose last name was Gale (Dorothy Gale), we see the creation of the scarecrow, we get to see the men who created the Tin Man and we saw how the cowardly lion became coward when he got frightened away by Oz.My take on this movie is that it is fun and a nice watch for those who have a mind that is ready to fly.www.lagsreviews.com",Oz the Great and Powerful
119,LloydBayer,Oz The Great And Powerful celebrates cinema's core ethos of 'Make Believe' even if some viewers find that it lacks the magical impetus of the 1939 original.,6,30 May 2014,"Keeping in mind that 2013 has barely reached cruising speed, I might be jumping the gun in saying this: if Oz The Great And Powerful is intended as the most visually immersive, most stunningly surreal and most colourfully vivid film of the year, it has a head start in the race to grab accolades for visual effects, production design and art direction. The catch, of course, is to experience this film the way it is intended to be experienced — in 3D, no less.To appreciate this movie in its simplest form, avoid wholly comparing this film with its proprietary 1939 classic The Wizard Of Oz. Written by Mitchell Kapner and David Lindsay-Abaire, and directed by Sam Raimi, this film prudently adds a fresh new twist to the original story without trying to make the original look old or outdated. Unfortunately, pundits tend to always refer to the original when judging hereditary strands of any remake. This is why I recommend perceiving Raimi's film as either a prequel or homage to the original. In not expecting children of the current generation to have watched, understood or appreciated Victor Fleming's original, Disney's powerhouse production team has evidently focused on the events leading up to L. Frank Baum's 1900 novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. (Essentially, this is what makes the film a prequel with symbiotic reverence to the 1939 film.) But whichever way you choose to appreciate its making, the outcome will be the same: a thrilling journey that takes us over, under and through the rainbow. But before we get there, Raimi's opening act is set in a monochromatic letter-box aspect ratio where we first meet the man destined to become a great and powerful wizard. Calling himself 'Oz', Oscar Diggs (James Franco) is anything but great. In fact, he is a womaniser and a circus magician with questionable ethics. Deemed a fraud and fleeing from his past, Oz's escape in a hot-air balloon is thwarted when a tornado sends him crashing towards an extremely colourful Emerald City, whereupon his arrival, naive inhabitants think he is the prophesised saviour of the land. Oz plays along but lands in trouble again while charming the socks of three gorgeous women — Glinda (Michelle Williams), Evanora (Rachel Weisz) and Theodora (Mila Kunis); all witches who will influence Oz's transformation from a faux wizard to one that saves the day.As a children's movie, Disney has outdone itself with a fantasy epic brimming with visual effects and cinematography that are both mind-blowing and out of this world. Quite literally, the Land of Oz appears to be the recent most stunning rendition of Middle-Earth and it flourishes with vibrant life. But with a running time of 130 minutes, children could wriggle around restlessly during the film's soap opera-esque moments arising from Oz's flirtatious shenanigans with said witches. There are also some frightening scenes that could startle younger children but these are arguably when 3D is at its immersive best. Casting and characters could be seen as a mixed bag for older viewers keen on panning between this film and previous versions. Although Franco gets by as an ostensible wizard, I still think Raimi's original choice of Robert Downey Jr. would have been far more entertaining. Opposite Franco, Williams, Weisz and Kunis have more relevance; each with ample screen time and zappy magic that brews towards a fire-and-brimstone finale. While you won't find the Tin Man or Lion or Scarecrow as vital characters, their personification is manifested in short references. Freshly written for the film is the somewhat humorous Finley, a flying monkey voiced by Zack Braff, and the melodramatic China Girl, a porcelain doll voiced by Joey King.All said and done, If Avatar set about reviving the novel use of 3D and Life Of Pi literally blew it out of the water, Oz The Great And Powerful marches forward by celebrating cinema's core ethos of 'Make Believe'. At the short end of the stick, some viewers may find this story lacks the magical impetus of the 1939 original. Then again, Raimi being the true wizard that he is, takes us down a picturesque yellow brick road resonating the fact that it's less about where we are going but more about how we get there.",Oz the Great and Powerful
120,sunznc,"Good story, good acting, some of the CGI was very good.",8,24 March 2013,"A pleasant surprise! I was expecting mind-numbing CGI and no story. However, we do get a good story and another surprise-good acting. I really enjoyed the back story on Oscar (Oz) himself which is the first quarter of the film. It has a very vintage look and I thought that was a nice touch. I also enjoyed the back story on the wicked witches and Glenda the good witch. The sets are very nice, the costumes for some of the characters so-so. The fabric used on the costumes in The Emerald City is much too modern. Leather pants? Brand new corsets? Tsk, everything else is vintage how did the costumers overlook this?What I did not enjoy was the CGI porcelain doll. She herself was very well done in great detail but there were little scenes here and there where she did not match up to the actor's actions. Why talk about this? Well, if CGI is going to be a huge portion of a film, I'm going to talk about it. Just like I would if it were mediocre stop and go action. Some of it works, some of it doesn't. The introduction of the characters, the direction and acting are great. The costumes not always great. Mostly I did enjoy this and wouldn't mine seeing it again.",Oz the Great and Powerful
121,p-jonsson,Should be Oz The Great and Colorful,6,11 August 2013,"I think I have never seen a movie with such (over)saturated and vibrant colors. Well, that is apart from the first few minutes which are in black and white as some tribute to the ""original"" Wizard of Oz movie. Surprisingly enough it works quite well. The sceneries and landscapes are beautiful to watch in just the right fairy-tale style that you would expect from the land of Oz.The story is pretty much a prequel to the original Wizard of Oz story. Something which does not really intrude too much for most part of the movie but becomes painfully obvious in the last couple of scenes. As for the general story it is pretty much okay. It pleased the kids for sure and I would say that is the main goal of this movie. For adults well, as I said it is okay but not really much more.The lead character can be infuriating at times with his ""dubious ethics"" as the blurb words it. Unfortunately he never really manages to convey that likable rascal attitude that one would have hoped for. He somehow just stays a rather bland character with ""dubious ethics"". I think this goes for most of the other main characters as well. Except for the dubious ethics of course which for the other characters are either plain good or totally and without a doubt bad ones.On the whole I would say that the movie was okay but never really reached any higher than that. For a kid it was probably somewhat better than okay. I did enjoy the movie although this was mostly for the unusual and vibrant colorization and the lovely scenery.",Oz the Great and Powerful
122,akshatmahajan,A good prequel,8,18 November 2021,"I was excited for this movie as this movie was back story of some of the characters from The Wizard of Oz (1939) and I can say that I am satisfied with the movie. Yes, the movie cannot match the level of the original but it has it's good moments. The performances by actors and direction was good. The visuals were stunning and there were some surprises which shocked me.I had few problems with this movie. First, the story seemed too dark. The original was also dark story but it was presented in light manner and in other words, proper balance was there. Second, the last act seemed little bit stretched. Movie could have been 20-25 minutes short easily but overall it will not effect your experience.Overall, it was a good prequel for a 82 years old cult classic movie and I hope they make more adaptations using Oz books.",Oz the Great and Powerful
123,doug_park2001,"""I know I'm not the wizard you wanted, but I may just be the wizard you need""",8,6 April 2014,"Repeatedly hearing that it's not very good, I put off watching this for quite a while. While it would be impossible to completely capture the ambiance of the original WIZARD OF OZ, I still found OZ THE GREAT AND POWERFUL to be an enjoyable prequel. Good props and special effects, but it's hard to recreate Munchkinland, the Emerald City, and all the rest without making them seem like mere parodies of their originals. OGP has a solid plot-line, but again, it just needs something more, and I'm not, alas, sure what that something is--more development and explanation of the whole mythos of OZ, with a few flashbacks, perhaps? The makers of this film had a lot to pack into 130 minutes, and some of the scenes are a bit hurried. It may also have been a mistake to echo Dorothy's later plight so closely, with the Wizard following the road to true OZ, picking up cohorts along the way. {Still, the little china girl is quite endearing.} As many have noted, Rachel Weisz truly steals the show as Evanora (the Wicked Witch of the East), who, interestingly enough, turns her sister Theodora (WW of the West, languidly played by Mila Kunis) green by giving her an apple of the same color reminiscent of the fatal fruit in Genesis. There are several other eccentricities of plot like this, and I would have welcomed a few more.Thematically speaking, it's not completely baked, but there's nevertheless a lot to ponder if you're into it: the mirrors and bubblegum hoakum of the ""Wizard"" contrasted with the varying yet authentic powers of the witches, good, evil, and how the knowledge of same can make them what they are, etc. I've noticed a number of complaints about the lack of a truly good central character, but this lack is one of the biggest reasons why I like it. Everyone, not the least of which are the two wicked witches, has attractive, sympathetic qualities, and everyone--most of all, perhaps, the ""Wizard,"" but even Glinda the good witch--has their own little selfish agendas. If these aspects of the film interest you, I recommend reading Gregory Maguire's excellent novel, WICKED: THE LIFE AND TIMES OF THE WICKED WITCH OF THE WEST, if you haven't already.Anyhoo, there are all sorts of reasons for liking and disliking this film, which is a good quality in itself. Although really young children may have some trouble following it, kids of all ages who aren't prone to ruthless over-analysis should enjoy OGP pretty well just for the ride it gives.",Oz the Great and Powerful
124,ayoreinf,"Very beautiful, very charming, and not all that bad at the bottom line",8,10 March 2013,"It's a very charming and cute prequel, with very beautiful setting and cinematography, with three real good acting performances, that is mainly by Rachel Weisz who's as superb as ever, in the hardest role of this movie, and Mila Kunis who does very well as Theodora, both as the wide eyed girl she's playing at the beginning and as the vindictive witch she grows into. Michelle Williams is also very good, but her role is a lot less demanding than the other two leading ladies. And James Franco, well, it's a role I've seen him playing before, and he's once again the charming egotistic con man, but I must say his conversion feels like it's there because it had to be to bring the story to its promised end, it's not heartfelt, maybe because he's too convincing as a con man, maybe because he's not convincing enough as the one who finds his real self to await Dorothy when she'll come. All together it was nice and charming, and the parts that were played well with the setting and the CG that made wonders add up to a nice fairy tale. Considering the fact we can't really have a surprise ending here since it's after all a prequel to a story we're all very familiar with, I think it's a very good bottom line, and I liked it.",Oz the Great and Powerful
125,aramis-112-804880,Comparisons are Odious,6,24 October 2015,"Since ""Oz"" (prequel to ""The Wizard of Oz"") makes so many direct comparisons to the MGM classic, it invites comparisons. Sets like the Emerald City throne room look so much like the MGM version (and the wicked witch seems to be channeling Margaret Hamilton,from the 1939 version), ""Oz"" looks like a worthy successor . . . or predecessor . . . to Judy Garland's classic. And the Winkies are perfect.""Oz"" a lovely movie with lots of wonderful effects. And it explores lots of other areas in Baum's magical lands. Unfortunately, it seems to be more like an Oz travelogue rather than a story. Since we all grew up with the MGM 1939 version, we have a lot of love for it. If we had not grown up with it, the scarecrow, tin man and cowardly lion would probably seem too cutesy to ever be beloved, but we kind of miss them here, since they don't really put in an appearance (though there is a scary lion and men of straw).Most importantly, the cutesy older version had one thing this version lacks: charm. Perhaps our modern world is too jaded to believe in charm. But the 1939 version was made with the backdrop of Depression, the rise of dictators around the world (Hitler, Mussolini, Stalin, FDR) and with World War just around the corner. Yet they managed it. That was the older movie's true magic, and it's too bad the makers of ""Oz"" (who put a lot of good craftsmanship into it) were unable to duplicate that charm. This will never be a beloved classic, only a footnote to one.Spoiler: while ""Oz"" sensibly avoids trying to duplicate the hummable songs of ""The Wizard of Oz"" (with one hilarious exception) they do tack a wannabe hit onto the closing credits. Avoid it.",Oz the Great and Powerful
126,galahad58-1,Oz the Decent and Nostalgic,6,9 March 2013,"Oz is not your typical Sam Raimi film. Oz lacks Raimi's usual flair and character that are present in his past movies and it lacks the humor that usually would lace his films. Oz tries so hard to remind you of the Wizard of Oz that that becomes the biggest negative of the film. It was an interesting concept, that Raimi had, to try and tie it in with the original movie, but that concept left it limited to what the film could do.The acting is laughable--and not in a good way. Raimi takes a bunch of poor to very average actors and has them ""try"" and overact reminiscent of the 1930s. Rachel Weisz and Mila Kunis (who are not great actresses) just come off as ridiculous. James Franco at least is half-decent, but not great. The surrounding characters (monkey, china girl, tinkers, etc) carry the movie to it's conclusion and keep it from being a complete mess.This is a film that is for the very young or those looking to relive their childhood memories of The Wizard of Oz. Too bad it could not have lived up to the rest of Raimi's work.",Oz the Great and Powerful
127,gregeichelberger,"'Oz' prequel heartfelt, but pales next to the original",6,8 March 2013,"Any movie fan worth his or her salt has to realize that 1939 was no doubt the greatest year in cinematic history.Such releases as ""Gone With the Wind,"" ""Stagecoach,"" ""Mr. Smith Goes To Washington,"" ""Ninotchka,"" ""Of Mice and Men,"" ""Goodbye, Mr. Chips,"" ""Dark Victory,"" ""Love Affair"" (later remade as ""An Affair To Remember,""), ""Wuthering Heights,"" ""Jesse James,"" ""The Women,"" ""The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,"" ""Babes In Arms,"" ""Destry Rides Again,"" ""The Four Feathers,"" ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame,"" ""The Hound of the Baskervilles,"" ""Jaurez"" and ""The Little Princess,"" among others, made their debuts and have since gone on to become classics of the industry.With all of those great and near-great films, however, the favorite of mine has always been the Victor Fleming-directed musical/fantasy ""The Wizard of Oz,"" a truly perfect 10-star motion picture that incorporates fun, adventure, genuine scares, comedy, wonderful songs and a message that ""there is no place like home."" It's a movie that made Judy Garland a star (and won her a special juvenile Academy Award) and placed tunes such as ""Follow the Yellow Brick Road,"" ""If I Only Had a Brain,"" ""Ding Dong, the Witch Is Dead"" and ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" into our musical lexicon.The film was also named the most-watched motion picture in history by the Library of Congress, is often ranked among the Top 10 best movies of all-time in various critics' and popular polls, and is the source of many memorable quotes referenced in modern popular culture (""I'll get you, my pretty, and you're little dog, too,"" among them).Now, from the director of the original (and still the best) ""Spider-Man,"" Sam Raimi, and writers Mitchell Kapner (""Romeo Must Die"") and David Lindsay-Abaire (""Rise of the Guardians,"" ""Rabbithole"") comes a prequel based upon the L. Frank Baum stories written in the early 20th century and brought to the big screen several times before the 1939 classic.""The Great and Powerful Oz"" looks very good, has a stellar cast (including Oscar winner Rachel Weisz, and nominees Michelle Williams and James Franco - in the title role; also joining the fun is Zach Braff from ""Scrubs,"" and Mila Kunis of ""Ted"" and ""The Family Guy"") and wonderful makeup (Georgia Allen, ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,"" ""The Avengers"") and special effects (Eric and John Frazier, ""The Amazing Spider-Man,"" ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"").What it does not have, though, among other things are Judy Garland, Frank Morgan, Margaret Hamilton, Billie Burke, Bert Lahr, Jack Haley, Ray Bolger and memorable tunes. It's not the fault of Danny Elfman, but after the hearing the original score, nothing could come close (just ask the Bee Gees, who tried to replace the Beatles in ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"").And coming in at more than $200 million (a budget 200 times that of the original), there was certainly no expense spared and - visually - it looks it. It may actually earn more than its more famous sequel (which only brought in about $3 million in its initial release), but will certainly never replace ""The Wizard of Oz"" in most people's hearts, especially this particular critic's.This version doesn't want to be a good film, but a great one. Unfortunately, that slot was filled 74 years ago. There's plenty of brains here, heart and courage, however, are a bit lacking.Neither great, nor powerful, the plot has Oscar Diggs (Franco) a small-time magician in a Kansas traveling circus in 1905, eking out a miserable existence as a charlatan and a philandering con man. Mistreating his assistant (Braff) and cheating his audience with cheap parlor tricks, he's suddenly swept away to the Land of Oz via a hot air balloon - and a twister (just as Dorthy had been).Here, he meets familiar faces, as well as new friends (and enemies), including sisters Theodora (Kunis) and Evanora (Weisz), as well as Glinda (Williams), a sweet little China doll (voice of Joey King, ""The Dark Knight Rises"") and a flying monkey (Braff). Enlisted by the oppressed peoples (a more politically-correct group than the 1939 version) and Munchkins (led by Tony Cox) to combat the evil witches, he - at first - shirks his duty and tries to flee.Glinda and others, however, see the good in him and persuade him to truly be the great (and powerful) wizard he was destined to be. Action borrows from the hit Broadway play, ""Wicked,"" as well, and more than sets up the situation where Dorothy will appear years later.""Oz,"" like its predecessor, begins in black-and-white sepia-tone for the Kansas scenes, then turns into a world of Technacolor wonder, but the 3D technology is not really necessary, and the CGI effects only show what an amazing job the original artists did with no computers at the time.And while certainly a bold attempt that features the required amount of laughs, pathos, thrills and entertainment, many will likely want to view ""The Wizard of Oz,"" if for nothing else, to complete the saga - and to enjoy one of the truly great motion pictures while one is at it.",Oz the Great and Powerful
128,nesfilmreviews,Visually entertaining.,6,7 June 2013,"""Oz the Great and Powerful"" manages to continue the spirit of its legendary predecessor, marked with darkness and tension—and it's an enjoyable to watch for the visual effects alone. The film contains many nods to the original ""The Wizard of Oz"" (1939), without it feeling forced or taking away from the story at hand. The film acknowledges the moments for those with a fondness for the childhood classic. It is a relatively faithful remake, but comes up short on surprises for a truly, memorable adventure.The film starts off in black & white as we are introduced to Oz (James Franco), ho- hum life as a magician traveling with the ""Baum Brothers"" circus. One day, while escaping in a hot air balloon from an enraged strongman, Oz is caught in a tornado and deposited in Oz. Color now enters the world after landing into this new magical land; and when he gets there, it certainly does come to life. Oscar's arrival is afforded with full color, widescreen treatment by Raimi and his band of CGI landscapers. Though garishly convincing, the world of Oz lacks the 'wow' factor of James Cameron's ""Avatar"" (2009). Once there, meets the witch Theodora (Mila Kunis), who believes he represents the fulfillment of a prophecy made by the late king. She escorts Oz to Emerald City, where he meets Theodora's sister, Evanora (Rachel Weisz). In order to claim the throne, however, he must travel into the Dark Forest and kill the Wicked Witch. James Franco is fine as our protagonist this film, for the most part. Oscar comes across more as a sleazy opportunist--a man conflicted with his inner-demons. His charm and cocky attitude-works well in this film-as he is forced to politely lie and muddle his way through the adventure. Fortunately, the performances by the witches are more entertaining, but to discuss any of the three characters in any detail might spoil what few surprises are to be had. The latter half of the film in particular is dominated by the trio, and thankfully so. Weisz and Williams are fitting as Evanora and Glinda--but it is Mila Kunis, who truly comes to dominate the film with her commanding performance as Theodora.It is largely an entertaining piece of eye candy that goes on longer than it should. It benefits from having a director who brings energy, humor, and emotion to what could have been a soulless exercise, much like ""Alice in Wonderland"" (2010). ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" was never going to hit the same heights as the 1939 classic, nor was it ever fair to expect or presume it to do so. It is a film decidedly of its era, and while it is quite the spectacle, the present-day nature of the CGI effects means it will likely become dated and overlooked relatively quickly.",Oz the Great and Powerful
129,Chalice_Of_Evil,Where's Hansel & Gretel when you need them?...,7,7 March 2013,"I admit I hadn't really known much about this movie (such as what the story was about and who was playing who) until recently. Though I did find out before going to see it and, well, I think you'd be better off going into this film knowing very little about it. I've seen numerous complaints about the 'spoiling' of Theodora (Mila Kunis) turning out to be The Wicked Witch of the West, but in hindsight, the signs are all clearly there. Her big floppy hat, for one (which deserves its own credit). Then there's her voice, that you just KNOW is going to turn into that classic evil witchy cackle - which she does plenty of. Lastly, her conversation with her sister, Evanora (Rachel Weisz - who deserves all the praise she's getting, as she really *does* have fun in the role and is one of the stand-out performances), is about as subtle as a train wreck. Theodora insists she's NOT 'wicked' (a word you'll hear a plenty of throughout the film) and then promptly tosses a fireball. What ultimately turns her evil? Thinking she was the 'one and only' witch for Oz (James Franco), then believing she's but *one* of his 'one and only's, thanks to her sister's deceit. Yes, it's one of THOSE origin stories. I'd actually originally thought Weisz would turn into the Wicked Witch, back when all I knew about the movie was who was starring in it. Then once I read a bit of info about the film, it became clear this wasn't the case. Maybe the movie would have benefited from her being cast in the role? Kunis does a good witch cackle, and certainly looks the part - all greened up, pointy hat and broom-flying - but ultimately, she doesn't really convey that much...well..'wickedness'. Probably the nicest/most subtle touch was her streaking tears burning her cheeks.Those hoping for an origin story that has lots of depth and substance may find this a bit disappointing. Theodora meets Oz when he crash-lands in the wondrous realm of Oz, and within a very brief amount of time, is already infatuated with him (of course, she believes he really *is* a wizard with actual powers, so that probably has something to do with it). I didn't mind Mila when she was skipping merrily along The Yellow Brick Road, despite her naivety, but there just wasn't enough time spent developing a real solid attachment between her and Oz before she descends into villain territory. Given the overlong runtime of the film, more of it should have been devoted to their burgeoning relationship, I think. It's hard to believe Weisz wasn't Raimi's/the studio's first choice for Evanora, as she plays her perfectly. She and Glinda (Michelle Williams) have quite the witch battle at the end. The real crime here is Evanora's punishment she suffers at the end - as robbing Rachel Weisz of her beauty is just not on! I guess it does set her up to become a future pancake underneath Dorothy's house, though. Williams as Glinda is kind and sweet and floats around in a bubble (though that's apparently just for show) and has a crown that never falls off. She can also take a hit or two and manage to bounce back after Evanora goes all Emperor on her arse, zapping her with green lightning shooting from her fingertips. Williams' Glinda is fine, if not particularly interesting/memorable. The last we see of the two Wicked Witches does suggest that this may be set-up for sequels to come...or, if not, then it serves as simply a prequel to the two already existing 'Oz' films.Kunis's Theordora utters the words 'how predictable' at one point in the film, and that really could apply to the movie as a whole. It's not exactly a story you haven't seen before. There's Oz, who pretends to be a great magician, but really just uses cheap tricks. When he comes to the Land of Oz, he is of course mistaken for a real wizard. There's the expected self-doubt, then the bit where he makes everyone thinks he really is a coward, only to reveal himself to have turned noble in the end and save everyone. Nothing new to see here. Franco is adequate in the role, though his grin really makes you want to punch him in the face at times. He's also somewhat overshadowed by the witches. At least Oz's career in illusion comes in handy at the end - even if it's a bit hard to believe that such powerful witches are so easily fooled and give in so quickly. Zach Braff is Oz's offsider, both in Kansas and in the Land Of Oz - although, in the latter he is a flying monkey valet. He is intended as the film's main source of comic relief, and he has his moments. While there is some humour in the film, it's not exactly big on laughs. Joey King, meanwhile, does tug at the heartstrings as a girl in a wheelchair who asks Oz to make her walk, when she's seeing his performance. She also provides the voice for China Girl - a wonderfully brought to life creation...that sadly verges on the irritating, personality-wise. So much damn crying! And that must have been some fast-acting glue Oz had on him that he used to put her back together.Starting the film in black & white and a vintage aspect ratio does help set the tone of the film, plus it creates that nostalgic feel for the classic original film. The visuals are quite stunning, but after a while the novelty wears off. Visuals can't make up for a lacklustre story, and sadly, despite the direction/look of the film and some good performances, Oz the Great and Powerful just doesn't quite live up to its title. In the end, it's good...but not great.",Oz the Great and Powerful
130,carlos37andre,What a piece of sh#t!,3,28 July 2017,"MY GOOOD! I can believe they did that.I don't even know where to start. This movie is incredibly able to have worse effects than the one of 1939. It is worse than the Star Wars prequel's. Most of the CGI is without details and without life (except for the Porcelain Doll), it seems even a lazy production, EVEN THE TREES ARE MADE WITH GRAPHIC COMPUTING! WHY?! WHYYY?!That wouldn't be such a big problem if the movie was good, but that's not the case. From the beginning the movie tries to take the nostalgia of the original. For example, in the beginning, that just like the iconic 39's movie starts without colors and only when we get to Oz do they appear. However, even on that the film fails, starting with the black and white image, when the original is brown and white. From then on several forced citations and small references are played during the movie to perhaps make you care (like the various references to Scarecrows).That said, let's look at the story itself, without considering that this thing tries to serve as a prequel to the work of art that was launched in the 1930s. The plot (if you can call it a plot) is confusing and things do not seem to happen for any particular reason, the perfect example of this is the transformation of ""Theodora"" into ""Wicked Witch."" The goal is to look like she had a broken heart, so she decided to turn bad once (eating an apple? Really?), That would even work, but how long had she interacted with the Magician? 2 DAYS?! And how can she be that stupid? How can everyone in the city be so dumb, to spend decades on the command of a tyrant and evil Witch and not realize? Look, I know it's a fantastic world, I know that even the original follows very basic premises of fantasy and that being too critical isn't very correct, but to me that's lazy to try to make a minimally coherent story, not a complex story, just a coherent one.I'm going to skip the bad performances (James Franco), not to mention that only ridiculous things surround the movie, there are three cool things worth highlighting (but they do not change the quality of the movie very much, nor do they make it worth your time).It is clear that every single scene Mila Kunis is trying to do something cool, and from the moment she becomes the Wicked Witch of the West, for me, she delivers a performance that lives up to the original, with the character's striking features.The final ""battle"", when it is shown the great trick that Oz planned is a good scene, it seems something the original Wizard would do, even though it is a predictable scene, it is good. Pay attention, this scene is good, the """"""battle"""""" of the two Witch's after that isn't.And finally, by far the best thing in the movie: Michelle Williams. She is simply fantastic as Glinda, every moment she appears on the scene no one else matters, it's amazing how she managed to do something extremely faithful to Billie Burke's performance, and at the same time add something more to this character that doesn't appear much in the first movie. Amazing! Wonderful! Beautiful! But that's it, she's the only great thing in the whole movie.OH! One more thing I remembered: DO YOU REALLY NEED TO EXPLAIN THE F#CKING BROOM ?! Seriously?!",Oz the Great and Powerful
131,kevinxirau,Great and powerful indeed.,8,1 April 2013,"Who can forget one of the greatest films of all time, ""The Wizard of Oz""? No one, that's who! Based on a series of books, the adventures of Dorothy and her friends have captured the imagination of audiences of all ages throughout the years. This time, however, Sam Raimi brings the idea of how Oz himself came into this magical world of Munchkins, witches, and talking animals and basically how the Witches of the East and West became ever so wicked. This is Oz: The Great and Powerful.About twenty years before Dorothy set foot in the Land of Oz, there was a stage magician and womanizing con artist named Oscar ""Oz"" Diggs (James Franco) who was riding a hot-air balloon when a freakish tornado sucks him into the mystical land that bears his name. Assumed a wizard by the cheerful locals, Oz finds himself a golden opportunity for wealth and power, but fate has a different plan in mind as two witches (Rachel Weisz and Mila Kunis) are rising to power and threaten to take over the entire kingdom. With the help of a talking flying monkey named Finley (Zach Braff), a charming little China Girl (Joey King), and Glinda the Good Witch of the South (Michelle Williams), Oz must unite the peoples of the land with his ingenuity and along they way learn what it really means to be great.I really love the idea of a guy who uses parlor tricks who is suddenly faced with beings who use real magic and must find a way to deal with them. That has a lot of potential and this movie took full advantage of it. Sam Raimi was very faithful to the original film as there are so many elements of the ""The Wizard of Oz"" used in this prequel that dedicated fans will instantly recognize. The land of Oz looks amazing, looking very much the same right down to the Yellow Brick Road with, of course, some updates and the special effects are a sight to behold. Seeing the characters like Oz and the Wicked Witch of the West before they became who they were destined to be was really interesting. I also love the climax, which was done so spectacularly that it left a large smile on my face.The cast did pretty good in their roles. James Franco as Oz does seem like an unlikable, egotistical jerk throughout the first half, but his development into the ""great and powerful"" wizard he was destined to be was done quite well and thus he becomes more likable. Mila Kunis as Theodora (Wicked Witch of the West), while a somewhat odd casting choice, did a nice job showing the journey of one of the most memorable movie villains of all time and Rachel Weisz as Evanora (Wicked Witch of the East) is a great villain, powerful and manipulative. Michelle Williams pretty much nailed the core character of Glinda, a wise and benevolent witch, and Zach Braff as Fineley the monkey has some funny moments. To me, the most memorable character was Joey King as the China Girl, who seriously pulled some major heartstrings. I felt myself emotionally invested in the scenes involving her as she is so charming and sympathetic that you would wanna give her a hug. Such a well-done performance.With great visuals, great characters, great story, and great cameos, this movie is very entertaining and sure to please the viewers. While obviously not as fun and timeless as the original film, I definitely recommend this so check it out!",Oz the Great and Powerful
132,Tcarts76,Like every James Franco movie...wait till it comes on TV,4,5 June 2013,"Oz the Great and powerful is a failure of a prequel to the original classic, ""The Wizard of Oz.""I appreciate the way they tried to adhere somewhat to the corniness of the original 1939 movie, but please, enough already. James Franco is the same character he always plays, the good looking guy who is just annoying enough to not be a real movie star. The story itself is just OK. And how do you take a beautiful actress like Mila Kunis and make her look just blah for half the film and then hide her behind a bad special effects make-up job for the other half of the film.Michelle Williams is a beautiful girl in this film as she usually is but a humdrum, run of the mill 1940's script can't make her a superstar in this one either. Whoever chose to make this film...well scratch that, whoever decided to FUND this film should have fired the director and script writers after the first day of shooting. This was way to big of a project to fall so flat on, and I don't even appreciate the effort.I can't believe they got Rachel Weisz to sign on to this sign of the apocalypse, but they did. Much like the other actors, she couldn't polish a turd either. In fact her character and Mila's could have done the film a huge favor and swapped roles, it would have helped, but hey, Hollywood is about selling tickets to see a movie, not actually making a good movie. The only thing that could have made this one even worse is if they would have landed Leonardo DiCaprio...Your best bet is to wait for this to come on TV (with any luck it never will). Don't waste money on it, in fact never watch a James Franco movie again.

133,Avwillfan89,The visuals and Rachel Weiz are the only good things,5,6 May 2021,"Probably the most impressive parts of the film is both the change from black and white to colour and the change in ratio when Oz flies to the magical land in his hot air balloon.Other than the visuals and Rachel Weiz's eccentric performance, the film was largely disappointing. I haven't seen the musical Wicked, but way in which the Wicked Witch of The West came to be appeared to be far more three dimentional and entertaining that this one offered.James Franco is terribly miscast in this film. Although the character is meant to be a charismatic con-man - with Franco in the role, he just comes off as both sleazy and douchy, especially at the very end when he tricks Glinda into coming in his booth behind the curtain so he can give her a kiss. It also doesn't help to know that the actor has been accused of sexual misconduct by some of his former students. I did not find him appealing at all.Raimi can do brilliant visuals, eccentric, goofy scenes and terrifying horror very well. Those elements mix well together, but sadly the script just fell flat.",Oz the Great and Powerful
134,PCC0921,Old vs new.,8,6 October 2020,"Everyone and their mother, grandmother and great grandmother has seen the Wizard of Oz (1939). Old, young, male, female, teacher, student, princess, nerd, librarian or even biker-dude has seen WOZ. Let me get this part out first. See ""Oz, the Great and Powerful"". It is fun and funny. Yes, the CGI is amazing and the 3D effects are great too. Mila Kunis does do well. It was a nice try that Sam Raimi attempted trying to make her scary, but not possible. She is too cute.Anyway, Director Sam Raimi, (Spiderman trilogy, Evil Dead trilogy, The Quick and the Dead (1995), who I am a huge fan of, does a great job of connecting with the original film by allowing us to see images that remind us of it (B&W to color thing, the yellow brick road, the image of Oz projecting his image on smoke to fool the people of Oz, etc.). You usually don't go wrong when Sam Raimi is involved. Now, here is where it got weird. The debate where splash and CGI has pulled great acting, dialogue and plot away from movies does rear its ugly head in this. At least on three occasions I was laughing at the silly dialogue and acting, not because it was good or funny, but because it sounded silly and at some points idiotic. As you are force fed a feast of beautiful CGI effects you can feel an underlying sense of plasticity, lack of charm and an overabundance of staleness throughout the film. When I watch the original WOZ, either at age 5, 25 or 45, I still feel the same feelings, emotions and charm emanating from the film. When viewing this film, you can feel the artificial or stepford-ness emanating from it. There is no charm. There is no emotion. It is just a CGI smorgasbord. Does it match up well against the original? No way? Not on your life. Am I going to badmouth Sam Raimi? No way! As a CGI spectacle it is beautiful to see. Did James Franco, Mila Kunis and Rachel Weisz fill the acting-shoes of Judy Garland, Margaret Hamilton and Ray Bulger? Not in a million years, but that is not a knock on them, because they are very talented 21st century thespians.As I said, it still was a fun film to watch, but there is something that has been lost. It has been my practice of writing reviews that I will grade on a curve, but usually it applies to older films with lower budgets, or low budget or independent films or even foreign films, because they usually have smaller budgets. I always felt that grading on a curve, based on a film's budget is fair, because it usually is not something a film-maker can control and more money does equal higher quality, but for some reason I feel compelled to go the other way on this and grade on a curve for a film that has too high a budget. I really want to give this film a B-, but sometimes the debate and discussion and the structure and impact of a film makes it even more interesting than the film itself and I have a feeling that 25 years down the road this film and the original will become film school debate fodder, so as a whole combined piece I have to give it a B.8.1 (B MyGrade)",Oz the Great and Powerful
135,haterofcrap,Great film,10,19 March 2013,"Sam Raimi never disappoints, and this movie isn't exception of that rule: This magical and highly enjoyable film has all the charm from the 1939 classic, being a great tribute to that movie from beginning to end.While some viewers dislike the visual style used in this movie, I think it was fantastic. Probably not at the same level of masterpieces like Avatar, but it does has the colorful, almost dream-like beauty that made the 1939 one of the most beloved fantasy films ever made. James Franco makes here a very funny and charming performance as the titular character, resulting in a film very entertaining to watch, despite the slight predictability of the plot (After all, being some sort of prequel of the 1939 classic, it is quite obvious how things are going to end)My recommendation to the viewers who are going to watch this movie is to don't expect it to be like ""Wicked"" (A great musical, but the story is unrelated to the books and movies) Instead of that, expect a nice homage to the Judy Garland movie (Even when this isn't a musical)",Oz the Great and Powerful
136,blacklist-1,"An overall fun and magical ride into the world of Oz, but it does unfortunately stumble as he shows he really isn't that great.",8,12 April 2013,"Oz the Great and Powerful is superbly directed by Sam Raimi adding another overall great film to his fairly successful movie directing career. He gave me two hours of pure entertainment that never felt dragged out or overstretched. It starts out in Kansas 1905, in black and white (a wonderful homage to the 1939 classic with Judy Garland) with Oz (James Franco) a failing small time Magician who ends up in the colourful world of Oz. Mistaken for the actual wizard in a foretold prophecy of being the saviour that would rid the world of the Wicked Witch, he has to use his bag of ""tricks"" to convince the inhabitants he is who he says he is and rid the world of the Wicked Witch. Along the way he encounters characters such as Theodora (Mila Kunis), Evanora (Rachel Weisz), Anna/Glinda (Michelle Williams) and has two faithful sidekicks Finley, a monkey voiced by Zach Braff and China Girl (Zoey King) Where the film really takes off is when Oz lands in the enchanted world and the film changes to colour. Raimi and the production team pull out all the stops in making this world come to life with a feast for the eyes with the superb CGI. The production values are top notch, some of the best effects I've seen, with really great 3D throughout too. While the film has lots of style, it also has funny moments within the script particularly with the monkey Finley. I just wish there had been some with Oz.The fundamental failing of this film, which others have rightfully pointed out is the leading performance by James Franco. I don't mean to be harsh as he is a great actor and has pulled off some terrific performances in other roles. But Oz is one of his worst. He tries too hard to act throughout to be funny and lacks any charm or grace, which this role required. It was quite frankly embarrassing to watch particularly in moments when he smiles, which is meant to be charming, but no offence came across as forced and creepy. Even my father who is easier to impress than me didn't like Franco's performance. Ironically Franco wasn't the first given choice with this role with both Robert Downey Jr and Johnny Depp being offered the parts, which they turned down. They would have been far better as Oz. Not to mention it doesn't work in his favour when the script has his character treating the women around him badly and he gets away with it, without any redemption or anything. Boys will be boys I suppose, but not really a message that should be sent out to kids. I didn't hate Oz's character, but I didn't like him either.Thankfully the rest of the cast, the three female leads and Oz's two sidekicks deliver excellent performances, which covers up Franco's awful one. Williams and in particular Kunis and Weisz revel in their roles and it's fun trying to work out which one of them is the Wicked Witch. Zach Braff does a wonderful voice-over job as Finley and makes the character enjoyable and entertaining to watch (he gets the best comedy moments) and the young actress Zoey King delivers an endearing voice-over performance as China Girl perfectly capturing the character's warmth and vulnerability.With a more capable leading actor Oz the Great and Powerful could have been really Great, but the four female performances and Braff's acting along with the terrific CGI and 3D makes this an overall magical and fun ride for the whole family. I thoroughly enjoyed it.",Oz the Great and Powerful
137,lotekguy-1,"Looks Great, Less Filling",5,7 March 2013,"This overlong prequel to the classic Wizard of Oz offers much to admire, but more to regret. Its new screenplay gives us the backstory on how the Wizard wound up there before Dorothy blew into town for her famous adventure. With the resources of the Disney empire and Sam Raimi at the helm, one might expect another fantasy for the ages. One would be severely disappointed.James Franco stars as Oz, a cheesy magician in a seedy little traveling carnival in 1905 Kansas. He has no scruples about conning the rubes, or trying to seduce the local lovelies. While fleeing from an irate husband in a hot air balloon, a tornado swoops him up to the not-so-merry old land of Oz, where he's believed to be the wizard of prophesy to free the kingdom from the clutches of an evil witch. As in the original, the Kansas setup is filmed in black & white, creating a stunning contrast when he reaches the colorful splendor of the main action.The place is up for grabs among three witchy sisters (Rachel Weisz, Mila Kunis, Michelle Williams) who are variably good or wicked. One kilt their pa, the kindly king who is mourned by the nice folk of the land. This ""wizard"" is actually more cowardly than Bert Lahr's lion; and whatever heart he may have beyond Jack Haley's Tin Man is dwarfed by his avarice.The visuals are truly spectacular - especially in the climactic confrontation sequence. 3-D is highly advisable. But there's not enough meat in the script for well over two hours of running time. Besides that, Franco mugs his way through the worst performance of his career, other than last year's dreadful job of co-hosting The Oscars.Raimi has deftly combined mayhem - large-scale and small - with sharp humor in a slew of films, from his early horror flicks, to The Quick and the Dead (slightly surreal western) to at least two of his three Spiderman blockbusters. His Evil Dead II includes my all-time favorite cinematic sight gag. Other than a quick in-joke with his pal Bruce Campbell, there's little of Raimi's wit in evidence. One might assume the Disney honchos kept him on a short leash. Much of the film gives the impression of setting up the framework for a theme park attraction, rather than making the best film their available assets could yield.Parents should be aware that this is a darker, scarier adventure than Judy Garland's journey, with less offsetting cuteness and music. It could easily have been rated PG-13. Keep that in mind, along with relative attention-spans, when deciding which kids to bring or (perhaps better) send to this movie.Where were Tim Burton, Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham-Carter when they were needed?",Oz the Great and Powerful

139,tapio_hietamaki,An okay fantasy adventure,6,21 March 2013,"Made as a companion film to the classic Wizard of Oz (1939), this colorful fantasy adventure largely relies on CGI graphics and nostalgia throwbacks to the classic film. If you want to see ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" I'd say Wizard of Oz isn't really required to see beforehand, as the imagery is familiar with pretty much everyone anyway (the evil flying baboons, the green Wicked Witch, the yellow brick road.)The film has VERY cheesy dialog, with cringe-worthy lines delivered so spectacularly over the top that it's quite funny, actually. Sam Raimi gives us a lot of self-parody and the actors chew the scenery. Well, the little China Doll delivers a somewhat believable, emotional performance, and Zach Braff is trustworthy as always. It's just a shame that instead of his face we have to look at a CGI monkey. (The CGI looked a little plastic-y and the colors were almost too vibrant at times.) There's a good reason to see this in cinema, though - the scene where the format changes to widescreen and the colors appear. That was a truly magical moment. Actually, the film was at its best at the black-and-white beginning when it was focused on characterization and plot. When we get to the wonderland the film loses heart.Oh, and Mila Kunis looks absolutely gorgeous here.",Oz the Great and Powerful
140,lucasnochez,Oz the Great and Powerful-One needs to be good before they can be great,5,8 March 2013,"Ever since my love for film sprang to life in the form of Christopher Nolan's Memento in 2000, I have been dreading the moment that I would have to publicly, and in print, come out and say that the 1939 feature film version of L. Frank Baum's children's stories The Wizard of Oz was by no means a favourite of mine.Made 48 years after the year of my birth, the American classic is undoubtedly an achievement in style, form and film especially knowing that the cinematic venture had four directors attached to it at one time, a slew of production issues and inexplicable disasters. Today, 74-years after the original American classic, Disney has decided to carefully deliver a prequel to audience members and their grandparents without many lions, or tigers or bears, or ruby slippers or chin moles, oh my! Nearly a decade ago, Disney decided to adapt a film from a amusement park ride in the form of Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. Fast forward ten years, and now Disney is doing the opposite and trying to make a feature film an elaborately lush, often cheesy and nauseating roller-coaster type film in the form of Oz the Great and Powerful. But just like any other roller coaster, Oz the Great and Powerful does have its fun and amusing moments. Starting in the same fashion of the original film, Oz the Great and Powerful shines in glorious black and white. Introducing us to Oscar Diggs (James Franco) in tributing 4:3 Academy ratio then to a 16:9 widescreen ratio once Diggs enters the magical land of Oz, director Sam Raimi and his team gets it right at first. But as the land of Oz begins to widen and its characters, as well as Diggs' journey, begins to unfold, somewhere over the rainbow is where the story and movie looses so much of its magic.Franco plays Oscar Zoroaster Phadrig Issac Norman Henkel Emmannuel Ambroise Diggs, small time magician in a moving circus, con-artist and 20th Century playboy. After playing a routine show with his trusty and undervalued sidekick Frank -Zach Braff-, Oscar gets a surprise visit from a former flame Annie -Michelle Williams- informing him of her engagement. Sentimental and vulnerable, Oscar is chased away from the circus on a hot-air balloon where he is faced off against an angry twister and sent in to the colourful world of Oz. Rich and saturated with colour, Oz fatefully introduced Oscar to Theodora -Mila Kunis- and is brought to speed about the prophecy of a great and powerful wizard appearing out of thin air to the land to free them from the evil witch. Skeptical at first, before knowing of his inheritance in gold thanks to his adviser Evanora Rachel Weisz, Oscar's agrees to rid of the evil witch. Aided by an unusual team of friends, Finley, a monkey with wings, voiced by sidekick Zach Braff again, and China Girl -Joey King- as well as the Glinda The Good Witch Michelle Williams, Oscar, simply a man in a fantastical world, is faced with his greatest con yet. There is no denying the enchantingly entertaining spirit of Oz the Great and Powerful. Screenwriters Mitchell Kapner and Robert Lindsay-Abaire tried so very hard to keep the spirit alive from Braun's literature and the original feature film. But where the film lacks in spirit and true spell-binding beauty it makes up for in CGI-laden set designs and characters. It is quite a shame to think that the most emotionally involving and manipulating instances of the film revolved around Finley and China girl, two CGI-derived characters. Although the film really feels authentic and one may get lost in the first black and white act, one becomes a bit distracted with the constant objects shooting out of the small 4:3 ratio frame repeatedly. It seems like Disney has yet to find a film where they can exercise Real D 3D in moderation. But one must not forget the origins of the man who was at the helm of Oz the Great and Powerful, Sam Raimi. A masterclass in camp and B-films, Raimi was the man responsible for the lowest AND highest points for Spider-Man on film as well as the cheap and campy Evil Dead trilogy. In true original fashion, Raimi never strays away from the cheap thrills, clichéd one- liners, and narrative predictability. Raimi and his crew tried so hard to find the magic of its predecessor but must be soon realizing that there is no place like home, especially given his success in the horror genre with his last entry Drag Me To Hell. Connecting the small dose of the real black and white world with the colourful world of Oz, Disney tried to revive magical movie moments and true instances of nostalgia with foreshadowing and obvious symbolism without any real payoff. It too bad, recalling now that throughout Oz the Great and Powerful, Franco's Diggs wanted nothing more than to be great and memorable; ""The only thing better than greatnessis goodness"" recites Williams' character Glinda. Unfortunately, no one at Disney got the memo to follow their own advice, which makes this forced and money-grabbing prequel nothing to marvel at.",Oz the Great and Powerful
141,CMTiago,Mostly an effects extravaganza.,7,21 March 2014,"I want to start by saying that this movie has a very predictable plot line, but then again if you're familiar with The Wizard Of Oz, you by now know the aftermath of the previous story. My complain, though, is the fact that the film itself doesn't provide enough doubt. It is an entertaining ride, yet at one point you have figured out how the scenes are going to play out. In the end this is basic canon and the safe way to tell the story. Despite these setbacks, there is room for the technical work to shine, as both cinematography and visual effects look beautiful like there supposed to. As far as performances go I can say that I am not disappointed and that all of the protagonists did their part well. When it comes to a close, Oz The Great & Powerful proves itself as a fun movie experience and an efficient background to the mysterious wizard. Nonetheless, it fails to bring anything else to the table and leaves you with no meaning to the story.

It attempts to be kidult entertainment but fails both audiences.As a morality tale, it's confused. Oscar's redemption at the end is unconvincing. As for Frank/Finley claiming that friendship was all he'd wanted all along? Yes, friendship with a self-obsessed, womanizing huckster? Ahem! No, what he needed was therapy and to choose his friends more wisely.The characterizations are one-note, one-dimensional. James Franco is dislikeable. Michelle Williams plays it like a cartoon goodie-goodie in a bad wig. Rachel Weisz and Mila Kunis are two ""sisters"" who couldn't even be bothered to co-ordinate their vastly differing accents. Just plain lazy.One of those films where you're a third of the way in and find yourself watching the clock and willing it to end. I didn't enjoy it. I thought it was rubbish.

143,jaxbubba,Not so Great and Not so Powerful,4,15 April 2013,"After hearing all the poor reviews of this film, I was not looking forward to seeing this movie. Even more so, when the first 90 minutes of this film was basically a scene for scene re-telling of the 1939 original, complete with black & white opening sequence, and people from the opening sequence being place throughout the colorized segment of the film (i.e. - Zach Braff as monkey boy, Joey King as China Girl, and Michelle Williams as Glinda). The film only became interesting in the movie's built up to it's climatic conclusion, the epic battle of GOOD vs EVIL in which the Emerald City and the well- being of all the people of Oz are at stake. The question that you have to be asking yourself, is thirty (30) mins of a two hour film worth investing my time and energy; and I would probably have to say, no it is not!!!If the cinematography of this film was mesmerizing, and Oz was was like Pandora in Avatar, something beautiful to behold, then maybe that could be a saving grace for this film. However, it's not. The actors are readily identifiable as walking in front of a 'green screen' and the Disney animation easily compares to the 1946 animation of 'Song of the South'. It's really that archaic and bad. After Sam Raimi's success with CGI in his Spider- Man trilogy, the folks at Disney should be irate, embarrassed, and ashamed. However, the new Oz Waterpark ride looks like it will be amazing!!!The actors of this film added even less to this production. Not being a huge James Franco fan, his role as Oz has done nothing to change my opinion of his acting. Mila Kunis (Theodora) and Rachel Wiesz (Evanora) did their best with what they had to work with. While Zach Braff was his stereotypical self, though most of his role was voice over for flying monkey boy, Finley.All in all, this film is was actually not the epic failure of say 'John Carter'; however, it was pretty close. I can only hope and pray that J.J. Abrams outsources his CGI animation requirements for the upcoming Star Wars VII film or we may be in a world of Jar Jar Binks. Not a great film, nor a good one either; my biggest fear right now is that it may be my next in-flight movie on my next trip home... Talk about being afraid to fly!!! If you still feel the need to see this film, I would highly recommend waiting for it's DVD release or On Demand.

145,cnycitylady,A lot like Wonderland...,6,18 March 2013,"Oz: The Great and Powerful is not as bad as a prequel to The Wizard of Oz has every right to be, but it is also not a masterpiece. The movie tells the story of the man Oz, who comes to the land of Oz and becomes the Man we all know and hate in Dorothy's story. But this movie goes in the same direction of the original, starting in Kansas with a character who wants more out of life, and citizens and friends of his who will later embody the characters and people of Oz. The black and white is very nostalgic but not as poetic as it was in the Wizard of Oz. Once there the land is magical and wondrous, but it resembles Wonderland more than Oz. There are odd creatures around every corner and none of the plain, simple life that is Conveyed in the 1939 tale.The acting at some points is spotty, but nothing that takes away from the pleasure of the film. In fact, for the most part the strong performances from both Michelle Williams and Rachel Weisz (The latter of whom looks absolutely stunning in this picture) as Glinda and Evanora really pull you into the story and you find yourself picking a side while ultimately knowing what the outcome in the long run will be. Mila Kunis also gives us a good performance as Theodora, also known as The Wicked Witch of the West, both before she is is evil and after she lets the hatred settle into her and boil over into something sinister.There is great characterization, leaving you plenty of choice for favorites, but they went too far with the animation because at times you feel as if you are in a video game. The 3-D is very well utilized, but still, you have to remind yourself that you are watching a live action and not an animated movie. But the biggest fail of this movie was the script not mentioning once at the existence of the Ruby Slippers. This was a prequel, and the whole premise of the Wizard of Oz involves the Ruby Slippers, so I thought that it would be minutely implemented towards the end, especially during the final battle with Evanora and Glinda. But that fact notwithstanding this movie merits a 7/10 because they do show you some classic Oz and the characters give you their share of laughs.

146,EmmaDinkins,Chix Chat on Film Review: Mesmerized by Oz,8,9 March 2013,"When you follow a tried and true formula that renders a successful outcome, then the expectation is that you will recreate the magic. This story was a very imaginative approach to how the Wizard came to be in Oz and revered as great and powerful. In this film we see a classic opening just as with its predecessor The Wizard of Oz where it begins in Black and White and then as Oscar Diggs (James Franco) descends into the magical land of Oz everything is infused with vivid color. Thus begins his journey to enlightenment. Speaking of the descent, traversing the waterfall stressed me out, just saying. Even though the story was about Oz, it would have had little entertainment value had it not unveiled the true nature of the witches. Theodora (Mila Kunis) had the most provocative story and we know how her story goes and the same is true with her sister Evanora (Rachel Weisz), but there were a few things that I expected from this prequel that were not delivered, but there was so much more that made up for having no ruby slippers. I saw this film in 3-D and I typically do a good job of staying focused on the screen as various objects hurl towards me. This film won the game of 'I made you blink', I was actually flinching and blinking throughout the film, so I conceded the game. The point that I wanted to make is that the special effects were simply amazing. As Oz sets out on the road to meet his destiny he encounters China Girl (Joey King) and the symbolism of how he helps her wasn't lost either. I wasn't particularly amazed by China Town although I know it took some craftsmanship to generate, I felt that China Girl was a masterful creation, and an absolute work of art. The flying apes were frightening. I will say that when the credits rolled I was waiting for a future shot with a Wizard of Oz type ending that never came. I hope that wasn't an indication of a prequel sequel because I can't imagine that there is anything more to be said. The really cool thing is that Hollywood finally came with a film with roles for a significant number of little people, which hasn't happened in more than fifty years, there was an opportunity with Willy Wonka but the decision was to cast just one guy for all the oompa loompas, I digress again.

148,PassPopcorn,Pass the Popcorn review,3,14 March 2013,"Oz the Great and Powerful is a prequel to the 1939 cult movie The Wizard of Oz. However, this makes no sense because, in the original, it is heavily implied that the land of Oz and its characters are just a product of Dorothy's dream. This raises a question - why does a movie that explores a backstory of a character from a dream even exist? The answer is money, of course.In 2010 an abomination of a movie called Alice in Wonderland hit the theaters and in spite of its many flaws managed to be one of the highest grossing movies of all time. Apparently, the greedy studio executives in Disney decided to recycle Alice's formula so they could create another cash cow for themselves. And this is how they did it - both movies are spin offs of popular old children movies, directed by established directors (Burton/Raimi), scored by Danny Elfman and infested with CGI. The similarities don't end here. Both movies also follow the same plot pattern - an unlikely hero (Alice/Oz) escapes his everyday reality and enters a beautiful magical world (Wonderland/The Land of Oz) where he is confronted with a strange prophecy that says he will bring peace to this land. Eventually the hero, aided by a female character dressed in white (White Queen/Glinda the Witch), leads a small army against a much larger army led by a strong female antagonist (Red Queen/Two Witches). Not only are there plot and background similarities but these two movies also have almost matching release dates. Alice was released on the 5th of March and Oz on the 7th. Nothing was left to chance, Disney wanted to recreate Alice's success. In conclusion, Oz the Great and Powerful isn't a movie but a carefully planned way to trick you out of your money. Don't succumb to Disney's greed! But let's put all of this aside for now and judge the movie by what it is - a movie. So, is Oz the Great and Powerful a good movie? Hell no! First of all, the CGI is OK I guess, but it makes no sense. The visuals in the original Wizard of Oz looked like a weird combination of childish imagery and something you see while on LSD. The prequel has the same generically bland CGI overblown visual style every movie has nowadays. Also, it seems someone involved in creating this movie mistook good visual effects for telling a good story, since this movie has none. Oz shamelessly reuses almost every cliché created in movie history. And besides that, the acting is stiff and forgettable, the dialogue is abysmal and jokes often fall flat. I see no reason why anyone would want to see this movie, except to fill Disney with money.Rating: 3/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/",Oz the Great and Powerful
149,rebecca-ry,The Wizard of Wonderland,7,18 March 2013,"'Oz: The Great and Powerful' is the prequel to 'The Wizard of Oz.' Carnival magician Oscar – known as Oz – gets caught up in a tornado whilst in a hot air balloon. When he escapes the storm, he finds himself in a magical land where he is to be the king as long as he defeats the wicked witch. The story itself is very loosely based on L. Frank Baum's stories of Oz but the film works well in tying in with its predecessor. The story is very cleverly shows how the magician tricks people into believing he really is a wizard with the use of illusion. There are a lot of nice little references to 'The Wizard of Oz' here but not too many and they are very subtle. One thing I will note however is that CGI Oz is nothing compared to the original setting. There was something magical about the hand-painted flowers and real yellow brick road that really captured people's imaginations, because you knew Judy Garland was really looking at these things instead of standing infront of a big green screen. The CGI is not that impressive here which is surprising, it reminded me of Tim Burton's 'Alice in Wonderland,' which was also largely full of computer graphics and no real settings. The film is very similar to 'Alice in Wonderland' and it seems a bit pointless, did anyone ever wonder about the wizard of Oz? I didn't. There are some scenes where the CGI is quite obvious and cartoon-like, there are scenes where it is really obvious that there is nothing really behind the actors – there are even a few instances where you can see little green lines outlining the actors which make the effects look shockingly cheap.The acting was fairly well done; Michelle Williams was probably the best in it as she gave a truly brilliant performance as the good witch. James Franco's performance is difficult to judge because at some points he is really funny, very emotive and his character is very believable. However, then there are other moments where he over-performs and it becomes a bit embarrassing because every other actor here take their roles very seriously. The same can be said for Mila Kunis, in the beginning her performance is decent enough but, when her character develops into the wicked witch of the West, her performance goes downhill. Obviously, it is going to be extremely hard to find anyone who can match Margaret Hamilton's performance. Mila Kunis does try her best but it simply doesn't work; she's not scary, not menacing and she's not even laughably bad which is unfortunate. Overall, this is a fairly decent film; it's really funny, unpredictable and it's not a terrible insult to 'The Wizard of Oz,' but it is very bloated, drawn out and quite anti-climactic. There seems to be a need for kids films to be turned into big-budget ultra-blockbuster films (see Hansel and Gretel, Alice in Wonderland, Snow White and the Huntsman and Jack the Giant Killer), this film is primarily a children's film and it tries to make it entertaining for adults but it simply isn't needed – we all remember loving the Wizard of Oz and we go to see this to be reminded of that experience. It doesn't quite live up to this expectation, it could have been a lot worse but thankfully they have done a good job here.",Oz the Great and Powerful
150,drew_atreides,Surprised how many classic RAIMI techniques made it in..,8,12 March 2013,"I have to say first and foremost: I am a Sam Raimi fan. I had been worried that he was kind of losing his quirky edge when he did films like SIMPLE PLAN, FOR THE LOVE OF THE GAME and THE GIFT. All were decent films, but they decidedly lacked that kinetic energy that made Raimi in the 80's. Then Spider-man came along, and it was....OKAY.. and then Spider-man 2 was terrific...and Raimi was back on track...And then along comes ""OZ THE GREAT AND POWERFUL"" and HOLY cow is Raimi back to what made Raimi great. I saw someone somewhere say ""Evil Dead for Kids"" when describing OZ, and that's what i thought too. SO many 'scare the pants off your kids"" moments in this movie. It's utterly fantastic.Not to mention how it manages to capture the magic of the original and just bring it back to life. There are some truly wonderous moments in this movie.And the characters.. OH the characters.... That little China Girl will just take your heart and steal it from you. What a wonderful addition to the OZ mythos. I really hope we get a sequel from this world.And that Raimi is involved with it. Thanks, Sam!",Oz the Great and Powerful
151,Morbius_Fitzgerald,Oz: Episode I: The Phantom Menace...wait?,4,21 June 2013,"I kind of enjoy adaptations of Oz. The only one I would call myself a fan of is Return To Oz and the only one I'd say I hated is The Wiz. Everything else is ""in between"" Usually its on a scale of ""okay"". These scales can be balanced into a positive note like Tin Man or the 1939 film. OR they can be...modern Disney! That is what Oz the Phantom-err... Great And Powerful is like.First off I have to compliment a few people. Michelle Williams as Glinda and Rachel Weiz as The Wicked Witch Of The East. They literally carried the movie. I have to say that if it wasn't for them this review would be calling this movie ""Emerald Sh*t City"".This movie feels like its one of the long awaited Star Wars prequels. There are few performances that carry the film but they are there, a crap performance whether its Jar-Jar, Christensen or Mila Kunis (for this one) they are there, None of the ""soul"" that the previous films had (complain about RTO all you like, at least THAT had a soul) and the only thing it feels like this attempted anything in is visual effects.Okay I'll go through each point. Mila Kunis was HORRIBLE. I don't mean normal Horrible, I mean the worst performance in a Summer blockbuster since we last saw Darth Vader. I am literally scratching my head thinking ""of all the things you could've done with this role...of all the people you could've Casted...why in God's name did you do that?"" The rest of the performances are bland with one other exception...Joey King. This little girl was actually quite a good actress. She also manages to carry the movie which is amazing considering she is only 13 years of age and you have some people who have been acting that said ""yes"" to this movie for 15 years.The script is amateurish and that says a lot in terms of the acting department (that James Franco is given material that makes his performance ""bland""). I mean how do you take an awful script and do a good performance out of it unless your Rachel Weiz, the China Girl and Michelle Williams? Apparently. The plot isn't even worth mentioning. From what I will tell you, the two supremely evil witches are scared off by fireworks. FIREWORKS! None of this above would've mattered if it had a soul and that is what it misses. I haven't seen such a brainless or heartless kids film in years. Return To Oz, now that had heart, Saw has more of a heartwarming family feel if you compare it to this. As a script, as a family film, all the ""magic"" of Oz is without a doubt, dead when it comes to this film.Overall if you want to watch a family film, don't rely on the crap Disney is making now. If you want Oz watch Tin Man, Wizard Of Oz or Disney's own film, Return To Oz.",Oz the Great and Powerful
152,cattjones,A Film for your Inner Child,9,9 March 2013,"I am just going to start out by saying that any critic that does not like this film has lost their inner child. When I first saw the 1939 classic The Wizard of Oz, I always wondered how the heck the wizard got there and why the wicked witch was so mean. I was delighted to finally have the answers to both of those questions. I saw this film in 3D and I can tell you that I made the right choice. Even from the opening credits the film is visually stunning. The writers of this screenplay did an excellent job paying homage to its predecessor. There were tidbits of the characters that would emerge in the future. The film centered on how the wizard came to be, but the characters that I liked the most were not even human. The faithful Finley (Zach Braff) as the flying monkey was charming and funny. He had some of the best lines in the film. China girl (Joey King) pulled at my heart strings and was a typical girl with a stubborn temperament. The CGI of these two characters were expertly done and someone should get an award. As a matter of fact the CGI throughout the film was breath-taking. I would have thought that they would have gotten someone like Johnny Depp to play Oz since these are the kind of roles that he seems to like, but I have to say that James Franco (Oscar Diggs) seemed to fit the role to a tee. Theodora (Mila Kunis) is the gullible and somewhat delusional witch, who seems to want to create a reality that does not exist. Evanora (Rachel Weisz) is the control freak who has an over-bearing power over her sister, Theodora. And then there is Glinda (Michelle Williams), the good witch who is surprisingly down-to-earth and is responsible for keeping the wizard grounded. I would be remiss if I did not mention the Master Tinker (Bill Cobbs) who is the mechanic tasked with creating ""the great and powerful"" part of this film. Although there were a couple of times where things jumped out of the screen that made some of the younger viewer scream, this film was a joy to watch. I think that director Sam Raimi hit it out of the park with this one and I hope that it becomes an instant classic. I am giving this film a green light.",Oz the Great and Powerful
153,jacklmauro,The Road More Traveled,8,17 June 2013,"The bad: No, it's not 'The Wizard of Oz', and even savvy critics still seem to take points off for this as they acknowledge that it does not seek to be that classic. The costumes. Strange. Why is Theodora in a Halston ensemble while her sister is dressed like a drag queen? The monkey. OK, it's Disney and we must have the funny sidekick, but...yeesh. There are also minor items to quibble with, as in Potter- esque duels lacking in innovation. There's also the major flaw of uneven pacing. All that said, well done. It's a finely-crafted fairy tale and it brings home a few morals kids really, really need to know. The acting is strong (although Weisz is hesitant),and it's smart to use Franco and give a manly sexiness to the young wizard. The effects are just right, and the climactic scene works like a charm. Best of all is Mila Kunis, and I really don't get the dismissals of her here from other reviewers. Far more so than Weisz, she inhabits the character fully, and she's the most excellent component in a very good film. And 'Oz', if not the classic, simply is a very good film.",Oz the Great and Powerful
154,s_campanale,OZ Episode III - The Revenge of the Witch!,8,16 April 2013,"I wasn't sure what to expect here, but the trailers and poster art looked good, and it featured a lot of actors I like (Franco, Kunis, Weisz). Plus of course it is Sam Raimi's big return to the blockbuster after the Spiderman 4 debacle, and he is a director that you will always want to check out even if he is directing a Pizza Hut commercial.The special effects are brilliant, and the use of 3D is spectacular, especially during the first arrival at the Oz riverbank. The titles, as with all Raimi productions, are a delight in themselves, as is Danny Elfman's majestically Elfman-esque score (nice to see they have patched up their infamous differences). The use of black and white 4X3 in the opening Kansas based sequence is a nice nod to the original film, as are the ""doppelgangers"" that appear in different forms in the two worlds. Despite being a Disney production, the film is not too ""kiddie"" nor sugary sweet, but is similar in tone to the ""Spiderman"" movies, with some darkness involved, perhaps too dark for what is supposed to be a happy gay fairy-tale land (Genocide, murder, genuine feelings of bereavement and loss,orders to slaughter everyone, ""the yellow brick road will run red with the blood of all the people"", etc) not to mention some extremely revealing outfits for all the three young witches and a near striptease from Kunis at one key point. But they are in tune with Baum's original novels, which often went to some uncomfortable places.The story is a purely invented one and has no connection with the 1939 movie, Baum's writings or even the musical ""Wicked"", which offers a drastically different origin story based in part on the author's work. In fact this backstory to how the womanizing carnival huckster becomes the Wizard of OZ and how the three witches become what they are carries a very heavy feeling of deja-vu. The nobody bum who gets whisked to another place and time and there realises their true greatness is a re- run of Raimi's greatest work ""Army of Darkness"", itself based unashamedly on Twain's ""A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's court"", but that is an often told story anyway. More striking are the similarities with the ""Star Wars"" prequels that shared the same function. Evanora (Weiz) has the Palpatine role as the trusted public administrator prosecuting a phoney war against forces she herself secretly controls, and who beneath the mantle of office is a dark witch plotting to create a personal dictatorship. Theodora (Kunis) has the Anakin Skywalker part as the powerful but troubled young fighter for good who falls under the spell of the Palpatine mentor that cruelly manipulates their romantic agonies to make them turn to the ""dark side"", becoming the iconic black clad embodiment of evil (with the hero saying they know there is still good in them and hoping someday to reach it) Glinda (Williams) the Good witch might be seen as a Yoda figure, the good magician in exile hoping in the prophecy that will end the war, tutoring the hero to take down the evil duo. The Winki guards start as the loyal troops of the kingdom but become the stormtroopers of evil, and the Emerald city is a dead ringer for Episode I-III's Courcausant. Plus the finale sees a clash between Evanora and Glinda in the seat of power using force lightning that ends with Evanora horribly disfigured to tie in with the original. Since Disney now own Star Wars it isn't really stealing anymore, and kudos to Kapner and Raimi for pulling off in 2 hrs what took Lucas almost 10 of mostly empty filler to achieve.James Franco, a comic actor of great skill and a dramatic one of distinctly less skill, plays Oz as a sleazeball with a good heart, but being Franco you only ever really get the sleazeball part. He has strong ties with Raimi, and besides owing him his fame, he was also his original choice for Peter Parker, so it was a personal casting decision. He plays it with his comic style, and of the two that is the best. Rachael Weisz, an annoyingly superficial actress in youth but maturing to greater stature now, tries to bring some McDermid-esque menace and power to Evanora, but sadly evil isn't her natural fit and she looks hopelessly lost in so many scenes (though visually she is fantastic, especially when flying) Mila Kunis, another good comic star, looks gorgeous, but overacts far too much and has been universally panned. Perhaps she was trying to channel Hayden Christensen, in which case she was far TOO successful! Her post-transformation green witch look is also rather odd looking, almost like a sexual fantasy version of the WWW. Her broomstick flying and wild cackle also intentionally recall Raimi's own Green Goblin, (part inspired by the WWW anyway) which is either a Meta self-nod or just laziness. The two animated sidekicks are cute and clever, especially the China Doll girl, who is wonderfully rendered and animated, and touchingly played by Jaime King (most of the real emotions stem from her) but with some sass and attitude to stop her getting too mawkish. Zach Braff gives life to the flying monkey, a winning and likable comic relief despite achieving almost nothing as a character.All in all a solid and entertaining film that can be enjoyed by all ages, though it has upset the purists and ""Wicked"" fans, and irked many with its odd casting. If there are other episodes, we hope they will be keep up the quality. If not, then this one was more than enough fun!",Oz the Great and Powerful
155,hung_fao_tweeze,Not terrible but lacks the fun songs and the heart,7,10 March 2014,"I recall towards the end of 'The Wizard Of Oz' the wizard explains to Dorothy that he is a good man, just a bad wizard. In the case of 'Oz, The Great And Powerful', the wizard is really not a good man. He is greedy. He will seduce anything in a skirt only to run away after 'scoring'. Granted, he makes up for it at the end but it doesn't feel genuine or heart-warming. For myself, this is not exactly what I expected as the prequel to the character made so memorable by Frank Morgan in 1939. Instead, we have James Franco somewhat lampooning his way through his lines. In fact, this is but one of the many downsides to this alleged prequel. None of the characters save for the Wicked Witch (of the West) seem to contain any hint of personality of their eventually older 1939 counterparts, though this witch is without her wart for some reason. I kept thinking throughout that to achieve any resemblance to the original witch would not have been that difficult. These 1939 characters are so branded in the mind that they would be easy to parody. Alas. Even Glinda lacks any of the Billie Burke's lovely cadence. Michelle Williams tends to sleep her way through her role frequently looking spaced-out. Mila Kunis does a good job though she is no Margaret Hamilton. The best character here is arguably the China Doll, and that was CGI (again). Yes, ho-hum, CGI rules the day in this movie, but it is not so flamboyant that it becomes overkill like too many other movies we know. It seems to support what is going on rather than overwhelm and astound. And where are the catchy songs?? No, this is not a musical. In fact, when the Munchkins start to deliver a song that might have actually been worthwhile it gets hushed up. No, this is not your grandmother's Wizard of Oz. It is an attempt to deliver a prologue to the 1939 classic. Story-wise, it appears to succeed, sort of, though I would have not liked to have known that the Wicked Witch's biggest problem is that the Wizard spurned her and she is bearing a grudge. That felt like an insult to my intelligence for some reason. Could it have not somehow been more clever than that? Soooo...this movie has none of the heart, none of the music, none of the compelling characters of the original. The acting is pedestrian...almost flippant. The script is razor thin on moral values. I guess I would have liked to have seen the Wizard glue all of China Doll's family back together - that would have saved the ending, IMO. Yet, if we are to judge this movie on its own, it isn't that bad. I did enjoy it mostly. So I gave it a 7. If compared to its 1939 predecessor, it would be a 5, but it was entertaining and the special effects are fanciful.",Oz the Great and Powerful
156,jljacobi,Visuals and length overwhelm the story.,5,28 May 2013,"A great idea for a movie and a good story but just about everything is overdone. The visuals are quite nice with a nod to the past, but there are simply too much of them. A lot of needless shots that were clearly inserted for 3D effect and panoramas that run too long. Needless sexiness, needless explanations for the patently obvious, needless cliffs, needless this, needless that.I'd say this movie was designed for 8-year olds, but that would be insulting the children. There are some good actors involved and some good scenes, but it needs is to be re- edited to about half the length. I fast forwarded through large parts of it. Enough said.",Oz the Great and Powerful
157,brent_or,Flashes of Unrealized Potential,5,13 March 2013,"James Franco's acting is painful to watch. Michelle Williams is absolutely wonderful. Awkward combination.In many cases, the script (and possibly the editing) does not help Franco or the other actors out at all. I continue to be amazed at how many of these big, expensive films manage to get all the way to theatrical release with such underwritten, awkward screenplays. I know that these are extremely complicated projects for anyone to helm, but the art of screen writing is not something that should be neglected.Other than that, I found OZ THE GREAT AND POWERFUL to be a mixed bag. It's not nearly as grand or ultimately majestic as the original WIZARD OF OZ film, which by the way is over 70 years old. Nor is it quite as effective as a modern CGI-fueled epic as Peter Jackson's Tolkien films. There are some truly beautiful scenic panoramas, most notably the opening sequence in Oz, when the film first breaks into glorious widescreen color. However, the integration of live actors and computer rendered-environments is often less than seamlessly convincing, and there is a cartoonishness to things such as the Emerald City that parallels the at-times very childish dialogue. Additionally, the story jumps quite abruptly to character realizations and plot points several times, which again, feels like an underwritten screenplay.Still, there are some elements that are quite compelling in and of themselves, at least. The opening credits sequence and black and white Kansas scenes are nicely old-fashioned and claustrophobic. The ""porcelain girl"" is one of the most adorable characters ever conceived, and the animation on her is astoundingly good. And the best thing about this film storywise is the conceptual take on the Wizard. There are some wonderful moments of realization dealing with what magic really is, the power of inspiration, and how being good is better than being great, in the end. The film's ""Money Scene"" is fantastic. Unfortunately, James Franco and the screenplay conspire to prevent it from being as well executed as it should have been.There is some good acting, mostly from Michelle Williams. The quality-feel of the film gets a profound boost the second she appears on screen, and she does a wonderful job throughout. I feel a little sorry about that, because her performance is much too good for this film. Mila Kunis suffers from some of the same awkward performance syndrome as Franco, but still manages to create a tragic character who feels worthwhile. She is just a likable actress, and that counts here. Rachael Weisz is underutilized. She's a great actress, but doesn't do a whole lot here, one way or the other.Overall, I found myself fairly disappointed with this one. Lots of eye candy and some moments of genuine splendor, but yet again, not a very good screenplay and a few really wooden performances. I expected something a bit more finely honed from Sam Raimi. Also, whilst a lot of the humor is very childish, the witches can be significantly frightening, so the target demographic is a little conflicted. (What else is new, right?) I give it 5.5 out of 10.0. Not a must see, but not a total waste either.",Oz the Great and Powerful
158,JamesIan2021,"Powerful, Just A Great Film",8,12 May 2015,"Truly living up to it's title of Great and Powerful, Oz is one of the most immersive, fun and visually stunning movies I've ever seen. The opening sees Oscar Diggs playing a trickster and a fraud, fooling his audiences into believing he is a master of magic, yet after being revealed he is chased through a carnival and escapes in a balloon. This whole sequence is shot in a tiny frame rate in a cramped, tightly packed image that features grain and a sepia type colour scheme, the employment of this idea is clever as it gets you excited for when the adventure gets to the magical world. Of course, when Oscar is whisked into the world of Oz the screen opens up and the colour comes to life revealing grandeur and incredible imagery, every single frame throughout this adventure is packed with something stunning. Sam Raimi's direction is sweeping and mystical, I love his delightfully energetic tone and pace and especially, his use of shadows seen in his other films like Drag Me To Hell. The 3D mixed with the incredible world building here creates one of the finest experiences ever, forget Avatar and Transformers, Oz thrusts tiny critters and numerous objects out the screen with such pop and energy you shudder in your chair but the laughs you have from these moments add to the humour already here. The depth is mind blowing, watch the sequence where the hot air balloon dives down the waterfall and through the rocky rivers, it is like being on a roller-coaster at the front seat. It simply has to been seen in the format. The cast are magnificent, James Franco's line delivery is similar to magicians you see in real life and that makes his character feel believable, and I could feel his enthusiasm. Michelle Williams is an absolute beauty, and as Glenda she looks like a Queen and plays the part superbly. Mila Kunis does the a fine job playing Theodora, a good witch who believes Oscar is the key to saving her world, and Kunis ups her game when she is turned into a revengeful bad witch, it's Kunis' ability to convey emotion and expression that proves her talent. For me Rachel Weisz is the best here as the sinister witch Evanora who is plaguing the land of Oz, Weisz' intensity and the fun she is having give her authority on screen and she plays a wonderful antagonist, and she's seriously hot. I highly recommend this movie, it has its moments catered for kids but it needs that as there are some darker moments involving the little clay pot girl, brought to life by excellent voice-work by Joey King. Catch it in 3D and you'll have a riot of a time, watch it normally and still Oz The Great And Powerful is a Disney best.",Oz the Great and Powerful
159,rogerdob,"Trite, Trite, Trite",1,10 March 2013,"I was so anxious to see this movie and it turns out to be a long dud! The lines that the actors speak are so trite...nothing original or creative...the same old messages (e.g. ""nothing's impossible if you believe hard enough"") found in all other movies but done the same way that's done in those other movies.I did not like the fact they made the wizard a sleazy womanizer.There is a ""china doll"" character which was the equivalent of Jar Jar Binks...I wanted to slap her, she was so annoying. The witches were portrayed as silly girls, fighting over the attention of the womanizer wizard to such an extent that when one feels he has rejected her, she turns bad! It's not about Oz apparently, it's all about high school jealousy.And I would like to see Hollywood stop stereotyping black people. Do they always have to be shown with ""attitude?"" Munchkins are Munchkins no matter what color they are...and they don't have to have a special attitude and be different from others simply because they have black skin.",Oz the Great and Powerful
160,cyifly-2,Certainly Entertaining -- But not Great or Powerful,6,17 March 2013,"In a small nutshell -- You have to compare it to the classic, because it is using some of the same characters, and using references to the first movie. It stands well on its own, and is entertaining. The special effects are seamless and the 3D is very good.Here comes the 'however.' However... it's no Wizard of Oz. It's no classic. The wonderful reasons The Wizard of Oz is a classic, is all the reasons this film will be forgotten a week after you see it. There is not a single rememberable line. (We are not in Kansas anymore, and your little dog, Toto, too, There is no place like home and countless others -- All classic lines used in film, stage, song and life still today); There are no classic songs... In fact I can only remember one song sung total, and don't remember it now. Somewhere over the Rainbow still gets sung on Idol, Broadway, remade by artists etc, and you can still sing some others from the original 75 years later. There is not one single rememberable, remarkable character. The ceramic doll was unique, but not interesting. The monkey was cute, but not something I'll remember next year... I don't remember any of their names now. I do remember the Tin Man who wanted a heart, the cowardly lion who wanted courage, the scarecrow who wanted a brain.I didn't want to compare the two movies. I wanted to give this one a shot on it's own merit. But it made me do it.It's not bad. It's actually pretty good. Just not classic and very forgettable. It entertained me for a few hours and was worth the price of admission. But if you are looking for a classic, it's not here. A few weeks from now, I will forget I even saw it.",Oz the Great and Powerful
161,chuck-526,solid and timely ...but not magical,7,20 March 2013,"In the terms of a time-line ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" is a ""prequel"" to ""The Wizard of Oz"" (although some of its details match L. Frank Baum's books more than they match the film ""The Wizard of Oz""). In more general terms, it's an attempt to build on that classic: updating it for our times and largely replacing it in our consciousness. And -despite quite a few legal oddities with specific permissions- it sorta succeeds ...just not enough.It takes full advantage of current technology's ability to create fantastical visuals. The flying brooms and the lightning fights are reminiscent of -even better than- anything I've seen in a Harry Potter movie. There are fireworks and sizzle cannons and flash explosions. There are huge believable flying bubbles and bubble walls -an effect I haven't seen before. Fogs grow out of the ground and tumble forward on command. There are lots of marble surfaces of buildings and even furniture in the Emerald City. Fantastical landscapes fill the screen. An indication of just how much depended on CGI is the end credits. For most of the time the credits look unremarkable, the only clue to something a little different being some credits for a ""previs"" group. Then all the Visual Effects credits burst forth almost like an explosion all at once just before the music credits. Quite a few different studios were involved, and there are hundreds of individual names.In fact you may enjoy watching the movie on a really big screen in 3D mainly for the visual spectacle.There are some extraordinary non-CGI shots too. The whole opening in the circus is one long tracking shot with no cuts. There are no tracks visible, and my first thought was it was an extended Steadicam shot ...except sometimes the camera presents an overview from twenty feet in the air, and I don't know of any flying Steadicam. The only way I can imagine to get such a shot is with a very large crane moving its basket. But even then the coordination of so many actors and subplots and avoidance of any shadows would have been non-trivial.There are many ties to ""The Wizard of Oz"". There are three witches, and we find out why some of them are evil. There's literally a road made of yellow bricks. The Emerald City is huge and very tall. Some of the characters in Oz are reflections of characters we've met earlier in the introduction. There's a tornado (and even a flying house caught up in it). There's quite a bit of ""magic"". In the throne room special effects are prepared in a little side room behind a curtain. Even the trick of starting in B&W, then changing to Color when entering Oz is repeated (and further amplified by also starting in the old narrow Academy aspect ratio, then growing on both sides to Widescreen when entering Oz). And all the lands and characters are present. (There were more ""munchkins"" than I've ever seen in one place before, but their motivation for being there was unfortunately a little weak.) There are also a few new effects. In particular a ""China Doll"" character is cute, fascinating, and utterly believable. There are quite a few rather subtle ironic or self-deprecating jokes too. It seems a perfect match for the current zeitgeist.And yet somehow it doesn't all come together as well as it should have. I have to lay much of the blame for that on the portrayal of Oz by James Franco. Normally I'm a fan of Mr. Franco's, both his acting in general and his willingness to take on -even seek out- unconventional roles even though they probably won't pay much. But somehow he just doesn't work in this particular film. I expect Oz to be a little slimy, and self-aware to the point of self-doubting. And if you closed your eyes and just listened carefully to the dialog, that's exactly what you'd get. But watching the character, the impression I got instead contained too much eagerness and innocence.Don't get me wrong - this film is by no means a strike-out. It's a solid double, or maybe even a triple. (In fact, if it had been released in the pattern of ""The Little Engine that Could"" it conceivably could have even been a sleeper hit.) But when the filmmakers were so obviously trying hard to hit the ball clear out of the park, anything less comes off as a disappointment.",Oz the Great and Powerful

Movie starts with a story of average magician from Kansas in early XX. He's name is OZ and he wants to be a great man, but shows some cheap tricks to get everyday pocket money. He's not a real wizard and does not believe in any fairy tale stupidity. OZ the Great and Powerful follows Oz's adventure in enchanted land, with witches, flying monkey's and incredible sightseeing. He meets three witches Theodora (Mila Kunis), Evanora (Rachel Weisz) & Glinda (Michele Williams) and there is a task, he has to find out Which Witch is Which (aka which of them is evil).OZ is an enjoyable movie to watch, for the following three reasons: fantastic art direction, almost perfect 3D and it's just kind of fun. It's even more colorful than Alice in Wonderland, it's somehow less blue version of Avatar. The rest is almost as cheap as a ticket for it in the cinema (well, for me it was way too cheap). Acting is average, except than Rachel Weisz, who make a good bad Witch (oops, I said it). James Franco is too handsome for being a magician and Mila Kunis too sexy to be sitting on the broom. There are some funny moments and jokes, which is good but mostly it is an average kid movie for adults like me and many others. If you want to watch some ""special"" story of OZ, don't bother. Do not spend your time and money unless you want to see visual beauty.",Oz the Great and Powerful
165,~AleXa~,Beautiful and yet somehow hollow and forgettable,6,9 March 2013,"Oz the Great and PowerfulBeautiful and yet somehow hollow and forgettableTo start, I shall preface this review by noting that I did no reading on the film and try to know as little as possible going in so that I have NO expectations, so I was probably the only one who did not realize this was a prequel, but merely a remake with a different spin (i.e. Snow White and the Hunstman). I was enthralled at first, and loved the use of the black and white in the beginning of the film, and felt the filmmakers made use of great storytelling. I was along for the ride, right up until Oz (James Franco) blasts through the tornado into the land of Oz and is promptly met by Theodora (Mila Kunis). Her portrayal is very rigid, as though Mila herself doesn't understand her character. That scene completely took me out of the movie and disrupted the flow. Then they meet a carriage and guards, and promptly are taken to Emerald City where we meet Evanora (Rachel Weisz). Her portrayal was a bit more realistic, and believable that she struggled between being two different personas.The beauty in most scenes is breathtaking, and yet intangible. It fails to exhibit the seamless blend of reality and computer-generated images that Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland achieved. I couldn't help but feel the overuse of computer graphics somehow detracted from many of the scenes instead of adding to them. I continually felt like I was watching a CG world with the actors spliced into the scene. And the multi-colored horses? That was like a bad scene from a Barbie movie! Very crude and childish.All the while, I was struggling to make sense of the land and the backstory, as I haven't seen The Wizard of Oz since I was a child. That's usually what prequels do—set up the origins and explain things you didn't know before. This film did not do this in the least in my opinion, save to explain how the Wicked Witch came to be. For example, how did the yellow brick road come to be, why does Glinda have her own castle if her kingdom and home was within Emerald City, and why do the good people of Oz who were living in a bubble with Glinda suddenly appear in Emerald City for the crux moment? Where were the rest of Finley's kind? Was the china doll child the only one to survive? I was left with so many more questions than answers.I did enjoy the exploration of the central themes, namely learning to believe in yourself and understanding that our actions have consequences. The introduction of new and memorable characters, particularly the china doll and Finley, were enjoyable, and in some respects more fleshed out than their human counterparts. I did find it odd that they seemed to play homage to the lion and the scarecrow, but made no reference to the tin man. I actually was quite excited at the appearance of the lion and thought there'd be more to come.Overall, the film was highly reminiscent of a cinematic roller coaster, with the ups and downs and good and bad script-writing and acting in places. It felt as though the actors didn't have clear direction on where to take their characters, and many scenes come off forced and unbelievable. Some subplots were initiated and then not fully explored. Computer animation was used as a horrid crutch to the detriment of the believability of most scenes. I love Sam Raimi's work, and it's hard to say how much of the faults are direction, screen-writing, or acting. At the end of it all, I felt like I was built up and then was left yearning for more. So much potential, so little fulfillment.6.5 out of 10.0~Halo~",Oz the Great and Powerful
166,sildarmillion,"Okay, so I finally got to watch a movie in IMAX-3D and it was worth it",7,16 March 2013,"I do think that the 3D in this movie was great or maybe just the IMAX 3D was great. And maybe that's why it is getting such a high rating from me. The story wasn't fabulous but I expected it to be terrible (based on the trailers). But I was pleasantly surprised how well they tied it into the original Wizard of Oz story - or tied it in as much as they could. As in I'm surprised that they even put in this much effort to tie it in with the original story. I'm thinking of Wicked and how it was more like a different version of the story rather than a prequel.Overall, the movie was entertaining. I was really tired and about to fall asleep while I was watching it. But it was interesting enough to keep me awake. Although I must say I didn't like the very last scene because (without spoiling it) there was no justification for it - it was like a cop-out reward to a character and it also actually doesn't work with the original story now that I think about it.Anyways, I would recommend it just for the 3D. The opening sequence and the floating down the river sequence were fantastic. And it really did make it worth it.",Oz the Great and Powerful
167,heatsink98,"Oz...the great...and, OK just forget about it.",5,20 October 2013,"Sam Raimi can put on a show; that's clear. Rachel Weisz and Michelle Williams can act. I thought Mila Kunis and James Franco could act as well, but this movie showed some serious problems with their acting ranges.This film has some top-notch backgrounds and visuals, which provide the eye-candy audiences love. The story, however, is flat and uninspired. It seemed more a theme park ride dragging James Franco through the scenes until we arrived at an ending. The usual epic plot structure elements didn't make it into the final screenplay for some reason.The acting problems mentioned above are not minor, either. Watching scenes with Rachel Weisz made James Franco and Mila Kunis look like amateurs in comparison. I think James Franco was miscast for this role, given the circus showman lines his character bellows. That flashy, snake-oil salesman dialog came out sounding uninspired, unbelievable, and cringe-inducing. Mila Kunis does OK until she delivers dialog that should carry weight behind it, such as in the final battle scene where she yelled out that she defied the wizard. That line came out like someone in a high school play just screamed it.Overall, the film is pretty but the lousy acting and weak story line drag it down.",Oz the Great and Powerful
168,rtp4242,Movie Review: Oz The Great and Powerful (2013) Not Oz-some,3,18 September 2013,"Oz (James Franco) is a carnival magician in Kansas, and a bit of a con-man. He's in love with a girl named Annie (Michelle Williams) who has been proposed to by another man. After a seemingly successful levitation trick, a little girl in a wheelchair (Joey King) asks him if he can make her walk. When he says he can't the people of Kansas run him out on a rail, and he barely gets out of town on a hot air balloon.The balloon is caught up in a tornado, and by the time Oz wakes up, he is ironically in a land called Oz, where he meets Theodora. (Mila Kunis) Theodora tells Oz that he fulfills the prophecy of a great leader who comes from the sky to save the Land of Oz from disrepair. Theodora and Oz fall in love instantly, and she happily introduces him to her sister, Evanora. (Rachel Weisz) Evanora shows Oz the castle in the Emerald City where Oz is to reside, and shows him a room full of gold. All he has to do to get this gold is kill a witch in the Dark Forest. Oz decides to go to the forest, with newfound friends Finley the flying monkey (Zack Braff) and China Girl. (Joey King) What does he find in the Dark Forest? There is one rule in movies or music, if you're going to re-make a movie or a song, it has to be better than the original. Technically Oz, the Great And Powerful is not a remake of the Wizard of Oz, it's a prequel, but the same rule should apply. This movie isn't better, it's far worse than the original. It borrows too much from the original, Oz is from Kansas, he get swept up in a tornado, and taken to Oz, where he meets most of the characters from the Wizard of Oz. The beginning of the film is even shot in black and white, just like the original, more of a cheap copy than homage.There's not only one clunky love story, there's two to contend with, in what's essentially a kids story. Bad idea. Oh and when it's not borrowing from the Wizard of Oz, it borrows from Snow White. In its rush to try to make a stunning visual movie, Oz forgets some of the most endearing parts of the original story. The original story was about believing in yourself, the Oz in the original had no powers at all, so all the magic came from inside Dorothy and the Scarecrow and the Tin Man, the phrase, the man behind the curtain, means a charlatan in today's society, precisely because of the Wizard of Oz, this movie talks about redemption, but only pays lip service to it.The acting is only so-so. James Franco is OK, as Oz he tries to be witty and charming, he tries really hard, but this is a retread of a story and not really worth the effort. Mila Kunis is overwrought as Theodora, all emotions all the time, crying, falling in love, it's all too much. Michelle Williams plays her character with such disinterest, it's hard to care about what happens to her. After starring in movies like Blue Valentine and My Week With Marilyn, this performance was a disappointment. Only Rachel Weisz gets it right as Evanora, she is evil, but subtlety so, even seductive in some scenes. It is a good performance in a movie populated by bland performances.But what really disappointed me about this movie was the inordinate amount of special effects, and CGI. This movie was overwhelmed by CGI, any ideas it may have put forward are drowned out by the numerous special effects. Two of the characters, China Doll and Finley are all CGI, all of Oz is CGI, what should have been an uplifting child's tale becomes an inauthentic cyber-film, dazzling to the eye, but with an empty soul. The movie is also much too long, and parts much too scary for little kids.For more powerful reviews on books and movies, visit my blog, reviewswithatude.wordpress.com.",Oz the Great and Powerful

The pacing seems a little off sometimes and the dialog is occasionally stilted. That said, I was generally pleased with it. Some scenes & effects are obvious tributes to the 30's classic and were enjoyable. I've been put off by James Franco in other movies, but unlike many here I think he played a sleazy carnival con man who is slowly turned into a good guy fairly well. Rachel Weisz does the best with her role, but she had some of the best lines while others had more clunky dialog. Oz the Great and Powerful is worth seeing.",Oz the Great and Powerful
170,GoUSN,Magnificent entertainment; script flaws and a leaden Kunis don't detract much,8,16 March 2013,"To my surprise, I liked it.The coming attractions were a poor representation of the film.The pros: Magnificent story-telling. The story was superb, a perfectly well thought out prequel to the Wizard of Oz. James Franco had an unexpected brightness. The China doll was imaginative and well-done, as was the monkey. The transition from black and white to color was a clever touch, as was the set-look of the Kansas scenes - it looked just like the Dorothy Gale world, just a few years earlier.The cons: The actors' elocution was surprisingly poor. Watch the Wizard of Oz, and hear the perfectly pronounced English, each word spoken clearly and well. Here, we had a lot of year 2000 diction, sloppy elocution, and a failure to emote precisely when precise emotion was called for. Kunis was particularly poor. She was either blandly understated, or stupidly overstated. An acting school case study for all the wrong reasons.The script needed (1) someone to edit it with an eye toward, at least, eliminating modern jargon and phrasing; (2) someone to go through and distinguish between the silly and the genuinely comic, then remove the silly; (3) a far better launch for Oz's journey from Emerald City, to give context to his motivation, maybe even directions perhaps (which way do I go?), and other basics of a journey in a strange land (what does the evil witch look like?). There were too many moments where I thought the script was screaming for help.Some of the interactions between the CGI and the humans were just awful. Not all of them, but enough that I noticed - and wondered why they'd deploy a particular effect if it wasn't absolutely convincing.And the direction. Did the director ever remind the players of mood, scene and tone? I felt sometimes that these people could just as well say these same phrases on the beach - so bland and unconvincing were both the lines and the presentation. Come on. This is big-ticket film - do it perfectly. Not just ""almost perfectly."" But in the end, I liked it. I thought it had a magnificence about it that was both stunning and surprising. And because it was magnificent, I noticed the warts even more.",Oz the Great and Powerful
171,dutchs-1,Just Doesn't Click,6,9 March 2013,"First the good news. Rachel Weisz steps out of her generally sympathetic roles and gives a haughty, icy performance as the wicked Evanora. Michelle Williams is a cute, mischievous pixie as Glinda, infinitely more appealing than the treacly, saccharine Glinda in the original film. I can't see Williams' Glinda chirping ""Toto, too"" to Dorothy. And the China Doll is darling. Can you see a toy spin off? The film does an honest job of matching the original classic at every opportunity.For openers, somebody lock all these CGI guys in a room and show them storm chaser videos until they can do a realistic tornado. Twister, Day After Tomorrow, now this. Real tornadoes are blacker, more menacing and more sharply defined than CGI twisters. Flying debris defines the rotation more than the cloud itself. The original film did it better with a stocking, for heaven's sake.The film opens in Kansas in 1905, in black and white, and lays out the devious character of Oz in a sequence that lasts at least twice as long as it needs to. He's a carnival magician, hardly enough to make him a con man in itself, although he's a serial seducer and mean to his assistant. A twister carries his hot air balloon off to Oz (Today's weather, mostly sunny with a 10% chance of Kansas falling).I don't lament the CGI. Oz is a wondrous place and the chance to see what we couldn't in 1939 is welcome. But so much is unconvincing. The weird overhanging hills just look silly, and the snow covered mountains around Glinda's realm lack personality. Real mountains have individual shapes, but these just look like somebody ran the fractal generator. For all the weirdness, the scenery lacks grandeur.Mila Kunis is lovely, sweet and vulnerable as good Theodora, but her transformation to evil is too abrupt to be convincing even if she does eat a magic apple. And why does she become green and misshapen even though Evanora isn't? The makeup people did a good job matching her to the original film, but her face is too round to sell it. They needed someone else. And showing her descending into evil in slow stages would have been far more convincing and scary than a one shot convulsion.Oz the future wizard is smarmy in Kansas and smarmy in Oz. You just knew Han Solo would come around. Tony Stark was interesting even as the shallow playboy. You know Oz will save the day because he has to, but there's nothing in him to really suggest it. As for reforming his womanizing ways, well, we really don't know where Glinda spent her time in the original movie, but you can still see him chasing everything with a skirt even after winning Glinda.Glinda vanquishes Evanora after a duel where Evanora flings green lightning. When Glinda smashes her amulet, Evanora turns hideous and is banished. Am I the only one who wonders if she turned up a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away as Palpatine?

173,anchoreddown,great update!,9,8 March 2013,"Sam Raimi is one of those directors who knows what he's doing.To recreate The Wizard of Oz would take a lot more time and expense. Not only that, but it's famous, for Pete's sake! Already having several number one blockbuster hits to his resume, Raimi takes on the task of hopefully adding another run-a-way hit. Not since Spiderman 3 has there been this much anticipation for him to make. Even though the third Spiderman was rocky and didn't quite go as planned, it generated enough dollar.Great casting, and kudos to Kunis! I thought her role was the equivalent to Johnny Depp stealing the show in the original Pirates. Michelle Williams did a great job, and Franco had a lot of great reactions as the Great Oz.The images were stunning, yet strangely familiar in some places,(most definitely needed to the proper placement), and for watching it in 3-D, it makes the performance very nice.

174,jpachar82,Decades in the Making,10,15 March 2013,"It has been 74 years since the original movie made us believe in the magic of Oz and those red slippers on the feet of a Kansas girl by the name of Dorothy Gale (RIP Judy Garland may you ever be missed for your dedication). So what do we know, we know that Dorothy travels to Oz to help free the kingdom from the clutches of the Wicked Witch of the West, but do we know why? Do we know who the Wizard was? Do we know why he even came to the Land of Oz?This movie answers all the questions you want to know about the Great and Powerful Oz. We do know that there are 3 witches – Glinda, the Good Witch (played beautifully by Michelle Williams), Evanora, the true Wicked Witch who later becomes the Wicked Witch of the East (played wonderfully by Rachel Weisz) and the creation from Evanora her sister Theodora who first greets Oscar who later becomes the Wicked Witch of the West (played by the awesome Mila Kunis). Evanora & Theodora conspire together to bring Oz to his knees, but it is him who separates the two women, I mean witches and restores all peace to the land. Now I have to give props to the man behind Oz, James Franco, he did an incredible job portraying the Great Wizard, but it was Sam Raimi who brought us all three Spider-Man movies that was the true Wizard. Thank you Sam for reminding us that 74 years ago the magic still lives on in 2013.",Oz the Great and Powerful
175,robbotnik2000,The numbers are there but it doesn't add up.,5,4 January 2015,"Just watched a flat-screen presentation of ""Ox, the Great and Powerful"" and was disappointed. Disappointed because I grew up with the classic ""Wizard of Oz""film and disappointed because I expected a lot of ""Oz"" from the opening credits. Stars I thought had talent, music from an imaginative and accomplished rock musician turned movie maestro, and clever credits. Even a nice square-screen in black and white to simulate the opening of the classic ""Wizard"". After that, it pretty much sags into formulaic territory with some innovation but no inspiration. I'm not going to give anything away about the plot, except for one thing: there's nothing to give away. To an extent, the movie doesn't make it's mind up to be anything. Is it a prequel? Is it a re-do? (It makes it's mind up from the start not to be a musical). To an extent it's of the formulaic but un-Oz-like genre: Bad News Bears the ""Challenge of the Underdogs"". There are witches but they are uninspired and uninspiring. There is a low-rent wizard. There are flying primates including one that does an impression of Billy Crystal.

Disney misrepresents a movie once again in it's trailer, apparently deciding to spend it's budget on marketing. The story is simple-minded, the graphics are awful with the green-screens being obvious and the background being blurred or out of focus, the very talented cast had nothing to work with, and overall it's silly from beginning to the flat ending which could have at least played off the beginning of the original. Glinda, the good witch of the South this time? Not that I object but s'up with dat. I should have heeded the red flag: Raimi directing. I was thinking it would have at least been on a par with Disney's ""Alice in Wonderland""(2010), but this is epic fail.",Oz the Great and Powerful

178,ramair350,SOLID 8 out of 10 - excellent family entertainment - magical journey!,8,11 March 2013,"Expectations have been sky high for Oz. The original movie from 70+ years ago still holds up well, so SURELY a new movie with the same setting will be even better, right? Of course not. Nothing can ever replace that magic of seeing Wizard of Oz for the first time as children. So let's get that out of the way right now.So how about this new Oz flick? I had a wonderful time seeing it. The rest of the crowd was responsive and clearly enjoyed it. It is a good movie, and is an example of ""why"" we enjoy going to the movies. It is a great escape and a fun journey in a magical land for a couple of hours - very well worth the price of admission.The visuals are stunning. Remember seeing Avatar and how beautiful the planet was? Oz is just as amazing. The visuals are worth the price of admission alone.The story is a solid. While this is a different story than the original, it definitely ""fits"" within the confines of the original's boundaries.I have heard lots of gripes about the acting. It seems that the world was on the James Franco bandwagon a couple of years ago, and now everyone is more than happy to blast him for bad acting. Most of his movies have been light-hearted, with him assuming the role of an easy-going pot-smoking dude (although I very highly recommend ""127 Hours"", where he does an excellent acting job!). Flawed but good at heart. Guess what - in this movie he is flawed but good at heart. He doesn't take himself too seriously, and neither does the audience. Is he the ""perfect"" Oz? That is debatable. But does he get the job done? Yes! And I have also heard complaints about Mila Kunis. Her first scene was a bit rough, because I couldn't stop thinking ""that's Mila Kunis"" instead of ""that's a witch in Oz"". But as the movie progresses, I thought she did fine. And Michelle Williams delivers a perfect performance; as far as I could tell, in real life she really IS a good witch, and just plays Michelle Williams on the side. So while Academy Award winning performances are absent, just don't expect that going in. Too bad Daniel Day Lewis was not available.In summary, this is a wonderful film that the whole family will enjoy!",Oz the Great and Powerful
179,PopCulturedwithMovieMike,A new take on the Wizard of Oz origin story.,8,29 January 2014,"Ricky wrote a great review above so I'm not going to go into a ton of detail. I echo a lot of the same sentiments regarding the film. Oz is a fun fantasy film that never takes itself too seriously. It's kind of hard to find a true fantasy film in the movie landscape today that seems littered with comic book adaptations. Oz turns out to be a perfect companion piece to the original. The film even opens in black and white and a 4:3 aspect ratio. It's not until the film turns to color and the large black bars on the side of the screen disappear and open to the world of Oz that we realize how confined the old format of film really was. As a film-goer, we really are fortunate to be living in an age where technology really has pushed the boundaries of imagination. That being said, it's hard to equal the impact of the original film where the similar trick was used with far more impact. This is mainly because people hadn't seen anything like it before. Today, even small films can be jam packed with tons of great visuals and special effects. Oz never tries to retell the story of The Wizard of Oz, instead it strives to reintroduce us to the world. For the most part, it's a resounding success. It's hard to believe that it's been 75 years since audiences have been back to Oz. Like the title of the movie suggests, the film really is an origin story about Oz, the mysterious Wizard. He plays a very small part in the original film, but he's the whole reason for the quest. Oz is played with adequate smarm and sleeze by James Franco. Oz isn't portrayed as some savior or a magical being, he's portrayed exactly for what he is - a con man. I actually really enjoy Franco's work, but I feel that he's kind of mailing this performance in at times. Some of his acting feels wooden and the delivery of some of his lines suggests that he might have thought he was staring in what would turn out to be a cinematic dud and a future Hollywood punchline. The fact of the matter is that Oz the Great and Powerful is not a bad film by any means. It's not great and it's not going change the film industry or the way we watch movies in anyway, but it's a more than enjoyable film to watch. Sure, there are some cheesy things here and there, but that's to be expected. The original has it's fair share of cheese as well. True Oz fanatics will feast upon all the Easter eggs and nods to the original, but you don't even have to have seen the original to enjoy this film. Some of the bigger twists are pulled off nicely here and the finale is extremely satisfying in a number of ways. I saw Oz in 3D. I don't normally like 3D, but I thought the films visuals would lend itself to a good experience. My movie theater has an all day bargain Tuesday for 5 bucks and they bump up the 3D ticket to 7, so I didn't think it was too bad. The scenes with tons of special effects were really good in 3D. Very bright and colorful, but I ran into the same problem as I always do with 3D films. Whenever there is a scene with dialogue, you forget you are watching a 3D movie. The reason for this is our brain is used to processing images in 3D. It's how we live our every day lives. For some of these more mundane scenes, it's easy for our brains to look at the screen and process it as nothing out of the ordinary. I don't regret seeing it in 3D, but it's not essential.",Oz the Great and Powerful
180,DragoonKain,Why don't they just adapt the other books?,6,25 July 2013,"Baum wrote 14 Oz books, and there were dozens of good ones written by other authors after he died, and yet the only adaptations you ever see are the first, second, and maybe a cartoon version of one of the others.What's the point of writing a completely unrelated prequel that contradicts a lot of what was written in the official canon? I can understand doing this if you have a good story to tell, but this story really wasn't that good. No, I take that back. The story isn't bad, in fact in the right hands it could be great. But it just didn't seem to work and it's hard to pin down why.The first problem is the Oz character himself (played by James Franco). He's just a very unlike- able protagonist. I know they were kind of going for a Han Solo/Jack Sparrow sort of scoundrel with a heart of gold, but he really didn't have any of the charm or humor that a character like that needs to have. Those types of characters are rarely used as protagonists, so maybe it wasn't all Franco's fault. But his performance is quite awkward at times which didn't help much.Probably the most interesting character was Theodora (played by Mila Kunis). Theodora's tragic character arc may have sounded great when it was pitched, but it wasn't exactly executed well. Mila Kunis is beautiful and youthful which does help in winning over sympathy from the audience. But, like James Franco, she seems a little awkward in this role. There's a major turning point for this character that just seems off and doesn't seem to work. I'll come right out and spoil it, basically she gets tricked into becoming the wicked witch of the west. I can see what they were going for, and again, in the right hands it could have been brilliant. But it felt rushed, poorly written, and the acting was mixed. Mila Kunis can act and had some great moments, but also some very bad moments in this film.Also her story is so tragic that I wonder if it's too hard a pill to swallow for young kids. Especially if they see the 1939 film after this one. In fact, it really puts a damper on the happy ending of the 1939 Wizard of Oz and really makes Oz look like a villain. If you remember, Oz sends Dorothy to kill The wicked witch of the west, and Dorothy pretty much does it without question. The witch never gets the chance to redeem herself and be restored to her former beauty. It makes Dorothy's quest look a lot less heroic and a lot more tragic. Did the writers of this movie intend this? At least Darth Vader had a redemption before he died. The poor witch was under an evil spell the whole time and had no control over her actions or fate for the decades between the events of this film and the 1939 film.Then you have Evanora, the other wicked witch, who seems to be just evil for evil's sake. She also doesn't wear the silver shoes (or ruby slippers if going by movie canon), which I felt was a missed opportunity. Instead she carries a locket which seems to keep her young and beautiful, although it's never really explained (nor is Theodora's sudden awful reaction to contact with water).The rest of the characters are okay. Glinda the good witch is pretty, kind and good natured if not somewhat boring, but it kind of fits her character so I can't complain. You have the flying monkey who's the cute comic relief, but he's really not that funny. The China Girl is also cute and precious and nicely animated. But there's no one here that's really all that memorable.It's a film that seems like it could have been good with a better script and better performances. Everything seems so serious, which is a little awkward considering the over the top fantasy world the characters inhabit. There's some humor, but a lot of it falls flat, and it's not enough to really make it entertaining or make the characters memorable. With the dull performances it would have been nice to have a song here and there like the 1939 film to liven the mood. But nope. No songs, except for one munchkin sung theme that was cut short.Honestly they could have done much better if they borrowed some of the imaginative plots from the later Oz books. Unlike the books there's little to no social commentary. The fantasy world relies more on nostalgic references to the 1939 film than to any of the thoughtful allegory or economic / political commentary that made the books so culturally relevant.That being said, the visuals were fantastic and the final battle at the end is fun to watch. It had potential, but ultimately didn't deliver anything great. 6/10",Oz the Great and Powerful
181,tlooknbill,CGI'ed China Girl doll gets my best actor vote.,7,21 March 2013,"That character, the winged bellhop monkey and the immersive dreamlike experience provided by the brilliant set design are worth the price of admission. I saw it in a digital theater and the color was gorgeous. A very trippy movie somewhat on the same level as ""Avatar"" who share the same set designer.If you liked the improvements in the more lifelike CGI'ed qualities imbued into ""The Hobbit""s Gollum character compared to the ""Lord Of The Rings"" version, then China Girl will about make you cry and then laugh and connect on a whole other emotional level you wouldn't have expected. I didn't expect it. It was downright unsettling to the point I couldn't get her out of my head the rest of the movie. She made the human actors appear flat and uninteresting by comparison. I didn't even care about the movie plot after seeing this doll. I swear! And I wasn't the only one in the audience that felt this. There was a 50-ish year old woman wiping the tears from her eyes two seats down from me. The entire audience was hushed, even the children which the theater was packed with. I was getting chills and a lump in my throat watching this doll. And the winged bellhop monkey was probably the best supporting actor. James Franco's character immediately receded into the background as some grinning ninny jock acting in his first high school play. Talk about upstaged! Unfortunately there are very few scenes with the doll and the monkey for obvious reasons.Go see it for the dreamlike immersive experience and the CGI'ed characters. The plot and the human characters are pretty predictable which is why I gave it a 7 out of 10 rating.",Oz the Great and Powerful
182,dndcullens,Not THAT bad,7,26 January 2014,"Sometimes you hear about how bad a movie is, how the critics hated it, how it failed at the box office, etc. etc. etc. And then you find it in the bargain bin and you decide to see how bad it really is. This was the case with a number of movies (like COWBOYS V ALIENS and that one about the civil war guy sent to Mars) and in some cases (like the two mentioned) they turn out not as bad as people make out. This is the same as OZ THE GREAT AND THE POWERFUL. I watched it with my daughter and we both thoroughly enjoyed it. There was just enough humour, action and a little bit of scary o keep you entertained for the however long it took to watch it. It just goes to prove that you never judge a whatever by its thingy. Now the reverse can also be true (as in the case of AVATAR) as a movie everyone loved can be a piece of crap. So if you are wondering what you are in for if you decide to watch it, I think you are in for a good action adventure. It is not THE WIZARD OF OZ but rather a cross between THE HOBBIT and a Jim Carey movie..errr..I think. There are a few scary bits but nothing that would frighten kid over 8. So overall not as bad as it was made out to be and, yep, I would be up for a sequel.",Oz the Great and Powerful
183,haosstoposto,A beautiful prequel to an all time classic,9,22 March 2013,"Visually very interesting movie from the opening till the end. To make it short, it is a story about a real world magician at the beginning of 20th century and his adventures in the magical fantasy land of Oz. Most of us have seen the Wizard of Oz from 1939 or at least heard about it and this story is a prologue. Some viewers are criticizing the cast but I believe they fit their characters nicely. James Franco is superb as a magician/ladies man/con artist Oscar Zoroaster Phadrig Isaac Norman Henkel Emmannuel Ambroise Diggs. Some actors which have been considered for this role(Johnny Depp, Robert Downing Jr.) are in my opinion already too much known in some other iconic roles (Jack Sparrow, Sherlock/Ironman) and fresh faces can contribute much to the new characters. As for the ladies, Mila Kunis as Theodora, Rachel Weisz as Evanora, and Michelle Williams as Glinda fit perfectly to their characters. Theodora is naive young girl with tragic destiny who gets disappointed in men so she becomes the evil witch (as often happens in real life), Rachel Weisz is perfect as ice-cold and manipulative Evanora and Michelle Williams embodies the purity of good witch Glinda. Many critics consider this story to be simple and by-the-numbers, but honestly, we can say the same thing for the original Wizard of Oz, and it does not matter a bit. The main strength of both movies is sense of wonder and hearth-warming characters we care about. All in all I enjoyed this movie very much and recommend it for all.",Oz the Great and Powerful
184,TheConnoisseurReviews,"""Oz the Great and Powerful"" Review",7,12 March 2013,"""Oz the Great and Powerful"" deals with the themes of believing and how powerful faith can be. The story handles the theme very well with clever writing and homages to the older film (keep in mind that this is a prequel to the actual story and not the 1939 classic film by MGM). Sam Raimi does a good job of directing the film. He mixes humor with the more semi-serious moments. There are moments of excitement that gets the blood going and legitimately scary moments that make you jump out your seat. However, the story mainly in the middle gets a bit confused on what it is about and what's happening. Along with that, certain things feel a bit rushed particularly when Oz arrives in Oz.The acting and characters for the most part are decent. Oz, James Franco, is pretty much the scene stealer as one would hope from a movie titled ""Oz."" Franco brings a lot of charisma and charm to the character along with being relatable. He sometime goes a bit over the top, but when he puts on his big cheesy smile almost everything is forgiven. Mila Kunis is okay in the movie at best, but half way through she become not so good. Her character feels forced and any emotion she tries to convey comes off as trying too hard. There's a flying monkey and little porcelain girl that bring a lot of the heart to the film. They're incredibly likable and help show off some of the humanity in Oz.I particularly like the visual effects. The backgrounds are well detailed and immerses the viewer into the world. There are some moments were you can tell it's CGI and the character don't blend well with the background, but they don't appear very often. The musical score by Danny Elfman is effective, but not too memorable until the third act.Overall, ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" isn't great, but it is still pretty good. The special effects are great, but have some spotty moments, the score my Elfman is solid, and James Franco's performance steals the show. However, there are some minor story issues in the first two acts and the acting by the rest of the cast, especially Mila Kunis, leaves more to be desired. The final act of the film is spectacular though and sums up everything great about the film incredibly well. I give it an incredibly high 3.5/5, acting could use some work, but Franco and the third act make this a really good experience.",Oz the Great and Powerful

I just decided to check on this one now because of what people said, but still with a huge dose of skepticism. Sadly, my skepticism was warning me.I mean, really, what's this guys? Does everybody nowadays have to be an obnoxious character? Geez... what horrible people this movie have, horrible, horrible people! Are you expecting me to root for them? No freakin' way, sir! I still remember Dorothy from the 39 movie, you know, that innocent little farm girl, has good intentions, likable, the proverbial born with a heart o'gold. This Oz character is a complete ass, arrogant, expendable, a real douche! The kind of fella that you wouldn't regret to throw off a cliff. What a nuisance! I know that they tried to do as the hero's journey, you know, the kind of everyday fella who goes to a transformation and becomes something else in the end of his journey, but seriously, I just didn't buy it this time. Also, I sensed as they were trying to do a kind of prelude to the 1939 movie, but it went on very bad. And as for the pace, Jesus, it's rushed as hell! The guy just arrived at Oz and all of a sudden he's on the job! I mean, c'mon, spare me a nickel here! Where's the backstory? It's just the bare minimum to make the plot go, that's it!However, it's not as bad as I thought it'd be. The ending is predictable and some backgrounds just scream ""fake"" in your face, but despite that, it's heartwarming and nice enough to spend some time. But just because of the metalanguage portions of the film, especially in the end of the movie when the face of Oz goes ginormous with the blue smoke and the cinematographer they built... seriously, how could they built that in the land of Oz and so quickly?? Makes no sense. Alas, there are a lot of plot holes in the movie and moments that you just go ape$ɦǐt with the lack of consistency.Hence, I consider this an average flick but just for a very short mileage of consistency. Worth to look once and that's it. Then you just return to Kansas with little Dorothy and her dog Toto, in 1939, a year that might not have the advanced special effects of today but still delivered a much better and believable story based in the L. Frank Baum book, loved and cherished by all until today.",Oz the Great and Powerful

188,markdroulston,I wish it was all a dream,2,11 March 2013,"A piece of advice for anyone thinking about seeing Oz: The Great and Powerful: the further you can get from the majestic 1939 masterpiece The Wizard of Oz, the more chance you stand of having a good time with the prequel.For those of us that feel a strong connection to the original film, Disney's first big release of the year is a trite, overloaded bog of cloying CG, nauseating characters, and a needlessly dark tone that betrays of the innocence of a world so many of us grew up with.It's nothing new to observe that many of the big summer pictures of the last decade or so have leaned towards a darker tone, and it's also not necessarily a bad thing. What I'm going to suggest is that the technique doesn't necessarily have to be employed in every case, and certainly not for something like this.I simply want to ask why we are forced to endure the suggested genocide of a race of people (the porcelain villagers of China Town), or the corseted, sexed-up Wicked Witch of the West (Mila Kunis) threatening that the Yellow Brick Road, a symbol only associated with goodness and joy, will run red with the blood of Oz's fair citizens.Because it's 2013, and people demand darkness in their beloved children's tales? Where is it written that simplicity and purity can't be part of a successful film anymore?Why does the arrival of Oz (a leering and feckless James Franco) himself have to be tied up to some tacked on prophecy? It's a completely unnecessary plot point that adds nothing to the character or the film. Due to the cultural footprint of the original, even people who may not have seen it in a long time, or ever, are probably familiar enough with the story that we know how this film is going to play out.There was no prophecy about Dorothy's trip to Oz to defeat the Witch, each of the supporting characters had their motivation set up in little more than a sentence or two, and it's hard to deny that story turned out pretty well. The simplicity of the story is what worked.Why, why, does Oz: The Great and Powerful need not one, but two ridiculous sassy sidekick characters? A neurotic flying monkey played by Zach Braff doing his best Woody Allen impression is cute enough until certain shots reveal some ghastly, flat CG work on his face. And the sooner we can free ourselves of Tony Cox's wise-cracking dwarf schtick the better. It's a character that we've seen over and over again, and am I crazy or is having a character exist for no reason other than so people can laugh at someone different from themselves more than a little offensive?The tornado that serves as the catalyst for this atrocious movie's plot just may have been whipped up by L. Frank Baum and Victor Fleming furiously rolling in their graves. Oz: The Great and Powerful is gaudy, tonally inconsistent, over-written nonsense that does its best to tarnish the legacy of one of the all-time classics, a film that will make you wish you could click your heels together and transport yourself out of the cinema, realising it was only a horrible dream.tinribs27.wordpress.com",Oz the Great and Powerful

192,DrewAlexanderR1,A Perfect Prequel,8,14 August 2015,"Oz the Great and Powerful tells the story of how the great wizard Oz from the Wizard of Oz came to be. It follows the young Oz (James Franco) as he is swept away to an enchanted land ending up in the middle of a power struggle between three witches. The young Oz is a trickster who deceives those he wants and/or needs for his own ends. This attitude has consequences and those consequences are what drives the story forward.James Franco plays the young Oz brilliantly. The character is a shallow small time magician and the story shows how he comes full circle to be the Great and Powerful Oz from the Wizard of Oz. Unfortunately, his change happens after taking a grievous toll. The three witches who Oz comes to affect are Theodora (Mila Kunis), Rachel Weisz (Evanora), and Glinda (Michelle Williams). The three play their parts and give great performances to add to their resumes. For those who watched and loved the Wizard of Oz in their childhood, this movie is the perfect prequel. Watching it as an adult was a treat. The writers did well to adapt the script to make it a worthy prequel. In addition, the movie does well to entertain both children and adults. It slots in perfectly as the precursor to the Wizard of Oz. The film didn't have the best reception but I encourage you to ignore this. The directing is probably the weakest link in this movie, but the story and actors more than makeup for this. The character development is amazing and shows exactly why things were they way they are in the Wizard of Oz. Simply stated Oz the Great and Powerful is truly a prefect prequel.",Oz the Great and Powerful
193,stephenrtod,Very Uneven Quality in General and Pacing in Particular,6,18 April 2013,"Anyone who treasures the 1939 hit, ""The Wizard of Oz,"" knows that Frank Morgan played the Wizard as a lovable albeit rather bumbling con man with a very good heart. James Franco plays the role as redemptive therapy, and Sam Raimi's dove-tailing movie makes a strong point that all of us are better than we think; in a crisis, many people do rise to their true potential. Raimi's film could have done more with that motif.I thought the movie was strong in the beginning and excellent in the latter part. In between, there were very slow-moving and slow-developing scenes that should have been either (a) truncated (b) sped up considerably or (c) edited to tighten them up. At two hours and eleven minutes, the film is about 30 minutes too long, I think.If I looked at the script, I could point out four or five lines that simply fell flat, just did not work.You cannot blame actresses and actors if the lines they have to deliver lack panache, style, impact, or memorability. Franco has to rely on his trademark toothy grin far too much to cover the absence of a good line, remark, rejoinder or speech.At the same time, I think that Sam Raimi put many good ingredients into this cinematic mix. The ingenious plan leading up to the final battle with the evil witches is indicative of what should have been the consistent quality throughout the movie.Some scenes such as the discovery and repair of the porcelin doll were too elaborate and slow moving.I thought that Mila Kunis did a very good job contrasting her good/bad personas; after biting the green apple, she was truly terrifying, and continued to be scary through to the end of the movie.Rachel Weisz was excellent, the most consistently high quality performer in the movie, channeling more depth than is usually exhibited in evil witches.I have to wonder why talented actors and actresses of the calibre of James Franco and Michelle Williams would agree to appear in a movie like this. A chance to work with Raimi would be enough. The challenge of playing a character type they have not tackled before, would provide great incentive for someone who is primarily interested in sharpening his or her craft; Williams and Franco are of that calibre. Weisz is one of the most self-motivating, high quality actresses working steadily today in Hollywood; she is driven from within, and she's good in every story on screen.I like the way Rami's film is not really a supplement to the 1939 classic; but, moreover, more of a dove-tailing piece, laying more detailed groundwork for the character development of Biggs, in the beginning, and hinting that the story has only begun to unfold at the conclusion of this movie.I liked the organization of Glenda's people into farmers, munchkins and tinsmiths. That approach was very refreshing and their ensuing teamwork with the Wizard provided a prolonged rather ingenious series of memorable scenes. The entire movie should have been of that quality.I have been watching, studying and reviewing movies for a long time, and I am concerned about movies that are rushed to theatres before they are ready. I'd be curious to know what test audiences liked and did not like, and how Raimi responded.Great films begin with a great story line. Then, excellent writing can make the most difference, not instead of a great story, but along with one. Finally, good acting cannot supplant a weak screenplay, nor can it buttress mediocre writing. Both the story and the writing in Raimi's movie exhibit slow spots and weak spots, and these should have been remedied before the film was sent to theatres.At the same time, I enjoyed the film, and I would recommend it to others. I'd give it two and a half stars using the conventional and most common rating system, by which I mean that it shows much promise. It is not a bad movie. It's just not consistently a good movie. The parts of it that are excellent indicate to me that the entire work of art could have been excellent. The trouble is that if a movie makes an overall profit over costs, that is often deemed acceptable. In my estimation, Hollywood cranks out two or three great movies a year. The rest are simply ""OK."" The suits, the money people seem quite content with that. I could not help but remember the absolute commitment to the role that Judy Garland, Ray Bolger, Frank Morgan, Jack Haley,and Bert Lahr injected into the 1939 vehicle. Those artists fully inhabited their roles.Many such memorable moments occurred in this movie, and it could have been a great film with a little more patience and painstaking care.What Hollywood just doesn't get is that people will go to see the movies that are adequate, but they crave great stories with great writing and great acting. Is that difficult to do? Of course. If it were easy, anyone could do it.",Oz the Great and Powerful

Sam Raimi, man who worked his way up with the cult horror series Evil Dead, started the trend of comic book movies with the classic Spiderman trilogy, proves once again what a magnificent filmmaker he is. I have never seen Wizard of Oz from 1939 and I know that the Americans get quite crazy about it and consider it a national treasure. In Europe though this film isn't that well known and popular. But still Raimi manged to make the the land of Oz very entertaining and appealing to me. 1905. Carny magician Oscar Diggs (James Franco), called by his friends OZ for short, is transported from Kansas to the Land of Oz, where he is taken for the wizard who is prophesied to save the realm from the Wicked Witch. The sisters Evanora (Rachel Weisz) and Theodora (Mila Kunis) send him on a deadly quest to kill the Wicked Witch which brings him into contact with Glinda the Good (Michelle Williams), flying monkeys, and a china doll.James Franco plays the fast-talking ladies man, hustling his customers and co-workers at the circus in Kansas. His assistant Frank (Zach Braff) is being humiliated by his master at all occasions and generally not being treated well. Oz even tells him that he is just his ""trained monkey"". Turns out that in the land of Oz I bet James Franco must have had rough time acting with three beautiful actresses. First the elegantly fiendish, green-gowned Rachel Weisz as Evanora always scheming with her sister Theodora (Mila Kunis) against always dressed in white Glinda the Good (Michelle Williams)who is a very powerful witch but very oddly passive. Since she is the good one she doesn't have much material to stand out among the other leading ladies who give one of their greatest performances.Finally this is a true family film, not unlike those where in the marketing claims the film is for kids but in the end when you watch the film you feel like the kids can't get all those jokes. This is a great story where ever family member can enjoy the whole film not just find one thing or character in the film to relate to.At the end of this review all I can say is: Go and watch this film in cinema! It's truly worth it. Amazing special effects, great actors, all wrapped in a fun, colorful and surprising movie filled with numerous twists (that is if you haven't seen the 1939's Wizard of Oz, I'm sure if I would have seen that film I would have this film spoiled}.P.S.

196,lothos-370-690020,Another CGI fest,4,5 April 2013,"Disney now seems to excel at mass producing films with fantastical special effects, but with absolutely no soul, no doubt why they bought Pixar. Here is another example where the story, what little there is plays second fiddle to the CGI. Mila Kunis for example, main character right? can anyone please explain to me why, half way through, when she is transformed into the wicked witch, btw everyone over 9 saw coming, we are treated to another CGI character instead of the very capable actress in makeup. Mila looks more like Margaret Hamilton, than her CGI doppleganger. Isn't the purpose of CGI to do things that we can't do otherwise. Now it's the go to position for every lazy movie maker with enough cash. It's as if The more money these companies have the more they forget what makes a good movie. It's not special effects, it's not a cast of millions, it's not completely superficial glances in the general direction of the plot, it's WELL WRITTEN CHARACTERS AND STORY. Which brings me to my final point, Oz. I get that the aim was to create a flawed anti hero who finally redeems and exceeds his own expectations of himself, but he is a hugely dis-likable character throughout, and he is the lead character. Franco's performance, while successfully portraying a sleazy, dishonest conman, does so, I believe because he himself was not entirely invested in the role and an air of discomfort rolls off him throughout. He was definitely miscast. In addition he doesn't really learn anything, he simply finds a way to get everything he was promised on his arrival with the minimal risk to himself. A hero, even an anti hero should at least be likable and OZ wasn't. In fact by the end I was routing for the two evil witches because I felt Oz, the annoyingly soft spoken and underacted good witch and the dumbstruck citizens of Oz deserved them. If there's another prequel, lets hope it has those witches return with flying Baboons aplenty, sporting a whole host of kick ass spells with which to make a more interesting film, as they were by far the more interesting characters, and yes I'm including the CGI Baboons, give them speaking roles, and have them holding Franco and Raimi over a fire for half the film, I'll pay to see that.",Oz the Great and Powerful
197,amit_imt2002,"If you have kids, life is beautiful, if you don't, borrow a few and make a trip to Oz.",8,19 March 2013,"I warmed to the classic The Wizard of Oz quite late in life.The prospect of watching a fairytale with evil witches and a young girl in wonderland set to a musical format was not appealing.But when I did watch it with my 4 year old last year it was a revelation.Victor Flemings 1939The Wizard of Oz is one of those films that stands head and shoulders above the rest 80 years after its release and modern day technical wizardry still cannot hold a candle to its freshness and stunning beauty.So when a prequel to this all time great film arrives from Disney, riding on a 350 million dollar budget, the expectations are much higher than the gleaming emerald towers of the Land of Oz.Oz the Great and Powerful is a film that tries to be a worthy prequel and more importantly it tries to be an honest and good film that should entertain audiences all over the world, young and old, without becoming an unwitting victim of its technical excellence.It handsomely preserve the innocence and energy of the original while shrugging off the limitations of not being able to use several of the signature artifacts like the ruby red shoes and the black mole on the wicked witches chin which are property of Warner Bros.We meet Oz(James Franco) as a circus magician in Kansas, his ambitions to be a great in the Houdini mould show no signs of being fulfilled but he soldiers on, seducing every available country girl along the way.He is a real scalawag, and imagining the likes of Jonny Depp or Robert Downey junior in the role is easy but in the final analysis their immense star power may have robbed Oz of its unpredictability. His luck runs out in the circus and he finds himself escaping in a hot air balloon which gets caught up in a tornado and delivers him to the magical land of Oz.The color tone changes here from sepia to an exuberant Technicolor in the same strategy as the original.As Oz crash-lands into this improbably beautiful world, we meet Theodora( Mila Kunis) who is having coming of age issues with her witchiness ( new word alert!) and falls for the charms of Oz.There has been a prophesy that a wizard named Oz will arrive from the sky and take over the vacant throne of the emerald city.Oz finds himself in Oz and tentatively grabs this opportunity to fulfill his ambitions.Initially he is his dishonest self but slowly transforms into the wizard of Oz that we met 80 years earlier.To compensate for the missing Tin Man, The Scarecrow and The Cowardly Lion there is a flying monkey and an unbelievably beautiful talking china doll, who serve as sidekicks of Oz.When we meet this doll, she is sobbing, her legs have been broken by the evil witch, she fears she can't walk again.Oz pulls out a magic potion and makes her walk again.This magic potion is nothing but a humble bottle of glue.This is one of the minor charms of this film, it refuses to adopt on the grammar of ultraviolet video games which seem to have infected nearly every fairy tale remake of late.This china doll is a perfect foil to the sexed up Barbies that little girls play with.Oz tries to take several steps back and uses special effects to primarily create a magical land where the most amazing thing is the internal transformation of Oz the circus magician into the Wizard of Oz, the ruler of the most pure and innocent community of people which includes the endearing Munchkins(thankfully not a Warner property) and community of ingenious tinkerers modeled on the Amish people.Michelle Williams as Gilda the good witch is appropriately sweet and virginal, while Mila Kunis is more effective once she transforms into the green skinned Theodora flying around on a broom, its Rachel Weisz as the evil Evanora who is most interesting to behold, partly due to her immense beauty and partly due to her controlled performance.In the end Oz is a joyful celebration of human ingenuity and our ability to tap into our better nature.The lessons it holds for children are different from the original and perhaps more in touch with the zeitgeist of the times.The climatic trick that Oz pulls off, is droll and bloodless, its a piece of trickery that pays a tribute to cinema itself. I recently saw an interview of the famous atheist, Richard Dawkins where he was asked what would be his reaction be if God appeared in the sky with a long beard and said in a booming voice""I exist!"".Dawkins replied that he would be tempted to question this as a conjuring trick.Watching the climax of Oz I marveled at his foresight and erudition.To fully enjoy this very friendly film one has to leave the baggage of the originals greatness behind, which has the advantage of marinating in well deserved adulation for full 80 years. This version by Sam Raimi and Disney studios is a very wholesome family entertainer that only needs to tip its hat to the past and it does so with some panache.If you have kids, life is beautiful, if you don't, borrow a few and make a trip to Oz.",Oz the Great and Powerful
198,italo505,Oz the Underachiever,8,10 March 2013,"If I had to describe Oz: The Great and Powerful with one word, I would choose colorful. From the very pages from L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, to the classic 1939 The Wizard of Oz and now the spanking new movie produced by Disney and directed by Sam Raimi, one common denominator is how colorful and beautiful the land of Oz really is. Oz: The Great and Powerful begins with Oz (James Franco) in a black and white, cropped and confined screen where we learn what a phone this magician really is. He certainly is a smooth talker but, beneath the surface, he's just a regular guy who plays a few tricks from his bag that startle his audience if only for a few moments. His assistant is the key ingredient to his act and, without his help, there would really be no act. I found the opening black and white sequence quite frustrating since we are limited to see half of the screen instead of the whole widescreen effect. Not only was I waiting for the monotonous dialogue to be over and done with, I was also counting the minutes until I could see the whole picture after Oz makes it through to the incredible land of Oz where rainbows, beautiful landscapes and splashes of color filled my eyes. It's like watching a Zoloft commercial. I was marveling at the details of the fantastical world where he would be destined to became the Great and Powerful despite his lack of magic powers. He meets with Theodora (Mila Kunis) who is immediately enchanted by his looks and his goofy charms, then her manipulative sister Evanora (Rachel Weisz) back at the Emerald City palace and much later Glinda (Michelle Williams), the good Witch of the North. Along the way he meets up with a winged monkey named Finley (voiced by Zach Braff from Scrubs) and a China Girl (Joey King), a porcelain doll that he finds along the Yellow Brick Road. I particularly loved China Girl. I think that the real wizards are the special effects team that created such a perfect little character that everyone immediately falls in love with: she's so fragile and innocent yet so feisty and full of courage that makes her so compelling to watch. I hope we get to see a spin off story solely based on her and her China Town, destroyed way before Oz finds her. Of course what everyone is hoping to see is the Wicked Witch of the West, that iconic character that we've grown to respect and fear. When she makes her appearance in Oz The Great and Powerful, I could hear all the kids in the audience gasp in awe and sheer joy of finally meeting the meanest villain of them all. If you ever doubt this, just read my previous entry on 13 Evil Villains and you'll see what I mean... Unfortunately, I wished I could say the same thing for Oz. I read that Robert Downey, Jr. had been considered for the role of the Wizard before Raimi approached Franco to fill in those big shoes. It's not that he didn't learn his lines or that he didn't do what he was told to do. There's a certain unscripted charisma to the Wizard that cannot be taught. James Franco lacks charisma. He's merely getting by and delivering his lines as best as he can but that's not enough. It would have taken Robert Downey, Jr., Johnny Depp (also considered for the role by the director), or Christoph Waltz, or Hugh Jackman to really deliver the lines of the Wizard who lacks magical powers but has so much personality to spare. I also had a problem with the lack of musical numbers that made The Wizard of Oz such a classic film. We had a short glimpse of a musical number by the Munchkins until someone ruined it for us... Oh, yeah, that was thanks to the Great and Powerful Oz himself. I tell you, Oz kept ruining it for me and I wished he had less and less screen time. The only moment where I actually didn't mind him so much is when he puts a show to defeat the witches and allows everyone to help him become Great and Powerful. No matter what I say, everyone wants to see the film and judge it for themselves. Go right ahead, your inner Munchkin will have a heckuva good time. Whether you catch it in 3D or in 2D, you will agree that the wizardry is really the people behind the curtain that made this Land of Oz as colorful and magical as we could ever hope for.",Oz the Great and Powerful
199,RocketeerFlyer,Wonderfully SWEET NATURED & Packed with GOODNESS,8,3 July 2013,"""The Wizard of Oz"" is a True Classic and whilst i'm sure there are some miserable people out there that don't like it I have yet to meet one.With the success of ""Wicked"" I guess it was obvious some kind of film was heading our way and so Halla Kazaaamm ""OZ: The Great & Powerful"" was created and not the film version of ""Wicked"" as expected.Sadly it's probably TOO Sweet Natured, Charming & packed with GOODNESS for today's audiences, personally I feel we've needed a film like this for awhile & I enjoyed it a LOT.Sam Raimi is the Director...TICK, Perfect with some wonderful creative touches.Special Effects...TICK, It was a joy to return to the one & true OZ.Story...HMMM...Well, I had expected a little more (if i'm being honest) like many I feel this was perhaps the weak link in this film well this & part of the script at times.It really does resemble ""The Wizard of Oz"" Film but with different characters in the roles...Oz is similar to Dorothy (what is this place? & why am I here? whilst collecting characters in order to fufil his destiny) Finley the Monkey takes on the Scarecrow role. China Girl is perhaps a mixture of the Tin-Man & Cowardly Lion.Acting...TICK, although I do understand those that thought James Franco was perhaps miscast as Oz, I thought he grew into the role and come the end you were actually routing for him, showing his growth & understanding as a human being (having been helped by these otherworldly creatures)Zach Braff as Frank was OK, Zach Braff as Finley the Monkey was superb.Joey King as China Girl is JUST A JOY TO BEHOLD.Rachel Weisz as Evanora was difficult to gauge in the Trailer, was she GOOD or BAD or NEITHER? some may be surprised...she was EXCELLENT.Mila Kunis as Theodra has been slated by some on these reviews but I think it's a little harsh, a different actress may have been better in the role but honestly as THE Witch she's terrific.Now to MICHELLE WILLIAMS as Glenda she's been called bland, boring, ordinary & predictable here. She had in my opinion the most difficult role and she plays it to PERFECTION...She really is a delight here, Sweet as a Pea, Beautiful and key to helping Oz realise his potential.Special mention must go to BILL COBBS (I remember seeing him in a super but short-lived TV series called ""The Others"" track it down if you can you won't be disappointed) and as Master Tinker he's a joy designing all kinds of gadgets and contraptions for Oz....Loved his expression when there's a power shortage.If your wondering should I go for the 3D version or not? I would simply say this...GO GET IT NOW!!! the 3D adds wonderfully to your enjoyment.Overall then... Whilst the story & script is a little weak & some might not like some of the casting I felt it to be an adorably sweet & good natured film that many young one's & families especially will fall in love with as did I.The Black & White opening in the 4:3 format might drive some crazy especially as it's in this format for longer than expected but honestly with the 3D it works a treat especially when the WIDESCREEN REVEAL is shown (every bit the equal of the original's B/W to Colour Reveal)I was enchanted & I loved the familiar ending. Yup it's NOT perfect but how many films are? This is the story they went with, if you go along with it & except it you'll have a whole deal of fun with it.A LOVELY SWEET NATURED, FUN & Packed with GOODNESS FiLM 8/10",Oz the Great and Powerful
200,jasonpachar,Decades in the Making,10,26 June 2014,"It has been 74 years since the original movie made us believe in the magic of Oz and those red slippers on the feet of a Kansas girl by the name of Dorothy Gale (RIP Judy Garland may you ever be missed for your dedication). So what do we know, we know that Dorothy travels to Oz to help free the kingdom from the clutches of the Wicked Witch of the West, but do we know why? Do we know who the Wizard was? Do we know why he even came to the Land of Oz? This movie answers all the questions you want to know about the Great and Powerful Oz. We do know that there are 3 witches – Glinda, the Good Witch (played beautifully by Michelle Williams), Evanora, the true Wicked Witch who later becomes the Wicked Witch of the East (played wonderfully by Rachel Weisz) and the creation from Evanora her sister Theodora who first greets Oscar who later becomes the Wicked Witch of the West (played by the awesome Mila Kunis). Evanora & Theodora conspire together to bring Oz to his knees, but it is him who separates the two women, I mean witches and restores all peace to the land.Now I have to give props to the man behind Oz, James Franco, he did an incredible job portraying the Great Wizard, but it was Sam Raimi who brought us all three Spider-Man movies that was the true Wizard. Thank you Sam for reminding us that 74 years ago the magic still lives on in 2013.",Oz the Great and Powerful
201,zurnd,Baum Would Be Proud,10,13 March 2013,"I've always been a fan of The Wizard of Oz. Throughout my childhood, every time the original 1939 film was on TV, it was like an event. I just had to watch it every time it was on, otherwise, I would be saddened, for I would have to wait a long while before it was on television again. I know I'm not the only one who dealt with this problem, for The Wizard of Oz is a staple is many people's lives and for a lot of people, it was the first film they were introduced too. Over the years, my infatuation with the land of Oz grew to prominent proportions. In my teen years, I read the original book written by Lyman Frank Baum and discovered cult classic films such as The Wiz and Return to Oz. But how I longed for a film that carried on in the heart and spirit of the original masterpiece. Today, I'm proud to say that I have found that film in Sam Raimi's Oz The Great and Powerful, a thrilling and chilling flick with attitude and might. Never before have I seen an Oz film like this and even if the original still remains the crowning jewel of the Oz films, this one comes dangerously close, for Uncle Walt's long awaited Oz flick is finally here and boy, does it deliver on many levels!For one thing, this film is very much like the original we all know and love. It starts out in black and white and in 4:3 Academy ratio and transits to color and 2.35:1 once we reach the land of Oz. Although this film is not a musical, there is one part of the film that involves a bit of music, which is almost a complete throwback to the classic MGM film. The Wicked Witch of the West says something very similar to ""I'll get you my pretty"" and when she cries, her tears leave burn marks on her face, foreshadowing her demise from a bucket of water. Many of the film's environments and settings also look very reminiscent to the environments and settings in the original MGM film, such as the Kansas prairies, Oz's cornfields, even the Munchkin village with the semi-swirly design of the Yellow Brick Road. Even if Disney couldn't use the trademarks from the 39 film (because it's owned by Ted Turner), they did a pretty good job of making the film feel authentic enough to be a prequel to that film, whether you wish to make it that or not. The acting has gotten it's share of criticism, but I think it's pretty spectacular. James Franco's take on the Wizard of Oz (Oscar Diggs) is very similar to Frank Morgan's portrayal of the wizard and his Kansas counterpart, Professor Marvel in the 39 film. In fact, it almost seems like Oscar Diggs and Professor Marvel are the exact same character. Mila Kunis was fairly good as Theodora the Good Witch, who would later become the threatening Wicked Witch of the West after taking a bite out of an heart draining apple. Some have said that her take on the green witch, who was made famous by Margaret Hamilton, was over the top and overdone, but I think that's what I liked most about her performance. She delivers a much younger, yet conniving take on the Wicked Witch, before her face gets wrinkly and she grows a chin mole. Rachel Weisz was top notch as Evanora, the Wicked Witch of the East, who hearkens back to the dreaded evil queen from Disney's Snow White. And Michelle Williams as Glinda (the Good Witch of the South in this film) comes off as a sweet heartish, kindly mother figure like she was originally intended to be.One of the other things I loved about this picture is that it not only borrows elements from the beloved 39 film, it also mashes in elements from L. Frank Baum's original Oz novels. In the original WOO book, Dorothy and her crew entered a town where all it's inhabitants were made of porcelain. In this film, the town is represented in the character of the China Girl, whose legs are broken off at first, but repaired with glue after Oz finds her. The field of poppies are poisoned to begin with and don't require the Wicked Witch to put a spell on them. As I said before, Glinda is the Witch of the South just as she was in the original book, and she not only rules over the Munchkins, but the Quadlings as well. And this film successfully captures L. Frank Baum's non violent beliefs, for the film's climatic ending battle is done through illusion and the ""flying baboons"" rip apart scarecrows instead of actual humans. This film really made me feel like a little kid again. Watching it, memories of setting eyes to the original Wizard of Oz for the first time resurfaced and although I still keep that film close, I absolutely loved this flick and I consider it the best film of 2013 as of right now. It's an overall beautiful, entertaining, thrill ride that I will be looking forward to seeing again in the near future. Hopefully, in the sequel, they can incorporate other elements from Baum's novels like kalidahs, hammerheads, field mice and witches with eye patches. But in the sequel, leave out scary witch transformations! The ones in this films are frightening, especially for the kiddies. Then again, blue flying monkeys like the ones in the original are pretty scary as well.",Oz the Great and Powerful
202,TheFunkyBass,"It was okay, but it could have been a LOT better.",5,18 November 2013,"This prequel told the story of the Great and Powerful Oz and how he became The Wizard Of Oz.The backstory to some of the characters were pretty bad. In the beginning of the film, Oz promised he would change, which implied he'd stop being a womanizer. But he was eventually hitting ON THE 3 WITCHES. Theodora had the worst backstory, she just went completely evil after seeing Oz hiting on Glinda and eating a green apple.However, this film brought back some of the ""magic"" that the The Wizard Of Oz from 1939 left behind, like the scene where Oz meets the China Girl. The CGI made the world of Oz come to life with colorful landscapes.It was also nice to see some references to the 1939 film. Like the cowardly lion, the scarecrow and some of the Wizard's tricks. I would've liked to see or at least hear a reference to Evanoras' ruby slippers.Overall, it was okay, not terrible, but not recommendable either.",Oz the Great and Powerful
203,misterembryo,Pure OZsomeness,10,8 March 2013,"Oz the Great and Powerful joins the ranks of Avatar and Life of Pi in creating a world so vivid and immersive, you would be doing yourself a disservice to wait for DVD. There is no other way to watch it than in IMAX 3D. I was smiling from ear to ear from one sequence to the next, surprises at every turn, a Disney attraction within itself. Literally from the very beginning. The opening title sequence is one of the most impressive showcases of 3D I've seen. It's as wondrous, if not more so, as the dazzling world in Tim Burton's Wonderland, only with more memorable characters and a better story.The true wizard behind the emerald curtain is master director Sam Raimi. He is one of the most versatile directors around, and what he has created here is one of the scariest, funniest, and most charming Disney movies in recent memory. Raimi brings a little Evil Dead demon magic to scenes designed to frighten you. Thankfully his mastery in horror is equaled by his comedic timing, so the little pretties who watch the movie will be able to sleep at night. Finley is the most adorable flying monkey in a bellhop costume you'll ever meet, and the porcelain China doll is a roller-coaster of emotions, broken one minute and quick to show you she's not so fragile the next. They are both beautifully animated and voiced to perfection. Sometimes you wish animated characters can win Best Supporting Actor (ahem- Gollum!).To use this much special effects but still create the atmosphere of a vintage Technicolor classic is an astounding achievement. Like the opening sequence, there are scenes shot with the aesthetic of a paper doll puppet show, or that French Trip to the Moon movie (like the Smashing Pumpkins Tonight, Tonight video). Other moments submerge you in a world of color, magic, and music (by Danny Elfman) like some kind of living, breathing Fantasia. Many scenes can easily be translated to a Disneyland thrill ride, or a spot on the laser-light Fantasmic spectacular. Whether or not that's done deliberately, who cares? It makes for a thoroughly entertaining movie.This movie tells the back story of the Great and Powerful Wizard of Oz before he was so Great and Powerful, when he was a lowly carnival magician named Oscar from Kansas. He could convince you to believe with mind-blowing illusions, but sadly isn't equipped with the stuff that Messiahs are made of. He is crooked and inconsiderate; he lies, cheats, and steals; he's pretty much everything a wizard-genie-messiah is not, and still you can't help but love the guy, which has lots to do with James Franco's natural likability.When he crash lands in Oz, he is forced to perform the greatest trick of all. He not only has to convince the citizens of Oz that he is the prophesied Great Wizard sent to restore harmony in the land, he also has to convince the three great witches of the realm, three women who not only possess power beyond words, but are also insanely beautiful, a dangerous combination that may be too much for a mere mortal to bear. A world like this demands a wizard whose predecessors include Merlin, Gandalf, and Dumbledore. This wizard's heroes are Houdini and Thomas Edison, and for now that will have to do. Sam Raimi, Ang Lee, James Cameron, Peter Jackson, and Joss Whedon are all wizards in their own right, reminding us there are still reasons to see a movie at the movie theater.",Oz the Great and Powerful
204,kxok630,Follow the yellow brick road ...in the opposite direction,3,27 June 2013,"The classic Oz gets butchered again with this lame attempt to expound upon the original story. The only thing to entice anyone to watch this is the poor tie-in with characters of the original. Nothing here would ever stand on its own, and this movie should descend rapidly into forgotten obscurity.It's a prequel. That alone should raise red flags after the regrettable Starwars prequels, and the red flags are justified. Like other prequels, it exploits the names and goes running off in odd directions that don't fit with the original story it's supposed to connect to. It rips off Wicked with the young witches and their widening rift routine, and does it poorly. Mila Kunis, in particular, looks completely confused as to what her character is supposed to be doing or feeling.No character will evoke your sympathy or interest, because the story and approach never give you any reason to care. Apparently, the director thought if you use names like Glenda from the original, that will be enough. It's not. Be warned: any resemblance to characters and story lines from the 1939 is purely non-existent. A cheap attempt by the movie makers to absorb money without earning it.",Oz the Great and Powerful

That's what the wizard says in the 1939 classic (and the book before it) when Dorothy & gang come before his throne.This movie just has a terrible script. Terrible lead actor (Oh if only Johnny Depp or Robert Downey Jr had said Yes!). Mediocre acting from others -- except Rachael Weisz - more Brits please! and fewer American TV ensemble actors from shows about troubled teens.The CGI/special effects are wonderful. I nearly plugged in my earbuds and put a white noise track on my MP3 player. So I wouldn't have to listen to the terrible script/acting and could just concentrate on the pretty pictures. Every joke went over like a lead balloon -- not a lovely hot air balloon. No one in my theater laughed at one of them.

206,champjohnson29,An appropriate prequel,7,8 March 2013,"When I first saw the teaser trailer, I was very excited but as time went on and started listening to people's opinions I got a little scared to see this film. Then I read some early reviews on here and was really shaking in my boots but I saw it anyways to form my own opinion. I really enjoyed this movie. I also went in expecting nothing so I believe that made me enjoy it more.I was always curious as to how The Wizard came to be in power if he was a fraud, so I was anxious to see how the story played out. I enjoyed the way the acting and theme was reminiscent of the original movie. James Franco wasn't terrible to watch but I'm convinced that someone else could have played the role much better. But I think the award goes to Mila, Michelle and Rachel for great performances as the main witches in our story. All of their performances stole the show. Mila Kunis and Rachel Weisz especially. Also, I'm always interested in costuming and the set design and they both were beautiful to watch. Overall, the movie was a bit corny but it needs to be in order to capture some of the essence of the old classic. Most of the funny parts were not really funny but I'm thankful for the characters ""Finley"" and ""China Doll"" because they saved the film from a lack of comedy. I think everyone's story played out perfectly and although, in the end, you know what's going to happen to it's enjoyable to watch it play out. I would recommend for anyone to go see this movie, it's definitely an enjoyable film. Now, I'm hoping that they remake the Wizard of Oz because I want to see the story play out again.",Oz the Great and Powerful
207,nycruise-1,"Great ""Oz"" movie! But maybe too ""Ozzy"" for today's audiences?",8,10 March 2013,"Well - yes - this cannot compare to the 1939 movie. But NOTHING will ever come close to the 1939 movie.That said, ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" is a very clever, well-made film that, in addition to pulling elements from both the original Oz books and the 1939 film, manages to come up with quite a few original and innovative story elements of its own regarding ""pre-Dorothy"" Oz - capable of holding its own against the novel/musical ""Wicked."" James Franco is great as ""O.Z."": the character of the Wizard - while portrayed in the 1939 movie as a lovable ""humbug"" - is more of a snarky, flimflam in the Oz books, and that certainly comes across in this movie.The China Doll is wonderful character inspired by a chapter in the original ""Wizard"" story that has never been realized in any previous Oz film: in that book, Dorothy and her trio stumble upon a land where everything is made of fine porcelain - or ""china."" (Obviously, with the expiration of the copyright of all of Baum's works, Disney had to come up with a character which is unique to ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" yet still maintains some sort of tie to Baum's Land of Oz.)There are also numerous jabs/dares when it comes to the 1939 movie. There is a glamorous wicked witch - which pays homage to the initial casting of 1930s Hollywood beauty Gale Sondergaard in the role of the Wicked Witch. There is also a bevy of dialogue that sounds ripped from the soundtrack of the 1939 movie - until such dialogue is fully delivered and you realize the phrase was either a line from the book or simply can stand on its own despite being uttered in the 1939 film (""I'll get you my pretty..."" and ""You put the 'merry' in the 'merry old Land of Oz"").The witches - good and wicked - are all wonderfully portrayed, and the sets are certainly much more visually appealing than Disney's last Oz-go-round ""Return To Oz"" (1985).The BIGGEST PROBLEM for many viewers boils down to the fact that the script remains extremely faithful to L. Frank Baum's vision of Oz: Baum's perspective is/was that of a writer in the early part of the 20th century. Consequently, there is strong ""pacifist"" aspect to this movie's portrayal of the Land of Oz and its people, which - without giving anything away - either may not sit well with contemporary viewers or else, perhaps more importantly, dilutes the potential for a ""slam-bang"" finish.Additionally, in Baum's original ""Wizard,"" the title character, whether in spite of or else because of his ""humbug"" background, was all about helping the Scarecrow, the Tin Man and the Cowardly Lion to realize that the goals they sought - a brain, a heart and courage - were mere token symbols for qualities already evident in these three characters (the Scarecrow, for instance, constantly figured out ways to overcome adversity while fighting the Wicked Witch of the West - yet, at the same time, he was always bemoaned the fact that he did not have a brain; likewise, the Tin Man cried at one point because he stepped on a bug and felt that such a ""cruel"" act would never have happened if he had a heart in the first place). Well, that attitude - ""It's what ya do what ya got"" (what Disney film first promoted that same notion??? BONUS POINTS if you can name it!) - permeates this film over and over. Consequently, the finale of this film may not be ""confrontational"" enough for many viewers, who like their Good/Evil battles to have more head-to-head violence.Ultimately, Baum's writing reflected the attitudes - and indeed maturity - of the collective American mindset of the early 20th century, when Americans were much more naive and innocent than today. (Seriously - the notion of a Fairyland whose inhabitants do not kill their enemies in order to survive was only possible in the years prior to WWI!) As such, ""Oz the Great and Powerful,"" may seem too ""juvenile"" and move too slow for contemporary viewers conditioned to the sagas of ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""Harry Potter.""On that note, it's probably wise to remember that the Oz books were the ""Harry Potter"" books of their time - albeit their longevity record outdoes Harry by a long-shot: over a hundred years. My advice: Don't expect ""Harry,"" DO expect BAUM and you'll be fine with this movie.",Oz the Great and Powerful

209,Eightiesjunkie,Oz the Great A$$hole!,1,15 August 2015,"A while back, a friend of mine recommended to me that I should watch this movie. So a few hours ago while channel surfing, I come across this movie playing on Syfy, due to my friends recommendation, I decided to check it out. Man, am I regretting that decision! Because aside from the visual effects, there was nothing good about this film! I didn't mind the fact that The Wizard (James Franco's character) started out as a sleazy magician/con man, or the fact that the wicked witch of the west started out as a kind hearted, innocent, girl. I don't mind the tweaking of a character's back story as long as it serves a purpose. Which is the film's biggest problem. There IS no purpose. As for the story and characters: There IS no story, There ARE no characters! Evanora and Theodora (Who become the wicked witches of the east and west) are two of the worst villains I've ever seen in my life. They're not scary, creepy, intimidating, or charismatic. (And that goes double for Mila Kunis's wicked witch of the west, who doesn't have so much as one tiny iota of the presence that Margaret Hamilton's wicked witch of the west had. However, that's just the tip of the iceberg. By far, the worst ""Character"" in this film is James Franco's Oz. From beginning to end, he is never even the LEAST bit likable! It would've have been fine had Franco's Oz been a washed-up magician, and his experiences in the land of Oz make him more confident in himself and his abilities, and therefore make him better than he ever thought he could be, but that's not what happens here. In fact, the only reason he goes along with the charade of being a ""Great and powerful Wizard"" is because he thinks it will get him somewhere. In the end, he does decide to help the defenseless people of Oz, but there is no reason for him to do it, nor is there a lead up to him becoming a better person and choosing to help Oz's citizens. He just does it, because the plot needs him to. This film is such a disappointment, and it's a shame! The visual effects are breathtakingly beautiful, most of the actors are extremely talented, and Sam Raimi is a brilliant filmmaker. He's made many films that I absolutely adore! Unfortunately, this isn't one of them. It's not Spider-Man 3 bad, but it's pretty close. Perhaps the next time I go DVD/Blu-Ray shopping, I'll pick up ""The Wizard of Oz"" and wash this movie's bad taste out of my mouth!",Oz the Great and Powerful
210,firefox2k,A very nice time in oz,7,9 March 2013,"I am not sure what some people were expecting when seeing this film. However the family and I really enjoyed this movie. It was very heart warming, funny, thrilling, and an overall joy for everyone. The family sat and discussed this movie for hours afterwards over dinner. I personally was glad that Johnny deep did not do this movie, simply because I would be sitting there comparing him to jack sparrow. I would recommend is movie to friends I with children. Do yourself a favor and please do not try and compare this to wizard of oz. just look at the movie as a fresh new adventure. I also recommend to get your tickets early to this film.

211,zaidmnomani,Pointless Prequel to a Beloved Film,5,1 May 2020,"Oz the Great and Powerful is a movie that I know is not that great in terms of film making, but I can't help but enjoy it. This is one of those movies that's so bad it becomes funny.The premise is certainly an idea that could be done well, but it's wasted with the painfully average script. All the characters are pretty flat and one-dimensional. This is especially true in the case of Theodora. Her character starts out as this naive girl who is pure good and only wants two things in life: absolute peace in all the kingdom and Oscar's love. Despite the fact that she barely spent a single day with him, she now loves him forever and wants to marry him.Then Oscar goes of to hunt down Glinda, and Evanora tells Theodora that he's cheating on her. She immediately accepts this suggestion without asking him about it, like some idiot. Then she starts crying, and her tears burn her skin. This is especially baffling. If water burns her skin even before she turns evil, then that means her skin burns whenever it touches water ever since she was a child. How does she go to the bathroom? How does she drink water? How does she urinate?Then Evanora offers her an apple, and in less than a minute her character turns into a complete polar opposite. She's now pure evil, she wants to do as many as bad things as possible, and she hates the wizard with all her heart (or what's left of it). And for some reason, she hates everyone else as well, even though she should only have a grudge against Oscar. I'm all for making the wicked witch more complex and tragic, but her fall into evil is so lazily written.And it does not help that Mila Kunis is terribly miscast in this film. Her acting is fine as a good witch, but when she turns evil she's about as intimidating as a grape. In fact, most of the actors are miscast. James Franco barely has any charisma whatsoever, which probably has something to do with the fact that his father died mid-production. Michelle is pretty forgettable and does not add anything new to the table. The only actress who fits the role is Rachel Weisz. She's hamming it up in the film, and she's fun to watch.What makes the film worse is the constant comedy and over reliance on CGI. Despite the stunning locations, it's hard to feel any sense of wonder at all. Maybe because everything feels so unrealistic and overly shiny. The side characters add nothing to the story other than terrible jokes. The production design is pretty good, but that's about it.Another problem is that, other than Oscar, none of the characters have an arc. I can't call Theodora's conversion into villainy an arc, as it happens so suddenly and out of the blue. It really sucks that the Wicked Witch of the West, the best character in the original film, is now nothing more than a teenager who is evil because her boyfriend cheated on her. All the female characters in this film are just tools to move the male protagonist forward.That being said, this film has some enjoyable parts. The third act is pretty fun and somewhat clever. Mila Kunis's performance is so bad at some points that it's actually pretty funny. But at the end of the day, this is yet another attempt for Disney to cash in on a beloved franchise by doing minimal work.",Oz the Great and Powerful
212,macub8,An interesting take,8,10 March 2013,As a child I always felt that there was not enough about the wizard in the original Wizard Of Oz I think that the screenwriters must have felt this too and decided to put pen to paper and bring it to the big screen. I was not disappointed at all it all works for me .There are references to the earlier film dotted throughout some so subtle that now you know they are there you can look out for them. The wizard Is superb as are all the cast I do not understand other reviews.. This film is more about a man finding his place and accepting his responsibilities to other people who rely upon him.it is about belief in yourself no matter what you encounter. In short go to the Cinema this has to be seen on the big screen and enjoy the fantasy and cgi landscape and effects and your questions about the Wizard will be answered,Oz the Great and Powerful

214,jeffrey-utley,There Was No Need For This Movie,5,9 July 2013,"Here comes the unneeded prequel they waited too long for to 'The Wizard of Oz', the 1939 sensation. A movie starring James Franco to tell us the story of the wizard and how he got to Oz using way too much CG I, boring story line, and bad acting. How about we do this.This movie didn't get a terribly negative rating because it did what it set out to do: Tell the wizard's story. It did that and used things from the 'The Wizard of Oz'. And I gotta say, some of the stuff in this movie was very cool, even though most of it was CG I stuff. There were many throwbacks from the first movie that did almost the exact same thing, which was actually a little too much. It was so much that it almost became low quality. The ending of this movie was good, but it disappointed me a little. In most of it there was something I hated, but I was able to get past it. There were some cool tricks in this movie that the characters did, because the wizard was a magician in real life. I enjoyed those things in it, but still, some were way too close to the original, so that was kind of bad, but a little cool. I think they could have gone without that though... Or they could have not overdone it so that it wasn't low quality and boring. I like that one better.This movie was also stupid, very slow-paced, and I also walked out of this movie almost hating it... Not in the middle, after it was over. That's when I walked out. Anyway, I decided to give a 5/10 because I decided that it was just meant to be a prequel and it did what it set out to do, so I had to give it credit for that. It also did have kind of cool parts, event though most of them were throwbacks from the original. The acting was very bad, and this movie was completely unfocused. It's like it was ten stories in one movie... Or twelve, but then it would be 'Movie 43'. But seriously, this movie almost switched to another story with a lot of different characters without even resolving the one before. I could have said it just made many twists and turns, but it went beyond that. Sometimes it even seemed like it switched the type of movie.This movie overall shows how everything became how it was, which was cool. That was another reason I didn't review this movie negatively. 5/10 isn't positive or negative. It's mediocre, but in a bad way. It's actually below the middle of the IMDb ratings, because it starts at one, so on my filled-in scale of the IMDb ratings, 5/10 is the negative side of mediocre ratings, and 6/10 is the positive side. Anyway, this movie could have been good, and an even higher budget wouldn't have done that. There's going to be a sequel for this, and for that they'll need better casting, writing, and directing.",Oz the Great and Powerful
215,zimmerblake,Sacrifices quality for name recognition,5,6 May 2017,"First off, this movie has loads of potential. Sam Raimi, known for his horror films, took a step out of his comfort zone in directing this movie and did very well. His presentation of the aesthetics of Oz is beautiful and what keeps the viewer watching. Michelle Williams is a delight and bright spot of the film's cast. While Rachel Weisz doesn't give you chills, she is serviceable as Evanora. All other supporting cast members fit quite well and make for what could have been a great movie. But then some other casting choices were made...I'm not sure if the producers thought having a ""young, cool"" actor and actress would help them target a wider range of moviegoers but whatever they were hoping for failed miserably. James Franco and Mila Kunis are plain awful. Franco is either high the entire film or is simply a frighteningly bad actor. Everything he does is awkward, forced and painful to watch. Kunis' attempt to be ""evil"" is hilarious and the only thing that stops you from laughing is when she screams, as it sounds like an old blender tossed in a wood chipper and causes your ears to hurt. Nothing she does comes off as wicked in the least and the script doesn't help. Maybe if they had better lines Franco and Kunis could seem interesting but their acting abilities leave much to be desired. Supposedly, Robert Downey Jr passed on the role of Oz and though he made the right choice given the script, he would've been so much better at bringing the lovable con-man to life. The climactic scene near the end is pretty exciting as you think you may enjoy how the film wraps up. Psych! James and Mila have to act again. Ending ruined.",Oz the Great and Powerful
216,sschimel,Not since The Blue Bird,1,18 March 2013,"I had thought that Alice In Wonderland and Willie Wonka (both with Johnnie Depp) had been the worst fantasy movies since The Blue Bird. But I was wrong. This movie is now officially my choice for worst fantasy movie since the debacle that was The Blue Bird. I like all of the actors but they are uniformly horrible. And James Franco is just wrong for his part. I've read that Robert Downy, JR was originally supposed to play Oz and he would have been a better choice. Franco is just too nice. And none of the women turn in good performances. Also, there are too many evil witches. The only character that came off well is China Girl. I hated this movie.",Oz the Great and Powerful
217,Cs_The_Moment,A Refreshing Take on a Much-Loved Story,7,12 April 2014,"Oz The Great and Powerful tells the charming tale of the famous Wizard of Oz, Oscar (James Franco), a struggling magician from Kansas who finds himself whisked away to the magical land of Oz and expected to save it from the Wicked Witch. Meeting many magical creatures and a few witches along the way, Oscar must prove himself a worthy magician and defeat evil.With the famous foundation film, The Wizard of Oz (1939) being so popular even today, it's not surprising that another spin-off has been made, but it does not try to simply redress the old story. Instead, it keeps some of the old characters such as the Good Witch, and tells the story in a completely unseen way, introducing a host of new characters and a completely different angle to the much-loved tale, although the story remains fairly simplistic. The film itself is visually stunning, both in special effects and the colourful fairyland landscape of Oz – it reminds me of a more ""tripped out"" version of the latest Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005) film – which is made even more vibrant by the tasteful black and white of Kansas (a nice homage to The Wizard of Oz). The effects are put to use again in an almost-3D style with many things ""popping"" out of the screen, which I can imagine children would find thrilling, particularly in 3D.James Franco is charming as the great Wizard himself, only occasionally toppling over into some cheesy moments when he's trying to impress the ladies. The three witches Mila Kunis, Rachel Weisz, and Michelle Williams, all bring strong, feisty characters that give this film its punch; and of course it wouldn't be Oz without some magical characters such as Finley the flying monkey (voiced by Zack Braff) and the China girl (voiced by Joey King), who add a sweeter dimension to the film that kids will love. Visually impressive and offering a refreshing take on a much-loved story, Oz The Great and Powerful is a fun family film that all ages can enjoy.",Oz the Great and Powerful
218,sastorytellerfilms,"A superior fantasy film, there is no place like Oz",10,10 January 2015,"Sam Raimi nails it. Emotions, characters, storytelling and much more. Oz is reborn and earns its place with the original as a true film legend. Twenty years from now this movie will slowly start to shine its way as a timeless classic. I was so blown away with how magical the feel of this movie is. It is highly underrated probably because it follows more of a traditional formula than modern action and fantasy blockbusters. Oz has something really special that a lot of fantasy movies fall short on. It has Heart. The casting it absolutely perfect down to every single character. Raimi succeeds in getting you attached to all the characters very quickly with a Spielberg precision. I give this movie a well earned 10 stars for perfection. It's one of his best works in my opinion along with Spiderman and Darkman. Keep it up Sammie. Loved it.",Oz the Great and Powerful
219,bmcdannell,"Colorful, Entertaining, Enjoyable - with a few flaws",7,8 March 2013,"My wife and I went to see this on opening night and were not at all disappointed. Overall the story line held our interest, the effects were generally excellent and we felt it was worth seeing in the theater in 3D.While initially I was tempted to agree with so many of the reviews here that the characters of Oz and Theodora were poorly acted, after some reflection I think it was more that they were poorly written. A central character needs to have some redeeming qualities - some reason for the audience to like or sympathize with the character. Oz is supposed to be - to use some quaint sounding words - a rogue or a rascal, both of these words, I think, conveying a flawed character that still possesses an element of charm or whimsy. The writers missed the mark here and wound up (for at least the first three quarters of the movie) with a shallow, amoral, totally self-absorbed character essentially devoid of likability. In other words, they had a character that needed to be given depth but they failed to portray him in more than one dimension until it became absolutely necessary to afford him some redeeming qualities in order to make the story work. Conversely, in the case of Theodora they had a situation where the character came with built-in multiple, conflicting dimensions but they simply didn't quite know what to do with her.People who are making 3D movies need to sit down and actually watch some of them. The magic in 3D is almost always either in the overall scene or in the small, close-up effects. Scenes in this movie where small bits of debris slowly float out over the audience are quite magical. They missed an opportunity with the river faeries, who could have been quite breathtaking had they flitted forward in the frame to charm the audience. The more common tool used in this and other movies, however, is the frantic 'throw stuff at the audience' cliché - and it just. does. not. work. well. It distracts rather than impresses. I'm serious, movie makers. Watch some of this stuff - you'll see what I mean.For those of you concerned, the movie is unfortunately a bit intense in places for those under about 9 years old. There was a family sitting right behind us with a little girl about 7. During one of the flying Baboon scenes we heard a plaintive, ""I'm scared!"" from her - and I'm sure she was. And I'm sure she was equally frightened by several other scenes.Starting with a ten and taking one point off for some lackluster writing, one for too many uses of overwrought 'made ya flinch' 3D and one for some scenes a bit too frightening for some little ones, I wind up with a 7 - and a reassurance that despite the flaws, this is a very entertaining movie that we believe most people will truly enjoy.",Oz the Great and Powerful
220,zombiebird,Far too childish.,3,24 May 2013,"Well I suppose the general concept of this was good, although in no way original, but it was just badly carried out on every level.To begin with the script. Better writing could really have saved this movie, despite all of it's other flaws, but instead we get underdeveloped characters, easy to spot plot-holes and an odd pace of things, that is to say that a lot of the boring introductory stuff is slow paced, which really didn't need to be so, and a lot of the later scenes in Oz, which really could have used the extra time, are rushed and feel almost silly. Added to all of this the dialogs and jokes are just plain bland, I understand that this movie was made for kids but still, you don't have to make it seem like a cartoon. Then we have the ending, which is utterly inconclusive, Oz hasn't killed either of the witches (and on that note it's worthy to mention that nobody actually dies in this movie) but simply forced them to run away, and we are told that they will soon return. Oz neither marries the Queen nor returns to his homeland, it just ends after the final battle leaving us wondering what exactly happened. Characters like Oz always return back to the real world, Alice did it, the Narnia kids did it, Hell even Harry Potter did it, you can't just leave your characters hanging in a fantasy universe. Bad writing.Now for the CGI, almost 90% of the movie is green screen, and for some reason it's just awful. Pretty much all through out I could tell the differences between the actors and the background, they just didn't naturally blend into the background scene. It really felt like people standing in front of a painted cardboard cutout. A lot of the times the lighting and shadows felt a little off as well, especially in the field of sunflowers where the whole countryside was a bright brilliant yellow and the actors were walking in a much darker shade of light, it made everything feel so disconnected. Then we have the lightening that Rachel Weisz's character shoots out, it looks cheesy and ridiculous, I'm trying to think of something to compare it too but nothing comes to me, so in short, it's just stupid. Everything lacks realism, the castles the walls, the creates, they all look like they are made out of plastic, they just don't have any features to them. Speaking of features, the green evil look that Mila Kunis adopted after her character turned evil looked like a rubber mask, they could have at least done some proper prosthetics. As far as acting goes, it was bad all around, James Franco seemed completely un-invested in his character and really just smiled and said his lines, quite possibly his worst performance yet. The ""witches"" were slightly better in that they tried to play out their parts, but still their performances were weak and had that ""staged"" element to them. My guess is that since all of this was green screen, none of the actors could really get a feel for their characters or the settings. Zach Braff was the only good 1 here, his 5 minutes of screen time in the beginning is sadly the best piece of acting you'll see in this film.To sum up, the movie is entertaining if you're in the mood for a childish fantasy, but overall I doubt anybody over the age of 8 will actually love this film.",Oz the Great and Powerful
221,Aldri7,not so deserving prequel,5,10 March 2013,"The story of how the Wizard of Oz came to be the Wizard of Oz is one I suppose might captivate a lot of people. But you might end up leaving the theatre a bit disappointed to find out exactly how it happened. Oz it seemed at the time was dominated by a trio of powerful sisters, all young and lusting for a man. Strangely, no suitable guy could be found on the premises though, and so they must wait for the gods to deliver a unsuspecting con-man from Kansas who arrives via a tornado and is named ""OZwald"". Oswald is soon courted by the sisters, all of whom are witches but only ""good"" vs ""bad"" in the context of their relationships with men and the outcome of their petty sibling rivalry. Predictably (and to many peoples discomfort), the least beautiful witch is the most evil while the good witch (Glinda) is the most beautiful. MIla Kunis on the other hand, the third witch, is at first less tainted by evil, but then transforms into the wicked witch of the west when sister Glinda snatches Oswald away from her. Got it all? And so an entire war is unleashed because of this petty rivalry among three powerful women. No other guys figure into this. Its as though Oz itself is devoid of any other men of any stature - every other guy is just a simpleton, soldier or dwarf. Huh? anyway, so the ""wizard to be"" has to figure out how to stay alive thanks to his unfortunate preference for blond, beautiful witches over dark haired, less kindly witches. If he can do that, then Oz is his for the taking..Anyway, so thats the story. Oz was always about the war between the witches, but at least in the original ""Wizard of Oz"" there is Dorothy's own story or quest which had some heroic qualities. But here, the Wiz is just a hapless guy who gets thrown into a mess he has no control over. His lack of heroic qualities actually is what got him into this. And so he must figure out how to adapt and con his way into becoming the heroic leader the witches all want him to be. So what kind of trouble was OZ in anyway, that they had this need for a wizard? I don't really know.But what I really liked about the original Wizard of OZ"" was that the wizard turned out to be this familiar guy from Kansas while all around him were these people that were like aliens to Dorothy. And so only the Wizard was able to get her grounded, her head turned around right and headed back to Kansas where she belonged. But here, the Kansas vs OZ thing is lost. The wiz never looks back, returns to his roots nor wishes he had an Auntie Em he could talk to. Strangely, his girlfriend from Kansas is also the good witch. So maybe he doesn't need to look back. But the jist is that everything he does in this film is out of necessity as a way to save his skin. He has no control over his fate otherwise. Generally in these situations, people do more than just grin and wise crack their way through it all. I suppose being fought over by three women isn't all that bad, but on the other hand, I kept hoping the wiz would show a little broader range of emotions. The effect is that the movie is all glossed over fantasy with nothing deeper to chew on. I mean, I hate to wax sentimental, but when Dorothy went ""there's no place like home"" a lot of people could actually relate to that at the time...So, yeah, Mila Kunis is a central figure here and I know she was the jealous girlfriend in ""That 70's show"". And so I kept flashing back to her in that role and seeing this jealous, vindictive high school feuding over boyfriends thing going on in ""OZ"" which was the main theme to me. But I don't think that as a prequel to a classic Hollywood movie, this was up to snuff. It was an alien to the original. Very little attempt was made to rekindle the character of the original wizard, who was all homespun and Kansas bred. The rural vs urban theme in the original was central to the plot. The original wiz was a con man but with a heart born of humble roots. The wiz here on the otherhand is just a con man, a city slicker perhaps who wound up in Kansas doing magic acts because I guess he felt he could make a buck.Anyway, but there were some things i enjoyed here so it wasn't all disappointing to me. This is not a movie i would tell people to stay away from. It had cute moments and nice visuals, and the homages to Thomas Edison, etc and the technology of the times (1905) were nice. But its funny how this story sort of reverses the original in that Dorothy was young and innocent while her traveling comrades were older. Here, its the companions that are or seem childlike. But the sidekicks were pure Disney fantasy as was the humor and that also left me a little nostalgic for the original. You've got over 70 years of filmmaking in between these two movies, and too much in Hollywood has changed for them to bear much resemblance to one another.",Oz the Great and Powerful
222,OperaTarte,Something is Missing,5,18 March 2013,"There is something sadly missing from this film, cohesion comes to mind. The attempt is laudable, but the results are unfinished. James Franco is so completely wrong for the role and detracts from a film that needs unity of talent. Mila Kunis, Rachel Weisz and Michelle Williams are for some reason not believable. With Rachel Weisz especially it's talent wasted. The costumes are lacking imagination and are under developed in quality and originality, even with the license that the franchise allows. The CGI is good, but the imagination of how to use it and on what is missing as well. I didn't care for the China Doll character, for some reason it wasn't endearing but gave me the opposite feeling. ""Oz"" tries too hard without having first realized that rare sensibility called the 'soul' of a film. There's little to feel about it, except that there is nothing 'great' about it at all.",Oz the Great and Powerful
223,tvmovienews,Oz the Great and Powerful,6,5 August 2013,"I'm not usually a huge fan of fantasy films as I find a lot of them focus too heavily on visuals and lack in storyline, so I wasn't overly excited to watch Oz the Great and Powerful. This film is directed by the brilliant Sam Raimi, who's work includes the original Spider-man and Evil Dead series. It is also based on L. Frank Baum's Oz novels, and is set 20 years before the events of the classic film 'The Wizard of Oz'. In this film it follows Oscar Diggs (played by James Franco), a small time magician, who is sucked into a tornado and crash lands in Oz. There he meets a witch called Theodora who believes he is the wizard prophesied to overthrow the Wicked Witch and save the people of Oz.While I still don't think this was an amazing film, it was still much better than I expected. The storyline gave plenty of references to the original film, but still had its own originality. For such a long film I didn't feel that it dragged too much and moved at a pretty steady pace. The acting by all was very solid, in particular Mila Kunis who was great as one of the witches. As expected the special effects were pretty impressive, and I'm sure would've looked great in 3D.I hope I haven't hyped this up too much, but if you go into it with the right attitude hopefully you enjoy it too.My rating: 6.5/10 For more Movie and TV News, Reviews and Rumours go to: www.facebook.com/tvmovienews",Oz the Great and Powerful

225,rahmannoodles22,Oz: The Mediocre & Somewhat Powerful - Noodles Review,5,19 December 2013,"Oz: The Great & Powerful is the alleged prequel to '30s classic The Wizard of Oz. Though, Warner Bros. owns the rights to the latter, with Disney being responsible for the former. Essentially, Oscar, or Oz as he is known by, is a conman magician in a traveling circus. The movie begins in black and white 4:3 format while Oz is in Kansas, until a tornado comes around (wow, Kansas must have a lot of tornadoes that take you to other worlds) and he lands in the Land of Oz (weird; his name is Oz and the world is called Oz). Now, Oz, the man, is tasked with becoming the savior of Oz, the land. Though, he's not exactly up to the task as he's only a small-time magician, in contrast to telling everyone he's a powerful wizard.As far the acting goes, James Franco never lets us down and his reputation remains that way with his performance as Oz. It's interesting to see his evolution as a person, growing from a selfish conman to a brave intellectual. Then there's the three witches. The only witch that I, personally, appreciated was that of Gelinda the Good, who was played as an overly kind yet sly woman, which is how she should be. The other two witches are either overacted or laughable. Additionally (spoiler alert but you should have already expected this), the Wicked Witch of the West is a huge let down in this movie. 'Nough said about her. My favourite character in the movie is Finley, the flying monkey who is a companion to Oz.Oz: The Great & Powerful is a CGI fest. Everything in the movie is extremely spontaneous, but that takes a little bit away from the joy of coming back to Oz. On the contrary, it makes from the stunning visuals. The movie is very colourful and full of fascinating things to look at. But special effects aren't what make a movie stellar. The writing and direction of this movie are somewhat disappointing. It's obvious to see where the director is trying to go with this movie, attempting to make it feel as nostalgic to the original as possible, but it just doesn't work. Additionally, the plot is extremely predictable and quite forgettable.Well, let's wrap this up. The goods of Oz: The Great & Powerful are the acting of the title character, the sometimes funny scenes (especially that flying monkey), and the majestic visuals. Unfortunately, the downs of this movie are just as much: the directing is poor, two out of the three witches aren't acted or written well, and the movie is very forgettable. Oz: The Great & Powerful is definitely entertaining for at times, but it feels stretched at others. While it's a good movie to watch with the family, it's definitely forgettable. 5.5 out of 10 Noodles: I probably won't remember this by next month.",Oz the Great and Powerful
226,theredraylives,"Wonderful and thought-provoking, but a mess",6,18 March 2013,"Oz the Great and Powerful is a pseudo-prequel to the indomitable Wizard of Oz, so it's hard to see the film doing anything to satisfy the expectations of film-goers everywhere. In terms of direction, effects, and (most of) the script, the film is utterly spectacular; it is marred by flat-out bad performances from most of its major cast, and the supporting cast isn't enough to prop it up, no matter how cute that little china doll (Joey King) is. It seems, unfortunately, to forget the whimsy and wonder that made the 1939 film so endearing to audiences- most of the actors herein seem rather bored, and their characters are all profoundly thin. Oz is a great movie to look at, but director Sam Raimi seems to have taken a page out of the George Lucas playbook, paying more attention to visual effects and set pieces than the performances on which any good film must, ultimately, rest.The film stars James Franco as a small-time con man and magician in a traveling circus who is whisked away to the magical land of Oz when he runs afoul of the neighborhood strongman. He first meets the young witch Theodora (Mila Kunis), who instantly falls in love with him as they journey to the Emerald City, which has fallen under hard times. The king was murdered, and the ""wizard"" is prophesied to become the new king, if only he can slay the Wicked Witch. So, the journey begins, and... Franco is really annoying most of the time he's on-screen. Yes, yes, he's supposed to be somewhat aloof and conniving, but his character is so reprehensible and regards so much of what he sees with disdain that to actively root for him as a protagonist just feels wrong. Franco is overacting, to a fantastic degree, and the film suffers for it. Even as the film goes on and he gradually transforms into the ""hero"" that the film wants him to be, his pandering performance only saps away from the wondrous world that Raimi and company have created.Despite the film directly positioning itself as a prequel to the Wizard of Oz, the interesting question is... is it a dream? Raimi utilizes the same trick here, with actors appearing in the opening 4:3 shot in sepia tones and playing primary characters in Oz. They each represent a facet of Oz's life or personality that he is unable to rectify in real life: He is unable to help a little girl at his show to walk, but in Oz, he fixes her legs. He badly mistreats his assistant Frank (Zach Braff), only to come to respect his counterpart in Oz. In Theodora, one sees the manifestation of his carelessness, greed, and womanizing, turning her into the evil Wicked Witch of the West. And, of course, the grandest of all- he is a failure as a magician in his real life, but is able to become a great success in Oz. Isn't it all a little too... neat? Regardless, this aspect of the film is by far its most fascinating. One wonders if there was a sequence scripted to have the magician wake up back in the sepia-toned real world at the end- the aforementioned legal troubles might have played into this, but as it is the film is meant to precede Baum's original works, in which Oz was unequivocally real. For the most part, the rest of the cast simply phones it in. Michelle Williams is relatively bland as Glinda the Good Witch, adding no subtext or offering no complexities to the character and instead content to pawn her off as a symbol of absolute purity. Returning to the above, this may have been intentional- Oz sees Annie, her counterpart in Kansas, as a symbol of love, elegance, and purity, and it is no surprise then to see her as a manifestation of such in Oz. Still, Williams does nothing with the role. Not sure who to blame exactly for Mila Kunis' over-the-top performance as Theodora: her or the script. It largely relegates her turn as the Wicked Witch of the West into petty jealousy and a revenge stunt against a womanizing idiot, and both she and the role deserve better than this. She plays Theodora as wickedly naive, and plays the Wicked Witch as so flamboyantly evil she may has well have carried around a giant banner that said, 'I'm really evil!' The only one who really gives a great performance here is Rachel Weisz as Evanora, who is so deliciously and subtly evil and was an enormous pleasure to watch. Outside of the main cast, the only standouts are Braff as the flying monkey Finley and King as the little china doll, the latter being so heartwarming that the film could've been about her for a solid two hours and it would've been fantastic. The others are forgettable and/or comic relief, particularly the running gag of Oz never being able to remember Knuck's (Tony Cox) real name.Overall, Oz the Great and Powerful is gorgeous to look at and the 3D is well-done and not over-the-top. It is used well to great effect, much to Raimi's credit. This cast was simply wrong for this film, and Franco's performance is not nearly strong enough to carry it. Go for the stunning visuals and great effects, and the (mostly) great writing. The script hands down a great character arc for Oz, and with an actor who maybe wanted to play the role, the film probably would've been a lot more enjoyable to watch. In the ""literature as film"" sense- if the characters in Oz are little more than metaphors for various facets of the wizard's own life and personality- it is a fantastic and marvelous success. The performances only needed to deliver this, but they fell resoundingly flat.",Oz the Great and Powerful

I have never understood the adulation James Franco gets, and this film reinforced that view. Bad dialog delivered by someone over-acting to the Nth degree makes for some pretty painful viewing.

Come to think of it, it's a lot like an animated movie, with a moral to the story.

It's neither excellent nor forgettable.It's fair to say the acting isn't the biggest strength of the film: Mila Kunis doesn't do anything apart from being pretty, Rachel Weisz is intolerable and James Franco gives a solid performance that nonetheless doesn't quite seem to fit the character. The better part of the supporting cast is animated. With 2 hours and 10 minutes it has some lengths, and some sequences could have been cut.Apart from these the film will keep you engaged with a beautiful and well-crafted fantasy world, reminiscent of Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland.

I thought I was in to see little film achievement, but this film blew me away. Along with the plot, the acting was amazing. But the glue that held this movie tighter than all was the creative imagination and setting. I felt like I was in the world that Oz (James Franco), Theodora (Mila Kunis), Evanora (Rachel Weiz), and Glenda (Michelle Williams) was in. There was one problem. James Franco, an amazing actor, did not fit the movie right. It was not meant for him. I thought his acting was good, just his appearance made the movie somewhat weirder. Many say that the beautiful Mila Kunis was a mis-cast, and I love all her work. The reason why people did not like her is because she tends to play in more inappropriate movies, and do an outstanding job. She doesn't have as much pizzaz in this film, but she did good to me. But other than that, it was unbelievable. The plot was not boring, it was suspenseful. Some scenes pop out at you, and you might even jump off your seat! My eyes widened, and every new scene made you want to know what was going to happen. My favorite parts (not giving any spoiler alerts) was the tornado scene as seen in the trailer, and when Oz enters the world. Watching this movie did not waist the expensive tickets and snacks you pay for, it was worth more than anything you bought at the theater. The Beginning:On-Going and Great; The Middle: Creative and Amazing; The Ending: Suspenseful, Eye Popping, Jaw Dropping moments that are unbelievable.

This movie had heart, a good storyline, a well-written script, emotion and some intense moments. It's not as much a prequel to the 1939 classic ""The Wizard of Oz"" as much as it is a reboot of the ""Oz"" franchise that acts as a prequel to the novel ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"" by L. Frank Baum (not that I've read the novel). As a reboot, I think it did the source material justice. As a prequel, it actually answered some of my questions. I think the reason some people were disappointed by ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" is because they had high expectations for it. I actually had very low expectations going into it and I was surprised by it. I thought it was going to be ""Alice in Wonderland"" but set in Oz and without the only reason to watch it (Johnny Depp). From the trailers and TV spots, it looked like it was made to cash-in with ""Alice in Wonderland"". It was so poorly marketed. But I thought the movie was one thousand times better than ""Alice"". I've seen ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" three times now and I don't see why some people may hate it. Sure it's almost all CG (but then so were ""300"" and ""Avatar"" and no one gave a crap) and the cast consists almost entirely of celebrities (but then again, Judy Garland was a celebrity) so I can sort of understand why it may feel like a turn-off. However, I can't name a bad thing about the movie and most of my friends who have seen it really enjoyed it like I did. While James Franco wasn't the best choice for the Oz character, I think he pulled it off very well. I think it's a much better prequel movie than ""Star Wars: The Phantom Menace"" was. And I like ""Star Wars"" better than ""Wizard of Oz"" so I think that's saying something. ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" may not be a masterpiece or better than the classic but It's a ""great and powerful"" movie and if you haven't seen it, I highly recommend it. Don't listen to the haters. You're opinion is all that matters. I give this movie 10 stars out of 10.",Oz the Great and Powerful

When one of the circus artists finds out that he gave a music box to his wife – one of his tricks to get into a woman's ""heart"" – he chases him through the entire area. Oz jumps into a balloon and cuts the robe lose only to get sucked into a bad twister. Scared for his life he gets swept away and wakes up in an enchanted, colorful world like he has never seen before. He meets Theodora (Mila Kunis), a witch that explains that he is in Oz. When he tells her that his name is Oz as well, she assumes that he is the wizard everyone is looking for to free the people of Oz from the wicked witch. After he hears that whoever kills the witch has a lot of gold waiting for him he confirms that he is the one everyone is waiting for. He makes Theodora fall in love with him by giving her another music box claiming that it was a gift from his grandmother. Theodora's sister Evanora (Rachel Weisz) seems sceptical and questions Oz's true intentions. On his way to find and kill the wicked witch he makes friends with a monkey and a porcelain doll. But when he faces Glinda (Michelle Williams), the witch who everyone claims to be wicked he notices that she looks exactly like one of his former romances. Is Glinda the wicked witch? Is someone playing a game with him? How will Theodora react when she figures out that he might have feelings for Glinda? And how is a fake magician going to fight against a powerful witch?Review: Oz the Great and Powerful is a very cute tale of how the wizard of Oz actually came to life. Many critics think that having a male lead character for an Oz-tale is a major step back for witches and women, but I strongly disagree. Yes, the major focus should be – as the title hints – on the wizard, but fact is there are three powerful women who the movie couldn't live without. The witches left a much bigger impression in my opinion than the wizard. But what is this movie really about? Is it about who is more important in out society, men or women? No, obviously certain critics are too busy being bitter and resentful. The movie shows that you need to believe in yourself first in order to help others. You need to love yourself first before you love others. And most importantly never give up. So I give a big fat DUH to all of you who are trying to outrage the women in this world for being neglected in this movie, because you are very wrong. But that's just how I feel. The movie delivers probably the most stunning cinematography I have seen this year and the transition from the black and white treatment into color is almost breath taking. I fell in love with the images and creatures of Oz. All the actors give a nice performance with what they are given, and here is where I have to take points off: What the actors were given is a thin storyline. The dialogues were not bad, flat or frustrating in any way but I missed the magic. I remember I watched Return to Oz many many years ago and was totally intrigued by it but I didn't get that from this movie, especially at the beginning which seemed very long. However, I have to admit that the amazing graphics almost made me forgot about my disappointment. Plus the monkey was hilarious!Oz the Great and Powerful is an enchanting and colorful family movie with a few flaws here and there, but still very enjoyable.

235,blackbanter,"Beautifully created, but with a Disney storyline.",7,27 October 2019,"""Oz: The Great and Powerful"" is the prequel to 1939's ""The Wizard of Oz"" that I was frankly not at all surprised by.The story is about a circus magician named Oz (James Franco) who, through the fantastic opening segment, we as the audience are told is a con-man earning a living fooling people. From that we follow the typical Disney storyline that, while it is oh so predictable, it is also extremely enjoyable (at least to me).The cast did a decent job, although I have to say James Franco knocked it out of the park, delivering a breathtaking performace that really made me care for his character.For the most part this movie looks astonishing, utilizing a lot of CGI to create this mystical and magical world, and, though it is noticeable at points, I was never really unimmersed from what was going on.Sam Raimi directed this movie and it shows, I really enjoyed it's look, albeit some strange cuts here and there.What really let's this movie down is it's script, being clearly aimed at children. This doesn't mean an adult won't enjoy it because there's definitely enjoyment to be had but it does mean there will be some eye rolls from time to time.Overall ""Oz: The Great and Powerful"" is a fun experience that I look forward to seeing again and, if you have kids, definitely watch this one with them. Trust me, you'll enjoy it!B-",Oz the Great and Powerful
236,lvilaguillen,It could be pretty better but I really enjoyed it,7,9 March 2013,"I have to state that I've read a lot of reviews for this movie in Metacritic and this place as well, that was not promising really. Also when I found the director was Sam Raimi (Spider Man) I felt really disappointed as well. Even though I decided to give it a chance, because I liked the cast (I know James Franco is not the best actor, but he did so good in 127 hours...)... Well, I really enjoyed this one, I know he doesn't reach the charm of the original 1939 classic, but it was a good prequel. James did a decent work... sometimes he was lack of the emotion required and sometimes I found him maybe over the top... but not so much and I enjoyed him anyway. He didn't distract me from the plot with his performance. The art in this movie, the mate painting, the CG (specially in the little porcelain doll) was incredible amazing. The world of Oz was so fantastic. Clever idea to work in the first part of the movie in full screen and B&W... then turn it to wide screen and color. Of course the idea comes from the original, it was a good move. The music, loved it. Love Danny Elfman, I was kinda disappointed anyway at this point. I feel wherever I hear Elfman's soundtrack I know is good, I feel it, but he doesn't reach the top, what makes a soundtrack memorable. The music for the music box... was incredible. Reminded me to a timeless circus, a fair like it was, an epic tale and fantastic story all together. If Elfman just worked all around that single theme... It have been a perfect PERFECT soundtrack. The rest of the cast... I enjoyed Mila Kunis when she was like a little girl in love at the first part of the movie, he looked like he never been with a men before, and felt enchanted with all that Oz did with her... maybe she needed more emotion when her heart was broken... it was believable, but if she have taken it far... would be perfect. Rachel did OK, can't complain but not so memorable. I loved Michelle Williams as Glinda, so charming and always believing and giving that ray of hope, that makes her the Good Witch. SO... resuming... it could be a lot lot lot better movie, but for what we've got is a fair decent prequel, with good moments, clever ideas, and outstanding art and music.",Oz the Great and Powerful
237,sonicfan5715,"Not as ""Great and Powerful"" as ""Oz"" could have been.",7,9 March 2013,"I went into this movie not really knowing what to expect, except that the story centered around how ""Oz"" came to be the actual ""wizard of oz."" Nevertheless it seemed interesting enough to see on opening night in 3D (which the 3D for this movie was pretty good, though I was expecting more flying ""baboons"" to fly out and scare me in 3D). The end result... it was good, it was a good movie, nothing ""great and powerful"", but it was still pretty good.Storywise, it was pretty intriguing, how Oz (James Franco) was a magician in a traveling circus in Kansas, and wanting to be a ""great man"" above all good men, and through being chased by a big muscle man and escaping on a hot air balloon, Oz is whisked away by a tornado and sent to Oz. (Btw, the beginning paper cut-out/puppet show credits is absolutely beautiful, as well as everything being in black/white until he reaches the colorful and vibrant world of Oz.) I don't want to give too much away as to the plot, but Oz eventually is led to the Emerald City alongside Theodora (Mila Kunis, stunningly beautiful as always) and a flying monkey Finely (Zack Braff, whose voice-over performance here is pretty enjoyable). There he meets the witch Evanora (Rachel Weiz, whose performance is one of the films highlights), and is sent on a quest to kill the wicked witch and claim his throne.After that the story does take some interesting (there goes that word again) turns as too the characters development, who they meet, and who is actually good and bad. Though personally my biggest complaint is Mila Kunis's performance as Evanora (to be the green Wicked Witch of the West in time). She does well as Evanora, and I really did not expect her to actually become the WW of the West, that's a lot to take on compared to the scary as hell witch in the original. Before she was the witch, her performance was pretty good, and the fact that whenever she cried it left burning scars on her face was pretty creative. But when she becomes the Witch we all knew and loved... she wasn't exactly creepy or scary. In fact, she wasn't particularly frightening to look at, she was still attractive with a crooked nose and green skin! She did have good moments when she went kind of crazy as the witch, but overall with her design and underwhelming performance as the witch, it just didn't really work. On the upside though, the glass china girl (Joey King), is a really, really well handled special effect, my personal favorite in the film.But Mila Kunis not being the best choice for the witch isn't exactly why the film is not as good as I think it could have been, its just the fact that this was a prequel to one of the most beloved films of all time, and what we got just wasn't what I was hoping for, just something incredibly out there and fantastic. But for what we got... I still enjoyed it quite a bit. CGI plays almost 100% of a role in the film, and it's used pretty well, it does have some great moments with the side characters, the witches, and Oz himself with his out of place character eventually using his skills as a magician/trickster/prankster to defeat the evil that threatened the people of Oz.Originally I was going to give this a 6, but thinking about it more a lot went into this, and the fact that Disney came up with something that was pretty well made is great. So, I think it deserves a 7/10: a good, entertaining flick about the coming of Oz with pretty well done CGI and ""interesting"" storyline, just some casting issues and being compared to the original really hold it down from being, again, ""great and powerful.7/10, sonicfan5715 (Jeffrey V)",Oz the Great and Powerful
238,DangerAwesome,Two hours waiting for the ending,4,11 October 2013,"""Oz the Great and Powerful"" attempts to overcome a wide array of problems, and succeeds only a fraction of the time. Horrible dialogue, mediocre casting, and little to no character development plague this poor effort of a film.Though for its poor effort, it does succeed in its reimagination of the land of Oz. The setting is the only area of this production I would call strong, and I think the case might easily be made that the setting is the most important part of the movie.The special effects are at times overused. Much of it using its 3D effects for no purpose other than to have a 3D effect. For example, in one scene the witch sees the China Girl with Glenda's wand out of the corner of her eye. The girl quickly hinds behind a tree, and the witch goes to inspect. She hovers there for a couple seconds, leans in (to give us the 3D effect), doesn't find the girl, and flies away. End scene. There was no purpose at all to those 10 seconds. It was a complete waste of time. Many of the other special effects play like a roller coaster ride at Disneyland. We watch Oz in his air balloon cruise down a raging river and fall off a waterfall. All the while Oz screaming. Again, no real purpose to that scene at all.The dialogue leaves much to be desired. The concept of 'something better left unsaid' doesn't exist in this movie. They frequently have a character say the exact thing we were already thinking. They don't give the audience enough credit. It felt like I was being talked down to.I can forgive all of those issues though. They are certainly not unique to this movie. The biggest problem of all is that you can see the ending coming before watching the movie. If you've ever watched the 1939 classic, or even watched the first 5 minutes of this movie, then you know that Oz will trick the witches into running away using no magic. Basically leaving the audience to sit for 2 hours waiting to see the ending.Perhaps the issue isn't so much that you can see it coming, it's that the rest of the movie isn't worth it. There are no twists, no turns, no character development. Once the fun of the setting wears off, it's just sitting there waiting to see Oz trick the witches. Nothing more.",Oz the Great and Powerful

240,Loothor,The Great and Powerful Flaws,6,11 March 2013,"So what's so Great and Powerful about Oz? Unfortunately, not a whole lot. There's just enough things that are good about Oz to make it worth a rental or even a trip to the theater if you just love to see decent CGI on a huge screen, and plenty of things that are okay enough about Oz to nullify complaints about the competency of those who made the movie. This is obviously a film with a large budget made by people who know a lot about making movies. Technical competency abounds.But greatness and power are both missing in what is an essentially soulless movie. The predictability is off the charts, and the entire script feels like a conglomeration of standard characters and standard lines from a giant compendium of stock screenplay bits for screenwriters on a deadline.There are too many nods to the overpowering canon of this movie's heritage, too many times it prods you in the ribs, winks at you, and slyly says, ""Heh... remember that? Remember how great it was when (_insert any of 50 great 'Wizard of Oz' moments here_)? Isn't it clever how I fit right in with that?"" The problem is that all of this elbowing and winking leaves little room for the movie to stand on it's own and constantly draws the viewer out of what should be an immersive movie experience to think about a different movie. It also just feels forced and awkward, like when a comedian laughs at their own jokes.Overall, no amount of technical expertise and fantastical special effects can make up for a movie that feels like it was made by a marketing department. There is little organic joy in this script, every moment feels like it came out of the Disney Handbook for Successfully Generating Marketable Characters.The cast is okay, with particularly decent performances by Rachel Weisz and Michelle Williams, who manage to breathe some life into rather flat characters. The male leads are a different story, with James Franco falling into the same ""elbow and wink"" feeling the script has. He's play-acting, not acting. Zach Braff, unfortunately, is just so ""Zach Braff"" that you can almost see his face instead of Finley's, which basically destroys the entire character and pulls you out of the movie every time he opens his mouth.All in all, this feels like a children's movie because children don't have the depth of experience to be hit by just how cliché everything is. But a ""Great and Powerful"" movie feels like it is deep enough for adults without losing children and original enough to be new to everyone, no matter how many times they've sat in a theater.This Oz is good enough to entertain those with a low bar, but it certainly isn't Great or Powerful.",Oz the Great and Powerful

Possibly the worst movie ever made.",1,19 September 2013,"On a recent flight I attempted to watch this dreadful CGI garbage but after twenty nauseating minutes, that I'll never get back, I turned it off and read a book instead. I went into this movie with optimistic expectations because there were a number of actors, chief among them was Rachel Weisz, however I was extremely disappointed with the amount of CGI. Furthermore I had no real expectation of James Franco but found his performance to be just terrible.If Hollywood continues to rely on CGI while neglecting quality scripts and acting, I believe they will continue to see lackluster returns at the box office. CGI should be a tool to enhance the story not be the only reason to see the movie. The Matrix and Avatar were pioneers in this new technology but it was used to make the movies better.

The visuals for the most part are incredible.It was a pleasant surprice that they did not go too close to the original so viewers would not be making comparisons scene by scene. The first half hour did feel very rushed and they could of benefited with developing the character of Theodora (Mila Kunis) A couple of the casting choices seemed miscast like Racheal Weisz who didn't seem to fit the role of Evanora. Mila Kunis defiantly steals the show with a fascinating personality who you seemed to really care about.

(BTW, I am continuing to heal and I appreciate everyone's kind messages.) What was unusual about this trip to the movies, aside from the oversize shoe to protect my foot owwie, was I had already read some reviews of this film while in the hospital and they were, quite frankly, very uncomplimentary. I was prepared to be disappointed, but I was not. This is the prequel to the famous 1939 film, and in it we get to know the Wizard of Oz as a younger man, two wicked witches, and Glinda, the good witch. James Franco is the Wizard, and quite frankly this was one of the first movies I have seen him in where he actually acts. Mila Kunis is the Wicked Witch of the West, Rachel Weisz is her sister who will one day get a house dropped on her, and Michelle Williams is Glinda. All were amazing.The plot here is very clever and leads us right up to the classic movie story. Attention was paid to detail so we know it was the Oz we love and it has a cute ending that lets us in on the secret of why the two witches were wicked and left a little annoyed with The Wizard and Glinda. Add in an adorable China Doll and a cute flying monkey and you have a good movie. My only complaint was it was mostly a computer generate land of Oz, and while it looked nice, I thought there were some scenes that dragged on just so we could be reminded of how much was spent on this film. Other than that I recommend this one and give it a good 3 out of Fordyce.Credit Check: Nothing happens after the credits. in Movies",Oz the Great and Powerful
245,lilantman10,Sam Raimi has done it again.,8,12 March 2013,"I'm going to come out and say it. This is one of the best family movies that has come out in a while. It strikes that perfect balance of adults and elementary school kids, and is another winner from Sam Raimi.Let me address the common complaints that everyone will have that they would've had no matter what movie they where shown. The callbacks to the original are all clever and don't stop the movie AT ALL. All the major characters are referenced in a subtle way that serves the story first. People are acting like this movie is a remake as opposed to a prequel. That means that it absolutely has to link up with The Wizard of Oz. Next the CGI. The problem with making anything with great special effects is people will complain they're hollow. This is more Avatar or Scott Pilgrim sort of effects that create a world instead of Sucker Punch or Underworld. It's only apparent they're using CGI because it's so beautiful it couldn't be a map painting. Next is the 3d. Wow, gorgeous 3d. It really puts you into Oz, and almost gives it a motion ride feel.Now to talk about Sam Raimi. This guy is the king of taking a movie, and making it super fun and then having moments that are genuinely scary. Even Evil Dead 2, and Drag Me To Hell have slapstick moments that are hilarious, and Spiderman 2 had a scene with Doc Ock that was filmed like a horror movie. He specializes in making fun, campy movies, and really bringing out your inner child and then scarring the hell out of it. The movie isn't without flaws. James Franco continues to be a guy who can totally sleepwalk through a movie depending on the project. He's very one-note in this movie and really Robert Downey Jr. would've knocked this role out the park and everyone would come out saying how great the movie was. Another problem with these green screen movies is that you can tell the actors aren't reacting to real things. Here it's pretty much seamless, except Franco's acting really doesn't sell it. Also another problem I have with ALL of Saimi's movies is the pacing isn't always the best, the movie doesn't slow down, it just has a consistent steady pace. It can be a tad bit predictable, but usually in a rewarding way, not in a roll your eyes way. All the pieces are given to figure out the narrative, and the smarter viewers will peg it, but others, like myself, will have fun catching up. But it is a kid's movie , and honestly I feel like if it was any less predictable they wouldn't be able to keep up.For my overall opinion this movie is fantastic. it's smart, it gets better with repeat viewings, I saw it twice in one day and caught some stuff I missed. I almost want a Wizard of Oz remake with this level of attention to detail, special effects, and action. There's no action director like Raimi, and some of the action scenes made me jump out of my seat, whilst having a big ol child like grin on my face. This is a must see in theaters for EVERYBODY in 3d, and if somebody else's opinion is based purely off comparing it to the original then let them be a sourpuss, and go enjoy this beautiful experience uninterrupted by unfair criticisms.",Oz the Great and Powerful

The Music and background score are decent as well. The characters and cinematography will totally immerse you in the fantasy land of Oz,and you will vicariously relish a land of magic,colour and vibrant characters.Give your mind a break,Sit back,relax and enjoy this adventurous treat.",Oz the Great and Powerful
247,jean0519,The Terrible Wizard of Oz,3,27 March 2013,"James Franco is miscast as the hustler/con-man/magician at the heart of the story. He's a small-time magician who plays traveling carnivals and mystifies the small-time folk with his tricks. There's a tornado (of course), and when it passes, he's dropped into the vibrant and beautiful land of Oz, complete with fairies, munchkins, flying monkeys (more like evil baboons with enormous fangs), Winkies, and witches.Sam Raimi is a great director, and the film is visually stunning, especially in 3D. The transition between black-and-white Kansas and Technicolor Oz is striking, and the screen actually widens to take in all the CGI glory. The animated porcelain doll was a masterpiece, and the traveling bubbles were beautiful. The visual effects earned my score of three stars and even the opening credits were terrific. The rest of the movie was really, really bad.Mila Kunis and Rachel Weisz are very beautiful witch-sisters, and they're both good actresses. Rachel Weisz was especially effective in her role. Mila Kunis was working against type, and I think it was a stretch of her acting muscles. Too bad, with stronger direction and less reliance on CGI, they could have made the movie so much more.James Franco played the Wizard-wannabe as a hapless stoner; there were times when it appeared that he was reading cue cards and this was the first time he had actually seen the script. He's a good actor, but it appears he didn't know whether he was playing for comedy, thrills, or horror. All of those emotions played on his face as if he were mugging for a silent movie.Which brings up another question: Who is the audience for this movie? It's far too intense for little ones, but teens and adults will be bored. For my part, Franco's ""phoning-it-in"" style of anchorless acting became so distracting it took me out of the movie and I left before the last 30 minutes. I walked out of this film, and I NEVER walk out of movies. It was that bad.""Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain."" Indeed.",Oz the Great and Powerful
248,mikerjones,From the Trailer expected a decent movie; the Movie did not disappoint.,8,15 June 2014,"Saw the trailer in theaters and on TV and was intrigued. However, for one reason or another did not get to see it when it was out. Now have seen it several times on cable, in HiDef on a large flat screen TV and with enhanced sound. Not exactly like the theater, but pretty good. Before seeing, I had seen some of the reviews here so I was probably more critical when watching it then I might have otherwise been. But my wife and my reaction after repeated viewings is, what was all the fuss about James Franco? He was exactly what the part called for. He was a smarmy con man who, as an unlikable small-time carnival magician, was out to get his due. Miscast? Puleeze, he was dead on. He presented the character as it was written and much closer to how it was written in the original books, and we thought he was fine in it.Remember, you're not supposed to like him for the first third to half of the picture. Over time, his character changes and adapts to his situation, but he certainly leaves some destruction in his wake. Not the least of which is the broken heart of the one who becomes the Wicked Witch of the West. ""She's worse than the other one"", as we're told in the MGM movie and now we know why! Scorned women and all that.Speaking of Mila Kunis, we thought she was quite good as Theodora, the younger of the two sister witches. The only thing that I would like her to have changed was that her anger sometimes devolved into shrieking that sounded a little too much like Jackie from 'That 70's Show'. But although she had anger management issues, you still feel for her as OZ strings her along. The older and most evil sister (at the start anyway) is Rachel Weisz as Evanora. Rachel was terrific and wonderful as all have said. She always is and anyone should be able to tell you that the third Mummy movie desperately needed her, even though it did have Michelle Yeoh.But speaking of a Michelle, it seems the one person so often overlooked in this OZ movie is Michelle Williams, who played Glinda. This Glinda was wonderful! I was transfixed at how far Michelle has come from her Dawson Creek Days. As someone who read all the OZ books in elementary school in the later '50's, I think she came the closest to the character as written on the page (except for lacking red hair). Michelle to me was every bit as perfect as Rachel. And Sam Rami's version of an OZ prequel comes the closet to any OZ book I have read. I fervently hope Disney has a sequel in mind with this cast. Just remember folks, if they ever do a version of Dorothy's story, it's Rachel who gets the house dumped on her head!",Oz the Great and Powerful
249,russedav,Everyone's a critic,10,8 June 2013,"I have to rise in opposition to a reviewer's misguided notion that dear James Franco ""lacks the dramatic stature necessary to make the character a more compelling one"" when his is certainly no less so than beloved Frank Morgan's. Everyone's a critic, but beauty's in the eye of the beholder and thankfully my eye is not so jaundiced. Whether or not the negative reviewer has some special alleged higher theatrical ""education"" or ""training"" to make such an arbitrary, self-important, value judgment gravamen of course has little to do with the grossly fickle nature of Hollywood where manifestly stellar performers are inexplicably panned or passed over, manifestly terrible ones inexplicably idolized. For some of us who are rather willing to give Franco the benefit of the doubt and risk embracing his presentation whereby to enter into it as the negative reviewer so sadly set in his hostile mindset sadly was unable to do, the experience is rather a joyful one of encountering an enjoyably genuine (wittingly or no) craftsman, one sadly missed by the negative reviewer, regardless of being heretofore unknown as he was to me. There's sadly a special stupidity reserved and only possible for the self-important, highly educated that show why the first will be (and even now often are) last. I've seen but a few of Franco's artistic endeavors and look forward to many more.",Oz the Great and Powerful
250,james-t-sheridan,"Nothing Ventured, Nothing Gained",5,13 March 2013,"""Oz The Great and Powerful"" exists as a calibrated commercial attempt to feed off of the reputation of the 1939 classic American film ""The Wizard of Oz."" ""Oz"" is clearly not a filmmaker's personal vision with the stamp of someone in love with the source material. And, that does not need to be an entirely bad thing if the film is interesting and has a compelling story told in a fresh way. Sam Raimi's take on the Oz universe starts out promising, but fails to come together, substituting CGI for story and offering strange lead performances which build towards a conventional climax with no room for nuance.James Franco plays Oz, a bit of a rake and a charlatan, a traveling magician in Kansas who loves them and leaves them before climbing into a marvelous hot air balloon that gets sucked into the center of a tornado. On the other side, Oz crash-lands and finds himself embroiled in a fight between the denizens of Oz and the machinations of three witches: Mila Kunis, Rachel Weisz, and Michelle Williams. Kunis is Theodora who finds Oz and falls for him, Weisz is Evanora, and Williams is Glinda. He has several traveling companions that include a talking flying monkey in a bellhop costume named Finley (Zach Braff) and the very breakable China Girl (Joey King). The film chronicles their journey to the Emerald City and confrontations with the three witches; the fate of the merry old land of Oz hangs in the balance.Raimi mirrors the original film by filming in black and white only until the Wizard travels to Oz, and there are some pretty moments of twisted trees and curling mountains, hints of Tim Burton. Several actors reappear in Oz after being introduced in Kansas, some through voice work. One of the major special effects at the end really works well, re-introducing a key moment from the original film, making a comment on the power of movie-making itself. However, the film fails on multiple levels despite its fine pedigree.A major criticism that I have is that Franco's Wizard has a major epiphany which Raimi has to play as a surprise, not as a development of character because the behavior is not grounded in any sort of evidence from the character himself. He changes, but we never see what prompts that change, robbing the scene of its power. As for the witches, Raimi struggles to balance all three of them, giving them rather dull personalities with little shading. Glinda, for example, played by one of the great actresses of our time, Michelle Williams, comes off as wooden and obtuse. Weisz should have stolen multiple scenes, and the capable, Academy Award-winning actress has little to do with an underwritten character with few juicy lines. Compared to Charlize Theron's delicious work in ""Snow White and The Huntsman,"" Weisz simply does not stand out or inspire fear. Kunis's character should be the most tragic of all but comes across merely as the most immature. There is a potentially strong concept here--that the Wizard falls in love (or simply, lust) with all three witches and his attempts to pursue them have unintended, disastrous consequences--but Raimi is making a PG film here, so any logic that goes beyond ""She's mad because he left her once"" is not included. The Munchkins are also given very little to do. Jokes fall flat, are repeated, still fall flat. At times, Franco seems to be overacting, over-emoting with his face and gestures, yet that makes sense given his character's showy, performative nature. For much of the film, Franco struggles to find his eye-line with CGI monkey Finley or China Girl, reminding me of Liam Neeson struggling to talk to Jar-Jar Binks in ""Star Wars: Episode One-The Phantom Menace."" In both films, the attempt to show something immense ruins the fun of seeing something small done well, and the weight of what we already know as an audience is insurmountable. There, Lucas was doling out hints and echoes purposefully; here, Raimi is constrained by what he is allowed to show and what he is forbidden to reference (Where are the ruby slippers?).The Land of Oz is a powerful place rendered in a way that still haunts me from the 1939 film: ugly trees that throw their apples, poppy fields that cast a spell, imposing castles with chanting guards, and the throne room with its eerie smoke. The image of Dorothy skipping down the road with Toto and companions is as iconic as any in American cinema. It seems a shame to make a film involving Oz that shies away from making any memorable music and cares little about making one memorable scene or sequence beyond Glinda's fog (pretty cool!) and flying monkeys (even more scary than the original). ""Oz The Great and Powerful"" is potentially exciting and probably great fun for young people, though the universe of the musical ""Wicked"" makes a better impression. The fault lies not in Franco or the witches or the voice work. Rather, I think Raimi's commercial instincts to deliver a PG film simplified the story, reduced complex characters to simple emotions, and hesitated in doing anything truly weird or amazing. One can only wonder what a visionary unafraid of weirdness or darkness like Guillermo del Toro can have done with Oz.Nothing ventured, nothing gained.",Oz the Great and Powerful
251,dwtaxi,"Good, but not great.",7,7 March 2013,"There is a lot of wasted potential in this film, which just falls short of being what it could have been. The film is visually stunning to be sure, but in this age of CGI madness, the effects are underwhelming, and the green skin of the evil witch looks like that of HULK 2003 and at one point in the dark forest they appear to be attacked by a Muppet show sketch, its just terrible. The transition from black and white also lacks the impact of the original film, especially as it comes about a minute after it should logically happen.The film also suffers from three major elements and a few lesser ones.1. Its not a musical. The closest they come to a musical number is a munchkin song which sounds begins really well but it cut short because Oz isn't interested in song and dance; except as a way to woo every woman he meets anyway.2. An irritating; whiny; Billy Crystal inspired flying monkey sidekick who really drags down the story. I assume it was supposed to be comic relief for children, but Billy Crystal himself couldn't make the creature less annoying.3. Also, James Franco is not nearly a good enough actor to pull off his part. Especially when he is acting acting, its just painful. Although not as painful as the monkey sidekick.This film would have been 2 stars better for the replacement of the monkey ""humour"" with a few songs, there are so many places in the film where a song is called for and we get nothing. The first 20 minutes of the film is especially boring as a result of this.The film also suffers in the writing, a lot of rather dull wooing scenes leading to a very weak motivation for The Wicked Witch of the West turning evil.Also, Bruce Campbell is completely wasted in his tiny cameo role as a gate guard.Finally there is no real lead-in to the original film, no sign of Ruby slippers, no explanation for how Munchkin Land becomes enslaved. Its a good film, but it is not great and certainly not what it could have been, should have been. Oz the Great and Powerful.",Oz the Great and Powerful
252,wjeffer,Stay away! Stay far away!,2,10 March 2013,"I could write a VERY extensive review panning the film, but it might be best to keep my review short and to the point.The trailers were what made me want to see the film. The film was beautiful, almost as visually stunning as ""The Wizard of Oz"" must have been when audiences first saw it in 1939! However, there was nothing about it spectacular enough to detract attention from the convoluted storyline, the terrible script, and the over-the-top (read ""hammy"") acting . . . on EVERYONE'S part, not just James Franco's (though, in the actors' defense, it might be fair to acknowledge they were directed to go ""over the top"" in their performances).This is advice for those who DO NOT have to see it on the big screen - wait for the film to be released to Netflix and Redbox so you can rent it for much less than the price of a ticket. And, if you DO rent it, get people to chip in on the cost so you don't have to pay all of the rental fee.",Oz the Great and Powerful
253,ashtree80,I guess I'm going against popular opinion...,8,30 November 2020,"...but I can't help it! I really, genuinely enjoyed this movie! I am not a die hard Wizard of Oz fan, and I haven't read any of the books, but I like the original classic movie. Maybe people who are hardcore fans of the original don't like this one? Maybe it stays from the novel's? I don't know. I am genuinely surprised that more people didn't like this movie. It is fun and well-paced. I thought Franco was very charming. I liked the pacing, the visuals, and most of the characters. The acting is a little cheesy in a couple parts, and the story is a bit simplistic, but for a family/ children's movie, I think it is a fun, adventurous and imaginative story. Without giving any spoilers, I was left waiting for certain iconic appearances that did not surface.
Why no ruby slippers? Why no black and white striped stockings? And there's a scarecrow, and a lion, but they could have added more tinman. Also, it would have been neat if Auntie Em was at the fair in the opening. Was she there? Did I miss it?

I remember watching it for the first time as a kid and hating that everything was a dream and that water defeated the wicked witch.The great 3D, the likable characters, no water defeating the witch, and not being a dream are big pluses for this movie.

257,bigjackfilms,A Creative Fun Prequel.,7,4 April 2014,"For a prequel to a film that's 75 years old, I thought it was pretty good. It did really well in returning me to Oz. It was colorful, creative, and fun to look at. It also felt like a Tim Burton movie with its score by Danny Elfman. Also, with Sam Rami at the helm as director, had a lot of comedy taken from the Evil Dead trilogy, which I really enjoyed. Though I will admit, there are a few flaws with the movie mostly with characters. But let's talk about the good ones first. Glinda was great, being sort of a comedic cute Galadriel character. The monkey was fun as well, almost had a Steve Bushemi tone. However, it was the china doll that stole the show. Not cause of her cuteness, but the CGI on her is incredible. It was so realistic that I swear I thought they used animatronics. We need more CGI of that in allot of movies now days. Some very surprising cast members also play a role. Tony Cox from Bad Santa fame is funny as always, and Rachel Weisz surprising role as The Wicked Witch Of The East is well portrayed, showing her as the true villain. We even get a great witch duel at the end.Now here's the problems I had with the film, which I did not mind, but are wroth explaining. First of all is Oz himself. Though he is the hero and kind of likable, he's a real jerk. Coning and lying to people constantly. What's worse is he's a womanizer to every female character, except the china doll. He hits on all three witches and even bangs the wicked witch of the west. No, I'm serious; The Wizard Of Oz bangs The Wicked Witch Of The West. Those are words I never thought I'd hear think or say. Speaking of the Witch Of The West, she's done well in my opinion. They did really well in set up her back story. How she became evil, how she got her looks, how she got the broom. They even give her a sympathetic back story to make people feel sorry for her in the following film. This is kind of a downer. The wicked witch of the west is the first villain that we see as children, and it's fitting that we feel fear and hatred over her. But now, oh poor wicked witch, she's got a broken heart and is Darth Vader now. Oh and speaking of Star Wars, there's sort of a master and apprentice between the east and west witches. West is played up as the Vader role while east is a rip off of The Emperor. I swear to god when she's shocking Glenda with her green lightning, all I could play in my mind was. ""Your fitful skills are no match for the power of the Dark Side."" But anyway, back to the west. Her makeup is good and is a fun re- enactment of the original. And how does Mila Kunis do? Well, I'll admit once she becomes the west witch, she looks too young for the role. I honestly think a little bit of old age makeup could have made it look better. This should bring us to the design of the film. For what it is, it looks great. The beginning of the film with its black and white full screen is well done. Though I would have gone of a sepia tone like the original, but no problem. The tornado effect is standard. Once we reach Oz, the screen actually opens up to widescreen, which looks awesome. It feels like Cinerama in a way. While most of Oz looks like table scraps from Tim Burton's Alice In Wonderland, allot of things from the original film look updated and fun like the emerald city and munchkin land. Even the cowardly lion makes a cameo. Also most of the sets are built and look great on camera.One more problem I have with the film is the run time, especially at the end. Don't get me wrong, what was in the film was great, but It could have been trimmed down. I was honestly shocked that the film turned out to be over 2 and a half hours. And the ending, though I liked it, it really dragged. I was literally thinking to myself. ""Okay, movie, why don't we wrap this up. Dorothy's probably in the tornado by now."" So do these errors make the film bad? No. they're passable, but noticeable.Overall, Oz The Great & Powerful is good fun. Though the two main characters are trying, the others are great. The story is fun and truly tells the tale of a man thrust into a fantasy word and becomes a great and powerful con. Plus it sets up characters and plot points extremely well for the original. I would suggest to parents thought to have the kids see it in 2-D than 3-D, only for a few less scares. It's a creative fun prequel.",Oz the Great and Powerful
258,hsjones2112,So much potential... missed.,7,19 March 2013,"""Oz the Great and Powerful"" was the highlight of my weekend with my 10-yr-old daughter. We're both major Oz fans, having read together all of the L. Frank Baum Oz books a few years ago. So we've been looking forward to this release; after seventy-four years and over a hundred books, it's about time someone made a movie from *another* Oz story!Let me give you the bad news first, so you're left with the good news as your final impression. (That's probably the way Baum would do it. ;)I believe that in movies, casting is everything. You can mess up on a lot of things in a movie and *still* achieve greatness if you have the right actors. Likewise, you can have an awesome vision and flawless technical execution, but with the wrong people playing the parts, you'll end up with merely a tease, a suggestion of something that ""could have been."" Unfortunately, that is what ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" is; a suggestion of something that ""could have been."" And the critical failing was the casting of the two main characters. Don't get me wrong; I love James Franco for both the Spider-Man movies and ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes."" But this role was beyond his grasp. I'm sure the producers were hoping to position him as the next Johnny Depp with this movie. Unfortunately, all that Franco's involvement in ""Oz"" produced was the revelation of the limits of his ability and a tragic case of poor casting thwarting a potential Hollywood classic.Franco's shaky Wizard, however, could have survived and still resulted in a great film if his character's foil, Theodora, has been cast differently. Mila Kunis is not only unforgivably bad as Theodora, but is *sinfully* bad as the Wicked Witch of the West, aided and abetted by the horrendous makeup/CGI appearance of said character! Margaret Hamilton's portrayal of the WWOTW in 1939 is not only so iconic, but so *flawlessly perfect* that expectations for any contemporary portrayal are very, very high. Still, everyone involved in the WWOTW's portrayal in this film needs to beg the forgiveness of the masses for NOT EVEN TRYING!!!So... There are the reasons why a 10-star rating (or even a 9) is out of the question. Now, to ponder the good: The story is **exceptional** -- very consistent with the themes and tones of the original books. Gwen and I were both charmed by the story of finding great power in the good intentions of pure souls. And -- not only did the screen writers manage to faithfully honor the original books (right down to the magic slippers ((on Glinda's feet)) being silver, not ""ruby"") -- but they managed to create a new Oz character -- the China Girl -- right out of Baum's own heart. The China Girl (voiced by Joey King) managed to not only steal the show in this film, but to establish herself in one appearance right up there with the Sawhorse of Oz, Ozma, Dorothy, and the rest, as one of the truly great characters of the diverse Oz franchise.Huge kudos to the screenwriters! They get a 10 (of 10). As for the visuals, I can only say ""immensely competent."" I can't find much fault. But expectations for originality these days are just so high... And the opportunity to do something really different for an Oz story was so... THERE... That I take points off for lack of creativity. There were a few scenes -- such as the black and white segments and the backgrounds when The Wizard was walking along casually on his way to The Emerald City -- that suggested potential for a different, creative flavor. But generally, the visuals did not deliver on that promise. They are -- while amazingly incredible compared to what was possible ten years ago -- sadly ""status quo 2013"" and add nothing unique to the film.In summary: A great story, with good but under-potential visuals and lousy casting. The best I could possibly give it is an 8 or 9, but I have to be realistic about the drawbacks and pull it down to a 7 of 10. I hope there is a sequel, a post-Dorothy-arrival story that invests more in the visual design and gets the casting right. Oz is a rich source of material for the screen -- perhaps even more-so than either Narnia or Middle Earth -- if they could just get the right minds involved.",Oz the Great and Powerful
259,AthenaStardear,"Not HFR, but I loved it anyway",9,17 March 2013,"It's just the right length of movie to unfold the story.This movie is a true connection with the famous 1939 movie. I've watched that many times and love it too. Other Oz based movies I've seen have made mince meat of out the original story. I can't remember any of them that connected so well.There were many subtle, and not so subtle connections with the original movie, and I saw most of them. Other people with me saw several that I missed. I'll enjoy watching this 2013 movie again and again.I saw this in 3D at an XD theater. That's not Imax but has enhanced sound and picture. Although motion is not as smooth as HFR 48fps in the Hobbit 3D, scenery and sound was as beautiful as ever. I took away one star for not being filmed in HFR, since that technology is available and should be the norm, not the unique exception that the Hobbit is.While I am pretty good at guessing about events to come in the plot, this one had wonderful fantasy surprises.Although this is a prequel, setting the stage for Dorthy's visit, I thought this was by no means ""just before"" Dorthy's visit. There is an ample gap in the plot elements and age of characters between 1939 and 2013 films for a sequel to fill in with more great adventures. I am hoping for these in the not too distant future.Although this new movie is not a musical, it is a splendorous fantasy.If it was HFR 3D 48fps like the Hobbit, I'd give it 10/10, but alas that's only the Hobbit. So Oz 2013 gets a 9/10. Studios need to get with the newest HFR technology.",Oz the Great and Powerful

And then the opening credits ended and a mediocre movie started. Really. My family walked out at the end and all of us said the opening credits were the best we'd ever seen. The rest... not much happening.My daughter has recently read most of the original Oz books and she was disappointed with how little the plot or characters had to do with the books. My wife was nonplussed that it wasn't Billy Crystal voicing the flying monkey. Zach Braff must have worked hard at sounding exactly like Crystal. But the monkey and the China Girl are simply annoying.We saw the 3d version and the 3D is very well done. Some of the movie is beautiful, but at the center James Franco is miscast.

I would have walked out except I was there with friends, and they seemed to enjoy it, go figure. James Franco, who I have seen act well in the past, seems to have lost his mojo. Mila Kunis, while pretty, acted as well as her boyfriend in real life, Ashton Kutcher, ugh! When she turned green, she did not look right, it did not suit her at all, over acting at its best. Weisz and Williams saved this movie, the only time I was not wanting to yawn or sleep was when they were on screen. And don't even get me started on the side characters, a flying monkey and a porcelain doll, stupid! The dialogue between them all seemed so forced and contrived.

263,cliffcarson-1,Not enough CHARM or WONDER. Dark OZ gone video game route. Suffers from poor Elfman score,5,8 March 2013,"I wanted to like this film, I really did, but alas the overall feel is very disappointing and a bit of a downer. CGI visuals are not enough to give a film charm and this film is lacking in what should have been a basically wonderful and charming story. When did OZ become this violent? Grant it, there are some lovely special effects and the movie is ambitious, but the overall execution is so loud, overbearing and uncomfortable to watch that all the ""wonder"" that should be in this story gets squashed out. Why must these ""re-imagined"" versions of classic tales play like violent video games? The second half of this film is one long jealous bitch fest with a JOHNNY GUITAR showdown between the women. Some criticism has been directed to James Franco as the Wizard, but his casting is actually one of the refreshing aspects. The actor has enough charm to carry a picture like this while Michelle Williams grasps her role nicely. Too bad the two best parts in the picture are mediocre. Mila Kunis as Theodora is the films biggest disappointment. Her witch looks and acts like a demon possessed, relying too heavily on the make-up for performance. Her character also begs logic. The Wizard danced with her once, yet this moment is what turns her heart to vengeance and ever lasting demonic rage. Rachel Weisz is pretty if not standard, but who could ever find that grotesque CGI monkey lovable? He was hard to look at. On the good side there a wonderful title sequence at the beginning and a lovely CGI porcelain doll that practically steals the picture. Definitely the sweetest aspect of a story that should have been filled with sweet moments rather than violent and dark ones. This is The Wizard of Oz, not OLIVER TWIST. Action sequences will remind you of the humor in Raimi's EVIL DEAD. Finally what the film really suffers from is a lackluster Danny Elfman score. Nothing new in his music. Your mind flushes it out as soon as it hears it. So much of it doesn't fit the scene it's arranged for.",Oz the Great and Powerful
264,Convictions,A visual treat,7,20 March 2013,"For those who haven't seen Oz The Great and Powerful yet, this is a prequel to the Wizard of Oz. Though, this is pretty much Alice in Wonderland 2.0. Regardless, I still enjoyed Oz The Great and Powerful and it beats Alice in Wonderland by a whisker. It's a little odd to believe that Sam Raimi directed this. This isn't his best work but, in this awful start to the year Oz is one of the few to emerge on top.I'm not really going to spend any more time typing up the plots of films but, it's basically a magician named Oscar Diggs (James Franco) getting blown into the land of Oz where he meets the three witches. Then, he ends up fighting for the Land of Oz after he realizes that there's more than just wanting to become rich and famous. There's more to the plot but, that's pretty much the gist of it.I enjoyed Oz but, I had a few issues with it. It's mostly from the acting department. Some of the performances were flat and wooden. The most obvious is Mila Kunis. I guess it's no spoiler that she's the wicked witch (just look at the posters) but, she isn't wicked enough. I like Kunis but, this is her least inspired performance. The cartoonish make-up doesn't help either. Nothing against the make-up artists as everything else in nicely done, but her make-up job was just laughable to me. To make things even more awkward, she doesn't have any chemistry with Franco at all in the beginning. I guess that has to do with Franco also being flat, though not as much as Kunis. So when she says she's in love with him it's unconvincing and out of place. The only time there's really a spark between Franco and someone else is when he's with Michelle Williams. Other than those things, everything else was just fine.Now I know most people are going to avoid the 3-D but, I have to say I was impressed by it. There was only some noticeable blur when we first reach Oz. Other than that, the light levels seemed normal. There wasn't any dimness, everything was bright and beautiful. The picture quality was clear and the filmmakers manage to utilize the 3-D well. Things pop out of the screen but, not so much that it ends up feeling like it was just a gimmick. If you have the extra money I'd say it wouldn't hurt to invest it in the 3-D. I'm sure you'd have just as much fun in 2-D, but this is one of the rare times I can argue for 3-D.Though I said some of the performances were flat, the rest certainly weren't. Michelle Williams gives a sweet performance as Glinda, while Rachel Weisz gives that wickedness that's needed for her character. I'm surprised that didn't carry over to Kunis since she was by Weisz's side for a good portion of the film. Zach Braff does a nice job playing Franco's assistant in the beginning and does some excellent vocal work as Finley. Same goes for Joey King, though her human role wasn't nearly as big as Braffs in the beginning. Lastly, we have Bill Cobbs who left a good impression as Master Tinker. The rest of the cast did a nice job with their limited parts.Overall, this is a visual treat for the whole family. Sure some of the performances weren't anything spectacular and the chemistry between Franco and Kunis wasn't there. However, everything else makes up for these things. The rest of the cast is great, the visuals are stunning, the 3-D is well utilized, and the pacing is nice. It's a 2 hour and 10 minute film yet it only felt like a half hour. With a lack of family films (both in terms of quantity and quality) thus far, Oz certainly is the one we've been waiting for.",Oz the Great and Powerful
265,brycecab,Truly great and powerful!,8,1 February 2014,"I love Sam Raimi's movies and I loved L. Frank Baum's works too. But what I would really like is their creations combined together. I enjoyed Sam Raimi's ""Spider-Man"" movies. I watched this in a theater with the whole family. I watched the trailer a lot of times because I was really excited to see this.""Oz the Great and Powerful"" is exactly what the title says. It was a GREAT movie and it made a POWERFUL impact on the audience in the theater. Everyone was laughing, some were crying and everyone went home with a smile on their face. James Franco was perfect as the Oz. Mila Kunis, Michelle Williams, and Rachel Weisz did good themselves. The visuals and the cinematography was extremely amazing. The humor was perfect. The story was great as well. This is Sam Raimi's greatest movie yet.Highly recommended for the whole family (especially in 3D)",Oz the Great and Powerful
266,damh_frikinlater,The Post-Pirate of the Caribbean Version of Oz,7,8 March 2013,"Funny, entertaining and is worth catching it in the movies but, it is not as great as many expected.Visually this movie is great. The first act is entirely black and white in a 16mm format that is too small for the big screen. What makes it so great is that director Sam Raimi decides that the location set was going to look just like the original Wizard of Oz (1939), fake. So it feels like if you were looking at a movie produced on the 40's. Then, as we enter to Oz, the image expands and fit to the screen with the brighter colors. And so the journey begins worthy of an attraction on Disney World.The computer effects looks as it should look in a movie that cost $200 millions. Very much of the technique used on them make you desire for once seen it on 3D. So I'm safe to say that this movie should be quite an experience in IMAX 3D. Of course, nothing looks real. But that's the point, is a magic land, the creatures in there are not suppose to look real but magical.The cast job is very hard to appreciate. Oz is a man that lies for a living, so every time he is in public he acts like if he were on stage. The problem is that Oz is always on public, so he is always trying to hide his true nature. So it is hard to say if James Franco is doing a terrific job or if he is doing his greatest performance yet playing a dude that is playing a dude. The same happens with Rachel Weisz. She is a witch and you can't tell when she is doing a bad job or if the movie required that she acts like that so everybody can tell when she is faking.Michelle Williams and Mila Kunis are the ones that bring some serious acting to the screen. Of course their characters are not serious, but at least they act in public like they act in private so you don't have to think which scenes were good acting because all of them are. Is the same with the voice of Zach Braff (he is the flying monkey), his character stay natural all the time.The biggest defect of this movie is that runs for 130 minutes and you can feel every minute of it. It is not boring, but either is this epic adventure that is so cool that time flies and you don't even notice. The reason why this happens maybe is because it last more than it should. It is a good story but, maybe could have tell it in less time and leave the audience wanting more, not thinking ""God, this movie is quite long"". So, if the 1939 movie runs 100 minutes with songs in it, this movie was suppose to run the same time without the singing.The most memorable moment of the movie is when the Evil Witch appears; green, with the big nose, the pointing hat, the black dress and the broom. She has an entrance worthy of post Pirate of the Caribbean's Disney. On the other side, you may hate the character of Oz, the guy is a jerk.It's good to catching this movie just for fun. It is better than Alice in Wonderland of 2010 so if you liked that one, then you might love this one. All is left to say is that Disney already ordered the sequel but Sam Raimi said that he will not be the one behind it.",Oz the Great and Powerful
267,brett-donald,A mixed bag,5,27 February 2014,"A serviceable enough film, if you like witches and evil magic, which I happen not to. In the 1939 film, the witch is nasty and comic at the same time, but not malevolent and not too frightening for the little ones. Times have changed! In this film, Evanora (although well acted by Rachel Weisz) is just pure evil, with no redeeming features, and no explanation of why she is evil. Theodora starts out innocent and naive, so we get interested in her character, but after she is turned evil, she changes so completely that any feeling we had for her evaporates. So, the evil side of the story needed considerable refinement.I was also disappointed at the lack of humour throughout. The humour in the 1939 film is incredibly corny and in some cases feels forced, but at least they tried, and the film as a whole doesn't take itself too seriously. This one tries instead to entertain us purely with effects, the script can only be described as weak.However, the film looks great, and the good characters are likable. I became invested in Oscar's character early on, and enjoyed watching his journey from con man to hero ... so I thought he was well conceived, well cast and well acted. Some might think James Franco's acting was reluctant, but his character is supposed to be that way. Michelle Williams is excellent as Glinda, she gave her character more depth than all the others put together, showing us courage, kindness and gentleness, intelligence and intuition, but you can also really feel the heavy burden of grief she carries just below the surface. Her portrayal really suits the story, but she hardly ever smiles, which is disappointing because Michelle is just so, so pretty when she smiles.",Oz the Great and Powerful
268,moviefanintheusa,I was pleasantly surprised.,10,7 July 2013,"I was really not expecting much of this film, but found it highly entertaining! I thought it was a really cool prequel to The Wizard of Oz. I can't help but notice that some of the negative reviews for this film point out that it does not live up to the 1939 MGM classic. For goodness sake, it's not trying to! This film is telling it's own story. And I found the special effects neat and the characters are cool, I really liked all the back stories they gave. In The Wizard of Oz, you don't know much about a lot of the characters (such as Glinda or the wizard). I thought that this film gave them a pretty cool, epic back story. There is some humor in the film which works great. They also tie it in with the 1939 film in a cool way; this film also starts in black and white then changes to color. And the film's cinematography is great, as well as the 3D effects.",Oz the Great and Powerful

Everything about this movie left me a bit disappointed. The acting on everyone apart from some minor characters and James Franco left much to be desired. Mila Kunis starts out average, ends even worst. Weisz and Williams never actually deliver, the visual effects are mediocre at best and the soundtrack is hardly memorable. For a series known for its fantasy and beloved characters, its memorable tunes and brilliant actors who performed in iconic roles that were originated by it, it feels sad this movie oh so failed to deliver.",Oz the Great and Powerful
270,RyanNilsen,Oz the Great and Powerful movie review,6,10 March 2013,"Oz the Great and Powerful Directed by Sam Raimi Starring: James Franco, Mila Kunis, Zach Braff, Rachel Weisz, and Michelle Williams""We're off to see the Wizard, the wonderful Wizard of Oz! Because, because, because, because all the wonderful things he does!"" The well known song from the 1933 classic, involving Dorothy, Toto, and the rest of the rambunctious gang. Oz the Great and Powerful is a prequel to that epic tale. However, it was not so ""great"" or ""powerful"". Don't get me wrong; it was a satisfying flick, following the man behind the curtain himself. There was just a feeling of too much Hollywood and childish banter. Oz has a terrific opening; similar to The Wizard of Oz's being black and white, then once arriving in Oz the beautiful color comes in. Nevertheless, from there on it becomes an uninteresting story with repetitive jokes for a long hour and thirty minutes. Oz, a small-time magician goes on a journey in Oz, ""where he must decide if he will be a good man or a great one."" It is not until the end, where Oz becomes somewhat memorable and all the actors shine. The only thing that kept me watching the entire movie was the incredible special affects enhanced with 3D glasses. It is some of the best 3D you will ever see. Director Sam Raimi (Spider-Man trilogy) and his special effects team have won awards in the past, but Oz's visuals are remarkable. This is one of James Franco's (Rise of the Planet of the Apes) best performances and I have a feeling not the last time we see him as "" Oz"". When all is said and done, Oz the Great and Powerful is a satisfying prequel that may not live up to expectations, but how could it?",Oz the Great and Powerful
271,JackVenturo,Three point of view review.,9,3 January 2017,"Can you guess what my favorite movie is? STAR WARS! Well no that's my favorite saga. My favorite stand-alone movie is ""The Wizard of Oz"". I have a bit of a movie memorabilia collection in my studio. Don't you judge me! Needless to say I was very excited as well as very skeptical about this so called unofficial prequel. Especially in this troubled CGI world of ours and most of all when I saw ""Trailer no.1"". at the point where ""and the producer of Alice in Wonderland"" came up on the screen I cringed and had nightmares of crazy moving cameras and fancy creatures with sparkly heads and fluid faces and 3D headaches. And then the river fairies come into the shot and those weird piranha plants and I knew! Deep down I knew! They would ruin my OZ with CGI!But those where little nothings in the scheme of the grand canvas that is ""OZ the Great and Powerful""Jack ""The Film Lover"" says... I loved this movie. I sat back and watched it with one eye closed expecting to see something bad! You know, kind of like waiting for toast to pop out. But nothing really bad happened. It had a good story and good points, and it was fun! I loved all the nods to ""The Wizard of OZ"", and loved that we are introduced to things that you will see in the next movie. You get some questions answered and even though we all know the rules you still get a couple of surprises. ""Only bad witches are ugly"" and boy are they ugly!There are so many layers to the OZ films that once can go crazy psycho analyzing them! That actually would be a fun night. Even though we now have a backstory to why the witch hates pretty girls, why there is a feud between her and OZ why is the wizard a man behind the curtain? There are still so many unanswered questions Is OZ a real place? If Dorothy went there, saw Oscar the Wizard who IS still there, and came back then it must be a real place Are the ruby slippers the only way out? Their power is the power to leave OZ? The witch's plan was to leave and come here to the real world? If so would they be going to Kansas? Why two different people almost 50 years apart both got sucked into the OZ Vortex in the same state? Is Kansas a wormhole to a parallel universe where your farmhands are animals and creatures? Or is it children's limbo! Where the dead go to wait to be judged? But it wasn't Dorothy's time yet so they sent her back? In a parallel land that still has North, South, East and West? Blow your mind!Jack ""The Filmmaker"" says I had problems with some things I had a problem with the lion, don't ask, just watch it and get back to me. I had a problem with the CGI! Not the characters themselves, the monkeys where done right. I mean the landscapes and moving parts and extravagant camera movements that are so far-fetched the people themselves must be CGI to be in them! When the Director of photography says the phrase ""Camera cranes can't go that high!"" and the Director says ""Who needs a camera ANIMATE IT!"" we have a problem! I feel weird about James Franco! I like him, I hear he will be in a movie and I say ""WHY?"" then I watch it and can't picture anyone else in it and he does a good job. He was wholesome in this with a big dash of con man and it worked. The witches where amazing, Mila Kunis was acting like something else we have never seen and she didn't sound like Meg! (Family Guy) Which is a plus! WITCH is a plus, which old Witch? The Wicked Witch! (and now that song is stuck in your head)Jack ""The Parent"" says DUH Take the kids Well take MY kids because they all loved it! They are 4, 9 and 10 years old. We saw it in 3D so be careful of the jump at your face elements, there are some jolts that make you sit back like the monkeys and the witch at some points. And there is a bit of some tear-jerking moments at the end but aside from that it's a good story for them to follow.In a magical world not everything is what it seems, not everyone is telling the truth and you should not try to be someone you are not for the sake of a loved one. Be yourself and do your best with what talents you have. You don't have to have magic powers to save the day! You can be anyone's hero if you believe in yourself!",Oz the Great and Powerful

273,simplisticreviewsblogspo,Great and Powerful indeed,8,25 March 2013,"Review by DJ:Little self involvement time. I haven't written a review in a while mainly because I've been busy preparing content for our monthly podcast here at Simplistic Reviews. (SELF PROMOTION DURING SELF PROMOTION...SO AWESOME) Anyway, when the days between reviews started piling up, I became cautious picking the PROPER comeback movie to review next. (I was this close to reviewing Parker there for a minute, so count your blessings.) This week, however, I happened to go against my previous judgement and against many preconceived assumptions by the masses and watch a film that made me anxious to talk about. The film is Oz The Great And Powerful. A movie that I have heard maligned even before it came out. A movie that certainly does not deserve it.Oz The Great And Powerful is a....DUN DUN DUUUUN!!!...prequel to the 1939 cinematic classic The Wizard Of Oz. And for those who have been hiding under a rock in a cave in Timbuktu, The Wizard of Oz is about a Kansas girl named Dorothy who is whisked away by a tornado and sent to a magical world where wicked witches are the norm, munchkins are a plenty, and lions are cowardly. Dorothy journeys to find a supposed wizard who can send her back home. That wizard...74 YEAR SPOILER ALERT...turns out to be just a man behind a curtain named Oz. Oz The Great And Powerful fills in all the blanks on how he got there and why certain witchly characters got their wickedness.Now maybe because I've had to re-watch Star Wars episodes 1 through 3 for my 9 to 5 job, I'm standing on a hyperbole soapbox here. However, I don't regret saying that Oz The Great And Powerful is one of the greatest....DUN DUN DUUUUN!!!....prequels ever made. My favorite, by the way is The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly. When the familiar pieces of The Wizard Of Oz began to neatly fall into place in Oz The Great And Powerful, I got the same feeling I had when Blondie picks up that iconic poncho. The same feeling I didn't get when Lucas clumsily dropped his pieces on the ground, brushed off and forced onto me at the last minute. The Good The Bad And The Ugly sets up a world that, frankly, is pretty easy to set up. The Wizard Of Oz is anything but. It has enough oddly shaped moving parts to make an Ikea salesman blush. (Rimshot. Nailed it.) One day I'll have a discussion about how the land of Oz is just an imaginary place where one subconsciously goes to work out their inner issues. A theme this film duplicates and also nails by the way. However, for the sake of avoiding an even bigger moniker as an overly- analytical, auteur theory douche, I'll stick with the simple things that make this film work.I was very surprised that Tim Burton's Alice In Wonderland disappointed me. I thought that his famously quirky style would be perfect for the material. It is why I was worried that director Sam Raimi might stumble into the same pitfalls with Oz The Great And Powerful. Alice In Wonderland and The Wizard Of Oz are two worlds that are terrific at hiding morose, gruesome, and inappropriate subtext under colorful, shiny, childish window dressing. Burton brought more of the morose subtext to the light, thus dragging down Alice In Wonderland away from what it was intended. Whereas, Raimi keeps the balance and tone of his film's predecessor. I believe Raimi knew it was suicide to mess with a formula as delicate as The Wizard Of Oz. Burton made subtext the focal point when he should have remembered it is the wonder the makes the world. Raimi thrives here and never takes his eye off the ball.Despite being an actor I very well should hate, I can't help but like James Franco. Perhaps it is his 'in on the joke' personality and the fact he never takes himself too seriously that disarms me. His talent, when he's trying, is undeniable. This isn't Franco's finest work but I believe he's perfectly cast as Oz. Oz is a failed showman. A man with the potential for great things, but seems to never be 100% genuine. A man you want to expose as a fraud not laud as a talent. Franco seems to fit the bill. Since Spider-Man Raimi has seemed to know how to use Franco's more unpopular tendencies. His mugging for the camera never feels out of place in a Raimi film. And his tender moments, ones that would be cheesy in any other film, seem right at home here. Rachel Weisz and Michelle Williams stand tall, where other actors would sleepwalk. That includes Weisz's great nod to, coincidentally Return Of The Jedi, and having a sorcery battle with Williams that rivals even that of Gandalf and Saruman. But the stand out here is Mila Kunis. She has been proving since That 70s Show that shes not just a pretty...pretty...pretty...damn she's pretty...face. It is probably known to all her role in the film. However, I won't spoil it other than to say she completely humanized and made me empathize with a character I thought would be impossible to. Oz The Great And Powerful isn't the greatest film you'll see this year by a longshot. But it knows what it wants to be, it knows what it has to be, and accomplishes these things nearly perfectly. Don't believe me? Close your eyes and imagine for a moment what you deem a PROPER...DUN DUN DUUUUN!!!...prequel to one of the most classic, iconic, and 'out there' films in almost the last hundred years. Click your heals three times, open your eyes, watch Oz The Great And Powerful...then tell me I'm wrong.For more reviews, go to simplisticreviews.blogspot.com",Oz the Great and Powerful

James Franco was cr*p, and totally unlikeable. Mila Kunis gave an odd, over the top performance. Ha, which leads me on to another thing.. She was literally over the top of all her tops in the movie.. 3 female characters all wore cleavage revealing corsets, and fawn all over male character. They're supposed to be witches ffs, and *spoiler* even when Mila Kunis turns into the wicked witch she rips her top off (for no apparent reason), turns green and warty, but still has a low cut cleavage revealing corset dress going on. Eh? When I was a kid witches were wicked, a bit scary, and probably covered in warts but not really sexy.. Does everything female have to be sexy? No need.

275,Left-Handed_Liz,A mixed bag of Hollywood magic tricks,6,13 March 2013,"""Ordinary people can accomplish great things,"" a fellow theater-goer told me. ""That's what the message of the film is."" I believe that was the intent of the film, but it's also a story that's been done a lot, with mixed results. And this version of the story, like the magician Oz's parlor trick collection, can succeed or fail to deliver that message, depending on the audience. It ultimately utilizes its talents to make something impressive and fairly enjoyable, even if you can see the wires sometimes. The visuals, of course, are amazing, with the lush color saturation not only dazzling to the senses, but also a fitting homage to the 1939 classic, along with the black and white opening scenes (one of my favorite parts of the film). The big difference, of course, is CGI, which gives everything in the land that superficial, plastic smoothness lacking in the era of soundstages. The ingenuity of the cyclone effect from the original film still can't be beat. Thankfully, the special effects, while plentiful, are rarely distracting, save for the flying objects thrust out for the benefit of the 3D crowd. At their worst, they're manipulative, not enhancing the atmosphere as much as giving the feeling that you're already in the virtual reality theme-park ride Disney will most likely produce. What made me cheer the most- indeed, brought the film back from the brink- was the simple utilization of a screen projector on a billow of smoke and fire to create the head of the ""Great and Powerful Oz"" for the first time during the razzle-dazzle climax of the movie.Like Tim Burton's Wonderland, this Oz uses the original books' contents for atmosphere and characters, but mainly sticks to public consciousness for everything else. The film shows us a gleaming Emerald City already there when Oz arrives, but in the books, the Emerald City was his idea, and simply appeared green, because all its citizens wore tinted glasses- another con. By contrast, the film's more positive view of the ""humbug"" Oz works for the ""ordinary people can become great"" moral, and I'd be lying if I said that the climax, with artificial magic, spirit and cleverness triumphing over ""wickedness,"" didn't make me smile with the way it was executed. I enjoyed the performances of all the supporting cast (the most important part of a fantasy movie, in my opinion), and the leads all turn in decent to above-average performances, with Mila Kunis, sadly, being the weakest link. As many critics have harped upon, the ingenuity of the visuals and mythology of Oz is somewhat lacking from the development of the plot and characters. In spite of the title of the film, I think that it would have been a much stronger story if the focus had been on the power struggle between the witches, something barely touched on until the final battle, where it is reduced to a single duel between Glinda and the scheming Evanora. The witches' power and capability is never fully utilized, as even the wise and motherly Glinda waits passively for the next move of a Wizard that everyone suspects (and that she knows) is a fraud. It's possible to argue that she was in control the whole time, secretly testing his character as she did with Dorothy, but the film never explores that idea, even though she's one of the main protagonists. Likewise, Mila Kunis's Theodora could, and should have been as fascinating as an iconic villain always is. The notion that she was once an open-hearted, loving person, manipulated into evil by wrath and envy (her skin being tinted green in her transformation) is, on paper, rather compelling, but the flat caricature we get reduces *the* wicked witch to end all witches to the jilted psycho ex-girlfriend of a philandering James Franco, with no real motivation of her own to speak of. That's not only insulting to a great character, but downright sexist. As clever, charming and plucky as the future Wizard of Oz is in this film, in a different version of this story he would have been a pawn in the witches' political games, not fawned over by them for his con-man charm. He might have discovered some inner strength, but he would probably have ended up a largely symbolic figurehead, not rewarded with a romance with Glinda for his good heart. And part of me would really like to see that movie instead, but part of me is just happy this got made in the first place. Overall, I'd give it a watch. It's not as bad as you probably think it is, but it's not the best movie I've ever seen. I hope that we get more creative Oz stories in the future that are just as entertaining, but aren't so mainstream Hollywood.",Oz the Great and Powerful
276,staff-577-378882,Oz the Great and Powerful Movie Review,9,8 March 2013,"Was Sam Raimi able to pave the road to Oz in gold or were there one too many pitfalls along the road for this prequel. Oz The Great and Powerful tells the story of Oscar Diggs, better known by his stage name Oz, a small time circus magician whose quick hands and quicker tongue often get him into trouble. When Oz's lies and womanizing ways finally catch up to him, Oz makes his grand escape on a hot air balloon. Oz's grand escape plan takes a turn for the worse when his hot air balloon gets sucked into a tornado and finds himself in the magical Land of Oz.The film is both a prequel and Raimi's homage to the classic film The Wizard of Oz. From the very beginning Raimi captures the feeling of the classic by opening the movie in black and white with black bars on the side to replicate an old square television set. This nice homage give way for one of the most visual striking scenes in the file, when Oz first looks onto the Land of Oz and the film slowly and gradually widening the screen and adding color to the world. The effect managed to add a nice touch to the Land of Oz that gives it that special magical feeling the world needed.The special effects in the movie are a two way street that are both amazing and damning. The world of Oz is colorful and magical. The backdrops and landscapes of Oz are amazing and manage to give life to the world. The CG animation in the movie is smooth and detailed that one would expect from a summer blockbuster film. The one problem I had with the CG, which is found in many movies that rely on CG too much to create entire backgrounds, is that there are often times when the actors and the CG just don't blend right and it really stands out in some scenes. While this isn't a major problem, it does at times take you out of the film.For those moments it takes a good cast to bring the view back around, and luckily for this film the cast couldn't have been better. James Franco pulls in another great performance as the lovable yet womanizing, lying, and selfish Oz. Yet even with the stunning Franco who easily carries this film has the entire movie stolen from him by the three witches Michelle Williams as Gilda, Rachel Weisz as Evanora, and Mila Kunis as Theodora. The three ladies do a fantastic job and you can tell they are absolutely enjoying their roles. I especially enjoyed Kunis for her commanding and chilling performance as Theodora. If it wasn't for her performance, Theodora would have been such a terrible and wasted character. Theodora comes off throughout the film as such utterly stupid that its almost ridiculous how blind and naive the character is suppose to be. Kunis, however, manages to make something memorable here that will make any Wizard of Oz fan proud.While the movie isn't perfect my any means, Oz is entertaining and fun for the whole family. Raimi brings you back to the Land of Oz with the same old heart and soul that made you believe long ago.",Oz the Great and Powerful
277,faithisagoodthing,Brilliant prequel on its way to becoming a classic also,10,20 April 2013,"Everything about this movie was perfect. James Franco played an awesome Oz and deserved much more respect than he was given by the media, but media seems to have their own agenda when it comes to him anyway.Also, Mila Kunis and everyone else involved was fantastic too.I can see myself watching this movie, over and over again at every holiday opportunity.Oh, importantly in no way shape or form, did this prequel insult the classic The Wizard of Oz but just added to the greatness.Thank you Sam Raimi for respecting the classic plus L. Frank Baum.This is a great and powerful family movie and Disney should be proud also.",Oz the Great and Powerful
278,hudson-todd,Absolute Rubbish,3,16 January 2019,"I was extremely disappointed with this film. An origin story for Oz the Great and Powerful, as a concept, has the potential for a lot of heart; this film delivers none. To start with, the casting is very poor; James Franco does not have the charisma to pull off Oz, even had the character been better written. The three witches are all very dull and flimsy. Some of the actors are capable, if miscast, but it is doubtful that any actors, however talented, could have made much out of so flimsy a script. The animation is poor, and seems to have counted on cheap 3D gimmicks. By comparison, the 1939 masterpiece is far more visually satisfying. Even the Emerald City, with all its potential for splendor, looks like a cheaply painted cardboard model. In terms of continuity with the 1939 masterpiece, there is very little.",Oz the Great and Powerful
279,kez0,Better than Expected,7,28 March 2013,"I didn't go into this movie with too many expectations because I assumed it was a younger kid movie and I was not within the target audience, but I discovered that I liked this movie more than I expected!Oz the Great and Power Full gives audiences a look into the story that set up the original ""Wizard of Oz"" movie (although according to some friends, it is a completely different prequel of the original than portrayed in ""Wicked"" the musical). Parts of the movie are animated, parts are live action, but most is a combination of the two. Pros -Many elements (phrases, iconic symbols, characters) were similar to and foreshadowed what occurs in the original ""Wizard of Oz"" movie. (One of the main reasons I really liked this movie) - Animated parts of the movie were very colorful and visually beautiful -Cast for the most part was able to play their characters well -Loved the way the movie started out black and whiteCons -Costumes fell a little short in my opinion. I felt like more detailed clothing and props could have been used -SPOILER: Where were the ruby slippers? -SPOILER (and opinion) Ending the movie with the house falling on Evanora, ready to pick up right into the original 'Wizard of Oz"" film, would have been a way to make the movie even betterI recommend this movie for pretty much anyone, but I believe that people who know the original story of ""Wizard of Oz"" would enjoy it even more. Some scenes could scare small children, although this is not really a scary movie; there is plenty of humor.7/8 stars",Oz the Great and Powerful
280,tictack,could have been done with animated characters,5,13 March 2013,"For thoughts, It seems few of them took the movie seriously enough. James Franco,really?? Looks utter mismatch for the cast and proves it so, and is this the same Mila Kunis we witnessed in Black Swan?? Looks appealing but acts appalling. Rachel weisz restores a little bit of sanity to the proceedings. Great attempt has been made to pack the visual effects and in the cosmetics of the movie but little bit effort on the plot and the performances would have gone a long way. Coming to the movie, being a fantasy movie does not mean it takes away scope of building a real good story and extracting real good acting which somehow seems to be the case. Oz's transition from real world to a fantasy world and some non sense happening inside is laughable, although the bigger purpose of the movie of having descent 3D effects and entertaining the audience has been served somehow. There are few funny moments thanks to the flying monkey and other characters. But the actors overall do not add too much into it so Oz and the witches as well could have been animated and would not have made a difference such little is the effect of their performances.",Oz the Great and Powerful
281,nightshadow101,Fantastic,10,11 March 2013,"Oh where to begin? First I don't understand as to why this film only has 7.1/10. It should be rated higher than that but oh well. Oz the Great and Powerful stars James Franco as Oscar Diggs aka Oz who must come to decide whiter if he is a good man or a great one after being whisked into the wonderful land of Oz from a tornado in Kansa. I loved how Sam Raimi patched things up. When the film began it opened in classical black and white with a lower picture ratio. We see Oscar doing his carnival acts. Then the movie is presented in brilliant colour and the 3D and the special effects is breathtaking. If you think you keep wasting money as so many movies that shouldn't be converted in 3D then I promise you this Oz movie won't disappoint as I was really taken away with it and how Sam really made sure that it was spot on. Then me meet Mila Kunis as Evenora I think thats her name who at first is charming and sweet. But little would we expect for she to transform into the wicked witch of the west. Then we meet Michelle Williams and I forgot the other actresses name please forgive who deliver their roles. To people who thought the characters were bland and the actors were poorly miscast then you all were sleeping in this film as I found that they all delivered life to their characters really well making them likable. Plus James Franco did a fine job as Oz and he also improved on his character by adding some comedic touches throughout the film. overall i found the movie well shot, the 3D was spot on and I think Sam did a great job on this film.",Oz the Great and Powerful
282,asu-ray20,watch it.......it worths your time,6,29 May 2013,"Oz the great and the powerful....let me say the director of the epic spider man series Sam Raimi has given another movie of fantasy which would definitely take you to a new world . Its a movie which is highly dependent upon its graphics and special effects ...and it should be also to give a clear view of a world of wearied creatures and wizards.it has a good plot,and the cast seemed to do well.PLOT-In 1905 Kansas, Oscar Zoroaster works as a small-time magician in a traveling circus. As a storm approaches, the circus strongman knows Oscar has flirted with his wife and goes to attack him. Oscar escapes in a hot air balloon, but is sucked into a tornado that takes him to the Land of Oz.their he meets with Theodora (one of the three witch sisters) tells him about the prophecy ..and he would be the next king after defeating the wicked wizard.the plot moves smoothly with a suspense of who really the wicked wizard is.oz as he is a con man,cheats on Theodora and her sister Evanora provokes her to convert into Wicked Witch of the West.Theodora and Evanora raise a battle against Glinda and oz.Oz uses his skills of illusion to win the battle.CAST-James Franco created lots of humor in the character of Oz.the three sisters Theodora,Evanora and Glinda played by Mila Kunis,Rachel Weisz and Michelle Williams were portrayed quite well.the graphics of the movie was eye pleasing.it had some movements of comedy,but it is a one time watch that's why i gave it 6/10.",Oz the Great and Powerful

284,paul-3991,Wanted to Like it... But!,5,8 March 2013,"My wife & I watch (& Like) a lot of movies others don't, but even WE were left VERY disappointed. A poor script of actor ""lines"" combined with their surprisingly poor performance, & you have a recipe for disaster. And this indeed was a disaster! Sadly, as we wanted to like this movie. In fact the previews looked so promising that we wanted to love this movie! But a rush through characters ""emotional changes"" & going through the motions of presenting their ""motivations"", left us doubting the character's even more! (Poor ongoing character development ruined what was a very good storyline.) It started out okay, but the lack of time given for actual character development along with poor acting totally kept pulling us out of the movie. Character development was nothing more than flat stereotypes. The CGI character ""China Girl"" was more believable & ""emotionally real"" than any other character in the whole movie! Her performance (& Lines) were at least believable!While some scenes & effects were indeed great at times, & the plot/story well thought out & very good, the acting (sounding like people reading cue-cards) & dialog/script/lines were poor to terrible. Again, this totally pulled us out of the movie & were unbelievable. We personally loved the movie John Carter, in which character development & acting were superb & believable, pulling us INTO an already terrific storyline. We would have loved a sequel to it & don't understand why it didn't do as well as Disney had hoped. JC was one of our top movies & not once were we pulled out of the story because of acting, lines or effects. It was utterly fantastic compared to this piece of junk! (And we WANTED to like this movie & kept trying to give it a chance to get better!)""Oz"" was totally destroyed by poor acting & very poor script writing/dialog. Unconvincing characters. Franco & Kunis were the worst, but Weisz was terrible also. And Williams lines made us not care about her character at all. She seemed very flat, & on antidepressants or something! The ""okay at best"" acting combined with terrible lines was like gas on a fire, which burned all chances of this being a movie people could be absorbed into. All the special effects in the would couldn't save it! This was TV quality acting at best! Sad! And we expected a lot better from Raimi! (And Disney!) Didn't he see people weren't ""becoming"" the characters? That's a professional? ...to not even notice that the actors weren't delivering! Seems to me the wrong actors were chosen for the job!Most special effects were good to excellent, esp. China Doll & the ending ""Wizard's"" appearance in the smoke/conflict scenes, & story here VERY well written! However elsewhere some of the effects were rather clumsy.(The witches flying looked like they were afraid while wearing the line harnesses, clumsy & awkward at best.) I added one point for CGI effects & a half+ for the 3D work, which alone were VERY well done. But it just shows that a very good story & good special effects can be destroyed & wasted without having believable characters. How did professionals not realize just how bad things were during filming? Even I could have done better at times, & I'm not even an actor! So sad! A real major disappointment, even though our expectations were no higher than wanting to see a decent movie with believable characters! And we don't even have high standards! Delivering lines is NOT acting! Instead of wasting time with unnessary & endless CGI flowers & such, spending some time on characters & THEIR changes & INNER workings is more important. Even before eating poison apples, they all lacked Heart! Even when that heart is evil or silly or whatever, if not presented well it doesn't exist. If the special effects were handled like the characters were, they would have used painted cardboard stage settings & finger puppets for lifeforms. Doing that would have at least been in balance with the characters & their acting/lines. (I thought better of these actors actually.)Story/plot-8.5 Decent plot. Not terrific, but very very good. Special Effects-6 to 10 (again, some sloppy/clumsy) CGI- 8.5 (Perhaps I would have thought more if the acting didn't pull me out.) Acting - 3.5 (If that!) Script Writing/Dialog - 2.5 (Who wrote their lines? Is this their first attempt?) Character development/Continuity/Flow of character changes/emotions- 2 Just because I see someone with the person I love & someone else tells me that they came on to them, what?... I am going to totally freak out right away & destroy the world? (A few questionable incidents & manipulation by my evil sister may be motivation, but what they did here was ridiculous!) And to be immediately duped into eating a poison apple!? Come-on, not another Disney poison apple! Couldn't even make it a ""potion"" to numb the pain of love lost? An apple! And 2 seconds of heart-ache without much emotional suffering immediately makes her go ballistic? Jeez! TOTALLY rushed thru the most important character change/development in the whole movie! And where were the Munchkins & others? All they used were kids in funky outfits! How rank! There were few actual Emerald City/Oz characters shown... just KIDS! Come-on! More budget cuts to get the children of friends & family into your movie? How about REAL actors like the old Wiz/of/Oz movie! They were terrific compared to this sham!We really wanted to love this movie & it had such high potential. Very good story, great CGI... but nothing else to pull us into Oz. Just flat acting & poor ""lines"" to get us in there! Nice Disney! You really have lost your way!",Oz the Great and Powerful
285,LadyComplainer,"A Cheap Seat, Big Screen Movie",10,28 July 2013,"If you haven't seen it already, then you need to but hurry because seeing it on the big screen is going to be the best experience for ""Oz The Great and Powerful"". The ""cheap seats"" at Tempe Cinema (cash only) has enormous screens that are every penny of the $6 you pay. The only downside to this theater is that you can only pay in cash but the upside is that they are cheap and have a cup you can buy and reuse and only pay a dollar per reuse after the initial charge for $3.50 for the cup it's self.But anywaysJames Franco plays ""Oz"" and he plays him very well. They did a great job picking out the good witch (Michelle Williams) and the bad witches (Mila Kunis and Rachel Weisz). I think that the movie was especially amazing and fun to watch because of the chose of director, Sam Raimi. As movie starts, its hard not to pay attention to humor that only adults will get. The movie leads, like the classic, showing you exactly who the ""scarecrow, lion, and tinman"" are. When the plot gets to the reason that we all came to see, it becomes very apparent throughout who is who. I want to write much much more but I would much rather just persuade on with the reason I like this movie. The plot never goes off track and never is dull for a moment.

That being said, you can't compare it to the original movie. I am a great fan of ""The Wizard of Oz,"" but this is an entirely different series. That being said, however, doesn't mean that its not good... well, okay, its not good––it's great!The movie starts a little slow, but as things pick up, you get to know the main character ""Oswald (shortened to Oz), who is a stage magician with unsavory ethics.

287,MikeyBoomBoom,An average film ruined by Franco and Kunis,4,28 May 2013,"I'll keep this short.The movie was pretty average and the casting of Mila Kunis and James Franco was the nail in the coffin.Mila Kunis is just plain bad, wooden and awful in the role of Dizzydora or whatever. One of the worst performances I've seen. Really shockingly bad.Every time she opened her mouth I couldn't stop thinking ""Shut up Meg"".James Franco, as other reviewers have said, comes across as an unsympathetic, slightly creepy Oz. His performance is uneven to say the least. Over the top in some places, half asleep in others.Franco's ""likeable conman"" Oscar Diggs, entirely misses the mark, you won't hate him, but you won't give a crap what happens to him.The dialogue isn't strong, some of the visual effects are a bit dodgy and there are flaws in the direction.

288,kickbuttpotato,Less clever but a magical spectacle.,7,26 November 2013,"After Sam Raimi has successfully made his last horror picture Drag Me To Hell in 2009, and walking out in making a fourth Spider-Man film, he shifts in creating a mind-boggling colorful universe in ""Oz: The Great and Powerful"" based on the works of L. Frank Baum. Being unfamiliar with the story of the Wizard of Oz, though I'm hearing much of it back as a little boy, Raimi's movie gave me the impression that the story by Baum is akin to some of the fairy tales with a theme of good and evil. But the story of Oz is about trickery, better yet treachery of the bad ones. The movie starts with a 4:3 like aspect ratio, the kind you see in those old flat televisions before there was the widescreen, but we obviously won't be expecting it longer. Oz –played by James Franco– is a magician and a con man from Kansas. He seems to be the man that can perform magic but not miracles. There's a scene on his magic show where a girl believes that he can make her walk, but Oz doesn't know how to. This always meant that magicians could never do things in lieu of our faith. Oz is also the man for the ladies. After learning that one of his love Annie –played by Michelle Williams– becomes engaged to someone else, he's chased by one of his girls' goon beau and Oz was forced to set away with a hot air balloon. The balloon shifts from disaster after disaster before he sets his way to Oz, a colorful world and same as his name. How do I picture the place Oz? Think of Avatar or The Spiderwick Chronicles, you get the idea.In Oz, he meets Theodora the Good –played by Mila Kunis–, a witch where she tells 'the Oz' that there's a prophecy where the king of Oz will share the same name as from the man who will descend from the sky. As Oz descends in the world of Oz, he is regarded as the wizard who will save the people from The Wicked Witch –played also by Michelle Williams– who's rumored to be impossible to defeat.Theodora's sister Evanora –played by Rachel Weisz– tells Oz of the riches and the throne that will be rewarded to him if he successfully end the Wicked Witch's madness. Oz sets forth to the Dark Forest with the help of his flying monkey chauffeur Finley –voiced by Zach Braff– and a doll the China Girl –voiced by Joey King–. The only thing to end the villainy of the witch is to break her wand. I will leave the rest.Though the story isn't that much genuine nor brainy, I cared on how the story were crafted as a film. The narrative is less clever but not jarring. However, people prefers to be mystified by a movie to challenge them. Maybe that's how viewers want to be entertained nowadays. The film shares great 3D elements in creating the universe of Oz. It's enough to make the audiences experiencing the popping elements. In terms of sheer digital fulfillment, the film inevitably succeeds. Raimi has the reputation in picturing the world of Oz as rich in vivacity.I'm surprised to see that the make-up effects were helmed by Greg Nicotero and Howard Berger, the men behind the gory special effects from horror or suspense films. There's no good or bad with the way they did in the film. It's a good start for them to work something new in designing effects in motion pictures. Adding up the production values, it flawlessly compensate with the computer-generated effects. Nothing wrong with that.All the characters seems convincing enough. At least they weren't even pretentious for their respective parts. James Franco as Oz cares deeply for the role to be substantial than the narrative. Maybe Johnny Depp could also be a good Oz, but Franco is exact enough to collaborate with Sam Raimi since the Spider-Man films. I loved Michelle Williams playing two roles, but her Wicked Witch role is not too shabby. Rachel Weisz as the Evanora is flat in terms of villainy, and Mila Kunis does fit to be a little less villainy if possible. Tony Cox is also here as Knuck, though I'm a little surprised to see him in a friendly Disney movie role.By all means, Oz: The Great and Powerful hangs on the edge to be a passable entertainment from director Sam Raimi. With a runtime of 130 mins, it's never quite painful nor squirming in your seat.",Oz the Great and Powerful

But when you measure it up to the wonder and splendor of the original The Wizard of Oz, this film, well, it is totally dismal.There was a lot of colour. The CGI was okay- very cartoonish at times. The acting was so over the top, it became difficult to watch. Perhaps if I was a child who didn't know any better I might have taken a bit of a liking to this film.

Too harsh?",Oz the Great and Powerful
290,matsnowie,The weak and gimmicky,4,5 September 2013,"The great debate over 3D rages on, and Oz the Great and Powerful is the latest battleground. The critics are split; some say 3D should be innocuous and intended to build on quality storytelling, but some say that 3D should remember its roots as a 1950s novelty and throw things out of the screen. Oz falls into the second category with spears, flying monkeys, carnivorous trees, and bubbling fog all flying out to the audience. I decided to save a few bucks and went to the 2D, which may have been a mistake. From the animated credits it was clear that Sam Raimi was playing to the 3D crowd next door.The movie opens in black and white Kansas with the frame cut off at the old 4:3 ratio. Oz (James Franco) is a magician working in a travelling circus. He is selfish, deceitful, and as much of a womanizer as children's films allow. Plenty of great films have sleazy leading men who see the error of their ways, but this opening sequence is missing any kind of villain to contrast with the charming hero. When Rick first appears in Casablanca we like him not because he's a sharp-tongued rogue, but because he's a sharp-tongued rogue outwitting Nazis. Here, Franco is just the least honest man in a room of nice country people, and the intro sequence suffers as a result.When Oz's hot air balloon is tossed around by a tornado the visuals kick in. Broken fence posts stab at him through the floor and waggons crash into the screen as the noise rages on. Finally calm air returns and the screen transforms into panoramic colour. One thing that cannot be faulted is the film's production design. The look of the original 1939 film is recreated and expanded very effectively. Although the movie is claimed to be based on the books, it is clearly inspired most by the original musical.References to The Wizard of Oz imagery are everywhere. Rainbow arcs appear in clouds and tree branches through the whole film to the point of overkill. In one respect Raimi did hold back, which is referring to the original film's trio of characters. A lion makes a fun appearance, and we meet a man who makes scarecrows, but other than these little nods the film is mostly concerned with the love triangle (or square?) of Oz and the three witches.Michelle Williams is the bubble-powered Glinda, Rachel Weisz is the uncomplicated evil witch Evanora, and Mila Kunis is the naive Theodora. The relationships of these three with Oz appear a little one-sided, and are only marginally better than Twilight in terms of inspiring female role models. Also, since this is essentially a prequel, the original film's ending is given a depressing new twist with Oz abandoning Glinda to return to Kansas with a younger woman. But, all that aside, the three leading women are all great actors and they are performing in the slightly exaggerated style that classic Hollywood and children's films demand.When Glinda brings Oz into her protected kingdom there is a sequence where a bunch of townspeople explain exactly what they do; someone sews, someone makes bread, someone builds scarecrows, etc. Unfortunately this is not the only scene where people voluntarily say exactly what they do. The script is filled with exposition where characters simple state their intentions. If this weren't aimed at children I'd say it was criminally lazy writing, but I have to remind myself again that this is targeted at kids who have recently hit the age where The Wizard of Oz is first experienced. Clarity is expected.Without the dazzle of 3D I was left to look at the quality of the story, the script, and the acting, none of which are the film's strength. It's worth looking at for the visuals of the production design. I wouldn't say that it is a terrible otherwise, since it easily outdoes other re-visitations of children's classics (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory comes to mind), but it isn't great, and unless you're under 10 it isn't powerful.http://charlieposts.blogspot.ca/2013/03/oz-great-and-powerful.html",Oz the Great and Powerful
291,bjhomeboy08,Simply an amazing theater experience,9,18 March 2013,"Note* This movie was seen in 3D.""Oz the Great and Powerful"" is a magical film that truly encompasses the theater experiences. You'll immediately notice the superb visuals, outstanding orchestral score, and the top-notch production for this film. All the actors deliver stellar performances (it must be noted that if you're not a James Franco fan at all then you might not enjoy this movie as much) and Sam Raimi really puts his mark on this film. You'll immediately recognize a lot of the same camera shots and tricks that Raimi likes to use and it works extremely well for this film. When there's tension, you feel it, when there's scenes of grief you feel compassion for the characters, and when the movie reaches it's climatic end you'll feel satisfied. I give credit to the Disney production studio for respecting the source material. The last few films to come from Disney have been remarkably disappointing, but ""Oz"" seems to have saved not only the city of Oz but the Disney studio as well. Also the 3D definitely enhanced the experience. So if you're willing to shell out the extra cash then don't hesitate to do so.",Oz the Great and Powerful
292,theoctobercountry,"Not great, but not bad overall",7,9 March 2013,"This afternoon I went to see ""Oz the Great and Powerful."" Hey---a new theatrical interpretation of Oz, how could I possibly resist?I've noted previously that the 1939 Oz film had a tremendous impact on me as a child, and influenced me throughout my life. (For instance---I daresay the influence of the film is one of the reasons I've always been partial to the poppy flower. And in fact at this very moment I'm working on a stained glass lampshade featuring a poppy design---over four decades after I first saw this film.)How does this new trip through Oz compare? Well, it doesn't---but I hardly expected it to be in the same league as the iconic 74-year-old film. However, while flawed I thought in the end it proves to be an entertaining entry on the list of Oz adaptations---not as good as some of the others, but far better than many of the lesser offerings.I am not well acquainted with James Franco's body of work, so I had no expectations going in on how he would play the role. I'm afraid my primary impression of this actor was a negative one, based almost entirely on his bizarre and disastrous turn in hosting the Oscars a couple of years ago. (If he wasn't drunk or high on that job---then what on earth was he thinking?) But---I think he does a decent job here with the character. Oh, perhaps he could have used a bit more bluster and bravado---a dash of Robert Preston's Professor Hill from ""The Music Man."" But overall, his interpretation worked for me.Unfortunately, one of the other primary casting choices was disastrous. Mila Kunis didn't work AT ALL for me as the Wicked Witch of the West; I just didn't buy it. Her transformation to this evil creature was underdeveloped, though this was primarily due to problems with the script, which shortchanged both the set-up and payoff. But I didn't find her voice, or physical appearance, or general demeanor convincing in the least. And this is such an iconic character, that the weak link is problematic for the film overall.The script was okay but rather by-the-numbers; I thought the story dragged a bit in the central portion (the film clocks in at around 130 minutes), though things livened up considerably during the final half- hour as the battles between the witches got underway. I think the main problem with the film is that it's lovely to look at, and fairly imaginative, but it has no genuine heart or soul. The audience isn't really given any character to root for, to identify with, and as a result our emotional involvement and attachment to what is happening on- screen is muted at best.I'm sorry to say that I didn't find the scoring to be particularly memorable, which is a shame because first-rate orchestrations could have greatly enhanced the viewing experience. And it was a real shame that no elements directly related to the 1939 film were included in this production. (Due to copyright restrictions, only Baum's original book series---now in public domain---were used for inspiration.) For instance, the presence of the ruby slippers could have provided some key plot points---I've already thought of interesting ways they could have been incorporated into the story. And frankly, I just don't see why the producers of this film didn't secure the rights to use some of the elements from the classic film, because such a thing has been done before in previous Oz adaptations. It makes no sense whatsoever to me.All that said, I did enjoy the film---don't regret going to see it---and found it a pleasant diversion overall. It very well may be one I'll buy when the blu-ray becomes available. I don't think it will leave any lasting or particularly memorable impression in today's pop culture, but it's a respectable enough entry to the world of Oz. I'm hoping that this film performs well, because if it does turn a profit it will make the possibility of further Oz projects that much more likely. (Though it does have a job cut out for it---it will probably have to make over 400 million (USD) world-wide before it breaks even. I'm going to follow the box office most carefully and see how it does.)Oh, an addendum---for those who are curious, I would say this film is moderately family-friendly. Now, I wouldn't take toddlers to see it or anything---too scary for the very young---but it was much less intense than I had been anticipating. I suppose I had been thinking that it would have a bit more ""mature"" content. In fact, this film is fairly light in comparison to 1985's ""Return to Oz,"" which has a much darker, more adult tone. Now, while that film was a failure at the box office, it is one of which I am very fond, and which does have a cult following to this day. If ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" puts you in an Ozian sort of mood, by all means don't forget to check out ""Return to Oz"" in turn!",Oz the Great and Powerful
293,tsbarry,Only the last 15 minutes were worth watching.,1,3 April 2013,"I have to take exception with the reviews on IMDb anymore. It almost seems as if people are paid to give glowing reviews for lame movies. The same thing was true of the movie ""Drive"".Take this movie for example with a current rating of 6.9. I mean, really?I would have walked out of this movie within the first 15 minutes had I not been with two other people but after the movie I learned that they too would have done the same because it was just that bad. And upon exiting there was a resounding lack of enthusiasm from the other patrons in attendance. The story was weak and the acting even weaker. I really liked all of the cast and had high hopes for the movie but what a big let down. Other than the last 15 minutes the rest of it was just a lot of computer generated crap with the usual Hollywood character redeeming them self. Just very disappointing.",Oz the Great and Powerful

295,xenoraiser,Too Many Tricks Without Heft,5,11 March 2013,"Few films have enjoyed as much recognition and popularity throughout  history as The Wizard of Oz. Even with a notable group of naysayers,  the 1939 release is still regarded as a classic and mandatory viewing  for anybody. Needless to say, any sort of follow-up would pretty much  be set up for disappointment, and in 1985 the Return to Oz didn't leave  too much of an impact. At least, not in the long run. It's probably  even of less surprise then, that a prequel of sorts released this year  will suffer the same fate.  Things start well enough with the eye-catching opening credits and a  classic, black-and- white look as we're introduced to James Franco's  Oz. While it isn't entirely clear at first, his Oz is actually a tough  character to get behind. We know from the trailers that he's an  everyday magician and essentially becomes a conman when he arrives in  Oz. The problem isn't that he's a liar, but that he oftentimes basks in  his own ego, exudes a sort of snobbiness and a general lack of concern.  This isn't just a concern in the opening act, it stretches throughout  the entire film. He almost comes off like an anti-hero, but this isn't  in-line with how his character is necessarily supposed to come off.  There's just a lack of sympathy due to his general lack of sympathy  (with a couple exceptions).  Another problem arises literally right when Oz lands in, well, Oz: Oz  itself. If you want to know the final word on how Oz looks and feels,  it's colorful but artificial. If nothing else, Oz should be a bit of a  visual spectacle, but it's a little tough to feel brought in when so  much is clearly CGI. There are actual sets and everything isn't as  abused as, say, the Star Wars prequels, but throughout the movie I was  saying ""this is to The Wizard of Oz what the prequels are to Star  Wars.""  Now, I'm not one who decries every little aspects of the Star Wars  prequels. Likewise, I wouldn't say Oz the Great and Powerful is devoid  of good points. The first 20 minutes are a solid way to start the film;  it's nostalgic, a good touch base with the characters and again, we get  nice opening credits. One of the characters, a porcelain doll, is a  clear highlight of the film and probably the closest it comes to actual  emotion. I mentioned above how Oz's character left me with a cold  shoulder save for a few parts; his interactions with the doll comprised  most of those.  But even when talking about what worked well, it's so easy to get back  to what doesn't work. Both Mila Kunis and Rachel Weisz feel like they  were written off for silliness and, if not that, then the costume  design, make up and effects accomplish just that. There are also some  sharp plot holes when taking The Wizard of Oz into account, ranging  from details such as why the characters are written the way they are,  to the actual existence of the story itself. There's potential to  explain this in a sequel, but that'll be a tough bridge to connect.  Oz the Great and Powerful has a few neat ideas in place, but ultimately  stumbles with inconsistencies as abundant as its own color spectrum.  Even the potentially invigorating moments merely instill a sense of  superficiality. Oz has a small assortment of tricks up his sleeve, but  only a couple of them are actually pulled off.",Oz the Great and Powerful
296,thaibm,Beautiful romance,8,23 March 2013,"As a rookie to the franchise of Oz,I find the rendition this year very exciting and in the genre of romantic adventure rather than a family, kid type. The acting by the main actor and both female leads are at the top, especially Michelle Wiliam. Michelle really turns the little flick into her own love story. She was never a princess typecast but in her debut in the role she redefines how a princess should be. She is just so lovely and sexy at the same time. You would be amazed to see how she could be so versatile in her acting and portrayal of character. I was in love with Michelle ever since Dawson's Creek, admire her excellence performance in Blue Valentine and now a nice surprise in the Oz. Haven't watched the classic one yet, but could affirmatively believe this one would not be any less entertaining",Oz the Great and Powerful
297,Normanholic,"Family's will love it, critics will hate it",6,22 April 2013,"To start off, I haven't seen this for over a month, so this review might be a little shaky. Oz the Great and Powerful has a cast of A-list actors, so you'd expect great acting, right? Well, I'm sorry to say, what you expected is not what you get. Franco as the starring role is just a disaster. The only scene of the film that I consider to have good acting from Franco is where he finds the china doll girl. Other than that his lines are delivered in a cheesy manner, especially his "" I don't want to be a good man... I want to be a great one!"" And I'm not trying to say Franco is a terrible actor or anything, it's just that this film did not suit him well. I've seen other roles of his and he's great! And you also can't blame all of it on the actors, you also have to blame the writers, but I'll talk about that later... Now for Kunis. WHAT HAPPENED?! Kunis is an amazing actress, her role in Black Swan is amazing and definitely testify's to her acting ability, but again, like Franco, this film did not suit her well. I believe she was overacting as the nice witch. It was just a poor job. It's a shame too, since she is such a good actress! I believe she did better as the evil witch, but not by much. The rest of the cast didn't do a terrible job. It just wasn't very good. Michelle Williams' role as Glinda was probably the best acting in this, but still not that great. Also something I hated about this film. The little black dude! I don't want to sound racist, 'cause I'm not. But that character was awful. I've seen similar characters in other movies and they worked SO MUCH better than this guy. I knew he was a character who you were supposed to enjoy and find him hilarious, but I just didn't. He felt so thrown in at the last minute and not given a lot of thought. The character just seemed awkward to me. But that's just my opinion. This film has an explosion of cheesy overdone lines of dialogue. It's a real shame because they could have made something marvelous. Instead, they hire crappy writers and hire actors who don't do well in children's movies. OK, I sound harsh, the writing wasn't AWFUL. It just had a lot of cheesy lines. OK, now onto the good stuff about this movie! The visuals! Oh, the visuals! It's like a feast to the eye. So beautiful it almost makes up from the acting and writing! The 3D is wonderful as- well. I say if you're going to see this movie, see it in 3D. You will NOT be disappointed by the 3D. I think this could receive an Oscar nomination for best CGI. Another good thing about this movie is the monkey and the china doll. Kinda sad that the animated characters are your favorite but I really liked the china doll. She had a sweet spirit. I really enjoyed the scenes with her.Well, I guess that is all I have to say. Thank you for reading!",Oz the Great and Powerful
298,aag189,Outstanding movie regardless of of the fact Mila Kunis almost killed it,8,8 April 2013,I am ranking this an 8 because Mila Kunis' acting knocked it down 2 stars. If it wasn't for her this could have been a 10 star movie.. so sad.First off the original movie blows this one away but this film is still a must see for a fan of anything to do with Oz. Warning this review has spoilers.James Franco plays the title role and does a great job. Some people complain that he wasn't likable but that was the whole point of his character because he is a con-man. A con man that charms you then double-crosses you. But he evolves in the movie and it shows. He is such an underrated actor.The land of Oz is well done. I am not a big fan of CGI and more than not CGI never impresses me but it was well done here. Frankly the land of Oz in this movie looked too much like Burton's Wonderland (a movie that sucked). I wish whoever designed it had more imagination.Rachel Weisz did a good job as one of the witches but it was Michelle Williams' Glenda that stoled the show. She play it spot on and the goodness of the good which just oozes out of her. Hats off totally. I think I'm in love. She must studied the original movie and took notes because she pulled off the role and then some. Needless to say I will be keeping an eye out for Michelle Williams in the future.Now time to talk about the ugly part of this movie Mila Kunis. Her acting was just plain bad. She pretty much played Mila Kunis playing Mila Kunis playing Mila Kunis dressed as a witch. I never realized how bad of an actress she was because in the things I have seen her in she always plays the same role which is Mila Kunis playing Mila Kunis. This time around she had to play the wicked witch and it was just painful to watch. I think the director was trying to hide it from us because most of the frames that show her just have her just sitting or standing and not doing anything because her acting was bad enough to take you out of the movie. So sad.Other than Mila Kunis this movie was awesome. A must see! I just hope they replace her in or when they do a sequel because if she is in it I will not watch it in the theaters no matter how good it looks. I'm sure they'll replace her. They'll have to replace her or else no one will watch it.,Oz the Great and Powerful
299,rocketXpert,I liked it.,7,14 March 2013,"Greetings from July, 2017. I wrote this review right after Oz the Great and Powerful came out, and now that a few years have passed and I can see a bit more clearly, I'm more than a little embarrassed at my effusive praise of this film. I haven't seen the movie since it was in theaters. I think I'd still enjoy it today, but I'd also find it easier to admit that it's not that great. I like Franco and Kunis, but they weren't the best choices for these roles. Also, it's disappointing that Disney felt the urge to make this an unofficial prequel to the 39 movie rather than basing the story more on the books. I thought about deleting my review entirely, but for the time being, I think I'll just leave it the way it is with the addition of this admission that I'm now able to confess that perhaps I don't love it as much as I originally thought I did. After this paragraph, what follows is my original review: I feel a bit sorry for L. Frank Baum. In his lifetime he wrote fourteen Oz books- in terms of popularity, they were essentially the Harry Potter series of the early 20th century- however, nowadays, if you ask the average person on the street about Oz, the first and only thing that will come to mind will be the 1939 classic film- a film that is not even entirely faithful to the source material, I might add. I love that movie as much as the next person, but there's so much more to Oz than Judy Garland and ruby slippers.Anybody who dares to tackle Oz as a subject faces an uphill battle, fighting against the general public's cherished memories of what is erroneously believed to be the one true version of that story. In an even broader sense, any movie made today must endure an increasingly jaded and judgmental movie-going public.I confess I had my own doubts about this film, but those were abolished from the stylish opening credits onwards. I hasten to add that if I watch a movie based on a property I've loved in the past and it fails to meet my expectations, I won't delude myself into thinking it was good when it wasn't, nor will I be afraid to say that I was disappointed. I'm very happy that I don't have to do that in this case. ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" has heart and humor in abundance, and it is also a treat for the eyes, to coin a phrase. I tend to dismiss 3D as a gimmicky fad, yet was quite impressed by its employment here.It's not a perfect movie (what is?). In all honesty, I've probably given it a slightly higher score than it merits, but in to be fair, there are also those who have given it a far lower score than it deserves. Anyone who gives this film a single star should check out the 1969 kiddie matinée version of ""The Marvelous Land of Oz"" or last year's ""The Witches of Oz"" if they want to see what a truly dismal Oz movie really looks like.The part where the movie fell a bit flat for me was the ""woman scorned"" plot element. I've no dispute with this film's explanation for how the Wicked Witch became wicked, but it was I couldn't help feeling a trifle bored by clichéd manner that storyline was executed. I hate myself for it, but while listening to the fairly hackneyed dialogue between Evanora and Theadora, for the briefest of moments, I found myself almost wishing that I was watching a ""Wicked"" film instead.Each member of the cast did a fine job in my book, but I'd be remiss if I didn't mention my favorite character of the movie: China Girl. No one but the most hard-hearted of cynics could fail to be charmed and moved by that character. I could easily see China Girl having a career extending beyond this film the way Jiminy Cricket and Tinkerbell have had in the past.Life seems so unrelentingly stressful these days that escapism is more vital than ever, but in my case, the cinema doesn't always provide as much of a refuge from the outside world as it once did. Often as I'm sitting watching a film, no matter how good it may be, the weight of my troubles will come crashing down on me and I have to fight the urge to bolt from the theater screaming. However, I managed to spend two hours completely captivated by ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" without my problems intruding on my mind once. It may not mean much to everyone, but by those standards alone, I'd consider this movie a roaring success.",Oz the Great and Powerful
300,james-726-893190,It stayed as it is,8,23 August 2013,"I think the movie was successful because it stuck to the original's capacity of imagination. It wasn't exaggerated and nothing over-the-top was added, instead it felt like the old Oz, it felt silly in a good way, it was colorful, it was childish and it was easy and pleasing to watch. Especially by the end, I felt like I was brought back to my child form, it was so nostalgic!! (the last 3 minutes), the music was really good too. James Franco as the cowardly witty Oz was suitable, I can imagine myself sketching him as Oz. Kunis as Theodora was cool too, but somehow her voice was softer than ugly and scary. Other than that, the movie wasn't so bad. I'd recommend all to watch it, but with modest expectations, nothing over-the-top either :)",Oz the Great and Powerful

It's definitely not a gritty film, but what it lacks in being a methodical, realistic movie it makes up for in charm, exuberance, and genuine care for the story.

Michelle Williams may have been the best performance, but it doesn't hold a bubble to the Good witch Glinda in the original. The special effects are better, but that's not enough to win us over.

304,hbenthow,The tale of how the Wizard came to be.,9,13 March 2013,"For those who don't know (and disregarded the spoiler warning anyway) ""Oz the Great and Powerful is a 2013 Disney movie, directed by Sam Raimi, which tells the story of carnival magician Oscar Zoroaster Phadrig Isaac Norman Henkel Emmannuel Ambroise Diggs (whose friends call him Oz for short), who, upon fleeing his carnival in a hot-air balloon to escape the strongman husband of one of his illicit lovers, is whisked away by a tornado to a land, which whether by coincidence or design, is also called Oz. There, he embarks upon a grand adventure which leads to him becoming the legendary Wonderful Wizard of Oz, and a better man to boot. I thought James Franco was good in the title role. Could someone else have played the part better? Possibly. But he wasn't anywhere near bad, and it's refreshing to see someone other than Johnny Depp getting the lead role in this type of movie. The role of a conniving carnival magician fits Franco like a glove, and he had just the right balance of smarminess and likability. Mila Kunis was very good as Theodora before and during her transformation, but afterward......not so much. She had the laugh down pat, but her screaming and facial expressions were more awkward than scary. It seems as if the Wicked Witch of the West was somewhat out of her acting range. She was perfect as the naive Theodora, and is most likely good at playing evil characters who are subtly creepy. But as a hyperactive witch who screams every line at the top of her lungs, she seems embarrassingly out her element. Her shouting just isn't very scary. It's like the Wicked Witch equivalent of Christian Bale's Batman voice (not in sound, but in effect). Her makeup didn't do her any favors, either. There was some fear that if her makeup was too scary, it would frighten children. So, changes were made to tone down the creepiness. The result looks like nothing more or less than a green Mila Kunis with arched eyebrows. In still pictures, she actually looks impressive. The arched eyebrows and green contact lenses give her a subtle creepiness. But in motion, the eyebrows look stiff and inexpressive, the contact lenses don't make much of an impact one way or the other, and the overall minimalistic approach to the makeup doesn't work nearly as well for the pretty Mila Kunis as it did for crone-like Margaret Hamilton. The makeup also seems to be hindering her facial expressions, as she looks as if she's acting with only her mouth and part of her face near her nose. Fortunately, Rachel Weisz was there to save the day. She portrayed Evanora with the kind of larger than life, deliciously evil zest that you rarely see these days. In fact, I'd so so far as to say that her performance turned Evanora into one of the best villainesses in Disney history. And since Evanora was the main antagonist of the movie, she managed to take a lot of the sting out of the disappointment caused by the lackluster portrayal of the Wicked Witch of the West. Interestingly, when Evanora becomes a wrinkled hag at the end, her makeup is very impressive. Why didn't they have the sense to make Mila Kunis' makeup that good? Much of the rest of the cast was great as well. Michelle Williams did Glinda more than justice. She brought the character to life with a wonderfully sincere sweetness, and never came across as sappy. China Girl was a scene-stealer. The effects used to create her were so good that she looked like she was made of real china. Her mannerisms and facial expressions were equally impressive, and the voice acting by Joey King (who was also great as the corresponding wheelchair girl character) was even better. I was afraid that Finley (voiced by Zach Braff) would be annoying, but he was actually pretty good. Knuck (played by Tony Cox) was pretty annoying, though. He was less an actual character than he was shtick manifested in human form. Mercifully, he didn't have much screen time.Director Sam Raimi brought a great sense of style to the movie. From the creative opening titles sequence onward, ""Oz The Great and Powerful"" is full of stylistic flair, plenty of heart, and just enough brains to make it all come together beautifully.The Technicolor-inspired color palette and production design are eye-popping. While there is indeed a ton of CGI, there were, in total, nearly 30 actual sets built for the movie. This brings a refreshing sense of realness to many scenes. For example, when China Girl begs Oz to let her come along on his witch hunt, the Yellow Brick Road, the stalks of corn, and the wooden sign are all real. Only China Girl, Finley, and the sky are CGI. A few scenes had no CGI whatsoever. And even in the CGI-heavy scenes, the foreground is almost always a practical set. As a result, there aren't any moments where the actors look as if they are confused as to where they are or what is in front of them. They always seem perfectly integrated into the world, because they were rarely ever in an empty blue-screen room.Danny Elfman's score is excellent. From the eerily beautiful theme used for the music box and Theodora's waltz, to the Wizard's fanfare, memorable melodies abound.As a whole, I find ""Oz The Great and Powerful"" very enjoyable. While the Wicked Witch of the West is disappointing and a few bits of humor come across as annoying, the other elements of the movie more than make up for it. It has a great sense of fun, is sometimes surprisingly touching, and unlike ""Alice in Wonderland"" (2010), has a story that, although simple and a bit silly (and what Oz story has not been a little silly), works well.",Oz the Great and Powerful

Unfortunately, their efforts are almost torpedoed thanks to a bland script that needed a lot more heart and the shocking miscasting of two of its major roles.First we should start with the look of the film, which is to my surprised tame considering the gluttony of CGI in today's films. Sam Raimi gives an old school feel to this film that manages to balance the right tone of epic nostalgia and childlike intimacy with a hint of Raimi's signature manic style of energy. It is a beautiful film to look at and it is very inviting. The character's looks all represent their personalities and the CGI animated effects for the imaginary characters match the feel and look of the film. From the childlike wonder of China Doll to the scary fanged flying baboon, Raimi manages to let them connect on a visual level with their environment and not for once that they over power the seamless look of the film. It is a beautiful, visual affair and that is all thanks to the grace that Sam Raimi and his ability to let the audiences feel their way around this beautiful world. Unfortunately, while this movie is beautiful to look at, not even Raimi's efforts are enough to cover over the fact that the movie's script is as bland as a stale cracker and some of the performances are just flat out bad. The story lacks punch and its barley passable as a narrative. The character's motives are flimsy at best and a hint of irony and complexity could have added a lot more to the film. It is only through the efforts of the movie's best actors (Rachel Weisz and Michele Williams) that give this film the fun, irony and complexity that the script does not manage to even give itself. Unfortunately, while Weisz and Williams are bring more than humanly possible to their perspective roles, both James Franco and Mila Kunis look like they rather not be there are all. The bad part is that both Franco and Kunis are so miscast that it makes you question the mentality of the casting agent who though that they were good choices for their roles.This leads me to the acting of this film, which is disjointed to say the least. James Franco has done good work in past films but here he just looks like he just does not care about his fellow actors or his performance. He looks like someone who just wants to cash a check and just cost by on what little he can do. He lacks charisma, charm and presence in the role of Oscar Diggs and the bad part is that he is the movie's lead character. Franco's attitude is well displayed on screen and it hurts the film and you end up wondering on why he was even cast in the first place. The same goes to Mila Kunis, who tries a bit harder than Franco on her performance but ends up almost as bad. She just does not have it in her to pull off the role of Theodora, who becomes the Wicked Witch of the West and her performance on screen shows that she is well aware of that. Therefore, she just gives up half way and leaves both Weisz and Williams to fend for themselves. This is not a bad thing when you think about it because both of them manage to hold the film above water while the script just falls flat, Franco continues to not care about anyone but himself and Kunis just does not bother.This leads me to the best parts of the movie, which are the performances of Rachel Weisz and Michelle Williams, who both should get overtime pay for keeping the film from self-destructing. Both actresses are probably the best we have working today and in this film, it shows. Weisz plays the oldest sister Evanora, who is the villain of the film and let me tell you, she is so much fun that its criminal and her performance is the best of the film. She gives the character of Evanora such a sassy, fun presence that you do not need Kunis to transform into the Wicked Witch of the west to get a charge, because Weisz does more with less and gets the job done. Her performance keeps the movie afloat and the viewer is more than happy to follow her, which is strange because she is the villain of the film and has more charisma and charm that the hero himself. The second best is Michelle Williams who plays Gilda, the good witch and manages to keep her character from going way too far with the sweetness and have a bit of an edge as well. Williams brings humanity to her performance and the film and gives a perfect foil to Weisz's evil Evanora. If Disney had any sense, a sequel or prequel to this film would have just both Weisz and Williams and leave out Franco and Kunis but I seriously doubt it.You should follow this yellow brick road just to see Sam Raimi give his all to this beautiful world and see on how good actors Rachel Weisz and Michelle Williams are in their roles but this road has potholes (Which are the script and the performances of James Franco and Mila Kunis) that cannot be avoided. Let's just hope you have good wheels to go around them to get to the good this film has to offer.",Oz the Great and Powerful
307,buchhol2,"Fun Visuals, A Passable Amount of Magic and One Terrible Performance",5,22 April 2013,"The Wizard of Oz is one of the most magical films of all time and no film that carries the Oz name will ever match it's whimsy. That being said, Oz the Great and Powerful does a serviceable job of transporting us to a place we've only dreamed of going. The visuals are beautiful and I can imagine many children in awe of some of the images on screen. Some of the effects are a bit sugarymbut for the most part they are consistently interesting to look it. James Franco does a fine job of portraying Oz, Rachel Weisz is great as the conniving Evanora and Michelle Williams gives an almost boringly pleasant performance as Glinda. That leaves one performance left, and that's Mila Kunis' awful portrayal of Theodora. The wicked witch is one of the defining characters of Oz and when portrayed with such little menace and verve, it's enough to ruin the entire experience.",Oz the Great and Powerful
308,madmrox,What a mess this was!!!,1,1 December 2013,"Where to begin? Okay, to start with James Franco cannot act to save his life! This movie has ruined any kind of reputation he got for 127 Hours, that is just the start of the catastrophe that this movie ended up being. Mila Kunis played one of the most unlikeable and unrelatable villain character in movie history.Moving onto the horrible CGI in this film. It started colorful and stunning to look at and ended up so unrealistic and repetitive that it became almost impossible to watch. I found myself confused by the CGI and the scene with the fake flower field in the background from the original 1939 classic. I ended up feeling as though the CGI was a obvious cover up for the bland, dull characters that we were supposed to enjoy watching and the story that took us no where original.Overall, I feel that it would have made for a more interesting film if the prequel was about Dorothy growing up on a farm in Kansas. Disney should not have gone anywhere near this classic story. If you eliminate James Franco, Mila Kunis, the CGI, the teapot girl, the 'good' monkey, the director, the script, Disney and any cameras it would be a perfect film (so nothing). I am disappointed that I spent over 2 hours of my life watching this horrible movie.",Oz the Great and Powerful
309,bfd21552,Poor Writing Will Out!,1,17 October 2013,"Such total reliance upon CGI effects will ""date"" late (1970's+) twentieth- and early-twenty-first century films . . . much as bad singing ""dates"" the studio-system films of the late 1930's and late 1940's Let's face it, neither Mickey Rooney nor James Stewart were singers--nor Lee Marvin, either--(OK, OK, ""Paint Your Wagon"" is late 1960's).""Oz . . ."" fails because it is horribly written (period). Either the actor in the male lead (who picks up diplomas like celluloid pennies from heaven) had NO SAY about the storyline or dialogue . . . or we've ALL been MOONED (and I don't mean as in ""George lassoes the moon""!)",Oz the Great and Powerful
310,mvd102000,"The Good, The Bad, & The Ugly",6,19 March 2013,"Well, let's start with... The Good:The visual effects are 2nd to none. Raimi and his team have given their audience a bright and colorful world of wonder in a much more 'wowing' Land of Oz than that of the original film, and possibly even one that's more visually attractive than any other film to date. A very fun and crafty Rachel Weisz takes the role of Evanora and grips the audience with charm and viciousness in all the right doses. The supporting cast also performs pretty well, sometimes capturing that original 'Wizard of Oz' magic.The Bad: Going into this film with high expectations for the dialogue, & acting is going to leave you very disappointed. Two of the most featured roles of the film, Oz (played by James Franco) & Theodora, (played by Mila Kunis) are surprisingly and inexcusably portrayed very poorly. Franco's Oz is written to be about how you would expect him to be - complete with charm, wit, & deceit. However, the depth that you would expect to come with such an anticipated resurgence of a character is missing, & you can tell that Franco is having trouble buying into the role himself. The character quickly becomes stale at about 45 minutes in, and doesn't ever fully recover. Kunis feels the same - bored & devoid of passion for the lackluster lines given to her. Her character also has an issue with development, and is rushed from high to low so quickly that the audience doesn't have the opportunity to invest in her. The performances aren't the worst thing you'll ever see, but the lifeless script & awkward dialogue make it hard to stay focused. Even with a great script though, I feel as though Franco & Kunis weren't the best choices for their respective roles. The Ugly: The worst part of this movie is the story. It leaves you waiting for some kind of clever & unexpected plot twist, a little divulgence of the characters motivations, or even just some depth for the main focal points of the story. It's also somewhat obnoxious that this film takes elements of the original film that should have been left alone because the original film portrays Dorothy's entire journey as a dream in the end. (Such as transferring characters of ""the real world"" into characters of The Land of Oz) Without saying too much, I can tell you that this film is stuck somewhere between being a fun and family friendly revitalization of the original story and being a serious and intriguing fantasy film for a wide movie-going audience - and the formula just doesn't work. Having said all of that, I do not regret having gone to see Oz: The Great and Powerful, as the visuals do a great job of making up for everything that didn't work. I will warn you though, that the films run time of just over two hours can be difficult to sit through at times. Don't be afraid to take a bathroom break when it gets dry, you probably won't miss too much.",Oz the Great and Powerful
311,dacookielad,This had so much potential!,5,1 April 2013,"Oz the great and the powerful is a sequel/reboot of the popular Oz series. It stars James Franco, Mila Kunis, Michelle Williams and Zach Braff. The beginning of the film was pretty well done and unique. James Franco plays a struggling magician known as 'Oz, The Great and Powerful' who is hung up on a girl whom is getting married. Oz gets caught into a tornado on his hot air balloon, then enters the world of Oz and our story begins. I loved the fact that they made it black and white in the beginning then everything turned into color when he entered the world of Oz. For me this was what really caught my eye when I was watching this film.The film starts out pretty well done, the acting was decent throughout most of the first 10-20 minutes...but then as the movie progresses I find that the film begins to get worse than worse rather than getting better and better. The character development was pretty decent at first but then all of a sudden it seemed as if they just dropped all character development and in fact it almost seemed as if they were running out of time!The acting starts to get so cheesy it actually made me put my head down in disappointment. This was the same guy who was in 127 hours and Spider-Man, and such acting was remarkable in my opinion, but in this movie his acting was just not good. Mila Kunis didn't do any better, and in fact the best acting throughout the film was Michelle Williams. We didn't get to see too much of Zach Braff since most of his 'screen time' was voicing an animated monkey.The flamboyant characters with all of their costumes from the original were gone and it really seemed as if 90% of the cast were animated characters which really got on my nerves. It's fine if a few of the major characters would be CGI but did you really have to have James Franco running around in front of a green screen talking to invisible people? I understand that it's cheaper and easier to do but in my opinion it really would have kept my attention if there was a guy in a fantastic makeup job to be skipping along with James Franco and the rest of the 'gang'.The villain was nothing more than a misunderstood character who I had hoped would be 'redeemed' towards the end and decide to help Oz but they didn't. I won't go into detail about it but let's just say that this villain was nothing more than someone who was misguided and betrayed by our so-called 'hero'. Now Sam Raimi is NOT a bad director at all, this film didn't change my opinion on him. The same thing goes for the rest of the cast because they all know how to make a movie which is why I'm scratching my head as to why this movie ended up like this. Maybe it was the writing, but that still wouldn't explain the horrendous acting. I tried to figure out what kind of meaningful message this film could have towards kids but in actuality it just seemed as if the writer was in such a big rush that he decided to say ""Screw it"" and wrote it within a week. I truly hope this won't get a sequel because the last thing we need is another ""CGI"" nightmare. Oh and also, don't tell me that makeup jobs are outdated because if Harry Potter can make Goblins with solely only makeup then I'm pretty damn sure this movie could have been just as creative, or perhaps even more creative!",Oz the Great and Powerful
312,mjturny23,Oz: The Great and Powerful review and critique,9,15 March 2013,"For the full review and critique, go to http://mydreamtank.co.uk/ As a fan of the original, I was very excited for a new Oz movie. Both Sam Raimi and James Franco seem like left field choices for me as the director and star of Oz: The Great and Powerful, but they both deliver on expectations and so much more through their own personal weird cameras. When Franco first enters Oz it is a magical adventure with a slightly cartoonish feel, a world of china dolls and pixies with sharp teeth. And the adventure doesn't slow down for a moment, mixing all the right ingredients that made the Wizard of Oz such a magnificent film, but with less constraint on the visuals. Expect a sequel as all of the cast are signed on but Sam Raimi probably won't return.",Oz the Great and Powerful
313,nathansmithba,Absolutely meaningless,2,22 March 2013,"I will not ""wax lyrical"" about this picture as its so poor I have no motivation to do so. However, i am motivated to pen this review for those poor souls who experience it.Oz is terrible, granted following up on original is almost impossible task but if one undertakes then at least write a good story and assemble descent cast - all failed on this project. Franco has his charm but not gravitas to carry off lead role. I have read many reviews about Kunis but she was probably as bored in the film as I was so forgiven - for record - she hasn't done anything to note anyway (Black Swan but was being directed by Aaronofsky).This is a picture which uses name to generate box office but leads you no where other than the exit with huge relieve.",Oz the Great and Powerful
314,ryguy815,Not bad but not very good either,5,27 April 2013,"The title of this review pretty much sums up my opinion on this movie. It's not a horrible movie, it's just not all that good. Oz: The Great And Powerful is about Oscar Diggs (played by James Franco), a man who must try to save the city of Oz from the wicked witch of the west. The movie just isn't all that interesting for the most part and it is honestly quite childish at times. But it's a kids movie so it's expected that it would be childish. The performances from James Franco and Michelle Williams were both good. Mila Kunis was pretty good for maybe her first five minutes on screen but she quickly turned annoying. She got even worse when she became the wicked witch of the west. Rachel Weisz was pretty bad throughout. The 3D in the movie was pretty good but that's no reason to rush out and see it. If you want to see this movie, go see it I guess. Just don't expect very much from it.",Oz the Great and Powerful
315,willworkman,Worthy Addition to the Oz Franchise,6,24 March 2013,"Maybe I just set the bar a little low, but this movie was surprisingly watchable. It gives Oz a character and background that fits well with the humbug we know from the 1939 film. It shows respect for Baum's original material, even making an endearing character out of one of Baum's sillier ideas (people made of china). The story resists going too dark and modern; the plot and characters would have been perfectly at home in the 1940s. The land of Oz plays on the nice amped-up color of the original and visual jokes in the form of plant-animal hybrids--like Avatar but without the ponderous length. In fact, it feels more like 90 minutes than 130. There were two weaknesses. One was the CGI, which was sometimes annoying. Must every stone bridge stand for 1000 years, only to crumble as the heroes run across it. Must the monsters rush at you with generic fangs? Must the camera always be in motion? Someday directors will be over their infatuation with CGI and give our eyes some resting points. But not today, and not Sam Raimee. The bigger weakness was the acting. None of the actors have quite enough weight for their parts. Franco strikes the same smirky note throughout, Mila Kunis can't quite pull of the crazy vengeful girlfriend, and even Rachel Weicz is hard to believe. But these are quibbles in a simple, enjoyable film.",Oz the Great and Powerful
316,inessa_maria,More than powerful? yes or no...,10,30 August 2013,"The idea of shooting Oz the Great and Powerful can be awkward or unnecessary. Believe me, it was my first thought. The Wizard of Oz is the most amazing movie I have ever seen in my entire life, I have been falling in love with it since I was 6 years old. It has been 29 years of pure love. When the press published that a new movie about Oz would be shoot, I panicked. How dare they? The Wizard is untouchable. After I calmed me down, I realized that could be interesting. Even though, I was really apprehensive about the result (I don't know why, but maybe it was because the old Oz movie crew was in my childhood memories). Movie released and I was at the cinema the day after. I did not have the idea that I was on the edge of watching a wonderful film. Every single detail (including lines, sceneries, digital stuff) was perfectly put. The crew was incredible. My special congratulations to Michelle Williams, her performance was fabulous. James Franco as Oz was brilliant. Rachel Weisz could not be more fantastic. Mila Kunis - famous by former the TV series That's 70 Show – was growing up with the character Sam Raimi, for me, is much more respectable as director than before, he made a masterpiece. I hope Sam Raimi knows that. About the plot, the story was being told in a beautiful way, revealing how the characters were inside their soul slowly and without loses the magic. I can not forget how amazing was all the people of Oz! What can I say? If you still do not watch OZ THE GREAT AND POWERFUL, get out of this chair and go now! You will not regret, I promise you!",Oz the Great and Powerful
317,MuntherHamdon,virgin eyes,8,25 July 2013,"After reading many other reviews, I have come to learn that there were several adaptations to the wizard of oz such as wiked, return to Oz, the Wiz etc. Personally, I have only ever seen the story of Dorothy in the original version.Without knowing any back story about the land of Oz and the 3 witches, this movie tells a tale of an origin story with plentiful charm and stunning visuals.To my eyes, Oz himself was fantastically portrayed, and James Franco delivered absolutely remarkably on his performance; more so because of his inherent good nature and warm smile rather than with his acting. This was a children's story, and the producer and director kept the realm and the acting appropriately for children. The story reminded me of and had a flow and feeling similar to Shrek. Some movie goers have complained about a lack of surprises, but I felt the movie contained plenty. I was surprised when Oz found out that glenda was the good witch and the wicked witch was in Emerald city. Also, the evil monkeys were defeated in a quick war with no deaths using a clever surprise of robotic farmers holding eternal sleep poppy seedlings to gas the monkeys. I also felt the surprise ending with the 'stars' reigning down on the two witches was a beautiful ending. I give the movie an 8, because I believe the witches could have assumed a little more maturity, and i also believe a brief 3 min introduction on what the land of Oz is and how the witches derived their power would have been appropriate. The great and powerful Oz that we wind up seeing in The Wizard of Oz fits perfectly and ties together. At the end, I felt happy, and could only imagine the number of children who felt the same way.:)",Oz the Great and Powerful
318,Ari97,"Good graphic designing, not such a good film.",4,18 August 2013,"I had been really excited about watching Oz, but the movie was somewhat a disappointment. However, I will begin by referring to its good points.The graphic-designing guys really did their best. The land of Oz was very beautifully designed, and I really enjoyed this part of the film. Rachel Weisz was pretty good playing the wicked Evanora and Mila Kunis did the best she could with the lines she had.Now let's go to the bad points. To begin with, this is supposed to be a prequel to the classic book. I do not believe the author would be delighted to see Oz as a womanizer who made all the women drop dead for him with a music box, and I wasn't delighted as well. The plot was OKish for the first 30 minutes, but after that it turned me off. The characters of Theodora and Glinda were both cliché and stiff. And what do we get out of this? That the blonde good witch gets the guy, and the innocent and naive one turns wicked because of someone she knew only one day. I found this especially annoying, partly because I understood where the film is going from the first 40 minutes.I knew this film would be fantasy adventure before I watched, but I still tried to find some meaning other than ""the bad guy became a good guy"" or ""the beautiful girl gets the man"", and I could not.I give it a 4/10 for the reasons I have already mentioned. Watch it if you like fantasy and visual effects, but don't hold your breath for excitement.",Oz the Great and Powerful
319,ganielpeep,"an awful prequel, with no ruby red but plenty of green screen",2,28 August 2013,"This movie is poorly acted, packed with super fake cg backgrounds, and empty of care or concern for a single character. The only actor who seemed to bring any emotion or connection from the audience was Zach Braff, and he was promptly turned into a terrible comic relief monkey. Thus leaving the film in the hands of james and mila who oddly get worse as the film goes on. I'll admit bias on my part as I've never been a fan of weiz, so I also didn't like her in this role but I've like braff, mila, and james in other films and shows. Large missed point I had beef with as well, if your doing a prequel to the wizard of oz and establishing the characters shouldn't the one dorthy crushes with the house be seen in the trademark ruby red shoes at least once? Otherwise your missing the biggest icon in the movies. But here it can be forgiven as the more space and less connection this awful creation has from the original classic the better. If your looking to see a recent Oz themed movie I'd watch the muppets oz movie and avoid this movie like the plague.

320,SmartFace,Enjoyable,7,23 June 2013,"I haven't read other reviews of this film. I went in only with a desire to see an origin story for the Wizard of Oz and expected little. That said, this was an enjoyable movie that has plenty of thrills and a surprising and fun style. James Franco does a convincing enough job as the wizard but even more interesting is the development of the wicked witch. The performances were average to good (Zach Braff in human form was a little distracting but he did well as a monkey). The special effects sort of parallel those of ""The Wizard of Oz"".

I Guess.",5,12 October 2013,"**Not necessarily spoilers, but there may be some hints to future events in the movie, so I am taking precautions by saying there are spoilers in this review.** This movie tries to accomplish a great deal, but I don't think it quite made it.Weisz and Williams were fun, and believable with their characters. Franco was right on the money sometimes, but at other times, he was way, way off the mark. I hate to say this, because I normally like her work, but Kunis was off far, far more often than she was on. She seemed less than natural, her performance was either far too demure, or way over the top. She lacked subtlety, which is generally how I feel about the movie.So, the dialogue: It was all open mouth speechifying. There was no emotional subtext. Everyone broadcast their feelings, and so it felt over-the-top and wooden in many cases. It was too ""fresh"" in the sense that it didn't feel like I was watching an epic event unfold before my eyes, but instead I was watching an unpolished troupe re-enact an epic event, and I know that just can't be right, because some of the actors in this film were very polished actors.It was way too modern, not in the sense that I could understand it easily, but in the sense that I could walk out onto the street and hear similar phrases being spoken between persons. Worse, there was no warmth to it, no inflection. It was simple recitation. Tab A into Slot B. Yell Here. Moment of Inspiration Here. Sign name on dotted line here. Initial here. It felt more like caricatures quoting lines than it did characters coming to life.I'm not saying it was a bad movie, because it isn't. I'm not saying it was a good movie, because it isn't. It is a ""reaching"" movie. They were reaching for something grand in scale, but they fell short. I would consider it a mediocre movie. Not bad, not good, but okay. A way to pass the time if there's nothing else.I'd like to leave this on a positive note, so I will say this: The first word that came to mind when I saw Oz appear in full color, and at full screen, was: ""sumptuous.""

324,uptowndcsoulja-638-634479,"Over all, this film is a must see for anyone who has seen and loves The Wizard Of Oz.",8,16 April 2013,"One of my favorite movies as a child was a film we all grew up watching every year when it was aired on TV as a Holiday Special, Judy Garland in ""The Wizard Of Oz."" Trying to make a prequel to such a legendary film must have been extremely challenging for Director Sam Raimi. The beginning of ""Oz The Great And Powerful"" is very original and unique, as the film projector projected a smaller size square screen in black and white instead of the bigger colorful wide screen that we're use to. The main character Oz (short for Oscar) is played by James Franco who is one of my favorite actors and who was perfect for the part as Oz. Beautiful actresses were chosen to play the 3-witches. Mila Kunis who played Theodora was my favorite of the 3. She put on a great memorable performance that will definitely pull you emotionally into this film. The only thing that was lacking about her role was the simple lines that made you want to hear her say something more dramatic, since she had a more powerful role in this film. Michelle Williams played Glinda the good witch and she played her part very well. Unlike The Wizard Of Oz, this film has a love triangle which gave this movie depth and made it more interesting to watch. This movie gave us a glimpse into the prequels' development of the 2 main characters, Oz and Theodora. Rachel Weisz who played Evenora was the only character that had an English accent. She too played a memorable role, over shadowed by only Oz and Theodora. The other 2 characters that I liked was Knuck played by long time short actor Tony Cox, and Finley the monkey with the voice of Zach Braff – they both brought the laughter and comedy into this movie.The major thing that sets Oz The Great And Powerful apart from Judy Garland's The Wizard Of Oz, is the fact that there isn't any singing – except for 2-minutes when the Little Munchkins made there appearance, and the song they sang was not melodic and could never compare to the original The Wizard Of Oz soundtrack. Powerful songs similar to ""Over The Rainbow,"" ""If I Only Had A,"" and some of the other great ""melodic"" songs that were in the original The Wizard Of Oz soundtrack could've been what this movie needed to make it a classic – a newer up to date ""melodic"" soundtrack. What was lacking in terms of soundtrack was made up by the visual cinematography that was very spectacular and truly memorable to behold. The 3-D effects were great and the CGI was done very precise – I loved the waterfall scenes and the hot air balloon action scenes.Over all, this film is a must see for anyone who has seen and loves The Wizard Of Oz. Oz The Great And Powerful is visually magnificent and the characters Oz and Theodora are truly unforgettable. Throughout this great film you'll witness how Oscar the mean womanizing conman become the unlikely Hero, and how a couple of beautiful witches become evil in the very green Emerald City. What makes this movie even more interesting is the unexpected twist at the end that creates The Wizard of Oz we all know. Oz was simply amazing, and judging by how the movie ended, it would be great if they made a Part-2 to this prequel – telling the story of what happened to The Wicked Witch of the East right before Dorothy lands in Munchkin Land I guess we'll have to wait and see.I give ""Oz The Great And Powerful"" 8 out of 10 Stars",Oz the Great and Powerful

Once a person lets this one stand on its own, it becomes more coherent and satisfying.Of course there are liberties taken with characters in this re-imagining through film making. That is Hollywood, an unacceptable place for purists. But the special effects honor the time-period effects of the classic film as being state of the art of the day.The characters, good and evil, all do their parts nicely, and the darn witch is wicked and scary as she should be. If a person doesn't expect Judy Garland, Toto and the rest to fill in the blanks before they ever arrived in Oz, this film can give the viewer a nice, escapist trip.",Oz the Great and Powerful
327,DigitalRitual,Film shares Tin Man's Woe,5,15 March 2013,"Don't expect any of the ""magic"" that made the original film a family favorite for many, many millions around the world with it's memorable songs, dialog, and above all heartwarming characters that were beloved by so many. with this ""prequel,"" if you're feeling anything more than tepid by the end.The film begins with the introduction of James Franco as Oz, and you are immediately cooled by his performance. I think I'd have found Dean Cain a more believable and less disingenuous Oz than Franco, so it goes without saying that I'm convinced just about ANY other name in Hollywood would have been a better lead. Mila Kunis is also miscast, but much of that problem also lies with the script, whereas Franco is just plain bad.The use of CGI effects was fine, even seamless in some points, and unlike films like Burton's Alice in Wonderland, certainly didn't detract or distract.The main flaw in this film was the script, and it's lack of heart. It played much like an after-school special or a Sunday night Disney film of old, and not the good ones. Like the Tin Man, the writers failed to put any heart into the film, with poorly scripted characters that were at best cute (Michelle Williams/Glenda, or Joey King/China Girl) and at worst completely unlikeable (James Franco/Oz, Tony Cox/Knuck, Mila Kunis/Theodora/Wicked Witch of the West). There was little in the way of emotional attachment to the characters like the original 1939 film offered.There was one VERY brief (thankfully) attempt at a song, which going by the quality of that tune, would have lead to disaster had they pursued it further. And for a ""prequel,"" which had little in common with Frank Baum's vision of the Land of Oz, it left out so many things you'd expect such as Ruby Slippers, or how Finley would ultimately wind up in the service of the Wicked Witch by the next/original film. And that's just to name a couple. So many possibilities left unexplored or unexplained. There are two ways to handle a prequel, either faithfully, lovingly loyal to the original, or attempting something bold, or better yet both. Sadly, the writers, Kapner and Lindsay-Abair, did neither.After a rather predictable and ""safe"" journey, the film concludes and there is none of the warmth or fondness of it's predecessor, but rather a Luke-warm feeling.It might be OK for very small children, but it will certainly offer very little for the rest of the family, and will by no means become a beloved classic like it's predecessor.",Oz the Great and Powerful
328,jaylveck,Beautiful and amazing!!!,10,26 March 2013,"I am so surprised that people don't appreciate the beauty and awe of this picture. Then again, should I be surprised that people every day in all aspects of society tear down beautiful things like forests and architecture? No, because it happens all the time. I took my daughter to this and we watched it in 3D. I was not much in the mood for a movie and I really had no idea what to expect. I thought this movie was brilliant and it truly took me to another place. I was glued to the screen and couldn't take my eyes off. It was so good all the way through.Yes I have read the complaints from critics (who are all failed artists in my opinion) knocking it for everything from James Franco's performance (which I thought was brilliant and inspiring) to a thin storyline, etc. Blah, blah, blah.All I can say is you critics are so busy over-analyzing every little detail you learned in some acting class somewhere that you missed the point of the movie: just sit there and enjoy it! This is true creativity. You have lost your sense of childlike wonderment about the world. None of you would ever be able to accomplish something like this.My daughter and I both loved it. I think Raimi's vision was well executed and the cast and crew did a great job. I think it's better than the original OZ movie. Is it sacrilegious to say that?The 3D was the best 3D yet. Way better than Avatar in the 3D department. This film is a masterpiece of color, it was beyond beautiful. It was so beautiful...the actresses have never looked better either. Franco was cool in the real sense and he looked like it. This movie was perfectly made and I felt like I was there. In a cynical world where art seems to be less and less appreciated, I cannot help but stand up and say I loved it amidst all the ""popular"" critics' opinions.",Oz the Great and Powerful
329,lalaland-21-224850,"Beautifully animated, brilliantly told prequel to the great classic",10,3 April 2013,"What can I say? This movie is one of the best I've ever seen. First of all, the animation in this movie, combined with the 3D effect, was absolutely stunning and breathtaking. I actually believed that I was there, in the land of Oz. It was so detailed, vibrant and colorful, really popping out of the screen and bringing the beauty to life. The variety too was also amazing. The animation wasn't just colorful and happy, but also dark and sinister. Each animated object seemed perfectly designed and brought to life, I loved it. Secondly, the acting was brilliant. James Franco did a great job with his role of the somewhat egotistical, selfish, cowardly yet somehow good-hearted Kansas magician, he was so believable. Rachel Weisz was fantastic, her sassy and bold performance as Evanora the Wicked Witch was brilliant too. Each actor devoted lots of emotion and skill to their role, and it all worked perfectly. Last but certainly not least, the story and content itself. Wow. I don't even know what to say. It was well written and well thought out, with each detail working perfectly. I thought it was a brilliant prequel because it followed on from all of the original themes, but added some extra magic to it, like the people of Oz resembling the people of their reality, the fraudulent wizard, the witches, etc. It explained wonderfully how the wizard of Oz came to be. At times, it was a little predictable, but it still kept me on the edge of my seat. There were moments of humor, joy, sadness, romance and adventure, all rolled into one perfectly. The plot tied in really well and fit perfectly with the original. It's hard to explain, but it was just so awesome. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone looking for anything from mild entertainment to rich, amazing masterpieces. A movie to satisfy all, and a must-see.",Oz the Great and Powerful
330,bourdan,"Should be called ""Weisz, The Great and Powerful"" because it is her performance that single handedly redeems this film.",6,28 February 2013,"Sam Raimi's prequel to L Frank Baum's Series of children's books plays greatly into Raimi's strengths as a director. A strong imaginary world that is covered in light and darkness and characters that inhabit that world with a quirky feel of childhood imagination. Raimi literally puts his heart and soul into this production and it shows, giving a festival of the senses with the viewer's imagination. While Raimi is working over time to make all of this work, a weak script and bad casting of two very important key roles set him back. The only thing that puts this film back on track is the game performances by two of the film's other actors, one in particular whose performance keeps this film from sinking from its own lack of depth.For what does not work, look no further than the script, which is not very well put together. Yes, it is a kid's film but kids are a lot more sophisticated than some of the dialog here and some of the kids in the audience I was with moaned a bit while hearing it. Moreover, yes, it is a prequel to a story that many people know, so there should not be any real surprises but that is no excuse to be lazy with the script and the scriptwriting is lazy here. What makes the problems with the script jump out here is some of the casting, which is just bad. A good actor is able to make a bad script some how work for their character; a bad actor only magnifies the scripts problems and makes their character look worse. Unfortunately, we have two actors completely wrong for their roles here and it only makes this movie even a bigger chore to sit throw. The first cinematic offense is the main character Oscar Diggs, who is not only the weakest character in the film but has an actor who just not believable in the role. James Franco can be a decent actor when he tries and he can be infuriatingly bad when he just stands there and not care about his performance, which he does here in this film. The character of Oscar Diggs is supposed to be the anchor of this film, a man that has to see the error of his ways in order to be the man that he is destine to be. However, thanks to Franco's lazy performance and the weakness of the script, we really cannot see the good in the character and is not impressed with his changed of heart when the time came to prove himself. Oscar comes across more as a sleazy opportunist than a man conflicted with his inner self and we cannot root for him at all. The character is wasted opportunity and really does not add to the story and thanks to Franco's inability to show sincerity with his role, we really do not care at all about poor Oscar or his problems. Another character we end up not caring for is the character of Theodora, who (Come on, the cat has been out of the bag for a while) becomes the Wicked Witch of the West. Thanks to the script and Mila Kunis inability to show range or any emotion outside of anger, we do not care about how this character loses her innocents to become the evil witch and we do not care what happens afterwords. While both Kunis and Franco fall flat on their faces performance wise, not all the actors fall by the waste side and some of them are able to transcend the weak script in order to gives performances than is able to salvage the good Sam Raimi tries to give to this film. The first one belongs to Michelle Williams, who plays Glenda the good witch and manages to give off the right kind of goodness and decency that her character needed to be believable with out the added fake sweetness. She is genuine and believable and is able to make her character work despite the weakness of the script. It also helps that Williams is an amazing actor with a lot of range and is able to tap into her strengths to achieve this feat. The best performance however belongs to the great Rachel Weisz, who almost single handedly saves this film from all of its shortcomings with a performance that not only transcends its weak script but also manages to be even better technically than the film as a whole. When the script keeps moving south, Its Weisz that keeps moving the film forward. She gives a fun and sassy performance that manages to make the character of Evanora much more than the standard fairy tale villain and manages to give off a level of understanding and complexity that does not talk down to its audience. It is a brilliant performance with a weak script and only the best actors manage to accomplish that feat with out breaking a sweat and Weisz does that effortlessly.While the script is weak and some of the performances pretty bad, it is the efforts of Weisz, Williams and Raimi that keeps it from falling off a cliff. For them only is the reason you should see this movie.",Oz the Great and Powerful
331,homiep87,Oz the Pretty Good and Powerful,6,20 May 2013,"Oz: The Great and Powerful directed by Sam Raimi, who did a personal favorite movie series of mine, Spiderman. Going into this movie I didn't really know what to expect. I wasn't sure how I felt about the story of the movie and I didn't know how I would feel about the setting and how it looked. After leaving the theater, I found myself neither in awe or in disappointment.Story: The story starts with Oz (James Franco), except he's not the wizard we know from the 1939 classic. He's a regular magician, that's not making any money. He's greedy, narcissistic, and a huge liar. Well he gets in trouble, hops in his hot air balloon, and goes right into a tornado. This is where the actual movie begins. Oz lands his air balloon in Oz where he meets Theodora (Mila Kunis). She tells him the prophecy that a wizard with the same name as her land will come take the thrown at the Emerald City and defeat The Wicked Witch. Once Oz gets a taste for his throne, he then goes on his witch hunt accompanied by his friends that he meets on the way. Not everything is as it seems in Oz and there turns out to be a lot more going on than what meets the eye.Acting: James Franco gives a normal performance. Nothing fantastic, but nothing bad. He fits the character right, and gives an enjoyable performance. Mila Kunis starts by giving a okay performance, but as the story goes on she gets better and better. Zach Braff gives a pretty good and funny performance. I got a good couple laughs out of him. Where this movie really shines is in Rachel Weisz's performance. She gives a terribly wicked performance (in a good way). The acting overall was good, but nothing great.Filming: Sam Raimi really does well with this film. It starts off like the 1939 classic in black and white. The screen is shrunk, but once the audience is shown Oz the screen gets larger and the colors pour in. The first sight of Oz is a beautiful one, and it continues to be beautiful all the way through. The only issue I have with how Oz looks is that it felt more like a place I would find in Alice in Wonderland, not Oz. Most of the movie's CGI is great and doesn't feel awkward. Sam Raimi gives a great movie that is visually appealing.Conclusion: Oz is a fun and enjoyable movie, but its nothing great. I feel that the look of Oz, feeling like a Alice in Wonderland setting, was the worst part of this film for me. It took me a bit to really get into the whole ""Oz"" feeling of it. Overall the performances were good, the story was enjoyable, and the visuals were beautiful. I feel most people will have fun with this movie, but don't go in expecting anything great. Expect to have fun and be visually pleased, its a entertaining movie and worth seeing.",Oz the Great and Powerful
332,jchristopher3308,Raimi nailed it! Outstanding family film!!,9,9 March 2013,"Oz the Great and Powerful is the best family movie I've taken my kids to since WALL-E in 2008 and I would venture to say that this film is as on par with the original ""The Wizard of Oz"" as is possible. Sam Raimi's direction and style are on display here and in my opinion this is easily his best piece to date. I hope he is given a chance to put his twist on The Wizard of Oz story and who knows? Maybe even make his own Wizard of Oz sequel and turning this into an Oz trilogy! He is an outstanding filmmaker and I was delighted to see how he handled this material.The special effects are awe-inspiring and relevant and most importantly contribute to the story and legacy of the land of Oz in magnificent ways. This is unquestionably the best use of 3D that I've ever seen. Franco gives a very strong best performance and Mila Kunis was surprisingly awesome in her role as well. Why people are knocking these two is absurd and I think that will become very evident to the majority of people who watch this gem. If you like great fantasy family-friendly films in the vein of Shrek, The Princess Bride, Star Wars, WALL-E or The Wizard of Oz do not miss this movie!",Oz the Great and Powerful

336,kcastro3,Oz: The...Nope.,2,5 May 2013,"I'd like to premise this review by saying that my expectations of this film were surprisingly low. Also, I should state that the movie screen went blurry quite a few times consequently impairing my movie going experience and possibly my reaction to the film as a whole. Yet I stand firmly in my initial response to the film. ""Oz: The Great and Powerful"" is a dud, a drag, and the antithesis of a ""must see"" film. First and foremost the visuals were disappointing. I believe that half of what Disney was trying to sell the audience on was the enchanting and advanced visual effects. This, however, did not translate well from trailer to full theatrical film. The special effects were so artificial that it was borderline tacky. I understand that Oz is in itself a mystical and magical place, but if they were going to undertake the challenge of transforming it into a believable universe for the audience then they should have stepped up their game. I'm not sure if it was the cinematographers, the graphics department, or Sam Raimi (the director) who dropped the ball, but it wouldn't surprise me if it turned out to be every single creative mind involved. And if this feat was too much for Disney then they should have minimized the usage of green screens. If the effects had been bettered executed the film may have been more bearable. The other half of what Disney so heavily marketed this film on was the story. This was a prequel to ""The Wizard of Oz"", a film that is adored and revered generation to generation. ""Oz: The Great and Powerful"", however, will have no such luck being remotely remembered once gone from the theaters. My biggest issue with the storyline had to do with that fact that the writers took the first five minutes of Dorothy entering Oz and stretched it to 130 minutes. There is an evil green witch with flying monkey minions, a sister, and a hatred for Oz (the land and the wizard). There was nothing incorporated into this film that added any depth to the original story. (This is what I imagine die-hard ""Star Wars"" fans thought of ""Episode III"".) ""Wicked"" (the novel turned Broadway musical) epitomizes the right way to produce a prequel. It flipped what the audience thought they knew, created a whole new tale, and still respected and paid homage the original. The biggest plot twist in this movie, Glinda isthe good witch. In the current times of Hollywood where we are so severely lacking any new insightful story lines that ""The Hobbit"" needed to be cut into three separate films, I could see why this movie was made. Did it, however, need to be? Not really. If the writing and acting had been flawless, maybe I wouldn't be as frustrated. Too bad this is not the case. I've already touched upon the writing in relation to the story. What I would like to further expand on is the humor (or lack of). I should note that while sitting in the theater, before the film started, I made myself laugh with a joke about two talking muffins. I don't posses a highbrow sense of humor, but even I found the jokes and one-liners in the movie to be immature and silly. One of the biggest laughs was initiated from a sneezing monkey. A sneezing monkey. It's an infant's sense of humor; the equivalent of someone closing his eyes then opening them and shouting ""peek-a-boo"". And though I would never want to be the comedy police, telling anyone what is and is not funny, I would go as far to say that this wasn't the strongest comedic writing. The acting was even worse. James Franco was even more intoxicated and out of it then he was in ""Pineapple Express"". He was all over the place. In the beginning his ""wink, wink, nudge, nudge"" at being a conman was too much. Then midway through the film he became so commonplace and boring that he fell into the background. Usually I love Mila Kunis, but her over the top wickedness and portrayal of a woman scored made Sylvia Plath and Virginia Wolfe look sane. And the only thing more painful to watch than Michelle Williams's performance was the hideous chicken feathered costume she wore. They all lacked conviction and it seemed as though the actors enjoyed acting in the film as much as I did watching it. I give this film a D+. This saddens me. Not because I was hoping for it be better, but worse. The last thirty minutes of the movie were so campy and ridiculous that it created a false sense of entertainment. Something happens when a movie crosses the line of ""bad film"" to ""tragically terrible film"". People will rally behind the latter and lovingly title them ""cult classics"". ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"" anyone? In my humble opinion Disney should have committed to the campiness of it all. Alas this was neither great, nor powerful.",Oz the Great and Powerful
337,chris_mcsweeney,"Visually Adequate, Horribly Anti-Feminist",4,11 October 2013,"Privilege CHECK: I am a straight, white male, aged 21. This is what I thought of the movie;Blah blah blah, fine visual effects, blah blah. I'll get straight to the point. This film sucks in terms of the message it's sending to kids; specifically young girls. The original ""The Wizard of Oz"" was significantly ahead of its time in terms of feminism, and it's over 70 years old. ""Oz: The Great and Powerful"" is a very confusing step backward, all arguments of cheap Hollywood-remake cash-grabbing aside. Here is why...It's easy to spot true feminism in contemporary cinema with a few very simple questions;1: Is there more than one female main character? 2: If yes, do they ever speak to each other? 3: If yes, do those conversations address something besides the leading male character? 4: Does their motivation go further than getting the aforementioned man, or ""Mr. Right"" at the end? If the answer to all four is yes, then that there is probably a true feminist piece, as it depicts independent women making independent decisions to achieve their own goals. This is a good message to send young girls, and you may notice that ""The Wizard of Oz"" accomplishes this perfectly. If the answer to any of those questions is no, then that is faux-feminism, and Hollywood is incredibly fond of this in a supposedly post-feminist world. You may notice that ""Oz: The Great and Powerful"" falls down on questions 3 and 4, often in a jaw-droppingly lunk-headed fashion. Let's examine this in more detail;EVERY WOMAN IN THIS FILM ONLY EVER DOES ANYTHING FOR JAMES FRANCO'S BENEFIT, EVEN THOUGH HE IS BLATANTLY A TOTAL DONG.Seriously, right from the get-go, Mila Kunis in her needlessly tight leather pants can't wait to give him the keys to the kingdom and (presumably) sleep with him, only to later get dumped and go on a psychotic rampage, totally turning her own life upside down and throwing away what was probably a very lucrative career as a princess of whatever. Rachel Weisz is evil anyway, but every discussion she has, and for that matter everything she does has something to do with James Franco, who's been cheaply shoved into the story because there was a prophecy he'd bring balance to the force or whatever. Michelle Williams, in spite of her being able to practise magic, making her infinitely more powerful than James Franco, in his capacity as just some guy, still ends up subservient to Franco's character at the end because he sort-of helped rid the kingdom of the Wicked Witch of the Wherever.Nitpicking aside, if you break the original and this prequel down to its most basic message that young girls will take away, it is this;""The Wizard of Oz"": As a young woman it is important to be brave, clever and kind to others - especially those less fortunate - to succeed in your goals. You must also look after your dog.""Oz: The Great and Powerful"": It is very important to be pretty and get a hot guy like James Franco. If he runs off with a hot blonde, however, it's probably your fault for being a b!tch. Worse still is the message that young boys may take away: No matter how much more talented, moral or intelligent she may be, you're still the man so your goals are more important. Casual infidelity and stringing girls along is also totally fine and there will be no consequences.This seems a little strange to me that was is effectively a remake could be so backward in it's message, compared to the source material which is ancient by cinema standards. This is so bizarre in fact, it completely overshadows everything else in the film. But as for the film itself, it was powerfully average green screen schlock. 4/10. Don't see it, definitely don't take your kids to see it.",Oz the Great and Powerful

339,traveller007,"In Imax and 3D, Oz is a Great Movie & a Fine Movie Experience",9,13 March 2013,"...as an Artist or sorts, I was particularly delighted by how certain elements went out of frame in the movie...a fire breather, the breath of furious fire goes far beyond rectangle on the screen; a dove flies off out of the frame, as does falling snow.Brave. Cool, almost a Brechtian alienation device that works...not as off putting, but to add to the delight of being fooled by the movie and yet being pulled in ever greater.The 3D was spectacular and effective. Interestingly, the trailers for Ironman 3 and a remastering of Jurassic Park just did not work and need to be seen in normal 2D. 3D can be badly used, but 3D was planned for Oz from the beginning and so fit seamlessly into the story adding depth and cool effects.The story was fine, the writing was tight, interesting and full of inside references to the original Wizard of Oz. The colors were bright and bold, the sunflowers turned and followed characters as the moved; it was fun; shadows were suitably dark and full of menace when appropriate. Smoke and clouds were deep and dense, they had tactile sense about them, a weight that one could feel out in the movie audience.There are objections, but not by me. Some complain that Oscar (James Franco) was not sympathetic, he was smarmy and a seducer...Yes? That's what he was and I was totally taken in and went with the movie; I was transfixed and transported for 2 hours plus.I thought that Mila Kunis was just fine as a wronged woman; I liked her and lot and while certainly always radiantly beautiful, Michelle Williams seemed, to me, to be the weakest of witches in acting range. Though adorable and lovely throughout she remained. The actors were who they were supposed to be; there was a naturalism about the characters to me; I sense some people wanted over the top, scenery chewing acting; I thought the tone was restrained just right for each of the characters.There is a lot of hate for this movie; leave your adult at the door and you will have delightful and smiling experience.Best Wishes, Traveller",Oz the Great and Powerful

From the Black and White scenery in Kansas to the Colorful views of the land of OZ. It was interesting how they made the Kansas scenes full screen and as he landed in OZ it slowly became wide screen. The Special Effects were astounding and the the new and old characters were a delight to see. SPOILER The Transition of Kunis into the other wicked sister seemed kinda short. Seems like he should have spent a little more time with her for her to fall that hard for him. Glenda is referred to as the Good witch of the South, but according to ""The Wizard of Oz"" film(I didn't read any of Baum's Book's)she is referred to as the Good witch of the South. Also, I believe the Poppy field was created by the Wicked witch of the west for Dorothy in the original Oz film to trap her and her group, but thats a mute point. Hmmm? Thanks for no singing too!

341,MisterNicholas,Oz: Anything BUT Great & Powerful,6,20 March 2013,"Okay. So I was excited for this film for quite some time now. Back in October or so when I first saw the trailer, I instantly wanted to see it. It's too bad that it was such a letdown. Don't get me wrong, the cinematics are gorgeous. The colors pop and everything is sharp and beautiful. But then the characters speak. The writing in this film is laughable, even during scenes that are meant to be taken seriously. James Franco and Mila Kunis just didn't please me either. The only two that really stood out for me were Michelle Williams (Glinda) and Rachel Weisz (Evanora). The film felt too rushed, especially in the beginning. When Oz and Theodora met, they literally fell in love within 5 minutes. When Oz ""cheated"" on her after the one hour they've known each other, that's when Theodora snaps. So basically the entire story of the wicked witch is based on a relationship that hadn't even lasted a day. To me, that can't be taken seriously.Also, the only action scene that took place didn't even make sense. The poppy field that put all of the flying monkeys to sleep was directly in front of Emerald City, yet somehow the witches were shocked when this occurred. But this could just be me. So if you're wanting to see it in theaters, I say go. I'm only saying this for the cinematics though. Because this film looks gorgeous on the big screen. Other than that, I say wait to Redbox it.",Oz the Great and Powerful

For example Mila's character (which changes the most of all) is just idiotic and unbelievable thin: 1. overly attached girlfriend (bc Oz lays eyes on her) 2. jealous for no reason 3. that jealous she kills her feelings with the help of an green witch-apple(he met him yesterday) 4. bad modeled green witchAnd all the Film i just thought ""whipe that stupid grin off your face James Franco"" (his character doesn't make progress at all in this movie, he's just an self loving and sadly uncharmant asshole till the very end) and ""shut the hell up, Meg""",Oz the Great and Powerful
343,brownjul,Fairy Tale Film for the Family and For Those Who See Deeper,10,24 March 2013,"Fairy tales historically were created to have children (or to remind the child within the adult which still remained) learn to identify and access the best of universal human values. If listened to with an open heart and brilliant mind a good fairy tale would teach us how to make the journey through life. The journey would first be uncomfortable as it would inevitably take us from the ordinary into the realm of the extraordinary. To become kind, good, unselfish, and loving are the values in this film without thought of reciprocity. Just like the characters in the film, the viewer can find the best in ourselves and others through watching the transformation of these same characters as every act progresses. OZ is fairy tale that reminds us all once again what it is to be human through great dialogue, acting, and incredible special effects (saw it first without 3-D, then returned yesterday to see it in 3-D). See it twice. The richness will create magic that will linger. Perhaps, just like Dorothy did in the original classic which this film mirrors, you will hear Glinda, resonate a well needed nudge, that the power to change and conquer fear power has always been available from within you.",Oz the Great and Powerful

I see that many people have already written reviews about the short-comings of the film of which I completely agree. I offer my views.One could argue that this is a children's movie thus all short-comings in the mind of an adult do not apply, but damn't Disney, you had a huge budget, and an innovative director. What happened? Why James Franco? Why does the wicked witches make-up color and lack of normalcy look identical to Jim Carrey's in The Mask? Two and a half hours of viewing? and not one honest moment, or any heart and soul in the movie? One lesson I've learned in screen writing is, you've got to make the audience give a damn about the characters. I say this is also the downfall of the recent Tim Burton movies (Alice, Willy Wonka, Dark Shadows) Have you guys forgotten how to write a compelling story? With compelling characters? Tim, you did it before. Sam, you've done if before.I see raving about how great the CGI is in this film, but the monkey still don't look real.You could say it's easy for me to sit on my couch and give a negative review to a movie, and it is. But in this day and age I expect better. As a small time film maker working on a zero budget and a day job, where I have no hope of special effects, and locations are always found through prayer and what I can fast-talk my way into, I find it disturbing that a company with all resources at hand can't produce a truly inspired spectacle. Again I believe this film (as well as others) are missing a heart and soul. Perhaps they should have put the Tin Man in it somehow.If this wasn't a Disney flick would it have been better?My final thoughts: Warmed over generic pablum for the masses. Don't get me started on Cowboys and Aliens.",Oz the Great and Powerful
345,kandoo26,Oz - Not really great yet powerful enough to entertain,9,1 April 2013,"Went to the movie with the expectation that it would be another silly fantasy movie made just for the sake of fetching more money in IMAX/3D screens. I was wrong and being a person raised seeing Wonderful wizard of OZ cartoons, I felt this movie was done as a proper prequel. Do not expect a lot from this movie, yet it is fun guaranteed. All the actors have acted well. Movie goes in a very good pace without us getting bored. Disney has done justice to the level possible. It made my day on the long weekend. Could not be a great fantasy like Lord of the rings or hobbit yet it is very good and effective. It was also good to see a beautiful aspect of the wicked witch.",Oz the Great and Powerful
346,lynsaygreen-255-439341,Oz: The Dull and Lackluster,5,12 June 2013,"As a fan of the original 1939 classic The Wizard of Oz I admit I was intrigued to see the origin tale of Oz and all the characters we've come to know and love. Unfortunately, I was not left blown away by the movie. Essentially, the scenery appears to be the real star of the movie, with the characters added in to give a sense of nostalgia for the viewer.In saying that, it isn't entirely a disaster; the film boasts a great amount of CGI that is stunning, but beyond the spectacle of Oz itself, it has nothing new to offer. My main issue is really with the characters within the story; I just didn't care about them. I know that Oz is supposed to be smug and narcissistic and then develop into the hero, but his journey was just predictable and therefore not particularly interesting. His sidekicks actually interested me more because they were funny and endearing in their own ways, even though we don't really get to see much of them at all.Then there's Glinda, the Good Witch of the North. Unfortunately she fits in as the stereotypical romantic interest who helps the hero discover the greatness within himself, but she is really bland; there's nothing interesting about her in regards to personality or character development. And her connection with looking like Dorothy's Aunty Em is really the only part of her story I found interesting. The villainess Evanora, played by the fantastic Rachel Weisz, also disappoints; we don't know why she's evil except that she made herself that way. There's no back story for Endora to show why she is evil, yet Glinda's story about her father is all that they seem to talk about. Evanora starts off as potentially the villain before taking a back seat for the majority of the second half. The focus shift is the part that I was really looking forward to: How does the Wicked Witch of the West come to be? Through a broken heart. That's it. She falls for Oz after knowing him for five minutes and becomes insanely attached; rather than being cute it kinda makes her look a bit crazy and desperate; and a possible bunny boiler. Through her sister's manipulation Theodora witnesses Oz and Glinda together and is heartbroken, believing the Don Juan has betrayed her. This is sad for any girl, but there's hardly any development into the relationship between Oz and Theodora to make it heartbreaking. We know that Oz is a player, so we're not really surprised when Theodora learns that he had no plans of spending his life with her. The evolution of the iconic wicked witch being a result of a broken heart could've been so much better; the tragedy is that the story isn't well developed enough to make us hope for her redemption. We want her to be evil because that's why we loved her in The Wizard of Oz. The transformation of Theodora is very impressive, and a lot of work has gone into making this the most anticipated transformation in the film, way more than Oz's, but the young girl she was before just didn't really have any interesting characteristics about her to make us feel sorry for her; she was similar to Glinda, except even more naive. The finale was quite good. Oz comes up with a good plan and saves the day, sending the wicked witches on their way, but it's still predictable. There's nothing new for an audience to really learn about the characters because they aren't very well developed. The real star of the film is OZ itself. The CGI is great, to the point of overshadowing the narrative. I think Oz: The Great and Powerful is a good popcorn film, but nothing else. What really made the film suffer was the lack of characterization. Oz was a jerk and then had an epiphany, not really a surprise without much just cause; Glinda is the angelic witch without any flaws whatsoever thus making her really dull; Evanora had the potential to be a good villain but she was sidelined in favour of her sister. Theodora as a good witch wasn't interesting at all, and way too naive; her transformation is the best part of the film, with the green hand and black nails scratching the surface of a table, then the excitement dissipated with no real development beyond Theodora's evolution as the Wicked Witch. The characters don't really change at all, only carry on doing the same thing as before. The film fails where the original succeeded - interesting characters that feel love, pain, fear, anger etc. Here they don't go through any significant change the way the cowardly lion or scarecrow did, they just exist for the sake of nostalgia.",Oz the Great and Powerful
347,Sychaeus,Not the homage it was trying to be,5,17 March 2013,"I went and saw this film with a group of people interested in science fiction and fantasy films. Very few of us enjoyed it. Let's get this out of the way straight up: Oz the Great and Powerful isn't quite a prequel to old films, nor does it fit in with the written canon. I'm not particularly bothered by either of these things- but i do think that other adaptations have made more interesting versions of the story.So, we take the legend of the Wizard of Oz and make a film about one man's journey to some kind of redemption, or enlightenment, at the cost of the happiness of others (in my opinion). Of course, our hero is also fighting for the oppressed, the gentle, and the humorous at the behest of another pretty woman.The film attempts to reference elements of the style of the previous films. A kind of mash up of black and white, 3D and collage aesthetics that works not at all. We get the obligatory, over saturated colours of Oz, though some familiar costuming contrasts with a few more modern choices that, honestly, seemed baffling.The acting left a lot to be desired. I tried to pass some of it off as aping the 1930's idea of the loud and over the top ring master, a kind of stage presence theatricality, but mostly it was just bad. Franco possessed none of the quick talking charisma his character was supposed to embody. Rachel Weisz was the only exception to the rule. The 3D was gimmicky, like most 3D, and whilst some individual animation was nice (the china girl was adorable, and had the best lines in the script) it never really fit together with the live action elements.The plot was what you would expect- some at attempts at humor, but for me, they mostly failed. I feel like the film wasn't sure what it's primary purpose was- make something new, or re-make something old. They caught in a limbo between both options.Overall, an often pretty but always lacking re-hash of a redemption story. I had so hoped for something more enjoyable.",Oz the Great and Powerful
348,fixfireleo,over acted,6,19 March 2013,"In my opinion the movie was great....except for the acting, which kinda drags everything else down. It's REALLY over acted. I have thought back on the original ""Wizard of Oz"" movie and realize that type of over acting was typical of that era, so maybe a conscious decision was made to act in this style, but in this day and age, I just think most people (at least myself) don't like it. Visually the movie was stunning. The transition from black and white to color is a nice throw back to the original. The heavy use of CGI didn't seem overbearing or out of place.The theater I go to only charges $6.50 for 3D movies. It's worth that but if I had paid $15 at the AMC I would have been disappointed.

I look forward to seeing this again and would definitely buy this movie when it comes on sale. I loved every minute from start to finish, truly full of refreshing twists and turns that keep the story from becoming what could have been a predictable ho hum kind of movie. As the story unfolds you will likely find yourself thinking ""Ah ha"", as the storyline from the original production is filled in with the elements and situations this version's characters and story reveal. What could have been a fluff piece with a thin skin (if the acting could not support the plot) instead becomes a truly satisfying first course. You believe the characters and the intentions, (good and evil) they embody. Totally WOW!!",Oz the Great and Powerful
350,dgls_lwsn,A Modern Disney Fairytale,7,23 May 2013,"While ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" certainly continues the evolution of so-called ""children's movies,"" it was a classic Disney fairytale. There was a kingdom - the Land of Oz, there were munchkins, and there were witches and a wizard and a great big pile of gold.However, it seemed as though it might be slightly scarier than the usual Disney movie for younger audiences, what with the frightening witches and shrieking winged-primates, but the plot was classic fairytale action. Many complaints about this movie were ""the plot was predictable."" Of course the plot was predictable - it's a fairytale. If you wanted your wildest expectations denied at every turn, go see Oblivion. Fans of fairytale stories don't read the books or go see the movies because they expect to be shocked by an original, psychologically thrilling scheme. It is the alluring tale of a prince and princess, a king and queen; a dreamy adventure to whisk us away from the monotony of our possibly dreary routine.The land through which Oscar (the wizard, Oz) traveled was brilliantly textured and thought up. It was especially pleasant to behold, and added greatly to the fairytale atmosphere of the movie. There was the classic yellow brick road, the dangerous poppy field, and the wicked dark forest. Along with this, the movie starts in black and white, then transitions into color to emphasize the nature of the fairytale. I found the effect wonderful.James Franco is fantastic as the ""great and powerful wizard,"" while Mila Kunis gives a surprising and vibrant life to her character. In hindsight, the acting seemed a bit cheesy at times, but then again...what does one expect, watching a Disney fairytale? It would have been more surprising, perhaps, to have seen an un-cheesy script (what is the word for ""un-cheesy?"" I've not a clue).I award this movie a 7 out of 10 because on a somewhat troubled night, it provided ample distraction. This is a movie that will satisfy the dreamer's dreams.If you're not a dreamer, I'm not quite sure why you're reading a review about a Disney fairytale. Be gone with you.",Oz the Great and Powerful

The story line is OK, but not original in it's concept. It was though enjoyable if taken as a stand alone movie, some of the scenes are pretty good the twister and the big finale. I was mainly disappointed by the acting of the lead character'Oz' played by James Franco.

The scenes and costumes have modern, contemporary techniques used, as do some of the character lines. The animation of the china doll can take your breath away.

355,saallan09,Oz: Great and Powerful?,8,28 July 2013,"Oz: the Great and Powerful.But is he? Well, yes and no...Disney make some amazing films, that can't be denied. Unfortunately, that can also be their undoing. They coat a particular brand of gloss over their productions that is wonderful when it shines, but is disappointing when it doesn't. With Oz, the shine is definitely there, but in parts, that's the problem.I loved the black and white introduction. The girl Oz is 'sweet' on mentions that a man who's surname is Gale has asked her to marry him. I thought that was a nice touch. An interesting link to the classic original. I wonder, however, what Disney will do if they feel obliged to produce a sequel to this prequel. Any such film must still be a prequel to the first film (which is, I suppose, now a sequel?) as it would genuinely be a bad move to actually remake the Wizard of Oz.With a distinct lack of ideas, so many films are being remade - Total Recall, Fright Night, Evil Dead and many more - but there are those films that simply MUST be left alone. The Wizard of Oz is one such movie. Make a sequel if you will (as has been done - Oz, Return to Oz, The Wiz, The Witches of Oz (!)) but don't touch the original.Please.When Walt Disney was alive, I believe he refused to make a sequel. Now he's no longer with us, it seems most Disney films will have a number 2 or more at some point. In some cases, these are good. In others, not so. The Lion King is one of my favourite animated films. Up there with Finding Nemo (""just keep swimming!""). I was disappointed by the second one, but thought the third was a unique take on sequels. It worked, and was very funny.But what will they do with Oz: The Great and Powerful? They've set the scene, leading into the original nicely. The Gale name is there, linking Dorothy and the Wizard. There's the green Wicked Witch (I thought the transformation here was a little weak, but it does have to cater for the younger audience). And the reason for the smoke and mirrors is established too. As such, there's the potential for a second film to be squeezed in, potentially just because it has the Oz name. Not necessarily a good idea.Anywho, back to the film.Black and white. I thought this was a fitting tribute to the first film. Plus, when Oz arrived in... erm... Oz, the contrast between the monochrome and the stunning colour was amazing. One issue with black and white films nowadays is that they look like a colour film with the colour removed. The definition is still there. It doesn't look like a traditional 'black and white' movie. A little ageing effect here would have, I think, added. Some imperfections to enhance the perfection.Still, the transition from dirty old Kansas to beautiful Oz was seamless and Sam Raimi (who I'm a fan of anyway) has helped make the world a much bigger place than it ever was before. As Oz floats along a river to musical plants and river fairies, you're transported to a wonderful land brought to impressive life. I saw the film in 2D - which would help keep the colour vivid - but there were definitely some parts which were included for the 3D viewers. A fall down a waterfall was effective in 2D, so would have turned stomachs in 3! There was humour mixed nicely in with the shocks and surprises. Finlay, the flying monkey, and his liking of bananas. A Chinatown made from real china pottery. The flying baboon that suddenly appeared, teeth bared (which made me wonder why more wasn't put into the transformation of Theodora - even Roald Dahl's 'The Witches' adaptation had something shown).Sometimes the actors appeared a little uncomfortable in their roles, apart from Zach Braff who seemed perfectly at home as the monkey (lol). The 'Bully' cry of the Tinkers and the 'Not now' fanfare of Nuck felt forced, and the baboons gaining on them in the mist looked scribbled and not actually doing anything (and the fake running of Gelinda?) but these were fairly minor things in retrospect, considering .So, Oz: The Great and Powerful. Was he? Well... Majestic, I think so. Visually impressive, mostly, yes. A nice lead in to the original? Pretty much. It had some excellent parts, some good parts and some OK parts. It had a couple of not so good parts too.But, did I enjoy it? Yes I did. 'Nuff said.",Oz the Great and Powerful

It only uses the original names to give them a new meaning, and that is putting Oz or Oscar in a role as a hero, which the original Wizard had not. It puts Glinda as a weak, good for nothing blondie. I can only remember the words of Louis C.K. while telling his audience about how the Wizard of Oz portrayed women as valuable, courageous and strong beings, and how his daughters could look up to them. This movie destroys all that is good in the original story. It surprises me that people could give this movie more than 2 stars, for not even the especial effects were good enough. The direction is horrible, and makes good actors like Mila Kunis seem like fools on the screen. I don't know much about the other actors stories, but I have the impression that they could have done a lot better, because I believe they didn't reach the place where they are now for only being pretty or something.

360,Clonergan12,The Magic of the Projectionist,7,21 March 2013,"This film itself has rather unconvincing characters and although Kunis and Franco are not the best for the roles that is something that is unchangeable at this point so lets look at what this film set out to do, and how well it did it. This is a story that follows the wizard of Oz before he was the wizard and how he came to power. Since most people have seen the original Wizard of Oz we all know that Oz is a phony, a fraud, and also an asshole. I think that although Franco walked around with the swagger of an adolescent child, this was a good way to develop a character that still has a ways to go since there are to be more of these films.But besides the acting lets look at the important stuff. This movie takes place in the early 1900's where illusionists and magicians were able to make a much better living without all of the bells and whistles that they would need to live in modern day. There were also other people who created a much more astounding type of magic around this time, film and those that project it. They are the kings of the theater and at this time someone who can project a film was a god of sorts. Now this doesn't only speak of innovation in the early 1900's however because when Franco has the (Tinkers?) make his projection machine he creates a few changes that the world had not seen at this time and never would. By using the smoke he was able to give his face a 3rd dimension, yes I am suggesting that this film is speaking directly of the large jump from 2 Dimensional film to 3D or Real D. The original Wizard of Oz had a strong statement towards the revolutionary change from black and white to color much before color would be prominently used. I think this in a way is also a statement about CGI and its development. Although we can create these astounding worlds it doesn't mean we should, we are the gods that control the complete environment of these films now, but that doesn't mean we need to use it. This film is an extremists view of what CGI and 3D can and will be, and right now people don't really like that. But also think back to the time when black and white was the norm, although people embraced and loved The Wizard of Oz, color films didn't really break out for another decade. These films have one purpose and one purpose only, to show us that the world around us is not always as we perceive it.

363,kimgrear,Beautiful yet vapid prequel.,5,9 March 2013,"Beautiful yet vapid prequel to ""The Wizard Of Oz"" that is plague by not only by the numbers script but the questionable judgment of the people behind the scenes of the making of the film. The CGI effects are good and the characters created by those effects are cute but they are not strong enough to hide the films real problems. The script is so by the numbers that you can envision the twist and the ending five minutes into the film. Prequels are generally predicable because it set before the events of a prior movie but this film just did not have any originality to it and was just lazy in its set up. The script is not the only problem here; some of the casting is also off by a large margin as well. James Franco was not the first actor to be considered to play the character of Oscar Diggs but you can see a hundred better actors who could have done the role justice before you can ever think of Franco in the role and he does not disappoint in proving how miscast he is. Franco is terrible, so terrible that he is distracting to the film. He definitely does not care about his performance and it shows. Franco just swaggers in as if he is above the material and the actors around him while in reality, his performance is worse that the script of this film. Making his character so unlikable that you really do not want to watch or care about him. While Franco is in his own little world, Mila Kunis just looks lost in her performance. She is not believable as the wicked witch of the west and just comes across as lightweight compare to her sisters played by Rachel Weisz and Michelle Williams who are both much better actors than this film deserved. Weisz in particular gives the film's best performance because she at least makes an effort with the lazy script she has to work with and just has fun with it. Her character is the typical Disney villain but in Weisz's capable hands, she becomes more and that does translate on screen. You as an audience member are swept off your feet by Weisz's enthusiasm for her role and the movie becomes better off because of it. Williams does the same, making her sweet tooth character a joy to watch as well and brings a real sincerity to the role which is a god sent because of how insincere Franco is in his.It is a beautiful movie and the CGI does not give you a headache but other those things and the efforts of Weisz and Williams, The movie has too many strikes against it thanks to the script and the miscasting of Franco and Kunis.",Oz the Great and Powerful
364,papoe2005,Too much emphasis on visuals...CGI visuals!,4,10 March 2013,"I knew going in this was not in anyway going to live up to the most beloved film of all time; however, I adore the idea of giving us the back story of Oscar, or the Wizard of Oz. I never read the novels and now having seen this film I definitely will, because I want to give my own visual splendor to this story and the book will consist of actual intellectual dialogue.Right off the bat James Franco and Mila Kunis are leading this film so big FAIL right there. I don't dislike them and in fact I really enjoy them as supporting characters like in Pineapple Express and Book of Solomon. But as the top billed actors no thank you and going back to this mythical world that blew my mind as a child I wanted this piece to be so much stronger than what we were given.Sam Raimi is a good director, but the last film I adore of his was The Army of Darkness; the Spiderman trilogy was okay and honestly I wouldn't give them the time of day if not for it's seamless and unintentional hokeyness...plus Bruce Campbell is the man. Which this film needed so much more Bruce Campbell shame on you Raimi, his appearance gave me hope but 5 minutes later he's gone and I was very sad.So the film in a nutshell falls short on progressive storytelling, engaging characters, and even a cohesive plot. I felt rushed and yet very tired; the film lasted 30 minutes too long and yet with a 2 hour running time I still didn't care about anyone on the screen...except China Girl she was adorable and a great character even though they tried to ruin her with some corny clichés and giggles...ugh. But we have Oscar who starts out as an arrogant womanizing con man, okay awesome he's definitely not perfect and he has a morality complex great so we are going to see a major transition with this character by the end...Nope! He's still an asshole at the end. There is the bland and out of left field romance between him and Theodora, which I did not care about but that is suppose to be the driving point to Theodora's downfall, which I didn't care about. And in the end he doesn't even apologize to her for being an asshole...and we are somehow suppose to relate to this guy. He treats his monkey ""friend"" with animosity and it's just cruel. I'm all for a little cynicism and poking fun but he basically made him a servant and his comments were quite insulting, not funny at all. James Franco again is suppose to be arrogant but you need to have some charm to make us relate and care about the character, he lacked any likability and he cheeses like an idiot throughout the whole picture. And don't get me started on his half assed speech near the end it was like a summarization of every lame ass pep talk in every lame ass fantasy ""epic,"" major let down all around.Now the supporting characters played by Zach Braff, Bill Cobbs, Joey King especially, and to an extent Rachel Weisz and Michelle Williams did very well. But Mila Kunis just was not a good pick for this role. Her motivation is lost on me and her weird falling in love with Oscar so suddenly is something out of old Disney animation or a musical it just doesn't connect at all so her desire to become unfeeling to end her pain just seems melodramatic as hell. And the build up to the wicked witch's reveal...I know no one in the rest of the human existence will ever compare to that of Margaret Hamilton...NO ONE EVER!!! But I was willing to believe with such a huge buildup we would have some payoff. No not one bit she was laughable I busted out laughing when her face appeared and her cackle or scream if you will, was just lousy. Mila Kunis I know you were trying it definitely shows, but you lacked direction, the focus and motivation as a character was completely lost on me, and forgive my male mentality but all I saw was green cleavage when you appeared on screen after your transformation.Visually it was quite pleasing the first 20 minutes than I got bored of the CGI, just way too much CGI and someone on this site said it best; it was like Burton's Alice in Wonderland, too much CGI not enough story. Grant it I enjoyed the first 10 minutes with the carnival and the live show was pretty fun. And the clever battle at the end using wits over brawn I enjoyed that; but ultimately that adds up to maybe 20 25 minutes of the film. It just wasn't good and I won't watch it again not even to see if I missed something due to a bad theater experience with the annoying audience members who had to commentate the whole damn time. We need to stop and take a breath and actually put forth genuine effort into these films. I feel like there are 20 new films in a given month and as an avid movie goer I try to watch them all. In February alone I watched 11 or 12 features and only a handful were worthy of my time. Stop producing crap for the sake of making a buck please I beg you this is an art form that should be respected so show it some dignity. And don't headline Franco in a fantasy epic for the love of God do not do that!Thank you.",Oz the Great and Powerful
365,fanofleftdead,Surprisingly Great Movie!,8,7 April 2013,"I just recently saw this movie in theaters with my family. Going in, I knew that it was a prequel and not a remake, but not much else. Right off the bat, I was intrigued and my expectations for the rest of the movie were raised. Afterwards, I realized that not only was it a great family movie; it was extremely enjoyable! The visuals in this movie are stunning, all of the acting was great (James Franco, Michelle Williams and Mila Kunis especially), the script was well-done, and the overall quality of the movie was exceptional. Another thing this movie does is showcase the versatility of the director Sam Raimi. Sam Raimi (who is also known for the ""Spiderman"" and ""Evil Dead"" trilogies) proves he can do anything from gruesome horror flicks to Disney movies; and do them right! If you are on the fence about seeing this movie, I would suggest giving it a chance. For what it is, I loved it and give it 9 out of 10.",Oz the Great and Powerful

I grew up watching the first one and it was brilliant to watch as a child but this new one didn't try to replace it or take anything away from the original, sure you see a cameo if you like of the cowardly lion but nothing really else, I thought the little toy girl was completely hilarious! She totally cracked me up from start to finish. I thought it was an interesting twist to Mila Kunis' character, i'm not a great James Franco fan (his smile annoys the heck out of me lol) but he did well in this too i have to say.If you want to see something that will give you laughs, visually stimulate you then go see this.I'll be watching it again thats for sure!",Oz the Great and Powerful
367,alexis-368-973240,You don't need a balloon to come back to Oz,7,1 April 2013,"I am extremely happy that the Oz saga still lives from the L. Frank Baum books to now. Oz never ends to be appreciated and beloved by a wide audience. In this film, I think that Disney used a lot of nice elements.I would first like to mention the things that Disney kept, such as the sepia in Kansas and color in Oz. Glinda travels by bubble and the Munchkins still break out into song. When I saw these in the movie, I felt nostalgic. I could look back and say, "" I remember when I saw these as a kid.""The characterization was not top-notch, but it could have been a lot worse. The witches already have a story, it's the wizard's you don't know about. I am glad that the focus was mainly on the wizard and not so much on the witches' issues. The witches are already dealt with in the book and musical Wicked. In my opinion, the character development in Wicked is better than Oz: The Great and Powerful, but maybe that's just because the characters in Wicked meant a lot more to me.The casting didn't bother me. James Franco looks like the Wizard even without the top hat. His facial expressions bring out the ""wizard"" in him. I was also relieved to have strong female actresses that didn't play wimpy and helpless witches who don't know what to do with their kingdom, especially with Glinda. In fact, I liked Glinda because she was just a plain cool person in every way throughout the film. There's no doubt: she's always good.The costumes and visual effects are amazing too. It is worth the extra bucks seeing it in 3-D. Some of the witches' dresses and hats blew me away as well.No Oz story is perfect, though. The wizard could have learned his lesson a little earlier. The movie is two hours, so I didn't want to wait one hour and fifty minutes for the wizard to finally get it. I would have rated the movie 9 or 10 stars if that had been touched on.I recommend this to all Oz fans because it is not only a good, but a GREAT movie.",Oz the Great and Powerful

Like Jack the Giant Slayer, I wasn't sure whether it was meant for children or adults. Unlike Jack the Giant Slayer, this one made use of its amazing graphics, instead of being an excuse for them. I would like to have seen more development of the wicked witch. She's given so little time to regress. Also, these re-made fairy tales need to make up their minds about who their demographic is. That aside, I enjoyed the movie. It was a fun adventure. The special effects showcase the land of Oz as would be seen from a traveler's perspective, but the movie wasn't a foil for its own graphics.

This is similar to Jack the Giant Slayer in its weak and clichéd story. I am no longer surprised to see a movie like this receiving the green light. Sam and the actors should be embarrassed. From the start, when Francoe enters the film we see the film is overly dramatized. I felt at times I was watching a theater performance. All the actors except Michelle Williams pushed it too far and Mila Kunis was a joke. The tears and the witch look were laughable. The people of Oz lacked any of the enchantment from the actual Wizard of Oz film. That was a tough two hours.

I saw The Wizard of Oz many times in my life and saw Wicked in the theater. That being said, I feel that this will become an instant classic - it really is that good!My family got lucky and got to see a preview of the film last night. Got there over an hour before it started and was one of the last to get in... whew! (Didn't think that many would show up that early... lol) In either case we are SO very happy that we went! Disney did an excellent job in taking the original story and backing it up many years (it begins in 1905, which if you take The Wizard of Oz showed, this would have been 34 years earlier). Without going into detail, I feel that it was very well acted - especially 'Oz', Glinda, Elanora, Theodora and even many of the 'smaller parts', the voices of animated characters, Finley, the China Girl and more. I also feel it was well written, making it very easy to really care about the characters as they develop during the show.If you even mildly enjoyed The Wizard of Oz, you REALLY want to go see this movie, trust me on this. I have never felt 2+ hours pass so quickly, making me wonder if the running time was wrong. (I forgot my watch and had to leave my cell phone in my car for the preview). As we left and I checked the time, the running time was accurate (of course). The story was so engaging that I just lost track of the time.We brought our son and his friend and after watching the film both of them now want to watch the original film again. Yep, 2 'tweens' now want to watch a film created over 70 years ago. Great job Disney!",Oz the Great and Powerful
371,donthedragonwilson999,Don't listen to the bad reviews about the casting,7,9 March 2013,"I really don't know where those reviewers came from under mine but when I saw this movie today I thought the best thing about it was the nice casting. Especially the performances by Mila Kunis and yes, James Franco.Franco was funny, entertaining and a perfect choice for the main character, who is not a great hero, but a trickster and a human being...okay, he's an a$$hole but if you enjoyed Bruce Campbell's ""hero"" in Army Of Darkness you won't be disappointed. On the other hand Kunis also did a great job as the good/bad witch. She was totally believable as a young version of Margaret Hamilton thanks to her her voice and mimicry. She was fun to watch. Rachel Weisz was also strong as Evanora but not THAT amazing/fantastic/stunning as everyone says while Michelle Williams was solid but forgettable. I guess it's because of her not so exciting character. The other members of the crew also did a good job so don't listen to the negative reviews about the casting.

373,lucasscott-jh,A wonderful journey to the land of Oz that pays homage to the original. Enjoyed every minute!,10,12 June 2013,"I was very surprised to see the negative reviews on this movie. I thought it was beautifully written and led by a strong cast. I was intrigued from beginning to end. It is amazing how a story like this was created well over a half a century after the original timeless classic. I loved Michelle Williams as Glinda the good witch, she fit the role perfect. I also rather enjoyed the back story on the wicked witch and her transformation. If you watch close there are several references to the original. The black and white scenes in Kansas and full color in Oz, Michelle William's other character Annie's mention of a marriage proposal from a John Gale ( Dorothy's last name is Gale in the original ), a tornado sending the wizard to Oz in a hot air balloon, flying monkeys, Glinda's wand, poppy flowers, and perhaps my favorite when the wicked witch cries the tears burn her skin ( in the original the wicked witch melts when a bucket of water is thrown on her). I also enjoyed seeing James Franco in this role and I think he did a great job. I would definitely recommend watching this movie to anyone and making your own decision of whether you like it or not. For me it makes a great companion to the original. P.S. To all you Wizard of Oz fans out there may I also recommend the Sy Fy series "" Tin Man"". A Sci-fi twist on the original.",Oz the Great and Powerful
374,james-mousetm,Slightly Entertaining,5,16 July 2013,"I had really high hopes for this movie when I first saw the previews.However, after watching it, I can say it was nothing worth the hype. I'm normally a fan of a couple of the ""A-List"" actors in this movie, but everything was over exaggerated in the context of acting.Thanks to modern CG, I will say the graphics and colors were awesome, and it certainly gave a good child-like impression of what Oz would be like if it was a real place.They really rushed the plot. It felt like we were getting introduced to characters and when we finally reached the main plot twist, it was over.Nothing special here.",Oz the Great and Powerful
375,heidirst,Oz the Arrogant and Sleezy,3,1 October 2013,"The main problem with Oz the Great and Powerful is the main character, Oscar, is ultimately unlikable. We are introduced to him as a magician who takes more than his fair share of the proceeds, is flippant with his helpers, and is constantly winning over women through lies and deception.Oscar gets some credit when his long-term sweetheart appears. She's been offered a proposal in marriage, and she came to get his thoughts. He tells her to accept the proposal as he believes she deserves better than him. But this otherwise applaudable moment is brought down with the girl's insistence that she believes he could be better if he wanted to be. The fact that she knows all of his dirty secrets and still wants to be with him because she believes he could be better is too reminiscent of women in abusive relationships.Due to Oscar's nature with women, an unhappy boyfriend appears to rip him limb from limb. Oscar escapes by getting into a hot air balloon that is sucked into a tornado that takes him to Oz. Once there, he discovers a prophecy about a wizard coming to Oz from a far away land who will save the kingdom from the wicked witch. Naturally, everyone believes Oscar is this man.This is supposed to be a redemption story, but the main flaw is Oscar hardly shows any changes. Oscar starts his journey in the land of Ozwith the same greedy, womanizing nature he's had the whole beginning of the movie, fully taking advantage of whom the people believe him to be. About halfway through the movie Oscar finally meets up with Glinda who sees him for exactly who he is and isn't afraid to let him know it. Glinda knows he's a fraud, but she also knows the people believe in him, and she knows belief can go a long way. She convinces Oscar to help her rally the people so they can be led against the wicked witch to take back the throne.Glinda and Oscar work together, and when he has the chance to chicken out he sticks it through, and he even manages to make some friends. Things turn around for him, and this is the place where his character-changing redemption should come through, but ultimately it falls flat because of a certain wicked witch.When Oscar arrives in Oz, he meets a young witch named Theodora. She believes him to be the prophesized wizard and is excited to take him to Emerald City. On the way, Oscar wins her over and, according to some online speculation, may even sleep with her. After one night of meeting this man, Theodora is convinced the two of them are going to spend the rest of their lives together. This is very awkward for Oscar since of course he wasn't intending on anything but playing her. He does nothing to disillusion her however, and brushes the whole thing off with the notion that she'll forget all about him once he gets as far away from her as possible.Later, Theodora's sister, Evanora (and current caretaker of the Emerald City), lies to Theodora and alludes that Oscar had spent that night with her. Theodora is crushed, and in a moment of anguish, Evanora convinces Theodora to curse herself so that all the pain she is feeling (along with all the goodness in her) will go away. Theodora agrees, and as her heart is ""withered away,"" she becomes the Wicked Witch of the West.It is hinted that Theodora had some wickedness in her to begin with, but all we see of it is one instance where she gets angry and lets a fire ball lose. This does not exemplify wickedness, just a girl who has trouble controlling her emotions. Ultimately, Theodora is characterized in near complete innocence. Her transformation can be seen as pure manipulation on the part of Oscar and Evanora. And that's why the redemption story doesn't work.Theodora's transformation from an innocent young woman to the wickedest witch there ever lived is not endearing to Oscar. Regardless of other factors, he is at least in part responsible for what happened to her. He chose to play with the delicate feelings of a naïve girl and then cast her aside(as he has done with countless other women), and he never owns up to this fact. The movie may end with him making friends and becoming a generally more likable person, but the fact that he puts the moves on Glinda at the end of the movie just reinforces the sinking feeling that he ultimately changed very little from his time in Oz.The movie neglects to do the frame story where Oscar would wake up and realize he had been dreaming and that all the key people in his life had been in the dream. If the movie had done this, a lot could have been accomplished in the way of his redemption. Perhaps he goes after his sweetheart (whose double is Glinda in Oz), or apologizes to his working partner (who doubles as the monkey he befriends) for treating him so horribly. He could even own up to the women he's been manipulating, which would show an understanding of how his womanizing actions were wrong.Without the frame story, we don't ultimately see how Oscar learns from his experience in Oz. He changes, yes, and grows. But has he truly become a different man, one the audience can like? Does he truly embody ""goodness"" as Glinda claims? Does he become the ""great man"" the people of Oz were looking for and the audience was expecting by the end of the movie? The ultimate answer is no. The movie does have some good elements, but the redemption story is too week for those elements to follow through. And that's why the movie falls on its face. Its namesake simply doesn't hold.",Oz the Great and Powerful
376,grinen-barret,Mila Kunis can't act this type of roll,5,3 April 2014,"Great effects. Jame can pull anything off with is smile. Mila.... No, i was actually feeling embarrassed just watching her performance in this movie. She doesn't play a woman who is madly in love and lost control over her heart.... What the hell Hollywood? You need someone to pick out cast for you? I'm available... Kunis is highly independent, and will end up with a man who she only shares intimate moments with and little of anything else in life. Sure she could change that, but thats who she is right now. She isn't going to pull off being madly in love with anyone. She is to vain, and cares too much about what her boyfriend looks like to give us a sense that she could really invest her heart into the spiritual nerve centers of love. These mismatched roles come unexpected though sometimes. For instance, Jhonny Depp in WONKA... He always plays the roles of an oddball, and you think he would be just the guy for WONKA, but his performance in that particular instance was a bit too unsettling. It was playing ""odd"", in such an awkward way that it didn't even feel right. Christopher Walken was the right guy for WONKA.",Oz the Great and Powerful
377,Drakeluvr,What was Disney THINKING?!,5,6 March 2013,"While the visuals of this film are in step with it being a masterpiece, I'd like to know what Disney was thinking asking someone who is known for horror movies doing a 'family' film.The acting was a disaster as Franko's interaction with any actress that he was supposed to be flirting with seemed forced. It is also NOT Disney to have a 'prince' blatantly cheating on a 'princess'. Even in the Little Mermaid, Prince Eric was under a spell and in the Pirates series, Will stayed true to Elizabeth even though Elizabeth 'cheated' on him by tricking Jack so that the crew can get away, leaving Jack with the ship.In Pirates, you EXPECT clothes to be ripped off, NOT in Oz. I thought it was in poor taste that Theodora began tearing her dress off as she became the Wicked Witch. This is a CHILDREN'S STORY! I think that if Walt Disney were alive today, he'd be horrified that his name was associated with this.Whoever did the costume design also didn't do their research very well because this film was SUPPOSED to be set in the early 1900s. In the early 1900s women did NOT wear pants, and Theodora is in pants for at least 15 minutes of the film.If this movie was in line with how L. Frank Baum wrote the Wizard, I've read all the books, and there are more ways to show that the wizard is a con man then having him flirt with every female in sight.

It's not that the film is terrible; it's just not as good as it could or should have been. The computerized visual effects in ""Oz"" are more cartoony than necessary, most likely so the makers could maintain the fanciful, not-quite-lifelike tone of ""Wizard."" Unfortunately, the characters and storytelling in ""Oz"" don't keep pace with the visuals.

I think the sexy witches are a joke- I would have forgiven that if it came even close to the original Wicked Witch in voice, face, anything! There were positives, though. Some genuinely laugh-out-loud moments between the main character and the monkey. Lots of great animation effects, but in the end it was like opening a gorgeously wrapped Christmas gift, only to find a ratty Santa sweatshirt inside. Good try, but disappointing.For my money, I would have loved to see this movie take a chance on some unknown actors who fit the characters a little better. I just couldn't take Theodora seriously (or the other ones for that matter). I kept saying to myself, ""Hey, that girl (Michelle Williams) just played Marilyn Monroe! What the heck is she doing here?""Even my 10-year-old daughter would have pointed out the final blow to this movie's chance of being worth the money- WHERE ARE THE RUBY SLIPPERS???

There is wonderful, colourful scenery beyond in the land of Oz, but the blue-screening and CGI still fails to disguise the blandness... The turning point, however, is the arrival of Franco's second companion (who goes on to steal every moment in which she appears), in the films most touching scene. From that point on I enjoyed Oz the Great and Powerful immensely.The feelings towards Oz are very mixed. People and critics think it was miscast, Weisz stole the show, Franco and Kunis were poor...and so on... ...Such hogwash seems misplaced. Weisz does alright, as do the rest - but then, I didn't go expecting a sequel/prequel to rival the Godfather Part 2...Perhaps people thought Oz should have been released sooner so it and its cast would be giving Daniel Day-Lewis and Lincoln a run for its money at the Oscars...Who knows...Take Oz for what it is. That it was ever going to be more is merely a delusion... ...Because what Oz is is a great entertaining illusion telling the story of a great illusion.",Oz the Great and Powerful
381,offbased,"There is a lot to admire here, too bad a couple of bad casting decisions and a flimsy story almost ruins the party.",6,11 February 2013,"Sam Raimi's excursion into the Land of Oz is somewhat of a sight to behold, with great sets and wonderful use of CGI that does not over power the senses or your cinematic tastes. Too bad for this film, bad casting decisions on two of the characters and a way too simplistic story sets it back somewhat. Raimi does not throw up too many computerize affects and a great deal of Oz is old school charm with grand sets and costuming. That benefits this film greatly and makes Oz a real cinematic treat. The performances are for the most part spot on with great turns by Rachel Weisz (Weisz has the most fun in her role) Michelle Williams, who gives a noble performance as Glenda the good witch and the third best belongs to the voice over of Zach Braff, who gives a funny performance as a talking monkey sidekick. With these performances and Raimi's technical savvy, the film almost takes off, almost. What keeps it from being any better is the story, which is fine but flimsy and predicable. Yes, it is a sort of prequel and you know what is going to happen but there are no surprises to be found here and most of the so-called surprises are ruined thanks to the marketing if you have been following this movie. Another factor that keeps this movie from soaring to better heights is some of the other casting, which is baffling to say the least. Mila Kunis is disappointing as the younger sister Theodora, who of course becomes the Wicked Witch of the West. No flare in her part and just looks miserable through out the entire film. The biggest casting violation is James Franco who comes across as sleepy and somewhat creepy as the main character Oscar (Oz). He overacts in some parts and under acts in others and is with out a doubt the weakest member of the cast.While there is a lot to admire with this film, the problems it has (Mainly the story and the miscasting of Kunis and Franco) keep it from achieving a better grade from me.B-",Oz the Great and Powerful
382,Footserve,"Has its moments but outside of Sam Raimi's strong directorial efforts and Rachel Weisz's fun and wickedly sassy performance, the movie plays more like a Star Wars prequel.",5,18 February 2013,"Mildly entertaining look at the origins of the characters from 'The Wizard of Oz"" has everything down pack. From great visuals to imaginative set pieces, this film has everything. Its does not have however a single interesting character outside of the film's main villain and her good witch sister. Not to mention the fact that its script is as thin as a sheet of paper and the plot reeks of a Star Wars prequel but with out the light sabers. Its main hero Oscar Diggs (Played by James Franco) is not interesting at all and it does not help matters that Franco is miscast and while Oscar is supposed to be a bit of a conman with a heart; Franco comes across more as a degenerate deviant with his performance. While Franco is sputtering out of control performances wise, it falls on his co-stars to pick up his slack and one of them is Rachel Weisz, who plays the oldest witch sister Evanora, who rules Oz with a velvet iron glove. She is manipulative and cunning and in my mind the best thing about this film. While most of the things in this film are mostly kids stuff, Weisz infuses her character with a wickedly sassy seductive charm that elevates this film past most of its problems. Her showmanship with the material is greatly appreciated, especially when after a while; you are getting quite annoyed with most of the characters in this movie, especially the computer generated ones. Another actor who picks up Franco's slack is Michelle Williams, who is very charming in a good girl kind of way and is the only actor in the film who can hold the screen with Weisz performance wise. The movie could have worked much better if it just had Weisz and Williams as the leads but unfortunately, its not and we have to suffer though Franco trying to be charming in a squirmy kind of way and suffer though probably the movie's worse offense, which is the character of Theodora played by Mila Kunis, who redefines the word ""Miscast"". Theodora is supposed to be innocent in this film and gradually lose her innocence to become (Spoiler) the iconic ""Wicked Witch of the West"". Unfortunately, Mila comes across as interesting as a block of wood in this film and her transformation towards the climax ends up being more funny in a very bad sort of way than revealing. It does not help matters that Mila looks as disinterested in her character as the audience is and a better actor with more range could have brought more to it.All and all, it had its moments but its problems weight it down.",Oz the Great and Powerful

Overall, this movie moved at a pace that kept your attention but offered little more in the way of entertainment. It wasn't until the latter part of the story that a realization appeared portraying the wizard as more that a coward, con-artist & cheat when he had an epiphany when he realizes he can make a difference simply using the tools he already has with magic & misdirection. His illusions give him the ability to gain the upper hand and save OZ. Mila Kunis in the beginning is suggested to be a ""witch"" yet her characterization is shaped as one with interest in the welfare & goodness of the people of the city of OZ. Only when her sister is presented in the storyline is there some suggestion Mila is something more. This story is good for a new audience, but offers little to fans of the original story and would be better served if the title didn't suggest its affiliation to an existing franchise.",Oz the Great and Powerful
385,jeremiahgood,If you liked Burton's Alice in Wonderland you will love this...not a GOOD thing!,2,8 March 2013,"Oz the Great and Powerful 2 stars out of 10(in 3D) This film falls so flat on so many levels. Putting it even in the same breath with the classic Wizard of Oz should be cause for a house to fall out of the sky. I notated the 'in 3D' because I doubt seeing it in 2D would give the grand scope of the film that really is the only reason it got the extra star. While it has MANY ""cheap 3D tricks"" seeing Oz in 3D does make it feel like the magical place Baum described as in his classic books. The real stars of this film are the people behind the computers that created Oz as a land. Below in descending order is my take on the cast of Oz.-Michelle Williams steals the slippers as Glinda no matter how many times she had to say poorly written lines she pulled them off and really kept the movie going. But even with her ability to steal every scene she was it, she alone could not make up for the rest of the cast. -Mila Kunis portrays Theodora very much as the same doe eyed pretty, but not to bright, character she has in many of her other roles. To try and be as spoiler free as possible, once the movie really starts going her acting was no where near enough out weigh the bad CG. -Rachel Weisz plays a very forgettable Evanora which is sad because her character I felt had the most to add to the film. She played the ""wicked"" part very well but in the end just seemed to be lost in the shuffle. -Zach Braff as Finley the winged monkey and Joey King as the China Girl were both comic relief and the annoying children characters that almost all family movies now a days have to have. Zach voices Finley as he did with Chicken Little and that is to say not at all. He plays the part of the sidekick to Oz but in the end is more of just a banana peel, that is to say when a gag needs to happen there he is. Joey as China Girl starts as the heart of the film, but by the end seems to be more of the spoiled whining child that is begging for attention. -The land of Oz and its many inhabitants all play such a minor role you can forget if you are in Oz or Wonderland. This I feel mostly comes from the lawyers and what can and can't be part of this Oz film. Apparently the lawyers went so far as to make sure Disney could not even use the same color green for the Wicked Witch of the West, so you can imagine how many changes had to be done to make sure the audience forgets the original Wizard of Oz film ever flew over the rainbow. But despite what could and couldn't be used, what Ozens they were able to sneak in would have been better left out. - Finally we come to James Franco as The Great and Powerful Oz... while I don't think Johnny Deep or Robert Downey Jr, who were both said to have been up for the role, could have saved this film they could not have done any worse! James Franco seems to have a on/off switch when it comes to acting and unfortunately this falls into one of his off times. While I will admit there are times were you really can see him being the circus magician trying to pull off the biggest con ever as being the Wizard, when it boils down to it the biggest con is how he will help pull in millions of dollars with this movie and its inevitable sequels to come. If you like James Franco in most of the films he has been in you will enjoy him in this, but if you haven't well you know what you are getting into.Will this movie do great in the box office? Of course it will, on paper it has so much going for it. Will it be a classic? NOT A CHANCE! This movie was written for 2013 and to set up the sequel in 2015 and get a few theme park attractions out of it and sell TONS of merch. The Wizard of Oz is a classic because it is written as a timeless piece, this is written so kids will laugh at silly little things and parents will enjoy it for the 2+ hours, walk out and have to buy the merch for their kids. As I said in the summary, if you liked with Burton did to Wonderland than you will love what Raimi does to Oz.",Oz the Great and Powerful
386,Whowantsliquor,Faithful both to the book series and the 1939 film!,10,5 March 2013,"I recently got a ticket to an advance screening from my university campus, and after seeing it, I have to say I really enjoyed the movie! It was actually a lot better than I expected in terms of story and character development. I knew the visuals were going to be gorgeous, and they definitely were. The production was grand, and you can tell a lot of the sets were built and not CGI'd (though there were still a lot of CGI usage in the film). It was definitely a very colorful movie with beautiful scenery, especially during the bubble ride. I love that the movie took liberties to make nods to the 1939 film, especially with the black and white in the beginning, and the transition into color (and the change into a wider aspect ratio). Many of the scenes also look familiar to the 1939 film, like the dark forest, the field of sleepy flowers, and the forest where Dorothy met the Cowardly Lion (a very nice cameo BTW). Very clever allusions to the original film without infringing upon copyrights. The movie did a great job in laying down the groundwork to the story of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. Character development was not lacking, surprisingly. You can tell a lot of efforts were put into crafting these characters and molding them into the characters that we have all known so well, especially with Oscar and Theodora. Regarding the new characters, I loved Finley the monkey. He had the audience laughing the entire movie, and he was the most adorable thing. China girl was also a great addition. A young and spunky little creature with the most heart wrenching scenes in the film. Of course Michelle Williams and Rachel Weisz were amazing in their roles, but I also felt that Franco and Kunis did a wonderful job with their characters, as well. I feel like the critics only hated their performances so much because they came in ready to hate on them, since the two are more well known for their comedic roles, and cannot be taken seriously in an epic fantasy film like this. I thoroughly enjoyed them and what they brought to the table, though. All in all, this was a highly enjoyable family film, and the audience at my screening even clapped at the end. I definitely was not disappointed, and if you are a fan of the 1939 film, I think you will like this movie a lot, as well. This was much better than Alice in Wonderland, which was predictable and dry, in my opinion. The audience is in for a few pleasant surprises in this major release.",Oz the Great and Powerful
387,Patrick-926,A True Disney classic .... (I hope they do a 2nd movie),9,24 March 2013,"A True Disney classic. I thought the special effect were very well done. I saw it in IMAX, you really should see it in 3D. I normally don't like 3D movies but this done very well. And they really shot the movie with ""in your face"" live action. I really hope they do a followup. A 2nd movie, they left the plots in the story open. And they have all the character's background stories in place. I think it would be better than the 1st. Good job Disney, nicely done with all the tie ins from the original story/movie. Good job James, you did a great job as a carnival wizard and out conning the witches. Also loved Mila's performance as Theodora, she nailed it. (Poor meg can't get a break) Love the movie! Go See It! @L@",Oz the Great and Powerful
388,divefanatic,Most magical movie I've seen for while now,8,5 October 2013,"I strongly recommend watching this movie. There's a good plot line. The special effects make Oz feel like a truly magical and awe inspiring world. The movie will bring a range of emotions making you laugh in parts and sad in others. I haven't felt as fully absorbed in a movie in years as I did with Oz the Great and Powerful.The only weaknesses were some of the actors like Franco and Kunis (who I usually like but not in this movie). Their acting was OK if not fantastic - not so bad that it can ruin your experience. Also, although I loved the world created by the special effects, I felt the green witch looked cartoonish. But you don't see that look for long anyway.I really hope they make a sequel.",Oz the Great and Powerful

The camera work at the beginning of the OZ's introduction to the Land of Oz, the banter of Zach Braff as Finley the monkey, and the capture of the colourful nature of the land of oz.However, poor dialogue and awful casting decisions hold this film back. Mila Kunis was embarrassingly bad in this film. I have never noticed her in previous roles whether for the good or bad, but she so clearly does not belong in this picture. Franco has his moments, but seems aloof and disengaged through much of the film. Michelle Williams, Braff, and Weiss are the clear stars of this film.Is it worth watching? Maybe, but definitely a rental.",Oz the Great and Powerful
390,chrisenhall,Revamped interpretation of the quirky and alien land of Oz we all know and love!,6,17 May 2013,"Director Sam Raimi (Spider Man Trilogy) takes us back to the wonderful land of Oz, except since the release of the timeless classic The Wizard of Oz in 1939, 74 years of technological gimmicks have happened and Raimi features these in a revamped interpretation of the quirky and alien land of Oz we all know and love. Oz, the Great and Powerful is a tale set in 1905 in Kansas which follows Oscar Diggs (James Franco, 127 Hours), a small time traveling magician who is accidentally swept away to the land of Oz by a great tornado where he meets three witches Theodora (Mila Kunis, Black Swan), Evanora (Rachel Weisz, The Mummy) and Glinda (Michelle Williams, My Week with Marilyn). Oscar is catapulted with no choice into the land of Oz, and drawn to it's epic problems and inhabitants. He must face the great challenge of convincing the people of Oz that he is, the great and powerful wizard of Oz.If you ask me, The Wizard of Oz (1939) wasn't in dire need of a revisit. How can you top something as organic as Judy Garland and those ruby slippers in the 1939 classic? Although I was reluctant to see this film, in utter fear that this new chapter would hack to pieces my fond childhood memories of losing myself in the land of Oz, by the end of the film I was mildly satisfied with what I had seen. The opening scene introduces you to dry and bleak Kansas, and similar to The Wizard of Oz the entire time spent here is filmed in black and white. Upon meeting Oscar (Franco), we learn he is not only a magician but also a professional con artist who is full of greedy intent. As handsome as Franco is, it's evident perhaps he wasn't the best choice for this role. Franco comes across as somewhat sleazy and creepy with his bad boy attitudes which was increasing my reluctance to watch on.The film takes a great turn when also similar to the original classic, a great tornado approaches. This is where you really get to witness the power of special effects and modern day 3-D technology. The tornado is roaring loud over Kansas and sweeps Oscar away in a hot air balloon, he is taken on a journey through the tornado; arrows and brooms dart out at you which appeared to be 'jumping out' of the screen, it is impressive use of 3-D technology. The storm settles and the film changes to vibrant colour, this is the moment where my shoulders are able to relax and I have hope this could be a decent film. We see the land of Oz as if we were in it ourselves, Oscar's hot air balloon is riding smoothly through the sky, past the mountains, the glistening ponds and sky and over fields of magnificent flowers. It's impossible to know where to look, it's a combination of flora which is jaw droopingly beautiful. This is an 'aha moment' for me because my eagerness to see the revamped land of Oz is fulfilled,Unfortunately the film still has a further 90 minutes to go and I shortly realise upon being introduced to the other characters, this is turning into a bland film and my hopes of a decent film are squashed. The storyline moves into a very conventional fairy tale style which was disappointing because it lacked the same sass and attitude The Wizard of Oz had, it's almost as if this story was too safe, too predictable and too boring. Lately, many much great family films have been released with something subtle to offer the adult audience, sadly this film did not. This film is very 'child friendly' with minimal to 'read between the lines' type features. Oz, the Great and Powerful has a spectacular set and not the storyline to match.When the final credits were rolling and I was evaluating the greatest moment of this film, it was apparent to me the most memorable experience was only 30 minutes in, and once I had adjusted to the initial excitement of Sam Raimi's land of Oz, I became disengaged. My advice is to go and see this film with little expectations because as you probably have assumed I went with very high expectations, and some of those expectations weren't met. If you love the The Wizard of Oz as much as I do, go and see this film simply to gawk at the fantastic revamp of the scenery, the experience to the see the land of Oz in 3-D technology and of course, to witness it on the big screen. If you are looking for a modern day film that is going to top the original film, save yourself the $20 admission and wait to rent the DVD because it appears The Wizard of Oz is still unbeatable!",Oz the Great and Powerful
391,fullbodytransplant,Perhaps the worst screenplay of all time.,1,8 March 2013,"I don't remember being so completely disappointed by a movie in my life. Tired boring tropes abound in the land of Oz. Cliché' storyline, with inane jokes and situations. Truly offensive dialogue, insulting the intelligence of viewers of all ages. I am glad the premiere was moved earlier than midnight, since we were falling asleep before we left Oz.The special effects are lazy and familiar. The sappy costumes and creepy faces are disgusting. This film actually takes a classic movie and ruins it for the masses. I guess they were trying to reach the lowest common denominator of modern audiences. Oz, the ""great and powerful"" is the essence of stupidity. It is mediocre and weak.Horrible, horrible writing. Save your money for anything else.",Oz the Great and Powerful
392,sam-hall123,Oz The Weak and Pitiful - go watch Wicked instead,2,18 March 2013,"Sam Raimi's adventure into the legendary land of Oz is visually very impressive and offers some moments of eye-candy. But this is all quickly over-thrown by James Francos rather terrible portrayal of the iconic character of the Wizard of Oz. He manages to turn a con-man trying to become a better person and make a difference to the world, into a sleazy, unlikeable, gold-digger who will use any opportunity he can to make money.However, Franco is not the only offender of horrible acting, Mila Kunis's portrayal of Theodora is one-dimensional and actually quite boring to watch on-screen. I think looks over talent were used while casting this role.This prequel to the unforgettable story of the Wizard of Oz completely ignores and over-rights the events of THE ACTUAL PREQUEL to Oz, which is the musical Wicked. The musical explains the origin of each of the characters and how they came to be who they are. Wicked is also based very closely on the original works of L. Frank Baum, so is immediately a more accurate representation of the characters origins. Raimi's Oz makes NO SENSE in the context of Baums original work, and even negates and messes up the Wizard of Oz itself! There are very few redeeming factors about this movie, but Rachel Weisz's Evanora is like a breath of fresh air after watching Franco and Kunis pathetically try to act, and Zach Braffs monkey character of Finley is fantastic at offering some comic relief in the film. But unfortunately, these two valiant efforts are not enough to out-weigh the bad points, and do not bring the film any higher than a 4/10.I'm sure this film is great for children and young families these days, but it would be much more beneficial for them to spend a little bit more and go and see the musical production of Wicked, as it has some fantastic acting, catchy songs, fun for everyone and is actually true to Baum's original works.",Oz the Great and Powerful
393,seanoff,Nicely done,7,11 August 2013,"Surprising, thankfully.After watching countless films over the past year or so, I've come to the conclusion that most firm can be surprisingly good if not predictable. However, during the first five minutes I was bugged with the predictable assumption that this was going to be another pathetic niche attempt at film. After seeing The Wolverine, Despicable Me 2, and several others, my hopefuls for this year, Hollywood was over for me. And then this film proved no different, at least at first. I was mortified that Disney, the very essence of innocence's could cast a chauvinistic, narcissistic, womanizing conster as the main character in this film.Disney, what were you thinking? I was horrified that this portrayal was what they were dishing out to the next generation. And then, about 15 minutes in, the monkey said a line that summed up the whole movie. Congratulations, Disney, that was a line that had me in stitches. Nice surprise, all forgiven. From then on in a superb film, a true sign that a d*ckhead can overcome his nature (I presume that was the message). Very well done. I'd recommend this film to anyone. Well cast, animated, acted and executed. I've yet to come across a Disney film that doesn't create a lasting and fulfilling glimpse of an illusion as this oen, bravo on that count. Great entertainment.Enjoy it for what it is :)",Oz the Great and Powerful
394,thelimelightfilmco,A good family watch,8,24 March 2013,"Director: Sam Raimi Starring: James Franco, Michelle Williams, Rachel Weisz, Mila Kunis Length: 130 minutes It's always a bit of a gamble if you do a sequel or prequel to a classic film and even more of a gamble if you leave it for 74 years before you make that follow up film but I have to say from a small child I always wondered exactly how the Wizard of Oz, mortal though he was, actually got to be in Oz and attain his position.Now my wonderment has been satisfied ! So was it worth the wait ? Victor Fleming's classic The Wizard of Oz (1939) was indeed a classic and so it was with some intrepidation that I attended the screening of this prequel from Director Sam Raimi. Oz the Great and Powerful tells the story of Oscar Diggs known as Oz, a con man and circus magician who is transported in a hot air balloon via tornado to a strange and mystical land that is strangely also called Oz. He is here thought to be the long awaited saviour of the land who prophecy had decreed would return to defeat the wicked witch of the west. He meets three witches in Oz.Theodora,Evanora and Glinda His character failings lead him to making a powerful enemy of once good witch Theodora (Mila Kunis) who in modern times would be the girl you didn't want to meet on a speed dating night out ! Within three minutes she wants to be his Queen and is so put out at his lack of sincerity that she plumps for a life on the dark side and a permanently green complexion.We all have issues I guess. He also makes an enemy of Evanora (Rachel Weisz) just by existing,as she's the wicked witch,until Theodora loses the plot anyway, and is therefore fearful of his appearance full stop. The final witch he meets is Glinda (Michelle Williams) who looked so much like an ex- girlfriend of mine in this,that I was enchanted just by her very look.The fact that she was the good witch and a handy adversary for our hero (James Franco) just made me buy into her character more. Despite the fact that Oscar's so-called powers are merely stage magic tricks he attempts to defeat evil and become the chosen King of Oz. Franco is as usual both charming and convincing and it's interesting to watch as his character develops from a womanising waster into a hero and role model for any aspiring wizard.Franco's character carries the film and it's lucky that Franco has both the charm and talent to carry it perfectly. The remainder of the cast compares well, with Michelle Williams managing against the odds to prevent Glinda from appearing overly sweet and sickly, despite her innocence and good nature. There's a pantomime feel about some scenes and some are cheesy,but for me,it just added to the magic being portrayed. The cinematography is wonderful.The CGI never looks out of place and the change from black and white to colour is reminiscent of Fleming's version. Disney are unable to install their film as a prequel to Fleming's, since the rights are owned by Warner Bros, hence no appearance of ruby slippers. Oz the Great and Powerful instead stands as a prequel to the original book series written by L Frank Baum, but this has not been publicised so well. This family adventure is well put together and can be enjoyed by both parents and children alike.It's a great feat when this can be achieved and despite my misgivings on Disney (the commercial franchise) their film department should be very proud of this film.",Oz the Great and Powerful

Creature design is also kind of cool.Cons: Mila Kunis (Rest of the movie) Cinematography (It's Sam Raimi, what did I expect) Make-up/Costumes (Someone really likes sequins) The script was weak. And finally, James Franco's acting. Usually, he's a great actor, but this? This was painful to watch.(Bonus con! Danny Elfman's 30 second musical number that somehow manages to marginalize the elderly, the poor, and individuals with dwarfism in, again, 30 seconds)Basically, the solid visual effects work raises this from a 3 to a 5.

397,Carly1985,"Go for the visuals, not for the plot",8,10 March 2013,"'Oz - the Great and Powerful' is a worthwhile movie to see in theatres, mostly for the visual experience. Great cinematography, beautiful colours and 3d effects make it enjoyable, but some bad casting and writing take away from the film. The overall story is good, but there are some issues I had with it. 1) Rachel Weisz keeps her English accent as Evanora, but she's supposed to be Theodora's sister, who is not English. Didn't make sense to me. 2) As in the Wizard of Oz, some characters in Oz resemble people who Oscar (James Franco) knows in his real life, but unlike in the original film, there is no real explanation for this or anything to tie back to his life in Kansas. 3) The film is set in 1905, but I found some of the dialogue and wardrobe were too modern for that time. As for the performances, I feel, like many others, that James Franco and Mila Kunis were not well suited for their roles. Franco seems too laid-back to be the Wizard, and Kunis comes across as more of a heartbroken teenager than a wicked witch. On the bright side, the film does have some great performances, and should entertain Oz fans with references to the original movie (including hints at the cowardly lion and scarecrow). I enjoyed how, like the old movie, it transitions from sepia in the Kansas scenes to brilliant colour in Oz. Despite its flaws, it is an entertaining and enjoyable movie.",Oz the Great and Powerful
398,williameigenmann,OZ: The not so Great and Powerful,6,16 March 2013,"Oz the Great and Powerful was very disappointing to say the least, and it suffers some major flaws, one of which is the terrible acting. Every performance in this movie, with the exception of the china girl, is bad, boring and expressionless. The main character OZ didn't once look remotely interested in the world he was visiting. There was no wonder, no amazement, no sense of ah. The role of Oz was most likely missed cast. It's sad when a little china girl (most likely her performance was motion captured) has the best performance in a movie.The movie relied heavily on the use of visual effects, and it's quite obvious. Most of the time, a heavy use of CG pulls me out of a movie, but in this case, the visual effects helped the film. Even though I could tell just about every frame had a visual effect, the visuals helped the movie stylistically, which works in the movie's favor.This movie is intended for family and kids. The kids in the theater (when I watched the movie) seemed to enjoy the film, laughing at the jokes during the film's lighthearted moments.

I rated it an 8 because of the brilliant plot line, gorgeous animation and brilliant cast.

400,bstrembicke,"Oz fails to be great, and lacks much power.",3,13 March 2013,"I went in with pretty low expectations, and still find myself disappointed. Why? Because the film, while stunning, and more than a little daring, lacks an earthly magic unknown to Director Sam Raimi; a magic called ""substance"".The film follows ""Oz"", a man who lands in the land of ""Oz"", and influences the lives of three witches, while along the way meeting a cast of unique characters.The film has a lot of problems. It's yellow brick road is full of intense plot holes, ranging from character ages, to geographical locations, which is hard to put up with, especially when referencing something so iconic as ""The Wizard of Oz"".One of the principle problem is the cast, which delivers where you least expect it (Zach Braff, and particularly Joey King's heart wrenching moments), and fails to do so where one does expect it (Michelle Williams and Mila Kunis's unrealized moral commentaries). To be blunt though, the story fails to deliver on it's potential. It becomes a bloated, overdone yet underdone, kids story, when it should've been a moving, heart wrenching, emotional commentary on the nature of humanity for teens, or even adults. It lacks any moral, intellectual, or (for the MOST part, but this isn't always true) emotional, substance. And most of this is the fault of the writers; although I would be so bold as to rest a little blame on director Sam Raimi, particularly for his casting decisions.Williams as Glinda should have worked, but a ""Jessica Alba - Fantastic Four"" spray tan, a very muted gown and tiara, and a Kristen Chenoweth wig make her nearly unrecognizable as Glinda the Good Witch of the North/South. And what's more, is she fails to cash in on the frailty of Glinda's character, who is pressured to always be good, and right. This may be the worst performance of her absolutely incredible career.The same goes for Kunis as Theodora, Raimi's version of The Wicked Witch of the West. The casting decision just seems to come out of nowhere. And so does her performance. There's no depth or consequence to her naïveté, and no justification to her villainy; she just becomes a beacon of evil through a spell by her sister, which, granted, makes her more akin to Margaret Hamilton's Witch than ""Wicked's"" Elphaba character, but this also alienates her sympathy factor. She's a broken-hearted woman. The film's Eponine. People should be rooting for her, not enjoying Oz toying with her at the end. Those are the two stand outs for disappointing, but Franco continues to be abysmal, and Weisz seems to have wandered into the wrong movie.As for the positives, ""Oz"" is a fun film, full of great references, not just to ""The Wizard of Oz"", but also to the Disney film ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"", and even an occasional obscure reference to ""Wicked"". The effects are top notch, costumes are pretty (if uncharacteristic and nonsensical), and the supporting characters are sublime. The China-Girl (who should have been given a bloody name) is a beautiful subplot that nearly moved me to tears.It's worth a watch, but mostly as a guidebook for how NOT to do any eventual ""Wicked"" film, or as sparkly, occasionally good, entertainment.",Oz the Great and Powerful
401,MrSosotris,"Not a Great Movie, but Still a Good Movie",9,9 March 2013,"I went into this film prepared to be disappointed. Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland felt a bit lifeless to me (except for Johnny Depp's Hatter) and I couldn't help but compare this movie to that one in my head. So, I went and saw this one with reservations.I'm a huge Oz fan. I love the original books. I love the movie. I love Wicked (book and musical), Tin Man, Return to Oz, The Wiz (the musical more than the movie), and even Geoff Ryman's oh-so-depressing novel Was. There's no such thing as an ""official"" version of the story anymore, so I don't mind a little pastiche here and there. After all, Baum's Witch was short, wore an eye patch and a very tall hat, and brandished an umbrella, but Margaret Hamilton effectively erased that version in favor of the glorious green-skinned villain we all know and love. So talk of ""the real version of the story"" is pretty much moot at this point.This movie didn't disappoint me at all. Yes, it had some issues, but I didn't really mind overall. I left the theater with a big goofy grin and I'll probably go see it again. It was an enjoyable romp through a gorgeous landscape with enough insider references to merit multiple viewings. It rarely takes itself too seriously, and never tries to step on the toes of any other version of the story. There are references to events in the books which, before now, have never made it into any other adaptations (such as the China Girl), as well as many familiar visual cues from the 1939 film (the guard's outfits, the spiral where one fork of the Yellow Brick Road begins, and even a shot of the Kansas horizon with a scraggly grasping tree seem comfortably familiar). There was even a visual cue that, while it may not have been taken from this source, certainly suggested a character from Tin Man. I felt that Mila Kunis came across as a bit flat. Her character arc seems too forced and we don't really get to see much progression. I didn't mind James Franco, to be completely honest. He was appropriately sleazy when he needed to be and charming in a goofy way when needed. I think he could have invested his character with a bit more depth, but it never really turned me off his character at all. Superficiality is a huge part of his character, and I thought it worked, overall. The side characters were a delight, with some of the best comedic lines coming from Oz's traveling companions. And, of course, Rachel Weisz steals the show with a delicious performance, embodying a great number of classic villains from Snow White's Evil Queen to Star Wars' Emperor Palpatine.Visually, the film is a delight. Sam Raimi turns Oz into its own wonderland without it ever seeming predictable or tired. One criticism I had with Burton's Alice was that it didn't really give the audience a chance to luxuriate in the bizarre landscapes of Underland all that much. It had great character design, but the landscape seemed a bit low- key. Raimi, on the other hand, gives audiences exactly what they're looking for. Gems, flowers, waterfalls, mountains, rock formations, sunsets, etc. that are completely breathtaking. Not only that, but the CGI is crisp and clean.Danny Elfman's score was...OK. One thing I've noticed with him lately is that almost everything he does now sounds less and less unique. We've got the requisite haunting waltz and the spectacular pounding swirling opening credits theme, but other than that, I found almost everything to be a bit forgettable, which is sad because Elfman is one of my favorite film composers. The music isn't bad, but it just doesn't add as much as it could have. But overall, I really enjoyed this movie. It's a delightful romp through a colorful wilderness that asks nothing more from its audience than a chance to have fun. This isn't a thoughtful, complex Oscar-winner nor is it a gritty realistic fantasy a la Lord of the Rings or Game of Thrones. It's a kaleidoscopic portrait that seems at once familiar and new. Children will love it (though very young children may be scared by a few of the antagonistic creatures) adults will enjoy picking out all the loving homages to the books and the 1939 film. It's a fun way to spend an evening, and you won't be disappointed, just don't go in expecting deep, complex high fantasy. If you liked Burton's Alice, you will definitely enjoy this film (and you'll probably enjoy it more, if I may so myself).",Oz the Great and Powerful
402,ale-knaui,I expected it to be bad and I was right,3,10 March 2013,"DON'T WATCH!! Go get yourself some 1939 Wizard of Oz's goodness instead and spare yourself of this under achievement of film making, storytelling and acting!One would think that at least the CGI would be mind-blowing, but it was just ""meh"", for what is now possible to achieve. Also, they could have at least used make-up for the wicked witch, instead of half-hearted and bright-colored effects everywhere.Terrible acting. James Franco always acts sleepy, not only in Oz. Mila Kunis's character was miscast, and over acted IMO. Everyone else was pretty alright, but that's not enough to save the movie from this two bad leads.Poor characters. Stereotypical and superficial Wizard of Oz, dumb Theodora, non-developed Evanora and weak Glinda. This witches are supposed to be powerful women and should not be just waiting around for a man to finish their problems.The story was bad, predictable and underwhelming for the most part, but the ending made some sense. And please, screen writers, STOP MAKING UP COUPLES! What is this? Fanfic?There is a really poor depiction of women here. Terrible role-modeling and characterization in general.I think someone should make a REAL Oz adaptation, truthful to L. F. Baum's books, so that people would realize how wrong they are when they think they know about Oz, and to teach movie makers that they can't just make up stuff and feed it to watchers as ""Oz""... that must stop now!",Oz the Great and Powerful

Tha casting was very good the story line fit very well with the original Wizard of Oz (1939). With the change of the Wicked Witch, that is if you have never seen the original movie. You should know that the evil witches are the East and West. This movie has a very good story and a very good cast. If you loved the Wizard of Oz and you always wanted to know how Oz got to be how it is this movie is perfect for you. I recommend it to any Oz fans or anyone who is interested in seeing the original Wizard of Oz, this movie will help you better understand the origins of Oz and the all power full wizard.

Other than CGI effects it has nothing to do with anything other than the original 1939 movie The Wizard of Oz.I grew up in the 60s. I saw The Wizard of Oz when I was very young and at the time the visual effects were the norm before CGI. That movie made such a tremendous impact on me and everyone else of my generation. I didn't know that it was a classic then because I was seeing it for the first time.Oz the Great and Powerful is the perfect prequel! Fans of the original will see so many things they recognize! So many questions are answered. I loved the idea of the movie and encourage anyone who loved the original to see it, preferably in 3D.I do have to agree with some of the other opinions in other reviews. James Franco is seriously mis-cast, for one. The story did drag in places and I actually nodded off for a minute toward the beginning. But even still, I thought it was a great movie. I loved the way that the sets, characters, and effects were absolutely true to the look and feel of the original, but modernized at the same time. There was one key element from the original that was not even mentioned in this movie, but I'll let you watch it to figure out what it is.",Oz the Great and Powerful

The songs, the casting, the seamless yet unworldly story arc magically combine psychoanalytic and sociological themes, not to mentioned thinly- veiled drug references coming together so perfectly that it would appear that the chance to attempt this quasi prequel in this day and age was too great a challenge to turn down for this director. Unfortunately due to several flaws it falls flat like a house on a witch. Firstly, Franco- just awful, I'm sorry, he may be a smart kid and a good actor but he isn't able to pull off the con-man who finds he has a heart called for here. Trivia claims Depp and Downey turned the role down. The former, maybe, the later quite possibly could have made a significant difference here. Secondly, Kunis. I'm sorry but I COD't get the image of Meg as the giant moon-worm out of my head as she screamed on so, ugh! and finally, I am left with an inability to connect this particular premise with the classic, which began and ended in a reality with a coma-induced delerium used to bring together all the dots.

I know this movie doesn't really tell the exact story of the tale but the cast and trailer just made me watch this movie.All I can say it was a pleasant surprise. Michelle Williams was absolutely stunning and had a great chemistry on screen. This is just one of those movies that are just perfect entertainment with a good glass of wine and which you can enjoy with the whole family.The colors and fantasy world were beautifully put on screen and really make the viewer feel like he is watching a fairytale without ever being too childish. Pleasant surprise sums it up perfectly!,Oz the Great and Powerful
407,morieartym,A Great and Powerful Let-Down,6,8 April 2013,"When I first witnessed the trailer for ""Oz the Great and Powerful,"" I'll admit I was pretty psyched. I am a huge fan of the original MGM film as a contribution to cinema, and also of the classic book series by L. Frank Baum, and this film seemed to be a loving and beautiful send-up to both. What's more, the film was being directed by the frenetically masterful Sam Raimi and starred James Franco, who I have had much respect for since his performance in ""127 Hours."" How could this go wrong? Oh, let me count the ways. Don't get me wrong, the film is not terrible, simply disappointing. Anyway, I saw the film at my local drive-in, meaning that I could not properly appreciate the visuals and 3D that were clearly the real stars of the show. These visuals were quite attractive, if a bit CGI-reliant. However, the overall sleek presentation of the film is glaringly weighed down by a weak script, thin plot, and in particular bad performances. The lead performances of the film were laughably bad, even considering the weak and unconvincing material they were given to work with. James Franco seems horribly miscast as the man-behind-the-curtain himself, lacking the charm and bravado that the character is clearly supposed to exude. His uncomfortable and inconsistent performance leaves one with the impression that he did not even look at the script before arriving for the first day of shooting. Opposite Franco stars Mila Kunis as Theodora, aka (spoiler-alert, supposedly) the Wicked Witch of the West. In the early parts of the film, Kunis acts as ""the Wizard's"" naive and airy love-interest. However, she abruptly transforms into a certain cackling green monster after he breaks her heart. Upon her transformation, Kunis trades in a bland and wooden performance for one that is painfully over-the-top and phony, clearly attempting to be a poor-man's Margaret Hamilton. Likewise, Michelle Williams is endlessly dull as the personality-escapingly good witch Glinda. As is universally agreed, the film's only entertaining performance is Rachel Weisz as the wonderfully, subtly evil Evanora, aka the Wicked Witch of the East. One actress cannot singlehandedly carry a film, however. The plot is just as thin and vapid as the acting and script. The story is clichéd and predictable, as are the twists, if you can even call them that. Are we really supposed to be surprised that a slutty Rachel Weisz dressed all in black is a bad guy? What's more, the tone is woefully inconsistent (is this movie for kids or not?), and the villains are blind idiots who are surprised when their minions are defeated by a field of poppies planted RIGHT OUTSIDE THEIR OWN CASTLE. Also, aside from the aforementioned Wizard and witches, the characters of the film are underdeveloped and two-dimensional. Why should we care about the generic little China Girl who doesn't even get a name (I did, but I'm a sap that way)? All in all, despite impressive visuals and a few (read, one) strong performances, the film is dragged down by some horrible miscasting and a lazy and unintuitive script. A huge disappointment for anyone who is a fan of Oz or of director Sam Raimi.",Oz the Great and Powerful
408,bradleykirksey,"Good, with glaring holes.",6,22 March 2013,"I was very excited for this before it came out. I actually went to the midnight release.It was a solid film for the most part. The script wasn't bad, there was a good story, CGI gets better every year, and there were some good laughs. It was a good family film that you could take kids to without a problem.Here's the catch(es). First, the actors. Franco isn't bad, really, but he was pretty obviously not the first choice. The morally ambiguous main character you're supposed to respect more than love is Johnny Depp's and Robert Downy Jr's shticks. Without looking it up, I guessed that they were both offered the job for Franco. The witches were also clearly not first choice, especially in Eveanora's case. These were solid, B-list actors showed into a $215,000,000 movie that was supposed to be bigger than life. And frankly, Rachel Weisz isn't bigger than life.I've seen a lot of people pan Kunis's performance, but I don't really blame her. She was given a lot of really rough dialog. She wasn't given a lot to work with.As everyone has said, the CGI was sort of abused. It was made into the main theme, rather than a helper. The creators tried it to be Avatar, but it wasn't.That's how this film feels to me. It feels like a movie destined for the $5 bin at Wal-Mart, good for two hours, that just tried so hard to be bigger than life, but without the cast or the dialog, or the firepower to do it.",Oz the Great and Powerful
409,info-565-374664,Oz the Great and Powerful is why we go to the movies and why films are made.,10,6 March 2013,"Oz the Great and Powerful is why we go to the movies and why films are made. With this imaginative spiritual prequel to L. Frank Baum's 1900 novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz and the 1939 MGM film The Wizard of Oz, prolific and profound filmmaker Sam Raimi has not only created one of the greatest films of all time, but humbly celebrates the true genius of the greatest wizard of all time: Thomas Alva Edison, The Wizard of Menlo Park. Credited as the fourth most prolific inventor in history, Edison has developed many devices that greatly influenced life around the world, including the phonograph, the motion picture camera, and a long-lasting, practical electric light bulb. Edison's famous saying: ""Genius is one percent inspiration, ninety-nine percent perspiration,"" manifests itself gloriously in Raimi's masterwork. Just as Edidon spinned his wizardry, Raimi conjures up his own enchantment to deliver a sumptuous feast that tells a great story in an entertaining and spectacular way, truly unlike anything you could have ever imagined, and one that would have ignited the inspiration of Edison and Baum and like-minded visionaries. Ironically, just as Edison became a telegraph operator after he saved a three-year-old boy from being struck by a runaway train, so is our ordinary small-time circus magician with dubious ethics in Oz The Great and Powerful hurled away from dusty Kansas to the vibrant Land of Oz where he becomes empowered after saving lives. Oz the Great and Powerful is ultimately about on ordinary, flawed con-artist who shows those who believes in him that he might not be the Wizard they expected, but is indeed the Wizard they need. From the opening scene where Raimi skillfully presents the film in black-and-white and transitions into color when the protagonist arrives in Oz, akin to the 1939 film, (also changing aspect ratio from 4:3 Academy ratio to 16:9 widescreen), the spellbinding adventure snowballs into an unforgettable climax that you will never forget. What makes Oz The Great and Powerful the masterwork it is, is that Raimi and his exceptional creative team opted to film the majority of the film for real, mounting the entire production on seven sound stages at the 675,000 square foot sound stage facility in Pontiac, Michigan. And, like any great genius, Raimi is a sincere and honest storymaker who teamed up with the greatest wizards in the film industry to help bring the enchanting Land of Oz to life, Raimi assembled his own band of technical wizards and movie magicians, bring Mitchell Kapner and David Lindsay-Abaire's imaginative screenplay to life. The combination of the artistry of the creative team is out of this world, bringing to life a vibrant world that explodes with unbelievable designs, powerfully underscored by Danny Elfman's soaring score. There is so much detail in the loaded design that you will definitely have to see it again to be able to take it all in: when Oscar and Theodora walk down the yellow brick road flanked by fields of sunflowers, it is amazing how each one of the sunflowers turns to greet them. Raimi's casting is equally exceptional: James Franco shines as the predestined Wizard; Mila Kunis (Black Swan) is superb as the tormented young witch Theodora; Rachel Weisz (The Constant Gardener) delivers another great performance as Theodora's older sister, Evanora, the witch who rules over the Emerald City; and Michelle Williams (Brokeback Mountain, Blue Valentine, My Week with Marilyn) is sensational as Glinda, the Good Witch. The film would not be the same with Zach Braff (Scrubs, Garden State) who plays Franco's circus assistant, and also lends his vocal talents to one of the exquisite CGI creatures in the story—Finley, the winged monkey who accompanies the magician on his journey through Oz, serving as his sounding board and the magician's conscience. Then there's 13-year-old actress Joey King (Ramona and Beezus), who plays a girl in a wheelchair at the circus and voices another unforgettable CGI character in the story, China Girl, the porcelain child who also joins the future Wizard on his fateful excursion through Oz. Oz the Great and Powerful has everything in entertainment you can wish for and much, much more. When you leave the cinema you have to adjust your eyesight as the vibrant colours that embrace the visual onslaught bleed away. Oz The Great and Powerful affirms the power of storytelling and the artistry of filmmakers whose passion results in gripping and tense escapism that is filled with awe and emotion, not forgetting a delicious sense of humour. You will undoubtedly be swept away to the land of Oz and at the end of the journey not only see the world differently, but have a different understanding of why the story has captured the imagination of the world for more than a century. It is not only a story about magic, witches and strange creatures, but a human story. Oz The Great and Powerful shows that ordinary people can achieve greatness and that you don't need to have real magical powers to become a great leader or become the king of your own universe. All you need is to believe in yourself and do things for the right reason and like our unlikely hero in Oz, you will find something that money and power cannot give you, true love and absolute friendship. Healing begins with small, unseen miracles. When Oz hands gives his flying a monkey a gift at the end of Oz the Great and Powerful, an audible emotional reaction rippled through the audience. If a film can make you believe in porcelain dolls and flying monkeys then the true power of film will always triumph, striving to give audiences meaningful and rewarding escapism that fosters hope and understanding and make the world a better and more colourful place. Oz The Great and Powerful is a film that will delight all ages for many years to come. It is a wonderful ride that soars on the wings of imagination.",Oz the Great and Powerful
410,vampirevanessa17,Awesome!!,10,13 March 2013,No it is not anything like the original Wizard of OZ. it was the best movie I've seen in years. James Franco was really good. I went to see it in IMAX 3D it was worth it. Im definitely gonna buy it on DVD the effects weren't the best but for a family movie it was good. It made me laugh and it made me connect with all the characters. It also answered some questions we all had when we watched the a wizard of oz. I always like to know the back story of the characters and tho did it perfectly. I would recommend that movie to anyone. Mila was just perfect I loved her. I live all her acting. I've seen every movie of hers and if that's not enough the guy from scrubs comes out in the movie! What more can you ask for?! Go see this movie! Take your kids and your grandmother it's the perfect family movie. You won't regret it and paying a little extra for IMAX 3D is worth it. 100/100!!!,Oz the Great and Powerful
411,mamadrag,what a disappointment!,4,9 March 2013,"i was so excited when i heard they were making this. wasn't happy about James Franco, not a fan, and i was right again. he can not act, but in his defense no one else in this movie pulled their best acting out either. they seemed like they had never acted in front of a green screen and no one bothered to tell them how.there are some beautiful scenes but that hardly makes up for everything else that fell short. someone needs to remind Disney and the writers that the great and powerful oz got to the emerald city via Dorothy's dream. they really screwed it up, for me anyway.i won't be recommending this to anyone. if you must see it in theaters, don't waste your money on 3-D, it won't make up for the horrible acting and story line.",Oz the Great and Powerful
412,InsomniaQueen,Didn't love it. Didn't hate it.,5,2 April 2013,"I just watched this movie today. Let's just say, the trailer made it look a lot better than it is. First of all, the effects were mostly good. But some of them were kind of choppy. Such as, when the good witch and the wicked witch are fighting towards the end. Or when Oz is flying through the tornado and stuff is coming at him. But the overall scenery and lighting of the movie was beautiful. The plot line was slightly boring and predictable. But it wasn't terrible. There just wasn't really anything memorable about the plot. The acting wasn't bad ether. Personally I think the worst part of the movie was that it tried too hard to be funny. All the jokes were really lame. But the people at the theater seamed to find it pretty funny. I didn't really dislike the movie. I just didn't like it.That's my review.",Oz the Great and Powerful

414,msisis62,"True to the original movie, The Wizard of Oz.",7,22 March 2013,"The movie did a great job of reminding those of us who watched The Wizard of Oz, as to what was done before, vs now in movie making. I enjoyed this movie because I was a fan of the original. My husband, however, who never liked the Wizard of Oz, found this one so boring he fell asleep. He did later, however say that the special effects were good. He did complain that Glinda needed a wand, and the evil witches did not, but alas, that was from the original movie, and so, the creator of this stayed true.The only thing holding this back from being a 10 was Franco. He's not that great of an actor. In fact, he's pretty dry. At times I actually saw true acting in his skills, and other times he was just over the top. The rest all seemed to be good though. I loved the casting for Rachel Wiesz. What an excellent job that was! I would not have expected her for that role, and was totally surprised. Overall, it's a true to form Wizard of Oz, The Great and powerful wizard of our childhood memories.

415,munterbach33,Not quite,6,9 March 2013,"If I were to give this movie a one word review, I would need to go with  OK. This spin-off of the beloved fairy tail, The Wizard of Oz, was  pitched as a prequel to give ""The Wizard"" a back-story. There were good  intentions behind this film so it had potential, but I could not tell  who the target demographic was. The overall plot was very dark and a  majority of the humor was very adult but with a PG rating, they were  obviously trying to appeal to the same young audience that the original  did but I think they missed their mark. The only thing that saved this  movie was James Franco's portrayal of the wizard and the likable  creatures spread throughout the story. Mila Kunis, although given the  second highest billing, had very limited screen time compared to the  other characters. Lastly, Oz (James Franco), was the only dynamic  character in the whole plot which gave it a very one dimensional feel  and struggled to keep my interest. I have a very ""take it or leave it""  attitude toward this film and say that it is very far from a ""must  see"".  6.5 out of 10",Oz the Great and Powerful
416,teacupspider,What I thought was wrong with this movie.,4,8 March 2013,"So this is my first review so please hold through with me.The movie started, the opening credits started playing and I was in awe, they were beautifully done and my favorite part of the movie. I can't help but think if they put as much time into the movie as they did these credits the movie would have been a hit.First I shall start with the biggest flaw, the morals. When Oz enters The world of Oz he's a guy who cheats his way into women's panties and breaks there hearts who LITERALLY just promised God he would become a better man. Now I was happy it was a little realistic in him not reforming on the dot, but you would think by the end of the movie he would have at least tried to reform or something. He goes on to lie and seduce Theodora and after seems to literally just jump to her sister. Of course the second he meets Glinda he's smitten by her and just tosses the other two and everything they have said away. OK? That's not really where I have the problem, it's the fact this NEVER comes back to bite him at all. Glinda knowing what he's done at the end of the movie just falls for him as well! I thought this was preposterous that he literally never suffered from his actions.What I think SHOULD HAVE happened was he should have been smitten with Glinda and Glinda knowing what he had done to the others at the end of the movie should have thanked him kindly, gave him the kingdom but said ""No, I'm not just going to throw myself at you. I'm not a trophy, I have dignity."" (of course not in those words). Leaving Oz heartbroken in return for breaking all those girls hearts but still with a happy ending because he now had friends and the kingdom and all.Another thing that bugged me was the casting for all three of the witches. I was very disappointed in Glinda, the girl whom played he didn't suite her at all. I was also disappointed in Mila Kunis. I've seen her act before, but she could barely act in this movie. It was awful. Though I do think it may have just been poor casting and bad scripts. Rachel Weisz was fine but again I think could have done better in literally any other part.Also I thought I should mention the very merry land of Oz looked NOTHING like the Oz I remember growing up. It literally looked like left over backgrounds from Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland. Costumes some were amazing and others were lacking. Theodora as the wicked witch was silly not frightening. They didn't seem to put any effort into her make up, just slabbed some green on and said ""Well that's good enough"". Also the outfit Theodora wore when she first met Oz literally was from a completely different time frame from every other character in the whole movie. Tight leather pants? Ya that's appropriate for a beloved children's movie's prequel. Now a little about things I did enjoy. I liked seeing the cowardly lion, I thought it was so cute and spent the rest of the movie trying to find Tinman and Scarecrow. I loved the water fairy designs. That's the sort of creativity I was looking for in this movie, that and the Emeralds that bloomed into Ruby flowers. Little touches that were just perfect. And lastly I adored the ceramic ball jointed doll girl because I myself am a doll collector. So I spent the movie swooning over how adorable her character was. I liked the fact she linked to the girl he saw in Kansas and I liked the fact she brought a little emotion to the film.If it weren't for the moral whole I really wouldn't have a problem with this movie, I would have brushed it aside an another kid movie I didn't care for, but there was just so much unseen sexuality and not repercussions for Oz's actions. I feel like that's the wrong thing to teach children.So thank you for reading my review, I hope this helps.",Oz the Great and Powerful
417,jaltrogge83,Just not great,5,31 May 2013,"I was very hopeful , and also a little nervous, when I heard they were going to make a new ""OZ"" movie. I went into this movie with high standards and expectations, and after about 5 minutes, I knew my standards would not be met. The story is poorly written with many plot holes, the acting is not good and often feels overdone, and the script is just plain boring. One good thing I can say about this movie is the score, so great job Danny Elfman. Another good thing about this movie Is its art style and creativity, but that can not cover up all of the bad things about this movie.So, if you want a cute and not too serious movie to watch with the kids then this is for you, but if you want a great movie with a wonderful story and great acting.

418,ironwilliamson,Beautiful Film,8,10 March 2013,"The Great and Powerful Oz ... was just a man. We always knew that, but did we know what kind of man he really was? The 1939 film, as good as it was, never investigated the man behind the curtain. But this one does, and does so in a way that casts a brighter light on some of the other major characters in The Wizard of Oz.First, the not-so-wonderful parts of the film:The black-and-white section was a tad too long, and some of the interaction between the characters (particularly the first few minutes) could have been cut. The critical elements were the music box, the live-performance reveal, and the escape scenes, and those were well-done. Some of the other parts of this portion of the movie could have been shortened somewhat.Second, Franco overdoes it slightly in the first half of the film; he is too much the womanizer and there is too little to empathize about him until late in the movie.Third, the transformation of Theodora could have been explored a little deeper. What possessed her to leap from innocence to evil in one easy step? And I'm not referring to the poison apple.But overall, the film was immensely enjoyable, for the following reasons:First, it strikes the right balance between the modern need for thrills and a more classic appreciation of serene beauty. The scenes where Oz looks in awe at the crystalline flora, for example, emphasized the wonder in this wonderful land of Oz.Second, it contains a tried-and-true dose of morality, which is: Be true to yourself, and you will accomplish things both good and great. The storyline well-meshes a sense of the power of technology combined with ingenuity and good will. Most youngster won't realize, until they're much older, that they've been taught a valuable life lesson in seeing the transformation of Oscar Diggs into the Oz he was meant to be.Third, this movie tells us that the traditional ways of Hollywood, where story was king, aren't as foreign to us as some would have us believe. This is true in two senses: The Baum stories are shown to have a power greater than the glitziest CGI; and also, Disney has shown us that it is possible, once again, to showcase a plot that is meaningful yet fun, lovely yet thrilling, and sweet without being saccharine.I enjoyed this movie in 3D, and I think that, overall, it's suitable for children from six to a hundred and six.",Oz the Great and Powerful

James, was a lieing cheating, thief and he got away with it? hmmm. I also did not like the beg, when the screen was black & white and tiny, like full screen with black bars, it just started out weak, and for me, did not get better. I did not believe James Franco or mila's character. I did not really like the China Doll ( Very Winny character, and sweet, but not good acting and the monkey side kick, was OK, but most of his jokes did not follow through. The Scencs were beautiful.....and my favorite Character was Glenda the Good witch. Michelle Williams was the best actress in the movie. But, In some parts of the movie, the script just was not believable....The movie got really boring and dull. Milla's character actually was pretty good once she turned into the Green witch. She was made for that part. She is a dark, evil kind of girl. So, overall I liked this movie, but to me its just like the boring spin off of RETURN TO OZ. I saw this movie in 3D ( Without 3D I would of fell asleep forsure..., and it was just OK for me. I would recommend save your couple dollars for REDBOX, then your not stuck watching all the boring parts. Thanks.",Oz the Great and Powerful
423,jennanne312,"Toto...I don't think we're in The Land of Oz, anymore.",3,24 March 2013,"Question: What does Frank Baum, The Wizard of Oz, James Franco, Disney, and a talking monkey have in common?Answer: Apparently, not much.""OZ. the Great and Powerful"" is Disney's treatment of Frank Baum's ""Not The Wizard of Oz."" The IMDb plot description keeps it simple: ""A small-time magician arrives in an enchanted land and is forced to decide if he will be a good man or a great one."" Good enough. We already know the dealio about Oz, right?Soum..hmmmmm..wellLet's just start with something simple: don't go see this unless you see it in 3-D. Long windows of time crawl by as giant, brightly colored flowers open up slowly to introduce to us this crayyyyzy new land of Oz. Without the 3D enhancement, it feels like all of a sudden, and without warning, Disney has pacing issues.(From my perspective, Disney did ""suddenly"" have an unusual struggle. The Mouse in my opinion, is ""The King of the World-building!."" I fell in love with Walt Disney, hard core, at the age of ten for this this magical ability to sell us new, fully functional worlds. He is one of the reasons I write. But, as this slightly predictable landscape of Oz unfolded, all I could think was that the Judy Garland/MGM/non-CGI Wizard of Oz was more creative than what I was seeing on this colossal movie screen. For any other studio, I would give them a pass. But I won't give Disney a pass on failing to transform the space in front of my eyes into something altogether new, and believable, and visually delicious)Now, about the script. I left the theater befuddled, trying to pinpoint exactly ""what ""and how much of that ""what"" failed in this film. I was left with more questions than answers:  Who was the intended audience? No self-respecting adult can buy into that talking monkey, no matter how PETA-sympathetic they try to make his face. There was also no character created just for the kids. The China Doll was young, but was a side kick to a side kick, and will never ever sit at the Happy Meal table in the cafeteria of cute movie characters. Teens might go. Might. It's rated PG, so they can go by themselves to the Cineplex at the mall on Friday nights. (That's what kids still do on Friday nights, right?) What tone were we reaching for, here? Was it whimsy? A fairy tale? A morality tale? I couldn't tell. The script reached into too many pockets. I'm sure the ""tongue in cheek-iness,"" the bad jokes, and the 4th wall asides were all probably placed in the script to hide the seams between ""kid movie"" and ""adult movie,"" But, instead, they strike you between the eyes like an unwelcome branch you didn't see coming on a trail. It whacks us, and we have to take a minute to wipe our eyes and find our bearings again and again.  Were they intentionally trying to keep Oz's character a little sympathetic? (I suspect Franco's extremely limited range might have been part of the problem, but I'm doing my best to stay in the screenplay end of this shallow pool) I was a little surprised to hear his character fear that he might not pass the ""good heart"" test of flying through a bubble (A bubble that looked just like the Dawn dish soap variety I buy for my son at the dollar store) Up to that point I just saw him as a cheapskate prankster with a line for every lady. He wasn't necessarily bad, and he seemed minutes from redemption from the very start. I never felt Oz was in real trouble. Stakes, stakes, stakes. Final thoughts:  James Franco can't act.  The over-employed Mila Kunis didn't have the depth and weight in her soul to carry a believable transformation from an innocent sister to a raging nemesis worthy of the legendary Oz.  My biggest wish was that they had picked a direction on the movie making compass, be it Magic, Tongue in Cheek, Scary, Morality Taleand then nailed it to the wall..  The ingredients of this movie don't add up to the cake it was baked to be. I think there was ultimately too much vanilla in this mix.",Oz the Great and Powerful

This is no Oscar award winning script, but a fun, visually STUNNING fantasy joy ride. Enjoy this movie for what it is, stop being so overly critical and let go of reality for a few hours! If you approach this movie with that attitude, you WILL enjoy it. It can be slow in parts, but not to the point of boredom.

Make it cool, you only get one shot like this.Final, James Franco, well done in your role. The film is actually more enjoyable the second time around when your excitement to see something new is replaced by a greater focus on the flow of the film and how it is written. Thankfully it was better than Willy Wonka...I was a little worried it would be too wacky and would fail to capture the magic of the first.8/10",Oz the Great and Powerful
426,smn-678-48817,"Not Bad, But Not Great Either",5,6 May 2013,"I just want to start off this review by saying it is not a bad movie by any means, but it is definitely overrated and some of the performances were just bad. Mila Kunis may have shown some of her worst acting to date here as she really tries (and trust me you will see what I'm saying when you see it). It's almost laughable at times and really takes away from the drama building at certain points. As for James Franco this is not his best work but he is passable. He is strangely rather stoic later on in the film in times where he should exude more character. The best performance by far was Rachel Weisz who was absolutely brilliant in her role. Zach Braff as well was great and he was a talking monkey. The plot doesn't seem to be going any where for a large portion of the movie and at times you will forget what you are watching. On that note the CGI is great and some of the effects will definitely catch your eye. All and all it is a pretty average flick with only minor redeeming qualities.",Oz the Great and Powerful

The acting is pretty good but the so called hero I don't know if I want to hate him or love him.BUT here is the most important thing I will tell you. You will learn NOTHING and I mean NOTHING from this movie. A child story of any kind either has a lovely gooey feeling to it or a lesson to be learned. However no some of the gooey feeling is there but not in a way that I would describe enough. The lesson and moral of the story however... don't exist. Walking out of a theater thinking ... did I love this movie or did I hate it... then it hits you.. he didn't learn s**t not a bloody thing.It will end by you sometimes thinking ""WOW IT WAS AWESOME"" and sometimes ""Was that worth my time?"" so I recommend watch it.. but just expect nothing and you might gain something.so 5 out of 10... cause you just don't know... you don't",Oz the Great and Powerful

Within the first 30 minutes of the film I could tell that James Franco was a bad choice for Oz. It was so easy to tell that he just couldn't get into the part and couldn't pretend that animated characters were actually in front of him. He was not invested in his character and could not make it believable. If he can't act like this whole adventure is real, then how are we supposed to enjoy the film? I became very bored, very quickly and very irritated that I had wasted my time and money on a movie that had fallen flat. I did enjoy Tony Cox as James's side kick and Rachel Weisz as the witch Evanor and the animated China Doll. Michelle Williams and Mila Kunis were not very good in their parts and I feel they were miscast as well. This film could have been very good with the right cast. I can tell when my daughter gets bored or distracted in a movie that does not hold her attention as she climbs onto my lap and she did this in this movie.

The one thing that killed it for me was Mila Kunis' performance. I don't think she's a bad actress but God she sucked balls in this movie. This is just my personal opinion. But seeing her as the wicked witch was not right. Well, SEEING her was dope. The make up looked very nice. But HEARING Meg as the wicked witch was just weak. I'm sure there were better actresses that could have been chosen. Other than that, it is a decent movie. I wish Mila Kunis would have been the other witch. And vise versa. Zach Braff was awesome. James Franco was decent. This movie had potential to be a classic. Instead, it's just another ""remix"" of an old movie.",Oz the Great and Powerful
431,controlledchaos05,"Not So Great, Not So Powerful",6,9 March 2013,"When you take a movie that is based on such a quintessential classic film such as ""The Wizard of Oz,"" one might be mindful to stay somewhat truthful to the tale. This was not the case for ""Oz The Great and Powerful."" I mean, seriously, not many people can say that they are unfamiliar with the stories or the original movie. There was so much creative license taken that the movie ended up being some bastardized version on the original that made absolutely no sense, was horribly written, even more so horribly acted, and just plain unenjoyable to watch. While Rachel Weisz and Michelle Williams were believable as Evanora and Glinda, they completely overacted their roles, ate the scenery, and upstaged everyone and everything on screen, even each other. Additionally, I am a huge fan of Mila Kunis, but even I have to admit that she was horrendous in the role of Theodora. She could give two shits less about the role and it becomes apparent almost immediately that even SHE realized that she was taking part in ruining a classic movie and an even more classic role. And I won't even get into how much James Franco ruined this whole story and experience for me. While the movie was visually spectacular, they spent way too much time focusing on the scenery, CGI at its most overplayed. Where it was easy to see that everything was beautiful and brilliant in coloration, they used it as a means to distract the viewer from the fact that their script and screenplay was completely sub-par. When the last 20 minutes becomes the highlight of the film, there is something majorly wrong and Sam Raimi, whom I usually love, knew this, but hoped that we wouldn't. I am not saying that one should not see the movie completely. I am just saying that spending $14 at IMAX is definitely not the way to go. Paying $10 at a regular theater is still too much. I would say that waiting until it hits videos would be what this movie is worth. If you want to get the theater experience at a price that is worth it, wait until it is available at Redbox, Blockbuster, or on Netflix and watch it on a projector sized TV screen. Only THEN will it be worth the cost.But you don't have to take MY word for it...",Oz the Great and Powerful

433,quezadawife,My kids loved it!!!,7,8 March 2013,"I won't claim this movie to be great. But I thought it was good family fun and my kids really enjoyed it. This brings me to my first point. The acting wasn't the best nor do i think it the worst. There were some good characters portrayed well and then some not so good ones. I thought the animation was wonderful and bright. It was imaginative. Some said simple. Maybe, but sometimes less is more. In fact, there were a few times I think there was too much. Like more magic than the original Oz might have had. I know a lot of people complained about the storyline. I on the other hand thought the storyline was quite good. Sure there were some areas where it was predictable or as an adult you might think stupid or silly. But then again the movie was made as a family movie. I may not have been surprised, but my kids were. The last thing I wanted to comment on was the complaints about sexual innuendo and the morale of he story. People this is a movie for entertaining. It is not meant to be a life lesson teaching movie on morale. It is to entertain. You want to teach your kids about life morales then by all means. But you shouldn't bash a movie for mild subject matter (rewatch some of your classic favs to see what i mean) or tight clothes that your kids see everyday any ways as thy walk down the street.

I was NOT a big fan of this movie. James Franco did an excellent job as did Michelle Williams and joey King...her China Doll character was adorable! BUT the rest of the cast over acted or just showed how type cast they really are...Meg. The story line isn't bad. I did enjoy seeing just how Oz becomes Wizard and the journey he goes on to find himself. It just didn't correlate to his real life , like Dorothy's story lines did in the previous movies (and books). And the CGI... oh the CGI... There is unnecessary computer animation throughout the film. The Witches hard across the table, the field of Horse of a Different Color (Didn't even walk, they floated...kinda) The ""Venus Fly Trap"" flowers with eyes, the pixies, the witch coming out of the fire... you get the idea.... It was more distracting than anything, like they ran out of money and used dry erase markers to draw in the gaps.

I could not imagine watching this movie in standard viewing. There is so much to take in viewing it in 3D. Just as the original was a breakthrough for color movies, this prequel delivers in Oz fashion for 3D.I love the way the format mimics the original, yet remains independent for younger viewers who haven't grown up with the Wizard.

Unlike many others I enjoyed the story line and was completely enthralled. Critics said that people of my generation would not like it, probably because I was supposed to be so married to ""The Wizard of Oz."" This a completely different take on the Baum stories. Yes, it is a prequel of sorts, but is also original. The music in the ""Wizard of Oz"" was wonderful and I was pleased that they did not try to improve on the musical version. This is not a movie for very young children, it is too intense in places and will frighten them. Williams was great was Glenda, and a ""just a trifle"" more alluring than Billie Burke. Written by a 66 year-old kid at heart.",Oz the Great and Powerful
442,emilysuz,"A good movie. Some flaws, but not what others suggest...",8,17 March 2013,"I must say I was intrigued when the announcement came that Disney would once again tackle the Oz stories. I was a little skeptical when I saw how much CGI would be used but I also must add that I was pleasantly surprised. The sepia to full color was a nice touch. While it is fully understandable that Disney had some tough limitations regarding the copyright issues with Warner Brothers, I feel Disney came through quite well. After reading some of the previous reviews, I must respectfully disagree with most of them. I absolutely loved Rachel Weiz as Evanora. She couldn't have been more spot on for that role! And while everyone seemed to disapprove of Mila Kunis as Theodora, I greatly enjoyed her role as the naive younger sister manipulated by the truly evil Evanora. When Kunis makes her famous transition to the green tinted villain we are all familiar with, the scene I'll agree was quite laughable. Between the off green color (again, because of legal issues) and the CGI seemed especially poor for that scene instead of blending into the background like the rest of the movie, the scene lost momentum and seemed quite choppy. The other disappointment I found was Michelle Williams' portrayal of Glinda. Not only was this actress unattractive as the fair faced witch of the South (she was much prettier as the farm girl with Oscar's heart), but her mind numbing, monotonous voice repeating the same message of redemption several times throughout the movie is plain tiresome. For such a main character, Glinda didn't really do anything. Apparently her entire role served the purpose of providing nagging inspiration to our reluctant wizard in the form of ""if you're the man we think you are, you'll think of something."" Other than that, she made fog and whined a lot. As for the other characters, Finley and China Doll made decent humorous companions. In fact, the scene where Oz meets the young China Doll was quite touching and my personal favorite. This is a fine movie and worth a watch. And I look forward to the next one. (This IS Disney after all...Do they ever stop at one when it makes tons of money at the box office??) Perhaps they can shed some light on who Anne and John Gale are (I thought it was Uncle Henry and Auntie Em), whatever happened to Evanora before Dorthy's arrival and how Evanora got a hold of Glinda's not so ruby slippers (again, legal issues). There's lots of books so plenty of opportunity for good story telling in our future.",Oz the Great and Powerful

444,madisynl,Disappointing,3,9 March 2013,"I love the originally Wizard of Oz. The way it's filmed, the characters, and the whole style of the MUSICAL! How can you make a prequel to one of the best classics ever without music? Worse, how can you make a prequel, with so little ties to the original? There's no reference to the classic movie. No ruby slippers or striped stockings. It would have been easier to just make a movie about pretty witches, probably would of been better. Visually, the movie was beautiful. A little to Alice in Wonderland like, but pretty. The most enjoyable characters were the ones that were cgi. The glass doll and the flying monkey had me laughing a couple times. However James Franco did not. They couldn't find any other man to play Oz? Honestly anyone could have done a better job? He's acting was so terrible that the actresses in the movie had to dumb down their talent so he didn't seem so bad. I love Mila Kunis, but she's a adorable not wicked so her role as the wicked witch left me wanting, just like the terrible make up job they did on her. The movie over all was okay, I guess. I did almost fall asleep a couple of times. I also did catch the references to the scarecrow (the villagers), the tin man (the tinkers), and the cowardly lion (Oz scares away at the beginning of the movie), but it didn't make up for the fact that this film was just no good.",Oz the Great and Powerful
445,RygarMorte,A few yellow bricks short of what it could have been.,5,21 March 2013,"Sam Raimi's directorial prowess. Danny Elfman's familiar yet always inspired musical stylings. Bruce Campbells ability to make even the most mediocre cameo part glow with legendariness. The always stunning Rachel Weisz, and the deliciously cheesy grin of James Franco. Millions of dollars and incredible CGI capabilities with which to recreate the magic of the wonderful, wonderful Land of Oz for a whole new generation...And Mila Kunis' cleavage.Seems like a recipe for success. However, I expected a little more from this film.It's not the fact that it didn't really stay close to any of the other Oz movies. How could they? A happy-go-lucky, ring-around-the-rosy musical like the 1939 MGM classic wouldn't make any money these days. Disney would probably be driven bankrupt by another high-octane nightmare fuel interpretation like 1985's cult classic Return to Oz (although, if anyone were to remake that film, Sam Raimi would have my vote). It's not the cheap, in-your-face 3D effects, either. Honestly, I don't understand why people complain about this. I think it's pretty cool when stuff comes flying out at you, or when the movie turns into speeding roller coaster of a P.O.V. shot.It's the fact that it's sooo tedious. Seriously, they really cranked the melodrama up to eleven with this one. I mean, I know that Sam Raimi's films are prone to having their cheesy, obviously-here-to-progress-the- plot moments, but this took it a little too far. At times I felt like I was watching a television drama rather than a multi-million dollar budget, 3D cinematic fantasy spectacle.And that's what this movie should have been, a spectacle. That's what the MGM classic was, for viewers of the time. That film was cutting edge special effects, memorable characters and lots and lots of fun moments.Now, again, I'm not saying this film was bad because it's not like the MGM movie. I'm just saying that the direction this movie went in was not, to me, the spirit of Oz. If any of you have ever read L. Frank Baums original novel, or it's sequels, you know what I'm talking about. The book is, first and foremost, a comedy. The characters are absurd, and the world they inhabit is an illogical one, much like Lewis Carrol's Wonderland, only less seemingly LSD-inspired.Oz: The Great and Powerful gets the whole fantasy aspect of Oz by the ass, perhaps better than any other adaptation, but the comedy aspect is awkward. It isn't funny and lighthearted enough to be put in the same league as Baum's novels, but then again, it isn't serious enough to be taken as a darker and edgier interpretation, like Return to Oz. It has much the same vibe as Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland, only unlike that film, which operated on the basis that it was a thrilling fantasy film of pure spectacle, this movie takes itself too seriously, with bad melodrama taking up far too much runtime.The melodrama actually reminded me a lot of one of Burton's other recent films, the Dark Shadows movie. Now, that kind of worked okay, at least for me, perhaps because I had never seen the television show. I think that knowing the source material or not can heavily effect the impression a film has on you, and this is no exception. I grew up with the Oz books; the humour and the fantasy of this world Baum had constructed was like the illogical absurdity of Carrol's Alice mixed with the characters and magical settings of the Harry Potter series. And that was incredibly badass. However, this movie doesn't seem to understand what made the Oz series great. It was the humour, and the fairy-tale atmosphere. The way the scarecrow explained with complete seriousness that his lack of a brain restricted him to making completely obvious statements. The way that every little detail was explained as sort of it's own story, from the origin of the Tin Woodman to how the Winged Monkey's had been enslaved by the Wicked Witch of the West. The way that Dorothy explained to her straw and tin friends that Toto was ""a meat dog"". It was such a charming little world, but it was also magical and exciting in its fantasy.Now there are lots and lots of moments where this film gets that more or less right (the fantasy, if not the comedy), but too often it does not. The jokes are more comic relief than anything, and the fantasy is pushed aside to make way for what seem like deleted scenes from The Bold and the Beautiful.However, all this criticism doesn't change the fact that this is an enjoyable movie, despite being a bad one. I came out of the theatre smiling, and it's only when you start to take it too seriously (which the movie already does enough far too much for any of us) that you realize how bad it is. This film is great for what it is, but it's also terrible for what it could have been. In the book, the wizard calls himself not ""Oz: The Great and Powerful"" but ""Oz: The Great and Terrible"". I think that about sums up this movie. Sure, it's contrived, formulaic and melodramatic, but it's fun enough for what it is.",Oz the Great and Powerful

Awesome piece of entertainment with emotional depth.,10,20 March 2013,"I went into the theater to watch Sam Raimi's Oz: The Great and Powerful with lower expectations, honestly.

I am happy to say this was not at all a disappointment. From lots of great references to this film's classic predecessor and to classic film in general, to great writing, special effects and awesome performances.

Sam Raimi tries his best with his directing and he does an admirable job with all that was on his plate but not even he could have made this weak film fly thanks to a script that does not know what to do with itself. The writing is just unbearable in certain scenes and the structure does not hold up, especially with one of the big reveals about a certain character towards the middle of the movie. Its does not help at all that there is some major casting missteps along the way, like the main character himself played by James Franco, who is just wrong for the role. He does not give off an ounce of acting talent or decency at all with the role of Oscar Diggs (Who becomes Oz) and just very bad in the role. Mila Kunis is also badly cast as Theodora (One of the witches) and her transformation in the film as the wicked witch of the west is so badly done that it is hard not to laugh when it happens. The only actors in this film who manages to give this film some dignity and acting talent is Rachel Weisz, who takes her character of Evanora (a bad witch) and actually gives the film the only ounce of fun it has, making the movie more bearable to sit though and Michelle Williams, who takes the role of Glenda (the good witch) and makes it more enjoyable than it could have been because of how goo-die two shoes the character is.Its though the talents of both Williams and Weisz that this movie is barley passable and if they were not in it, the movie would have been almost impossible to sit through.",Oz the Great and Powerful

But where is the story ?? I was trying to find the story all throughout but couldn't find one. I wanted something elegant in storyline and take it up there. and i don think this one has exquisite screenplay to wonder about.

Not to be compared with the 1939 classic, this is a fantastic movie with a lot of heart, a bit of goodness, some magic, and some trickery. Join Oz, Finley the monkey, and China Girl (my favorite character) as they walk across the yellow brick road to defeat the wicked witch. But beware, the wicked witch may not be the witch that it's supposed to be. The special effects are jaw dropping and you simply must watch this in 3D. Everything pops out at you and there were some scenes where I actually felt the need to duck. I've never seen the land of Oz look so real. Bottom line - gather your family and your friends and see this movie in 3D while it's in theaters. It's worth your money and your time.",Oz the Great and Powerful

The casting agency for this film could not of picked a better cast. James Franco was amazing, and Mila Kunis was excellent as well. Rachel Weiss was a nice addition to the film and she rocked her role as well. Also the voice actors for the non human characters rocked their roles too. It's an all around great film for kids to adults alike. I recommended it highly for anyone who wants a laugh and suspense. The overall production from the sets to the CGI was perfection.

Movie was slow paced too for the whole first hour.3D effects were amazing all along. might be the only thing that is enjoyable in this movie apart from the gorgeous MW.It could have been much better, only if the plot is more stronger and the actors were correctly picked!

452,barnsleybird89,Disappointing,2,3 November 2013,"Was pretty gutted when i didn't get chance to go see this at the cinema as the trailers looked amazing.. but an hour into watching it on DVD and i'm somewhat disappointed, and rather glad i didn't go to the cinemathe only reason I've given it a 2 is because the visuals and effects are absolutely fantastic, the vision of oz and the emerald city is wonderful and plenty to take in, but the film is extremely lacking in the script and acting skills and daresay wrong choice of actors.i didn't understand how the film starts off in the early 1900's Kansas, but yet when he gets to oz the characters, language and costumes e.c.t seem to be more reminiscent of 2013.. (mila kunis dressed in a rather modern outfit of shirt, leathers and boots, and rather plain for a witch living in a mystical magical land) it lacked the quirkiness and sharp wit of the characters- the villainous plotting of the deceitful withes, and the cockiness of the so called 'great and powerful' i also felt it lacked the wonderment of Oz- when Dorothy arrives she is awestruck by this new and different world, but yet when oz arrives he settles in quite easily and not so impressed by his new discovery i do however, agree with the other comments about Rachel Weisz she absolutely steals the show, i just wished the other actors had put the same amount of effort into their characters. To say the film is supposed to be a 'prequel' story to the wizard of oz and Dorothy's arrival.. i don't really understand the jump, its seems they have took things forward not backward. Its a long movie and the storyline gets quite boring at times. Maybe i am just sceptical as the original was one of my favourite films as a child and still love watching it, but now I've seen this once i wont be watching it again in a hurry. My advice is to watch the film just to see the amazing effects but don't go in expecting too much from the characters..",Oz the Great and Powerful
453,AngelaGraye,"Over the top, but pleasantly unexpected.",7,4 March 2013,"Vibrant colors, innovative use of 3D techniques, and good balance of comedy and suspense make Oz the Great and Powerful on my surprise ""likes"" for the season. Keeping true to the original 1939 Wizard of Oz, while creating a new vision of his own, Sam Raimi pulled off a rare prequel gem. No one breaks out in song, the sidekicks are surprisingly helpful with Oz's character development, and with a well written script as well, this story brings to life a new side of Oz that add clout to the classic. This film is certainly worth a watch. They managed to keep away from over the top characters, 3D graphics that jump out at you around every corner, and pointless fan pandering. There are several settle hints that pay homage to the original and tie the two together.The casting was spot on. James Franco plays that witty conman who becomes Oz. Rachel Weisz and Mila Kunis bring the wicked witch sisters to life. Michelle Williams gives Glinda a delicate demeanor while staying true to her cleverness and understand. A character that I feel doesn't get as much attention as he should is Finley the monkey. He is voiced by Zach Braff whom also has a small part as Frank. This character spends most of the film with Oz and is very much a part of the wizards overall character arc. He does a great job with the roll and certainly deserves to be noted.On a personal note, I thought this film was going to be over the top with bad characters and a director that would TRY to emulate the original. I was pleasantly surprised to be taken over the rainbow to a new Oz with exciting creatures, unexpected towns, and a story that, in the end, brought me back home to Kansas. (OMG Help! How did I get here? I went into a theater in Florida and came out in Kansas? Wait Is this Kansas the state, or city Oh no Not again! Nuts!!!!)",Oz the Great and Powerful
454,chris4050,"Pretty Darn Good, Only a few flaws",8,9 March 2013,"Went to a viewing Thursday.I had HUGE expectations for the movie and actually most of them were fulfilled!The 3D and the effects were amazing! I loved all of the little nods that their were for the original! The black and white converting into full colour and widescreen was also another great idea. The acting was pretty good I thought throughout. James Franco was actually pretty good, many say he was miscast and I don't understand why?He was pretty great,nothing special but pretty good for what was given.His friend a flying monkey, played by the guy from Scrubs had everyone laughing he was really funny! The china girl was good also, many say her part is really the core and heart of the film. Michelle playing Glenda was very good , you could see that she was trying her hardest to live up to her role. Rachel Weiz...she was good but I was actually mad at the script writers for having her more present than her sister. Rachel was great at playing a bad witch but when she became ugly at the end it was just weird and people were laughing cause she looked like an old man.So....throughout all of this I was the most excited for Mila Kunis, hearing that she would become the Wicked Witch Of The West was something that I thought was great...but when it came to screen...it was odd! The dialogue that was given to her was horrible! I will not blame her for that!But loving Kunis I will say that she wasn't the worst of the cast but she wasn't at her best! I thought that she was either on point or VERY OFF. Her transformation sequence was great...but I feel that she could of put more emotion in it. I am sorta left speechless about her performance...it isn't good or bad...?I really don't know?I simply wished that I could of loved her part better! But I did appreciate that her last words said in the entire movie were on point and not VERY OFF. Basically the movie was A LOT of fun everyone should see it!

The whole thing transforms itself into a HD cinemascope movie when the Oz, the protagonist enters the wonderland (in this case, land of Oz).Like all of Disney's fairy tales, this movie has some beautifully dressed princesses who all fall for the protagonist, Oz. Though the director seems to have censored all raunchy scenes and just left the kissing ones to give the movie a U/A rating.The main actresses in this movie are Rachel Weisz, Michelle Williams and Mila Kunis, who all look stunning in their dresses except Mila Kunis, who seemed under dressed in a fairy tale.

456,xyno-nax,It's okay,7,25 March 2013,"This movie is a fine piece of work to look at, unfortunately the plot leaves a lot to be desired. It's a movie intended for kids, so adults should not expect much from it. The movie focuses a lot on looking great instead of focusing on the plot and character development itself, which is a pity. As a children's movie it also really could use some music, and with the plot it would probably work a lot better as a musical of sorts than what it really is. I have not seen the original Oz movie so I don't know how that one is, but I just felt that this movie would have been a nicer movie had it either had music in it or been something like an hour shorter than it was, as the plot itself was very thin. During the movie there was something like 4 times where people actually laughed at something in the movie, which is very little for a movie of over 2 hours, they seemed to try at some comical things at some points which mostly just wasn't all that funny. Overall though I kind of liked it still, it was a cute movie even with its massive flaws, I don't regret going to see it, but I also cannot recommend it to others, without at least letting them know what I actually think of it.",Oz the Great and Powerful

This movies transports you to so many places in time and space it's hard to explain.All I can say is go with it.James Franco delivers a wonderful performance and has moved on so far since his awful Spiderman days. It would seem his time with Danny Boyle not only brought about a wonderful film in 127 hours but also made the man.Rachael Weisz is stunningly beautiful and also married to the most famous Liverpool fan of all time. James Bond. Sorry about that - couldn't resist. Seriously though, she rarely disappoints and has delivered again on a scale similar to the Brothers Bloom.As for Mila Kunis, she excelled towards the end of the movie but once again was fairly plain.Overall, this is what going to the cinema is all about. I just hope this generation gets as much joy as the previous 3-4 generation got from the Wizard of Oz. The nod to the musical element of the Wizard of Oz was neatly done not over done. Well done Disney. A good recovery from John Carter and captured the original magic completely. Thank goodness they are in charge of the next Star Wars trilogy which Lucas got so dreadfully wrong.",Oz the Great and Powerful

The only thing that drew me in was Joey King's character. Nothing else about this movie really had me paying attention while I was watching it. One of the major annoyances to me was I could plainly see when there was CG/green screen going on. In this day and age it's unavoidable, but being able to see it really bothers me. I wouldn't call a waste of time, but the only thing that I can say to accurately describe it is ""average."" Before it came out I was expecting a flop. I guess I was wrong, but I think the main thing that drew people in was nostalgia and the Disney name.",Oz the Great and Powerful
460,davidcorreia7,As good as one would expect it to be,7,11 June 2013,"I will begin by saying one thing. This movie made me happy. And for me, that's almost all I can ask from a movie. James Franco is definitely a great actor. Period. At first I had my doubts about why he had been cast, but as soon as the screen changed from black and white to a mesmerizing display of colors I understood - he believed in the movie, and so did I. And after all, it's what it's all about - believing, and if you just don't get the power of belief, just don't watch it. It took me 3 tries to watch the movie from beginning to end. So I could say the beginning was fairly slow, sometimes not very appealing, but still, it carried through. Then the great world of Oz came, in some manner resembling Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland, but still a joy for the eyes. The imagination put into this storyline was nothing but spectacular. Yes, it has it's faults. I agree that some references to the tin man and the lion (apart from the obvious one at the beginning) were in order. But people, please don't expect this movie to be the same as the other one. That's what film making is all about. It's about being innovative and creative and this one certainly stands up to the task.Nevertheless, I have to express my disappointment at the casting of Mila Kunis. I just don't believe these sorts of roles are for her. So, in all, it was a good movie. Especially in 3D. Keep them coming.",Oz the Great and Powerful
461,satchelpage413,A dud.,3,9 March 2013,"I really had high hopes for this movie. It was set up to be a lot better than the final product. Franco's lead turned out to be more of an unlikeable person rather than one who, while obviously flawed, was worthy of our sympathy. He hammed up his role in sort of a trolling way.The dialogue was forced, as well as the overall flow of the story. Nothing seemed natural. Visually, it was impressive, though some may find it a little over the top. However, visual effects are no longer enough to make a decent movie. As far as the comedic aspects, you'll find yourself being forced to laugh as the jokes were just as rigid as the script. The lines weren't particularly funny. The laughter is more a product of the movie-watching culture, ie, ""this is the point where we normally laugh"".Being a lifelong fan of Baum's classic, Oz left me feeling like I watched the movie because I was supposed to. It was a part of protocol. Not that I would necessarily enjoy it. And that's generally the spirit of the entire movie. Let's stiffly read through this script. Let's emote when we are supposed to. Let's make it visually stunning. Not to enhance this magical land, but it's because what movies do now.",Oz the Great and Powerful

Neither manage to defy gravity but the rest of the cast were pleasant, especially Weisz - even with her Emperor-like green force lightning. It would have been a more visually stunning Oz had the effects been simplified. Conversely, the story lacked depth and with some rather clumsy dialogue (especially for Kunis), it was all perhaps a little too light and ""Disney"".Doesn't quite get the ruby slipper, but maybe 3 out of 5 wands.",Oz the Great and Powerful

Doesn't really make sense to me unless its the character roles he gets that I like and he then does a reasonably good job at them. This movie isn't Great but it is Good, and after watching you may understand what I mean. It's the story of the Wizard and his arrival and adventures in Oz before Dorothy gets there. The china doll and the ""good monkey"" are charming companions for Oz's journey which at least initially reminds one of Dorothy's journey in the later story. Good ultimately triumphs over evil which is a requisite for these types of fairy tales. The film moved at a good pace, it was visually stimulating but not overly so, and a good time was had by all, except perhaps Milan Kunis and Rachael Weisz. Might be a bit scary for kids under 10, but I tend to think very old fashioned about that sort of thing. I'd watch it again. It made me now want to read all the Frank Baum Oz books.

464,keyvy,Free your mind and the rest wont follow *SPOILERS*,4,1 June 2013,"This film should be judged by the name of this review. That's exactly what it is: it's missing a sense of whimsy - the creators could've been mote creative with the costumes, imaginative with the scenery and the details, not just copy the major costume designs from the original ""Oz"" movie. They really could've let their freak flag fly, but what do they do? Design costumes for the witches that are mostly (98%, to be exact) glitter and shiny beads. The quality of Mila Kunis' performance is debatable, Rachel Weisz puts the wicked in witch (even though her lack of elegance kinda ruins her appeal to the viewer), and what about Oz - the great and powerful? He is as big a jerk as he would've been if he ran off in the end. There's one scene (OK, three scenes) that especially trouble(s) me: in the end Oz is seen giving gifts to his friends, and what does the monkey get? The hat and his friendship! What!!? That's what he gets for carrying that darn bag all over oz while being chased by a bipolar witch??! That's not my point, all I want to say is that Oz is really that an egomaniac and big headed and if you expect that to change during the course of the movie, you'll be very disappointed. And also, this is not a kids' movie. Especially not in Real 3-D. And also, it is not said that time in the land passes faster than the time in our land, so how come the age difference between Kunis and Weisz as sisters in this feature is about 106 yrs.?",Oz the Great and Powerful

The acting of the human characters is second rate.The Wizard of OZ with Judy Garland, has acting and characters that are believable. The old movie was a family movie, children being able to enjoy the wonder of all that went on, and adults could enjoy it to as it had quality actors and quality acting.

The effects are low-budget, lines with no humor, and the actors seem like they received vouchers, that's how much interest they've invested in their role. Hottie Mila Kunis in the first part of the film is in the role of a sweet, innocent being, dressed in latex and the second part is changed in a so-called witch mutant. The main figure, the one that the whole story evolves, this wizard of Oz, serves as a hypocritical, greedy and lecherous human being . They say the film is made ​​by Disney and would be dedicated to children but I think if a child sees this so-called movie, it's gonna cry.

The cast was brilliant but they must have not been too excited to do this movie as their acting skills were just terrible. The only one that did a decent job was Rachel Weisz.

However, this story was very boring, there were not any laughing moments, I really enjoy mila as an actor in other movies, but she does not convey any wicked witchedness to the audience. Her delivery of the role was laughable, really, cause it was not scary in the least bit. James Franco's role was flat, his character is suppose to evolve, but really he did not change. Do not waste your time with this movie, if anything go watch it online or wait till it comes out on netflix. Just to prove my point, the theater was filled with over a dozen children ages all under 12, they did not seem entertained by this movie, I was happy for it to end, any longer and I would have fallen asleep.",Oz the Great and Powerful

I mean, the guy didn't even seem to try (I hope he wasn't for his sake) to be the least bit warm or believable or genuine (I know this was part of the character but seriously?) and i could go on and on but I won't because I have to go watch some MTV trash like Jersey Shore before the memory of this catastrophe becomes permanent and requires a frontal lobotomy.So to conclude:James Franco.

472,Nemonofsweden,"Not a bad movie, but not in any way a masterpiece either.",6,16 March 2013,"Okey, first things first - Oz the Great and Powerful is not a bad movie. It has got plenty of qualities such as stunning visuals, some solid acting and quite a few memorable characters. Let's start with the visuals. They are simply breathtaking. I am usually not a big fan of overusing cgi since it often make the movie feel kind of impersonal but i cannot simply see any other way to make this film work. Each frame feels like a painting and is filled with fantastic colors, details, great camera-work and amazing backdrops. I can't imagine the countless hours the artists has spent perfecting each and every frame from the beginning to the last minute.Something i noticed when about ten minutes of the film remained was that there was not any point during the movie when i felt bored. Oz, the Great and Powerful is like driving a sports car really fast and has more in common with last years ""Tintin"" than the 1939 original. The tempo is really high and there are almost no quiet moments.It has got some severe problems that drags down the overall impression though. While James Franco is one of my favorite actors of this generation the decision of putting him in the role as the great wizard of oz was not a good one. His character is supposed to be this kind of lazy, charming yet good-hearted man but instead come of as somewhat dumb and slow. He never really get into his role and often seems to feel uncomfortable which become strikingly obvious when his two sidekicks, a cgi monkey (voiced by Zach Braff) and a porcelain-doll gives by far more memorable performances then Franco.The real show-stealer is Rachel Weisz and while her performance certainly won't grant her an Oscar, she really stands out from the rest and gives a very solid and worthy interpretation as the witch Elanora. I am not yet sure which purpose Mila Kunis role as Theodora served. Her character never really develops and the few moments Raimi lets her do so it's over way too fast and we never really get the chance to know her.The biggest problem with the film, however is the script which unfortunately is paper-thin. I never expected this to be Oscar material since it's a movie mainly aimed at kids but most of the characters are just too dull and the plot too uninteresting. It feels like a first draft and should have been rejected before it was actually filmed.In the end however i had fun with Oz the Great and Powerful and thats what matters most when watching these kinds of family movies. I walked out of the theater with a big fat smile on my face and while i can't overlook some the more severe problems the film has it's enough to make me satisfied and reward it with a strong 6. It might also be viewed as a weak 7.",Oz the Great and Powerful
473,rchurchouse,More Oz same only different,3,10 March 2013,"First let's get the pleasantries out of the way. I watch a lot of movies. I have kids. I like Disney's products. I have read many of the user reviews on this film and for the most part whole heartedly agree with many of their points of view.I went into the film hoping I would like it. Yes sometimes a preconception can disappoint, but with a film like this you need to have strong hopes that it will deliver the box office result that the industry needs.The films opening sequences are great. The black and white and the reveal to the colorful world of OZ was great but then slowly but surely the film started to go downhill from there. The story was weak and the acting was average from actors that can do so much better. James Franco was out acted by the CGI flying monkey (Zac Braff would have made a better OZ?). And the rest of the cast seemed to phone it in.Now you can try and save the film by pointing out things like cinematography, 3D effects, costumes (expect some dodgy leather pants which I think were there for the adult male audience) and the score all you like. But at the end of the day the film must engage the audience and it just doesn't. It plays too old for little kids and too young for older kids with too much adult dialogue and it is just to long - 90 minutes people is the family formula! It will suit the people who watched the original and who are now taking their grandkids to the film - the type of person who does not get out much these days and to whom ""talkies"" are still quite a novelty.Instead of reinventing the wheel they should have made the stage show WICKED into the film rather than hinting at it around the edges. Perhaps the idea of making a Witch the central figure of the film has to wait until Angelina Jolie is revealed in Maleficent.",Oz the Great and Powerful
474,nancymikolasik,Excellent Prequel,9,7 March 2013,"Just saw it and loved it. Exactly what I would expect from a prequel to the Wizard of Oz. It was beautiful, well acted, funny, serious, heartwarming and heartbreaking. The writing was superb! I thought the ""green"" color was right on for the wicked witch (I've seen a lot of critiques against her makeup), and I was glad to see so many small connections between this film and the original. Personally, I expected to see some things carry over from the ""old to the new."" Slight spoiler here: My only critique would be the very ending, that last relationship is not seen in The Wizard of Oz. Adding it at the end of the prequel does make the original a little confusing - because there is no evidence it ever existed. Other than that, Oz the Great and Powerful is one of my top favorite films of all times! BTW - the 3-D effects are excellent and D-Box was fun and even a little scary at times!",Oz the Great and Powerful
475,Stablenut,OZ-some!,9,8 March 2013,"I loved it, would see it again in a heartbeat. It was a very enjoyable two hours, escaping to that land of Oz once again. The movie pays homage to the original, yet maintains a storyline that is familiar, but new. There are elements of the Baum books along with the newer ""Wicked"" books / Broadway show. I won't go into details since it opens tomorrow. My only complaint would be with the costuming; except for one dazzling initial outfit that Mila Kunis wears, most of the costumes play second fiddle to the dazzling Land of Oz. Michelle Williams' blond wig left something to be desired also, but then again...maybe it was a wink at Judy Garland's wigs as Dorothy - in other words, obvious. Go - enjoy - and be glad we have people willing to make good entertainment like this - like movies used to be!The 3D was great - a positive enhancement, much like Avatar.",Oz the Great and Powerful
476,kjkelley31,Beautiful work and good fun ... just wicked miscasting,8,8 March 2013,"I'll admit I didn't do a whole lot of homework on this movie before I went to go see it. The preview's stunning visuals were enough to impress upon me that this might be a good ""day off from work"" movie that would entertain and intrigue. In the end, I was right. What almost ruined it for me were the obvious clichés in the script, too cute to be true sidekicks, and the miscasting of Mila Kunis as Theodora.Oz the Great and Powerful is about a philandering con-man named Oscar Diggs (James Franco) who does a magical act for a traveling circus that goes about black and white Kansas. He woos every girl he meets with magic tricks, sweet talk, and conniving. The only girl who can see through him is Annie (Michelle Williams), yet even she shows some feelings for him before she regretfully tells him she is marrying someone else. Oscar is an immature magician who is fully aware of his handicaps. Nor does he seem very observant. As everyone else outside the circus grounds gets pushed around by tornado winds, he tries to go on about his business as a man comes after him for breaking the heart of another girl. He only becomes fully aware of the tornado when he realizes that the hot air balloon he hopped onto is heading straight toward it. Right in the worst of the storm, he pleads with God, telling him he will do things right this time. In response, God sends him to the land of Oz where the world becomes all color and no more black and white. There, it is prophesied that a wizard of the same name as their land will kill a wicked witch and free the land.The movie ""had me"" there. The visuals were stunning, and the story had momentum going for it. Oscar had nothing at this point to go back to, no job or the lady he truly loved. He was now in a land where he could redeem himself. Theodora, a good witch at this part of the story, had even gone after him, having seen his balloon crash into a far off river. Being as beautiful as she was, Oscar dared not tell her that he was not the wizard prophesied about. Instead, as he had done before, he romances her. She instantly falls for his romantic tricks and leads him to the Emerald City to meet with her sister, Evanora (Weisz), ready to celebrate that the prophesied wizard had come to save them from the evil Wizard named Glinda (Williams again).I was getting sick of Theodora at this point. I really couldn't believe she was that naive and quick to fall in love. Why didn't she ever really doubt him? And what back story did she have? Her character was wooden, simple and one-dimensional. If someone else had played Theodora, I may have even had some sympathy for the girl that eventually becomes the real Wicked Witch.My fears that this movie was going to be terrible were assuaged when I finally got to meet Evanora and later on Glinda. I now have Weisz on my To Watch list! She pulled off a complex character of someone who had hopes that Oscar was the prophesied man, but was overall evil at heart and had no good intentions for others around her. Being as conniving as Oscar herself, the complicated relationship between the two of them was well done.Glinda, the supposed evil queen who turns out to be good, immediately showed off an intelligence and perception that I don't see in too many other movie characters. Her amount of faith in Oscar seems right in the middle somewhere, sure but not sure, and yet ends up being enough faith to bring him - finally - willing to engage in the battle against Evanora and eventually also Theodora.The story that gets you to the climax battle scenes, however, dragged, and the characters we meet - while they have roles to play - have their moments of being quite annoying. The China doll girl seems bi-polar as she cries helplessly for one half the movie and get feisty and courageous in the other half. Finley, the good-hearted flying monkey, makes you laugh in good ways for most of the movie but still faintly reminds you of the original evil flying monkeys in ""Wizard of Oz."" Overall, though, I liked Finley the best out of Oscar's companions. The bad clichés in the script came in the war preparations for how Oscar will deceive the evil witches. Of course, it had to mention scarecrows as their fighting men. Of course he built another hot air balloon for his own escape plan. Of course there were fireworks and references to making moving pictures. What is it with Hollywood always tipping the hat to themselves for movie-making anyway? And of course we get the hint that sequels are going to be made when Oscar tries to woo back the evil Theodora to being good again.Let me clarify here, however, that I did enjoy this movie! It was a good storyline that just simply fell flat in parts of the execution. The visuals, CGI, and the acting of Weisz and Williams were superb. Franco also had his moments of intelligent acting. The play with the prequel story was, overall, fun to watch.Bring your 10-year old kids and up to this movie. There is great attention to its visual creativity, imagination, and the moral that you don't have to identify with a bad past but can push forward to make things right. Just be aware you might cringe here and there at some of the movie's obviousness.",Oz the Great and Powerful
477,jasmineleighwilliams,"Expensive Movie, Cheap Actors",3,8 March 2013,"The movie is too young for adults and too old for kids. Mila and James cannot carry a movie and were often overshadowed by the supporting cast. I often felt like I was watching a play and the audience laughed at the cheesy jokes. But, I was actually in a 15 dollar IMAX movie and it was not up to par. I expected so much more. Who cast Mila Kunis as the wicked witch? And James Franco was corny. Their intentions were good but it had no direction. It wasn't quite enough of one thing to flow. It was bad acting, cheesy jokes (which the supporting cast presented wonderfully), cool effects that delayed the storyline, and an empty ending. It was a poor execution all the way around. Without the supporting cast the movie would have been a walk out.",Oz the Great and Powerful

479,destroyeroftoast,A great trip back to Oz,8,10 March 2013,"Now I have love The Wizard of Oz (1939) my entire life. As a child I also enjoy Return to Oz but now looking back I cant say why exactly. I have been looking forward to this movie ever since I heard it was being developed. So I finally get my ticket for Oz the Great and Powerful. The day before I go see the movie, I decide I'm going to look at what the critics are saying. So I did and I was so upset with what I was reading. After reading what the critics were saying all my hope for this movie had gone away. My friends and I sit down in the theater. The previews go away and the movie starts. I had the biggest smile on my face to see that the beginning was in black and white. It almost brought tears to my eyes. The first 20 minutes or so take place in a circus in Kansas. The set was beautifully done. They do a very nice job of setting up the character of Oscar Diggs (Oz). In the 1939 classic Oz is made out to be a humbug and a cheat. I feel that James Franco pulls this off very well. So Oscar is eventually swept away to the land of Oz. When he lands he meets a very attractive witch, Theodroa. She tells him of a prophecy of a wizard who will come and set things right in the land of Oz. He being the man that he is goes along with it. On the way to the emerald city he meets a flying monkey named Finley; voiced by Zach Braff. He is the voice of reason to Oscar and he also adds some comedy to the film. Theodroa, Oscar, and Finley arrive to the emerald city to meet with Theodroa's sister Evenora. Evenora tells Oscar before he can take the thrown he has to defeat the wicked witch. So Oscar and his newly found friend Finley set off into the land of Oz to find and kill the wicked witch. But they may be in for more than they ever expected. Oscar will have to rise to a challenge and be more than just a good mad, he will have to become a great one. I really enjoyed this movie. I have no complaints about the acting in this movie and the CGI was spot on. I loved the feeling of seeing the yellow-brick road and emerald city again. It is a movie of redemption and how anyone can be great. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone. If you have kids they will love it and I think most adults will enjoy it to. This movie is no where near as good as The Wizard of Oz but why should it have to be. The Wizard of Oz is near and dear to many peoples hearts, including mine. It is a near perfect movie and one of the best story's of all time. I think thats why the critics were so disappointed in this movie. I however see it as a good story of the land of Oz. Oz has so many stories to be told and this is only the beginning.",Oz the Great and Powerful

It looked good, but I'm not the kind of college student you'll find at a fantasy movie. I looked at the reviews on this website. I was shocked to find how negative the reviews were. A few positive, not many. After that, I wanted to see how terrible it really was. I actually enjoyed the movie, awesome sets and backgrounds. The effects were amazing too. Well, my point is, those people are just being stupid and foolish. Personally, they don't have a brain! Just don't listen to them! You'll get a lot of action, some humor and it's amazing in 3D, so see it in 3D! A few jumps, don't let that stop you from seeing it! In the beginning, it starts off with a vintage charm with lovely black and white scene. Then Oz does his show and it starts off in color. Theodora sees his balloon fall out of the sky. It goes on and he makes two friends. Then, Theodora and her sister both end up evil, making Glinda the only good one. I don't want to spoil it too much.

I am being GENEROUS when I give it a 4/10. The camera angles and dramatic zoom-ins were atrocious and amateur. When actors stood next to CGI characters, the use of the green screen was painfully obvious. The anachronisms thrown into the story only added to the immaturity. On top of all that, the 3D was hardly even apparent; a few things pop out at you and that is that. All of this doesn't even include the acting.I am a huge James Franco and Mila Kunis fan, but their acting was not even up to par in this film. The cheesy smiles and calculated dialogue felt lifeless; a child with no experience could have performed better.Worst of all, due to the fact that Oz has already grossed so much money, Disney is planning a sequel. AFTER ONE WEEKEND. I would not want anyone to spend $9 per ticket on this movie; it is painful to watch and a complete let-down.",Oz the Great and Powerful

With the actors chosen for this movie I expected a lot more. I felt as if i was in a Kindergarden production. The camera angles were very armature and the use of green screens were obvious. At least 20 people in our theater walked out, some flicking off the screen as they went. It left me wondering when the movie was going to end! The only reason we stayed was to give it time to improve which it did not. Im seriously surprised that this movie was released in that kind of condition.

484,valoric1,Good stand alone movie,6,11 March 2013,"Oz the Great and Powerful delivered in a stand alone way. By itself it would hold to any of the fantasy movies of today. Combining stunning graphics with an unseen plot that even the critics couldn't ignore. Mila Kunis portrays a shockingly good role as the wicked witch of the west, while James Franco perfectly exemplifies the all mighty OZ.With all that being said, if the movie was pared with the 1939 classic then it is a complete failure. Little back story was actually explained and it leaves more questions than answers. The movie should have been cast into a 2 part. Part one consisting of the back story of OZ itself showing the fall of the last kingdom with OZ entering near the final 30 minutes and should have been from the aspect of the wicked witch of the west (this aspect is briefly portrayed at points in the movie). The second part could recap that 30 minutes from the perspective of the good witch then carried on with the story of how he became the all powerful OZ. Even after that there is a 30 year time line gap between the supposed start of the film and the creation of the classic. They would have to fill several gaps explaining back stories however to do this in a movie of it's own would be quite unentertaining.Overall a solid 6 for the acting and visual effects, but for anyone who enjoys the classic do not go in with high expectations.",Oz the Great and Powerful

I also read many critic reviews and they appear to be rating another movie, so I decided to be the first to write an accurate review of 'Oz the Great and Powerful'.Oz (James Franco) fit his trickster/womanizer role perfectly, a wonderful illusionist, less wizard, fitting the same Oz that Dorthy travels to see in the original 1939 'Wizard of Oz'.The switch of the witch of which witch was which was rather which... er, rich! I did not see the trickery in the prophecy to destroy the wand of the wicked witch. I was even more shocked to discover who the true wicked witch was, even when you think you figured it out...'Oz the Great and Powerful' does a wonderful job to tie in traces of the 1939 'Wizard of Oz' without crossing copyright lines with MGM. Multicolor horses, Glinda traveling in bubbles, and of course the famous yellow brick road! Even subtle traces of how the lion lost his courage and the creation of the scarecrow made me think back...In the end, 'Oz the Great and Powerful' was a fantastic movie to see with or without children. I even see opportunity for a sequel leading up to the arrival of Dorthy landing on a witch with ruby slippers...According to media, this movie cost 200M and made 150M worldwide on opening weekend!

I mean, it wasn't SO bad that I wouldn't spend money to rent it (maybe) or even better watch it on Netflix, but it was pretty bad to spend $8 a ticket to see. I couldn't believe how horrible some of the acting was. James Franco is not believable at all! And Mila - TERRIBLE! I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.

I don't recommend seeing this and if you want to don't waste your time or money seeing it in theaters. There were a few funny parts in the movie but most of the time I laughed from making fun of Mila Kunis. James Franco played an okay Oz he was funny but he wasn't the best choice for that character. I think the best performance was by Rachel Weisz. She played an amazing witch. Best by far. The only other problem I had with this movie was how the witches looked. When I think of a witch I think of an ugly old hag with wrinkles and a creepy face. I know it's a Disney movie and I'm sure tons of kids see this movie but Disney should not have made it in the first place.

It is also over 2 hrs long and gets so slow in certain parts.On a positive note, the backgrounds are so beautiful, and are really impressive from a movie, the likes of I have never seen.

As for the characters, again there needs to be more time building the personalities. We don't learn much about why any of them are feeling the way they feel. It is like we were looking at a story, but started from the middle instead of the beginning.The acting of all witches are flat, i don't know if it is because they got poor direction or if they just weren't inspired.

492,hbb-hb,L. Frank Baum is spinning in his grave!,1,14 March 2013,"Once again, Hollywood has come out with another horrific ""addition"" to the canon of classic children's stories. This awful prequel should be seen as another blemishment in Sam Raimi's career as a director. Once again, he's splattered cheesy special effects all over the screen in an attempt to impress the audience, but skips out on any type of depth of meaning. He still hasn't figured out that the magic of the movies comes out through the audience becoming engaged with the characters and the storyline, not by being overwhelmed by an over-expansive computer-generated world that looks like its made of plastic. James Franco and Mila Kunis should also be embarrassed by their utter lack of acting in this film. A half-hour into this tragedy and I was ready to leave the theatre. All the characters in the film seem like they're speaking their lines into the camera, probably a result of the fact that everything in the film looks like it was put into the film in post-production. I couldn't help but find it ironic that the screenwriters of Oz have the Kansas magician be tempted by the gold-filled riches of the Emerald City, but find the strength to resist. After viewing the film, all one can think of is how much Roth and Raimi sold out the magical, fantastical world of Oz for the evil riches that came with suckering the poor fans of the imagination of Baum with this over-bloated, horribly-written, poorly acted travesty of a film.

And the graphics the eye candy was not even all that good.

Sure I didn't love Kunis in the beginning, but she made up for it later in the movie. I don't love Franco in anything he plays - there's just some underlying ""something"" that turns me off, but he progressively endeared himself to me. But both Kunis and Oz's characters were ones that evolved as time went on, and I thought both actors succeeded in moving their characters forward. Loved the movie! One more thing, I usually hate any 3D movie that weren't directed by James Cameron, but Raimi did a pretty good job using 3D to both immerse you into the scene - and he also went for the cheap thrills of having things fly at you (which I typically don't like)-overall, it worked.",Oz the Great and Powerful

A time killer.As far as story goes this is pretty blah. Everything that happens is quite predictable, there really wasn't any moment during the film where I was on the edge of my seat asking myself what was going to happen next. It was a very transparent plot and at some points even dull.And the characters were so highly unbelievable that it's actually kind of sad. Glinda the Good Witch was forcing her goodness, and I'm sure that I've made better pain faces just from opening a jar of pickles than Michelle Williams did when being tortured by Evanora. James Franco seemed slightly stoned throughout the entire movie, often just smiling and giggling at everything that passed, not to mention his character Oz was pretty much a tool throughout the entire movie and his womanizing manners only severed to slander the good name of the Wizard of Oz that we all know and love. The only actress that I can give any good review to is Mila Kunis for her performance as Theodora. She did quite well as a heartbroken witch.The only thing saving this movie is the graphics. Don't get me wrong, it's enjoyable when you're picking fun at it, but if you're going for a movie that recaptures everything audiences loved about the wizard of Oz you'll be highly disappointed.

Frank Baum, is all about magic and hope. Oscar Diggs (James Franco) is a not so ethic magician who entertains a small circus in a black-and-white dusty Kansas when hes hurled away by a whirlwind and thrown into a colored Land of Oz. (Because until then the film was in black-and- white).When he gets there, he first meets one of the three witches, Theodora (Mila Kunis), which is also the first person to remember that the prophecy said that the new Oz is going to fall from the sky (like Oscar just did). So she starts to believe she just found the new Oz like the prophecy has announced and falls in love for him. But Oz seems to fall in love for every beautiful girl he meets, then Theodora begins to fell very very sad...and this sadness will have its cost for Oz and for all the people from this magic land.Then Oscar Diggs, now Oz, must enter into an epic adventure, but he will find some good friends to help him: A broken doll named China Girl in a abandoned city, which is not strong, but will help him in many manners; a flying monkey named Frank, which Oz will save from a lion will some of his tricks; and Glinda, the good witch, the witch that Evanora made Oz think that is the bad one. Oz will learn that not everything that seems something really is what we think, so many people that seemed to be bad, show that they are not, like Glinda herself, and the opposite is also true, like Evanora, which is the real bad witch. In this epic journey, Oz will need to believe in himself and be the ""Oz"" that this enchanted land real needs, even if hes not a real mage like Glinda or Theodora. Hes not a real mage...but he has his tricks as a magician, and he will show them up to save the world.Starring Rachel Weiz(as Evanora), Michelle Williams(as Glinda) and Bill Cobbs (as Master Tinker), Oz: The Great and Powerful is all about magic and belief.Now Oz must believe that he can be ""The Wizard"" the prophecy is all about, but not only that. He must believe that he can also be a better man.",Oz the Great and Powerful

My review should be seen through this prism.The film started with great aplomb. The initial scenes (shot in black and white) were engaging; despite the gray-scale, plenty of colour was caught in the can. The comedic escapades of Oz were a joy. Beyond the hilarity, the tristful exchanges with Annie (Glinda) were the most touching in the entire film.My level of enjoyment was downhill thereon. The next hour passed with much fanfare, but little imagination. The development of the witch characters had too light a touch, and the final siege sequences offered little drama.

Baum wrote in 1901.Actually, Sam Raimi (the director) focuses the story on the Wizard itself and his trajectory towards the fantastic city of Oz. It's possible, although, recognize that Sam Raimi revisited 1939's movie in terms of aesthetics. The change of colors from sepia to colorful, the fact that Theodora becomes green after her sister's spell and the yellow brick road are examples of references taken from the previous movie which are not in the novel by Baum.Trying to escape of his enemies in a hot air balloon, Oscar Diggs (James Franco) faces a terrible cyclone and ended up in this magic land called Oz. Surprised by the fact he's still alive, he gets to know Theodora ( Mila Kunis) , one of the three witches (Evanora, is played by Rachel Weisz and Glinda is played by Michelle Williams) he is going to get in touch with. Who are the good and bad people of this lovely land? Is Oscar Diggs the Wizard that everybody waits for? Will he be able to become Great and Powerful amidst his epic adventures?'Oz: the Great and Powerful' is worth watching because of Franco's impeccable performance.

It was as though the background was flat and the characters had been cut out and stuck in the front. The whole movie looked so fake that there was no way to become engaged in it. The emerald castle (which should have been the most spectacular vision of the entire movie) looked like a drawing.The plot was lacking. I hate to use the word boring, as I have to deal with children who use that word all the time, but this movie was just plain boring. I struggled to sit through the lack of interaction in the plot. The characters had no buildup that would cause you to care at all what happened to them. It reminded me of stories we had to write in grade school.The choice of cast added nothing to the movie. I swear if I ever see Oz smile again I will scream, as that seemed to be half of what his character was directed to do. The good witch did nothing to entice you to like her character. She was just there saying the lines. Theodora the witch threw tantrums like a child. None of the cast was able to draw you into their characters, making you love or hate them. I just wanted them to be gone.",Oz the Great and Powerful

The colors of the enchanted kingdom are amazing and so pleasing to the eye. the special effects are creative and exciting. always nice seeing a movie that has a happy ending and leaves you smiling when you walk out of the theater. great all age groups can stay riveted and enjoy the movie so much . won't be disappointed when you take the kids or grandkids to this one!",Oz the Great and Powerful

It may be okay for adults, but this movie is ABSOLUTELY NOT APPROPRIATE FOR CHILDREN and therefore is NOT FAMILY ENTERTAINMENT.James Franco gives a good performance as a sleazy character who is ultimately considered to be ""good"" in the end because someone decides he has a ""good heart.""

502,Streetleft,Go see this,10,3 April 2013,Go see this movie while it is in cinemas. Great to watch in 3d on the big screen. This is a movie that will become a classic. I have seen it twice and I have never seen a movie at the cinemas twice before. I don't like long movies normally this one goes for over two hours. But it is so nice to watch that you won't believe how quickly that time passes. From the start I was taken in by the film. Things aren't predictable. I was surprised how the storyline turned. So beautiful to watch. I think that this is a movie that is better on the big screen I don't think is would be as visually spectacular on aggressive but the story is great. The 3d in the film is well done and it is an enhancement to the movie. Some times is can distract from the story but that doesn't happen here. Go see it.,Oz the Great and Powerful
503,johnrayyrocks,Oz goes to Oz,10,5 April 2013,"This was an awesome movie. I actually don't understand why people would not love it. Weak Sauce if you hated it...The acting was not over acted. James Franco was great. I think people either love Sam Raimi or they hate him. There is no in between. I loved his Spider Man adaptations and I loved this movie. I also love that I saw Bruce Campbell. I do agree with those who say it is visually stunning. I actually think I may have liked the visual effects in this film more than Avatar. Great family film. I don't think there was one drop of blood spilled in this movie, which is another reason I liked it. In a day in which Hollywood seems to want to spill as much blood as possible, it was nice to see a fairly non-violent movie. There is some scenes with witches that may be frightening for a young child, but I for one thought the innocence of this movie was refreshing. In some ways I would compare this movie to How to Train Your Dragon. A surprisingly good story line without a lot of complications and spectacular visuals. And some very sweet characters.",Oz the Great and Powerful
504,kissingcats000,Let me down,4,5 April 2013,"I am not really one for long, complex movie reviews, so I will jump straight to the point with this one. I really wish I had better words to say about it. I went in with high expectations but sad to say I was disappointed as I left. The movie takes way too long to get started. The beginning was well put together, including the introduction of the music boxes which will later become part of the plot, but I found myself checking my time and waiting for the real plot to start. Point blank, it took way longer than it should have. It was a drag. When it finally does start up, we immediately get jumped into the problem with blatant scrip that dulled the realism. (I expect realistic script from every movie, fantasy or not.) It seriously lacked suspense. Maybe this is just my high expectations letting me down and I am the one at fault, who knows. The special effects were fantastic, I would give 5 stars on that. I have nothing to criticise on that part. The ending was disappointing. I expected some kind of plot twist or something exciting to happen, but it never did. The movie took too long to begin, and then ended as soon as it started. If you're one for cliché, fantasy-like, happily ever after type movies, this is the one for you. I would skip over it if I were someone like me who went in expecting a modern plot twist on an old fantasy theme. (haha, those are hard to find nowadays.) Overall I'd give it 4/10, and most of those stars coming from the special effects.",Oz the Great and Powerful
505,richard-the-computer-wiz,"Hard-core fan of the original, amazed that I like the prequel",8,13 April 2013,"Having been convinced for much of my (lengthy) life that the original Wizard of Oz was the greatest movie ever made, I was skeptical that I could ever like a sequel, prequel or remake of it (Great and Powerful is actually a prequel). To say I was pleasantly surprised would be an understatement - amazed is more like it. This movie manages to blend many elements of the original with many new and original elements which have great merit on their own, achieving the hardest of all balancing acts by creating an original work that feels fresh and new despite being based on an existing one. It successfully reiterates the fundamental underlying theme of the original, that we already have that which we seek within us if we only could recognize it, and throws in a refreshing blend of new elements along with a superb modernized rendition of the colorful and magical land of Oz. It's not flawless with the occasional moment that seems to fall flat and a cast that is just a notch short of being top-tier. But this is a superb movie well worth seeing for died- in-the-wool fans of the original as well as those with little or no knowledge of it.",Oz the Great and Powerful
506,bturley26,Stunning and adorable,10,29 April 2013,"I went into this expecting it to be a total loss like the recent Alice in Wonderland, and I was so wrong. One of my biggest complaints about Alice in Wonderland was the lack of wonder and charm in Wonderland. This movie was packed with wonder, everything I would have ever dreamed Oz to be and more! Because the effects were so awesome I expected the story to suffer but the story was great, perhaps predictable but so, so fun. One thing rare to most movies today but definitely apparent in the first Wizard of Oz movie, is genuine charm. Genuine charm is hardly ever recognized and appreciated this day in age because it is unfairly categorized as campy or cheesy. But this movie took what might otherwise be campy charm and turned it into sear delightful humor. The characters were remarkably innocent. Even the so called ""sleezy"" wizard, with his gigantic smile, went from cheesy to adorable. Between the faces of sweet children, and the humanity within the china doll and monkey, I say this movie gets ten stars for visual effects and for being true to the innocence of the first movie through the the many adorable characters. Keep in mind the scary witches and monkeys will likely frighten small children. Loved it!!!",Oz the Great and Powerful
507,rainbowdashgen4,Gut-Wrenchingly Awful,1,11 May 2013,"I don't know if it's just me or not, but this movie was TERRIBLE. The writing is bad, the acting is awkward, the story is clunky, and what really kills it is the pacing. One second we're in the early 1900's and the next we're in Emerald City. And where is all the stuff we know and love? Yes, I know that Disney didn't have the rights to much of it, but if you're making a prequel, THEN GET THE F****** RIGHTS. What if MGM decided to make a big-budget Batman movie? They couldn't even call him Batman!But the worst part BY FAR is when the Wizard (James Franco) is trying to defeat Theodora (Mila Kunis) in Emerald City. Really? They build a f****** HOLO PROJECTOR and smuggle in hundreds of pounds of fireworks, create a shrinking indestructible carriage, and scare the witch off with FIREWORKS. G******* FIREWORKS.The only ""redeeming"" factors are the visuals. For instance, when the cocky a**hole Wizard enters Oz it's like the reveal of Requiem in Halo 4, breathtaking and beautiful. But even then I wanted to storm out of the theater. I mean, after the movie ended I was literally screaming at people who liked it.Honestly, save your money and pass up this stupid flick. Read a book, or hell, play BioShock Infinite. Just don't watch this movie. It's so bad it tops my Worst list, that's right, it's worse than C.H.U.D. and Birdemic!",Oz the Great and Powerful
508,shahmeershahid,The Wizard Of Flawz,3,27 May 2013,"I had great expectations from this film because i became a big fan of James Franco after his acting in ""The Pineapple Express"" but sadly that is the only type of acting he can do. From the minute the film began i could sense the 'fakeness' in his acting which really irritated me throughout the film and which forced me to use the forward button more often than usual. The story also lacked that special ingredient/twist which keeps the audience attached. The length of the film was also a main factor. Coming to the other aspects of the film - the visual effects were not also that great. To be honest i liked the opening credits more than the visual effects in the film. I gave it a 3/10 only because i liked the opening credits and the hot air balloon.",Oz the Great and Powerful
509,JimHBus,Well cast but special effects are the winning factor,6,27 May 2013,"Franco is the perfect actor for the main character Oz. He is exactly like an extrovert friend of mine.

I found myself referring to Franco by my friend's name during the viewing.This is a charming story for small children ... and there are still many children out there who will love this film despite the vast number of blow-them-up films for children.As an older viewer, I found the imagination expressed through the use of CGI special effects to be worth the price of admission.

Really nice cast as well ! This is definitely on my 'favorites' list now. Especially really enjoyed the magical music from Danny Elfman. You really feel Luke you're in a magical place. I want to own this one on DVD and add it to my collection. Once again a masterpiece of Disney. I didn't expect otherwise, to on the other hand, I really didn't know what to expect at all.

511,anthotira,"Entertaining, but might not be memorable in the long run...",6,19 June 2013,"I found it entertaining. Maybe I'd watch it again another time or two sometime down the road. As sh!tty and trollish as many IMDb critics tend to be, I saw a number of them say Rachel Weisz﻿ pretty much made the movie, and that's pretty spot on. Her brilliant performance was kind of the glue that held the whole thing together...because, quite frankly, I didn't really feel that neither James Franco or Mila Kunis fully held up their end of the bargain. All around, the cinematography was great, though, and made up for whatever shortcomings I, personally, happened to think I saw in the acting of Franco and Kunis. CGI-wise, the monkey was pretty hilarious and awesome and the little china girl was adorable. Overall, the effects seemed really cool and not like....""Oh, this movie is all about CGI...""...it was more of this beautiful moving art thing in keeping with the wonder and magic and fantasy of Oz and Disney and all that good stuff.Can't think of anyone else in the movie I didn't really like or at least believe enough to remain engaged in what all was going on at any given point(s); the fact that Franco and Kunis had such prominent, prominent roles in the thing is what made it stand out to me so much. I think some years ago when Franco was a younger man, his acting seemed inspired and beyond his years, but I dunno..it seems like as the years progressed, he hasn't, really. He's kind of just the same guy, no matter what role you drop him into.....not in a good way.....in the way that guys like Seth Rogan and like...Snoop Dogg...lol...are the same person, acting the same way, in this movie that you saw in the last movie or 2 or 3 you saw them in....almost as if the story or character or anything of the sort doesn't even matter...instead of really stepping up and making the role (and the whole craft of acting and suspension of disbelief) their b!tch. It kind of, instead.....comes off highschool/college play-ish from Franco...and I thought the overall brilliant feel and look and directorial touch of the movie deserved far better than that.I never would've ever thought I'd be sitting here saying Mila Kunis, for the most part, fell short as one of the main villains of the movie (not to mention to the girl who goes on to be the infamous Wicked Witch) after what we saw in Black Swan of her in a relatively predominantly antagonist role, but man, it just wasn't there, for whatever reason. At least not until like...the very end...she shoots a certain look that had me like ""Oh sh!t...there it is....that's the person who should've been there the whole time and the movie's almost over!"" lol. Plus I know Rachel Weisz had to kind of fight to get the part, and she was, far and away, the best and most inspired performance of the film, but it was kind of weird that her and Kunis are sisters even though Mila's got an American accent and Weisz is using her native English/British accent. Was there a reason for that confusion? lol...But yeah, it also ticked me off that people don't understand what a f*cking prequel is and were all irate about ""OH WHERE'S THE LION?????THE TIN MAN????? THE SCARECROW????""...the lion actually does make a bit of a cameo around the beginning...but it's a prequel....all that sh!t happens way later....we don't know how any of that stuff got there yet....this is all happening way, way before Dorothy or any of that sh!t. Another critique is that the pacing at the beginning is a little too fast as well. Everything just kind of goes by quickly and he's swept in a random ass twister and there he is in the magical, colorful world of Oz and there's Mila Kunis and she's already head over heels in love with Franco and.....f*ck.....way to cut a big chunk of subtlety out of your sh!t, for f*ck's sake. lolBut hey, it's a fun ride, though. It won't change your life. In one watch, I don't know that I noticed any sort underlying ""lessons"" or pearls of wisdom, as were a-plentiful in the children-targeted pictures of old. I doubt this movie will affect or leave any kind of lasting impression or be in any way as timeless a tale as the Wizard of Oz was to the childhood of...well....most of us alive today. But it's worth a watch...if only because Rachel Weisz is a boss b!tch, the monkey's pretty funny, and the little china doll girl will give you a case of the ""feels"" almost any time she speaks. lol. And Michele Williams is kind of a dark horse in this one. She has a fairly key part and pulls it off wonderfully, but is far overshadowed by what Weisz brought to the dance.I was struggling between a 6 and 7 rating, so I'll go with a 6.85 if I must.",Oz the Great and Powerful

I do hope that if they intend on doing a remake of ""The wizard of Oz"" that they create a better plot. Great selection of actresses and actors.

But one day i decided to watch it, and i'm glad i did! It was very enjoyable, great for children and adults, the casting was great! directing was great, i just think it's an all in all great movie.Now let's talk about the cast: PERFECT! James Franco: James is a great actor! he can take on many different roles, compare his role from ""Spring Breakers"" to this and you'll see what i mean. I know there has been some chaos about James being cast, and yes Robert Downey Jr and Johnny Depp could've been Oz. But i feel like James did a fine job! he was funny, charismatic and just all around great as the character!Mila Kunis: OK, some people really seem to think she's been miscast, but honestly. This is the witch way before the witch in the original movie, if you get what i mean. The witch in this movie is fresh, doesn't know all the kinks. she's still a girl, in the original the witch has matured and in this one Kunis is portraying a younger fragile witch. She has strong delivery and she is captivating on screen, i felt myself just waiting for her to come back on the screen. She was committed and gave it her all, and she was fantastic! My favorite character! Rachel Weisz: Brilliant! She really nailed it on the evil, sassy witch, she was amazing! strong dialogue, even though one little hiccup about the movie was dialogue. Rachel i think got the good straw because her dialogue was so feisty and great.Michelle Williams: I mean i hadn't really heard of her before seeing this, but i mean her role didn't seem to have much affect on me. Shes a beautiful woman and a great actress, but sometimes being good isn't that interesting. But i liked to see her kick butt at the end.The monkey & china doll were also great contributions to the movie.All in all, it's greatly acted, beautiful scenery, it's a nice and fun family movie.

Second a plot not easily discernible.in this film there a couple of twists. I did actually quite enjoyed myself with this film. Unfortunately being that it follows such a well renowned movie,there are going to be many expectations.putting aside your expectations whether it be wanting to see some of the old characters such as a Judy Garland look alike or a cowardly lion and take the movie up on its own merits and you can enjoy yourself. It has great acting and a nice little plot. In short it's a cute film, many innuendos and some soul searching.so watch it and enjoy it and let it stand on its own you'll have fun.

515,keep-it-secret-aliases-g,The Good and The Bad,4,15 July 2013,"**SPOILERS** (They are minor, but I still have to declare it)The beginning was a great. I especially liked the back story of Theodora (Wicked Witch of the West) and Evanora (the Wicked Witch of the East) because no one ever talked about her. China Girl and Finley were lovable and hilarious with their different attitudes towards the journey. The ending of this story, however, was its down fall. The writers could have written anything for the ending of the prequel to the Wizard of Oz, and they chose to write Theodora's heart being not only broken by the Wizard but wished away, and having the Wizard only spare her a regretful look at the end when she turned down his offer. The Wizard took advantage of Theodora's lack of experience with men, made her love him and encouraged her only to make her feel so heartbroken that wished her heart way and turned wicked. He never apologized and he never tried to make amends except for telling her that if she turns back she'll be welcomed. It was made clear from the beginning that Glinda got whatever she wanted because she was pretty,and that was the downfall of hundreds of movies where the underdog girl won over her prettier one. And to have Oz and Glida kiss after all that happened to Theodora was sickening. It made it look like the Wizard never gave a damn about Theodora and that actually made me cry, because he didn't that he destroyed an amazing girl who wanted nothing but peace and was just as kind as Glinda. To me this story sent out the most disturbing message, ""It's fine with you mess with the heart and life of a good girl who wanted nothing but for you to be the best as long as there is another woman who is prettier that wants the same thing because, hey, the first one turned into a green mess, and it's all my fault but who cares as long as I got the pretty one.""

I think for me it wasn't so bad since I already toyed with the idea that the film wouldn't be to my liking. Then again I still wasted money on the film...So whats wrong with the film?Well let's begin with the fact that most of the acting is frankly off. Especially Mila Kunis does a very poor job on her role. Also the super surprising 'plot twist' is really obvious a few minutes into the film, which wouldn't be so bad if the audience wouldn't anticipate the moment ...(SPOILER ALERT! from here on) she would transform into the evil witch of the west. At first I actually thought the voice acting, which can be gruesome in Germany sometimes, was the reason that it was that bad, but after re-watching the film in English, the German version was even a bit better (which is extremely rare).Then there is the thing I really didn't like about the film. It had so much potential. The basic story could have been much better, but instead of giving the characters more time to develop, to breath, they had to give you a white water ride in a balloon for about 5 minutes, after already showing the dangerous situation in the midst of a tornado.The only thing that was really good about the film was the visuals themselves, although if the heart behind them is missing it really doesn't work. Also some of the supporting cast was quite good.",Oz the Great and Powerful
517,jrandle11,It sucked. Save your money.,4,17 July 2013,"It just plain sucked.First, the setting was beautiful but was lacking somehow. Maybe because it wasn't very original.Next, the scene when we meet Theodora is awkward, for want of a better word. TBH, Mila Kunis, although stunning, was disappointing and not fit for the role.Theodora, as a character, made me scream. She falls for Oz in seconds and then is all ""I'm your Queen"" then goes all crazy when he doesn't feel the same. Yes, she is innocent, but her naive nature made me rake my fingernails down my face.Oz is a big ol' dick. Also it's -- in a way -- his fault that Theodora turned crazy.There was no twists in the plot. Everything was very straight forward, predictable and at times I actually thought too much into it, predicting twists that weren't even there.Glinda annoyed me as a character. Maybe it was her extreme nice-ness, i don't know.Overall, I knew this movie wasn't going to be amazing but I really didn't think I would be this frustrated by it.",Oz the Great and Powerful

People under 50 years old probably can't appreciate how important a movie the original was for several generations of both young and old. It was THE movie we waited anxiously to see for an entire year. It was the most exciting, engaging, terrifying movie of all. So my expectations for a prequel were off the charts but I was beyond delighted by this movie. In my opinion, the casting is perfect and the performances impressive. The visuals are stunning, the score spot-on. The most impressive of all is the incredible script that creates a spectacular story of its own while amazingly explaining the origin and rationale of all the OZ characters in the original.

The only good thing about it was Rachel Weisz - best actress in the entire thing! Everything else was terrible, disappointing and not worth the time spent to watch it! I was angry for days later, feeling that they took such a great story and stepped all over it!

520,jaclynyounger,Glittering Story with a Few Flaws,8,2 February 2014,"First off I would like to say that Oz was overall a pretty great movie. The actors were very well matched and the special effects were dazzling. The duality between Kansas and Oz was a part a really enjoyed, each character from the beginning of the film showed up later on in the story, in one form or the other (the two most clever were Oscar's assistant becoming a monkey and the crippled girl becoming the fragile China doll). However, I was really upset with the quickly declining love story between Oscar and Theadora. I absolutely adore Mila Kunis in this movie (and most other movies) and I think that her character could have at least received some sort of justification. I fell like Oscar never truly learns his lesson about toying with women, as soon as he sees how nasty and bitter Theadora has become he literally moves on to the next witch in his path. I'm really upset that he didn't even try to apologize for being so double sided, I felt that Theadora was really cheated and screwed over big time in the end. To me, it appears as if the character of the wizard is still extremely shallow.",Oz the Great and Powerful
521,jesszaytcheva,overall thoughts include...,5,29 March 2014,"Honestly, I was expecting more from this film. The trailer looked so cool and compelling but the movie as a whole turned out to be a let down. If you are into cheesy endings and cliché plots then this movie is for you. Mila Kunis was not a good choice for the wicked witch, her acting was not that on point, rather almost awkward. The best performance was given by Joey King who played the China Girl which is sad but true. King's character had theatricality, passion, and emotion. As for the effects.. they were poor. You could tell everything was shot behind a green screen and CGI'd in, and although brightly colored they were a little ""behind"" for our modern day technology. Finally, the editing was choppy and awkward. Between the fade ins and sudden scene changes, the viewer doesn't really know what ends and what begins. Overall score I give is 5/10 because the story line was somewhat cute and it can watched as a family flick on a Saturday night (if you have nothing else to do).",Oz the Great and Powerful

That being said, there is one matter that has been bothering me and that is the identity of an extra toward the end. Once the bad guys are done away with, the crowd erupts into cheering and there is a semi-closeup of an African-American woman who jumps up and hugs a guy standing next to her.

Seriously, why does Disney think it has the right to re-write everything?: Glinda does NOT meet the wizard before he becomes 'the' wizard, she meets him MUCH later when he is already the wonderful wizard of Oz. And for goodness sake she does NOT fall in love with him she banishes him from Oz! And WHY did they turn Theodora green??? AND THEN called her the wicked witch of the west??? Oh right, to recall the wicked witch from the original film so we feel there's SOME relation to our adored classic well THATS JUST COMPLETELY WRONG!! Elphaba (the ACTUAL wicked witch of the west) IS NOT EVEN IN THIS MOVIE!! why? well, because she is probably a baby then, and SO IS Glinda too since they are the same age! But wait, Gilinda is in the movie! Why?? BECAUSE THEY HAD THE TIMELINE COMPLETELY WRONG!! If you are going to put Glinda in together with the young wizard, then Elphaba should be the wicked witch in the same time-line, and not another character turned green with a broom! GOD! Just make up another character and leave Glinda out of it! Also Elphaba is the one who makes the monkeys with wings, technically they are associated with her, so again, WHY DISTORT EVERYTHING???

524,anna-07692,Wonderful family movie,9,25 August 2015,"I watched this with my daughters who are 5 and 10, and my husband last night and we all thoroughly enjoyed it. The story line is great and kept us gripped right to the end.The characters and their background stories are all well thought through, especially Oz and the witches. Characters such as the flying monkey and the china doll are great additions that make the whole story more magical. I thought it was all very well acted. The chap that plays Oz is brilliant - great facial expressions : ) The witches were both brilliant, as were Nook and the Tinker.The scenes and CGI are everything you would expect from the land of Oz; brightly coloured and beautifully imaginative. Lots of gasps of delight from the girls! It does have a couple of scary bits that make you jump - they would probably frighten younger children, but we all loved it!The script was well written and really quite funny all the way through. All in all, It was funny and beautiful and left you feeling warm and fuzzy. A Great, colourful, feel good family movie!",Oz the Great and Powerful
525,phoebemiller,Alright,6,16 November 2015,"While watching the movie you can generally feel that Raimi has invested a serious effort to represent ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" as something between a children's fairy tales, a dark fantasy for adults and a decent prequel for ""The Wizard of Oz"". With a heavy heart I must say that his plan failed. Although the scenes are full of many details and some of the characters are very well designed and implemented using effects, not in a single moment of the film do we have the Illusion that the actors actually are in this magical environment, rather than in front of a green screen.The strongest performance as could be expected, comes from Rachel Weisz. This experienced actress gives the poorly written script and her one-dimensional character so many layers, only with her talent. A modest, but over-needed contribution comes from Michelle Williams.",Oz the Great and Powerful
526,laurariffo,yo i thought this movie was a fever dream,4,30 March 2019,Don't remember it that well but i just assumed it was all my imagination,Oz the Great and Powerful
527,ccortez-2,Visually stunning,10,6 March 2013,"I absolutely LOVED this film! I was captivated from the very beginning, yes, with the credits. The 3D was excellent. I had to look away once because I actually experienced the emotions of the physical action. Keep in mind that I did not attend this screening with the thoughts of comparing it by any means to the original. The casting was excellent and I was drawn to the characters. I enjoyed the story. It's the first early screening I attended where the entire audience applauded when the film finished. Maybe it was the 3D, but you will not be disappointed. I'm going to see it again. It's a must for me and I rarely see a movie twice at a theater. I believe this film lives up to its title.",Oz the Great and Powerful
