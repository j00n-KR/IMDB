0,MartinHafer,Quite enjoyable but so was the original...,8,12 January 2013,"When it comes to films, I almost always hate remakes. Too many times, they are unnecessary and not nearly as good as the original. So, in the case of ""High Society"", it was a tall order to get me to like the film. Fortunately, instead of a direct copy, they made this version a musical--making it a bit different.The film begins on a very good note with a clever introduction by Louis Armstrong. Only when you think of the original classic opening in ""The Philadelphia Story"" do you realize it isn't quite up to the original in this instance. As for the rest of the film, it's charming and fun--and the songs are remarkably good. Because of this, I was shocked when I found I was having a good time watching it--I really wanted to dislike it! My only serious complaint was Grace Kelly's character--she seemed much less likable and nasty than in the original. Still, with Frank Sinatra and Bing Crosby laying out tunes, you can't help but have a good time.",High Society
1,TheLittleSongbird,Enjoyable musical remake of a classic,8,19 December 2010,"I suppose comparisons between The Philadelphia Story and this film are inevitable. The Philadelphia Story is the superior film, but High Society, its musical remake is still very enjoyable without being a classic. The choreography is a mixed bag, it is wonderful in places but pedestrian in others(apparently Bing Crosby couldn't dance and sadly here it kind of showed), while I was a little disappointed at how underused jazz great Louis Armstrong was here. However the production values particularly in the cinematography and costumes are gorgeous and the songs and score are superb. Well, Did You Evah, the witty and infectious duet between Crosby and Frank Sinatra especially is a joy to behold. The story is charming and the screenplay has its fair share of delights, while Charles Walters cleverly under-directs. The acting and singing was what I loved most. Celeste Holm is wonderfully snappy, while Crosby and Sinatra are believable together and sing beautifully. Special mention should also go to Grace Kelly who plays the part of the beautiful spoiled rich girl superbly. Overall, no masterpiece but an enjoyable and very worthy musical elevated by the music and performances. 8/10 Bethany Cox",High Society
2,bkoganbing,"What a swelegant, elegant movie this is",10,6 June 2005,"MGM was pretty lucky to secure the talents of Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, Grace Kelly, Celeste Holm, and Louis Armstrong to get involved in this great musical adaption of The Philadelphia Story.Cole Porter contributed a great original score for this film with songs very specifically written to suit the talents of High Society's players. I do wish Celeste Holm had been given more to do than just the duet with Frank Sinatra, Who Wants To Be a Millionaire. On Broadway Celeste Holm was a musical star with Oklahoma and Bloomer Girl to her credit, but MGM didn't want to recognize that.For this film, the story is reset from Philadelphia to Newport, Rhode Island to bring in the famous Jazz Festival. Philip Barry's social commentary is toned down and a very partisan Greek Chorus is added in the person of Mr. Louis ""Satchmo"" Armstrong. Satchmo tells you right up front who he's pulling for to win Grace Kelly and he helps musically along the way.Satch and Bing have that classic Now You Has Jazz duet, so successful was it that they did an album together a few years later. Bing Crosby during his life was crazy about jazz musicians and there was no one he liked better than Louis Armstrong. No one on the planet could resist that man's joy for living.Grace Kelly got a chance to bat 1000 in the recording industry. She was no singer as she would have freely admitted, but Cole Porter wrote True Love specifically to accommodate her limited range and when she does the last two bars of True Love with Der Bingle she got a million selling record for her one and only platter. As for Bing he got his 20th Gold record and the only one not with Decca records. True Love was nominated for Best Song at the Oscars but lost to Doris Day's Que Sera Sera which boomed all over the charts in 1956. It was sadly Cole Porter's last opportunity to win an Oscar for one of his movie songs.Frank Sinatra got a couple of good ballads in You're Sensational and Mind If I Make Love to You, but what he's best remembered for is that classic Well Did You Evah duet with Bing. Today's fans can't possibly appreciate the screen meeting of the two best and best known singers for the previous generations. A musical summit conference.High Society's tone is a lot lighter than the Philadelphia Story. The cast in terms of acting ability are not in the same league as Grant, Stewart, Hepburn, and Hussey. But folks it is a musical. I doubt those stars could have carried off the Cole Porter score.You can't miss with a cast like this, in either film for that matter.",High Society
3,SnoopyStyle,all the fire power in the world,6,25 December 2016,"C. K. Dexter-Haven (Bing Crosby) invites a band (Louis Armstrong and His Band) to his Newport estate to practice. His neighbor and former love Tracy Lord (Grace Kelly) is getting married to the respectable George Kittredge. She disapproves and broke up with Dexter over his lowly music career. Tabloid Spy Magazine uses scandalous information about her father to blackmail the family to gain access to the wedding. They send Mike Connor (Frank Sinatra) and photographer Liz Imbrie. Tracy decides to fake out the tabloid by switching uncle Willy and her father.The cast is high-powered. Based on The Philadelphia Story, a musical remake is not absolutely necessary. It doesn't have quite the same amount of screwball fun. Grace Kelly may not have the comedic chops to deliver fully on the role. She gives off an air of someone trying to be quirky. Part of it is that her character is a little fake but it does translate into Kelly faking it. She's too high maintenance to be appealing. Crosby and Sinatra have the easy charms. I'm not a big fan of the Cole Porter songs. This has all the fire power in the world but it is not quite as fun.",High Society
4,Hitchcoc,I Will Watch the Movie to Hear the Songs,7,5 December 2016,"Correct, it is not ""Philadelphia Story."" No Hepburn. No Grant. But it does have the beautiful Grace Kelly and Bing Crosby at his peak. It is a silly movie with non-stop interactions between characters, people still carrying torches after divorce, and some beautiful Cole Porter songs. One of the most gorgeous songs ever written is ""True Love"" done as a duet with Crosby and Kelly. She actually sings and the song is just plain pretty, with one of the most touching messages of any song ever written. Of course, everything goes haywire for a while, all the participants running into each other. And in the end it gets worked out.",High Society
5,mark.waltz,How High You Get in Society,8,19 October 2013,"The same year that MGM musicalized ""The Women"" with ""The Oppposite Sex"" (and destructed it), they also musicalized the film version of another one of their earlier hits, ""The Philadelphia Story"". Rather than toss in mediocre songs and unnecessary plot developments, they let talent take over, bringing in Cole Porter to write the songs and one of the best choices of casting ever for a remake.""The Philadelphia Story"" is the tale of society brat Tracy Lord, one of the richest women in America, who as a divorcée is now about to re-marry. Katharine Hepburn played that part both on stage and in the film, revitalizing her career, and intuned the character with both feminine and feminist qualities that made the character extremely interesting. Grace Kelly may not have that ability, but she does have the elegance, and in 1956 was all over the news as she herself was about to marry the Prince of Monaco. For one of her last films, she brought her classy demeanor onto the screen, and makes this a new Tracy, not one of a Hepburn nature, but one equally independent and interesting, now with songs.Her ex-husband is Bing Crosby, co-star from ""The Country Girl"", and she can't get over him no matter how much she insists she has. He named his boat ""True Love"" after their signature song, and when she flashes back to him singing it with her, it is obvious that she is still very much in love with him. They might as well have sung ""Kiss Me Kate's"" ""So in Love"" because of the connection formerly married couples often have, children or not, and like Mary Haines in ""The Women"" said, ""Pride is something a woman in love can't afford."" As her family prepares for the wedding (the story seems to have moved to Bel Air, as they live on the very same estate Jerry Lewis did in ""Cinderfella"" and later the Clampetts of ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" would), two reporters arrive in the guise of Frank Sinatra and Celeste Holm. Noticing all of the pretentious wedding gifts while waiting for the bride-to-be, the two break into ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"", and this duet is one of the greatest in MGM history. Witty Cole Porter lyrics and a fascinating melody prove that a story doesn't need to be original, just done with taste and humor.With Sinatra and Crosby together in the same picture, you know that the two former heartthrobs of that old thing called radio are going to have a duet, and they do, with ""Well Did You Evah!"", basically a commentary on the ridiculousness of both society and the gossip press. ""You must be one of the newer fellas"", Crosby quips when Sinatra imitates Bing's style, while Sinatra sings ""Don't dig that kind of croonin', chum!"" with a bit of an intoxicated delivery.The jazzy Louis Armstrong is there for two songs, opening the film with ""High Society Calypso"" and singing a duet with Bing much like he had done 20 years ago in ""Pennies From Heaven"". A fine supporting cast rounds out the film, but for me the stand-out is Celeste Holm who only the year earlier had sung about another Sinatra romantic issue involving ""The Tender Trap"". Director George Sidney takes on a very witty screenplay, mixes in the wonderful songs, and ends up with a confection that is both lavish and simple at the same time. An unnecessary Broadway version took the ""less is more"" feeling of the movie and blew it up to be a pretentious bore. Sometimes, its just best to leave well enough alone, although I'm glad that MGM didn't with this.",High Society
6,gavin6942,"Bland 1950s Musical, a Disappointment",5,26 June 2012,"Childhood friends Tracy Lord (Grace Kelly) and C.K. Dexter Haven (Bing Crosby) got married and quickly divorced. Now Tracy is about to marry again, this time to a shrewd social-climbing businessman.Bing Crosby and Grace Kelly may have worked their magic in ""The Country Girl"", but lightning did not strike twice with this one. Even adding in Frank Sinatra and Louis Armstrong (as himself) could not save it. Talent abounds, but the overall plot was convoluted and the songs were nothing special (even if they very loosely inspired a popular game show).I was mostly just bored throughout this film and only finished it because I strongly dislike quitting partway through. But there was nothing overly redeeming here for me. A woman attracted to multiple men? There is potential there, but it never really plays out as the love triangle it could have been. It was just too happy to really be memorable.",High Society
7,lee_eisenberg,Louis Armstrong thinks to himself: what a wonderful world...right?,5,11 May 2006,"In the half-century since ""High Society"" came out, big musicals have obviously ebbed from the cinematic forefront. This one is passable only if you accept it as totally outlandish. If, like me, you watch it just as a reminder of how hot Grace Kelly was, then I guess that everything balances out. She plays bored Newport heiress Tracy Lord, about to get married yet again. When her ex (Bing Crosby) shows up, that throws a wrench in the works, as does the presence of two magazine reporters (Frank Sinatra and Celeste Holm). Tracy is now going to have to decide once and for all what she plans to do.As a musical, the whole movie does seem kinda hokey. Fortunately, there's Louis Armstrong and his band to keep things going. Nowadays, of course, shortening Tracy's middle name Samantha to ""Sam"" is reminiscent of ""Bewitched"". And knowing what a creep Bing Crosby was in real life sort of weakens the movie. Frank Sinatra is another person of whom I have a very low opinion.All in all, this movie is very much a product of old-style Hollywood. I can just imagine a modern version...probably starring Jackie Chan and/or Jim Carrey (I'm implying that it would be really neat). But like I said, Louis Armstrong provides lots of great music throughout the movie, and Grace Kelly may have reached her most beautiful/dazzling/gorgeous/etc here. Only she could play a role like this.",High Society
8,jboothmillard,High Society,8,1 February 2010,"I recognised the title instantly, and even if it wasn't featured in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, I would have still been glad to watch it, from director Charles Walters (Easter Parade). Basically rich and spoilt Tracy Samantha Lord (Grace Kelly, in her last big film before retirement) in Newport, Rhode Island has one day to go until she is to be married to good standing but very dull George Kittredge (John Lund), and her ex-husband C.K. Dexter-Haven (Bing Crosby) moves back into his mansion next door. Another pair of uninvited guests show up, reporter Mike Connor (Frank Sinatra) and photographer Liz Imbrie (Celeste Holm) from Spy Magazine who want to cover the wedding, and they have embarrassing information about Tracy's father Seth (Sidney Blackmer). As a private means of revenge, Tracy makes them believe that her Uncle Willie (Louis Calhern) is her father, and vice versa. As this is going on there is a tiny moment where Tracy wonders if she was right to divorce Dexter, but then she ends up hanging with Mike a lot, and they have a little love thing go on. So it comes to the wedding day, she has to choose to go with the original plan and marry George, go with her newfound feelings for Mike, or go back to her past and get back together with Dexter. Also starring Margalo Gillmore as Mrs. Seth Lord, Lydia Reed as Caroline Lord and Louis Armstrong and His Band. Crosby, Sinatra and Kelly are all cast perfectly for their roles, the songs ""Little One"", ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"", ""Well, Did You Evah"" and ""You're Sensational"" stand out, it is just a good charming classic of a musical romantic comedy, some see it as remake of The Philadelphia Story, but it is an enjoyable musical romantic comedy. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Song for ""True Love"" and Best Music for Johnny Green and Saul Chaplin. Grace Kelly was number 86 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and she was number 15 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Women, the film was number 60 on The Ultimate Film, and it was number 34 on The 100 Greatest Musicals.

9,moonspinner55,Flat-across-the-screen MGM musical via play and movie,5,9 September 2007,"Plush MGM musical remake of ""The Philadelphia Story"" (with a switch in locale to Newport, Rhode island) looks great but falls flat--and is miscast to boot! Grace Kelly stars as a society beauty and divorcée who is planning to remarry but gets mixed up again with ex-husband and neighbor Bing Crosby, who is in the middle of organizing a jazz festival (!). Meanwhile, tabloid reporter Frank Sinatra and photographer Celeste Holm arrive to cover the impending nuptials--and to get the scoop on Kelly's misbehaving father. A by-the-numbers fantasy-version of romantic interplay, one requiring principals who match up well and sparkle with chemistry. Unfortunately, Crosby and Kelly are more like brother and sister, while journalist Sinatra gives an aw shucks-styled, loner performance (his eventual love-match with Holm is yet another mistake). The good-natured Cole Porter songs are jovial, but director Charles Walters seems afraid to deviate from the story's stage origins, presenting this whole thing as if it were a play. The action is so encumbered, one spends much of the running time admiring the sets; elsewhere, the starchy wisecracks have been preconceived to tickle theater audiences in need of a guffaw and a yawn. Two Oscar nominations, both in the music department: Porter for Best Original Song, ""True Love"", and Johnny Green and Saul Chaplin for Best Scoring of a Musical.",High Society
10,tavm,"Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, Grace Kelly, and Louis Armstrong provide plenty of enjoyment in the musical High Society",8,13 May 2013,"So for this Mother's Day, Mom wanted to watch this movie that we ordered on Netflix disc a few days ago. What a wonderful surprise this was for both of us! Cole Porter really outdid himself this time providing all the songs that are sung by such legendary singers like Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra (their ""Well, Did You Evah"" is sublime) as well as Louis ""Sachmo"" Armstrong and then there's Grace Kelly, just before becoming Princess Grace of Monaco, doing pretty good accompanying Der Bingle in her warbling with him on ""True Love"". Also Celeste Holm also sings with The Voice on ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire"" to enjoyable effect. This was a remake of The Philadelphia Story but since I haven't seen that one yet, I enjoyed this version good enough. So on that note, High Society is highly recommended. P.S. Once again, I love pointing out whenever someone from my current home state of Louisiana is in the cast and of course, Mr. Armstrong came from New Orleans, which is a two-hour drive from where I live!",High Society
11,edwagreen,High Society is High Brow ***,8,12 April 2010,"What makes this musical special is that it's a remake of the 1940 hit film ""The Philadelphia Story.""Grace Kelly is captivating as Tracy Lord, the part made famous by Katharine Hepburn. Bing Crosby is phenomenal as her former husband, and the cast is rounded out by Frank Sinatra and Celeste Holm, as reporters assigned to cover her marriage to John Lund.Holm looks like she is really aging here, and is too old to be the love interest of Sinatra.The songs are marvelously staged, include my favorite True Love. Nominated for best song of 1956, it's amazing that it lost. With Bing Crosby singing it along with Miss Kelly, it sure had the earmarks of a Cole Porter winner. Nonetheless, the song category of the Academy Awards has always produced upsets. For Thee I Know from ""Friendly Persuasion was supposed to win that year but was upset by Que Sera, Sera from ""The Man that Knew too Much."" (Seems as though Doris Day singing a nominated song was the kiss of gold Oscar.)The story of ""High Society"" reveals itself at the pre-engagement party when Kelly and Sinatra get plastered and really let their hair down. The picture falters somewhat as it appeared that Tracy would marry the Sinatra character.Louis Armstrong provides plenty of entertainment as he plays himself at the wedding. Sidney Blackmer and Louis Calhern are extraneous characters here and are even forced to change identities before Blackmer lets out the truth.An entertaining musical showcasing great talent but beholden to the upper echelons of society.",High Society
12,wes-connors,Low Returns,4,3 May 2013,"In this musical re-make of ""The Philadelphia Story"" (1940), multi-millionaire songwriter Bing Crosby (as C.K.

Arriving to cover the ""High Society"" wedding is Spy magazine reporter Frank Sinatra (as Mike Connor). Mr. Sinatra also falls in love with Ms. Kelly. With her fiancé John Lund (as George Kittredge) and Mr. Crosby, Kelly is torn between three loves. And, Sinatra doesn't seem to notice that photographer Celeste Holm (as Liz Imbrie) is his perfect love match...At times, Kelly imitates the inimitable Katharine Hepburn. In real life, Kelly married a prince and retired from movie-making. She is the weakest link in this near dud, making it a less than fond farewell. Any other of her lead performances is better. Kelly's legendary singing co-stars rely on the old stand-by that often works for legendary performers - just show up. At least, Crosby and Sinatra walk around the big, expensive and elongated ""Vista-Vision"" sets without getting lost...Kelly did get to sing on Crosby's million-selling ""True Love""; the flip side was another popular duet, Crosby and Sinatra's ""Well, Did You Evah?"" All songs were written by Cole Porter, the unsung hero in this production. His soundtrack took it to the bank.

13,hitchcockthelegend,I'm such an unholy mess of a girl.,7,17 November 2012,"High Society is directed by Charles Walters and adapted to screenplay by John Patrick from the story written by Philip Barry. It stars Bing Crosby, Grace Kelly, Frank Sinatra, Celeste Holm, John Lund, Louis Calhern, Sidney Blackmer and Louis Armstrong. Out of MGM it's a VistaVison/Technicolor production with music is by Cole Porter and cinematography by Paul Vogel. Plot finds Kelly as socialite Tracy Samantha Lord, who finds herself courted by three gentlemen. One is her ex-husband, jazz musician C.K. Dexter (Crosby), one is Spy Magazine journalist Mike Connor (Sinatra) and the other is the man she is set to marry, well to do George Kittredge (Lund). It is a musical reworking of the play The Philadelphia Story, itself already filmed as a screwball comedy in 1940.Glossy and frothy on the outside, but very little underneath, High Society is testament to entertainment rung out by star power and high production values. In truth, the cast and Cole Porter tunes are reason enough to get lost in the pizazz of it all, but its shallow centres stop it from reaching the higher echelons of big studio musicals. Crosby and Sinatra are blatantly way too old for Grace Kelly, who was soon to be Princes of Monaco, the comedy aspects of the story are lost in the mix and characterisations are flimsy at best. But when you have things like ""Well, Did You Evah"", Satchmo and Grace's beauty driving your movie forward, a smile on the face come the end is pretty much guaranteed. 6.5/10",High Society
14,jotix100,The Newport story,7,14 June 2006,"Something wrong happened as MGM tried to update the much more original ""The Philadelphia Story"". Some of the blame should go to the uninspired direction of Walter Charles, who can't overcome what the great George Cukor achieved in the original movie version. Part of the blame is shared with John Patrick's screen play that might have been based on the Philip Barry play, but what one sees on the screen is a dull attempt of movie making. Donald Ogden Stewart, who adapted the original play gave that film a light and fun touch, which in Mr. Cukor's hands and brilliant direction came alive throughout the picture.It's not fair to make comparisons, but unfortunately, the creators of ""High Society"" leave themselves wide open for it. Right off the start, these stars can't compare with the magnificent performances by Katherine Hepburn, Cary Grant, James Stewart, Ruth Hussey and the irresistible Virginia Weidler.Grace Kelly was an elegant actress who as Tracy Lord gives the role another interpretation but doesn't capture the spirit of the no-nonsense socialite she is supposed to be. Bing Crosby, as Dexter, has some good moments, especially in the ""True Love"" segment in the yacht with Tracy. Frank Sinatra's Mike Connors is all right, although we can't just imagine how he can be in love with Liz Imbrie. Celeste Holm who appears as Liz gave a tamed reading of her character.The best thing in the film is the prologue and the finale with the incomparable Louis Armstrong, whose presence would have been used to put some sparkle in this subdued version of Philip Barry's wonderful play.",High Society
15,preppy-3,Breezy fun,8,5 January 2006,"Musical remake of ""The Philadelphia Story"". Grace Kelly is going to marry handsome but dull John Lund. Her first husband (Bing Crosby) is still in love with her and wants her back. Frank Sinatra and Celeste Holm join in as reporters covering the wedding. Naturally everything goes wrong.This was Grace Kelly's last film before she left Hollywood to get married and become a princess. Fortunately her last film is lots of fun. It's nowhere near as deep as ""Philadelphia Story"", but who cares? This is a musical--you're supposed to enjoy yourself. Also the first teaming of Frank Sinatra and Bing Crosby. It moves quickly, is beautifully shot in color and has the entire cast in top form.Kelly is beautiful (and very good too), Crosby and Sinatra are both laid-back and easy-going, Lund has little to do and Holm is just along for the ride (but enjoying herself).

16,CinemaSerf,Cracking songs do almost all of the work...and do it well.,7,21 December 2020,"This reversioning of the splendid ""Philadelphia Story"" is a film with two sides. A fine cast list with Grace Kelly, Frank Sinatra and Bing Crosby deliver their parts stylishly enough, but in a somewhat theatrical fashion. To be honest, I found their characters a bit too square - especially the spoiled rotten Kelly (""Samantha""), who finds herself 48 hours from her second attempt at a wedding whilst ex husband Crosby (""C.K. Dexter-Haven"") living next door and out to maximse the mischief. Sadly, for me anyway, there is a distinct lack of chemistry between the three stars. Celeste Holm (""Liz"") and her journalist pal Sinatra fare a bit better on that front, and Louis Calhern stands out as the rather wily ""Uncle Willie"". There is humour to be found, but mostly it's pretty limited and only Crosby really seems to have anything like a glint in his eye. The music, however - is a completely different thing. Some of Cole Porter's finest lyrics - ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire"" the superb Crosby/Sinatra duet ""Well, Did you Evah"" and the surprisingly effective ballad ""True Love"" from Crosby and Kelly all make for a score that is wonderfully topped off by some cracking Louis Armstrong and these forgive much of the dramatic sterility of the acting. It's a sumptuous adaptation of Philip Barry's play that takes a swipe at the profligate and shallow lifestyles of the wealthy Côte D'Azur set, with settings and costumes to match - and is certainly at the top end of the genre; just a shame the stars didn't quite all join in!",High Society
17,writers_reign,Now You Has STYLE,10,14 July 2005,"This movie comes THAT close to being the Perfect Musical Film - and nothing comes closer. The ingredients were all there - a brittle, social satire penned by socialite and sophisticate Philip Barry and tailored expressly for the talents of Katie Hepburn who, in the late thirties had been branded 'box-office poison' by mid-west film distributors and responded by commissioning Barry to provide a vehicle for her return to Broadway; wait sixteen years then turn the story over to another sophisticate who just happens to be the Best songwriter in the business, Cole Porter, throw in the best male singer of the twentieth century, Frank Sinatra and you can really stop there but just for a laugh throw in ANOTHER top singer, Bing Crosby, a great jazz combo fronted by Louis Armstrong and sterling support in the shape of Celeste Holm, Louis Calhern, Sydney Blackmer, Margalo Gillmore and John Lund. Okay, you're stuck with a clothes-horse who trained at the Forestry Commission School of Acting as a Leading Lady but you can't have everything. When he began work on this score Cole Porter had already written and seen produced what would turn out to be his last Broadway score, Silk Stockings, and there would be only one more film, Les Girls and one TV 'special' Aladdin to come but he excelled himself with the 10 songs he composed for this film (technically, nine inasmuch as Well, Did You Evah, had been written 17 years previously for the Broadway show DuBarry Was A Lady and the 'extra' lyrics were the work of Saul Chaplin and not Porter himself but that's to quibble). If the classiest number by a mile is the last one, Mind If I Make Love To You, a typical Porter ballad in beguine tempo, there's not too much wrong with Sinatra's other solo, You're Sensational, the Sinatra-Holm duet Who Wants To Be A Millionaire, the Crosby solos Little One and I Love You, Samantha, the other duets, Now You Has Jazz and Well, Did You Evah or in fact ANY of the songs. Apart from switching the location from Philadelphia to Newport, Rhode Island, to accommodate the musicalization John Patrick was remarkably faithful to Barry's original (maybe it was the Sinatra element; he had previously starred in a musical version of Four Daughters - Young At Heart - taking the role that introduced John Garfield to the screen and again the musical version was remarkably faithful to the original)and if, like me, you have both versions on one tape and play them one after the other you'll find a remarkable amount of dialogue remains intact. John Lund had started out as a leading man and in Billy Wilder's great black comedy A Foreign Affair he'd had Marlene Dietrich and Jean Arthur competing for his attention yet here he plays stuffed shirt George Kittridge to perfection. With the possible exception of Grace-mahogany-Kelly there isn't a less than exquisite performance in the entire film. Truly a classic.",High Society
18,Boba_Fett1138,Quite good for its time.,7,26 August 2010,"Considering the fact that in 1956 the musical genre was pretty much dead already, this movie is still a rather good and enjoyable one, that takes you back to the good old days of the genre, that combines musical aspects with comedy and romance.It's not one of those musicals with big dancing numbers or one that features singing throughout but more one that features sweet little songs from time to time and every now and then Louis Armstrong and his band pop up as well to play some songs. It serves no purpose at all really once you start thinking about it but it's interesting to look at it as an early bit of commercializing of Hollywood. Louise Armstrong did this quite a big actually, since I had seen him appearing in movies like this before.Even though I wasn't too fond of the story, it still suited the movie well, as weird as that might sound. It provided the movie with plenty of good moments as well as some fun ones. Still the actual main-plot line was quite annoying and not really one that makes a good example in my opinion. I just don't like movies at all that handle a serious thing such as love and marriage as something so trivial and sends out that massage that you could and also should marry just to any random person, for the sake of it. It perhaps just wasn't handle that well in this movie, since the story can't be really blamed for it, since it's one that still worked out well for the 1940 Oscar winning movie ""The Philadelphia Story"". And yes, that particular movie did win an Oscar for its screenplay.This movie only got nominated for its songs and music, which seemed right. It has some pretty good songs, that are now being regarded as classics. You'll surely recognize some of the songs once you hear them.People talk a lot about this movie its cast and mostly seem to talk about how everybody got miscast in it. I don't agree. I had no problem with Grace Kelly, even though I wasn't always too fond of her character and her actions, which seemed strange at times, to say the very least. Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra simply did their thing and they did it well. I especially liked Frank Sinatra, who's acting for a chance was actually quite good.A good and fun movie that is a great throwback to the golden days of the musical-romantic-comedies, with some of the stars of those days in it as well.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",High Society
19,oscaralbert,"After seeing Grace Kelly prance around as a character named ""Traci Lord"" . . .",7,3 February 2018,". . . during this live-action fleshing out of the Disney Princess dream romance meme, HIGH SOCIETY spawned a herd of young actresses vying with each other to become the next True Life Fairy Tale Royal Lady. Though this gaggle of Traci Lords failed to produce another Grace Kelly Rags-to-Royalty story during the 1900s, and though HIGH SOCIETY cannot hold a candle to the PHILADELPHIA STORY upon which it's based, and though Cole Porter seems way off his game here with such rhymes as ""Circe"" and ""mercy,"" and though Bing Crosby crooning jazz duets with Satchmo is almost as jarring as a Andy Griffiths-Gomer Pyle-Louis Armstrong bebop trio would be, and though Ms. Kelly flight to Monaco would be explained if she saw Katherine Hepburn creating her role for the first time AFTER the premier of HIGH SOCIETY, this flick MIGHT be a better movie than FINIAN'S RAINBOW. Perhaps Prince Rainier memorized ""George's"" line to Ms. Kelly to lure her across the Atlantic: ""There's a beautiful purity about you, like a statue--I want to put you up on a pedestal where you belong; where I can adore and worship you."" Though Frank Sinatra sings to her that ""I don't care if you're called Miss Frigidaire,"" and her movie dad compares her to a bronze sculpture, HIGH SOCIETY's plot drips with the potential for at least a four-way, and Ms. Kelly accurately predicts the particulars of her Real Life demise on the roadways of Monaco during her wild drive to the cemetery with Old Blue Eyes.",High Society

The eve of her marriage to a new fiancé coincides with a Jazz festival and the arrival of journalists Liz and Mike (Celeste Holm and Frank Sinatra). And what do you think happens?This musical remake of The Philadelphia Story is no more than a slight romantic comedy of manners and, as such, is moderately pleasing but unexceptional.Where it succeeds, however, is in its wonderful batch of Cole Porter songs, every one of them a winner, and every one delivered perfectly by one of the most accomplished Hollywood musical casts ever assembled. The staging isn't always brilliant - rubbish back projection for True Love for a start - but the songs themselves, and the vocal performances of those delivering them, rise above everything else. And it was good to see the amiable fusion of Crosby's old-school crooning and Sinatra's (then) more current jazzier phrasings, although Crosby never was able to dance in the manner of anything other than an over-sized and rather gauche elf.High Society scores highly on the basis of the soundtrack alone.",High Society

She's engaged to John Lund, but her ex-husband Bing Crosby tries to win her back—and to top it all off, reporter Frank Sinatra falls in love with her while writing about her upcoming wedding! The only reason to watch this movie—unless you actually liked the original—is to watch Bing and Frankie sing and act together.

24,SimonJack,"A light, fluffy, star-studded part musical",6,26 August 2021,"""High Society"" is a very light comedy musical and romance that showcases three great musical talents of the mid-20th century in America. The best reason to see this film is for the few songs by Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra, and some fine jazz by Louis Armstrong with his band.However, there are a couple other aspects worth noting, for which some may want to see this picture. This was Grace Kelly's last film and it was released three months after the 26-year-old Oscar-winning leading lady had married Prince Rainier of Monaco in April 1956. Many among modern audiences well into the 21st century may not even know who Grace Kelly was. But she was well known at that time, and her leaving Hollywood to become royalty in Europe was an extra draw back then.However, Kelly's role here is nothing to showcase her talents. She has one small segment of comedy that's good. But, her Tracy Lord is mostly a snooty divorcee who whines and complains about her ex-husband whenever he's around. That's Bing Crosby's C. K. Dexter-Haven. He's a highly successful song writer who lives among the super rich that inhabit these lush palaces along the Newport coastline. The cast includes some other prominent supporting players and former leading actors in John Lund, Louis Calhern, Celeste Holm, Sidney Blackmer and others. MGM packed a good assortment of known actors into this film, and the star-studded attraction made it the ninth highest grossing film in the U. S. that year - yet nothing on the level of the biggest films.The plot is very thin and somewhat hokey. Sinatra and Holm are a news team from ""Spy"" magazine sent to cover the wedding of Tracy Lord to John Lund's George Kittredge. It's a very flimsy plot and screenplay, with very little acting by the cast. As for romance, Tracy Lord appears so frigid it's hard to imagine her even warming up to her intended. No, the only enjoyment this film provides is in the music, including the Oscar-nominated original song of Cole Porter, ""True Love."" Some sources say this is a remake of ""The Philadelphia Story"" of 1940. It seems to have borrowed the idea for the romantic triangle divorce and wedding, and a setting of the very wealthy, but very little else in the plot, setting, cast makeup, or screenplay resembles that film.One other interesting bit is the film's opening with the aerial scenes of the coastal mansions along the Bellevue Avenue peninsula of Newport, Rhode Island. These were the homes and summer homes of some of the wealthiest American families in the 19th and early 20th centuries. One can still see many of these mansions from their oceanfront views along the Cliff Walk that is open to the public. Some of the former homes of the wealthy have been turned into museums. Newport's scenic location and layout make it a nice place to visit on vacation. It's home to the International Tennis Hall of Fame and museum, and one can take boat tours and enjoy various pursuits and recreation on and around the water.Most modern audiences probably wouldn't enjoy this slow, fluffy film. Fans of the music of the past and die hard movie buffs would be able to enjoy it. Here are the best lines from the film.Liz Imbrie (Celeste Holm ), ""Mike, I don't like this assignment."" Mike Connor (Sinatra), ""Neither do I, Liz, but I like to eat.""Lord's Butler (Richard Garrick), ""The family will be here directly to welcome you.""

25,JamesHitchcock,The Fair Miss Frigidaire meets the Old Groaner,7,12 November 2008,"Like ""The Philadelphia Story"", of which it is a remake, ""High Society"" is a ""comedy of remarriage"", a genre popular in the thirties and forties, but perhaps rather less so in the fifties. Films about divorced couples rediscovering their love for one another after flirtations with other partners were a way of seeming sophisticated and daring without actually transgressing the Production Code.The main character in both films is the wealthy Philadelphia socialite Tracy Samantha Lord, who has three men competing for her affections- her ex-husband Dexter Haven, whom she divorced after a brief marriage, her new fiancée George Kittredge and Mike Connor, a journalist sent to cover her impending marriage to George but who also finds himself falling in love with her. (Rather confusingly, Tracy is occasionally- especially by Dexter- referred to by her middle name. Perhaps Cole Porter needed a three-syllable name to fit the music for the song that was to become ""I Love You, Samantha"").I have never enjoyed this film as much as ""The Philadelphia Story"", but Porter and his music are not to blame for that. The songs are often tender and lyrical (particularly ""True Love"") or witty (particularly ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"" or ""Well, Did you Evah!"") The producers of the TV game show ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"" should perhaps have remembered that, in the song, the answer to that question is an emphatic ""I don't!"" Jazz fans will enjoy the film for the sight of Louis Armstrong playing himself; he and his band are supposed to have been hired to provide the music at Tracy's wedding.The main reason why the film is less enjoyable than its predecessor lies mainly in the casting. As in ""The Philadelphia Story"", Tracy is played by one of the iconic screen beauties of the period, Katherine Hepburn in the earlier film, Grace Kelly here. Kelly was, if anything, even more beautiful than Hepburn, and rarely, if ever, looked lovelier than she does here in, her last film appearance before her marriage to Prince Rainier. She is not, however, as convincing as Hepburn was as Tracy, who is supposed to be a cold, icy beauty (""the fair Miss Frigidaire"") who gradually becomes warmer and more human. Hepburn could play a Frigidaire to perfection, but Kelly is a bit too warm and melting even in the earlier scenes. Kelly does surprisingly little singing for the leading lady in a musical; her only number is a duet with Bing Crosby in ""True Love"". I felt that if Tracy had been given more songs these might have helped to emphasise the development in her character. (And if Grace Kelly's voice wasn't strong enough another singer's voice could always have been dubbed over, as was often done in screen musicals of the fifties).In ""The Philadelphia Story"" we know from the beginning that Tracy and Dexter will end up remarrying, but we only do so intellectually from our knowledge of the conventions of the genre; emotionally, we feel that James Stewart's Mike might just be in with a chance. In ""High Society"" we know both intellectually and emotionally how the story will end, which rather spoils the suspense; it is quite clear from the beginning that Tracy, however much she may deny it, is still in love with Dexter. George, a pompous stuffed shirt, isn't in with a chance, and as for Mike it is obvious, right from the moment we hear them singing ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"" together, that he is meant for his attractive lady photographer Liz (Celeste Holm doing her sexy older woman thing).Of the male characters Frank Sinatra as Mike is the best, although even he loses out in comparison with Stewart's Oscar-winning performance. Sinatra- very different from Stewart in terms of acting style- plays Mike in a more cynical, wisecracking manner. As for Crosby as Dexter, he has nothing like the style or charisma of Cary Grant. Crosby (despite his nickname of ""the old groaner"") had a pleasant enough voice, but his style of singing was always too relaxed and emotionally bland for my taste. (I have to admit, however, that this style occasionally served him well, as in his duet ""Well, Did you Evah!"" with Sinatra). His style of acting was generally equally nonchalant. I recently commented that George Clooney's character in ""Ocean's Twelve"" was so laid back he was horizontal. Crosby's Dexter (like some of his other characters) has passed the horizontal stage; he's so laid back his feet are actually higher than his head.As a musical, ""High Society"" is actually a pretty good one, musically speaking. As a romantic comedy, however, it is not in the same class as its illustrious predecessor. 7/10",High Society
26,lasttimeisaw,"just surrender to it, the quintessential Golden Hollywood nostalgia and pizazz",8,22 October 2017,"A musical treatment of Philip Barry's warhorse play THE PHILADELPHIA STORY, HIGH SOCIETY is ingenuously ensorcelling in its aural and ocular extravaganza and conceivably modest in the sharp- tongued sparring, because when you have two top-drawer crooners at your disposal, plus a showstopper Mr. Louis Armstrong and his band as the icing on the cake, no one would blame director Charles Walters for veering into a different lane from George Cukor's acerbic gender politics, not least because it is Princess of Monaco, Grace Kelly's celluloid swan song, a germane valediction where her glamour and pulchritude would be forever engraved in its apotheosis. The story is a cheesy romp in its vein, on the eve of the wedding between socialite Tracy Samantha Lord (Kelly) and a lower-class but upstanding gentleman George Kittredge (a dead-serious Lund), Tracy's ex-husband C.K. Dexter Haven (Crosby), a jazz musician, feels compelled to woo her back because he still loves her deeply. And the advert of reporter Mike Connor (Sinatra) and photographer Liz Imbrie (Holm) from a tabloid magazine, who are assigned to cover the wedding in exchange of keeping a disgraceful skeleton in their family's closet, arranged by Tracy's uncle Willie (a tricksy Calhern in his curtain call), further muddies the waters while Tracy is deviled by the reminiscence of the happy days (in a yacht called ""True Love"") in her first marriage and a ""made of bronze"" reproach from her two-timing father (Blackmer), which is a flea in one's ear. Whereas she is self-aware of her ""putting-on-a-pedestal"" standing - ""I want to be loved, not be worshiped"", but facing an embarrassment of riches, can she choose the right husband from the one her heart swoons, the one her mind dictates or the one her soul enchants? Her final say is a safe bet, but here, arguably at her most relaxed and animated, Grace Kelly aptly channels a more ethereal iteration of Katharine Hepburn's Tracy with sheer candor and allure. But ineluctably, a supreme frisson of elation and wonderment is amply purveyed by the music artistes, a smorgasbord of Porter's pop standards and Armstrong's jazzing skiffle, highlighted by a jingle novelty WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE? between Sinatra and a phenomenal Holm, a tipsy Crosby-Sinatra duet WELL, DID YOU EVAH! and a central piece where Crosby introducing Armstrong and co. in the NOW YOU HAS JAZZ improvisation.

On the other hand, she's sensational as Frank Sinatra reminds us in one of the scores many memorable songs. And she's absolutely lovely and who couldn't be smitten by her.In the Cary Grant role of C K Dexter-Haven, Bing Crosby is blander, (he acts as if he's on holiday), but he does get to sing 'Now You Has Jazz' and duets with Sinatra on the magnificent 'Well, Did You Evah' so you are inclined to forgive him anything. As the reporters, Sinatra and Celeste Holm are quite the equal of James Stewart and Ruth Hussey, (and they get the great 'Who Wants To Be a Millionaire' number), and if the whole thing is rather like a large meringue with much the same consistency, it's still pretty irresistible.

29,secondtake,"Even without Philadelphia Story to put it to shame, this is too much artifice, not enough wit",6,15 December 2015,"High Society (1956)You can see this movie as one of the last of the great silver screen musicals —and running out of originality and verve. Or you can enjoy Cole Porter brought down to a middle class sensibility (never mind the wealth of the characters here). Or you can just marvel at some great footage of Louis Armstrong, and at the inclusion a black jazz band as a centerpiece in a big budget movie.So there are reasons to give this movie a try, even though it is fairly slow going, and a pale shadow of the original, the truly great 1940 ""Philadelphia Story."" Grace Kelly plays the leading woman about to be married, and she lacks the cool stony quality that Hitchcock wisely taps and instead tries to be a lively, witty, physically lithe leading lady. Just like Katherine Hepburn? Yes, except she's no Katherine Hepburn, and it all feels a bit striving.Likewise for Bing Crosby, who plays a laid back guy who happens to have a jazz band (and who does a good swinging song with Louis and crew alongside). He isn't quite screen magic—that is, he's no Cary Grant. Frank Sinatra is fine, but he has a smaller role. Alas.And so it goes. Brightly lit, with big flashy Technicolor set design, the mood throughout is upbeat and fun and funny. And so it's not a bad thing to view.

30,vincentlynch-moonoi,Highly overrated by people swept up with the mystique of Grace Kelly,6,7 November 2014,"I'm one of those who don't admire this film much.On the positive side, it's a lush production. It has a Cole Porter score -- my favorite composer -- although I'm impressed with only a few of the songs: ""True Love"" (of course), ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"" (with a swellegant turn by Celeste Holm), and the bright ""Well, Did You Evah!"" (in a terrific duet by Bing and Frank); the other songs are forgettable.Another positive note are a number of the supporting actors -- Celeste Holm as a reporter, Louis Calhern as an uncle, Sidney Blackmer as the father, Margalo Gillmore as the mother, and young Lydia Reed as the younger sister.Unfortunately, I can't say as much for the lead cast. Bing Crosby is always very natural on screen, and is here. Grace Kelly has another turn as a spoiled brat, and as far as I'm concerned flubs the role terribly. Frank Sinatra plays the smart ass that he seemed to be in real life...which may have gone over well in the 1950s, but isn't as attractive today; and ironically, he played a poor drunk (type casting from the Rat Pack days?). John Lund as the fiancée????? Stick with the original ""The Philadelphia Story"", or watch this one as a comparison. Frankly, about the only reason this film was made was Bing's whim and Grace Kelly's rising star (in terms of the latter, thankfully it was the last film with her that we had to suffer through).",High Society
31,atlasmb,Amazing Grace,8,4 May 2013,"Let's look at this recipe for making a good film:1. Get Louis Armstrong and his band to play the part of a (jazzy) Greek chorus. Check.2. Get Cole Porter to write the music. Check.3. Get some quality actors, including Grace Kelly, Frank Sinatra, Celeste Holm. Check.4. Get a story about a beautiful woman trying to choose between three desirable men. Check.5. For the three charming, desirable men, get Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby, and George Lund. (cue sound of screeching brakes!)It stretches believability when Grace Kelly is interested in the Crosby or Lund characters, especially when her character is written as a woman with her own mind. When she makes her final choice, it provides as much excitement as a dull whack to the head. Although I question the casting of all three men, I think the film could have worked if just the Crosby role was recast.My other criticism of this film is the staging, which feels so often like a stage play.Nevertheless, Grace is perfection in form, dressed in some wonderful fashions. Seeing her in her last film makes one wonder what other roles she might have taken on if she were not drawn to a principality. Maybe Hitchcock would have pointed his loving lens at her again.Not to belabor the point, but Bing Crosby's ""toddy for the body"" style of humor is about as hep as a forties crooner and feels really lame when played against Sinatra's casual demeanor or Armstrong's cool cat persona.Edited 4/29/15: Upon rewatching, I am increasing my rating to ""8"".

32,funkyfry,"great tunes, mediocre show",6,5 September 2007,"""High Society"" is a pretty enjoyable movie even though I don't think it really pulls off everything it tries to accomplish. If you told me there's a movie that has the same basic characters and situations from the hilarious ""Philadelphia Story"" set to music by the incomparable Cole Porter and featuring the talents of people like Frank Sinatra, Celeste Holm and Louis Armstrong, I would expect a more memorable film than this one. Now, that's not to say that I was constantly comparing the film to the original because that would be unfair, and frankly I've only seen it once quite a few years ago. I feel that even taken on its own terms though the film is disappointing, though not really horrible. The only really exceptional part of the film is anything with music, particularly the too-brief scenes with Louis Armstrong (who plays himself; the film seems to be designed to associate itself with the hip Newport Jazz Festival).So, IMHO Porter's music is the star of the show, especially the classic patter-style duet between Bing Crosby and Sinatra. I was surprised upon seeing the documentary on the DVD that ""True Love"" was the big hit of the show because for me it was the low point musically. But then you never can account for popular tastes. Anyway I found the chemistry between Crosby and Grace Kelly unconvincing. Crosby is supposed to seem laconic and relaxed but he just looks tired to me, as if he's not really putting in any effort. Sinatra on the other hand was a bit more fun and more believable in his role, and I greatly enjoyed seeing Celeste Holm in a tailor-made part for the great lady of Broadway. Unfortunately I detected no more traces of chemistry between Holm and Sinatra than the other pair. I guess I thought Holm would end up with Louis Calhern's amusing character.Probably the film's greatest weakness is Grace Kelly's flat performance. I've never liked her in any film except the few she did with Hitchcock. Watch her in ""The Swan"" for example if you want to see exactly the same annoying performance that she gave in this film. And yes, I'm aware that the character is supposed to be annoying, but she should be endearingly annoying. She managed to accomplish that in ""To Catch a Thief"", so I believe much of the blame for her performance lies with Charles Walters, who probably needed to make her feel less comfortable around the set. You can also see it in Crosby's weak performance  they both look more like they are on vacation than at work. I think in the absence of strong direction these actors reverted to their usual devices. In Kelly's case that's a very limited collection of facial expressions and so forth that quickly grow tiresome. It's the one area of the film I can't help but compare with the original because Hepburn was so much More exciting and unpredictable on screen and that was basically what made this arrogant character bearable. Kelly is perfectly believable as a high society brat; it's not a case of poor casting but rather failure to tap into the humanity and charm of the character.This unhinges the entire film IMHO because I just can't see why Crosby and Sinatra's characters find her so appealing. When the music stops, the film loses its luster. A big deal is made of creating situational comedy when Kelly claims Calhern is her father but then it's simply dismissed in the ""bachelor party"" scene without mining the situation fully for laughs. Her fiancé is made out to be a total jerk but we never get to see anyone get even with him, there's no payoff. A lot of things just feel obligatory and the entire story feels disjointed.It's possible I suppose to make a superior musical film within the framework of a poorly-handled story, for example ""Hit the Deck."" But despite Porter's great tunes and the presence of many musical stars, this one never took flight for me because we're stuck with a leading man who can't dance and a leading lady who can't sing OR dance. Consequently there are too many ballads and not enough hot tunes to balance it out no matter how hard the mighty Satchmo tries. If this film had featured better leads than Crosby and Kelly and better direction it could have been incredible instead of merely pleasant.",High Society
33,ackstasis,"""Oh, Sam, you're slipping. That used to terrify me, the withering glance of the goddess.""",6,4 February 2008,"'The Philadelphia Story (1940),' which starred Katharine Hepburn, James Stewart and Cary Grant, is one of cinema's most fondly-remembered screwball comedies. Based on Philip Barry's Broadway play of the same name, it was a phenomenal critical and box-office success upon release, and continues to be cherished to this day. Less than two decades later, somebody decided that the film was due for a colourful musical retelling, and the result isn't all that bad. Assembling an all-star cast that rivals that of its predecessor {Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, Louis Armstrong and Grace Kelly  in her final screen role}, director Charles Walters produced an enjoyable romantic comedy with some catchy musical numbers, courtesy of Cole Porter. The film, though not quite as successful as its predecessor, received an admirable two Oscar nominations for Best Original Song {""True Love""} and Best Scoring. It might also have received a nod for Best Writing, but, in an odd twist, the Academy accidentally nominated the Bowery Boys film 'High Society (1955)' instead. The screenwriters of that film graciously declined the honour, and nominations for either picture were officially withdrawn.Tracy Samantha Lord (Grace Kelly) has always been known for her feisty personality and upper-class morals, often described by her peers as a ""cold goddess."" After her first marriage to the playful, sarcastic C.K. Dexter-Haven (Bing Crosby) ended messily, she now plans a wed a new man, an uptight and rather uninteresting fellow named George Kittredge (John Lund). On the eve of her wedding, two reporters from ""Spy"" magazine, Mike Connor and Liz Imbrie (Frank Sinatra and Celeste Holm), arrive to cover the festive occasion. Meanwhile, Dexter also turns up at Tracy's mansion, perhaps hoping to scavenge a new relationship with his lost love. Despite the considerable age difference between Grace Kelly and the various men vying for her attention {Kelly was 26-years-old, and Sinatra and Crosby were 41 and 53, respectively}, the main players make the romance work quite well. Louis Armstrong, accompanied by his band, appears as himself, and plays little role in advancing the plot, but Armstrong gives the film, in his inimitable way, an enjoyable running commentary, in addition to performing a few appealing jazz numbers.The film's set decoration and costume design is magnificent, perfectly highlighting the incredible wealth of Tracy's family. The actors relish their extravagant surrounding, lending the film an undeniable class and elegance. Of course, being a remake, 'High Society' suffers from an unfortunate lack of originality, probably compounded by the fact that I only saw 'The Philadelphia Story' around four short months ago. The transition into a musical definitely adds a colourful new dimension, but, in most other regards, the film simply lacks that certain freshness to its story. In my review of George Cukor's 1940 film, I remarked that it was one of the only screwball comedies whose conclusion was not completely predictable; obviously, the story couldn't fool me a second time. 'High Society' is probably best remembered today as the final screen appearance of Grace Kelly, who discarded an already-legendary five-year career in movies to wed Prince Rainier III of Monaco, becoming Her Serene Highness The Princess of Monaco. In this case, it seems, even Bing Crosby couldn't change her mind.",High Society

With some of Cole Porter's finest songs this side of Kiss Me Kate delivered by two expert crooners at the top of their game and a snappy and witty story it's always been one of my favourite feel-good movies.Flighty aristocrat Grace Kelly is going to marry solid capitalist John Lund against everyone's advice and with her former aristocrat husband Bing Crosby in sniping attendance  and it's going to be publicised in Spy magazine for the edification of the working class  in fact the very people the film-makers were hoping to draw into the cinemas. The point was repeatedly made that class doesn't matter, even when at the end everyone had paired off along class lines  back then High Society had to remain just that. Chavvy but honourable reporter Frank Sinatra got his tonsils around some classics: You're Sensational, the supreme Mind If I Make Love To You, Who Wants To Be A Millionaire (with wise-cracking dame Celeste Holm) and Did You Evah (with Crosby, one of the older fellows). However Crosby took the top title with True Love in the film's only flashback scene  and truly yar it was too. Louis Armstrong supplied worldly wisdom in pithy interludes and more music  shame there wasn't room for an entire (unmimed) concert!The print TCM UK has shown every week for the last 10 years is a bit frayed but I suppose (or hope) there was a better one available for the DVD.

39,Spleen,I notice I'm not the only one who was bitterly disappointed,3,30 June 2001,"It's as if Charles Walters took ""The Philadelphia Story"", broke it up into little tiny bits, lost a third of them, then hastily tried put the remainder back together again when he saw George Cukor walking up the driveway.  The result is not just worse than the original, but improbably worse.  For instance, not one actor - not even among the bit players - is as good as his or her predecessor.  How likely is this to happen by chance?  Off the top of my head I can count twelve roles; the likelihood of them all being performed worse the second time round is about 1 in 4096.  -Yes, I'm aware of sampling bias; I know that the only reason I'm making the comparison in the first place is that the original performances were better than average, but adjust the figure to allow for this and it would still be impressive - besides, I'm sure that a scene by scene or plot point by plot point comparison would yield similar results.ESPECIALLY the latter.  If you've only seen ""The Philadelphia Story"" you simply won't be able to believe how idiotic the story has become as a result of the hundred or so nicks and scratches it has received after passing through the MGM mimeograph machine.  Take, for example, Charles Dexter Haven.  His marriage with Tracy hit the rocks because - and this is the central moral of BOTH films, not just the first - she was intolerant of human failings.  What was Charles's failing?  In the original, he was an alcoholic.  This is a genuine failing, and it makes both him and Tracy more sympathetic than they would otherwise be.  It means that Tracy had some reason to treat him badly, that he's bargaining from a position of weakness, that he has things to prove to himself as well as to other people, that in conquering his addiction he has achieved something, and that (this is a minor point) throughout the champagne-laced festivities he has an overwhelming reason to remain sober - he doesn't do so just because the plot requires it.  Well and good.  Now: what failing does Charles Dexter Haven have in the remake?  None!  (I mean, did you really think the studio would let Bing Crosby play an alcoholic?)  Tracy left him because he wrote popular songs.  Need I tell you what nonsense this makes of the story?Lazily edited and flatly shot in uninspired Technicolor, ""High Society"" has nothing going for it but some Cole Porter songs.  They're wonderful, but they're not enough. ...Are you thinking, perhaps, that I should just forget the original and think of the remake as a stand-alone work?  If I could I would.  I'm sure this goes for everyone here who has seen ""The Philadelphia Story"".  If ""High Society"" had any energy or life of its own we could easily forgive it its failings and judge it as an independent creation - but it doesn't, and we can't.",High Society
40,nycritic,"Average Remake of ""The Philadelphia Story""",6,9 September 2004,"Fifty years later, this movie still remains only notorious due to its musical aspects more than its often wooden acting and lines mouthed verbatim from an (uncredited) Philip Barry.When the original feature was made in 1940, it was a gamble to bring Katharine Hepburn's all but dead career back into the spotlight one last time -- if it failed she would stay in Broadway.The story is well-known: Barry had written a play, ""The Philadelphia Story,"" expressly for Hepburn and her part, that of the socialite Tracy Samantha Lord, reflected Hepburn's arrogant position against Hollywood at the time. It was fitting to make into a movie and see if the results would garner the desired effect, and it comes to no surprise that it did, with Hepburn revitalizing what has come to be believed as one of the greatest film careers of all time.Then MGM decided to do a musical version -- the only way to do so, since Hepburn own the rights to the play -- and retitled it ""High Society,"" removing Philip Barry from the credits but not his text. They got the best of the talent that was available in the 50s, cast them in the roles made instantly classic by the actors of the previous movie, and watered down priceless dialogue, not only with padding here and there, but with the completely uninvolved acting. Kelly, in her last film, walked off into Monaco with a career that was apt, but not remarkable -- more known for perfect diction and beauty than actual personification. Holm is better here, but not as good -- she would never equate the spark she had in ""All About Eve."" She also looks oddly aged, a good ten years older than her thirty-seven years. Crosby and Sinatra are good, but not memorable -- certainly not Grant and Stewart, both oozing chemistry with Hepburn and with each other. The other actors do their parts; however, not a single one warrant mention -- not the case of young Virginia Weidler who walked off with the movie playing a small part as Tracy's kid sister in the original version.This is -- though now seen as a classic, it's overrated -- what's been come to be seen as a poor man's version of a much wittier, sharper story.

42,lewiskendell,A charming little musical from the 50's starring the wonderful Grace Kelly.,7,2 December 2010,"""If my wonderful, beautiful, marvelous virtue is still intact, it's no thanks to me, I assure you.""High Society is an irreverent, star-studded, music infused lite-romance set amongst the idle rich of Newport, Rhode Island. Quite funny and rarely serious for long, High Society revolves around wealthy and gorgeous Samantha Lord (Grace Kelly), and the three men competing for her affection as her wedding day draws near. Bing Crosby stars as her ex-husband, John Lund as her current fiancé, and Frank Sinatra as a visiting reporter come to cover her wedding for a gossip rag. Most of the entertainment from the film comes from Sam bouncing around between the three men, as she goes from a frosty goddess to a warm, fun woman truly ready to marry. I'm sure her behavior in the movie seemed a bit risqué at the time, but it's all ultimately innocent in the end. And of course by the finale, (almost) everyone is happy. There are quite a few songs sprinkled throughout the movie, with Crosby, Sinatra, Kelly, and Celeste Holm all getting a chance to belt out a tune or two. Louis Armstrong serves as something of an on-screen narrator, and also plays occasionally with his band. The songs are pleasant, with more than one or two likely to have you humming along.  Grace Kelly fans will be quite pleased with this, as she rarely looked more stunningly beautiful and gets to show off both her comedic skills and singing talents. She's quite funny, here, and carries a large share of the comedic burden as the movie goes on. Her chemistry with all the other leads is solid, and she carries off Samantha's mini- transformation quite well. Basically, if you weren't a fan of hers before seeing this, I'd be pretty amazed if you weren't smitten with her by the time the credits roll. This was her last role before leaving Hollywood for Monaco, and she definitely went out on a high note (pun not intended).High Society is a charming, fun movie that should appeal to fans of classic films, musicals, or any of the cast. It's hard not to smile as you watch it, but why would you want to avoid it, anyway?",High Society

Frank Sinatra and Celeste Holm play reporters Mike Connor and Liz Imbrie, the characters that (Oscar winner) James Stewart and Ruth Hussey played in the original, while John Lund replaces John Howard as George Kittredge, Tracy's new fiancé. Louis Calhern plays Uncle Willie (Roland Young had previously) and Sidney Blackmer plays Tracy's father Seth (in lieu of John Halliday); Margalo Gillmore and Lydia Reed replace Mary Nash and Virginia Weidler, Tracy's mother and younger sister respectively. Louis Armstrong plays himself, a friend of Dexter's, whose band comes to play in a local contest (Henry Daniell was in the non-musical first film). Cole Porter's song ""True Love"" and the Johnny Green-Saul Chaplin Score were Oscar nominated.Wealthy Dexter (Crosby) is still in love with (and still lives in close proximity to) his ex-wife of two years Tracy (Kelly), and is hoping to disrupt her pending marriage to George (Lund), a duller self-made man who's put Tracy on a pedestal. Tracy's younger sister Caroline (Reed; Weidler's name was Dinah) still loves, and prefers Dexter, who invites his trumpet playing friend Satchmo to visit to play a song he'd written for her loud enough to be heard next door.Because of her father's dalliance (e.g. to keep the story from being published), Tracy must allow reporter Mike and photographer Liz (Sinatra and Holm) from ""Spy Magazine"" to cover her nuptials. Initially, she tries to pass her more acceptable Uncle Willie (Calhern) off as her father, but Willie's a womanizer too and he puts the moves on Liz, who's has eyes for her co-worker Mike. When Tracy's father (Blackmer) puts his daughter in her place, calling her intolerant and cold, she decides to let off steam by going for a drive with Mike and, later, getting drunk (with him) the night before her wedding.

46,hall895,The Philadelphia Story...The Musical?,6,2 April 2011,"The Philadelphia Story! In Rhode Island! With songs! Well, does that have you excited? Yeah, me neither. But in the 1950s Hollywood could and would make a musical out of just about anything so here we are. There was absolutely nothing about The Philadelphia Story which in any way suggested a musical remake made any sense at all. Some things are definitely left well enough alone. The title of this film had to be changed due to the non-Philadelphia location and also to the not so small issue of Katharine Hepburn owning the rights to the play. So if nothing else this film which really had no reason to exist would end up providing a perfectly appropriate title for a Grace Kelly biography many decades later, High Society.Now just because this movie has no reason for being does not mean it is totally without merit. But it certainly suffers in comparison to the first movie. It really is a pale imitation, meant to be spiced up with a bunch of songs but unfortunately many of those songs fall flat. Some of the musical numbers are show-stoppers alright but not in the positive sense. They stop the film's momentum dead in its tracks. With Kelly, Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra this film certainly doesn't lack for star power. But as you watch this trio go through their paces, mouthing much of the same exact dialogue heard in the first film, there's no denying that Hepburn, Cary Grant and James Stewart did this much better. Our new trio of stars isn't bad by any means, they give a game effort. But the spark The Philadelphia Story had just isn't there. Even with so many of the same words, the sharp wit seems to be missing. The interactions between the three lead characters never quite sizzle the way they did the first time around.So all of that makes High Society sound like a rather lousy film. But while it is largely disappointing there are enough small pleasures scattered throughout to make it at least passable. The role of pampered socialite and ice princess Tracy Lord, the final part Kelly would play in her brief acting career, suits the soon to be real-life princess perfectly. Crosby and Sinatra don't fit their roles nearly as well, certainly not as well as Grant and Stewart did. But the two legendary crooners do have their moments, including a duet which is one of the film's few musical highlights and which would be notable anyway if for no other reason than it was a Crosby/Sinatra duet. Louis Armstrong pops up now and again to provide some jazz and some smiles. Celeste Holm is mostly shunted away into the background aside from one duet with Sinatra in which she is, rather unsurprisingly, not much of a match for The Voice. Kelly's musical contribution is minimal, a few lines in her one duet with Crosby and she does fine with that. When you've got Crosby, Sinatra and Armstrong in your movie you may as well let them do most of the singing. Shame though that the songs they're given are generally so unremarkable and in many cases ill-fitting. This just isn't a story which lends itself to the musical treatment. But despite its flaws and missteps High Society manages at least a small measure of success. Kelly's terrific, Crosby and Sinatra manage well enough and there's enough charming stuff here to make the film at least mildly enjoyable. It's no The Philadelphia Story. Making the film was a rather bad idea right from the start. But High Society ends up being at least a reasonably decent film.",High Society
47,Karl Self,What a swell movie this is!,7,25 September 2008,"I'm a hillbilly so when I started watching High Society I wasn't aware that it was the musical, Technicolor, sans-Katharine-Hepburn-version of Philadelphia Story. I first noticed that they had ""stolen"" the role and actress who played the precocious younger sister of Tracy Lord, then I saw that the setup was also identical (swinging ex-husband attends his ex-wife's wedding to a square), finally when the names were also identical and Tracy raved on about boats being ""yare"" and her father about how he deserved to have a daughter who overlooked him having affairs with showgirls, I finally woke up and smelled the coffee.I thought that Philadelphia Story was probably a great play but a miserable movie as they had just filmed the play on live sets rather than on a stage. In that respect High Society is a big improvement as it's far less static and in Technicolor, and it's got a few really great songs (well, three actually -- the High Society Calypso, Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? and Well, Did You Evah!).Katharine Hepburn of course beats Grace Kelly, and Cary Grant Frank Sinatra hands-down. Kelly's acting is great actually, and she is unbelievably pretty, but Katharine Hepburn has that sassiness which practically makes her Tracy Lord. Bing Crosby is pretty cool in Cary Grant's shoes. Louis Armstrong's role is one as token black guy who smiles and swings a lot and lends credibility to Bing Cosby -- African-Americans had yet a long way to go in 1956.Like in the original I thought that the ""breaking down"" of Tracy Lord from haughty to docile is strange and creepy and pretty dated. At the same time the idea that a woman would cheat on her husband the night before her wedding is as shocking now as it was in 1940 and 1956. And like in the original, I never understood what was so fundamentally wrong about Tracy Lord's husband-to-be except that he wasn't born rich.If you like retro movies and especially musicals, then this one is going to be all the way up your street.",High Society

Now she plans to marry George Kittredge, a social climber with a sense of propriety as inflexible as her own--only to find her wedding suddenly beset by her first husband, two pesky reporters, the possibility of a paternal scandal, and a local jazz fest.If all this sounds a bit familiar, it should be no surprise. Originally written for the stage by Philip Barry under the title THE PHILADELPHIA STORY, it proved a smash hit during the 1940s on both stage and screen, and this remake follows the original very closely, only fiddling with the story and characters to the extent of introducing and rationalizing Cole Porter's musical elements.The original non-musical film cast included Katherine Hepburn, Cary Grant, and James Stewart--a hard act to follow, to say the least. But while they don't best that teaming, stars Grace Kelly (Tracy), Bing Crosby (C.K. Dexter-Haven), and Frank Sinatra (Mike Connor, one of the reporters) carry off the roles with considerable charm. But the real strength of this film is the guest appearance of Louis Armstrong and the Cole Porter score. Only Porter would be brazen enough to write lyrics that rhyme Circe with Mercy, and while this is one of his lesser efforts it is still pretty impressive stuff, including such memorable tunes as ""True Love,"" the satirical ""Well, Did You Ever?,"" and such throw-away charmers as ""Little One."" As for Louis Armstrong, his star quality is powerful enough to put even Sinatra in the shade.The failure of the film is the fact that every one in the cast seems to play a bit too casually, and although they are all clearly having a good time they never really achieve the sparkle a truly great musical comedy requires. Even so, musical fans--particularly those of Cole Porter, Armstrong, Crosby, and Sinatra--will find it quite enjoyable, and Grace Kelly fans will find the actress as lovely as ever.

Tracy Lord is very beautiful. She poses in glamorous costumes. People -- her little sister, her mother, her father, her ex-husband, her fiancé -- walk up to her and communicate to her what a failure as a human being she is. Tracy is told she is hard, virginal, cold. Her father is really, really mad at her because he left his wife, her mother, for a much younger stripper, and Tracy didn't show him any ""warmth."" So, that makes her a -- well, you know the word. It's all so icky. The original play was purchased and tailored for Katharine Hepburn, at a time when she was considered box office poison. She was considered too haughty, too upper class, not warm enough. So, Tracy Lord / Katharine Hepburn / Grace Kelly is really beautiful, and aristocratic, and we all envy her for that, and she is starred in a role where people give her a hard time for being beautiful and aristocratic. Ew! Maybe any of this would be tolerable if ""High Society"" were not so starchy, dull, immobile, incomprehensible and dead on the screen. ""High Society"" is boringly staged. Actors pose flat on the screen, as if they were in a stage play. Action is slow and unbelievable.""High Society"" is meant to take place among multimillionaires. You could recreate the sets by shopping at a Salvation Army. They are simply tacky. Bing Crosby, one of the greats, appears old enough to be Tracy's father, and this does nothing to add to the romance between them. His character makes no sense whatsoever. He's the millionaire grandson of a robber baron, and also, somehow, personal friends with Louis Armstrong, and a great jazz singer? This doesn't follow the logic of conventional musicals -- Crosby / Dexter-Haven performs on a stage in front of his fellow millionaires. I don't think so.Frank Sinatra sings one good song, and that's fun, but they did something weird to his hair -- is that ... could it be ... SHOE POLISH???!!! Grace Kelly is a very beautiful woman, but she needs a good director -- Alfred Hitchcock, say -- to use her. Watching her pose in fabulous costumes gets a bit old.Celeste Holm is utterly wasted. She and Sinatra have as much chemistry together as ... well ... as Celeste Holm and Frank Sinatra.Tracy's father is one of the most unpleasant characters ever written, and he's played by a B movie actor who, after this, went back to his successful career as a crash test dummy.Skip it.

51,jem132,It's absolutely charming,8,17 October 2007,"MGM's 1956 musical update of it's hit 1940 comedy THE PHILADELPHIA STORY (starring Hepburn, Grant and Stewart)is one of the better re-makes of a classic that Hollywood has ever attempted. In fact, the re-make itself is a classic- the unbeatable melodic talents of Crosby and Sinatra and a stunning Grace Kelly make this a very enjoyable outing indeed.Kelly (in her final film role) effortlessly plays Tracy Lord, an ice-cool society queen who is on the eve of marrying her second husband, a stuffed-shirt social climber- that is, until musician and ex-husband C.K Dexter Haven (Bing Crosby) re-appears on the scene. Crosby is obviously still in love with Kelly, and we know who Grace belongs with- until Mike Connor (Frank Sinatra), a reporter sent to cover the ceremony, enters the equation. Suddenly we have three potential suitors for Tracy and one rollicking musical celebration!This film, along with the earlier THE COUNTRY GIRL, contains one of Kelly's best screen performances. It's an ideal role for her, as the goddess who really ""doesn't want to be worshiped-just want to be loved"", and Grace really shines. Crosby had starred alongside Kelly in THE COUNTRY GIRL, and they continue their excellent on-screen chemistry together. The musical talents of Crosby and Sinatra are always a highlight to watch in any film, and their work here is among their best. The songbook is very good, with every number entertaining and serving a purpose to the narrative.Celeste Holm plays Liz Imbrie, Mike's photographer sidekick who is really in love with him. Sinatra and Holm's famous number ""Who wants to be a millionaire?"" is perhaps the highlight of the piece. Unfortunately Holm, who did some excellent work in GENTLEMAN'S AGREEMENT and ALL ABOUT EVE, is under-used here, and seems to be a little past her prime. Yet she's a pleasant sidekick to Sinatra, with director Walters obviously inspired to cast this wisecracking New York blonde based on the unavailability of Betty Garrett (who had worked with Sinatra in ON THE TOWN and TAKE ME OUT TO THE BALL GAME).

54,disinterested_spectator,Some Interesting Changes in This Remake,6,23 November 2014,"In some ways, this remake of ""The Philadelphia Story"" is an improvement. In the original version, Dexter pushed Tracy in the face so hard it knocked her to the ground, which does not seem as funny to us today as it apparently did then. In this remake, that scene is eliminated. Perhaps the difference in actors is also a factor. To have Bing Crosby push Grace Kelly in the face would have had different connotations than it did for Cary Grant to do that to Katherine Hepburn.Another improvement is the elimination of Dexter's alcoholism. In the original version, he was an alcoholic and it was Tracy's fault. Furthermore, the implication was that she was wrong to divorce him for it. Because this remake is a musical, the new reason Tracy divorces Dexter is that he composes popular jazz numbers, which are too lowbrow for her taste. She wanted him to be a diplomat or at least a composer of highbrow music. This is an improvement over the original because it is outrageous to blame a wife for her husband's alcoholism, and because it brings out the idea that she is a bit of a snob. On the other hand, objecting to the musical compositions of one's husband has to be the most frivolous reason for a divorce ever given, on or off the screen.Another improvement is that the musical numbers in this remake take the place of a lot of the excessive drunk-humor that went on in the original. There is still a lot of drinking, but the less of that sort of thing the better. The musical numbers also call for the elimination of a couple of plot points. In the original, Mike had written a book, which Tracy marveled over for its sensitive understanding of human nature, but that is eliminated in the remake. It is just as well. We might believe that Jimmy Stewart could write such a book, but not Frank Sinatra. Also, there was a counter-blackmail conspiracy between Dexter and Mike that is eliminated. It did not lead to anything much in the original, so it is no great loss.Dexter still does not want Tracy to marry George, but his attempt to prevent their wedding is not as aggressive as it was in the original. That too is an improvement, because interfering in an ex-wife's wedding plans is offensive. What unfortunately remains in all its disgusting glory is the scene where her father announces that if a husband cheats on his wife, it is none of his wife's business, followed by his putting all the blame on Tracy: if a man does not have a devoted, loving daughter, he cannot be blamed if he has sex with a devoted, loving woman as a substitute.George is still depicted as being a prig for objecting to the way Tracy carries on the night before their wedding. First he catches her and Dexter smooching, and then she goes on to do some lovey-dovey necking with Mike. If this is the way she behaves the night before her wedding, what would George be in for as the years rolled by? I have known men with wives like that, and I always feel sorry for them (even if I am the one she is fooling around with). Maybe Tracy is just following her father's logic: her philandering is none of her fiancé's concern. Besides, she has the excuse that she does not have a devoted, loving son to keep her from wandering.In the original, after George refused to go through with the wedding, Mike asked Tracy to marry her. When she declined, Elizabeth immediately took him back, as if he was just a little boy who still had some growing up to do. We are fortunately spared this scene. Instead, Mike asks Elizabeth to marry him, which is much better.

Dexter Haven (Frank Sinatra), but when a couple of journalists from a seedy magazine are sent to cover the wedding, and one of them, Macaulay 'Mike' Connor (Bing Crosby) falls for Tracy, everything gets kinda confused...This is a remake of the 1940 movie 'The Philadelphia Story', but the acting is very misguided and amateurish (it's ridiculous to consider Grace Kelly's performance in this one for an Academy Award, much less awarding it of one), the appearance of 'Satchmo' and the songs have a jarring effect, as they immediately pull you out of the story, and well... the movie on the whole is really inferior to the original.But the biggest damage is done by Grace Kelly; the character may be a cold-hearted witch, but that is no reason for such poor acting. Maybe, if she tried to study a little the performance given by Katherine Hepburn in the original (the actress the part was written for, by the way), she could've done a decent job...High Society: 3/10.",High Society

Sinatra looked uncomfortable the entire time, with his shoe polish hair, and Celeste Holm spat out terrible lines flatly.Speaking of overrated, Cole Porter songs fill me with the urge to defecate!

57,dimplet,Astonishingly innocuous,6,25 July 2011,"Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby, Louis Armstrong, music by Cole Porter, how could you go wrong?Director Charles Walters found a way. The question is, what is the secret of his failure?I've often wondered why remakes don't just keep the script of a successful film and re-shoot it in color, stereo, 3D, whatever? This time, someone did, keeping the script of The Philadelphia Story remarkably intact, with some substitutions of dialogue here or there that are usually as good as the original. So what went wrong?The bottom line is High Society is astonishingly innocuous, where The Philadelphia Story was an electric mix of battery acid and champagne. OK, Grace Kelly is not Katherine Hepburn, and she doesn't try to be. But she isn't even Grace Kelly. People seem to be just reading their lines and not interacting most of the time. In The Barkleys of Broadway, Walters made the same mistake; the acting is just shallow. I wish they could have hired Frank Capra to direct, he always got emotion out of his actors. Somehow, Walters turned The Philadelphia Story into a boring, boring movie. I'm not a technical expert on these things, but the Average Shot Length of 14 seconds may provide a clue. While, on the one hand, I feel the acting needs to be slowed down a micro-notch to let the acting breathe, the film already seems slow, and I guess these long shots may be a reason. Your attention fades out, and next thing you know, you're wondering why the characters are doing this or that; the story, like the original, has a habit of shifting gears a lot, but here the shifts seem sudden and unexplained. So, if you keep your attention focused, this movie works better.I picked a scene at random, of Frank Sinatra holding Grace Kelly and kissing. The shoot lasted for about one minute and 15 seconds. The material suggests a dizzying feeling, of fading out from reality. Yet there is no camera movement, except a small pan at the beginning and end. Grace Kelly in Sinatra's arms, and it is boring. There are a lot of these static camera talking-head scenes of actors with their feet nailed to the floor. No zooms, pans or cuts. Most often, the scene is shoot very wide, from a distance, often showing both shoes and lots of space above the heads, which are very small in the wide scene, so you can't see much expression, especially when they are talking in profile. For modern audiences, this is deadly. But not necessarily; there are some long shots in ""Harvey"" of Jimmy Stewart just talking, but he moves, walks over, sits down, while the camera follows and zooms in, and the soliloquy is powerful, where this dialogue is not. In Harvey, the long shots help hold attention on the words. Cole Porter was in poor health and getting old when he wrote this. But it is as good or better than much of the music written for movies. The most memorable tune is ""True Love,"" a classic. It is fun seeing Sinatra and Crosby singing a duet, ""Well, Did You Evah?"" And it is a special treat to see Louis Armstrong and his fantastic ensemble on screen in their prime making some great music in early stereo recordings. I just wish someone had come up with a vehicle to showcase Louis Armstrong more than this. The music is the best reason to watch this movie.If the set looks vaguely familiar, it is not because of the original, but the later use of this real mansion for the TV series, ""The Beverly Hillbillies.""Bosley Crowther hit the nail partly on the head: "" 'High Society,' its new name set to music, is as flimsy as a gossip-columnist's word, especially when it is documenting the weird behavior of the socially elite."" The original's plot was thin, but the acting made it work. Somehow, it seemed close enough to reality to be believable. ""High Society"" bears no resemblance to reality, beyond that of 1950s Hollywood reality. Sure, if you compare this to the original, it is not as good. Yet, ironically, keeping the original in mind somehow makes ""High Society"" better, sort of like having the Playbill in your hand while watching a Broadway play. And with the wide, long shots, it sometimes feels like a play. Oddly, ""High Society"" finally gets into gear in the last 15 minutes or so with some fine acting, but it still feels like watching a play. ""High Society"" is still worth watching, especially for the music. I don't fault the concept of turning the original into a musical. And the tie in to the Newport Jazz Festival, which began in 1954, provided a respectful shot of publicity. The basic premise, of turning the tables on some tabloid journalists, is clever, though it quickly fades out. I couldn't help think of the victims of Rupert Murdoch's News of The World, and how maybe they should have done the same, once they caught on, leaving misleading and goofy messages in the phone mail. Too late now.BTW, notice the cameras used by the photographer, a Nikon S-mount rangefinder (the Nikon F SLR had not yet been created), and a Rolleiflex twin lens reflex using 120 film, which creates 2 1/4 inch square images. This is what a good photojournalist would use at that time, not the silly Speed Graphic 4-by-5 inch sheet film cliché that is used in ""Flawless,"" set in 1960. During the Korean War, Nikon rangefinders took over the photojournalist market from Leica, which also was a 35 mm rangefinder.

The story is very thin, the jokes are silly, the ending is altogether predictable, and even the music is mediocre (in relation to the talent we have here, I mean - it is not BAD music).Grace Kelly is over-acting as so often. I have never understood her fame and success, because she was not that very beautiful either - more wholesome (in her image - her reality was another thing) and pretty than gorgeous. Frank Sinatra is wooden as so often - his talent was singing really, not acting, and he did not have the looks of a leading man either. It is difficult for me to have an opinion of Louis Armstrong in this movie, as I simply do not like his sort of music at the best of times.Bing Crosby carries it all, really, as with so many movies and shows that he is in. He has a healthy distance to all the silly things he has to say and do, and the insipid songs he has to sing.

64,budmassey,What a diminished movie,3,12 July 2009,"High Society is a pale and flimsy remake of The Philadelphia Story. There's no lack of talent here, but, unlike the smoldering synergy of Philadelphia Story, High Society is basically inert and trivial. For example, Grace Kelly, in her final screen performance, is stunningly beautiful, but really fails to make anything of the character that Katherine Hepburn inhabited so glowingly in the original. I kept waiting for the incendiary interplay that made Philadelphia Story so magnificent. It never happened. It was a mistake to cast Sinatra in the role for which James Stewart won an Oscar. Sinatra was at the top of his game crooning ""Mind if I Make Love to You?"" But as an actor, he really wasn't up to the role. Sinatra's cool cat attempt to deliver one of cinemas most smolderingly rendered romantic lines – ""You've got fires banked down in you, hearth-fires and holocausts"" - is hollow and ineffectual by comparison.None of the principles, in point of fact, were up to this film. Even when singing, Crosby, known as the consummate crooner, was really offensive in his murderous attempt at a jazz vocal on ""Now You Has Jazz."" Cole Poter, no jazz master himself, but certainly not the assassin Crosby shows himself to be, clearly deserved better.I don't know if I could have enjoyed this movie in a world where Philadelphia Story hadn't so luminously and memorably pre-empted it decades earlier. Perhaps, with lowered expectations, that would have been possible had Katherine Hepburn, Cary Grant and James Stewart not been so glorious, but what a diminished world that would be.

This was not a great movie and the only reason that I am giving this movie a 7 is because of the song with Bing Crosby and Loius Armstrong and the song with Frank Sinatra and Bing Crosby. They were great songs and performed by some true entertainers. I did like how Louis Armstrong was an omnipotent figure in the movie and at one point decided to play a song to change the tone and momentum of the movie. His little comments were great and it is nice seeing Louis Armstrong loving what he does. The acting was whatever and nothing special. The whole love interests of Ms. Lord are pretty ridiculous and I do not understand how the whole story line was propelled forward. I actually think the mother and sister had some potential, but it just did not become an important part of the story.

Having not seen the 1940 George Cukor classic (it's not available on video or DVD here in Brazil and it's never on TV), this lightweight musical just made me look forward to see the original. THE PHILADELPHIA STORY is said to be one of the top comedies ever (and I don't doubt, since it stars three of my favorite actors and one of my favorite directors), but I think HIGH SOCIETY, while not being one of the best musicals I've seen (SINGIN' IN THE RAIN, MY FAIR LADY and even the recent MOULIN ROUGE are better in my opinion), it's one I'd pick in a boring moment. It's not very long, it's funny, charming, colorful, has some very fine songs- and most of all: Bing Crosby, the wonderful Grace Kelly, Frank Sinatra and Louis Armstrong are on it.

Hollywood in its infinite wisdom continues to do dumb things and this remake of The Philadelphia Story rates right up there as one of the biggest mistakes Hollywood ever made. I can just see how it happened. One night a big name producer was at home channel surfing when he came across The Philadelphia Story and as he watched it he realized the movie had not been remade and not only should it be remade but as a musical. ""What a genius I am,"" the producer chortles. ""That's why they pay me the big bucks."" And so The Philadelphia Story is remade as High Society and therein lies the rub because we witless viewers must then be subjected to one of the biggest travesties in movie history, a film so absurd that one wonders how so much talent could have been talked into being part of something so awful. The only saving grace in this mess is the duet Crosby and Sinatra do which must be one of the best musical bits in film history. It is a triumph as well as a musical milestone.

Why would Frank Sinatra look twice at Kelly's boring rich girl, when he has sparky Celeste Holm right by his side?

There isn't even any fun to be had from the supporting cast, Uncle Willy is a cypher and scheming editor Sidney Kidd disappears completely. Louis Armstrong adds some life to the proceedings, but was he the only performer at the Newport Jazz Festival that year? The direction is incredibly dull, just a series of VistaVision mid-shots which keeps the actors miles away from the audience, and some of the clumsy goofs mean the boom microphone should have got its own 'also featuring' credit.Everybody seems to have been asleep on this job: cast, crew, director and producers.",High Society

When I finally saw PS I felt like it was strangely detached and slow because there were no musical numbers in it. But all that aside...The film shimmers like silk and flows like champagne- very much like the ritzy atmosphere it's set in, and I think that's sort of the point. It's the playground of the idle rich. Bing Crosby's performance is so casual throughout that he often appears like he's about to drift off to sleep, but he's part of that oh-so-elegant atmosphere, as is Grace Kelly (she of the immaculate beauty and the strangest speaking voice in Hollywood). They're nicely buffered by the stunningly dry wit of Celeste Holm and the Brooklynseque effervescence of both Frank Sinatra and Louis Armstrong. Speaking of Armstrong, many have commented on his unique position as Greek chorus of the film- usually citing ""Now You Has Jazz"" as his best moment. For me, the best moment is Armstrong and his band rehearsing the love song 'Samantha,' referenced earlier as Kelly's middle name and expressly written for her. A series of crane shots flows from Armstrong's muted trumpet to Crosby's dressing room where he slips into the song (and his tuxedo) effortlessly. Then we cut to an admiring Kelly listening the whole time from her open window. The whole sequence is gorgeous, and when the song ends it is a satisfied Armstrong who gets the crafty fadeout line, ""now we're getting warm."" Smooth as silk!!",High Society

The original film was great, but this is a new film in a new style and that kind of comparison is just wrong.Besides, how can you hate a movie that has Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra and Louis Armstrong? Just seeing these pros sing these Cole Porter songs make this film a real delight. Another complaint are some of the changes in the story, like making Crosby's singer sober for this film. Those who want to see Crosby play an alcoholic should see ""The Country Girl"", in which he turns in a brilliant performance. This is a light musical comedy and making Grace Kelly's character hate Crosby's style of music just makes sense in that context.The acting is fine also. Crosby is so comfortable at this kind of film that he just sits back and has a good time. So does the audience. Sinatra is solid as usual as the reporter. Louis Armstrong is fun in his scenes with Crosby. A liability is Grace Kelly, who plays the role too realistically and as a result the fun drains away when she's on screen alone. I've never much cared for Kelly's acting as she pretty much gives the same performance in every picture.

But I could appreciate it much more after viewing this inane, dull remake of the story.  In the non-musical scenes, in which the writers both unabashedly lift dialogue straight from the movie (and, presumably, the play it was based on) and throw in some of their own confections, no one comes near their ""Philadelphia"" predecessors in their delivery of the lines.  I never really imagined myself saying this, but they just aren't as smart or sharp or witty as the original cast.  Poor Grace Kelly makes an ass of herself in her last film, and poor Frank Sinatra and Celeste Holm are largely wasted and completely mismatched.  The supporting cast, particularly the mother and the young sister, are also embarrassing.The only things that save this film are Cole Porter's lively songs, especially ""Well, Did You Evah?"" and the rumba number, in which Sinatra and Kelly show themselves to be the only well-matched couple in the movie and display some good chemisry, as well as the one and only Satchmo's wonderful opening rendition of the title song (The film can only go downhill from there) and ""Now You Has Jazz.""  Bing Crosby's likeable performance, the only non-embarassing one in the movie (except Satchmo's) also helps.Maybe I would have liked this movie better if I hadn't seen The Philadelphia Story beforehand, but then again, I didn't love The Philadephia Story until I saw this movie.

Grace Kelly made her final film appearance here as Tracy Lord, the spoiled Newport heiress torn between her current fiancée (John Lund), her songwriter ex-husband, Dexter (Bing Crosby) and a reporter (Frank Sinatra) sent to her home to cover her wedding. Crosby, Kelly, and Sinatra light up the screen here, making the most of their roles here. Crosby and Sinatra have a classic duet called ""Well, did you evah"" and Sinatra croons ""You're Sensational"" to Kelly in a way that's guaranteed to melt your heart. There is also a solid supporting turn from Celeste Holm as Liz Imbrie, Sinatra's photographer who also harbors a secret crush on him and Louis Calhern is very amusing as Kelly's Uncle Willie, a classic dirty old man.

75,Calysta,Barely tolerable remake of an MGM classic,7,30 January 2000,"Ensembling the usage of intrusive technicolour with the settings and the very characters that made ""The Philadelphia Story"" such irrisistable entertainment, it is hardly expected that even the usually brilliant talents of Bing Crosby, Grace Kelly and Frank Sinatra are supposed to outdo the cinematic legends of Katharine Hepburn, Cary Grant and Jimmy Stewart.
If that was to be the expected outcome, the idea of updating ""The Philadelphia Story"" with Cole Porter would therefore be a horrible mistake.
Most sorely absent, is the humour which made its masterpiece predecessor work. Previous one-liners have been disguised without success. In laughing, in the most sporadic form where a laugh is being begged for, I felt more dutiful towards Philip Barry than anyone else involved with the musical's production. Recycled comedy spoiled to the extent of embarrassment, even with another trio of stars, has rarely been pulled off with flaws of production quickly evident. Nice trimmings seem to be what is expected to save such a production, with tasteful predominating modern ornateness wanting to save the day. Pretty costumes and sets never make a great movie alone. Although Cole Porter's songs are slightly below their greatness, interesting songs including ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"" and ""What a Swell Party this is"" are partially awakening highlights of the disaster. And watching three talents at all time lows who seem to apparently have their feet connected to the front columns of the Lord's mansions for all the interest in the project, certainly doesn't assist with flaw after flaw.I guess I'm just another one of those people who just hate it when Hollywood classic masterpieces are ruined.

Now I haven't lost my marbles and I am not suggesting that Cole Porter is Verdi. What I mean is that the story is so preposterous (as are most Opera plots) that it is best not to question it too closely and just enjoy the movie. Porter's music is sensational (to coin a phrase) and the songs are all well performed. Grace Kelly's rendition of ""True Love"" (yes, it is her - not dubbed) is delicious and just adds to her allure. Isn't it wonderful just how sexy Ms Kelly is in this film? This is 1956 and there is no flashing of bosom or even leg  just her natural beauty. She spends some time in the bedroom with Frank Sinatra and (improbably) remains chaste. Frank the honourable man!I watched ""The Philadelphia Story"" again recently and was surprised how much of the script from that movie was retained for ""High Society"". If you find the story of High Society silly (it is) then it is really the earlier film you should blame.

WOW!When you go to the Opera you want great music, good performances, lovely sets and some sort of feel good factor. With ""High Society"" you get all this and more.

80,dgz78,What's The Point,4,15 February 2006,"First the good. Cole Porter was one of the greatest songwriters of the 20th century. Frank Sinatra was maybe the greatest singer of the twentieth century and Bing Crosby was close behind (though not as good as Mel Torme). Celeste Holm was a great singer too and Grace Kelley was as beautiful as any actress of her day. And Louis Armostrong was arguably the greatest jazz musician of the last century (I know - a great case can be made for Davis, Monk Coltrane etc).Here's the but.So with all this great talent, why isn't this musical remake of The Philedelphia Story better? Crosby, Sinatra, Kelly & Holm, as good as they are, are nowhere near the actors that Hepburn Stewart, Hussey and especially Cary Grant were. If you've seen The PS, it's hard to watch High Society without thinking of the original and how much better the acting was.And the biggest thing missing was the role of Tracy's younger sister. In High Society, she shows up at the beginning and is hard to spot her after Sinatra and Holm arrive. Virginia Weidler was so good in The PS and I guess her part was reduced to get in more of the musical numbers.Right off the top of my head I can't think of a successful musical that was made out of a successful movie. Usually they are mere curiosities (think Peter O'Toole and Petula Clark in Goodbye, Mr Chips) so maybe High Society is as good as it can get when you have a favorite movie to compare it to. Expectations are hard to beat.Maybe it would have been more successful as an original musical (goodness knows MGM knew how to make some great ones).

It doesn't help to watch The Philadelphia Story and High Society in quick succession, because it's quite obvious that Grace studied Katharine Hepburn's performance and is copying her blatantly. I guess mimicry takes some skill, but I'd rather see a different actress do her own interpretation, instead of a pointless imitation. Even if it might be intimidating, especially since Katharine originated the role on the stage as well. Heck, it was pretty much written for Hepburn, tailored to suit her and help her career at a time she was considered ""Box-Office Poison"". It's not that I think Kate's an untouchable goddess (like her character ;)) - in fact, Hepburn's mannerisms can get on my nerves. But at least she had her own style. As far as I can tell, Grace Kelly...didn't.Remakes usually stink, but I'm not completely in love with the original anyway (see my IMDb review). High Society is worth seeing for Bing Crosby, Louis Armstrong, and the addition of some great songs. Bing is just as charming as Cary Grant was in the role (but in his *own* way!), however, Frank Sinatra is a poor replacement for Jimmy Stewart. Although I like Sinatra in his earlier MGM musicals, when he had a shy, awkward, innocent persona (yes, really), by this point Frank was becoming cocky, and much less likable as a misogynistic ladies man than he was when he played guys who were nervous around women. Poor Celeste Holm, such a smart, witty presence and always enjoyable to watch, gets to pine over unappreciative Frank, in both this movie and The Tender Trap. She really deserves better.My favorite bit in High Society is the musical number ""Well, Did You Evah?"", where we get to see Bing and Frank try to upstage each other. Well, Frank tries. Bing doesn't even *have* to try - that's the beauty of it. With his laidback, natural charm, he just steals the scene effortlessly. Frank hams it up, playing ""drunk"" in an over-the-top way. Meanwhile, Bing, for the most part, just sits there, delivering some great one-liners (the way he says ""Don't hurt yourself"" just cracks me up), as he watches Frank make a fool of himself. And no matter what Sinatra does, your eyes follow Crosby. Even when he's just sitting there. I always marvel over that. He is cool. He is charismatic. He is Bing Crosby! There's nobody like him.",High Society

85,polar24,Join in the belly-laughs!,6,17 January 2007,"This second rendition of the exuberant play by John Barry, while inferior to Cukor's 1940 version, remains a delightful farce on the upper class thanks to the witty, sparkling script from the play by John Barry.The cast is commendable albeit not spectacular given , showcasing the drollery of the script. Grace Kelly (in her last complete screen performance) surprises us with her comedic talents helped along by the script; Crosby slips into the comfortable role of the guy-next-door that is all too familiar with his screen person. Sinatra (showing some of his age) sings adequately, but seems a little distant and lacks the edge, danger and sexiness of his 1940 counterpart.I might only add that the 3 principals seemed to lack that spark which validated their freewheeling around L.A singing songs about making love. On screen I did not feel they were as youthful and vibrant as seen in some of their earlier films.The direction by Charles Walters - an accomplished director of film musicals including Gigi, Ziegfeld Follies, and Annie get your Gun - supports the cast very well with various long shots of the mansion and sunny California. He is splendidly able to infuse the house with it's sparkling jewels and ornaments with a sense of grandeur, merriment and delight so that it fully inhabits the characters and their kingdom.The scene-stealer each time is Louis Armstrong and his band. While his interludes are not his best pieces to showcase, the music is pleasant, dreamy and fun. What else would you expect from this rollicking comedy? And how can you not love Armstrong? He was so adorable!It was interesting to note the audience's reaction to this film. Musicals are one of my favourite genres - I love them for the swooning and swinging numbers - however the audience did not appreciate it so much. There were even groans and boos (which I found disrespectful - you must know it's a musical!) when Sinatra and Kelly burst into dreamy love duets. I have to admit though that the transition of the songs in the film was not altogether seamless (even choppy at times). At times it seemed like a selling point for the producers to capitalise on the musical craze sweeping the country during that period in Hollywood (See Kelly and Sinatra sing!); add name dropping, and songs & lyrics that misrepresent Cole Porter's skill and wit as a composer.This is a fun film however deeply overshadowed by the original 1940 version and lacking Cuckor's razor-sharp screwball slapstick. The pace is also slower however it probably compensates for delighting us with the elegant sets and musical interludes.I was also fortunate to see this film with audience and definitely relished hearing the viewers chortle along to the absurd story and zany characters. It was impossible not to join in the belly-laughs in this dreamy ride.",High Society

That said, this is a terrible movie based on a good one, and would be a mediocre movie even if I knew nothing about The Philadelphia Story. I will base my review knowing it came from The Philadelphia Story. All the edge and wit of the original are GONE. The changes made to the plot and dialogue took them away. So, when the plot/dialogue returns word for word to the original, it loses its impact. And the songs are sadly distracting and just not all that impelling for the story. Sorry, Cole Porter. Lastly, the acting is really not that good. Grace Kelly overacts, Bing Crosby barely acts, and Frank Sinatra waits for another reason to sing. All from people we know are better. I watched this because I knew I should, and wished I hadn't. For those who gave it a glowing review, or even a decent one - well, okay. Just not something I could do.

With Sinatra at the height of his powers and THOSE songs?Most of the lower scores for this film are from people who get hung up about the fact that this is a lesser remake of the brilliant Philadelphia Story. My advice would be to look on that film as separately as you can. In terms of plot, script and (to a lesser extent) performance this is indeed a simplification. Tracey's ""arc"" seems clunkier and more hurried and Crosby loses so much romantic screen time to Sinatra that when the final romantic denouement happens you think ""where did THAT come from"".BUT - it still works just fine and the songs are simply..er..sensational. Grace Kelly is lovely and funny even if there is a bit of a Katherine Hepburn impersonation going on, and Sinatra delivers the funniest lines in the film with great timing. And, of course, the boy can sing.For me the only slight false note comes from Louis Armstrong's monosyllabic commentary on the action. We KNOW where our sympathies lie, Louis - you don't need to tell us! But his songs - and the band - are as great as anything else in the film.Final shout out for Celeste Holm -her performance is the best and most layered in the film.Overall - the simplification of Philadelphia Story works well enough and any minus points are almost entirely made up for by the exuberant performances of Cole Porter's great songs.",High Society

Gone is the vivacity, wittiness, poignancy and the romance of a wonderful story. Am I supposed to believe that a beautiful young woman of 27 is happily marrying a not very attractive 45 year old? That she finds nothing surprising at being surrounded by short unattractive men who are each older than the other and the main love interest is 53 years old! Watching her surrounded by these old guys I felt the same disgust and distaste I felt when watching The Seven Year Itch - beautiful Ms Monroe being ogled by a a pervy old man. And everyone acts as if this is normal! It is beyond comprehension and utterly unconvincing. Sure the guys can sing - well then find them a love interest of their own age!

The banter between them, the way they react with one another is the best of any movie. The dialogue flows effortlessly and will make even the most heartless viewer smile.

You may be wondering why Grace is re-marrying Bing Crosby, he is not really attractive, but he is an excellent singer and entertainer and matches the movie perfectly! The songs by Cole Porter are classics up to this day (""True Love""), they are shot beautifully and are a pleasure, my personal favorite is ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"" with Frank Sinatra and the great Celeste Holm as the ""funny couple"" in this picture.

What is the role of a movie? There are many. When I'm feeling blue this kind of movie always makes me feel happy; how can that be a bad thing? The music is simply wonderful, and I'm not really a ""musical"" fan; its just the sheer talent of Porter, Sinatra, Crosby,  and of course Louis; a combination of such talent which you will rarely find. The music is also very skillfully and effortlessly placed into the story line, that you hardly realize it is a ""musical"". Some social commentary is relevant today, such as the ""privileges"" of the rich and superficiality of such, and the eternal problem of making bad decisions in marriage. I have a spirited creative friend who is involved with a ""stable"" secure guy, but remains uncertain and confused as to her reasons for marrying him, apart from the fact that she wants to make him happy, I gather for reasons of guilt about her self-confessed selfishness and need for absolution; Grace Kelly in her role has the same doubts and motives I think and is willing to go through with it for no obvious reason; just because ""its there"", and the guy is stable but absolutely lacking in spirit and soul. I have another friend who has never considered marriage because she is surrounded by ""privileged"" people or guys obsessed with money; she believes in 'True Love"" and would marry for no other reason no matter the class or financial status of the guy...so these dilemmas are real in the 21st century, so I found the understated attitudes in the film relevant. Of course in those days the films had to have a happy ending; not so in reality, so the escapist element is good for the soul too, especially for a romantic and eternal optimist like myself.

A bonus is the appearance of Louis Armstrong and his combo of the time. When Armstrong performs, by himself or with Crosby, the film takes on the aspect of a priceless document of an inimitable talent.Oh, did I mention that the score is by Cole Porter?

Which was why I wondered what in the world made this movie fail.  It came nowhere near as close to the brilliance of ""The Philadelphia Story,"" as well as failing to even be a good musical.The script was not as tight as in the original.  It came off as being far too contrived and an overall horrible redo of the original.  They seemed to stretch the script a bit thin in an attempt to make the musical aspect of it seem logical, and fell flat on its face doing so.The songs were not really that good in my opinion.  I think a good musical leaves you humming the song after you hear it, or maybe even singing along of you know the song.  The songs had no such effect on me this time, unlike a great musical like ""The Sound of Music"" or ""My Fair Lady.""Perhaps the greatest disappointment was just how poor everyone's acting was in this movie. For one, there was absolutely no chemistry whatsoever between Grace Kelly and Frank Sinatra or between Kelly and Bing Crosby.  To use my previous terminology, everyone's acting seemed far too contrived.  The rest of the supporting cast was also highly disappointing, especially when compared to the original ""Philadelphia Story Cast""Grace Kelly's acting was outright horrible.  She was excellent in ""Rear Window"" and in ""High Noon,"" so I expected much out of her in this movie. Was I ever let down.  Sinatra was great in ""The Manchurian Candidate"" and fairly good in ""From Here to Eternity,"" but gave a horrible acting performance in this film (I also think his acting sucks in ""Guys and Dolls"").  I think the fault must be the director's fault, since I know all of the actors could have and have elsewhere done excellent jobs.I gave this movie a 4 out of 10.

I don't know if this happened a lot in mid-50's movies, but seeing an Armstrong/Crosby/Sinatra combo in one movie was cool. Grace Kelly and all those guys in moustaches were really good too. Their performances were great comedically and portrayed the narrative very well. I'd say they were good emotionally, but this movie is so light-hearted it would suffer from being emotionally deep in any way. The introduction of Sinatra and Holm's characters was a standout point for me, because it just lifted happiness levels even more. They're addition to the mix of music and laughs (and husbands) was brilliant, because they were all involved in a charming way. They're musical number was a treat, one that I would usually be disinterested in. It's not amazing, but it's good for what it is.

All the supporting actors (except Louie) are miscast or just bad (and Louie is not given anything to do, there is a Newport Jazz Festival, but you'd never know it with this movie). The director uses mostly boring mid-shots, just terrible. Grace Kelly is beautiful, but you would not know it - where are the close ups?! Watching this after seeing The Philadelphia Story was painful. I like this when I saw it in the '60's, but it does not stand up, mainly due to the pathetic directing. Dull.",High Society
113,smartygirl,a disappointing remake,4,27 March 2001,"Seeing High Society and The Philadelphia Story back-to-back really shows up the shortcomings of the former.The best dialogue (and a few important plot points) are stripped away not just to make room for the musical numbers, but to make the film a wee bit less thought-provoking for a fifties audience. For example, when Mr. Lord is justifying his ""affair"" with a dancer, he adds in a line about their relationship being ""innocent."" Easier for them clean-cut types to handle, I guess. There is much dumbing down throughout the film, and Grace Kelly just isn't as sharp as Katherine Hepburn.Watch the original instead!",High Society
114,cynsunshine,A marvelous must-see!,10,22 March 2001,"This movie is a renamed remake of The Philadelphia Story (1940).  It is funny, charming, delightful, and somewhat different from the original. One addition to this version is Louis Armstrong, a man who is always delightful every time I watch him on film.Any movie that includes two great talents like Frank Sinatra and Bing Crosby gets my vote.  Bing is perfect as Dexter and Frank is as dreamy as ever as reporter Mike Connor.  Both Voices (that's a capital V on purpose) sing superbly as usual in this musical comedy.Grace Kelly does a wonderful job as upper crust divorcee Tracy Lord.  She plays the role of a holier-than-thou rich girl and a compassionate young woman to a tee.  I highly recommend watching this one!",High Society

Crosby and Sinatra are GREAT SINGERS and their duet ""Well, Did You Evah!"" is witty toe-tapping fun!  Louie Armstrong's performance in the film ain't chopped liver either -- he's just so cool, hip -- and lovable!  Frank doing ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire (I Don't)"" is terrific.  And as far as Grace Kelly is concerned: she's gorgeous, charming and her duet with Bing on the Oscar-nominated ""True Love"" is still a delight after all these years.  I'd recommend this film for several of Cole Porter's wonderful songs (others are duds).  Having said this, however, the film's biggest problem is, unfortunately, its script which is as flat as last night's champagne.",High Society

Adding to the tension is her skirt-chasing father, who's also returned home for the ceremony. The resulting confusion--and several potent drinks--melt the ice princess's frosty exterior. It isn't long before she sees through her society-climbing fiancée, and warms up again to her crooning jazz musician ex-husband. Rare chance to see rivals Crosby and Sinatra together.

Grace Kelly can't sing or dance; a double threat. Aside from ""I Don't"", there was not one good number in this movie. I would not recommend that you watch it.",High Society
119,peytone,Pretty good. More enjoyable than The Philadelphia Story!,8,17 February 2017,"I was somewhat disappointed with the original version, The Philadelphia Story, when I watched it. Though James Stewart's acting was great, for some reason the movie just wasn't too enjoyable for me.When I found this movie, until I read the synopsis I had no clue it was a remake. That being said, I think that High Society made some improvements over its predecessor. The casting in both movies is no doubt great. Many people enjoy Katharine Hepburn in TPS, but I found her annoying.I am a little biased towards Grace Kelly in general but I enjoyed her performance much better than Hepburn's. Making this story a musical helps liven up the whole thing and makes it more enjoyable to see. My favorite was the jazz song by Louis Armstrong and his band with Bing Crosby. Plus, three great musicians are in the cast. What more could you ask for? The ending in both flicks is the same. I'm not giving too much away but I think it comes out of left field (less so in this one). I guess this divorcée romance type of story isn't my cup of tea. Another pet peeve: this movie loves wide shots. Perhaps there are too many.Overall, the performances here are very enjoyable, both acting and musically, and you will be charmed to no end by Grace Kelly and entertained by the music. If you didn't care for The Philadelphia Story, you'll find that High Society improves a story a bit and is overall more fun.7/10 stars.",High Society
120,vrlayer,Classic Musical,10,22 October 2019,"If you're looking for a Hollywood Classic, High Society is the movie to watch!High Society is a musical based on the original movie ""The Philadelphia Story"" with Katherine Hepburn, James Stewart and Cary Grant.High Society stars A-List actors, actresses and singers such as: Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby, Grace Kelly, Celeste Holms and Louis Armstrong. All these amazing entertainers put on a power house performance. Not only that, but the music is extremely catching and meaningful.The beginning of the movie opens up with Armstrong scatting a summary about the movie. A high class, entitled woman (Kelly) is engaged to a very dull but high powered man. With Tracy's ex-husband (Crosby) living next door she is annoyed and distracted by his music and surprise appearances. In addition to her ex-husband's surprise appearances, two journalist (Frank Sinatra and Celeste Holms) from ""Spy Magazine"" came for not only the story of Tracy's wedding, but for the scandal that her father might be having an affair.Thus begins a love triangle between Grace Kelly (Tracy), Frank Sinatra (Mike) and Bing Crosby (Dexter.) Along with Celeste Holms's character longing for Mike, but too proud to speak of it. Tracy's soon-to-be husband is feeling left out and in turn wants to keep her caged up. This drives Tracy to do immoral and questionable acts such as swimming in a pool with someone other than her fiancé. Or receiving loving/ thoughtful gifts from her ex-husband, reminding her that being married to him was something she loved. It makes her question everything, her front that she puts on for the journalists, her previous actions and her love for Dexter.Throughout the movie there are hit songs like, ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire"", ""Samantha"", ""True Love"" and the famous duet with Bing and Frank ""Didja Ever?"" With each song more catchier than the other.As for the storytelling and ""behind-the-scenes"" parts of the movie, the set design was magnificent. Some of the parts in the movie were actually filmed on location. The outfits were diverse, at one point Tracy was wearing a khaki jumpsuit and then changed into this beautiful southern bell gown. Each character has a different color tone, matching the personality and feelings of the actor/actresses.All in all, a great movie.""End of Story!""",High Society
121,Sam-62,One of the best musicals made,10,27 September 1998,"High Society is one of my favorite musicals of all time, the music is great the actors and actresses are perfect and excellent in this movie.  Not only is the music great but the story and dialogue is witty, clever and entertaining I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes musicals.",High Society
122,NF09,The musical re-make of The Philadelphia Story,10,6 May 2005,"High Society is a terrific film. If you are the type of movie fan who doesn't comprehend the ENTERTAIN part of entertainment and is eager and willing to flaunt that ignorance in film reviews, you will hate it. But if you don't mind it when movies may not end up with deep psychological messages or everybody dead or doomed to a life of misery, you'll agree.I'm the first to admit that this musical may not be DRAMATICALLY up to standard with The Philadelpia Story, but what musical could be, or should be, for that matter. The cast, however, is another thing entirely. As you probably know, the first cast was nearly incomparable. Suave and tremendously charming Cary Grant, the magnificent Katherine Hepburn, and, of course, Jimmy, who won an Oscar for his work and is never less than adorable.NEARLY incomparable.But if anyone can do it, it's gotta be Bing,Satchmo,Gracie,and the Voice. I find it hard to believe anyone in the world could possibly contest that, but since there are such unlikely specimens out there, I'd better explain. If there's a more magnificent marriage than that of Frank Sinatra and a Cole Porter masterpiece, I'd like to hear about it. But even perfection can be improved, when you add Bing Crosby, a witty little tune,and some hilarious ad libs, all courtesy of a few too many drinks.That makes up heaven, which can also go under the heading of '' Well, Did you Evah,'' without a doubt the best song ,and scene, in this film. But never fear, there are other gems as well.Grace Kelly is terrific in High Society. The not quite yet Princess of Monaco is not only breathtakingly beautiful, but adorable as well. Her drunken warbling of ''You're Sensational,'' as her stiffly embarrassed fiancé drags her through a crowd of very proper guests is hilarious, and I can never keep from laughing during the scene when she meets Mike Connor and Liz Embrie, also known as Frank Sinatra and Celeste Holm. Louis Armstrong doesn't have much to do in the picture, but what he does do is great. He introduces the film with a cute calypso number, sings a marvelous duet with Bing, and the way he say's,'' End of song, beginin' of the storyyy,'' is enough to make him unforgettable.Bing, of course, can NEVER be anything but magnificent. He remains an American icon, and all his talent, charm, and timeless quality are well displayed.He makes his easy-going way through some magical songs,too, including, two marvelous duets with his singing co-stars, and, of course, that little #1 record he did with Grace.Personally, I like Celeste Holm even more in High Society than I liked Ruth Hussey,who played the Liz Embrie role in Philadelphia Story.She's funny, charming,works well with Sinatra, sings a hilarious duet with The Voice, and has a beautiful smile. ( Not that the last thing mentioned matters, but it helps.)And now-the best for last. I have been a Sinatra adorer for years, so I'm more than a little biased, but I absolutely love Mr.Sinatra in this movie. His singing is flawless and incomparable, ( especially in ''You're Sensational,'') his charm and charisma even more evident than the considerable amount displayed by Mr.Crosby, and he's pure style and ring-a-ding ding.( Those blue eyes ain't bad either!) Oh, one complaint I've found about High Society is that it's outdated and it aged badly. I am 14 years old, so, if there WERE any reason to believe that, I'd be one of the first to know it. It is NOT outdated, has NOT aged badly, and it's one of the most entertaining and simply fun movies I've ever seen. And that is, as Satchmo says, the...'' End of storyyy!!''",High Society
123,yonahred,mediocre remake of a great movie,5,1 March 2003,"The Philadelphia Story with Jimmy Stewart, Cary Grant and Kate Hepburn was made in 1940 and this remake replaced those superstars with the minor lights of Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby and Grace Kelly.  Of the three Grace is the best, but that's not saying much, for Sinatra and Crosby are totally insufficient to the roles assigned to them.  Music in the form of songs and the presence of Louis Armstrong and jazz is added to little affect except as a distraction to the pale imitation of a great original.",High Society

Bing Crosby coasts in his affable style and is well cast as the easy-going C. Dexter Haven. Frank Sinatra is a good foil both in vocal and acting style as he brings slightly more bite to his part. However Grace Kelly is the cynosure of all eyes (and all male attention) in the film, as she was never more beautiful. The comic songs ""Who wants to be a millionaire"" and ""Well did you evah"" are great fun and the highlights of the film. All the songs are pleasant, although perhaps uneven in quality compared for example with Cole Porter's ""Kiss me Kate"" of several years before. One of the pleasures of the film, particularly with repeat viewing on DVD, is checking out the luxurious indoor and outdoor settings and lovely costumes. Even with slightly faded colour, it's all very classy. An enjoyable way to spend 111 minutes  a good one to add to your collection.",High Society

128,wheelsdude,Watch the movie for more than the story!,8,27 October 2006,"I just read a review of this movie that said that the movie was great performances, great songs and duets, and great fun. Then they went on to say that the movie lacked in script strength, and they gave the movie a 5 or 6. Preposterous! This movie is a great movie not because of the story, but because of all the all star cast members and the amazing song selection created by Cole Porter. Yeah, the movie does have its fair share of cheesy lines, but it has some memorable ones as well (""Right song, wrong girl."" is one that comes to mind). To see this movie for how great it is, you have to see past the script and watch it for the entertainment value. Now this might be hard for some, since the script is the body of the movie, but the performances and the music are what make this movie so great that if you truly immerse yourself in this movie, then you won't even notice some of the flaws in the story. Now I know that the argument that the movie is great because of the all star cast is one that does not have much merit, because there have been a few films that have had the all star cast, yet have failed to live up to expectations. So how is this movie different, you may ask. It is different because it was one of the first, if not THE FIRST movie, to have such combined star power in a single film. The sheer star talent (Sinatra, Kelly, Crosby, Armstrong and the supporting cast) is enough to give anyone a reason to watch this film. So don't watch this movie to critique the script and get all analytical about the plot, this is a movie that was made for sheer entertainment value, and it should be viewed in that way.",High Society

131,ishaand,"Cheap, inferior knockoff redeemed somewhat by the music",4,4 July 2004,"First off, ""High Society"" (HS) is a musical ""remake"" of the classic ""The Philadelphia Story"" (TPS) (1940, Cary Grant, Kate Hepburn & Jimmy Stewart). It is vastly inferior to the original.I have not read the original 1938 play upon which the Philadelphia Story was based, but High Society lifts most of its dialogue (and therefore, scenes) lock, stock and barrel from Donald Ogden Stewart's TPS script. Since both movies have a very similar running time (~110 min), and since HS crams about 30 min of music (as well as a useless ~5 min no-video overture) into itself, the plot must suffer.Because of the time constraint, HS ditches some aspects (mostly the funny parts in the beginning) of the TPS plot, and skimps on the others (notably, the tender scenes between Tracy & Dexter towards the end). This might make the end look a bit silly to those not acquainted with the original story.Seeing Kelly & Co. mouth verbatim the lines of the classic actors of TPS in itself seems despicable. Put in additional plot holes, and this is an incoherent mash. The redeeming quality, o course, is the cause of all this incoherence: the music. HS has the classic Crosby/Armstrong ""Now You Has Jazz"", and the other tunes are quite listenable too, such as ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire"" and the Sinatra/Crosby ""What A Swell Party This Is"".Kelly plays the part of the Ice Queen well in the beginning, but her return of affection for Dexter is thoroughly unbelievable. Both Crosby and Sinatra seem smug throughout the proceedings, and only seem to come into their own during the song sequences.All in all, fans of the original will want to stay away from High Society.

Given the talent in front of and behind the camera something must have gone awry. Charles Walters was no hack director and made some of the most successful comedy films of the era. But the whole thing looks lifeless and flat. You will notice that the film is shot in VistaVision, notable for its wide angle lenses. This widescreen process had been used many times at Paramount, where it was invented,and a great devotee was Alfred Hitchcock. However it was a first for MGM and I think there was a conscious decision, wrongly as it turned out, to eschew the normal medium shots and close ups and keep it wide.

Here are three (Bing, Frank and Grace) at the height of their powers, giving great performances.Bing steals the show - just - but there isn't a dull moment.

What amazing and deep talent.I caught it in HD (thanks to my DVR) and it is a beautiful transfer, crystal clear and detailed almost to a fault.

They do team up for a few good songs, but their best moments are solo.Grace Kelly shows her ""Ice Princess"" persona at first, but uses her acting skill to convince us that she's just the girl next door after all. It was after seeing this movie that I fell in love with Grace.
