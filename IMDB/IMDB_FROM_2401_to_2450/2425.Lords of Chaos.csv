0,Leofwine_draca,Darker and darker,6,23 August 2021,"LORDS OF CHAOS (2018) is a Scandi film looking at the growth of Norwegian 'black metal' music in the early 1990s, particularly focusing on the rise of one band composed of misadjusted individuals who ended up making the news in a very big way. I should note that I'm no fan of this kind of music at all, but nonetheless this is a decent little biopic that veers between drama/thriller/horror quite evenly. Rory Culkin is a good choice and looks the part for the lead and it's one of those films that gradually gets darker and darker as it progresses, with the characters and their behaviour getting out of hand and some truly brutal moments taking place later on. An uncomfortable watch at times, but far more challenging than many of the 'safe' biopics that Hollywood churn out these days.",Lords of Chaos
1,nogodnomasters,You just copied Venom,6,7 July 2019,"The movie opens with a disclaimer which claims that some of the feature is ""lies."" This is the story of the Norwegian Black Metal band called ""Mayhem"" as told through its founder Euronymous (Rory Culkin). Their antics with the addition of Varg (Emory Cohen) made Ozzy look like a sissy boy scout. As the band goes off the edge of the societal norm it becomes even too much for Euronymous who like Trump, takes credit for everything.To me, the band sounded like any other Death Metal band and was not one of my favorites. The story was interesting, even if inaccurate.Guide: F-word, sex, nudity (Sky Ferreira + others)",Lords of Chaos
2,kosmasp,Alone at ...,9,10 May 2019,"... the center of Chaos? If the main actor seems familiar, it might be because you know his brother from the Kevin movies (Home Alone). But Rory tries to make a name of his own and with a performance like this, he's on a good way to achieve just that.Also very bold choice to go with a dark (true) story like that. I don't know all the details of what happened in real life (guessing they heightened a few things as they tend to do in movies), but that does not take anything away from the impact and power of the movie. This really is violent and touches subject matters that make it difficult to really feel sympathy for most of the characters. If you can detach that despicable side and see this as an interesting movie, it will entice you. That does not mean you are condoning or endorsing any of what the characters decide to do. Then again some will love the ""anarchy"" of it all - but that is in the eye of the beholder",Lords of Chaos
3,paul_haakonsen,Tacky and tasteless? Or a narrative well told based on tragic events?...,7,13 August 2020,"Well, as a listener of metal for more than 30+ years, of course the tragic story of of Dead, Euronymous, Varg and the other people involved in the events that shook a nation in the early 1990s wasn't exactly unfamiliar territory to me. However, I wasn't aware that they had actually turned it into a movie. It was by sheer random luck that I happened to come across the 2018 movie from director Jonas Åkerlund here in 2020. And of course, this was a movie that I had to sit down and watch.First of all, I have to say that I don't understand why director Jonas Åkerlund opted to go for an English speaking direction of the movie. It just took away so much authenticity from the movie that everyone were speaking English and the fact that most of them weren't even Norwegian or Swedish actors. That was a shame, because had it been in Norwegian and with a native Norwegian and Swedish cast, this would have been so much more impacting.And also I happened to cringe when I saw that the movie was fronted by Rory Culkin. A Culkin in a movie such as this; surely that seemed like an atrocity in its own. But I was put to shame, because Rory Culkin walked tall and carried the movie phenomenally with his performance. I was more than genuinely surprised with how he handled this performance, it was just spectacular. Color me more than impressed with Rory Culkin in this movie.Now, the story told in ""Lords of Chaos"" is a brutal story that is based on true events, real people and actual happenings. Which just makes it all the more hard-hitting. So the movie might not just be suitable for just anyone in the audience.The narrative drive in the storyline was good, and while the movie ran for about two hours, it never really felt slow or uneventful. And that was a great accomplishment for director Jonas Åkerlund. However, one might debate whether or not a story as tragic and, well outright insane, as the story was is suitable entertainment for a movie. But, of course, that boils down to a matter of preference. Personally, I think the narrative was delivered quite well, and the story was presented in a very acceptable and fulfilling manner.The movie also offers some insight into the early beginning of the black metal scene, and also delves into the elements of Euronymous's talents in terms of running a record store and a music label.Whether or not you are interested in Norwegian black metal, the tragedy that struck Mayhem and the black metal community, then ""Lords of Chaos"" is a movie that definitely is noteworthy, because it has such a powerful punch to it. Definitely a movie that is well-worth taking the time and effort to sit down and watch. Just a shame that they didn't go for authenticity in terms of language and performers.I was more than adequately entertained by this 2018 movie, and my rating is a seven out of ten stars.",Lords of Chaos
4,BandSAboutMovies,Until the Light Takes Our Laughtrack,2,12 March 2019,"I've always felt that the black metal scene of the early 1990's is hard to explain. The music that emerged from it is pretty much timeless, but in order to enjoy it, you need to either embrace or get past a lot of things. And by things, that word seems pretty light. Those things are murder and arson just for a start.Based on the book Lords of Chaos: The Bloody Rise of the Satanic Metal Underground by Michael Moynihan and Didrik Søderlind, this Jonas Akerlund directed film falls prey to some of the issues that book has. Namely, who can know exactly what was going on in the scene unless they were there? Varg Vikernes - who recorded as Burzum and appears as one of the main characters in both the book and movie - has been a major critic. Vikernes states that the authors of the book had no insight or knowledge of what Black Metal was and they still filled the heads of a generation of metal fans with lies.He hasn't gone light on this film either. In a series of YouTube videos, he's denied the filmmakers the rights to his music. He wasn't pleased at being presented as being power mad. He's also claimed that the movie is made up and plain wrong. Then again, this is the guy who murdered the other main character in this movie. So, like I said, black metal has a lot to get past if you're going to go any deeper.
The film begins when Euronymous (Rory Culkin, Signs) forms Mayhem with Necrobutcher, Manheim and Maniac, but soon the last two members leave and are replaced by drummer Hellhammer (Anthony De La Torre, who played young Jack Sparrow in Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales) and Dead, a singer who was once killed for several seconds by bullies in grade school. As a result, he has become defined by death, sending his vocal audition to the band along with a crucified mouse.Mayhem soon becomes big within the metal scene, playing shows where Dead cuts himself and throws pig heads at audience members. As Metalion - a journalist who created the Slayer Mag that would document the scene (you can grab the collected issues from Bazillion Points) - films a show, the band meets a fan named Varg Vikernes, who is initially made fun of by the band.Meanwhile, Dead decides to slice up his body and use Euronymous' shotgun to commit suicide. Instead of calling the police right away, he takes photos of the body and takes pieces of Dead's skull fragments to make necklaces. This causes Hellhammer to leave the band.Euronymous then opens a record shop called Helvete that becomes the social center of the scene, drawing people like Varg, Darkthrone's Fenriz and Emperor's Faust (Valter Skarsgard) into becoming the Black Circle. Euronymous' ego is threatened by Varg's growing popularity - particularly amongst women - and willingness to live up to the anti-Christian rants and do things for real.It becomes a battle of who is in control of the Black Circle. While Euronymous can lay claim to creating true Norweigan black metal, Varg has been the one willing to actually burn down churches and incite others like Faust to commit murder. While all this is going on, a new version of Mayhem that features Euronymous, Varg, Blackthorn and Attila record ""De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas.""Helvete is soon shut down by the police and Varg is arrested as the prime suspect of the church burnings after he does an interview with a newspaper claiming he committed every crime. That said, Euronymous does the same in a Kerrang! article. Varg is arrested but soon released for lack of evidence. And after an argument over who was in charge of the scene and what true black metal means, the two men reach the point of no return. To Euronymous, everything he said was just promotion. To Varg, selling records is meaningless next to his cause and his former mentor is now seen as fake.That's when Euronymous starts telling stories about how he's going to kill Varg and make a snuff movie out of it. To him, this was all probably just talk. To Varg, these threats are real. So on the morning of August 10, he goes to Euronymous' apartment and kills him. The knife stabbing extends on and on, probably like it did in real life. Varg would go on to serve the maximum sentence of 21 years in jail, which he served, despite escaping once.So what did other people from the scene think? Mayhem's Attila spoke for the current band members, saying that their position regarding the film and its creators is a ""big CENSORED you."" He also pointed out that the movie only focused on Mayhem during the 1990s, not the whole black metal scene. That said, he did allow some of Tormentor's songs to be used in the film and his role is played by his son, Arion Csihar. He was also on set for the church burning scenes.Mayhem's founding bassist Necrobutcher said, ""I will do everything I can to stop this film. Tell the Swedes and the Hollywood people to go CENSORED themselves."" That said, the director claims that he got the band's support. Their actual music doesn't appear in the film. Instead, the songs were re-recorded by Malparidos re-recorded their songs for the picture.So how did I feel? I hated this movie from three minutes in. Its tone feels like it wants to be a comedic tour through the formation of Mayhem and the fun - such as it is - of the scene. Let's keep in mind how strange it is to portray many of these events - like church burnings - as buddy buddy moments. I didn't believe in anyone in the film, didn't see them as these near-mythic people they are portraying. Maybe that was the intention, to show us that the true Black Circle was just a bunch of silly kids acting up. But it just feels false. And false is at the very heart of everything that black metal stood against, demanding truth and devotion to a cause, no matter how patently insane it could be. I'd compare it to gangster rap, another genre that demanded that artists live up to the lyrics they recorded.There's nothing here that answers why one of the most gorgeous places in existence could give root to one of the darkest sub-genres in music. I guess I shouldn't expect that much from a movie. But with Akerlund having some knowledge of this scene - he was in Bathory, which predates this era - but this all rang as false as the black metal band in Rob Zombie's Lords of Salem.If this is your first exposure to this music, there's no way you're going to want to listen to it or enjoy it. Even the end, where Euronymous tells the audience to CENSORED off and proclaims that he invented true Norweigan black metal, feels fake. It sounds like words on a page, not something proudly proclaimed. For all the faults of this film, that's the worst. And when its followed up by cartoony fun images of church burnings and devils, it's just upsetting.This could have been so much more. Instead, it's worse than nothing.",Lords of Chaos
5,FeastMode,my notes,3,27 July 2019,"Was into it for a while, slowly started losing me, and became garbo. didn't care by the end. another based-on-a-true-story that i view as a useless movie (1 viewing)",Lords of Chaos
6,jack_o_hasanov_imdb,It could have been a better movie,7,28 August 2021,"It could have been a better movie.But it was good to see a serious movie about metal.I knew about ""Mayhem"" and the events that had happened. But Norwegian black is not my preferred genre, even if I'm a metalhead. It was an average movie.",Lords of Chaos
7,UniqueParticle,Morbidly evil horror music mix,9,15 August 2019,"I'll start by saying I am barely a metal fan but this is awesome and I absolutely love things about mayhem/darkness! I love Emory Cohen and Rory Culkin in just about everything so I think they're perfect for this sinister story. This has so many levels of disturbing and effed up parts so that's important to know! No one and I mean it under 18 should ever should see this unless they can handle it.I absolutely love the way the main characters celebrate I won't spoil but definitely one of the most evil things you could ever do on earth, like entirely satanic! I would've given it a 10 if it wasn't for the overdoing it last 15 minutes, rubbed me the wrong way, otherwise spectacular film!",Lords of Chaos
8,damianphelps,Lords Of Entertainment,8,22 September 2021,"Rory Culkin is 100% this movie, without him the story would fail to reach any real heights.Any previous knowledge of Mayhem is not a prerequisite to watching or enjoying the movie. Culkin's Character is mostly pathetic bordering on desperate and his performance really connects the audience with those elements.Totally worth watching :)",Lords of Chaos
9,videorama-759-859391,"Chaotically, refreshingly original",9,31 July 2019,"I wasn't expecting to like this great, movie as much as I did. I didn't really know what to expect, to a great extent. LOC is a very engaging, if compelling film about a bunch of true blue black metal rockers, Norweigan ones, who founded the band Mayham, fanatics who cause it too, in little old Oslo, that had me recollecting, that nut who shot 177 people back in 2011 who was from there. It is a very well acted with with some disturbing themes, one involving a candid suicide, another scene involving a random and bloody murder, and in the end, a most grisly one of betrayal. LOC rocks on all levels, confrontingly violent, well scripted, and again, bloody well acted, Jack Kilmer's (son of Val) short lived role, is hauntingly brilliant. Culkin, who we can't forget here, is bloody impressive too,
his performance, holding a lot of weight, and he likes kebabs too. But it's the unhinged Varg, played superbly by Emory Cohen, that stayed with me. There were so powerful moments, involving him, that truly unnerved me. He is a great acting force to be reckoned with. This is a important film, one that rocks, with a so tragic, a terrifyingly violent ending. The violence is a thing that gets you in this overly violent film. In ill respect, the film is very funny too, and the music is tragically suited. Another 2019 film, and like The House That Jack Built, shouldn't be overlooked. You won't be disappointed.",Lords of Chaos
10,jtindahouse,Not afraid to be bold and different and the results are excellent,9,14 May 2019,"For my mind films like 'Lords of Chaos' are the way of the future. By that I mean films that aren't afraid to push boundaries. Films that aren't afraid to be bold and daring and challenge their audience. Why? Because they are the only films that actually stand out and are memorable any more. So many films today follow a formula, play it safe, and are consequently instantly forgotten. 'Lords of Chaos' is not one of those films.I pride myself on handling extreme violence in films very well, but there were a couple of scene in this film that tested even my stomach. Really really powerful imagery that is hard to get out of your mind afterwards. But this film has more tricks up its sleeve than just shocking you. It is based on an extremely interesting true story (which makes everything you see that much more shocking). The story was done in a way that kept the movie moving at a brisk pace and always had you needing to know what was going to happen next.I was also a big fan of the choice to use Amercian actors with American accents in a film based in Norway. That's a much better route to go down than the mess that was David Fincher's 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' where every actor seemed to go in their own direction. 'Lords of Chaos' is an extremely dark film that may not be to everyone's liking. However if you think you're game enough to handle it, then I think you're going to have a very good time with this one.",Lords of Chaos
11,jadavix,Recommended,7,7 March 2020,"""Lords of Chaos"" is better than I expected. Jonas Akerlund in the past seemed like a typical music video brat-cum feature filmmaker; ie. his movies were full of gimmicky rubbish effects like ""Spun"" that works to get the attention of audiences of five minute video clips, but just gets tiresome with a full-length movie. I liked ""Small Apartments"", though.""Lords of Chaos"" shows that Akerlund has become a capable filmmaker. They say directors become great not by adding, but by taking away, and this one feels gritty and realistic due to the restrained approach he has employed. It doesn't feel like he gets in the way of the actors, which is to the film's benefit, as Rory Culkin is great as Euronymous.The movie is also, surprisingly, funny. It's not afraid to point out the ridiculousness of this story. These oh-so-evil black metallers were part of some kind of Satanic cult that was bent on taking over the world... and they had to hide the flowers their parents sent them when their pals came over because they weren't evil enough. Sure, they burnt down some churches and even killed a guy, but when Varg went public with this in an interview, turning the lights down, hanging his beloved Swastika on the wall, the reporter almost walked out of the interview, not taking the man seriously - and who could blame him?The movie culminates in one of the most brutal murder scenes I have seen in a film. This is not a spoiler - you already knew that was how it was going to end. This scene must set some kind of record for the number of stab wounds in a movie scene.I do have a big problem with the movie, though. And that is the character of Ann-Marit. You knew a movie made in the new millennium telling a story which was really entirely about men couldn't be told without the introduction of a Strong Female Character (TM). You know, the female voice of reason, the only one who understands the poor foolish man, the one he never could have succeeded without, the one he should have listened to.Only problem with all that garbage is the fact that of course, the character never existed. One could even argue that she couldn't exist. What is such a Strong Female (TM) doing hanging out with a bunch of losers like Mayhem? She had to know they were heading for prison time, at least. The only women attracted to these guys would have been the idiots Varg is shown ploughing through.It's so lame that every movie has to introduce this lame stock character. With all the other restraint the movie showed, I wish they'd followed through and left her out. Her role is thankfully rather negligible, still allowing the movie to shine.Lastly, you have to agree that it deserved an honorary Oscar just for casting a Jewish actor in the role of that boring pretend-Nazi puts, Kristian ""Varg"" Vikernes. If it made him mad (and it did) you can't deny that's a plus.",Lords of Chaos
12,drownnnsoda,"Decent, if not predictable biopic",7,8 May 2020,"""Lords of Chaos"" follows the rise of black metal in Norway in the late 1980s and early 1990s, focusing on Mayhem founder Euronymous and his peers, Varg. What begins as a musical movement soon spirals into a crime spree of church burning and murder.As someone with no familiarity with this story, I was curious as to where this film was going to go, and it more or less ended up where I thought it would. Broadly speaking, it is a tale as old as time: The protege seeks power, and the protege ultimately eats the leader. It's a common narrative in life and fiction. In that way, there are few surprises in this film, even for those uninitiated with the true story it is based upon.The backlash against the film largely seems to come from the adherents to the black metal scene, who have dismissed it as mere fiction, and/or for cartoonizing their scene. The truth is that the film is probably closer to the center than its detractors are willing to admit, though it does ultimately read as a tribute to Euronymous. The reality is that, no matter which way a biopic is undertaken, it is never going to be pure truth. None of us were there, and only those who were know what happened. I am sure the film takes liberties and makes broad strokes, but so far as the criminal elements are concerned, it seems the screenplay sticks close to the truth.Jonas Akerland, a music video director who impressed many of us with his hyperreal meth-binge odyssey ""Spun"" in 2004, brings his quick-witted, flashy aesthetic to this film as well, which at times feels out of place, but in general, the film is well-paced and very nicely shot. The lead performances are solid, with Rory Culkin playing the Euronymous character with an emotional spin, and Emory Cohen as Varg Vikernes, desperate to carry the scene's musical and visual aesthetic into the realm of political revolt-by-murder and mayhem. Sky Ferreira appears as Euronymous's love interest, playing a fictionalized token girlfriend part. The film is loaded with a number of extremely disturbing scenes that are laid out in all their gory details.In the end, ""Lords of Chaos"" is an unsurprising biopic, but it does offer a number of intense moments and visuals, and performances that are generally solid. By the end of it all, I was mostly struck by the film's ability to walk the line between tongue-in-cheek criticism and absolute nihilism--which is, probably unironically, the goal. Most of all, though, the film rings as a depressing look into aimless youth desperate to make identities for themselves at lethal--and ultimately, pointless--costs. 7/10.",Lords of Chaos
13,Pairic,The Birth Of Death Metal,8,3 April 2019,"Lords Of Chaos: When Death Metal wasn't enough, Black Metal burst forth from The Brow Of Satan! Well it really came from the attic of a middle class Norwegian family home where spoiled son Euronymous (Rory Culkin) practices with his band Mayhem. Determined to outrage he adopts Satanic motifs and refers to Death Metal as Life Metal. An applicant for lead singer, Dead (Jack Kilmer) sends in a crucified mouse along with a demo tape. Dead cuts himself on stage and throws pigs heads into the audience at gigs. He collects roadkill and hates cats, even hanging them in his bedroom. His suicide is used by Euronymous to further publicise Mayhem.Euronymous is very much a mouth th though, doing outrageous things, but always to advance his profile. Along comes Varg (Emory Cohen) a talented singer and musician. Varg however is genuine in his deranged beliefs which form a synthesis of Satanism, Paganism and Nazi Ideology, his attitude to his enemies is to: ""gas them in the showers"". He resorts to church burning to promote his new album and thus begins a circle of real mayhem and violence.Dead, Varg and their circle (The Black Circle) meet in the basement of Dead's record store but even this venture is funded by Dead's parents and the launch of Varg's first album is funded by his mother. They never really broke the links with the society they professed to despise and supposedly wished to destroy. The difference between Dead and Varg becomes more obvious as Varg's extreme stunts head off the scale. They battle for supremacy within The Black Circle but the victory of Varg could lead to the end of everything for them.Some really disturbing scenes of animal abuse (undoubtedly faked) which the vast majority of Death/Black/Heavy Metal, Hardcore and Punk fans would not approve of. And this is the only audience which would truly understand Lords Of Chaos. SCenes of burning churches will also disturb many, especially seeing as they were mostly old wood chapels, works of historical, even archaeological significance. But well filmed scenes nevertheless and one of them had been built on the site of an Altar of Odin, so few tears on my part for that one.A film about what transpires when fantasy meets reality. Director and writer Jonas Åkerlund has delivered a powerful but disturbing film about the birth of Black Metal. 8/10.",Lords of Chaos
14,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Crazy Take on Real Events,8,26 February 2019,"This was a film I was interested in for the fact that I heard a podcast about the events this is based off. The film even starts stating this is based on truth, lies and what really happened. The official synopsis is a teenager's quest to launch Norwegian Black Metal in Oslo in the early 1990's results in a very violent outcome.Euronymous (Rory Culkin) is our main character and he narrates to start off us off. We will also get this periodically throughout the film. He lives in a normal, middle class family, but he is the black sheep of his family, being that he is into metal. He is against that his country is a monarchy and that it is deeply religious. He is in a metal band named Mayhem, but they need a singer. He is reached out to by Pelle 'Dead' Olmin (Jack Kilmer). After hearing him, he knows he's perfect.Together, they get a house in the middle of nowhere. Dead shows Euronymous how to do his make-up as they prepare for their first show. They go out and have promotional shoot as well. We see that Dead is quite unstable though, as he is severely depressed. Things take a turn as he kills himself. Euronymous finds him and instead of calling for help, gets a camera to take pictures. He also makes the surviving band members necklaces made of his skull.From here he meets Kristian 'Varg' Vikernes (Emory Cohen). He turns out to be a poser and Euronymous mocks him. Euronymous with his band has put the genre of Norwegian Black Metal on the map. He has his own label and record store, with the help of his father. There's a room in the basement for those that really embrace the lifestyle and it's called the Black Circle. Varg comes back and brings a tape of his band. Euronymous hears it and is intrigued.Things start to get out of hand though when Varg burns a church down. He tells Euronymous that those that really embrace the lifestyle need to make things happen. Euronymous takes credit for him doing it though, stating he said to take action and he did. There are other things that escalate even more and things get out of hand. We also see how scary Varg really is.What is really intriguing about this is that everything that happens is based on true events. Now I've never read the book that details all of this. I have listen to a podcast that didn't go as in depth, but there were quite a few things I remembered as watching this film play out. I have to say that this is pretty interesting, especially someone that is a former juggalo, because I definitely saw myself in this film.I really want to delve into that for this review. When I was in junior high, I was really into the band the Insane Clown Posse and others on their label of the Psychopathic Family. This in turn got me into neumetal as well. I actually was still an honors student and actually played sports, despite me being into these dark groups and saying that I followed a lot of things they were for. In the end though, I was just a poser trying to be different, but needing a place. Now as an adult, I look back and think its funny, because in my group of friends, I'm the horror expert. I can still be into these things without dressing a certain way and just being me. The issue though we see in this film is that some of them are a bit insane.What I mean by this, Euronymous is kind of a tool. Everything that happens, he takes credit for, but he really doesn't do anything. Any type of crime that is committed by his friends, he tells them he inspired them to do it. On the other side though, Varg really has issues. He embraces this lifestyle, but he is a psychopath. The same could really be said about Bård Guldvik 'Faust' Eithun (Valter Skarsgård). He goes way too far and we see that he is into horror films, but I don't think that's what caused him to do what he did. Varg is just a scary and intimidating presence.I do have to say that I like how this film is paced. Being that is a based on a true story, I'm sure that things are changed and cutout to ensure that it flows like a film should. Real life doesn't always work out that way. With what was put into this film was good and it really built the tension. I felt myself getting more and more worried as things continue to escalate, until they come to a head with the conclusion. I wouldn't say that the ending is really satisfying, but it is sad that is what it came to. It had me hooked from the beginning though, I will give it that.Acting for the film was really good across the board. Culkin I thought was great as the lead here. He has a look of not being all that bad looking and just fitting the character very well. He brings arrogance, even though he shouldn't. He is smart enough to make himself the center of things that he shouldn't, but he's also weak and this gets him into trouble. Cohen was great as a weak person who grows into such a psychopath. With things he does, he just becomes scarier and scarier as he grows. I did feel bad for him in the beginning though when he's mocked. I thought Kilmer, Skarsgård, Anthony De La Torre and the rest of the Goths in the film were good as well. I also wanted to shout out to Sky Ferreira. I liked her role and seeing her nude wasn't half bad either. The rest of the cast round out the film for what was needed.Something that really blew me away in this film was the effects. Seeing Dead on stage and him cutting himself looked so real. It made me cringe. They seem to do all of the effects practically and it is a great move, as it really does look real. The film is also shot beautifully. There is a bit of realism where we see film recorded on a video camera, which is inline with the time period.Finally this brings me to the score of the film, which if you haven't guessed is full of metal music. It really isn't necessarily my genre, but it fits perfectly for the film. I did catch myself kind of bobbing my head to the music, so if you can get any kind of reaction out of me, I definitely think it works for the film.Now I have to say, this film is actually pretty interesting. I will admit that I don't know the entire story to this, but I think this film constructed it in a way that was interesting. It is crazy that this really happened though. The acting was really good in my opinion and I thought they constructed the story in such a way that the tension continues to build. The effects looked amazing and the score of the film is fitting for this film. Now I have heard this film has been pretty polarizing so far, but I really did enjoy it. I don't think this is a great film, but it is definitely interesting and was good in my opinion. I'd recommend checking this out.",Lords of Chaos
15,robertemerald,"Visually really good, but disappointing soundtrack",7,19 January 2020,"Do you need to be a fan of black metal to enjoy Lords of Chaos? Not really, but it helps. Oddly no song seemed to be played the whole way through, a blessing for those not into metal. Beyond the actual band songs the soundtrack was a little ordinary. The shortfall is made up for by some stunning imagery. The filmmakers can be proud of their visual contribution, which, after a slow start, is sustained throughout. Outside of the metal this is pretty much a teen thriller, with all the parties, drinking, obnoxious behaviour and young love you'd expect from any teen movie, but very little tension. What takes the movie up a notch is the charisma of the lead (easily the best actor) and the fact that he is also narrating. It is the lead that keeps this movie above water. I wouldn't say the script is brilliant, but certainly the time given to Euronymous is excellent. There is one surprise, but it hardly rocks the boat, so to speak. It's hard to comment on the plot as much of the story may be true, but if it is true you may be disillusioned by the emotional primitiveness and unconcern of members of this black circle, something that argues against it being true rather than for. Still, it works as a theme, and I believe there is a documentary if you find it fascinating.",Lords of Chaos

This film directed by Jonas Åkerlund (former drummer in proto Black Metallers Bathory) is based on the 1998 book of the same name, and stars Rory Culkin as Euronymous and Emory Cohen as his arch rival Varg Vikernes (aka Count Grishnackh). Jack Kilmer shines as Dead, the original singer of Mayhem who committed suicide, and received praise for his portrayal despite the real Dead never actually killing any cats like he does here. Åkerlund was granted unprecedented access to police reports as well as photographs of Euronymous's record store Helvete and the house the band lived in, but was denied the rights to using the music of Vikernes by the man himself due to his criticism of the source material.

23,Stay_away_from_the_Metropol,Uffda,4,18 February 2019,"Wanted to like this movie but I really did not at all.First of all, the inconsistent tone is a bummer. For the first 20 minutes, it feels like a black metal Detroit Rock City (I love that movie) and it's a lot of fun. Then, the majority of the movie shifts to what attempts to be a lot more serious, but really only exists as an extremely redundant and empty display of only the most surface level elements of black metal origins, while completely lacking any sort of depth, character development, or creativity. The lack of nuance was actually mind-numbing... I don't know how you could write a script this vapid and feel okay with it.I would call the writing abominable. There is a complete lack of persona due to this, and most of the characters are hardly given enough to form personalities with, aside from Varg. The performances are also primarily wooden and empty as a damn trash can after the garbage man came. Culkin is a lot of fun to look at when he's done up that way, but his performance fails to deliver any sort of emotional resonance when it feels like under the circumstances it should contain some. Varg's character is effectively despicable as the events that occur leave you with no other choice, but Emery Cohan's portrayal is not sellable. There had to have been a bit more evil he could have pulled from something deep within him. When any of these dudes try to deliver lines like ""HAIL SATAN"" or ""Let's burn the churches. All of them"" it all sounds like a complete joke, a mockery. They're supposed to mean it! There were only two solid performances in the film, and that was coming from Sky Ferreira who seems to just be acting as she would in reality, but it works well - it's charming and feels sincere, and from this Scandinavian journalist dude.There were two strong scenes towards the end of the movie but it wasn't enough to save the movie: a sequence where the aforementioned journalist is interviewing Varg about the church burning and murders, which works very well in a dryly comedic sense.... and of course, a rather violent finale... RATHER violent, which is the only scene that does manage to conjure up a bit of sadness and/or chills-through-brutality. These scenes were well done, but the rest of the movie did not sit well with me.Soundtrack is mostly unfitting and overly pretty considering the subject matter. It really should have just been strict black metal - there's NO reason for it not to be. Editing and pacing is typical Jonas Ackerlund tomfoolery - calm down and tell us a story please. This is the main reason why I disliked SPUN, regardless of the fact that it's about tweakers... it still doesn't make for an enjoyable viewing.This movie would have fared way better as either a strict comedy, or a full-on drama that stayed true to the morbid tone of everything black metal has always been about. The hybrid does not work in this case. I think it goes without saying that it would have benefitted from some Norse accents as well! UFFDA.",Lords of Chaos

25,jamiedarlow-37510,Brutal and harsh,6,22 June 2020,"Director Jonas Akerlund's envisioning of a brutal and morbid real life story is well worth a watch for any fan of extreme cinema or the black metal band Mayhem that is at the centre of the story. Focusing on the beginnings of the band in 1987 and founding member Euronomous is dedicated to putting together the greatest black metal band of all time. Plenty of controversial publicity stunts and anarchy ensues; creating a beast even Euronomous didn't expect; the man behind 'Burzum'. Its graphic content is certainly something that'll linger in the mind for a while after; particularly as it's all portraying actual events. There's a certain scene that captures in high detail a man slowly committing gory suicide which is really jarring and upsetting to watch. The characters are all not people you'd want to spend any time with and it's kudos to the film that it manages to still be watchable and at times engaging with this aspect. Rory Culkin is really great as Euronomous; your sympathies are tested at times but all surprisingly redeemed through the running time. Overall, a pretty decent depiction of a really dark chapter in music history but, as stated in an interview with Mayhem themselves, a painful reminder of the sadness in their past",Lords of Chaos
26,Donatien3,Brutal Retelling of True Black Metal Legends,9,11 March 2019,"While 'Lords of Choas' - a retelling of the controversial early years of Norwegian Black Metal band Mayhem - features Rory Culkin (Macauley's brother) and American accents, it's not some Hollywood-ised sell out that washes over the worst part.LOC features self-mutilation, suicide - Pelle ""Dead"" Ohlin's death (Jack Kilmer) is quite graphic - murder, lots of blood and gore, sex, swearing and mild animal cruelty (Dead and Euronymous shooting at an innocent cat in the woods). There's a lot of brutal, raw black metal, but it serves as a background to the story (compared to 'Bohemian Rhapsody', which was criticised for washing over Freddy's more controversial moments but made up for it with some incredible music).The highlight of 'Lords of Chaos' is the dynamic between Kristian ""Varg"" Vikernes (Emory Cohen) and Euronymous (Culkin). Joining Euronymous' record label as one-man band Burzum after Dead's suicide (and eventually becoming Mayhem's bassist), Varg seriously believes that Mayhem is a Satanic band for the select few (""touring's for posers"") and that Christianity is evil, which motivates his church burnings. Euronymous - by contrast - is a savvy businessman (who Varg accuses of being all talk). He knows the Satanic element is to get people talking and he starts a record label - Deathlike Silence - and a metal record store. As the story progresses, Varg becomes more extreme and enveloped in his various personas, where Euronymous starts worrying about the repercussions of Varg's actions and how it will affect Mayhem. While these people are quite reprehensible, Euronymous is probably the most sympathetic.If you love metal, you'll enjoy 'Lords of Chaos'.",Lords of Chaos
27,patriciogl10,"Whether events depicted are true or false, it still isn't by any means good.",4,25 October 2019,"Lords of Chaos deals with the story of the Norwegian Black Metal bands sub-culture in the 90s, and the direct involvement of the scene's most notorious people, such as Euronymous, Varg Vikernes and briefly, mentally ill ""Dead"". To black metal purists this movie feels like a parody, a product unbelievably bad mostly due to writing and alleged lies fed on camera. It might as well be all true, and still that wouldn't make it a great film, let alone a good one. The story is interesting to a certain extent, but it feels poorly executed. True or not, all this black metal enthusiasts seem fake, which takes away the credibility I'm not so sure they deserve. They engage in despicable acts just for shock value without any real meaning behind their actions. And when you come to realize these events actually took place, it diminishes the impact it really had. And it affects the movie as well, not so kindly.So all these characters begin at certain point in the film to look like a joke, which in turn makes the film look like a joke, or a parody. The only okay thing about Lords of Chaos is Rory Culkin, the rest is just below average.Maybe I'll have to wait for a better film on black metal culture of the 90s, or maybe I'll come to realize that is not that interesting of a story to begin with.",Lords of Chaos
28,Bertaut,"Equal parts funny and harrowing; an enjoyable ""true story""",7,10 April 2019,"Authenticity is perhaps the most important currency in music. Bands who can legitimately say ""it's all about the music"" and actually back that claim up are automatically head and shoulders above their less authentic rivals, who may sing a good game, but who live a very different life. Think of how fake Guns N' Roses made the glam metal bands of the 80s look. Think of how pampered Nirvana made Guns N' Roses look only a few years later. With this in mind, Lords of Chaos looks at late 80s/early 90s Norwegian black metal, and asks, ""was its extreme image authentic or manufactured"".Adapted from nm9657667 and Didrik Søderlind's 1998 book, written for the screen by Dennis Magnusson and Jonas Åkerlund, and directed by Åkerlund, the film depicts black metallers as fostering an image of a cult-like group of militant anti-establishment Satanists who practised human sacrifices, championed suicide, and advocated anti-Christian violence. Behind the scenes, however, most of its adherents knew such declarations were simply marketing, not to be taken literally. Lords of Chaos is about what happened when some black metallers took them very literally, leading to suicide, arson, and murder. Equal parts darkly funny and unflinchingly disturbing, Åkerlund's film never takes the scene as seriously as it takes itself, and, depending on your perspective, that's either its greatest strength or its most egregious failing.Oslo, 1987; it is three years since Øystein ""Euronymous"" Aarseth (an excellent Rory Culkin) established his band, Mayhem, determined to create a new subgenre of ""true Norwegian black metal"". The band has met with little success thus far, but that changes when they hire Pelle ""Dead"" Ohlin (a superb Jack Kilmer) as lead singer. Showing self-destructive tendencies from the start, as time passes, his behaviour becomes more erratic (cutting himself at gigs and spraying blood into the crowd, sniffing from a bag containing a dead bird before performances), ultimately resulting in his suicide. Meanwhile, Euronymous meets awkward fan Kristian ""Varg"" Vikernes (a very creepy Emory Cohen), on whom he initially looks down, but who he soon welcomes into the fold. However, as time goes on, and Varg becomes more and more extreme, a dangerous power struggle between himself and Euronymous slowly develops.An extreme offshoot of thrash metal and death metal, black metal was generally derided by the mainstream and criticised for its misogyny, racism, homophobia, and glamorisation of suicide. It was also seen as both anti-semitic and anti-Christian, and a number of practitioners have been accused of neo-Nazism and hate speech. Often wearing ""corpse paint"" and flaunting Satanic iconography, musical integrity was paramount, and to remain a true black metaller, one couldn't court mainstream success.One of the film's most salient aspects is that black metal wasn't simply a genre of music; it was a way of life. However, Åkerlund (himself a co-founder of black metal band Bathory) isn't especially interested in valorising the movement, with the majority of the film designed to chip away at the image of black metallers as evil incarnate. In this sense, the story is primarily about image and marketing. Euronymous isn't an especially gifted musician, but he is an astute businessman, particularly when it comes to selling himself, knowing exactly how to cultivate the reputation he wants - a picture of a corpse here, some ""evil"" lyrics there, and soon the mainstream is in a frenzy and doing his work for him. Proto-outrage culture, if you will. Whereas some of the others saw evil in a literal sense, he saw it in terms of branding. Nowhere is this clearer than when he finds Dead's body, taking pictures which he would subsequently use as an album cover to bolster the band's reputation as extreme.It's in relation to the manufactured nature of black metal's evil that much of the film's ironic humour is to be found. Euronymous and Dead's answering machine message is a growled, ""we can't come to the phone right now because we're too busy sacrificing children"". Describing their style, Euronymous proudly declares, ""when people hear our music, we want them to commit suicide."" Later on, he admits, ""all this evil and dark crap was supposed to be fun."" One member of Mayhem is shown riding a pushbike. Euronymous has to borrow his parents' car to get anywhere (it's difficult to be taken seriously as a purveyor of terror when you're in your dad's Volvo). An impassioned speech about the nature of black metal is interrupted by someone being told their kebab is ready. Euronymous complains of Christianity, ""they're oppressing us with their kindness and their goodness"". And in easily the funniest scene in the film, as Euronymous and Varg wait outside a recording studio, a group of elderly women emerge, with Euronymous running up to them and growling, ""Hail Satan!""Where the film treats its subjects more seriously is in relation to things such as Dead's depression, which ultimately results in his suicide, and the misogyny of virtually every member of the movement (it's telling that the first time we see Varg exert authority, it's in a scene where he forcefully tells (fictional) groupie Ann-Marit (Sky Ferreira) to take off her clothes). In relation to Dead, when he cuts himself on stage for the first time, the camera shows us he is utterly unmoved, suggesting he doesn't even feel the pain anymore (when he is first introduced, there is a shot showing scars up and down both arms). As he sprays blood on the crowd, the camera pans over to Euronymous, whose face betrays a mixture of horror and jealousy - he knows, even at this early stage, that he could never be that extreme.From an aesthetic point of view, the film features three notable scenes; two murders and one suicide. All three scenes are long, shot matter-of-factly by cinematographer Pär M. Ekberg, and sparsely edited by Rickard Krantz. The two murders feature repeated stabbings that seem to go on forever, but it's the suicide that really got under my skin. I'm not sure if it's the length of time it takes (Dead slowly slits one wrist, then the other, he waits a bit, then cuts his own throat, waits a bit more, and then shoots himself in the forehead), if it was Mattias Eklund's sound design wherein we can literally hear the knife tear the flesh, if it was the lack of cutaways, or if it was the close-ups of the wounds, but I found the scene harrowing. Brilliantly done, but harrowing.Another aesthetic element worth mentioning is that the actors all speak in English with their own accents (think Sean Connery in The Hunt for Red October (1990)). Personally, I find this far less distracting than everyone speaking English but with Scandinavian inflexions - why would Norwegians be speaking English to one another in Norwegian accents? It's a little jarring at first, but you quickly acclimate yourself to it, and it ultimately proves far less distracting than an actor with a God-awful accent.In terms of problems, some will take issue with how ironically the film approaches the material. The repeated shots of band members leaving their parents' homes does seem to betray something of a judgemental jokey disdain. Additionally, the film never tries to convey just what drove these young men to make this kind of music in the first place, or why these poorly recorded ultra-depressing songs garnered such a fanatical following. It wouldn't have taken a huge amount to address this, and the absence of any material which speaks to where the black metal ideology came from leaves a sizeable lacuna. A knock-on from this is that the film downplays the movement's more horrifying activities; suggestions that they were just dumb kids who let things get out of hand provides an excuse that isn't justified, and undercuts the severity of what some of them did. The film also avoids the racism and homophobia in the movement.In one respect, Lords of Chaos is an act of de-mythologizing, attempting to show that this frightening group of Satan-worshipping church burners and murderers were really just middle-class kids with a case of ennui. On the other hand, it illustrates that what had started out innocently led to some serious real-world ramifications. Euronymous is depicted as a wannabe cult leader, but one who doesn't subscribe to his own ideology of violence and rebellion, and is completely at a loss how to put the genie back in the box when certain members take his words literally. Lords of Chaos is his story before it is the story of black metal, and this is a vital point. Unafraid to show that the movement was built on a flimsy hodgepodge of paganism, Satanism, and Nazism, Åkerlund suggests the underpinning ideology is convoluted nonsense. For adherents, this will prove offensive. For everybody else, the ironic humour, harrowing violence, and thematic nihilism gel to form a fascinating film that's well worth checking out.",Lords of Chaos
29,pivic,"A great portrayal of youth, not a sensationalistic exposé",8,24 April 2019,"This is a very human and teenagey look into the lives of a sensational and deeply troubled bunch of humans.Åkerlund's video-making style is obvious right from the intro, where a band is rehearsing in a basement; my first thought was ""this reminds me a lot of Whale's 'Pay for Me' video by...oh"", and yes, it was by Åkerlund.The most sensationalistic and easily exploitative parts of this film could have been made entirely for shock value, which I don't think they have been. Watching them, I felt completely sickened, which was heightened by the lack of music and also by the most realistic effects I've seen where suicide and murder on film is concerned.The music itself is wondrous to see, as I dig black metal. However, the big payoff here is how youths work. It's clear for most people to see that the inner workings-and dysfunctions-of the members of Mayhem and others who made their way into this demi-shared psychosis all just wanted to fit in with their clique really badly, and all went tumbling down.I think this is a very well-made film, on every level.

30,TuesdayThe17th,"Deep, bloody, disgusting, horrible, and awesome....like a stab to the gut",10,1 June 2019,"So many reviewers are so harsh and rate really good movies so low. This is one of them. That goes to show the idiocy of so many viewers. I myself am a film addict and am developing my first film. When i listen to filmmakers talk horror film, I can relate and agree with everything they say, adding some inventive twists of my own. The Lords of Chaos lines up with the talk of the type of films I love. Bloody, unforgiving, brutal, and most of all real. Rory Culkin shines in a tour de force performance in what I think is his best film to date. Well known music video director and director of 2002s ""Spun"" Jonas Akerlund depicts a harrowing time in history. The birth of Norwegian black metal. The characters are well developed and the story is raw and very very dark. You can tell that the director is a metal head himself as every single scene feels carefully choreographed to fit the essence of the film and the attention to detail is flawless. One of the best things i can say about this film is that it is truly deep and the kill scenes are intense and effective. The effects are top notch and there is lots of blood and violence. Also there are many graphic sex scenes depicting the girls as sex objects and nothing more as well as a horrible suicide showing. The whole movie feels morally wrong and im surprised it was even able to be made. It went too far. But thats what extreme and exploitation cinema is all about. Its 2019.

31,cgearheart,Was it supposed to be a parody?,4,9 March 2021,"So I've finally watched this movie and yeah, it's still bad. However, I also somewhat recently watched ""Until the Light Takes Us"" and I can safely say that the members of Mayhem are nothing more than edgy hipsters. Their whole way of looking at things is pretty stupid. This movie felt less like a biography (though it covered pretty much the whole ground of the band's origin), and a lot more like a big middle finger to the band itself. I can't really say that bothers me too much because these guys are pretentious d-bags but it still bugged me a lot. Here's why it felt like a satire/parody:The entire movie is in English despite the characters being Norwegian. The only characters that are played by Norwegian actors are the journalists.Varg and Euronymous are portrayed as whiny brats with a taste for mayhem (pun may or may not be intended).Various things about the characters were changed, especially that of Euronymous. Euronymous never really smoked and he didn't have a girlfriend (many people said he was gay).Varg, a slim anti-Semitic man, is portrayed by a pudgy Jewish guy. I believe this was absolutely intentional solely to piss the real Varg off (which worked).The tongue in cheek narrative and editing
So either which way, the movie was still bad but if the director has confirmed that it's a satire, I would probably enjoy it more. There's no way he's ignorant to all the stuff I just listed because he (the director) is Norwegian, a former black metal musician, and a music video director. Wacky, funny stuff.D+",Lords of Chaos
32,BrickNash,Watchable fluff,7,2 March 2019,"I was all set to hate this film. The trailers looked cheesy and chap and it just seemed like a terrible cash in on an ancient story.I was pleasantly surprised to find that the film was well made and had some really good production values. The pacing is decent too and the film doesn't hold back on the graphic violence which is good. The cinematography is excellent, and the cast as a whole is actually quite good, with the standouts being Rory Culkin and Jack Kilmer.There are a few really silly things which bring the film down though, the first being the American accents. These people are actors and so they should have had no problem prepping to either speak Norwegian or at the very least, speak English with a Norwegian accent. Anything would be preferable to hearing the characters say ""True Norwegian Black metal"" (A highly overused phrase in the film) in a broad yank accent.The other big negative is the portrayal of Varg Vikernes. Emory Cohen is absolutely terrible in the film, and even worse, he neither sounds like nor has any of the mannerisms of Varg. Nobody really knew how Euronymous sounded or acted and the same goes with Dead too, so these characters are free to be interpreted. However, Varg is one of the most famous and recognisable black metal personalises living today. He even has his own YouTube channel, so for an actor this should have been a role handed to them on a sliver plate. Instead we get a performance which neither looks. sounds, nor acts like the real thing, and that was a huge faux pas by the director as well as a very lazy performance by Cohen (who apparently deliberately did no research on Vikernes).Still, aside from those glaring flaws and some bad dialogue here and there, the film is a decent watch. It's serious enough most of the time to be enjoyable, and I say that as a black metal fan.Certainly no masterpiece, and it could have been better, but it could also have been a disaster which it absolutely is not.",Lords of Chaos

34,torrascotia,When stupid meets dangerous.,6,8 April 2019,"This movie is apparently based on real world events in Norway when a death metal band decided to live what they preached in music or to use rap parlance to ""keep it real"". Welll folks just like the Dave Chappelle joke goes, when keeping it real goes wrong.
This movie is told from the viewpoint of the band leader who adds narration throughout and played by a Culkin, sibling of Maculay he of home alone fame. Try wrapping your head around that casting decision? I actually thought they would have used Norwegain actors speaking their own language for this movie however they went with an English language line instead so we hear American accents.
The plot is like any band movie so its like Bohemian Rhapsody but with death metal and alot more violence and blood. The violence in this movie is of the same level as you would find in a horror movie, thats no exaggeration so if thats not for you then avoid. However this is probably right up the alley of the target audience which is death metal fans.
The tone of the movie is quite odd as it flits between humour, mainly aimed directly at the band members who come across as being quite stupid and pretentious, with extreme violence and dark content. Mixing horror elements with comedy is not easy task and in this case it doesnt really work as the jokes dont really make you laugh out loud and seem out of place.
The outcome of the real story is easy to find out online however the release of the movie now may bring some unwanted attention to some of the players which they may not welcome. However they did what they did and sometimes you need to face the consequences of your actions.
This is really a story about what happens when the easily led latch onto an ideology which promotes hate and act on these ideas. Its obvious that this story chimes with the recent rise of IS in Syria and Iraq as it wouldnt be hard to imagine some of these guys joining up. The other link with IS and this movie is that from what we have seen in the Middle East recently, the events in this movie is no longer as shocking. Unfortunately we have seen much worse so these events kind of pale into comparison.
Should you watch this movie? A UK critic Mark Kermode said this movie was to do with toxic masculinity which is nonsense. It has very little to do with being a male and everything to do with extremist associated with religious or semi-religious beliefs, we can also point to the fact that females exist in this world willingly.
If you want a break from all the real chaos that religious extremism is currently causing in the world then this will be a bad choice. Similarly if you are looking for a rock comedy as this aint Spinal Tap or Bad News.
It seems to be aimed firmly for the metal scene and those who already knew the story and are curious.
I wouldn't recommend this to a casual viewer due to the violent content or anti-Christian sentiments . These are not humans most people would want to spend any time with but as we all know, for some thats the attraction.",Lords of Chaos
35,babyjaguar,LORD OF CHAOS OR LORD OF MOCKUMENTARIES!,5,6 March 2019,"This genre film inspired by the book, ""Lord of Chaos"" as a retelling or reworking on ""true"" events of the Norwegian ""Black Metal"" band, ""Mayhem"". Whenever a film of cult figures is dramatized, it always brings up a critical debate amongst die-hard fanatics with others (to borrow a word from Rory Cuklin's portrayal of Mayhem's leader, Euronymous, ""posers"").This film adaptation works for some viewers as an intense gory or ""ultraviolent"" arthouse film (think of Tarantino's early works). In which this one has playing at arthouse-styled cinemas, and of course at some horror-thematic film festivals. It's fairly reminiscent of those Italian ""Mondo"" and ""shockumentary"" movies (but really feels like a ""mockumentary"" on Death Metal) with off-kilter editing to make particular scenes unnerving.Its dialogue and scenes are delivered with awkwardness and ""tongue-in-cheek"" references to 70s-80s ""dubbing"" voice technology, 80s/90s horror cliques and subcultures: Deathmetal heads (with ""corpse paint""), 70s/80s Euro-exploitation cinema, etc.. The director does intensify the onscreen violence that has sent some viewers out of the cinema.But that's about it... it didn't really need to directly reference Mayhem (even though it missed a chance to showcase the actual music); it could have pull it off by making characters and situations fictional. But the film does have a certain headbanger ""charm"" (like 2018 hit, ""Mandy"") that will probably take its seat amongst a piling grave of cult flicks (with a sales pitch...

However, what begins as a series of mean publicity stunts soon takes a much darker turn when someone else enters into the fold.A vague synopsis helps the film stay unpredictable as the band's extracurricular activities escalate and evolve, sinking them deeper into Satan's clutches. And it's safe to say, the less you know going in, the better. I don't like evil metal music, nor do I like Satanists, but 'Lords of Chaos' has a strong pull that's difficult to resist once ensnared in its amoral deeds.Rory Culkin is solid as the protagonist.

He's not a ""poser"", but he's not an ugly disciple of the dark lord either; he's still tethered to humanity, which keeps him from being unlikeable. His grasp on band leadership grows weaker as he's constantly tested by a new member (ironically named Kristian) who isn't just an idealistic talker - he's the real deal: awful, villainous, hateful.Overall, 'Lords of Chaos' is a great music drama/thriller with horrifying moments that makes for suitably uncomfortable viewing.8/10",Lords of Chaos
37,autisticreviewers,Autistic Reviewers opinion on this movie.,9,28 November 2018,"Without knowing what to expect and what it would be about, Lords of Chaos is not only a solid piece of film but an engaging, darkly comical but at times a tense drama film based on actual true events that took place within the uprising of Norwegian metal music in the late 80's and early 90's, revolving around bands Mayhem and Burzem.With having said that, the rest is really best to be seen unfolded in front of your eyes to leave an amazing impression as it had on us. The script and pace work is great, there's never a dull moment despite a few sequences that can be confronting for its subject matter (including suicide, murder and religious retaliations. The acting range is great with no signs showing of mis-casting, the performance of Rory Culkin and Emory Cohen together is great but really tense in it's third act, whilst it's director Jonas Åkerlund helms with his past experiences in being in a metal music group. Surprisingly, the film carriers a lot of darkly toned humour and brutal moments of violent crimes for a drama film, being based on the biographical book of the same name.Lords of Chaos is really an unexpected surprise of a film, only not long ago we saw the impressive Bohemian Rhapsody but this film (which is most likely to get a bigger release next year) takes it higher with its true story behind it, the age of metal music and the brutal events that took place.4.5/5

There were a few scenes I found myself turning my head not watching what was happening because when it's graphic it is very graphic. If you want to watch something and you're kind of curious about it go for it just be prepared. There's animal cruelty. Death scenes that are very hard to watch.

Don't know how accurate it is because a lot of people are on here saying that it is very inaccurate, but I think it would be fair to say that it is loosely based on true events.From what I looked up, it seemed like Dead's death was pretty accurate. They just failed to present his full suicide note and just made it say. ""Excuse all the blood. Let the party begin!"" and while he did start with ""Please excuse all the blood"" in real life, from what I read online he actually went on to explain how he actually wasn't human and that his life was all a dream he was about to wake from. Its clear the dude was very mentally disturbed, and from an empathetic perspective, its just really sad that he never got the help he needed.

Yes, they were all probably like that and the film understates it if anything.Black metal is a thing. Yes there is a point about the desecration of Asatru shrines. No it does not justify anything.

47,gabethurau,"Imagine a Black Metal ""SLC Punk"" without the charm or comedic value",4,25 November 2019,"I have no problem with the Culkin brothers as actors. Kieran was good in the second season of Fargo, and Rory was good in Signs. I can't remember what the other one was in...it will come to me. So, casting a Culkin for the central character is fine by me.Moving on...The guy who played Varg was just not doing it for me. He looked like he was permanently clenching his sphincter to hold in a fart. His outbursts were not convincing either. Every moment was stiff; every thrown chair was done with the biomechanics of an inebriated Godzilla.Regardless, the thing this movie got so wrong to me was the inauthenticity, which I suppose is one of the biggest tenets of the movie: what it means to be a poser versus a being in an authentic Norwegian Black Metal band. These actors just didn't feel like they had immersed themselves in the culture. It just felt like they were playing dress up.At least with a movie like SLC Punk, the characters felt a little more ""real"". It could have been the mockumentary format, it could have been the better acting, and it could have definitely (for sure) been a more impressionable time in my life when I watched it, but SLC Punk, somehow, with all of its quirks and silliness, felt much ""realer"" than Lords of Chaos. Which does not bode well for L.O.C. because SLC punk was blatantly phony on purpose.Lords of Chaos just feels clumsy to me, in almost every way.

49,sorendanni,"Not Kult, but check it out anyway!",8,14 October 2021,"Lords of Chaos is a semi accurate film adaptation of the early days of Mayhem and the Nordic Black Metal scene. I'm not a fan of Extreme Metal, but I admit I've always had a morbid fascination with the tales of murder and arson that characterized the fledgling Black Metal scene.During the movie, a twist of style happens, whereby I am not sure whether it was the conscious intention of the director, or just a goof by not being sure how to tell the story a the start.The film starts lightly, almost comically. Mayhem in its early days: schoolboys aged 15 or 16, rehearsing at home. They love Speed Metal and Trash Metal and their dream is to become the biggest band one day. Funny things happen and for a while I feel like I'm watching some sort of mockery of a Black Metal band.It's no spoiler that Dead committed suicide, but it strikes me that this is a turning point in the movie. Everything gets less funny from here on, but more serious, darker and more dramatic. There are even some nightmare scenes that makes it almost like a horror movie.Euronymous is confused with the part of him that just wanted to be cool, just have a big band. His other part, however, is his image taking over. He presents himself as Nihilistic, anti-social and he talks a lot about what he thinks True Norwegian Black Metal should be about. And then there's Varg Vikerness, the Count. He doesn't have a sympathetic, cheerful side. And he doesn't talk, he's just bad and only cares about his own politically incorrect ideas.Actually, I liked the funny parts more. Still, I thought the later, dramatic piece was beautifully filmed and fits in nicely with the mythos about the 2nd Wave of Black Metal. Varg killing Euronymous is beautifully portrayed. Even though Euronymous was never sympathetic, you can't help to feel sorrow for him.A must for those who are interested in the stories around Black Metal, less interesting for those who are a real fan of the genre, they will probably say: Not Kult.",Lords of Chaos

51,jthaule,"Amusing, but highly problematic",6,2 March 2019,"So, this film has sparked a lot of negativity from the people who were involved in the actual events. Nearly universal, and for a good reason. Its presentation of the storyline and events is radically altered from the real history.Now, this is understandable, and common with films. Reality has no dramaturgy, and to make reality into an enjoyable film you have to change things. However, when this is done to a story where people are still very contentious about the facts and where the events involve two counts of murder, a very controversial suicide and various other serious crimes it's a bit more important to get the story straight.Most of the casting and acting is very good, and the film is professional and looks good. Rory Culkin does a very good job, and as a tribute to Euronymous it's a good film. (Even though it overlooks just how extreme the man really was on numerous occasions.) The film also does a good job in showing just how the vicious cycle of destructive behaviour was in this group, and just how horrendous some of the events were. I also give kudos to the film for taking the psychological impact of Dead's suicide seriously.The actor portraying Varg Vikernes is something else though. He has no physical resemblance to Vikernes, and no acting skills. Though you might say he does a good job of showing how pathetic and self centered Vikernes was and is, the effect is quite often one of involuntary comedy. (Granted, something Vikernes is good at himself, though.)As a film, it's OK. As an introduction to Norwegian Black Metal it's not very good, and as a retelling of history it's best avoided.",Lords of Chaos

54,johnnyrj,it's all fun and games until...,9,26 February 2019,"Ah yes! Teen angst. We were all teenagers once and some of us even went as far as to rebel, and what better outlet was (is) there than metal? Thankfully nobody in my group back in the late 80's and early 90's ever took it to the point of murder and burning down churches. What an utter waste of life and culture. If there was anything positive to come from this mess it was the Norwegian Black Metal music genre, which on the whole is interesting and took metal in a direction it hadn't really gone before. The only downside was that back in the late 80's and early 90's, apparently no one in Scandanavia had ever heard of a bass guitar or sonics, nor knew much about engineering and mastering so all the recordings from that era sound like mid-range garbage. It's nearly impossible to distinguish what's going on with specific guitar parts because typically everything was recorded on a boombox or with one microphone in the middle of the room and it all ends up mashed together in a cacophony of sound that isn't very detailed.The movie is pretty well directed and follows the book pretty faithfully. The murders are pretty shocking and brutal. All of the so-called black metal fans are whining and moaning because the movie makes them out to be idiots, but if you step back and look at the facts of the cases, you'd have to be an idiot to pull this stuff and think you are going to get away with it or think that it's going to accomplish something other than landing you in prison.A real satanist rejects organized religions and forges his or her own path and follows his or her heart without harming anyone else in the process.",Lords of Chaos

58,AnDread_The_Blind,Tongue-in-Cheek Look at the Personalities Behind the Birth of Black Metal,8,23 February 2019,"I'm a huge metalhead, and though I enjoy all kinds of metal-traditional, death, doom, industrial, progressive, stoner, thrash, even a few glam and nu metal bands here and there, I've always struggled with black metal. The music often eschews melody for dissonance, structured around repeated chords that, depending on the speed, create an atmosphere of plodding doom or frenetic chaos. Production tends toward lo-fi, either intentionally or as the product of financial limitations. And then there's the earnestness in the lyrics and imagery, taken so seriously by musicians and fans alike, with an elitist mentality that at times veers into the murky waters of nationalism, fascism, white supremacy, and eugenics. Still, I've always been fascinated by the history of black metal.While Lords of Chaos the film, unlike the book it is ostensibly based on, is not about the birth of black metal as a musical subgenre and aesthetic/philosophical movement (if you really want to call it that), it does provide a close look at the personalities behind that pained emergence. I can see this making the stories of the figures in Norway's ""Black Circle"" more accessible to a non-metal audience unfamiliar with black metal or the crimes committed by its founders. And while metalheads, especially black metal elitists--purveyors of the trve and kvelt--have complained that the film is inaccurate, doesn't focus enough on the music, or sensationalizes the events depicted, these criticisms do not hold. As for accuracy, this film is a dramatization, not a documentary, though as far as I know, in general it doesn't depict anything that contradicts what is known from news reports and interviews. Some of the details may be invented or exaggerated for effect, but that's to be expected. And as far as the conflict between Euronymous and Varg goes-the central crux of the film-there have been contradictory statements made by Varg and others involved in the early Norwegian black metal scene, so that it's impossible to know what ""really"" happened between them.As for not focusing enough on the music, I will admit this was a bit of a disappointment for me, as the aesthetics of black metal are very important to understanding the actions of those early black metallers. There's enough to give those unfamiliar with black metal a taste of its sound-with inclusion of Mayhem's iconic ""Freezing Moon,"" perhaps one of the greatest and well-known black metal songs of all-time. But they rarely talk about music. There's a hilarious conversation about the progenitors of black metal, British speed metal band Venom (in paraphrase): Varg scornfully sneers: ""Despite all their Satanic lyrics, with Venom, they said it was all just part of their image. They didn't really believe in it."" Euronymous answers: ""Saying it's all part of their image is...just part of their image."" Since the movie is more about the people behind the music than the music itself, I suppose going into further depth was unnecessary, so I don't think the film deserves to be taken to task for not doing something it never set out to do. Still, would I have appreciated a little more music? Sure.As for sensationalizing events, the actions of the Black Circle included suicide, church burnings, and brutal murders. So they're already inherently pretty dramatic. Now, if these things were done by people not directly responsible for two of the most foundational black metal bands of the early 90s-Mayhem and Burzum (Varg's solo one-man project), or if it made these actions seem the product of truly evil, otherworldly villains who actually were trying to unleash Satan on Earth, then that would be sensationalizing the events. But the film takes a more humanizing and subtly satirical approach, showing Varg eating toast, Euronymous getting flowers from their parents, and-gasp-even showing shreds of feeling for people. Perhaps this is what bothers black metallers: rather than shown as incarnations of evil, Dead, Varg, Euronymous, Faust, and others are shown as rebellious, vain, insecure, spoiled, and sometimes naïve teenagers trying to provoke the most extreme reactions possible by claiming all the things seen as taboo as their own. In Norway, one of the most prosperous countries on the planet, with socialized health care and cushy prisons (just watch videos of Varg in prison; it looks much nicer than what a lot of people outside of prison have in the U.S.), they got bored and needed something to make them feel alive.The actors all do fine jobs of conveying all that and what I would imagine the various figures to be like. Dead, Mayhem's original singer, as a quiet, morbid, tortured soul; Euronymous, Mayhem's guitarist, a pompous but savvy propagator of the black metal aesthetic, who maybe was in it more for the thrill than actual belief; and Varg, who transforms from a meek and shy admirer of Mayhem to band bassist and competitive sociopath desperate to prove his commitment to a mysteriously sinister ""cause."" The real Varg isn't happy with how he is portrayed as ""power mad"" in the film. You killed someone, dude, and I don't buy the whole self-defense shtick. For anyone who is curious, watch a few of his videos on YouTube or read a few pages of any of his weird pagan-neo-fascist screeds. Actually, just take my word for it: portraying him as a power-hungry sociopath is pretty much accurate.I don't know if I've done a good job of describing the actual film. Let me try to sum up by saying it's partly tongue-in-cheek, partly raw and unflinching portrayal of a small group of Norwegians creating a new subgenre and anti-establishment aesthetic. Despite the touches of humor that show the Black Circle as pretty much similar to glam rockers (thriving on beer, sex, juvenile delinquency, and loud music), it takes the church burnings and deaths seriously. We see Varg and Euronymous setting a few churches ablaze in the northern sky, and you get a sense of both the communal loss their destruction engendered, as well as the perverse thrill of taking down such hefty religious and national symbols of pride.Dead's suicide comes with a sense of sad banality-he was in one of the most influential metal bands of all-time, his parents seemed to love him, yet depression had such a grip on him that death appealed to him more than life.Faust's murder of an older gay man is depicted as an impulsive, senseless, brutal act.And the final confrontation between Varg and Euryonomous is realistic and painfully drawn out-after all, Vikernes stabbed Aarseth 23 times. If there's one distortion, it's probably in making Euronymous look more sympathetic than he actually was. The film even uses a voiceover from him throughout, as if the audience needed a heroic anchor to keep from being disgusted by everything and everyone involved. If you're interested in the ""truth,"" there's plenty of resources out there, including the book Lords of Chaos, though that's been criticized for inaccuracies as well. Black metal isn't pretty, but it is fascinating, and this film has helped along my growing appreciation of it. Excuse me while I go listen to my Darkthrone records.",Lords of Chaos
59,Gorgorgorgoroth,Looks More Like an Indie American Teen Parody Film Than a Biopic,3,13 March 2019,"The 2 biggest problems I have with this film are the cast and the acting.Why would people in Norway speak English to each other? Wouldn't it make more sense if you hire actors speaking Norwegian if the movie takes place in Norway? Almost everyone in this film speaks English in an American accent. It does not feel like this film takes place in Norway at all.The acting is HORRIBLE!After Euronymous finds Dead's corpse and tells his band, one of the band members starts arguing with Euronymous after Euronymous has made necklaces from pieces of Dead's skull. The acting is so dull. I was not buying anything they were saying to each other.Most importantly, the actor who plays as Varg is incredibly laughable. He looks NOTHING like Varg and is too fat to play as Varg. His acting is horrendous. I couldn't take anything he was saying seriously. He speaks with little emotion and you feel as if you're watching a play rather than a film. Everytime Emory Cohen laughs in the film, he sounds so awkward and cringy.Lastly, this is a small issue, but after Euronymous has sex with his gf, he starts to get a bunch of weird visions about Dead in the woods as if you're watching The Ring. What was the point of that?I was really looking forward to this film since I enjoy some black metal bands, especially Burzum.

Other issue is that I really don't know who is going to go and see this black metal being a very marginal phenomenon. Therefore large population might not be interested in the topic and ""trve black metal""- people seems to despise the movie before even seeing it because of how the characters (might) be represented, in addition to the lack of support (and original music) from associated musicians. Ok, we hear Freezing Moon from Mayhem, but if I'm not mistaken, that was it.I suppose the movie tries to be some kind of growing up story but as such it´s only mediocre and as said, every character in the movie is unlikable with very little redeeming qualities. Based on interviews, the story follows actual events pretty truthfully, though some of the details are surely largely made up. There is also odd comedic undertone which occasionally feels awkward. I can understand that the black metal aesthetics might seem laughable to some, but still these comedic elements feel pushed as the whole story in general is pretty grim. I noticed same problem with Åkerlund's Polar. He does not seem to get the balance between brutal violence and ""comedy"" right.Overall the movie is still watchable and maybe those not familiar with the story will get more out of this.

I was suspect when I heard that Rory Culkin would be playing Euronymous, but he does complete justice to the man, and disappears into the role.

At 2 hours long, I feel like more time should have been spent developing the side characters. Faust gets a bit of an arc, but Hellhammer is totally abandoned.

This doesn't mean those aren't interesting characters, far from it, but the movie doesn't really achieve anything valuable in that respect.The subject deserved a more honest global take, or an even more subjective vision. At least it shows how sad these gus were.",Lords of Chaos

Brutal scenes and seemed to stay true to much of the information I've accrued over the years. Varg hates everything, but this seems to be more of his angle on what happened, which in general terms was that Euronymous was a ""poser"" and took credit for things that weren't his. Hey, it's a movie not a documentary. Only Varg really knows what happened that night and he's already told the his side of things. It's well made, entertaining, and very brutal at times.

This is somewhat based on actual events, so it fits in a weird kind of true crime/horror niche. I don't think I need to worry about spoilers here as this info has been around since the early 90s, but I'll still stay away from them.As a film fan: I loved it. Well made. Brutal. Good music.As a metal fan: eh. It clearly takes some liberties on the events that happened, which is unfortunate since most of the guys are still around and events are public record, but it is a movie and they sometimes sensationalize things to make them better for the film. I was a metal fan and musician back then, and still am, but I'm able to separate those feelings and judge the movie strictly on the movie.Really much better than I expected it to be. I waited until it was streaming on Hulu to watch, but would have gladly paid to see it. I'll probably watch it again, and rewatchability says something for it.8/10",Lords of Chaos
72,bricemavillaz,A potentially great story ruined by a director that has no clue what he's doing,4,24 April 2019,"Saw this one yesterday night, as a regular wiever, as was disapointed; as a metalhead who was 14 when all of this happened, I was ashamed and embarrassed. I 've lived through these times and it reaaaaaaally doesn't feel like what i experienced. All the grittiness, uneasiness and depravity that this scene conveys were completely tossed in the trash (and the director was a session drummer for Bathory...supposedly).
The tone is all over the place. It starts as a light comedy (a movie about black metal...seriously??), switches to social drama near the middle, and ends up as a horror thriller. Most of the actors are TERRIBLE and really don't resemble the people they are supposed to portray. The guy playing vikarnes is ESPECIALLY BAD, every line he speaks, every look he gives is so overly exagerated it pulls you straight out of the movie and makes you want to slap him in the face (that's made worst by the fact that he's already playing an obnoxious character). Rory Culkin is meh, he doesn't look intimidating at all, but gets a pass because he at least mildly ressembles the guy he's portraying. But for a guy supposed to have a lot charisma and wits, he passes of as a shy geek who has no clue what he's doing. All the other characters are rarely named and all look alike, so you have no clue who's who during the whole film and quickly stop caring about them.
You're quickly left with only 4 main characters, one of which never existed (ferreira) and an other one that disappears halfway through the film (the guy playing Dead - awful).
The only part that I kinda enjoyed is the part where Dead and Euronymous live together in a cabin in the woods, because it's the only part that closely ressembles the real thing. But unfortunately the guys playing Dead is a really bad actor, his (short) part consists of worried stares into nothingness and terrible, terrible monosyllabic lines.
Speaking of wich, the things that drags this movie down the most is the dialogue. Who wrote this garbage? Because it really feels like he didn't feel like it. This movie has some of the worst dialogues I've ever heard in a movie...it honnestly sounds like this :
-""hi"" -""hey"" -""whats up"" -""nothing"" SCREAMS -""saaaaataaaaaan"". Special mention to ""what are you, a f*ùking CHICKEN??"" (edgy right?? and that's one of the most well written line). It honnestly doesn't get better than this. Rarely have i heard such uninspired and mundane dialogue in a film, it all sounds like small talk you'd hear at a random bus stop. AWFUL, BORING dialogue from start to finish.
The movie almost never focuses on the musical production and the concerts, and instead chooses to emphasize the criminal activity, from church burnings to stabbings. Speaking of which, the director really seams to LOVE stabbings, because the two scenes where stabbings occure are drawn out to a ridiculous extent.
And i'll rapidly mention the fact that bits of comedy randomly pop up here and there, which makes the whole thing look even more like a random mess. ""tea anyone?"".
To sum it up this movie doesn't know what it wants to be, 90% of the actors are TERRIBLE, the dialogue and actor direction are laughably bad and the director should stick to making music videos, because appart from the visuals this guy has clearly no clue what he's doing.
An average watch for anyone into metal (kind of makes you ashamed of being a metalhead though, talk about a backfire), a dreadful, messy and mindless bore to anyone else. Worth 5 stars out of ten TOPS, rating this movie above proves you don't really like quality cinema and have no clue of how it's supposed to be done. A potentially interesting story completely ruined by an imature director and terrible actors and dialogues.",Lords of Chaos
73,falbpe,The black metal artists were a bunch of stupid clowns,1,15 March 2019,"The message of this movie, like all movies that try to be close to the metal music is that the typical metalhead is a sort of stupid and alienated individual, that only open the mouth to say stupid things and that in the nights run for the street screaming Hail Satan without any sense, and destroying public property. Heavy metal movies are most auto-indulgent comedies, with zero depth and insights, almost like the directors desperately trying to make this musical genre politically correct.
Burn churches, specially christian temples, has become a mere joke over the time, nobody have in the world of today any respect for the Christians, and in Lord of Chaos the fires are presented in a amusing a fun way. But the assassination of homosexuals is another matter, and the soundtrack become sad and dramatic for first time in the movie in the moment of maximus gore.
None of the characters have any depth, are only mannequins, and only Varg and Euronymous were played with any sort of psychological insight, but their portrayals are just so beyond the true that I wondered if this is only a propaganda film. Yeah, Øystein ""Euronymous"" Aarseth was a good guy, than begged for mercy like a little baby in their last moment, and Varg a insecure fat man, with a stupid bodyguard; and the kill threat of Aarseth to the Count, a mere joke. But the metal media is happy, the metal community has been trapped for the leflist media in the last years, and they need clean some unpolitically correct genres of very bad ideas and romanticism, yeah, the important thing is to have fun and drink a lot, and drink chocolate seem evil and creepy for the standard of today.
I really find ten thousand times more obscure and appealing a movie about underground music like Only Lovers Left Alive, than this sort of generic crap. But congratulations Mr. Jonas Åkerlund, the lucky man 13-months session drummer for Bathory, until Quorton fired him, for his little interest in the extreme music, and more commercial approach, you really have succeed in present a bunch a lies and half-trues like a real history in BBC.",Lords of Chaos

I thought that the story was intriguing and sad, and I found myself very engaged with what I was watching. There were three scenes in particular that really stood out and shocked me. I thought they were relatively realistic and very emotional, but what really stood out to me was the performance by Rory Culkin.

The casting is bad, especially Varg´s character.
The subject of the matter is something that is really hard to research and put on film. The black metal community pretty much shuns any attempt when someone is trying to be document the 90´s Black Metal movement.
You really need to make it gritty if one is to succeed something of this magnitude. Takes a very skilled actor to do this too. David Fincher would pull it off. If someone can make something dark and dirty it would be him.

Though this specific realm is unfamiliar to me personally, the way the NBM scene is portrayed feels highly accurate. The characters aren't one-dimensional, yet layered with confliction emotions and ethical quandaries, adding to the realism.The overall visual style, direction, story and acting was perfectly suited to the source material, lending an aptly bleak tone with moments of dark levity.This deserves higher ratings and critical acclaim, but perhaps, as in the case of the journalist portrayed, the critics and general audience don't have enough of a sense of the story and context to make an accurate judgement.Even if going by filmmaking attributes alone, it effectively paints a coherent narrative in a concise storyline, backed by deft production and directly.

Insulting the dead is always a questionable move so maybe that's what the film maker was going for with his depiction of Euronymous. It also seemed to simultaneously praise Varg while also making him out to be a poser. This hodgepodge of buddy comedy along with extremely awkward romantic undertones is a complete waste of time.

However its by no means accurate to what really happened, this isn't a true story like the imdb page implies it is, this is no biography, but that honestly doesn't matter, this is a movie and like in a lot of movies that are based on true stories, some liberties were taken to give it a better sense of flow and make it more entertaining in general. If you want the true story go watch documentaries and interviews related to the black metal scene, the liberties this movie took were a good decision in my honest opinion.

I mean, the true story material alone is a dramatic goldmine; In the hands of great writers and a director on the level of say... Paul Thomas Anderson or Bennett Miller, this could have been a wonderfully complex study of these young men's rapid decline into extreme Sociopathy.
Instead we are given cartoon characters. Goofy portrayals, with ham-fisted and lazy character archs. Which it seems, is purposefully embarrassing to the metal scene as a whole. Vice have had their grubby exploitative fingers in the black metal pie for a while now, as part of their larger mission to truly celebrate and hype the worst and most superficial traits of human nature.

Worst of all, it does a poor job of getting across why black metal was important or why anyone should care about it. Black metal fans will be disappointed, and those who have never heard of Mayhem or Burzum will come away from 'Lords of Chaos' with the impression that the scene was populated with only small-minded people doing stupid and horrible things to one another.

Both leads are solid. There are bits that made me laugh, but also the film is disgustingly gory as I found myself watching through my fingers at various points. There is graphic self harm and suicide, as well as two horribly slow murders in the film which are very unsettling. In regards to whether this is a parody, I think you gotta remember two things 1. the music industry is built on myths and legend and PR from day Robert Johnson onwards, this is one of those key stories, and this film tells that story well. 2. the egos and personalities of musicians are often silly and ridiculous, as seen in true docs such as Anvil or the recent Bros documentary which were both perhaps unitentionally funny.

It's a cheap Hollywood fairytale with some vague similarities to the real story.

94,goldbarn,Good movie but questionable direction,8,11 July 2020,"Lords of Chaos is one of the first books I read as a teenager, as I was getting into black metal, so naturally this movie was right up my alley. As far as the story goes, the movie is pretty faithful to what is described in the book, and the production, cinematography and acting are also very good.My first major criticism has to with the overall direction (or vision) for the movie, which is a matter of preference. The director chose to depict events from the perspective of Euronymous, who takes a light-hearted approach to narrating the story, at one point stating that it doesn't have a good ending for him. My preference would have been to tell the story from a neutral, 3rd person POV, without narration, and without overt attempts at comedy. You can still have humor come out naturally through dialogue, since teenagers obviously have a sense of humor. In other words, I would have preferred a dark, European arthouse drama to a Hollywood teenage comedy/drama.My second biggest concern has to do with the depictions of Euronymous and Varg. Euronymous is portrayed as a harmless narcissist, who is all about promoting his and his band's image, and who doesn't believe in following through with all the shocking acts (arson, murder, etc.) they talk about; whereas Varg is portrayed as an ideological sociopath who is fully committed to doing those acts. There is probably a lot of truth to those portrayals, but I can't help but feel uneasy about portraying Euronymous as the innocent victim (good guy) and Varg as a cold-blooded murderer (bad guy). This is where I would have liked a bit more balance. I also think casting Varg as a chubby, unattractive person and portraying him as a buffoon for comedic effect takes away from the authenticity. I honestly don't have sympathy for the guy and never cared for his music, but it came off like they wanted to troll him badly.The door isn't shut on another Mayhem movie that is more faithful and balanced. Shortly after Lords of Chaos come out, Necrobutcher (original bassist for Mayhem) released a new book on the early years of Mayhem that should provide future directors with plenty of new insight, and I would love it if Hellhammer (Mayhem's drummer since 1990) were to provide extensive interviews in preparation for a new film. Ideally, this film would include Norwegian dialogue and the full blessing/cooperation of the original Mayhem members and any other relevant players from the early black metal scene. Maybe Lars von Trier can direct it :)",Lords of Chaos
95,recoldblood,"Better than I expected, but...",6,2 March 2019,"There were unfortunately many flaws I struggled to accept. For starters the script is very inconsistent, at times coming off as down right cringy. Perhaps the director finds the genre and people involved cringy and that was why it came out that way, but it wasn't so much the characters (except Varg), it was more the acting and execution of badly written dialogue. The character Varg feels completely different than the real guy, for example in appearance, his entire demeanor, and I swear like four different scenes were just him saying ""aye lets burn a church"", like some crack addict that really needs his fix. They tried really hard to also portray Euronymous as a sympathetic character, and truly being murdered and all in itself makes him a fairly sympathetic character anyway. Just seeing an autopsy photo with his hair cut, didn't mean the guy cut it before the murder, or that he wanted out but mean ol Varg wouldn't let that happen. It's a disservice to the actual man who lived for the genre. They also very much downplayed the death threat Varg had recieved, and it's a long way to travel all the way from Bergen to Oslo, to kill a man who you are not threatened by. Blackthorn went as far as to tell Varg, ""yeah man this death threat thing was said, but I don't think he's serious"". Emory Cohen was just a very terrible casting choice for Varg, and i feel bad because his acting may have been a lot better if he had a better character and script to work with, but he just in no way shape or form felt like Varg Vikernes throughout the film. Even his goofy cackle just always comes off as hilariously bad. He was instructed to be a stuttering Stanley throughout the film with very little confidence, and a whole lot to prove, and it just felt wrong. Also after burning the churches he becomes this hero that's just sexing women left and right, and it again seemed odd for his character. Anne Marrit was a pointless, and never existed (so not much else to say about her). Dead hated cats but didn't hang them on his roof as an ornament of sorts. I also hated how little music from Mayhem made it in, how no Burzum made it in (as expected), how the name's Darkthrone, and Emperor never made even though Fenriz (who I still can't tell where or who he is in the film, but he's in the credits), and Faust appear in the film. It makes so little of them that they seem to be mere posse members to Mayhem and Burzum, which I just found odd. Blackthorns credit was seriously just put as ""Varg's Driver"", which was lazy as well.Now as for what they've done well! Casting Rory Culkin and Euronymous seemed like a terrible decision, but it wasn't, he absolutely nailed that role, and I feel bad that the movie wasn't great because his performance absolutely was. The church burnings themselves use real 1/3rd and half scale replicas that looked amazing as they burned to the ground, very realistic stuff, and so glad they didn't use CGI for that. The stabbing scenes and Dead's suicide are some of the most visceral scenes of violence and death that I've seen in film, and I give them mad props for that. They also went through a lot to make sure it truly felt like it took place in 1987-1993, with all the bands, shirts, and cars fitting seamlessly to make it feel like an early 90's Norway, but unfortunately the characters accents work against that.In 2009 I had written a petition to stop production on this film, it disappeared and I was fine with that. I didn't see purpose as to why this film needed made, especially as it was advertised, ""A Psychological Teen Thriller"". What we got was better than I expected however it's full of assumptions and had some odd tone inconsistencies that prevented me from enjoying this more. I have been a fairly passionate black metal fan for almost two decades, so seeing a film made about it is quite odd, and it's unfortunate that it wasn't done by somebody who truly wanted to tell the story as it was, and carefully casted according to the actual characters. It's obvious Jonas cares little for the genre as he was merely a session drummer for Bathory for less than a year, and appears to hold some contempt for the genre and characters the story is about.Thanks for reading",Lords of Chaos

98,rafeortiz,"It's allegorical, and maybe inaccurate, but still a good movie.",7,6 March 2019,"There are super allegorical, glorious, and stupid representations of way worse events of humanity in movies that are praised like masterpieces, why so many people freaking out about this one? It's based on the events, it's not even suppose to depicture everything accurately, hollywood does that everytime, and some people got offended because they feel personally connected to the people being depictured on screen, but let's talk about the movie. This movie is surprisingly very well done overall, all comments saying that it is a ""teen drama"" come from people that only watched the trailers, i'm sure of it 'cause i thought the same thing based on the trailers alone, a very bad acted teen drama, but i was wrong. Of course, feelings are being represented in the movie, but i don't see what's the problem in that, do true Mayhem fans really want to believe that these guys had no feelings at all and were really these dark robotic psychopaths that had no fun at all through their life? I mean, the party scenes are a little exagerated probably, but mayhem fans seem to want to believe that these guys were these intellectual lords these just used to sit in fancy chairs in their dark castles and read books about satan, drink blood in a wine glass, and then go out sometimes to casually burn some churches and murder people, that sounds very stupid, but back to the movie. Even if i don't love every character, the dynamics between them were perfect, Euronymous is very charismatic, but not in any time did i felt like he was some kind of hero, he was very screwed up in the head, and who knows the story knows that the real Euronymous wasn't any type of good person, but this is a movie based on the story, they decided to give Euronymous the role of most normal one, which is not saying much because everyone is screwed up in this movie that even if you are a little normal you still very much insane, i absolutely love the fact the Erounymous was always flirting with the idea of getting out of that ""evil life"" and go live normal life, but he was right back on the crazyness everytime he saw an opportunity to make Mayhem famous as the ""most evil band ever"", which tells a lot about his sociopathic mentality, the fact the was able use photos of his dead friend to promote his band, a friend that at some point he cared about and was ""kind of"" trying to get him out of depression, tells you much about him. I love the idead of having Dead as a ghost that haunted Euronymous from time to time, in the second segment of the movie, when the church burnings are going crazy, Euronymous thinks about Dead, because if you think about it, the whole ""being evil"" thing and doing more absurd stuff and always trying to go to next level was something that was pushed by Varg, but was primarily influenced by Dead and his actions, on stage, and even his own suicide. He was the beginning of the madness.
I didn't like Varg's character very much, don't know if he was badly written, or if the actor's performance didn't convince me, maybe a bit of both, and his segment of the movie did lose me a little bit not gonna lie, but his dynamic with Euronymous was actually good, and if you take out that fact that Varg was a complete psycho, he just comes out as envy, winny playboy desperate for attention, which kinda explains why Varg's fans are so mad at this movie. At the final crucial scene when Euronymous is getting stabbed, i love the fact that even in that situation Euronymous saw a marketing opportunity for the band, that was just perfect for really painting the character, and even if he was just trying to get Varg to stop stabbing him with that idea, i prefer to believe that he genuinely thought it was a good idea to promote the band.
The movie is very well done, well acted and well written, the overall visuals are good, it's not trying to be too stylized, it feels raw and real, the violent scenes, specially the two crucial moments, Dead's suicide and Euronymous stabbing are very explicit and gruesome, but not in any moment of them did i felt that they were stylized to be something like Saw torture porn type of thing, in Dead's suicide scene you can really feel his depression, and that he's just letting go, specially because the scene comes out of nowhere, Dead's just chilling there and suddenly decides that it was time to end it all, all those elements make this scene very, very impactful.
I'm giving a 7 star to this movie, i would give 8, but as i said before, Varg's segment kinda lost me through the movie, that's why it's a 7. definetely worth the watch.",Lords of Chaos
99,emilkruse-65695,As expected from Vice films,1,24 February 2019,"A terrible mess of a movie about a very real and interesting story. I cannot tell if they portrayed Dead really well or really bad since he is supposed to be emotionless, unlike the rest of the characters.
Where the MIGHT be some accuracy would be with the way Euronymous is portrayed. A little, scared communist who wants to take credit for something he had nothing to do with.
Where there is definitely not any accuracy is with Varg's character. With a name like Cohen, there is already a strong argument against the cast but picking a fat person to portray a skinny person? Come on, he is twice the size of most of the other characters.And what were they thinking with the kills? Who gets up, after being stabbed in the chest multiple times, and walks around and yells like a drunk? Not to mention a certain killing scene involved a glass of chocolate milk. Who is drinking that, you think? Varg the fatso of course.Overall this makes Scary Movie 5 look like a Tarantino movie. What a waste.",Lords of Chaos
100,hectorrutter,"While not accurate to reality, it's still brilliant",9,31 March 2019,"This film messed me up completely and made it very hard for me to sleep last night. Even as a write this, I still have so many of the images from the film stuck in my head just because of how disgusting this film was. Lords of Chaos follows the mighty true Norwegian Black Metal band ""mayhem"". Mayhem is a very good word to describe the events that happen in this film as events keep getting worse and worse, starting off with a suicide to eventual church burnings and murder. The film does not shy away from showing you these as well and will be sure that you feel the full weight and horrificness of the bands actions. It might sometimes portray these events as friendly moments but the film makes sure you know that the film does not condone the actions of the band.
I really loved the power struggle at play in this film too between Varg and Euronymous and how that is basically the main focus of the plot itself. The two bounce off each other well and Varg really makes the rivalry disgusting with how much he keeps trying to raise the bar.
But what did I think of the film? Personally, I loved it. Probably the most messed up cinema experience I've had and one that will sure not leave me for a while. I understand that the story may have been fictionalised but I still believe in this story and what it showed to be both entertaining and horrific. I don't understand the people that say the film is trying to be a comedy when it really isn't. The film is far more involved with showing how messed up the people were with the terrible actions they committed and the karma that came from the ideas they had.
Either way though, I loved this film. It's beautifully shot, well paced, well acted and has some wonderfully metal songs in it. But this film is not for the faint of heart. It's a real tough one.",Lords of Chaos

But the tone of the film and the drama it eschews are unforgivably bad.To me it strikes a tone somewhere between bemusement and outright contempt of its subject matter and it's characters. It's a bewildering mish mash of fairly graphic violence and rather poor attempts at comedy, that may work in a Rammstein video clip but falls miserably short here.And as Black Metal fans know the novel it was based on was full of inaccuracies and outright lies, and there seems to have been no move to correct those here.Poor effort all around really.",Lords of Chaos
102,EdoSchipper,Lords of Chaos - a self contradicting mess,5,8 March 2019,"Growing up, I loved looking for extremes in music. I gravitated towards Black Metal and quickly became familiar with the mythology surrounding it. I indulged in the documentaries and articles and found some appeal in its over the top nature, whilst also distancing myself from it all. I was, along with many people familiar with the stories, quite surprised to see this film come out; an american production about the satanic, church burning craze that was 90's black metal in Scandinavia.Lords of Chaos attempts to visualise the history of 'true norwegian black metal' but is in constant conflict with itself in doing so.On the one hand, the film makes its subjects intentionally cringy, and the way most events are played out, the audience can't help but snicker at its silliness and at just how over the top it all seems. On top of that, the events are over dramatised, and characters are added to the story left and right to add some sense of character development.On the other hand, there's a sense of genuine authenticity. The music, imagery and setpieces are all very accurate. I wouldn't be surprised if many of the locations used were the real deal. The music is unaltered, the action is brutal. Fact of the matter is, that a lot of the events in the film, happened in real life.This conflict leaves me conflicted also. What is this film going for? Does it want to cater to fans of black metal? Does it want to prove a point in the ridiculousness of what happened?",Lords of Chaos
103,fifmut,"Ignores Reality, Completely Fake and Dishonest",1,25 January 2019,"One could believe that the creators of this movie were simply ignorant of the real events, they haven't done their research properly... but no, that would be too naive. The information is out there, easy to find, in many sources. The creators just chose to ignore it and tell lies. This movie is simple character assassination, nothing more.

104,polakphil,Wasted opportunity.,1,27 February 2019,"The real life story of what happened in the Black Metal scene in the early 90s is an enthralling, insane, and equally disgusting crime story about murders, suicide, jealousy, revenge, egoism, mass vandalism, court cases, jail, seriously right wing politics, and the scourge of society. One could have given it a similar platform to some of the Netflix series like for Ted Bundy, or OJ Simpson, and it would be edge of your seat stuff.But what we get here is some kids cartoon version. With parties, blowjobs, made up girlfriends, jokes, horseplay, and a total mockery of all the main characters and the events for humour purposes.I legitimately think that this movie is trying to troll the scene and the story by flipping all the characters and making up their personalities to seem like they're the kind of people you'd associate with a nerdy internet forum. Instead of some seriously messed up individuals that were in the wrong place at the wrong time for these crazy set of events to take place. They've really made a serious crime story into a teen party flick of some kind.This movie may appeal to some people, not sure who, cause if you want some teen flick there are much better ones out there, maybe it's for people that have heard of the bands involved but don't want to hear the real disgusting story, but want to laugh at the edgy kids from the 90s that used to wear the face paint and make the loud noisy music in Scandinavia.",Lords of Chaos
105,ggrieves-49299,Joans Akerlund is up there with Spike Lee! Hater's READ THIS REVIEW!,9,12 August 2019,"So I see a lot of haters reviewing this and I have 2 things to say to you. For Jonas, the director to be from that region where the Black Metal genre was founded I am fairly sure, no 100% sure he was into this genre and researched the hell out of it before making a feature length film. For those not familiar with his films they exert quite a lot of emotion in their stories. Watch Try Try Try for example. It is entirely back by the Smashing Pumpkins song. I have never been left so utterly speechless at the immediate end to this short film followed by tears. Also directed the Black Hole Sun music video by Soundgarden. As for the cast anyone complaining about the acting is a fool. Emory Cohen is a huuuuge success with his role in The OA on Netflix and his role in The Place Beyond The Pines. The guy is a superstar on his way to be among the greats. Rory Culkin is a master is his little dark sub genre always sitting among the more eclectic roles usually dark in content. Yeah, this movie does have it's moments where I'd question certain scenes. I honestly feel like those bashing this film still think of themselves as dark disciples and when they see a film that shows exactly what it's like from an outer perspective they feel like it's mocking in a sense. I have a piece of advice for those that think that way. Wake the hell up!",Lords of Chaos

110,MrBanBan,Good timing. Art as a weapon.,2,1 March 2019,"The movie is entertaining.
It shifts generes:Hilarious/Tragic/Nihilistic/Slasher film.
Ackerlund (dir) had a good timing, for in 2019 we are living in a culture of anti-christianity, violence, satanism, homosexuality, nihilism, sex, depravity - all these things are seeped through our culture of youth, and have a very familiar taste to the view. Back then, these guys were living in that,Ackerlund shows it through the edited sex, party, and horror films in the background scenes.
He also shows the music for what it was or could be - one could take it seriously too far or not. Either way, these hedonistic attitudes is what we know as American culture of today, so it only makes sense to see it transformed into American accents, also for the fact that America is trying to spread its message onto everyone. Today we see this type of generalized nihilism coming through the pop culture of rap or soundcloud-rappers, which is the new punk, a reversal of GG Allin.
If culture can be shaped through art. Then art can be used as a weapon. Black metal was that weapon. I think with all the events that happened, it prematurely ejaculated, it was ahead of its time, for culture to catch up. 2019 I think we are pretty much there. For Ackerlund, this was also his own weapon.
He does show black metal in a black metal light. Death metal looks like a joke after this. And I do miss these times, when we would talk about these bands, and we would hang out.
I think this movie also shows human psychology and narcissism. Who knows, maybe Varg did grow up and now is living his simple life for the best. Maybe by being a good father he will raise his kids not to listen to stupid nihilistic music and kill bandmates and burn churches. Maybe he will find Jesus one day. And maybe Euronymous just wanted to make music. But that's the whole point: they were two different guys. Why burn down a church, when you can make music, and use your art as a weapon just like this director. I am certain he will make money from it because this is a cultural product of a film.
Whatever it is, I feel like this movies makes you think about life, and especially the nihilism of today. But whatever it is, I will always stand by Euronymous's riffs and his vision for black metal. This movie is about Mayhem, so it makes a laughing stock out of Gravy Grishnakh, and rightly so, because he keeps talking sht about Euronymous, but Euronymous can't say anything because he killed him! He just needs to let it go, but I understand why he is mad. Oh well, he is the one that's still making money from it all too.",Lords of Chaos

It seemed like it was on its way to saying something good about the balance between fantasy vs. reality in subcultures with a focus on performative evil & violence, but halfway through the movie I'd had enough of the gore, particularly a very gratuitous hate crime scene.
The gore called ""Green Room"" to mind - but this film does not benefit from the safe container of a genre horror film. It's much more of a drama that happens to feature horror-movie levels of violence - regardless of the real-life truth of the events, the implication that these are real things that happened to real people makes it so much worse than horror movie violence.

But Akerlund has a specific style and he sticks to it and I think it's cool.Rory Culkin does an okay job with a great role. I don't want to hate on anybody's acting here, because all around it was okay. But someone else could have really shined in the lead role. The real stand-out actor in this film for me was Jack Kilmer, who plays one of the smaller roles, unfortunately.I enjoyed the movie overall.

Akerlund shows exactly what these black metal-loving kids really are - nerds. Unfortunately for most of Norway, these nerds escalate things to new heights. Rory Culkin's portrayal of Euronymous feels exactly as it should, a young man trying to believe the messed up things he's preaching. Emory Cohen's Varg Vikernes is the kind of psychopath we know the true Varg to be. Ultimately, the movie brings to life one of the most infamous stories in music history, but it's biopic format doesn't break any ground.

118,ulvnoir,Tone deaf,3,9 March 2019,"Sometime in the early nineties a group of teenagers from Norway wreaked havoc upon their beautiful and peaceful country and created one of the most extreme forms of music known nowadays as black metal. Their story is grim and gruesome one, written by troubled individuals whose creativity was finally overshadowed by the deranged acts that they committed whilst trying to impose their vision upon the world. Lords of Chaos is a movie that takes this intriguing source material and turns it into mere chaos.In the beginning it is stated that this is a movie based on truth, lies and what actually happened. But I won't judge the accuracy of the story, because none of us was really there, so we can't be certain that church-burners wouldn't party hard, have casual sex or drink chocolate milk at a murder scene. What I will judge is the pacing of the movie and it's acting and both are awful. Firstly, it is a Wikipedia page script with few liberties that doesn't allow any character development whatsoever. If you don't know the key characters of the story, you won't find much about them here.What you end up with is 120 minutes of plot devices delivering lines of dialogue to push the story forward intercut with occasional scenes of graphic violence and teenage partying that feels so out of place that it makes even the aforementioned serious scenes unintentionally funny. In effect the whole movie becomes a farce. Scarce successful scenes with believable acting such as Dead's and Euronymous walk in the forest only make the viewer yearn for a better director and a an intelligent script. But taking into consideration the Norwegian scene's reluctance in portraying their exploits and the open boycott of this particular movie I won't see it happening anytime soon.I watched this piece because I really wanted to like it or to hate it. To have a strong opinion on such a divisive topic. But in the end Lords of Chaos just came and went leaving with me with a feeling of utter indifference.

It actually glued me for the second act and at the end I really enjoyed it.I am struggling to give it a higher than 6 rating (which is above average), mostly because of those first 20 minutes - I felt it could get a bit more serious/dark there and not show just some troubled teenagers, but also, I don't know, I guess it could tell the story better and even though I liked the acting (Emory Cohen with a stellar performance), it felt like it needed more fleshing of their turmoils and turns in characters that lead to A, B, C, D.All in all - when I am getting back and thinking about the movie the day after, it means that it was actually a good movie.",Lords of Chaos

""Smack My Bitch Up"" or ""Turn The Page"" are just two examples of his countless successes. But also especially his first movie ""Spun"" gained benevolently critics. With his thriller ""Horseman"" he could win Dennis Quaid as main actor, ""Small Apartments"" is an outstanding comedy and on Netflix recently ""Polar"" premiered. But if he did himself a favour with this one is questionable.The story of the early Norwegian Black Metal and the bands Mayhem, Burzum, Emperor and Darkthrone is widely known not only in the scene itself. A singer that shot himself and his band colleagues use a picture of his corpse as a cover and pieces of his skull as necklaces. A series of curch burnings and the killing of a gay man. Plus the summit of the power struggle of two protagonists ending in the brutal stabbing of Euronymous, who was founder of Mayhem and is the main character in Lords Of Chaos.Slam Alternative Music Magazine presents the movie at the Filmcasino. That it was produced at Vice Studios let the first ones in the audience murmur. During scenes like the brutal suicide of Dead people even leave the room. Jack Kilmer does a great job as do Rory Culkin as Euronymous and Emory Cohen as Varg Vikernes. Their characters appear convincing, and Åkerlund manages that the actions act conclusively.The start of the band and their way of living are told quickly in the beginning. But the longer the story goes on, the more the music itself gets the minor matter. Key locations are the cottage where Mayhem lived and the record store Helvete (nowadays Neseblod Records). Apart from all the violence, the script leaves space for some jokes, e.g. about Death Metal. For actions like the lighting of a cigarette Åkerlund uses his typical fast editing, but for the crimes he takes his time.And so the film ends with Varg, who is no longer the shy boy from the beginning, brutally stabbing Euronymous. His off-voice that leads through the movie relativizes his own death by saying he created Black Metal and Mayhem.

130,vladacokorilo,"If you are someone who knows little about the genre and these events, this movie is for you",3,2 March 2019,"About the movie:
Lords of Chaos, a movie based on a ""true story"" about the Norwegian black metal scene from 1987-1993, circling around bands such as Mayhem, Burzum and Emperor. The movie itself is based on a book by the same name written around 1998, with a gathered collection of stories or gossips so to speak, which indicate that the movie is sorely based on truth and lies, not necessarily how it actually happened. From the beginning, I knew nothing about the book nor the movie being in development, until I saw the music video for Metallica's song ManUnkind (also directed by Jonas Akerlund) showcasing Mayhem playing around 1990/1991. At first I was very hyped, because I thought that it would be interesting to see a live action movie about the notorious events of controversy, such as church burnings, murders, tension, dilemma and dispute between the members of the scene. But once I heard that the bands disliked the book, mainly because it was less authentic, more stereotypical, and that had me concerned. I didn't know what to expect from the movie, because if the the book was met with negative backlash, nothing could promise that the movie was going to be better and more true to the story, regardless of the fact that Mayhem, Darkthrone and Burzum were opposed to it's creation and denied that their songs be used in the film (even though Mayhem's songs were eventually used). After hearing various interviews with the cast and the director, I noticed that nobody had any awareness or knowledge about the genre, members or the events themselves (except for Jack Kilmer and Arion Csihar, Attila's son).Plot Summary:
The story focuses mostly on Oystein ""Euronymous"" Aarseth, the guitarist and founder of Mayhem, and his attempt to start a movement which would later be known as Norwegian Black Metal, influenced by the first wave of black metal bands, Celtic Frost, Venom, Hellhammer, Blasphemy, Sarcofago, Bathory and Mercyful Fate. Mayhem have been struggling for years to get attention from various metal fans around Norway and Sweden, to become the truest metal genre that would shock the audience and cause public fear, with Euronymous being the leader of the cult. An unfortunate circumstance occurs when the band's singer Pelle ""Dead"" Ohlin commits suicide by stabbing himself multiple times and ending his life with a single rifle shot in the head. Oystein is at first shocked and confused, but he later takes this opportunity to take multiple pictures of his bloody corpse to draw public attention, with a goal to become the first band with a singer who blew his head off. Jorn ""Necrobutcher"" Stubberud, the bassist of Mayhem, is disgusted and insulted with his deranged behavior and he quits the band. Sometime later, Euronymous opens his record store ""Helvete"" (Norwegian for hell) with his father's approval and finances, to sell only true metal. At the first day, Kristian ""Count Grischnack"" Vikernes (later known as Varg Vikernes) visits his shop and joins the gang, asking Euronymous to release Burzum's self titled debut album for his record company Deathlike Silence. After listening to his tape demo, he immediately accepts his request but on the condition that Varg pays for the printing of copies, due to him not having enough money. Varg accepts this decision and he starts recording the album in the studio owned by the producer Pytten. Oystein once suggested to Varg that they should burn down churches all around Norway. Varg of course takes it seriously by burning down Fantoft stave church, which day later caused a huge uproar and surprised Euronymous that he actually did it. During one night, Faust, the drummer of Emperor, spends his evening at a bar, noticing an elderly man staring at him. He leaves the bar, with the man following him, not long before asking him to ""go for a walk"" while touching him. Faust takes this chance to stab him to death and leave him to die, while nobody else was watching. He admitted to Varg and Euronymous that he was the one who murdered him, which impressed both of them, encouraging them to burn down more churches together and draw further attention. Upon watching the news, Euronymous realized what he had done. He began panicking and was afraid to admit what he was responsible for. He gave Varg a necklace with a piece of Pelle's skull, telling him that it was a chicken's skull, as a welcome sign to appoint him as the bass player of Mayhem. Soon afterwards, Attila Csihar from Hungary joined them on their recording of the first studio album, De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas. During a phone call, Varg suggests Euronymous that they blow up the cathedral that was on the album's cover, Nidaros Cathedral with dynamite, while also doing an interview with a journalist, with an attempt to take it to the next level. Euronymous is worried about the consequences and he tells Varg not to do it, fearing the outcome itself, but Varg declines it. His roommate Snorre, the guitarist of Mayhem, brings the journalist and his photographer at their home, During an interview, he admits that the events of church burnings and murder are tied to the local black metal scene and their Black Circle. The next day, Varg is arrested and spends three weeks in prison. Euronymous is angry at him, fearing that he had endangered him and he tells Faust that he wants to stun Varg with a taiser, put him in the back of the car, tie him up to a tree and torture him while filming it. Minutes before closing Helvete shop, he gets a phone call from Kerrang Magazine, requesting that he tells them what happened and the planned future for Mayhem. After Varg's release from prison, Euronymous gives him the latest issue of Kerrang magazine that contained Varg's picture with him holding a knife and a dagger (which was photographed by the journalist and the photographer), telling him that he feels betrayed for what he had done. Varg tells Euronymous that he betrayed ""True Norwegian Black metal"" by closing his shop and avoiding his involvements and responsibilities. Euronymous and his girlfriend Ann Marrit decided that he writes a letter, asking Varg that they no longer talk to each other, wishing that they stay friends and even sending him a contract for Burzum that would break the deal with Deathlike silence owning the rights to printing and selling the band's copies. Not long before signing the contract, Varg realizes his plans that Snorre heard from Faust, and without delay he decides to head over immediately to Oslo and end it. Before driving off, he took his knife and put it in the rear pocket of his trousers. Euronymous asks Ann Marrit that she gives him a haircut, and she agrees. Varh tells Snorre that if anyone asks him what they were doing that night, he said that they just pretend that they watched Die Hard 2. Few minutes after she left his house, they arrive later in the evening. Varg opens up to Euronymous about why he came, telling him that he knows what he had told the other metalheads, but Euronymous denies it and acts as if he never meant it. Upon giving him the contract, Varg stabs Euronymous multiple times and finished him off with a single blow in the head, therefore disclosing their conflict. When the police interviewed Snorre, he told them what Varg said, but due to him being nervous they suspected what he had told them, and later Faust and Varg are arrested. The film ends with a memorial altar containing candles and Oystein's pictures.Thoughts:While I do respect Jonas Akerlund's visual talents as a director, mainly the background and the outfits, I do not like how he handled the story itself. Most of those certain details are misinterpreted and falsified, because as I mentioned earlier, the script was not written by information from various commentaries and documentaries from the musicians involved. A lot of things in the movie are exaggerated, leaving a very stereotypical impression, especially to those that know nothing about the scene, the genre itself or what actually happened. Neither do we as viewers know the true story, but many documentaries such as Pure F*cking Mayhem, Until the Light takes us, Once upon a time in Norway and various ThuleanPerspective videos suggest what happened, because they all have a very logical connection. I'm not going to write what the true story is, instead I would suggest that you watch these aforementioned documentaries rather than this movie based on truth and lies, because it would take me a whole eternity to write about it and you'd be better of to hear from the members themselves what they have to say. So what do I think of this movie? Should you watch it? Overall I find the movie itself very bland and cringy, but like I previously mentioned, I do find the visuals, the locations, the outfits and the various metal songs I've listened to before very interesting. I suggest that you watch this movie with low expectations, especially if you're eager to see what it looks like or to see what the movie got wrong, but I would recommend that you watch the documentaries first, they're a lot better.Note: Next time you decide to direct a metal movie, be sure that Deathlike Silence by Sodom isn't actually Persecution Mania.",Lords of Chaos

132,cariminferno,More honest than Bohemian Rhapsody,8,11 March 2019,"In a way, it's a ""regular"" film. It does have its inevitable moments of melodrama, cheesy romance, and so forth. Leaving that aside, I believe it has done more to portray real events than an acclaimed movie like Bohemian Rhapsody. Most of the things that are happening in the movie have been reported as facts and even the chronological order seems pretty accurate.I enjoyed it as a film, it felt respectful to the metal scene and it showed some interesting points of view and psychological nuances and motivations for everything that was happening. The script was well written and it connected the dots properly.Perhaps, it won't appeal so much to people who are not into metal, but for people like me, it does the trick. In fact, I didn't expect it to be a good movie, but I certainly quite enjoyed it. And the end was badass.",Lords of Chaos
133,rebecca-55453,This film whould never have been made,2,12 April 2019,"With this film Jonas Åkerlund clearly shows that he is not a man that considers himself above relentless exploitation of past events, and neither does he shy away from altering history for the sole purpose of turning past events into easily digested teen drama.It is also extremely biased, shallow and lacks depth. You get next to zero background story of Dead whose state of mind and final act of suicide appears highly unrealistic and almost gets a comical, overly exaggerated feel to it in the film. His past is barely touched upon and he exits the plotline nearly as fast as he enters it, remaining nothing but a supporting character. (Also, the 13 $ blonde nylon wig from wish.com didn't contribute much to the character's authenticity.)Moreover, other important characters are completely changed and stripped of personal traits for the purpose of creating and cashing in on a crowd friendly teeny-bopper dark comedy flick about a group of angsty and narcicisstic adolescents. It is very obvious that the goal was to get all the right elements of positive character development and ""coming-of-age"" drama stuffed into the film, even if it, in reality, never occured (see Euronymous' highly fictional and sudden change of style and outlook on life at the end of the movie, just seconds before he is brutally murdered.) In the end, the entire film becomes a sort of redeeming portrait of Euronymous as a misguided, but actually quite likeable, youngster on the verge of adulthood. The truth is that Euronymous was very deranged and spiraling towards the end, and not in the process of ""bettering"" himself, changing his values etc (do some research.) In fact, if we go into details, Euronymous never even cut his hair. The coroner did, however, remove his hair post-mortem when performing the autopsy and there are pictures of this. Presumably, Jonas Åkerlund saw those pictures and made some faulty conclusions.Moreover, it is way too fast paced. The movie itself it quite long, perhaps a bit too long, but it still manages to feel rushed somehow. As previously stated, the characters lack depth and layers and therefore their motifs are sometimes difficult to understand. The most important parts of the story are either ignored or rushed through, while the largest portion of screen time is wasted on awkward conversations and Varg's cringeworthy laughter as he plots yet another church burning. The result is equally embarassing and half-assed.It also completely slanders black metal (and metal in general). I hate to be ""that guy (girl in this case)"" who takes everything a bit too seriously and can't handle the fact that extreme music is becoming more and more of a commerical, harmless thing that doesn't scare mothers across the globe anymore. But still, I am surprised that Jonas Åkerlund, a metalhead himself, willingly parodies and pulls this subculture even closer to mainstream media as laughing stock. There's a difference between having some self-distance, and creating an outright farce.4.) The wigs. Need I say more?",Lords of Chaos
134,daradyj,So torn...,6,18 July 2019,"I would like to start out by saying I am a big Mayhem fan and I tend to tell the band's history to people who obviously don't care enough to listen. But the film was...meh. They touched on the Wikipedia references that I already knew but I was still excited to show my husband (a cool dude that doesn't like black metal) a version of the stories I've always told him. My biggest problem was the casting. I don't entirely understand why they chose actors that kind of sort of looked like their real life counterparts, but didn't bother to seriously acknowledge the Norwegian heritage of the band. They didn't even bother with accents. The whole point of the black metal movement is to contrast the church's rule over government and lifestyle of their citizens (which still goes on by the way). It missed the heart and soul of the movement in favor of surface level reasoning that essentially boils down to ""varg was a neckbeard who took things too seriously."" Less than half way through the movie I realized that I was making excuses for the dramatic retellings of the story and I just decided to stop taking it seriously and treat it as a movie that I happen to know the ending. It's disappointing for any fan, but to any curious and open minded ""normies"" I can see it being a decent drama. Also, when I saw ""Vice Films"" I instantly dropped a star from any rating I would give it. I think that's why it might have come off more corporate and off-putting to fans.",Lords of Chaos
135,kelvynszanetti,Based on lies... and truth?,5,25 October 2019,"It has been almost 7 years since I started studying norwegian black metal scene by myself and I feel I can say that this movie is historically accurate... but not.First of all, I would like to say what I loved in this movie: Dead. He was so accurately described that it almost made me burst in tears. It's almost impossible for any black metal fan not love Per Yngve Ohlin, since he had all that ""energy"" that only him could really give. I can't really say if the chainsaw party was really true, but there were some innacuracies. First of all, Per Yngve didn't hate cats. He liked to run and scary them, but there's no documentation on him killing cats.Varg already knew Dead before he commited suicide. In fact, the ammunition that was used to kill himself was given from Varg as an birthday present.The idea that the movie gives is that Euronymous' life was short; like 1 or 2 years, but nope. His lifespan on Mayhem was from 1984 until 1993. And Dead killed himself in 1991. That's a long time and both of them was portrayed as being just good friends and Euronymous just reacted ""strong"" when in face to face with Dead's suicide. That's a total mistake. Dead and Euronymous used to have many fights, Dead used to sleep in the woods because of Euro's synths, and when he killed himself, Euronymous called Necrobutcher to tell him that ""Dead did something really cool!""The band had even confirmed that the skull pieces necklace was true, not some chicken bones.In final stance: Jack Kilmer (Dead) really did a great job. You can feel a very similar dark energy that Per Yngve inspired. Even the suicide scene was perfect. Dead will always be portrayed as some kind of transcedental being inside mayhem's history.There's not even one evidence that Euronymous' girlfiend ever existed and he was killed with long hair according to Varg. I really don't know why they had chosen Bard Faust to take Varg to Euronymous' house in the night of the homicide, since it's well documented that Blackthorn did it.I mean, we're not talking about anyone directing the movie but Jonas Akerlund, nothing more, nothing less than Bathory's first drummer. This man just saw the norwegian and swedish scene of Black Metal born and grow. Even though he directs a movie where Euronymous appears as a normal guy that just wants to create a new kind of music? The same guy that claimed to love the Stalinist socialism, that liked and exploited the friend's suicide, the guy that threatened many people of death. And he's just portrayed as a normal guy that wanted to create a new sub-genre of music and appear cool for everybody. Oysten was at least a mentally ill, maybe he wasn't really bad, but he wasn't a normal guy trying to be cool and respected.I'm giving this a 5/10 because of the first half of the movie: Dead. If you want some heart warming movie about black metal wannabe teens, then watch this. If you really want to learn about black metal history DON'T use this movie as a reference and neither the Lord of Chaos book. I really recommend Dayal Patterson's books if you want some more really trustable information.",Lords of Chaos

The story was told from an interesting point of view, I liked the fact that the director showed them as extreme young people groing up out of the social ""normality"" they were asked/supposed to fit in, and who finally lost control over their image and group ""pressure"", instead of showing them as reckless satanic monsters. It is hard, nearly impossible, to know what they really felt or thought at the time, but the humanising point of view was interesting to me.

Those two languages are so similar that we can say they completely understand each other speaking their native languages.

It could be an interesting movie for American auditorium bate it is really very annoying for any true Norwegian Black metal fan.,Lords of Chaos
149,Metalheim,A black metal music video,2,26 February 2019,"Lords of Chaos is a music video dressed as a movie. The main characters are Øystein ""Euronymous"" Aarseth and Varg Vikernes, two young black metal musicians. A competition between these two lashes out, as they fight out for the leadership of the black metal scene. Euronymous runs his record label, band and record shop, while Vikernes attracts his attention with a demo tape. Vikernes starts to rise in the ranks of this so-called ""black-circle"", a name that Euronymous invents for the core members of the black metal scene. The ""black-circle"" rebels against Christianity, other types of heavy metal, society and humanist values.The movie starts out just like you would imagine any movie about a rock-band doing: booze, women and promises of stardom. The first 45 minutes are the most enjoyable in the film as the young and insecure musicians try to find a way for themselves in a brutal fashion suitable for the music style. The criminal activities of the musicians soon becomes the focal point of the movie. The music they make is still there, but it is forced to the margin, as Euronymous and Vikernes battle for the supremacy of the black metal circles.Varg's character is not at all plausible. He starts out as a boy with no self-confidence, just trying to please Euronymous and his crew. Then he suddenly rises to black metal stardom, banging hot chicks and burning churches day and night. That is a very sudden change in the role of the character, leaving many question-marks behind. The other characters are there just to fill up and not much can be said about them. The only role that seems somewhat intriguing is Euronymous', although his sudden shift from a scary black metal boss to a regular dude who is afraid of any unwanted attention also seems extreme.This could have been an okay movie if the film-makers had dwelled just a little bit on the motives behind the characters. Now everyone is a bad caricature at best and there is nothing left to identify with. A two-hour long music video made about a few young men, who made noise in Norway almost 30 years ago, seems to me like waste of time.",Lords of Chaos

I am not a hardcore metal fan, I am an average listener and I have some knowledge about the events that inspired the movie. The movie itself is like a fantasy story actually. It is simplified and childish. Varg is like a comic book villain in this movie. Euronymous is boring as well (the fact that the screenplay adds a girl to this story just to give a simple (but not in the good way) romance story is... well NOT GOOD) No interesting personalities (but acting is although not that bad) and the story which tries to be interesting (by giving fictional plots) but it fails in the end.
