0,SnoopyStyle,Jonah Hill the filmmaker,7,29 January 2019,"It's mid-1990s California. 13-year-old Stevie learns to skateboard. He admires the local skater-kids. He gets bullied by his older brother Ian. His single mom Dabney (Katherine Waterston) had Ian at 17 and is more concerned about her own dating life. He is befriended by the skater-kids.Jonah Hill is trying his hand in filmmaking. He shows a good touch with his kids. My personal issue is that bratty little boys are my kryptonite. I find them annoying and Stevie is solidly in the range. This movie does remind me of Kids except those kids are simply evil and I don't mind evil kids. They're not Stevie who the audience is supposed to root for. Ray's conversation with Stevie does salvage my appreciation of these kids' comradery. One character not salvaged is Ian. He has a really odd scene with Stevie. It's a scene which requires Dabney which would flow naturally into her confrontation with the kids. Overall, it's an admirable effort from Jonah.",Mid90s
1,Horst_In_Translation,Jonah Hill the filmmaker delivers,6,9 May 2019,"""Mid90s"" is an award-winning American movie from 2018. Writer, director and producer is two-time Oscar-nominated actor Jonah Hill. I must say I am not really big on him as an actor at all admittedly, but he did a really decent job with this one that I am almost tempted to say that he may very well be a better filmmaker than actor. The next years (and projects) will tell. It is far from his first effort as writer really, but this was his first ""real"" movie as a director. What he directed before were mostly music videos and definitely not too many at all. You will not really recognize many actors in his film here. The biggest name in the cast is without a doubt Lucas Hedges, a pretty young actor himself, but also already an Oscar nominee. He plays the protagonist's brother. The main character himself is played by Sunny Suljic. And while Suljic has received some accolades for his portrayal and certainly done a good job with a character that is in basically every scene here from start to finish, it almost never feels like a character study. It is a bit of everything. First of all, like the title says it is about depicting the 90s and what happened back then. There are many references to this decade that started almost 30 years ago already now. Man how time flies. The references include t-shirts and a lot of other stuff. There is a Mr. Burns Simpsons mention. I really liked the Guile Streetfighter shirt early on. Beavis & Butthead are included as well. And there is a lot more. I won't go that much into detail now. But you will recognize it when you see it. However, the longer the film went, the less frequent these inclusions were which I thought was a bit of a pity. Still Hill did a fine job without a doubt in making this film look extremely 90s. I mean if you showed it to an unsuspecting crowd and tell them this was made back in 1990, they probably would believe it.Then there is of course the story of the main character, a boy struggling with violence from his brother and lack of a future somehow too during his puberty and there is certainly a coming-of-age component in here, not only because he makes his first sexual experience. It is also about friendship as these people he meets during the most uncommon introduction sequence that includes sexual references about parents and if you think that was a lot already wait till you hear what direction it is heading. But the friendship component also includes the slightly older boy that Stevie initially is friends with, one who is also fairly insecure (the ""thank you"" part) and who quickly becomes jealous of Stevie's rising popularity with the cool older guys. The T-shirt part is the best moment. Another would be if you look at his face when Stevie's mom shows up. By the way, it is absolutely not racist to ask if Black people can get sunburn! In general, Hill did a very good job with the casting and with making each and every character memorable in his own right. Even the silent guy with the camera has his moment in the spotlight when he keeps talking about his film ambitions that were pretty hilarious. There are many funny moments in this movie, you will laugh a lot watching it, most of all in these sequences when Stevie tries to seem all mature and grown-up, like when he tells his story with the girl from Disneyland. Overall, I quite liked the use of shades in this movie. The violent brother who is at the end at the protagonist's bedside is just one example here. No matter which character you pick, you will find realistically flawed people in here. Addiction is a subject for many. Or the mother who is caring, but also does not care much about her son recognizing how promiscuous she is. And while there are always conflicts between characters, especially the ""gang"", they always somehow stick together like when in the end they are all at the hospital. Sadly, there are at least 3 crucial moments when Hill messed up a bit. One would be the fact that they let the really drunk guy drive. I am not talking about how they should not have let him, this is obvious of course. But I am talking about how they would not have let him realistically. Maybe the two younger ones weren't self-confident enough already, maybe even the camera guy was not confident enough already, but I am 100% sure Ray would have interfered. Then there is the scene with the controller cable that is really painful to watch actually and I am saying this as somebody who generally does not mind violence in films. But to me this reaction did not feel too realistic honestly, just over-the-top to shock the audience. Other people may see it differently perhaps. And finally that the mother after the gang almost killed their son because of the alcohol does not mind them being around and still lets them see him. This felt especially unrealistic with how she acted earlier. There's just no way she would have changed her mind. And finally in the end with the closing credits the bridge Hill builds between the silent camera guy and this film we have here also felt a bit clumsy to me actually. But these criticisms do not destroy the film. Far from it actually. Maybe they just keep a good film from becoming a great one.. I was genuinely entertained from beginning to end here and I think this relatively short movie at 85 minutes certainly deserves to be checked out. It has some great comedy moments, some edge-of-seat drama moments and you can see from Hill's camera work that he has worked with some great directors in his career and learned quite a bit. Not one of the best movies of 2018, but definitely among the better. I give it a thumbs-up!",Mid90s
2,nogodnomasters,All kinds of sounds,3,21 January 2019,"Stevie (Sunny Suljic) is a misfit looking to fit in. His older brother beats on him. He is raised by a single mom. He finds friends in a Skateboard crowd of underachievers, also called his ""ghetto friends."" They give him cigarettes, drugs, alcohol, and a night with a girl. Stevie is not a great skateboarder and takes a beating.Not much plot. Not much action. The dialogue wasn't engaging. I would not have believed Jonah Hill was this boring.

3,blanbrn,"A reflection and look at struggle, peer pressure and finding acceptance.",8,28 October 2018,"""Mid90s"" is one short and to the point independent film that looks at life and growing up showing at a young age what it's like to find friends and be apart of the crowd and discover things at a young age. The way Jonah Hill made the film it will probably remind many of their school teen years as we all in some sort went thru these issues of wanting to be liked and feel free.Set in L.A. in the mid 90's it follows the troubled life of a young teen boy Stevie(Sunny Suljic) who's from a broken single parent home as daddy is not around. And his older brother(played tough by Lucas Hedges) is abusive and cruel to him. Plus Stevie doesn't fit in at school he's not popular it's like life is dull and boring. He just plays video games.That changes when he joins a diverse group of teens and his life now revolves around hanging out at a skate shop. and yes Stevie takes up the hobby of skateboarding! It's fun to see him fall, yet get back up just as Stevie has done all thru his life. Now change begins he learns plenty about life, culture, race, and how to accept and try new things. As Stevie smokes and tries alcohol for the first time and yes has sex and loses his virginity!Overall well done film of coming to terms and learning life with new friends and new things are discovered as it's important for Stevie to be accepted just like many of us remember it was important for all of us to be well liked too.",Mid90s
4,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Oh, Boy.",6,13 April 2019,"It might try to disguise itself as a sort of pseudo mood-piece, a visual poem driven by nostalgia, but there's no denying that it runs on a narrative like so many others. Little, to no, exposition doesn't excuse a weak story and it doesn't mean that there has to be a bevy of themes to take the place of a more rigorous one. See, 'Mid90s (2019)' is the sort of film where nothing really happens but where that just so happens to kind of be be the point, taking its cues from the recent 'Skate Kitchen (2018)' and, even more noticeably, its brother-piece 'Kids (1995)'. It tries to evoke a feeling through a sense of time and place. It's not necessarily all that successful - at least, not all the time - primarily because you don't really get a solid grip on its setting, especially for a flick named after it, and because the characters that we spend time with don't exactly exude the kind of camaraderie that's supposed to be oh-so enticing to us. Most of the movie is dedicated to candid scenes of kids behaving badly, which are engaging enough but don't evolve in the way you'd expect. Indeed, the entire affair ends just when you think its about to get interesting, abruptly cutting off several core-players' in-progress arcs with no real resolution. It doesn't help that it feels as though it's sometimes trying to be 'edgy' for the sake of it, even if it also has quite a few moments of pure authenticity. In any case, you often find yourself actually empathising with the parents and their very valid concerns. If you don't want to see drug-use depicted without judgement - and, essentially, consequence-free - maybe skip this one. It might sound like I didn't like it at all but there were certainly things to enjoy. The soundtrack, for one, is great; it evokes almost all the intangible feelings of youthful alienation and rose-tinted nostalgia that the movie itself can't quite crack. Most individual scenes also play out in rather entertaining ways. Na-Kel Smith's character is refreshingly mature and his performance matches - though, all the performances are pretty great, to be honest. It's just that the feature didn't feel as though it was really about anything. Was it about skating, the mid-90s, childhood, nostalgia or just friendship? The latter is the thing that shines through, being the most enjoyable aspect and most prominent theme. Still, as a whole, it sort of felt like there was something missing. I wasn't bored, but I didn't exactly care, either. 6/10",Mid90s
5,ThomasDrufke,An Earnest Slice of Life,8,30 October 2018,"Jonah Hill never struck me as the type of actor to transition into directing, nor does Mid90s exactly sound like first movie material for him as a director. Alas, it's one of the best films of the year and one that does so much with a very simple premise. The incredibly talented Sunny Suljic, from 'The Killing of a Sacred Deer' fame, stars as Stevie, a 13 year old who experiences drugs, sex, alcohol, and a summer of skateboarding as he navigates home life and everyday troubles in the streets of LA. Evidently inspired by Hill's childhood, Mid90s may very well be the most earnest film of the year, in which every word and visual seems entirely authentic. Something that even the best of directors struggle to capture. It doesn't have a vast story with dense characters, instead, it's a slice of life drama about young boys doing their darndest to have fun over the course of a summer. That's all you need sometimes.8.8/10",Mid90s
6,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,7,6 January 2019,"Mid90sThe biggest threat to nineties teenagers was having their baggy clothing sucked in to machinery.However, this dramedy depicts a number of other dangerous situations that generation tackled.Drawn to the rebellious fun of skateboarding, 13-year-old Stevie (Sunny Suljic) aligns himself with a rambunctious crew. Thanks to his daring nature, he quickly works his way up the ranks, drawing disdain from other skaters. Meanwhile, Stevie's new friends have become a point of concern for his mother (Katherine Waterston) and older brother (Lucas Hedges).Extremely similar to a number of coming-of-age dramas released in the 1990s themselves, first-time director Jonah Hill does a commendable job of bringing the era, its attitudes and its soundtrack to life. Meanwhile, the underage cast fit the slacker image to a tee and deliver the crude slang with legitimacy.And while there was wireless back then you only had coverage to the end of your driveway.

7,westsideschl,Rated?,6,17 January 2019,"An almost documentary look at how some skaters live their lives, in the '90s, in a way that would probably get an age restricted rating (obscenities, theft, vandalism, challenging authority, sex, gay put down). Most of the actors were first time & did a credible, although not challenging, job. The problem is that some of the actors themselves would violate that rating (lead actor was 13 at filming) so not sure about the effects of what was asked of them.",Mid90s
8,UniqueParticle,Very provocative but spectacularly fun to watch!,9,8 August 2019,"I think the only problem is the over the top amount of profanity for minors otherwise loved everything about it! Jonah Hill is an incredible writer/director there's a few parts that felt so authentic, like one of the skate park scenes when a guy talks to a few of the boys, that was inspirational and several other bits like the skateboard store scenes were great! I also watched this on my 27th birthday, August 4th which was cool being from the 90's; spectacular film for what it is! I would've reviewed it several days ago, I was just a little busy.",Mid90s
9,zkonedog,"Puts You In the 90s, But Mostly Effective For the Skateboard Crowd",6,14 January 2019,"The opening shot of Jonah Hill's ""Mid90s"" is a pan over the main character's bedroom, revealing a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles bedspread and Hulk Hogan plush wrestling buddy (both items I also possessed as a 90s kid). That sentiment really epitomizes the effectiveness of Hill at making the viewer feel as they have indeed been transported back to the nineties. Unfortunately, unless those same viewers grew up bumming around and turning tricks at skateboard parks or back yards, that's about all effective ""Mid90s"" will be.For a basic plot summary, this movie tells the story of Stevie (Sunny Suljic), a pre-teen in 1990s Los Angeles desperate to find an identity, what with his mother (Katherine Waterston) only wanting to describe her recent dates and his older brother (Lucas Hedges) pummeling him at every opportunity. Through some chance encounters, Stevie does indeed find a peer group, and they turn out to be skateboarders (played by Na-kel Smith, Olan Prenatt, Gio Galicia, and Ryder McLaughlin). As the rest of the film plays out, Stevie must come to terms--as do all adolescents--at what it is like to both succeed and fail and various life situations.Like I said, the hallmark of this film is its ability to represent the final decade of the 20th century. The manner of speaking, clothing, technology, just general mannerisms, etc., are all spot-on and engaging for those who ""lived it"" (I was basically the same age as Stevie in that same period, so I could relate as well as anyone). Hill's choice to basically use untested kids (not professional actors) in most of the film's roles also turns out very well, as the entire enterprise is very touching/emotional, yet also sometimes teetering on the brink of acting ruin. Ultimately, this serves only to highlight the anxiety Stevie himself is going through during the ""growing up"" process.Why the rather paltry six stars, then? Because it was clear to me that ""Mid90s"" was very specifically Hill's version of growing up in the 90s. As such, if you didn't learn to skateboard or hang around with that crowd, much of the ""punch"" will be lost on you. There's even one character (""Fourth Grade"") who is portrayed throughout most of the film as somewhat of an idiot who carries a videocamera with him everywhere and ""just wants to make movies"". Again, seems to very clearly be a Hill proxy.So, overall, I can call ""Mid90s"" a solid flick, but no more than that considering I am considerably outside its rather narrow range of instant appeal. Personally, I would more highly recommend A24's ""Eighth Grade"", which deals with similar themes but sticks to the ones that are more universal, widening the audience base by quite a bit. At just 85 minutes, though, ""Mid90s"" isn't really even long enough to be considered ""boring"" even if you might want to after viewing it.",Mid90s
10,Floated2,Not completely realistic as lead to believe,5,14 May 2019,"Mid90's is the directorial debut by Jonah Hill and much praise seemed be going around praising the film for its nostalgic 1990's feel and it's realism.One aspect which feels far from realistic is the fact that these older group of teens just seem to adopt the lead kid which is supposed to be 13 years old (but does look younger).With a very short running time, not much really happens but one could guess that the point was to show a day in the life of the lead. And of course with these coming of age films, it is filled with nonstop heavy language, drinking and teen partying.In short, Mid90's felt more like watching a group of teens just fooling around and not professional actors per say. There was authentic feel in that sense but is that a good thing? Decent film, could have been greater but is ultimately forgettable.",Mid90s
11,eddie_baggins,A likable throwback to the skating era,7,29 April 2019,"From an auspicious early start in low-brow comedies such as The 40 Year Old Virgin, Grandma's Boy, Accepted and Knocked Up, to comedy lead in classic Superbad and onto Oscar nominated turns in Moneyball and Wolf of Wall Street, the career trajectory of Jonah Hill is quite a ride, that at the mere age of 35, isn't going to be over any time soon.Taking the next big step in his impressive and building career, Hill has stepped behind the camera and in the writers chair to deliver his feature film debut, a likable, unique and nostalgic trip back to a time gone by with the coming of age skater-centric dramedy Mid90s.A small-scale film that focuses on the human elements, as we follow Sunny Suljic's 13 year old Stevie's movement into teenage hood and the then booming skateboarding scene that was prevalent across the world and in his home town of Los Angeles, Mid90s shows that Hill is not just a comedy one-trick pony as he instills his passion project with a heart and soul, that while not revelatory, acts as an extremely impressive calling card for the new phase of Hill's career.One particular aspect of Mid90s that is a massive win for Hill and in turn the audience is his ability to well and truly transport us back to the time and place in which Stevie's life-defining friendships and learnings take place.Filmed in a grainy and home-made like 4:3 aspect ratio, that is very much of the time and filmed in a way that takes the City of Angels back to this era, Mid90s will be like a trip down memory lane for many, where Wu-Tang Clan ruled the world, Etnies was clothing brand of choice, Playstation was a novelty and Bevis and Butthead were a staple of youth's TV intake.Being 11 at the time Mid90s takes place, its clear Hill has personal experience in this particular moment of history and his direction of Suljic and other members of his friendship group such as Na-Kel Smith as the charismatic Ray and Ryder McLaughlin as the slow witted Fourth Grade, is first rate, suggesting Hill has the ability to unearth his actors potential through keen direction and attention to detail.It's a breezy, fun and sometimes confronting ride (some scenes will be hard to stomach for viewers, with Hill not holding back from throwing Stevie into some rather adult situations), that's scored with a dreamlike intensity from Nine Inch Nail musicians Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross and while narratively Mid90s doesn't reach great heights over its brisk 80 minute run-time, there's enough here to highly recommend Hill's debut as a film worthy of your time.Final Say -The next career leap for the ever-evolving Jonah Hill, Mid90s is a nostalgic trip back to a time and place many of us would remember well that also features a great turn from the up and coming Suljic. On the basis of this effort we should all be excited for what Hill has install for us next.3 ½ Ren and Stimpy t-shirts out of 5",Mid90s
12,matthewssilverhammer,"A Messy, Insecure Movie about Messy, Insecure Kids",7,3 November 2018,"New teen drama Mid90s shows with cringe-worthy authenticity the awkward transition from tween to teen. That pervasive pull between our childhood innocence and our ever-growing adolescent arrogance. Each anxious decision is fueled by teenage politics and societal hierarchy; we move from our one overshadowing influence (parents, authority, and siblings) to another (age, class, and friends), with little thought to our own well-being, much less anyone else's. It's messy but also critical, much like Mid90s itself.
Set in the (duh) mid-90s, 13-year-old Stevie (played by revelatory discovery Suljic) looks to escape his faux-gangster older brother (a standout performance from Hedges) and overwhelmed mother by joining with a small crew of typical skater kids. The plot is intentionally thin, with little reliance on easy answers and predictable characters. Writer-director Hill opts to focus on feel, filling the film with grainy visuals, childishly offensive language, a strikingly killer score / soundtrack, and an old-school 4:3 aspect ratio, making it feel like an indie VHS from the late 20th century (think David Gordon Green or Steven Soderbergh, or homemade skate videos, more likely).
2018 has turned into the year of the actor-turned-director (John Krasinski's Quiet Place, Bradley Cooper's Star is Born), and Hill's care and heart behind the camera shines through nicely, even though his influences and insecurities aren't hard to pinpoint. His personal pretentions certainly make their appearances in the undergrad-level philosophies, making certain ""important"" moments ring a bit aimless. Nonetheless, Mid90s is an emotionally engaging and visually captivating directorial debut.",Mid90s
13,paul-allaer,Jonah Hill's Astonishing Directing Debut,8,28 October 2018,"""Mid90s"" (2018 release; 84 min.) brings the story of Stevie, a 12 or 13 yr; old growing up in Los Angeles in the mid-90s. As the movie opens, we see Stevie in a vicious fight with his older brother Ian. Some time later, Stevie admires his older brother's room (the mix tapes, the shirts, etc.). Stevie then discovers Motor Avenue, a skateboard shop, and it's not long before he acquaints the regulars there... At this point we're 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the directing debut of actor Jonah Hill, who also wrote and produced. And what a debut it is! One might say that this is ""just another coming of age film"", but that would be to ignore the authenticity with which Hill brings the story. The movie is filmed in almost, but not quite, 1:1 aspect ratio, giving it a claustrophobic sense. At times the movie comes across as documentary-style, where Hill is simply interviewing the gang as it goes about its skateboarding business. Ah yes, the skateboarding: truly the salvation (or is it the distraction) for these SoCal kids. Hill gets the most out of his mostly no-name cast: the only established stars are Katherine Waterston (as Stevie's and Ian's mom) and, even better, Lucas Hedges, just outstanding in the smaller role as the abusive older brother Ian. Sunny Suljic, whom we first saw in ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" has a break-out role as Stevie, and surely we will see lots more from him in the years to come. The movie features, not surprisingly, a ton of great music from the 90s, and as an added bonus, the original score, as sparse as it is, is courtesy of Oscar-winning NIN's Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross.""Mid90s"" premiered at last month's Toronto International Film Festival to immediate acclaim. It opened this weekend here in Cincinnati, and I couldn't wait to see it. The Friday early evening screening where I saw this at turned out to be a private screening, as in: I was literally the only person in the (200 seat) theater, much to my surprise. No matter, if you enjoy a high quality indie movie, you could do a lot worse than this one. I readily recommend that you check it out, be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",Mid90s

16,Pairic,Excellent debut feature,8,17 April 2019,"Mid90s: A coming of age drama set in 1990s Los Angeles which is far edgier and darker than is usual in this genre. While Stevie (Sunny Suljic) looks like Kevin from The Wonder Years, an undersized 13 year old, his life is somewhat different. This mid-90s Summer will be a time of trauma and taboo breaking for him as he is introduced to drink drugs and girls. Stevie is bullied and beaten by his dysfunctional older brother Ian (Lucas Hedges) his single Mom (Katherine Waterston) can be overprotective in ways but ignores this abuse. So Steve seeks the companionship of kids who hang out at a Skateboard shop.The life of an aspiring skateboarder ain't easy, especially when you have to learn from scratch. Some funny scenes as Stevie begins his faltering practice on the board, many falls. He soon fits, the new guy, it means the youngest member of the gang, Ruben (Gio Galicia) moves up a step, but Stevie soon becomes the favourite of the charismatic leader (and skateboard shop worker) Ray (Na-kel Smith), making Ruben jealous. Fights, drunkenness, drug use, all of these have an effect on Stevie and enrages his mother. But these kids aren't evil, they talk to homeless people, they worry when some overuse drugs or drink too much. Smith is especially convincing in the role of Ray, role-model, mentor guardian.This Summer of decadence isn't presented as an idyl or an ideal lifestyle, the consequences of crazy behaviour is illustrated all too well. But neither is Mid90s scaremongering or moralistic, it just lays out the realities of a certain time and liminal space. Director and writer Jonah Hill has delivered a worthy first effort. 8/10.",Mid90s
17,masonfisk,"THE SKATEBOARDERS ARE COMING, THE SKATEBOARDERS ARE COMING...!",7,6 November 2018,"Jonah Hill's debut film as writer/director is an admirable piece of awakening. Feeling like an offshoot of Larry Clark's seminal 1995 film Kids, Hill takes a page from their playbook to chart the fascination of a latch key kid from a broken home (his brother beats him & it seems there is no father figure while the mother is off doing something) who falls in w/a gang of skateboarders who take him under their wing & give him a crash course on the bad things in life (drinking, smoking & of course skateboarding) which gives him a sense of purpose & belonging. An impressive list of needle drops are heard on the soundtrack (I picked out The Pixies, Bad Brains & The Mamas & the Papas to name a few) coloring the background of this low res effort which is a nice stepping stone for future efforts. Good work.",Mid90s
18,truemythmedia,A Slice of California as a Kid,8,11 September 2019,"The film opens with Stevie's older brother wailing on him. I'm not talking the normal brother on brother rough housing. I'm talking a call-child-protective-services style beating.There are a lot of laughs in the film but this is solidly in the drama/coming of age category. And it is no slouch in that genre either. I'm not usually a fan of coming of age stories but this one is pretty unique. Maybe it's the 90s nostalgia working its magic on my childhood but it really got to me in a way I didn't expect.One of the reasons the film works so well is the acting. I don't know who any of the main kids are but they have an authentic quality that is missing from 90% of the films that come out in theaters. In fact, this whole film feels like it was shot, not with actors, but just normal kids doing what they do.The way Stevie relates to the other kids and the way their inter relationships work is very authentic feeling as well. The movie is full of the sort of friendships you have when you are that age: simultaneously admiring, hating, being ashamed of, and being controlled by your friends who are sometimes not so friendly.This is my favorite aspect of the film. As much as I liked ""Eighth Grade,"" it does suffer from a sort of binary, this-kids-a-good-kid and this-kids-a-bad-kid syndrome. People just aren't like that usually. In ""mid90s"" each of the kids is good and bad. At times they are cool to Stevie and at others they aren't. Sometimes Stevie seems more like an audience member, just watching the older boys establishing pecking order, partying, and skateboarding their hearts out.The film rings so honest and earnest that it clearly comes from a heart that grew out of this era before cell phones and fear of letting kids just hang out on their own all day. In fact it doesn't shy away from showing exactly some of the reasons we don't let that happen anymore.In the end, I feel remarkably satisfied by the story and the themes in this film. Sure, the cadre of teens huffing it around town on their boards may have their problems but Stevie learns, or maybe doesn't but we the audience do, that growing up is as much about growing into who you are as it is about growing your first societies.He could have grown older just staying at home with his family but growing up means joining societies other than your family's, complete with their own rules, morals, and rewards. Stevie gets his first taste of this in mid90s and helps us all remember what it was like to dip our own toes into that water for the first time ourselves.",Mid90s

(R)Young Suljic seeks respite from his troubled home life by ingratiating himself into a pack of older skater kids. Coming-of-age drama doesn't break ground so much as relive past snapshot glories (literally and figuratively); nostalgic, but it eschews rose-colored shades for tougher truths and uglier fall-outs. Hill, making his directorial debut (he also wrote the script), shows confidence, if not much originality, preferring to ""attack"" the material as a laidback but observant witness, echoing early Richard Linklater and Larry Clark's ""Kids"" (that film's writer, Harmony Korine, has a cameo). Much of the cast is comprised of non-professionals (and it shows), but they bring a rough-around-the-edges authenticity that couldn't have been achieved by up-and-coming stars. Soundtrack captures notable tunes of the era (Pixies, Wu-Tang Clan, Nirvana, Morrissey, etc.), though it's curious that the era's so-called ""skate punk"" of Strung Out, NOFX, et al, was ignored.70/100",Mid90s
23,martimusross,Watchable but Vacuous,5,26 March 2019,"This movie sought to capture in time both a specific time period the mid90's and a specific moment in a young boy's life growing up at that time.It did not pretend to be anything more than what was on the tin and on that level it was very convincing and achieved its goal.Looking more closely at themes, namely finding your place in the world in a rough neighbourhood, on the street, where every bad option is before you was less convincing.There was just insufficient substance to drive the narrative, it alternated between documentary and stream of consciousness in almost real time.The central images of hopes and dreams around a skateboarding gang, as almost surrogate parents to a needy child, just didn't cut it and thus the pace of the movie became baggy and lost focus.Lastly it really had no ending or redemptive conclusion so ultimately is was unsatisfactory for the viewer. Did we care what happened to Stevie, ultimately no, we couldn't give a tinkers toss.",Mid90s
24,rivertam26,Impressive debut,10,11 May 2020,"What an impressive debut by Jonah Hill. This slice of life drama is reminiscent of Kuds but not as horrifying. Set around a young boy desperate to fit on with someone and pushed away by his brother. He discovers skateboarding and a complex group of kids. He's introduced to drinking, sex and drugs in some truly disturbing scenes. The one flaw the film has is that it never really delves into the plight of its characters, never really fleshing them out fully. Still want stands is a truly intriguing period piece that feels very genuine. At times it can be a hard watch but it's well made with solid performances especially from Sunny Suljic in the lead and the always amazing Lucas Hedges.Budget: $1.7m

25,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,Very well-made indie cinema deifying the 90s.,9,3 September 2020,"Mid90s is Jonah Hill's love-letter and confronting examination of a decade we now look back upon with incomparable admiration and respect. It's got everything: skateboards, VCRs, Super Nintendo, Sony PlayStation, Ren and Stimpy t-shirts and gangsta-culture. It's a time-capsule movie that truly doesn't feel like it was made in 2018 at all: its setting and characters are that convincing in making us Belgrave we're back in the 90s. Sure it's not all sunshine-and-bunnies in the story: the main character suffers physical abuse from his older brother and his mother isn't the most accepting person on the planet, but the movie's exploration of camaraderie, sex and drugs and rock and roll, VidCam filmmaking, skateboards and no longer feeling like an outsider makes Mid90s quite the visual and story-based treat.This film is a short and ridiculously sweet nostalgia trip for anyone wanting something simple, relatable and honest.",Mid90s

29,aciessi,Da Bomb,10,30 October 2018,"Where were you in 1996? I was infant, having moved from my first home in Yorktown Heights to my grandmother's house in the south end of New Rochelle, waiting for our new house to be built and for my younger brother to be born sometime in October. For Jonah Hill, it was a little something like Mid90s. A Richard Linklater-esque throwback to the days of Mortal Kombat, Bevis and Butthead, gangsta-rap, baggy jeans and endless summer days of the eternal skateboard. Shredding up and down the block without a care of oncoming traffic. The 90s, admittedly were a time that seemed carefree for most American kids. Jonah Hill takes us back to that time with a semi-autobiographical film that managed to impress me more than any film I've seen yet this year, and fill me with nothing but nostalgic love.If you know what the phrase Cinema Verite means, you'll know it precisely applies to Mid90s. Nothing pretentious or overly thematic about this film. It's so scratchy and authentic that it even feels like a documentary film made from this era. We follow the life of Stevie, played by a breakout star in Sunny Suljic, a troubled kid who constantly gets ragged on by his moody older brother Ian (Lucas Hedges) and overly protected by his preoccupied mother (Katherine Waterson). His life is miserable. He finds no escape in his only refuge away from the outside world. So instead, he jumps right into the world of the skate-rats. He befriends Ruben, Ray, Fourth Grade and Fuckshit... yes, that's his name. Druggies, alchies and other miscreants who shred by day and chill at night. Even in this period piece, I found similarities by these characters and many of the people I hung out with and went to school with. Don't lie to yourself, you've all met someone like them. Stevie suddenly becomes just one of the guys. He gets into all sorts of trouble... and that's what this film is all about. Trouble, the good kind. Chilling with your boys and making unforgettable memories.In that sense, it's barely a period piece. Any person can relate to this as a coming-of-age story, and as minimal as some of the anecdotes depicted here may sound, it's the way Hill brings it to life that counts. He's a natural born director. He has a whip-crack knack for telling stories. He seems sincere and passionate about telling this story. I hope we see more of him behind the camera, as much as we do in front.This film is hella dope, to coin a phrase from the Mid-90s.",Mid90s
30,RforFilm,"If theres a trick to landing growing up, then Mid90s did it great",10,29 October 2018,"For most of us growing up in the 1990s and early 2000s, one clear memory is the rise of skateboarding culture and it's place in school. Along with punk/grunge rock helping set the mood, I still recall the baggy pants and sounds of the little wheels grinding against the pavement, carrying a skater hopping to be as good as Tony Hawk or Bam Margera. Though there are a lot of people, especially kids that get into it for a passion, a lot of it revolves around the antiauthority that it rolls around; skating where their not supposed to and treating the urban and suburban landscape as their skatepark. It's a tamer version of feeling an adrenaline rush.The reason I bring this up is that while I was never a part of the skating crowd, I did find culture fascinating and even fun. Heck, I still wear Vans shoes as my casual footwear. A lot of people try to find an explanation or a meaning behind it, though I can only say it's a lot like any hobby; it's an escape from whatever mundane life were living. Skateboarding is so much about the gritty, bare bones aspect of life that even the filming around skate videos tend to me minimal. First time director Jonah Hill understands this in his debut, Mid90s.Somewhere in Los Angeles, adolescent Stevie (played by Sunny Suljic) lives with his single mom Dabney (played by Katherine Waterston) and abusive older brother Ian (Played by Lucas Hedges). He's also shy and seems to have little friends. He becomes intrigued by a group of older kids skating around a set of stores. He follows them into a skate shop where he befriends close to his age Ruban, in which is then introduced to the rest of the group, Ray (played by Na-kel Smith), Fuckshit (played by Olan Prenatt), and Forth Grade (played by Ryder McLaughlin).The kids in this group are far more grown up, engaging in drinking, smoking, and even trespassing. It doesn't take long for Stevie to be going along with these vices, along with adopting whatever mannerisms the boys have in order to seem like ""one of the pack"". In the process of encountering good and bad moments, Stevie starts to see that despite his problems, it could always be worse and that everyone will have a different answer on what it takes to be a good friend.Mid90s reminded me a lot of Boyhood and Ladybird; this is another slice of life movie. What does separate this is this feels much grittier then your typical style of story. This isn't afraid to show several of these kids drinking or even engaging in their first time sexual encounters (off-screen, but it still has that same impact). With the focus on Stevie, he's just as capable, but he's never doing it for the sake of being bad, but rather that he's simply being a kid who wants to be seen as cool. Like any kid growing up, he does try to do better.Thanks to the performance of Sunny Suljic and the other kids, I get not just a sense of understanding, but an eerie cloud that reminds me that even though I wish kids didn't live like this, they do, and I remember seeing those kids. Again, they do bad things, but not for the sake of harming anyone. It's all about making do with what they have. And having gone through this experience of a movie, I have to ask; would I have done the same thing if I was in this kids shoes? Possibly.
Jonah Hill clearly wanted to emphasize this, by making the movie just as gritty as it's story is. Even the film's ratio aspect is like an old skate video that I might have seen in those stores that showed the same footage for ambiance.I will warn that this earns it's R rating in full. There are a lot of unpleasant moments that I won't spoil, but all add on to this slice of life that I can see easily happing to kids, even today. That's part of the intention of Mid90s and wants it's audience to understand that being an adolescent requires making dumb choices in order to grow up.I'll give this ten skateboards out of ten. Mid90s is so authentic that I swore that I could smell the hot asphalt that was being skated on. It'll ride and grind through friendship and even if it doesn't land completely steady, it lands regardless. This is definitely one of my favorite movies of 2018 and cannot recommend this enough. Landing a grind is hard, making an ollie is hard, but growing up beats all others when it comes to the hardest trick. There's no answer and has to be felt. Mid90s needs to be seen to be felt so go see this.",Mid90s
31,Ruskington,A solid piece of nostalgia with some notable individual performances,6,19 May 2020,"A pretty decent directorial debut from Jonah Hill. The writing is solid, the cinematography quite powerful in a bleak kind of way and the acting from these relatively unknown kids is extremely impressive. It provides a very accurate portrayal of nineties teenage life that at no point feels contrived or embellished. The story itself is interesting enough to keep your attention but not enough to stick with you afterwards. While I wouldn't be in a rush to watch this again, I will certainly be excited to see what Hill produces in future.",Mid90s
32,kjproulx,A Home Run for Director Jonah Hill,10,20 September 2018,"It's fascinating to see certain actors and actresses try their hand at writing or directing, because you never truly know what to expect from their first outing. This has been a very surprising year in that regard, seeing John Krasinski's masterful work on A Quiet Place and Bradley Cooper's upcoming rendition of A Star is Born. That being said, I truly don't believe an actor/actresses will be able to top Jonah Hill's film Mid90s for quite some time, in terms of going from acting to directing. When a film can come out of nowhere and be hilarious, shocking, heartfelt, and realistic, all at once, then it's an immediate winner in my eyes. Coupled with the numerous things that this movie has going for it on and off the screen, this is the movie of the year in my opinion. Although the year still has quite a few films to go, I have a hard time believing something will impress me more than this film has.Not having the greatest Mother, being bullied by his older brother, and just wanting to fit in, Mid90s focusses on young Stevie (Sunny Suljic) as he strives to stay as far away from his home life as possible. Wishing to fit in with cooler kids than the people he has grown up with, he meets a group of older kids at a skate shop. They grow to enjoy his presence and an unlikely friendship sparks between him and this group, but it's not all sunshine and rainbows. Although he has a blast hanging out with them and cracking jokes, this film explores the harsh realities of being responsible and what drugs and alcohol can really do to someone, especially when you're young. The evolution of most of the characters throughout this film is really something to see, and at a mere 84 minutes, this film is pleasantly well fleshed out.Going into this film, I expected certain things out of Jonah Hill's direction and I was not disappointed. Yes, those who have experienced his roles in movies knows that he can be the most hilarious person in a room, but also deliver dramatic performances that have now given him Oscar nominations, so I went into this movie hoping for him to have placed both of those extremes on-screen. Mid90s is one of the funniest movies I've seen all year, and while the first half of the movie is simply there to amuse audiences, there are many set-ups being made for a darker second half. The evolution of this film is absolutely fantastic from start to finish. The way Hill directs these performers is truly something else, but that's also due to the fact that this is a very well-cast film in general.Sunny Suljic is a real force to be reckoned with. Having this much talent at such a young age is a very rare thing, but he resonated with me completely. The way the friendship between Stevie and Ray forms is absolutely brilliant. Na-kel Smith brings a lot more to the table than what I expected after his first few scenes, but that was clearly intentional. His character is the most mature of the group that Stevie hangs out with, which works in favour of giving life lessons throughout the course of the movie. When looking back on this movie as a whole, from the comedic first act, to the character development throughout the second act, and even to the dramatic moments throughout the third, I found myself in awe that this was directed by a first time director.In the end, I truly hope Mid90s receives the attention that it deserves this year. I can see this movie getting a lot of love from critics and tons of buzz when awards season kicks into high gear. From the very raw and real screenplay to the incredible score by the great Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, to the overall messages throughout this film, Mid90s is as entertaining and funny as it is dramatic and eye-opening. I loved every second of this film and I can't recommend it enough. This is easily my favourite film of 2018 and one of the most memorable theatre experiences in quite some time. Saying that about an independent film that only lasts for 84 minutes may seem crazy, but I couldn't be more honest about that statement. See this film.",Mid90s

34,maccas-56367,Jonah Hill's directorial debut is fantastic,9,8 May 2020,"This felt like Clerks turned into a coming-of-age skateboarding movie. It worked well. Hard to believe Jonah Hill was first-time directing here. You could feel the passion and enthusiasm for this project throughout.I would later find out that many of the actors here had little to no experience acting before too. Amazed, because they all deliver really solid performances. Perhaps more importantly for a film of this type, their performances are incredibly authentic and believable. You feel part of the gang very quickly.There are some hilarious scenes, along with some more emotional and powerful scenes. Mid90s features a phenomenal soundtrack and uses music well to help create atmosphere.I'm a 90s kid, but I couldn't relate to much of this film. It certainly captures the feel of 90s culture and films though. I think it's best to remove any expectations going in - because it's quite a unique film that stands on its own two feet among the coming-of-age genre.It felt all over way too soon, but was immensely engaging and enjoyable. Makes me want to play Tony Hawk Pro Skater. I look forward to seeing more of Jonah Hill's directing career!",Mid90s
35,ThurstonHunger,Authentic affection for Mid90's,7,10 January 2021,"Hill's affection for that time/place/attitude is authentic, and ultimately I think that carries the film. That along with the acting he gets from the youths, many of them non-actors but not non-skateboarders, keep things engaging.I'm pretty old (I can recall when skateboarding was known as sidewalk surfing) but I can still watch at-risk kids and not feel parental heart-tugs or grumpier get-off-my-grass reactions. It helps that Hill does not despise his young cast like some other auter directors. One might argue he cares a little too much about them, but not I.There was probably a lot of stress on Jonah to make his first film, well not some dumb comedy or homage to other greener, purpler grass. I suspect many of know kids that you kind of are amazed survived their childhod, maybe Jonah is among them, but I look forward to what he directs next.",Mid90s
36,Alexander_Blanchett,Almost perfect nostalgic trip back to the 90s,8,23 December 2018,"A true journey back in time. Director Jonah Hill really managed to bring the mid 90s back with as many details as possible and was able to really create such an authentic atmosphere with it. You could really smell it. Good job. Besides being a nostalgic trip back to Mr. Hill's and also my childhood this film serves as a great coming of age picture about fitting in... feeling the desperate need to fit and .... not fitting in at all? Its good because that is something a teen really gets bothered about... that and at least in the mid 90s... skating. You know what I realized while watching the film? Nobody really skates anymore... and no kids really get out anymore... sure we also had our Nintendos and everything... but we went out... hung out... for the better or worse.
Jonah Hill's trip to the past has not much of a plot... but he has a great set of characters. First of all we have Steve who is very well played by Sunny Suljic. He really embodies the teenage angst of that time and really portrayed the development of his character nicely. The best performance however came in my eyes from Na-kel Smith. He really had a great monologue scene in the second third of the film. A great idol-like figure for all the characters and the true good soul. A surprising and great performance. Katherine Waterston was also very good. She deserved more scenes but she was excellent as the careing mother.
I did not like Lucas Hedges. First of all Jonah Hill failed a little bit with his character as he needed way more devlopment, second... Hedges was really miscast for it and gave a really poor performance (did he really like try to deepen his voice when he talked? Like .. Batman-like??!)
Other than that its a very, very good film with a great atmosphere, characters you really care for (I really would love to see what they do today..) and a banging soundtrack.",Mid90s
37,cliftonofun,A new look at something pretty familiar,6,3 August 2019,"This film wants to be about more than it is. The characters and scenes both come off as genuine - an accurate portrayal of a certain subculture in a certain era. Plus, Jonah Hill seems to have a way with the quieter moments. BUT the story is not exactly new, either. Whether fiction or non-fiction, we have covered this territory before...this story feels kinda like the lovechild of Boyhood and Dogtown and Z-Boys. Nothing about it seems original, but there's something fresh about it nonetheless. It is a new look at a familiar moment. I'm kinda curious what Jonah Hill does next...",Mid90s
38,rdoubleoc,Felt like the 90s.,7,27 April 2019,"I was born in the early 80s, so in the 90s I was a teenager, and this movie painted an accurate description of the era. Jonah Hill does a good job of this.I actually had a Ninja Turtles Skateboard that looked almost identical to the one in the movie, although in the movie it wasn't branded as TNMT. I'm pretty sure that's what it was meant to depict, though, and one kid in the movie even makes a comment about it, saying it might as well say ""Cowabunga"" on it. My mom bought it for me when I told her I wanted a skateboard, but that's not exactly what I had in mind, much like the kid in the movie. My childhood was kind of like the movie -- boring. The movie really felt like the 90s, though, and like I said, painted a good picture of the era.It's not particularly thrilling, but it is mildly entertaining, and is an alright movie overall. Not a bad watch, but don't expect too much or you might be disappointed, but I don't mean this in a bad way.",Mid90s
39,ronakkotian,"If you grew up through the 90s, this would be a nostalgia fest",7,28 March 2020,"The reason I wanted to check this film out was because of Jonah Hill. It's interesting to see actors give a shot at directing, writing or even both and for a first feature, Hill doesn't disappoint.Mid90s follows Stevie, a young kid with a troubled family life, and finds a group of friends at a skate shop during the... mid 90s obviously.If there is one thing that's executed extremely well, then it's the authentic feeling of the 90s when you watch it. The film has 4:3 aspect ratio and revolves around skateboarding, teenagers, drugs and many more aspects which attribute to the 90s feeling. This film is clearly very personal to Jonah Hill because of how realistic it looks. I really liked the music choices since it amplified the 90s atmosphere even more. It's blatantly targeted towards people from that time period and I'm sure that group of people will find this movie extremely nostalgic. Hill's script is very enjoyable and quite humourous at times. The characters were really fun to watch and what made them believable were the performances by the actors.Sunny Suljic did an incredible job especially as a child performer. He had a lot of range in his acting and played the role to the best of his ability. Na-kel Smith, Olan Prenatt, Gio Galicia and Ryder McLaughlin all gave terrific performances especially considering that fact that all of them haven't acted much before this. Even Lucas Hedges did well as I thought he suited the role.Whilst watching the movie, it reminded me a lot of Larry Clark's KIDS and I'm sure that film was a huge inspiration to Jonah Hill but it kind of made Mid90s lose some of its originality. Also towards the end, the editing became messy. There was a scene that included somewhat of a jumpscare that I didn't like at all.Mid90s is nowhere near flawless but I respect the amount of work Jonah Hill put into his directorial debut. It's a fun, nostalgic and personal trip coming from someone who's lived through that time and wants to share his love for that period to everyone.",Mid90s
40,statuskuo,Mid-Life,7,8 September 2019,"Most of us who were teens who grew up in the 90's often forget how busy we were with living a mundane life with no social media nor internet. It was all about creating our own fun with house parties, drinking and smoking. I imagine my teens would've been similar to these kids had I lived in Los Angeles at this time.
The main character...Sunburn, a kid who lacks playmates his own age runs into a group of skater punks who adopt him like a stray. Since his own homelife is dodging beatings by his older brother or sidestepping his too young/makes poor decisions single mother he needs to find an outlet. He desperately wants to belong. And so it unfolds as a slice of life film about the time when you truly nosedive into teenage angst. Poor family.
Now, for those who compare this to ""Kids"" I'm not sure I draw the same conclusion. This is a naive, sweet kid who searches for a ""tribe"" ""Kids"" seems more like a nihilistic storm of pent up misdirected hormones and anger. At being poor or being neglected. Truly self destructive behavior. This film illustrates a willingness to grow up past the reckless good times. While the lens is seen with nostalgic glasses, director Jonah Hill also sees the background of the hoodlums and paints it with a sense of tragedy that their lives will get worse if it ever gets any better. Not necessarily by their own undoing but their environment. There is no plot to speak of...just mini-tests for the kid to pass only to realize how much more privileged he may have been and, in a very touching moment with one of the other skater pals...to understand what gratitude means.
Though it isn't going to excite the modern crowd who've sand blasted their attention span with the internet, it was captivating to watch. I don't hold the 90's in that high of regard...but I do hold the people this way.

44,baileycrawly,What a Mess!,2,29 June 2020,"Mid 90s is a film that had potential. Being written and directed by Jonah Hill who, while never the greatest actor in the business, still seemed to be able to justifiably give the bare minimum required for every performance he gave, and telling a story inspired by his own upbringing, this film could've been a moving coming-of-age story about getting mixed in with the wrong crowd, winding up involved in some severe issues and rising above it.
Instead we got a young, innocent kid getting into smoking, drinking alcohol, swearing off to his parents, having sex with a girl who looks to be quite a bit older than him (and then retelling the event, in graphic detail, to his friends). Essentially, what you got was a guidebook on becoming a thug in the hood rather than an inspirational (or even entertaining) tale.
This film has no plot. In the sense that it's inspired by Hill's own upbringing, that would make sense (life, after all, has no overarching plot) but there's a reason why stories aren't presented in the media exactly as they occurred. This story needed sensationalism to make it entertaining. Instead, presented as-is, we're given with an absolute headache.It's not all bad, however. The acting talent behind the film was decent and they really helped to make a bland and underdeveloped script a little more watchable. The decision to shoot the film in 4:3 instead of widescreen was also interesting and added character to the film, drawing you into the simpler time when the film took place.However, the rest of it was an absolute mess. Can someone please tell Jonah Hill that a proper film has a plot, and subsequent scenes and activities that lead up to the climax of a plot? Because this isn't it.",Mid90s

Losers just hanging out? Perhaps it was needed for some audience.I know some people like the slice of life films, like American Graffiti, Almost Famous, Dazed and Confused etc, but nothing really happens in those movies.

Highly impressive cast and an overall natural, improv feel to the acting style. Very cohesive look to the film (grainy, muted gray cast) and editing style-it looks 90s and the pace feels like a chill skate film. Many good scenes and a winning dynamic between each of the characters. But less in the way of plot and an arc that feels complete. The ending is definitely sudden.""Mid90s"" definitely has something strong going for it, especially in the lead acting of the young child actor Sunny Suljic.

The advantageous addition of Jonah Hill's exquisitely sincere, ghetto, 90s atmosphere also, bolsters in producing one of the most sympathetic and charismatic movies of the year.

They are amazing. The friendship that is built throught the whole thing is awesome in a weird and different way. Mid-way through it you just thing the kid is gonna get down to a bad path (or even die), and the guys didn't care at all about him, but they do, and you can start seen hints of that in the story.The only real issue I could highlight is that sometimes it feels like some scenes doesn't really have a conection, and the story isn't following a actual path. Even at the end, you still feel that some things could have being wrap up appropriately. One still can argue that this is the movie's goal all along, but still.8/10",Mid90s
51,harrylosborne,Simple cinema done honestly,7,26 December 2019,"I have a soft spot for coming-of-age films, especially those tackling suburban American life; ""Dazed and Confused"" and ""Everybody Wants Some!!"" give me the same nostalgic twinges that I believe the respective directors were trying to convey. Jonah Hill's directorial debut tackles the difficulties of a thirteen-year-old trying to find his niche in an LA summer, and finding solace in a group that shelters him outside a fractious home life. As the story progresses, you can see the emotion infused into the story: it feels personal, and not a linear script to be performed and forgotten.Mid90s is somewhat rough around the edges, but this is a quirk that the film manages to carry off. The actor for Stevie (Sunny Suljic) is a young star still finding his feet, but in that respect is more authentic when playing an impulsive, irrational teenager. His eagerness to please alongside a youthful naivety is refreshing to see, not a sanitised impression of how a child would really behave. The dynamic of the group that takes Stevie in is perhaps most genuine aspect of the feature - they swear, they rebel, and they truly embody the spirit that Stevie wants to adopt. Stevie's abusive older brother Ian (Lucas Hedges) is arguably the most polished performer, who treads the fine line of unhinged and compassionate more carefully than more senior actors can.Each character adds an important dynamic to the whole of the group, but they rarely overstep one another. Their passion for skateboarding is what connects them, and through that they deal with the trials of growing up, whilst off-screen also struggling with their personal issues. The imagery of a skater's LA is striking: there are few locations Stevie holds dear (a skatepark, a shop's interior, his driveway) and they feature heavily throughout the charted summer.Mid90s is somewhat unrefined and I can accept that, but its diminutive charm still shines through. The script is not revolutionary, the cinematography not groundbreaking, but it does the simple things well, and still tells a story well enough to merit watching. Ultimately, the message is inconsequential, but that doesn't mean you won't enjoy the ride.",Mid90s
52,foxtografo,A good film,6,8 August 2019,"It's quite a simple story, not very eventful, just this group of kids hanging around, and skating. There's some background on them, but not really much, it's more their interaction. Which is fun to watch, and it feels really natural.
The acting is good, the cinematography is not the best of the movie, but it makes sense that Hill decided to film it in this format to make it more retro.
It just doesn't develop much, I felt a bit like something more could have happen, but I'm still happy with it.
Enjoyable film, even if I wasn't into this stuff when I was a teenager in the 90's, I still appreciate the culture references and some of the music.",Mid90s
53,scb_coldsteel,"Good, but flawed slice-of-life presentation of the 90s.",7,17 February 2019,"So I finally got around to renting Mid90s on redbox. I was a bit apprehensive about seeing this movie since Jonah Hill was a first time director tackling a difficult subject. Overall though it's a solid first attempt at film making and a decent, but flawed film.The plot of the movie simply follows a young impressionable boy as he attempts to fit in with a group of skaters. Don't expect any grand narrativesthis is a very bare bones documentary-style presentation of the subject matter. That's not a bad thing necessarily, but at 75 minutes the film kind of runs out of original ideas pretty quickly.Over the course of the movie the film acts both as a coming-of-age morality tale and a slice of life case study on 90s skateboarding subcultures. The film doesn't really have an overarching narrative and much of the film is populated with the ramblings of adolescent boys trying to one up each other. It was pretty fun and did really capture it's subject matter well, but lacked quite a bit of depth.The biggest strength of the film really dealt with the 90s setting. Similar to films like Boyhood Mid90s acts as a perfect time capsule for young millennials. I had quite a bit of fun just picking out familiar cultural artifacts from my own adolescence. Plus the movie put a lot of care and love into depicting skateboard culture from that era.For a first time director Jonah Hill did a solid job. The movie had a very small budget, but worked around that with a gritty documentary-style presentation that captured the spirit of the story. Plus all of the young actors and their dialogue felt very organic. I will watch anything with Lucas Hedges in it right now. They may not win any awards, but they genuinely felt like a real group of young boys sitting around and talking.Throughout the film I couldn't help but think Mid90s was doing its best to be a modern day Kids. It had the exact same setup and structure, but unfortunately lacked the brutal and stark realism of Kids. Mid90s seemed to pay tribute to Kids, but didn't have the tenacity required to make a hard-hitting morality story. It all felt very shallow and almost like a after-school special near the end.Another aspect which really hurt the film was a complete lack of character development or any real conflicts in the story. Subplots and characters were introduced but never fully utilized. The movie was so short, but really I felt quite bored halfway through and really lost interest in the characters. While yes the dialogue felt very natural, watching a group of children sit around and make sex jokes just couldn't hold my attention.I appreciate what Jonah Hill was trying to make here. It was a loosely narrated film that was supposed to act as a homage to 90s skateboarding culture. Unfortunately the movie ultimately felt shallow and seemed too obsessed with its own content. Instead of acting as a critical case study like Kids, Mid90s just didn't have a lot to say. A 6.75 out of 10.",Mid90s

56,arabnikita,Jonah's big hit,7,14 February 2019,"I have never liked skateboarding and I didn't grow up in 90s LA and to be honest I didn't even read the synopsis of the movie before watching it. I watched this because of Sunny Suljik who portrayed Atreus in God of War and I was curious about Jonah Hill's first written and directed movie.From the cinematography and camera work to the dialogues and music this movie oozes the 90s vibe where being ""Cool"" is the most important thing for a child. Jonah's writing gave the kids room to improvise and that infused this short film with humanity to create a complete plot with characters experiencing real problems and emotions without being excessively dramatic. Almost felt like you are observing real people and not actors.Sunny does not disappoint in his story and acting. We can see the desperation to fit into a new group and the way it ends up impacting his life. The best part is that it is clearly a phase for him and once summer is up, he will move on. There aren't unrealistic cliches of self discovery; just a simple story about family, friends and ways in which the people that surround you influences your life.Dont set your expectations too high.

Noone is painted black or white. Characters feel grounded and real, rough kids with rough backgrounds trying to get away from it by skating and hanging with friends. I think the movie excels at putting yourself into their mindset. And the overall vibe of the movie just really nails it. the early skater culture being presented in this movie is fantastic.That said the movie isn't traditional in the sense that it has a defined payoff or anything, it really doesn't. Inching to that documentary territory. But the end didn't have me fully satisfied sadly, I think it was a bit rash and quickly thought off as the character choices didn't completely make sense to me.Solid 7+, very enjoyable and even more so for skaters.",Mid90s

63,joshbarton15,Jonah Hill certainly has potential as a filmmaker.,8,20 March 2019,"With every actor in Hollywood seemingly making the move to work behind the camera these days, Jonah Hill becomes the latest with Mid90s, a coming-of-age drama that certainly shows Hill has potential as a filmmaker.Stevie (Sunny Suljic) is a thirteen-year-old who lives in 90s era Los Angeles. During one summer, Stevie navigates life between his troubled home life and a new group of friends he meets at a skate shop.The best thing about Jonah Hill's Mid90s is the authenticity of it all, from the way it's shot to look like a product of the 90s, including the production design and costumes, right through to the narrative aspect of the kids just hanging out and skating, a rarity nowadays as kids would just be glued to their smartphones.The narrative jumps between Stevie's life at home with his family and out on the streets with his friends, the contrast between the two being pretty damn striking. At home, Stevie is abused by his older brother for pretty much every little thing and his mother who feels a little smothering towards him. Out on the streets skating is where Stevie finds escapism from his home life, avoiding the police and chatting up girls in the process. The tagline ""fall. get back up."" is pretty much how Stevie lives his life, either at home or on the streets, making for a viewing experience that feels so natural following the life of a teenager in the 90s, when the pressures of social media didn't exist. It would make a great double-feature with Eighth Grade.Coming to the performances, Mid90s is pretty grounded and it compliments Hill's film. There's no need for caricatures here and Sunny Suljic does a great job leading the film with his performance as Stevie, capturing the innocence of a child at such an age. Lucas Hedges plays Stevie's abusive big brother Ian but there's much more to it than him being abusive, Hedges conveying this rather well.Jonah Hill's directorial debut most definitely isn't groundbreaking and may not be to everyone's taste, some of the dialogue feeling like it's been ripped straight from Superbad however, it does enough to make me look forward to what Hill does next as a filmmaker.",Mid90s
64,Camoo,Good effort,6,1 March 2019,"Mid 90s did not remind me too much of the 90's. Nor did it particularly make me want to go back to them. This is probably an unfair way to start a review, but I feel like any film about my favorite decade needs to at least make me want to re-experience that decade. By the end it seemed the 90's concept added nothing to the film or the story or anything beyond the initial idea itself being pretty neat.The story is a basic coming of age yarn about a kid from a broken household who yearns to fit in somewhere, and in his case that somewhere is a clique of vacant skaters who inhabit a downtown skate shop and basically do nothing of interest throughout the entire film. I'm not against vapid characters in films - they're characters after all- but I just wish that they were weighted into something better drawn. And then there's a vague sub-plot about his abusive brother and absent parents, which is supposed to supply the motivation to this kids dereliction, but end up simply underwhelming elements to an already thin storyline.An oddity of the skater world is that a skaters style has not really evolved since the mid-90's, not beyond Wu tang t-shirts nor baggy clothes or caps anyway, so it becomes a strange place to spend the entirety of a film set in the 90's. It could easily have been set anywhere at any time and it wouldn't have mattered and I would barely have noticed aside from a few obviously placed references. It was only really at the end, when scenes on hi8 and fisheye lenses appear, that I started to feel a sense of time period, but even that felt more a gimmick than a necessary element.This film has its charms, and a couple great moments and some solid acting, (particularly by Katherine Waterson and Lucas Hedges) but overall I found Mid 90s weak, lacking in daring and energy. The dialogue is thinly strung together, the characters shallow, and most of it comes across like a failed attempt to summon the bedraggled spirit of Larry Clark. I was also hoping it would be funnier. Its best moments come when the film mixed its tone with brushes of surreal comedy.Also Trent Reznor's monotonous score brings it down for me to a point where I found whole sections of the film languorous and cold.Jonah Hill is a talented fellow, I give him that, but overall the film feels an inauthentic attempt to create 'authenticity', in an emulated style that was already perfected in the 90's. Unfortunately it misses the opportunity to add something fresh to what has already been said.",Mid90s
65,domtaylor,"It's engaging and often effective, but the lack of character lets it down.",7,3 May 2019,"'Mid90s' is not always a comfortable watch; it's honest, raw and unflinching. It manages to successfully engage throughout, despite its limited narrative, and is a convincing look at a 'slice of life' from the Mid 90s. There are also some very tense scenes, the cinematography is great, and the score is good, too. While the performances are all decent, however, there is little character work here and this severely affects the piece. While we do care about the lead characters, there is little room for growth or development, which somewhat leaves you wondering what the point of the film actually is. Arcs are established for some of the core players, but the film ends before they have been completed. It's only 85 minutes long, and it feels it. This is somewhat disappointing because it could have been a bit longer, wrapped up the arcs and felt like a more complete story. You could argue that Hill didn't want to tell a complete narrative, though, and that he was instead aiming to just take a snapshot of these characters' lives. He does this successfully as it feels very realistic and is quite affecting, but it's a shame that the characters aren't as fleshed out as they should have been, as this would have only improved the experience. Its primary goal, however, seems to be to recapture the time period, yet this feels like such a small part of the whole thing. It is obviously set in the 90s, but the wider story doesn't feel exclusive to that period, and there is little in the way of producing nostalgic pleasures. Despite its problems, though, a lot of 'Mid90s' worked for me and I was engaged throughout. It is also rather affecting in places and, while there have been several films very similar in essence to this one before, Hill crafts a solid directorial debut that is definitely worth a watch. 7/10",Mid90s
66,svhot,"""Mid90s"" is a modern masterpiece movie, great acting, excellent direction",8,18 January 2019,"Wow, ""Mid 90s"" is such a nostalgic delight. However, it is much more than that. Very few movies manage to portray human nature correctly and honestly ; this movie excels in doing this in quite a balanced way. Human beings are a product of environmental conditioning and complex genetics. All of us are not born and raised equal in terms of wealth, family values, physical looks, intelligence, natural talents and skills. Therefore, all of us keep trying to ""fit in"" using one method or the other. All human beings have a good side and a dark side. This movie presents and portrays all these themes almost perfectly.The main reason this movie has been successful in conveying all these themes is because of writer-director Jonah Hill's outstanding writing and brilliant direction. I still have a difficult time believing the fact that this movie is actually Jonah Hill's directorial debut. The main actor, young Sunny Suljic , can definitely become the next Leonardo DiCaprio (if given the correct roles and movies in the future).",Mid90s

68,tresm87,Jonah Hill transports us back in time with this solid anochronistic coming of age drama/comedy.,8,22 December 2018,"7.8/10. Honestly I was quite surprised just how well Jonah Hill captured the mid 90s teen skater timeframe represented in this film. While I do think that he forgot to mention a lot of the metal/grunge/punk phenomenon surrounding the skate scene at that time, the LA hip hop aspect was portrayed well for the era. Also the 90s skate companies on the t shirts they were wearing and the various skate decks they had were all accurate for the time. It doesn't focus on the skateboarding aspects as much as I thought it would but the dramatic story that it tells for this young boy trying to become part of the skate scene was an intriguing story to watch. I thought Sunny Suljic was fantastic in this and very authentic and believable. The dialogue is a little hit or miss at times and ridiculous but most of the time it does work in its own weird way. You can definitely see the trademarks of Jonah Hill's brand of comedy throughout the film. There were raw and truthful emotions captured throughout which was a nice touch and made it more convincing. It was also pretty cool to see him shoot the film with a 90s camera style and it definitely adds to the experience. It is a very short and to the point story, but I think he accomplished what he set out to do and he did it well.",Mid90s

This is to say that I may not have much of a recollection of life in the mid 90s. But I wasn't born yesterday either.The film seemed interested in appearing real and it just didn't seem real to me. But worse of all it didn't seem very interesting either.Most of the dialogue was fine. The way a few of the relationships and scenes developed were fine and occasionally good. The cinematography was fine. The 4/3 aspect ratio was ok and served a purpose although it didn't seem necessary. And the older skater characters could clearly skate. That's about all that was good about the filmThe biggest problem was that there didn't seem to be much of a point to the film. The main boy, his brother and his mother all seemed to make inconceivable decisions and have inconsistent motivations. The older brother was a jerk one moment and nice the next moment. And the younger kid never seemed to bother complaining about the issue. Also there was no real arc to any of them except perhaps the mother. And her arc was more infuriating and annoying than likable. She changed her mind about the skaters after seeing thrombosis display regret after almost causing major irreversible damage by driving drunk. I didnt find that arc very fulfilling.Also the mother was the smallest character between the kid, his brother and the mom, which made her character as the only one with an arc particularly strange. I also didn't really like the kid, the brother as characters. I found a couple of the skaters interesting and believable, even if they were appalling. But I only really felt sympathitic and connected to one of the skaters. They were mostly a pointless or detrimental bit of the narrative too.The film in a lot of ways had the independent film vibe of showing missable people living their miserable lives. It's like their goal is for us to learn that miserable people can't learn anything and maybe we shouldn't expect them to learn anything because they're miserable and had miserable stuff they couldn't overcome and shouldn't have had to overcome. And the point of relearning that is........?It's possible to make a fictional story which seems authentic and also worth investing one's time within. This film didn't fit that description.It seemed to be a film which was almost as bad as The Florida Project from last year. Both stories are never constructed to come off as interesting. Probably because they'd rather resemble an original idea and a good ideas and wouldn't want to make the viewer feel hopeful that awful people could overcome their awfulness. It's not that I'm against a tragedy. I like quite a few of them when they are done right. But when your tragedy doesn't say anything interesting, the tragedy becomes the act of watching the film.",Mid90s

74,dmasursky,Worth seeing but keep your expectations low,6,28 October 2018,"There is a lot to love about this film. The actors are very natural and very engaging. The star, Sunny Suljic, is quite a find. There are a number of very moving scenes between the characters - we all have our burdens to bear.The skating is great, but there isn't tons of it - don't go to the movie expecting it to be Lords of Dogtown or something like that. These boys hang around, talk smack, and do a bit of skating.I have a major and a minor complaint about the movie. The minor one is what I thought was a really gratuitous scene between an older girl and the main character, Stevie (who is supposed to be 13 years old, but he looks younger, and the actor playing him IS younger) - we don't actually see them fooling around, but he talks about it (graphically) afterward. I thought the actor (and the character) was awfully young to include that. Why not something more sweet, more appropriate? It definitely affected my feelings about the film and my willingness to recommend it to others.The major complaint is that there's just not enough ""there"" there. The movie isn't even 90 minutes long. I think if you're going to ask your audience to spend $12.50 at the multiplex, you should give them something substantial. It feels like the first HALF of a great movie. Jonah Hill introduces so many relationships and characters that never really get addressed: the mom, for example, and especially the brother - what's his deal? And the tension between the two friends who are moving in different directions seems defused by a terrible car accident caused by the one character's drinking. Are we supposed to think that all is forgiven? It just felt very unfinished, very unaddressed. I felt a bit cheated and I almost felt like Jonah Hill was just lazy, or couldn't be bothered to flesh out the film and do the work to complete it. I would certainly have a hard time heartily recommending the film, though it has some powerful moments. A fine first effort, I suppose, but not quite what I was hoping.",Mid90s

77,MK_Ultra_,Amateur hour.,3,1 March 2019,"Jonah Hill passes along his Hollywood days and decided to make a film. Now... my guilty pleasure, regardless of director, has always been the ""coming of age"" film.Not unlike the many that delve into this genre, a few do shine, whether its the connection to something portrayed in the film that you can relate to, strong writing, a soundtrack that captures the time, character development, decent acting, or a story that you connect to in such a way that it becomes ""your story"" that you may actually sit in front of multiple times and revisit the feeling you got the first time you watched the screen.The formula of at least three of these factors usually makes a decent subgenre film. A collective makes a classic.This film has none of that. It tries hard, but ultimately it ""tries too hard"", and the film slogs along like a cliche' tropefest. Think: an afterschool special perhaps.This is a one time viewing to see what the buzz is about, and sadly, the inability of the reviewers to separate the 1% gold from the 99% of the garbage shown by these bloated reviews is mindblowing.This is not in the realm Linkletter, Korinne, Hughes, Coppola etc. This falls into a tier well below these directors' output. Hill tried, a24 tried, and on the other sideof it all, the self indulgence of making ""Jonah Hills first film"" is the only thing that comes through.Hill is a medicore actor lastly, so maybe there is something for him behind the camera? Very well could be, but we can all learn from our mistakes (mine being...watching this film based on ratings).",Mid90s

Many of us had this dilemma before, either choosing a more conventional path of studying, sports, extra curricular activities, or simply becoming a hoodlum, which we all know will end in a criminal life in the future.I personally connected with the character, because my family was quite similar, and there were those situations that in order to fit in, you have to change your slang, your clothes, and beat up someone to earn respect. I saw the ""Sunburn"" character as an alternative version of myself, how would my life be if I chose the streetsmart path?I think the movie is very reflective, showing sometimes how young and imature we are when we have to make those choices that will impact the rest of our lives.",Mid90s

The film delves into the ubiquitous skate culture of the 1990's replete with all the trimmings, including Discmans, WWF buddy pillows, and Big Brother magazines.Hill took inspiration from other street culture movies that were actually made during the period in which this film is set, most notably Harmony Korine's 'Kids,' though 'Mid90s' is far less visceral and provocative, which is to be expected considering Korine presumably has a chapter written about him in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.Though a handful of scenes would've played out better had Hill chosen a slightly older actor to play the lead, his camera work is top notch and the film picks up steam along the way, resulting in a pleasing and somewhat evocative debut.",Mid90s

However, the ending messes the movies flow. It happens so abruptly and it goes back to this slow pace, and everyone is depressed. Then, they pop in this compilation of happy and feel good moments, and its a very strange way to end it. I didn't get it and it grew on me a little, but all in all its a little out there. The times also the big brother beat up the main character, whenever the main character screams or anguish in pain it felt a little forced. Sometimes it even felt too forced, however aside from those times I got the message fine.

He does some mistakes but he eventually finds real friends.We can feel that he's a weirdo from their POV at the beginning, but he learns the codes, he learns skateboarding, and he begins to replace another kid in his coolness, wich is really upset about it.This movie shows some hardships like the kid feeling obligated to do crazy, dangerous stuff in order to look cool, and all of this feels very real and honest.It might could have been longer though, with a shy 86 minutes count.This movie is filled with clever idead to represent the evolution of the relationship between him and his new friends. There is not much dialog but the editing makes up for stares and complicity. Also the aspect ratio is 4:3 which reminds us of VHS format. Even the grain is 90s-like, just enhanced to be watchable from a 2018' audience.
The acting is so natural if felt like a social documentary.
All of this scales up with nice Hip-hop sounding like Tony Hawk's OSTs.I especially like the last scene.

The movie shows very well with which problems you struggle as a teenager. In retrospect partly trivial stuff. At that time, these were the central issues.You don't really relate to the characters, you rather feel triggered by the events or addressed by the characteristic or behaviors of individual characters. You think to yourself, I have experienced similar things and you know how the guys must feel.When I saw the movie for the first time I was flashed because I didn't know what to expect and it doesn't lose its impact with repeated viewing.

94,BestBenedikt,Decent directorial debut with a few problems,6,7 January 2019,"While Mid90s is certainly a decent directorial debut, Jonah Hill's intentions of bringing as much 90s nostalgia to the screen as possible, while on the other hand delivering a compelling drama, just didn't go together that well.Especially in its first half the film primarily comes off as an idealization of 90s pop culture in general and skater subculture in particular. This feels odd at times, since the main story evolves around a boy trapped between family problems and bad influences coming from group pressure, while he desperately tries to fit in and be cool - even if all of the actors did a proficient job portraying these troubled characters.The score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross also worked quite well in the beginning. But the longer the runtime, the more did the overuse of music feel uneven and distracting - especially regarding the soundtrack. It again seemed like Jonah Hill tried to cram as much 90s feeling into his film as possible. Speeking of 90s feeling, the whole look of the film with its heavy use of natural lighting is something one needs time to get used to.Overall, Hill did a decent job directing this film, even if at times he obviously couldn't handle the loose narrative of the script and the intertwining of nostalgia and drama.",Mid90s

98,ninjawaiter,Probably Authentic but Utterly Pointless,4,14 September 2019,"Maybe if you were a hardcore skate-kid in the mid 90's this film will take you back. That seems to be the consensus of a lot of other reviews: that it is a time-capsule, like catching a scent that suddenly transports you to some earlier time and place in your life. And if that works for you, terrific.To me this was a film about a bunch of idiots doing idiot things for essentially no reason, utterly lacking in plot, conflict, or anything else to make it engaging. Maybe that was the point? Being a skate-kid was pointless and stupid, so this is a film depicting pointless stupidity? I'm guessing at the filmmaker's intentions, not making an assertion about skate-kids, so don't get your boxers in a twist. I was the same age as these kids, and nothing about this recalls my adolescence.Obviously given its lack of a plot or central conflict it is also utterly lacking an ending. It picks up at a random point, follows a bunch of random events, and then ends abruptly at an equally random point. Very unsatisfying, but that's what you get with a film with no plot.What I'm wondering now is, why 125 minutes? That's not a cliche ""this film could have been 90 minutes"" complaint, it's an honest question. Why 125? If we're both starting and ending at random points in a random series of events, I wonder what made them choose 125 minutes. Why not 130? Or 120 for exactly 2 hours? I guess I'm just curious how that decision got made in the cutting room. Since nothing in the film is important (because there isn't a plot that requires specific elements to remain cohesive), how would one even begin to decide which scenes to keep and which to cut? Ah well, the world may never know.",Mid90s

The breakout stars of this film are Sunny Suljic and Na'Kel Smith. The humor in this film is natural and not forced. The moments of cringe and discomfort are well executed. The emotion behind the film is heartfelt. Christopher Blauvelt's cinematography is phenomenal, and it does a great job in capturing the zeitgeist of the Mid-90s.

101,SharkByteAudioProductions,"A raw, honest and charming coming of age skateboarding tale",9,11 June 2020,"Jonah Hill's directorial debut is short, coming in at just over 80 minutes but it really nails its coming of age delivery in a raw manner. Mid90s wants you to connect with misguided youth of the summer and I definitely saw the positive comparisons drew to Shane Meadow's 'This Is England' series.Speaking as a 25 year old, I didn't see much of the 90s but I still have a nostalgia for that period and especially a connection towards culture that spawned from it.The cinematography is effective with some great transitions and variation and the original score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is understated but used very effectively during transitional scenes.What is fantastic is that this film captures the era perfectly - the film's distorted analogue visuals, the well selected licensed soundtrack (featuring plenty of east coast hip-hop), the accurate blossoming skate culture and nostalgic pop culture references. However, it also captures the negatives of hyper masculinity, casual use of homophobia and toxicity of peer pressure without holding back.My main issues with the film is that a couple of scenes seemed a little bit out of place and a few more skateboard spot scenes wouldn't have gone a miss. A bit more female representation would've also been nice despite its male centric focus and maybe an extra 10 minutes of run time could've helped this.It wont be for everyone but those looking for a decent skateboard focused movie won't go unsatisfied.",Mid90s

I even found myself laughing out loud at some of the exploits because they were genuinely funny. Being a tad older than these kids in the mid 90s' I knew and befriended a few skater cats and they were cool, laid back teens just like the film portrayed. But they were (as we all were at that age) foolish at times. As far as Jonah Hills directorial debut goes, it seems he didn't have much of a ""hands on"" directing style and the acting/adlibs suffered for it. The writing was sub par...not really going anywhere, and that was apparent after the first 45 minutes so I lowered my expectations so to speak. But overall I found myself enjoying the film at parts e.g the ""gap"" jumping scene and the ridiculous idea of a 10/11 year old child scoring with a 13/14 year old young lady just struck me as funny because it wasn't totally implausible back in those days.

It's a simple slice of a young man's life without any glossing over of the rough spots, such as they are, this isn't Kids.It's not a perfect film, almost no film is, but it's honest and provides a real feeling of formative years and the silliness we get up to.",Mid90s
105,chasemykleby,Comedy spiked with touching gravity.,8,9 March 2019,"""Mid90s"" Review
(8/10)Jonah Hill doesn't appear in a single scene of Mid90s, but you can feel his presence in every scene of this comedy spiked with touching gravity. Making his directing debut with a script he wrote himself, Hill shapes this coming-of-age tale, by letting atmosphere, character and glimmers of feeling take precedence over narrative thrust.
You'll find proof positive in the hilarious and heartfelt movie, set to a rock and hip-hop soundtrack that predates the digital age. The film feels rough-hewn and hands-on as it tracks Stevie (Sunny Suljic), a naïve, lonely, unmanageable 13-year-old who's having trouble balancing his life on the fringes of Los Angeles. His older brother, Ian (Lucas Hedges, scary-good), bullies him violently, a fact Stevie keeps from Dabney (Katherine Waterson), a single mom and part-time hooker who appears as rootless and troubled as her two sons.
mid90s is light on plot but heavy on character. It's a hangout movie of sorts, but Hill's original script imbues the story with plenty of drama and an engaging, surprising character arc for Stevie. Despite the sunny aesthetic and good-times had by Stevie's new friend group, there's an undercurrent of tragedy running throughout Mid90s. Hill dials it in just right-a glance here, a knowing nod there-so that when the film finally starts to reveal some of the heartbreak inside the characters, it's all well established. Everyone is broken, everyone has their own baggage. This is a hard lesson to learn at any age, but feels especially tough for Stevie (who is 12 but looks closer to 10). In a way, Mid90s is a film about kids raising kids-even Stevie's mom is lacking in the maturity you'd potentially find in some older mothers, but that doesn't mean she loves Stevie any less.
The performances are the beating heart of Mid90s, and a massive amount of credit goes to Hill's direction. Aside from Suljic, the other main characters are played by non-professional actors. You'd never know it, as Hill draws an honesty from each performance that shines through. These characters feel alive.
Jonah Hill knocked it out of the park here in his debut, he was able to craft something that's entirely his own, with a specific but motivated style. And while it's quite intimate and small in nature, it certainly bodes well for his future as a filmmaker. I am excited to see what's next for him.",Mid90s
106,dogmaticdogs,Excellent Film,9,27 October 2018,"First off, the soundtrack is amazing. Second, the acting is superb. So good in fact, it actually feels like a documentary.I grew up with the skater kids, and it was an honest portrayal. Often misfits and somewhat broken, but usually loyal and just searching for a place where they can fit in and escape from some of their problems in life. Very few writers and directors can portray human psychology accurately. Usually characters are just portrayed as good or evil, rather than a product of complex genetic and environmental conditioning with both a good side and a dark side. People are not born and raised on the same playing field in terms of health, love, wealth, support, intelligence, attractiveness and opportunities. Most try their best but often fail or make mistakes. As a result, judgement of others is absurd. This movie captures all of that beautifully.Sunny Suljic is going to be a superstar. At age 13, he exudes both genuine kindness and humbleness, as well as being able to simultaneously convey an edgy darkside. He has already surpassed many actors 30 years his senior.",Mid90s

The acting by these kids was superb, the sound track was great, the cinematography/editing fit the nostalgia of the time period. This film was obviously heavily inspired by the classic film Kids. That is not a bad thing and Hill's film is at the same time unique, he is also pulling inspiration from his own life as he grew up immersed in skate culture. There are only a handful of films I have viewed more than once, and this film will be added to that select group.

The film is a love letter to the nineties, the production is great and you really feel that time.
The film is far from perfect, in addition to not being able to sympathize with the protagonist, the film in some moments exaggerates too much in the situations and the script shows that it does not care much about the secondary characters, such as the protagonist's brother, who in certain moment is completely forgotten by the plot and the mother, who had a good dramatic potential to be worked on but is totally wasted.Mids90 is a good film, it has a very good direction, hard-working actors and a captive story, but suffers from a great waste of characters and a protagonist difficult to care.",Mid90s

I do feel like the ending could have had a little more meat to it - it was a few weeks in the life of the characters - so while I did want a little more at the end it didn't ruin the honesty of the film overall.

124,esweet-154-191260,An eight for capturing the period and awesome first time out for Jonah,8,29 October 2018,"I have a bias, I grew up skateboarding. We never matched the cool of dogtownZ but shared in the friendships that intersection of boards and youth delivered. Jonah has eloquently captured the rights of friendship and the shared awkwardness we all felt dipping our toe into new waters during or after school. This is a film where you drop in, ride along for a bit and then drop out, hence the No Country for Old Men references that pop up in other reviews. Where this differs is the storytelling, it's a personal shared story of Jonah Hills own youth. One that isn't terribly unique, just honestly told thru the consistent eye of a boy just finding his way into adulthood. The freedom of boarding, the wee hours of the night spent on the Boulevard, the desire to spend hours learning a new trick, trying out stunts with your friends and all that skate culture provide a fulfilling backdrop to the main characters emotional journey. Like Kevin Smiths films the movie is about being young. Mid90's is about the kids that might hit up mall rats for beer buys, 90's kids are just younger enough to simplify their plot lines to peer friendships versus budding relationships. Don't misunderstand, there is plenty of boy girl relationship included, but it's sideline to the boys finding their way interpersonally. For us skateboard kids the movie hits home, for the Non-skaters it's a great story with great punchy and fitting humor woven throughout and riding on the back of the culture of the mid 90s themselves. Them movie feels real. This is not a movie about shredding empty swimming pools, it's about being a kid for a time. Its about peers helping friends out with a new board or trick, it's about acceptance and honesty. It's filled with feel good and that's welcomed given the socioeconomic and political,climate that greets us outside the theatre doors. This is a good film. It's feels simple, almost independent, but if you pay attention you'll witness Jonah and his director of photography were paying attention as well. We are provided some nice action camera angles, enough POV footage to get what skateboarding is all about, plus there are many shots that look well crafted cinematographically with either the luckiest of found lighting utilized under a masterful technician or the crew spent some time crafting the shots. Like No Country... the film simply ends. It's appropriate when it goes black but nobody in the seats was ready to leave yet. The young actor had just reached a stride, he is accepted, things are starting to happen for him, he is in that place where you no longer worry about not fitting in and are no longer cautious of what you might say wrong, you know the field of play, you're part of the group, your friends have become your young adult family. The movie goer has enjoyed some laughs, some drama, some concern and your just feeling that everything is turning out ok and then...darkness and credits. Every actor delivers something, nothing is wasted, nothing is missing. This is the sort of movie that ten years from now we'll be seeing big leading roles for many of these kids. I saw it in a barely filled afternoon theatre sitting and everyone was laughing out loud. I can only imagine how much more effective a full house would be. A great way to end the summers viewing. Highly recommend the film, Jonah, if this is what you've got from attempt number one, I can't hardly wait to see what you bring us next! This was crafted from love without the pressures of big studio. It's that freedom that lets the story be told the way you wanted it to be told. I will be buying the DVD for the home theatre experience, PS fantastic soundtrack.",Mid90s

127,Joetampa90,"Larry Clark's ""Kids"" if it was a good movie.",8,2 November 2018,"When I first saw the trailer for this movie months back it was hard to not see some similarities from Larry Clark's teenage slice of life movies from the late 90s and early 2000s. Once I saw the movie I was pleased to see while some parts may be influenced by Clark, the Mid 90s stands on its own as true winner.Much like Clark did, Hill has brought in some kids who have no acting experience here to play Stevie's crew. They all really knock it out of the park and add to the sense of realism. The film is short and sweet setting up the main points quickly and then taking some great turns, some of which are a bit dark. I was a big fan of Lucas Hedge's character and how the dynamic of him and Stevie plays out. The soundtrack also is really quite amazing and adds a lot to the film in some scenes. Also Mid 90's may have the best jump scare of the year!Some people may complain that while the film does have good characters, setting and so on, it lacks a standard plot. While this is true I'd argue that it sets out to tell the story of Stevie in a realistic fashion and gets the job done. While Mid 90s does have some shortcomings like some cliches and some heavy predictability, I didn't feel like they hindered the film much. A strong 8/10.",Mid90s

All I know, is a great movie makes you feel what they feel. And this movie did exactly that. Great cast of non branded actors that did an excellent job. ! Great casting of them. Great writing! Great directing. Great sound. My only criticism would be lighting. I always ponder why some movies are filmed so dark. We get it, it's a ""dark"" mood.

Then it started to slowly come together. I'm not saying this is the best of the genre or ground-breaking cinema. I'm saying this film has gems of merit that make it worth a watch. By the end I was all in.The characters are lifelike, as in real. The actors are weak and actually help the characters come to life. I know that sounds weird but have a watch and I hope you'll agree. There's everything to hate in this film if hating is what you do.Our lead, Sunny Suljic, is working his ass off right now, as he should.

131,BlueFox94,Mid90s: Teen Spirit Thrives in Jonah Hill's Directorial Debut,7,7 December 2018,"(Originally published on the Impacting Culture blog)""You literally take the hardest hits out of anybody I've ever seen in my life. You know you don't have to do that, right?"" - Ray (Na-kel Smith) to Stevie (Sunny Suljic)Potential spoilers belowA common adage heard in every writing class is ""Write what you know"". Such advice is crucial for first-time filmmakers. Included in that category is the 34-year-old Jonah Hill. Hill has ascended from acting in risqué comedies like Superbad, Get Him to the Greek, and 21 Jump Street to award-nominated performances in Moneyball, The Wolf of Wall Street, and War Dogs. Such experience now encourages him to step behind the camera with Mid90s, a capsule look at the laid-back yet reckless world of his youth. A somewhat bare and heavily mature slice-of-life anchored by Sunny Suljic's lead turn, captured on 16mm film like a quaint CRTV, and featuring an eclectic soundtrack of urban deep cuts from the era, Mid90s serves as a solid first step on a new path in Jonah Hill's career.13-year-old Stevie (Sunny Suljic) suffers quietly through his turbulent home life in 1990s Los Angeles. His young single mother Dabney (Katherine Waterston) rotates through men in search of a stable love life. His older brother Ian (Lucas Hedges) inspires Stevie with his late '80s and early '90s pop culture merchandise and memorabilia, yet he also torments him (as older brothers do) while butting heads constantly with their mother. Stevie becomes fascinated by, and soon befriends, a group of skateboarding teenagers, including leader Ray (Na-kel Smith), ""F.S."" (Olan Prenatt; initials used here stand for real in-movie nickname, which combines two major obscenities), ""Fourth Grade"" (Ryder McLaughlin), and Ruben (Gio Galicia). Now dubbed ""Sunburn"" by his new friends, Stevie enters a world of excitement as well as danger.Writer-director Jonah Hill lists as inspiration for Mid90s works such as 1995's Kids, 2006's This Is England, 1999's Ratcatcher (debut of Lynne Ramsay, who helmed You Were Never Really Here from earlier this year), and even 1993's The Sandlot (F.S.'s nickname reminds one of Sandlot's ""Yeah Yeah"", played by Marty York). All those movies, despite their diverse time settings, were made through the lens of concurrent '90s and early 2000s pop culture. Recent works like Sing Street, It, and Ready Player One served as more fond emulations of '80s pop culture. Mid90s, meanwhile, comes off as a pioneer in confronting the reality of '90s America as an urban wasteland, burnt out by '80s excess and filled with kids yearning for fulfillment - or at least, new ways to pass time - through risky adventure. It was no mistake that extreme sports like skateboarding made their breakthroughs in this decade.Yet while the skateboarding lifestyle alone suits most, some like Na-kel Smith's Ray consider the possibility of skating as a career. To Stevie and the rest, he embodies the lifestyle with skill and style. Ray did not, however, become group leader (sans nickname) because he was the dumbest, the laziest, or the most reckless. It was because he was himself without fear. He also sees his friends without overlooking their fatal flaws, recognizing that they might be holding him back from a promising career as a professional skateboarder.As Stevie, Sunny Suljic (the son in The Killing of a Sacred Deer) makes for the ideal blank slate for receiving these insights from the supporting characters. Ruben stands out early as the one who brings in Stevie, giving up his status as the ""young kid"" of the group and thus the very thing to help him become the center of attention. Hill, d.p. Christopher Blauvelt, and editor Nick Houy (Lady Bird) call attention to Ruben's jealousy for Stevie well at first, yet Hill decides to stick primarily to Ray's effect on Stevie soon afterwards, leaving little for Stevie to digest from the rest. His mother Dabney struggles to connect with Stevie, yet she surrenders him to his friends. His brother Ian offers blunt advice from a position of superiority, which is all he has given his apparent and odd lack of friends. Lastly, while F.S. parties hard by himself, Hill could have connected the timid Fourth Grade's interest in filmmaking to the surging independent cinema scene of that time. Divesting some of Ray's observations to the other supporting characters confessing themselves to Stevie would have given Mid90s additional balance and fill.Perhaps this restraint will confine Mid90s to a hidden gem status in later years. Hill's debut, despite the realistic and era-accurate adult content packed into its 84-minute runtime, is comforting compared to the compact yet electrifying tension of Gustav Möller's debut The Guilty from earlier this year. Hill succeeds most in pioneering the naked and cynical gaze back towards that decade sandwiched between '80s excess and the internet-driven '00s - a decade cherished by many (including this reviewer) as an unforgettable pop culture gold mine. Moreover, he accomplishes this in the same year that he stars in Netflix's Maniac and gives yet another Oscar-worthy supporting performance in Don't Worry, He Won't Get Far on Foot.May 2018 serve as a launchpad for Jonah Hill and his collaborators to rise to further artistic success, both in front of and behind the camera.(Parental Note: Mid90s has been rated R by the MPAA for ""pervasive language, sexual content, drug and alcohol use, and some violent behavior/disturbing images - all involving minors"".)R.N.B.",Mid90s

""Did people really talk like that?"" Yes, they did!
This film made me laugh and made me cry, it's charming and never ever boring, and it's really brilliant from start to end.
Stevie (Sunny Suljic) is a brilliant character, and the acting is spot on, it's not even like you're watching a film, it's like you're watching their lives unfold. And one character, Fourth Grade, played by Ryder McLaughlin, is supposedly based on a young Jonah Hill, who is the writer and director of this film.
In my opinion, Jonah Hill is a much better director than actor, and it wouldn't be surprising if Mid90s did end up being nominated for awards, because it is brilliant.

I was very wrong.The story is based around Sunburn's entry into the skateboarding community, while at the same time dealing with a bad home situation. The movie explores the importance of relating to a group when you are a young teenager, especially when you have a tough home life and being unable to find a decent role model inside your home. Also, it greatly explores the subculture of skateboarding, which is very inclusive in general, and people in it have a sense of belonging to a family, while at the same time discreetly denouncing the various problems of the skateboarding culture that are way too often glamourized by various medias.A must watch.",Mid90s

However what did happen was completely unbelievable and it left the audience with the nagging question: ""Why?""I will not echo other reviews except to say I agree that Hill tried a little too hard with the t-shirts and music and I really hate to get into nit picking - but as someone who was in my late teens and early 20s in the mid-90s, this film rang hollow. It's like Jonah Hill didn't even try for accuracy with the female characters, in behavior or how they dressed. Their mother was a total cypher. There was literally nothing memorable about her except that she was obviously a horrible parent with no sense of fashion or self-worth and with serious personal issues that went un-dealt with both in the film and in her fictional personal life. There is no way a 16 year old popular girl would want anything to do with a 10-year old prepubescent boy, or that on the off-chance she was drunk or high and they hooked up, there is no way she would ever openly discuss this with her female peers. Like ""Hey guys, I just let a 3rd grader ____ me."" Yeah. Right.Then there is the fact that his mother drags him into the skate shop, screams at the other kids as though she's about to take a much heavier hand in her son's life and what happens next? Well, he spends two or three straight nights in a bum park and partying with his much older friends. Did I mention that the lead actor couldn't pass for 12 years old if he tried? And yet we're supposed to believe that he's just adopted by a group of guys in which only one person is even remotely near his own age, but about two feet taller than him.The failure of this film to incentivize the audience to suspend disbelief was a common theme and it ultimately ruined it for me. It culminated in the post-drunken-driving accident in which a car full of boys was flipped on its side but nobody got seriously injured or arrested. Jesus.Less than 10% of what transpired was remotely plausible - and I think Jonah Hill must have been trying to craft some kind of memoir of the crazy life he wished he had. Why? I have no idea, but clearly there was also a desire to exercise some visual directorial chops with the silly, unoriginal montages that included the closing sequence of the movie. It's like he made this movie ""Because he could.""And while I can definitely say I was ""entertained"" for an hour and a half, I wouldn't risk recommending this film to anyone else without serious qualification. If you have a hankering to see a group of kids do extremely stupid things with zero adult supervision, I would suggest ""Kids"" or even ""Requiem for a Dream.""

It's supposed to be a character study and a coming of age story. He chose to focus on teaching the audience the point of some stuff rather than building the characters and using their actions to prove points Hill himself wants to make. Lucas Hedges in this movie is the most underused actor in any movie ever and he could have increased this movie's rating by 2 stars but hey.I enjoyed the touching relatable moments and the performances but most characters are underwritten and I think the movie fails to realize what it should have focused on.,Mid90s

However ""Kids"" is far more genuinely gritty in adddition to being *actually filmed* in the mid 90s. One scene that really stands out to me is after Stevie has his first hookup at the party. He heads over to tell his buds and she tells her BFFs. It was a flashback to the girl talk scene with Rosario Dawson and Chlöe Sevigny.

I was born in '94 but at least lived the late 90s, but this was like watching a film on VHS--without it though!I noticed a Sony Handycam in the film too, so I pulled mine out after I watched this!

167,TheZombieBehindYou,An incredibly endearing film about childhood and growing up,7,9 December 2018,"Jonah Hill's Mid90s is by far one of the most interesting and best debuts of 2018. I'd genuinely be surprised if he didn't get a directing nom because this film genuinely deserves it. The fact that they shot in 4:3 combined with the shallow depth of field and light coloring really makes it feel like your watching a film straight out of the 90s. After the film ends there's a solid minute or so of skating reels they shot on Super 16 which is really cool.Character wise this film is a mixed bag, a lot of the characters are mishandled but the ones who are handled well are great. Sunny Suljic gives a performance so real and well done I almost forgot I was watching an actor. All of the side characters have a lot of character and depth but sadly don't get much development (outside of the Mom and the brother). I've read some other reviews which people state that the nickname thing was dumb but as someone who used to go to sketchy ass skateparks it's pretty true to life.To be fair the plot isn't crazy or anything but it's incredibly well done. The score is pretty solid even though there's only like four tracks but the music they picked to use in the film is great. The cinematography looks great and it never feels like you're not watching something that could be straight from the 90s. I 100% recommend this film but be warned that it portrays an unflinching look at what life was like growing up during that time.",Mid90s

I'm no prude, but if an 11 year old female actor was asked to act out a sex scene with an older teenage actor there would be a discussion about it. I don't see that addressed in any other review and I wonder why? In a male-dominated culture is any sexual depiction ok if men are portrayed as victors?",Mid90s

172,nosequitur,"Honest, simple, well written, directed and performed",7,28 December 2018,"This movie brings back memories to a lot of 90s kids. Jonah was a 90s kid himself. I'm sure that a great deal of his experience was put to service in this movie. And the result is very, very good.The movie presents a very honest, but simple view of friendship/family back in the 90s. Parents back then were between worlds. Their children were feeling free like they never had a chance to feel with their own parents. Kids just wanted to hang out with friends, but in new, weird ways that were hard for parents to understand. Crossing lines was cool, not just dangerous. Being cool was how a kid went on to belong to certain groups. But to be cool you had to do stuff, like in the streets (trespassing, jumping off roofs, and just be crazy on a bicycle, skate, etc.). Adrenaline sports were getting popular. Online, selfie coolness was yet to come.Focusing on a small group, instead of offering a bigger picture of society, was well thought. Kids had no such big picture back then as they have now. The www was a newborn in the 90s and almost no one had a computer. Some things were really harsh within teens groups (a lot of bullying, fights and older siblings taking advantage of you). However, as the movie shows, friends would also deeply care about friends. And parents who were trying hard enough eventually came to embrace their children's unfamiliar way of growing up.Overall, the cast, the story, and the scenery made everything look authentic. Great debut movie for Jonah.",Mid90s

I did like how we found out later Ray lost his little brother so to understand why Stevie was so easily accepted to the group, although in reality he most likely would need to bail first. Kudos to some of the first time actors in a feature, they really all did a great job. Kind of knew as soon as I seen Fourth Grade with a vid camera it was going to be the ending montage though. I did feel that ending could have said a bit more though, possibly Stevie landing a trick and one of the Pros taking notice, not sure. Overall a great first film.",Mid90s
174,bnitcamela,LOL yeah right. This is supposed to be believable?,2,27 October 2018,"The main character is supposed to be 13 years old. He was 11 when it was filmed and in any remotely realistic universe, he would have had a tough time passing for 10. Yes, he looked that young.But try to forget that inescapable reality as you follow this group of hooligans on their unsupervised adventures through what I guess is some suburb of Los Angeles, some time in the mid to late 1990s. You'll notice a few anachronisms - several 2000s model cars make an appearance - but for the most part, the film does a decent job of setting the scene.The acting wasn't half bad either. I was expecting much worse and I was pleasantly surprised. But that's where the positives end.As mentioned, this movie relies on one too many totally implausible scenarios in which a pre-pubescent kid who looks not a day older than 10 is not only accepted into a group of older, taller and more sophisticated hoodlums and parentless ruffians, but he becomes somewhat of a de-facto leader or cool guy. It's patently ridiculous. Throw in the fact that we get subjected to an *entire* past-his-prime Morrissey song as the two main characters skate through the middle of a busy boulevard and into various city parks and school grounds.I can't believe the amount of hype this movie is getting. It's just not very good. It's mercifully short at a little less than 1.5 hours, and you probably won't be bored, but when it's all said and done, I can't imagine how this merits anything higher than a 4 or 5 on a scale of 10 from any serious adult or film critic.

Where so many other skate films have failed with superficiality, this captures the mood, the drama, the highs and the lows, the injuries and most importantly the reasons behind what made it so appealing to be part of it.If you used to skate, then watch this film for a nostalgia trip, but don't expect an easy ride. Powerful film making at it's best and a brilliant debut Directing from Jonah Hill, who with his equally raw work in Maniac is really starting to show a deep sense of understanding as an artist.

179,VanillaCaramelLatte,Growing up and trying to fit in,6,2 January 2019,"This movie follows Stevie, a 13 year old who lives in what I think it's the suburbs of LA with his single mother and older brother. Tired of his family environment and of being bullied by his brother, he wants an escape. When he spots a group of older teenagers skating in front of a skate store, he approaches them and starts hanging out with them.
Desperately wanting to fit in with the cooler kids, he learns how to skate and starts doing things he wasn't familiar and comfortable with. The group enjoys being with him and they form an unlikely friendship, which is obviously not approved by Stevie's mother and his brother.
The movie reflects on growing up, the future and having goals. It also shows what alcohol and drugs can do to a young person.
I think the main character looked younger than 13, and I found it hard to believe he was actually accepted in a group where only one person was around his age, and the others 17 or so. The bedroom scene with the older girl was cringe-worthy, and when his mother goes to the store to yell at the other kids saying Stevie was never going to see them again, he just came back the next day like nothing happened.
There are movies with similar plots, so it brings nothing new. On a positive note I liked the visuals, the movie looked like it was actually filmed in the 90's. The acting was very natural. It's not a long movie and I didn't get bored, but I feel like it's very forgettable.",Mid90s

They didn't seem to be rich. But as for the movie it was hard to believe this super young sweet kid is making it in his world of bums and alcohol and adult language.

187,GarretCapristo,What's wrong with it?,10,3 March 2020,"The 90's were a time where skating was a get away for people from their lives. Nowadays there are city built skate parks and professional games for it. Jonah Hill did an amazing job displaying how teens were going about in the 90s from running from cops, baggy clothes, underage drinking, drugs, the love life, and of course skating. Each scene in the movie always made me feel some way if that was surprised, worried, laughing, sad. This movie makes you feel a number of emotions but will make you leave with a smile on your face. This movie also inspired a lot of people including myself that if you aren't good at something to not give it up. Another thing that stuck out to me was the soundtrack. A lot of it was rap from the 90s including tribe and tupac but during transitions or scenes with no rap the music always seemed to fit the scene great. I can rewatch this movie and not get tired of it. Always feel the same emotions and get something more out of it the last time I watched it. All actors weren't big movie stars and KILLED their roles. Everything felt so real and that you were there with them. I originally rated this a 9/10 but I spent so long thinking what I didn't like about it. Even from someone's perspective who doesn't skate it still tells an amazing story and makes you feel all the same emotions. Truly one of my few 10/10s. In love with this movie!",Mid90s
188,Zeke_S,A solid Debut.,7,13 April 2021,"Mid90's tells quite a complex story, however, in attempting to do so it can fall short. Yet, it is still a very strong and ambitious debut from Hill, supported well by a very talented cast. I only wish he better used Lucas Hedges.7/10.",Mid90s
189,feelgooodinc,Jonah Hill on the sunny side of Cali,7,18 December 2019,"If the Harmony Korine/Larry Clarke cult collaboration, 'Kids' was the Sun in this particular galaxy then 'Mid90s' is the Moon orbiting Catherine Hardwicke's 'Lords of Dogtown'.*
Jonah Hill kickflips his career behind the camera with this nostalgic coming-of-age skater drama taking place, where else but the eternally sunny California where the troubled 13 year-old Stevie (Sunny Suljic, actor and real-life skater) starts to feel more comfortable in the streets looking for friends than at home with an abusive big brother and a single mother with too many issues on her mind. Understandably. While the aforementioned 'Kids' heavily revolves around teenage sex, Hill maneuvers with skill between well...teenage sex, skating, booze, drugs, fighting and all the bumps and bruises come in the way our little hero grinds. (he doesn't actually do that. Stevie barely manages an ollie {unlike in real life, go check for yourself!})
While it is hard not to compare to its counterparts within the genre it's the little things that make this one stand out. The emotions, actions and reactions between characters feel awfully deep and original. Conversations as authentic as they can get on screen demand genuineness. Making friends is not easy, especially when as desperately alone as Stevie is in the big world yet he stays cool, finds himself among these bigger kids he starts admiring and looking up to. They get to know each other, teach and learn from one another, become friends, play, party, get in and out of trouble together and it is served raw as reality while it is entertaining big time. You will wish there was at least an additional 60 minutes to the movie.
Cinematography is helmed by the acclaimed Christopher Blauvelt who is a) no stranger to the genre as he worked on 'Paranoid Park' before b) knows a thing or two about filming at high velocity thanks to his involvement behind the camera on 'Speed' trying to capture Keanu Reeves at his handsomest. Needless to say he does a great job conjuring up the colours and style of the decade (the 90's...) with some cream on the top fisheye footage included.
Music is responsibly sourced by none other than Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. The Academy Award winner duo is handling this one with ease. The 85 minute runtime is filled with their own melancholic score as well as plenty of attuned gems by Nirvana, Cypress Hill, Wu-Tang Clan, Pixies, A Tribe Called Quest, Souls of Mischief, Morrissey and Omega (sorry Kanye, it's not yours)
Everything seems to fit perfectly well both artistically and technologically. The atmosphere 'Mid90s' creates sucks you in right from the beginning, makes you wish you could skate just to be part of the gang and almost certainly leaves you wanting more.Verdict 7/10
A powerful 7 that is. Jonah Hill does not disappoint on his directorial debut. Visual, auditory and emotional senses fully satisfied. It's a shame we can't go back in time...*difference in size not considered to devaluate quality",Mid90s

It could have been so much more and I think it missed the mark It was slow, dragged on and the ""magic"" just wasn't there.

fantasy stopped and reality started. One memory that stands out to me is
the meteoric rise of skate culture towards the end of the decade and every kid practicing, hoping to come the next Chad Muska or Rob Dyrdek.Whilst I myself never rolled with the skating crowd myself (I was more of a drifter), I found the culture fascinating and fun - to the point it influenced my dress sense as a teen and adult (I still rock baggy jeans and a Converse shirt+hat at 31 - to hell with what others think!!!).Essential viewing for anyone who was a social leper in school!!!",Mid90s

But its good so that its not a typical, happy ending movie, considering that its really well characterized. suljic fits his role really well, its an actual, real kid. again, a story that i would watvh again on a normal day, its easy to watch, thank you Hill!",Mid90s
209,bootermagee,A complete rip off of 'This is England' & 'Lords of Dogtown',4,19 May 2019,"In Jonah Hill's directorial debut, he proves that just because you were born into Hollywood, doesn't mean you should be writing & directing films. As a fan of Jonah's films & projects ('Maniac', 'Superbad', 'Wolf of Wallstreet' etc), I was eager to see the first film written & directed by him. The film starts out strong, and if you were a kid in the 90's like me, there is a lot of memorabilia you might recognize. However, other than a few visual treats for 90's kids, this movie offers absolutely nothing of value and falls flat in the extremely vague & mundane process. Here are the problems I have with this movie in no particular order. Soon after the main character meets the group of boys who will become his new friends, you are immediately ripped out of the 90's when the group is skating down a busy California street, and you notice that most of the vehicles in the scene are from 2010 and later. How hard is it to find vehicles that were made in the 90s? This drastically removes the viewer from any kind of immersion that could have been built up and also comes off as just plain lazy scene creation. Moving on, there is a scene where the lead character Stevie (who looks like he is 10 or 11, pretty sure his parents are lying about his age for roles) is involved in an extremely cringe worthy, unnecessary, & unrealistic sexual scene with an older girl. I had to fast forward this part of the movie. Not sure what the hell Jonah Hill is doing writing/filming/thinking about children in this kind of way, but dude definitely has a screw or two lose to be coming up with that kind of bs. The film continues with even more unrealistic nonsense, a heavily intoxicated teenager decides he wants to drive his friends to a party. The more mature, older and sober friend proceeds to sigh and say ""let's just get in the car"" (which makes absolutely no sense). The drunk teen ends up flipping the car, injuring the youngest boy prompting hospitalization and no one goes to jail, the cops never even show up, basically no questions are asked because that's how the real world works right? I feel like Jonah Hill has no idea how real world situations work, or how actual people behave, or he is just trying to create the childhood that he wishes he had. Either way his attempt to create complex and diverse characters and relationships comes off as a bit lazy & derivative. It seems like he is trying to loosely imitate the magic/chemistry of films like 'This is England' & 'Lords of Dogtown' but unlike those brilliant movies, this one manages to go absolutely no where while completely wasting the time and talents of amazing established and rising stars such as Katherine Waterston & Lucas Hedges. Also, I must note that here is definitely great chemistry and strong acting coming from all of the boys from the group and they will go far in their careers no doubt, but this film offers absolutely nothing to remember and it seems like Jonah just made it because he could with no clue about what he was actually writing.",Mid90s

211,www.philm.dk,Coming-of-age with insight,7,25 February 2020,"Mid90s is shot in the best 90's underground style on 16mm film and contains (far too much) 90s pop music. The time frame and moods are very believable in the film's simple and diminutive choreography. Overall, the cinematic experience is characterized by the simple - and thus all the more surprising. Where the film is at its deepest insight is in the portrait of 13-year old Stevie, as he fumbles into the coveted recognition, with all that it entails of roller coasters. ""Mid90s"" wins a lot from Sunny Suljic's impressively strong lead role performance.",Mid90s

214,elyjahjackson,Damn Near A Masterpiece.,9,9 August 2020,"An excellent first outing from Jonah hill, that truly captures the essence of the 90's. Let's start off with the performances. While it is immediately noticeable that most of these kids aren't actors, evident by Jonah stating that it was easier to turn skaters into actors, rather than actors into skaters, it doesn't necessarily detract from the film, but some performances are not consistent or as strong as others, Reuben (Gio Galicia) for example, but I can't fault them, for this being their first major acting role.It's also easy to recognize, that there is no narrative structure to this film, it just seems to be the kids reacting to the events around them, especially with that abrupt ending that was absolutely awful. It does however have some excellent themes of growth, forgiveness and family. The honesty of this film is what captured me. Not aiming to shy away and not forcing these typical, tropes that you see in coming-of-age stories.I cannot wait to see what Jonah does next.",Mid90s

The era recreated by Mr. Hill was legit. Knowing it was an A24 film, I had some preconceptions about how this movie would turn out, and as always...A24 delivered the shock as promised. However the ending of this movie falls flat as there is no real reconciliation of the main character's dilemmas after the climax and no real direction for him after the story ends (despite this being given to him by another leading character)...leaving me a bit disappointed. He is given two paths in the movie, but we are left not knowing which he will take. All in all, if you grew up in the 90's, or have a passion for that time period, it is worth the stroll down memory lane.",Mid90s
219,DoctorVenkman,Can't believe anyone liked it,2,17 April 2019,Just a truly horrendous film. No plot. No direction. No reason to care about any of the characters. Wasn't nostalgic at all. Literally a complete waste of time.,Mid90s
220,b-suhr01,Like the 90's if you were there,9,13 May 2019,"This movie was the 90's skate scene to a T. The music, a mix of punk, indie and hip hop, the clothes, baggy pants and 2XL tees, drugs, underage drinking, and of course street skating.
If you were there, you know, if not you can experience a time that will never come back. Skating is not the outlaw thing you do to escape your sh!tty life anymore, it's city built skateparks and X games.
That's why this film hits hard. Everyone who was around then had their crew and every crew had the jokester, the pro, the poor kid and the hanger-on who wasn't really good but a nice dude so you kept him. That's what Stevie is in this film and that's why you feel for him.
Jonah Hill has made an authentic time capsule into the mid 90's that feels real and not forced.",Mid90s
221,onefinesixtynine,Should have gone for PG-13,7,4 January 2019,"This was a thought provoking film with some rather decent acting from young talents.
The story does drag on at times, but anyone who has lived a portion of the lives of the characters could easily understand the unwritten words.
The movie wasn't your daily grind, and for that, deserves recognition.
This film, in my opinion, would have served itself better as a PG-13 just on the grounds of being a type of teaching tool for some parents who aren't the best at verbalizing their thoughts and sentiments because I feel the movie, albeit having some darkness, ultimately shines a bright light upon adolescence.
I'd welcome this crew to explore more of their creativity in future endeavors.",Mid90s
222,matt_nulty,"An authentic, coming of age film - nostalgia - social issues - quality production",9,9 May 2020,"An authentic, period-specific film about the struggles many teens go through when navigating through adolescence. Each of the core characters depicted is shown to be dealing with their own personal struggles and social issues -- be it trying to find friendship and acceptance, pursue their passions, or numb themselves to their own harsh realities.The main character Stevie (Sunburn) played his role exceptionally well. This talented young actor really made me feel what his character was feeling. As we watched his character develop we see him deal with domestic violence, seek acceptance and friendship, deal with peer pressure, and ultimately we see what happens to a lot of youths these days, where he tests his limits a little too far, coupled with poor decision making that ultimately leads to some potentially serious consequences.While this is a coming-of-age film about kids growing up, it is definitely not a film for kids. Although there are some lessons to be learned here, ultimately the consequences of the actions taken seem a little too 'lucky' to me - things could have (and often does) ended up being much worse.Directing: 9.5/10

Do they need suntan lotions? As everyone pops their question about the coloured ones, they ask Stevie ""Sunburn"" does he have any. He just says ""What's black people?""'Mid90s' is a beautiful coming-of-age film, which tells the story of a kid called Stevie, discovers and makes a family out of house i.e friends. His discovery of hood, his friendship, his romantic encounter, a hood fight, confrontation of abuse, well, you can say a whole lot of initial years of Stevie. It's gonna be a helluva ""manhood"" ride!After 'Boyhood' from the master Richard Linklater, coming-of-Age films have become and difficult to succeed at the same time as the film was wholesome and relatable to a whole country. 'Mid90s' is nothing short of this too. Although the film deals with the formative years of Stevie, it shows all kinds of encounter a boy could get exposed to during his own formative years, especially for millennials. You can spot neatly arranged audio disks, video games, brawls with a sibling, stealing money from parents wallet. All credit to the writer and filmmaker Jonah Hill, a famous actor, comedian of Hollywood. He made sure every aspect of the film remains authentic and must be appreciated for casting non-actors, who've given an outstanding performance. Especially the lead, Sunny Suljic. Boy, he's gonna shine! The production design was extraordinary. Although the film was in real locations of Los Angeles, the retro look was all over the screen. A special shoutout to cinematographer Chris Blauvelt, who shot the film in 4:3 over a super 16.During its premiere at TIFF, lead Sunny Suljic was watching the film seated beside the director Jonah Hill. As the film was ending, he was holding the pants of Jonah and tightening his grip. By the end of it, he shouted ""This is the best film I've seen in my life"" to which Jonah shouted, ""Thank You"".

The music was terrible, not anything out of the 90's that I've ever heard, even though the 90's produced the best music of many decades. This movie felt like a random montage of YouTube videos about a group of disenfranchised staters. They weren't acting; they were just living an uncomfortable existence addicted to roller skating and ""coming of age.""

A group of teens become friends through their passion in skateboarding and learn unconditional love for their friends while trying to understand life and all the obstacles that face them.Very relatable to any skateboarder and hits home on many fronts. All the characters are relatable or comparable to anyone who's spent enough time at a skatepark. It left me feeling a lot of emotions throughout the film.

I thought they were overdoing it with the 90's references through t-shirts and posters but it starts to feel more genuine as the movie goes on, and as someone in their mid 30's who skated, I was definitely feeling nostalgic.The acting and dialogue immediately feels off because ...they aren't actors. BUT it's not in a bad way.. it's hard to describe. You get use to it and it's actually quite effective. There is definitely chemistry and for the most part the performances feel authentic.It's hard to tell a coming of age story without cliches and mid90's certainly goes there and takes things pretty far in the name of make a directorial debut splash.The character 4th Grader who is the white guy who just hangs with the skaters and films everything, seems to be based on Harmony Korine (apart from him being poor) as homage to the obvious influence of 'Kids' Overall, it's a good movie and a fantastic first flick for Jonah Hill.",Mid90s

I do recommend this movie to be watched by parents before youths under 14 see it. It does have bad influence with drinking, smoking, and bad language.

238,clarij,"Good, but not good enough.",6,14 August 2020,"For starters, it's an entertaining movie. I enjoyed it, it didn't bore me at all, and it's short. The acting is quite good, especially Sunny Suljic's. It's a good story, but it doesn't really deepen the characters.
Stevie's story more or less goes deeper but you don't really understand what happens in his house, why he goes with these new friends. It does not deepen the character of his brother, Ian, you do not understand why he is so resentful of him. Nor do you understand what the mother is up to, at times she worries but at other times you are given to understand that she is not (for example when the man comes out of her room).
As for Ray, he is a very good character for nothing deepened. You don't know why he worries so much about Stevie, but not about Ruben who is almost the same age. They don't tell you much about his life but what he wants is to get out of that neighborhood and make progress. They could have made a very nice bonding relationship between Stevie and Ray, but they didn't. One scene, they spend the night skateboarding together, you kind of see a bond but not beyond that.In other words, it's a good movie, a good story, but it lacked depth. On the other hand, Lucas Hedges is an excellent actor who will go far, and in this movie he appears for two minutes and his character does not have much history.",Mid90s

And we do and know a lot of things that young teens shouldn't do or know.

Naturally, I was pretty excited to see this movie and high expectations. At the beginning of the movie, those expectations unfortunately weren't met, because it seemed as if Jonah just gathered all his Illegal Civ friends, bought a bunch of 90s crap and started filming. Later on however, it gets clearer what story he wants to tell. And even though, the movie is quite all over the place at the beginning, it is still enjoyable to watch.It also takes some time until the characters in the movie become likeable, as they are first portrayed as the usual skaters who don't give a damn with questionable views on life. However, later on one starts to understand why they are the way they are. This development of the characters in fact is what makes this movie great, since this also seems to carry the message Jonah Hill tries to deliver.So, even though my rating may be affected by my biased opinion of Jonah Hill, this movie still accomplishes to deliver an important message and balance it out with parts, which only purpose is to let the viewer have a nice time, just like skate videos usually do. The movie is also carried by its music, which very fitting however. Overall, if you are into skating and 90s culture, you'll probably enjoy this movie.

Fundamentally Creative,10,20 October 2018,"Harldley any spoilers its brief and simple 10/10This movie exposes the life of a young boy who slighty has a tough life at home. While having a troubled home life he simply befriends a group of skaters who see him as a child, yet grow and learn to see him as a real person not just another self loathing poser. Because of this boys sheer loyalty to his new skate crew, his skate pals find a way to love and support him, and give him a sense of acknowledgement. You begin to fall in love with each character as it's so realistically written, almost anyone who lived enough from any decade pre 2000s can relate. This boy begins to understand the fundamentals of deep friendships as well as social skills and close personal relationships. Although you get a glimpse of his terrifying abusive/ terrible home life, it's clear that his family has gone through some hardship. It's because of this backstory this boy has a mission to find a new experience and family. Just like any family, their ups and downs are inevitable. The audience was captured by utter surprise, in a way I have not seen in years, and that's alot to say. Jonah hill has achieved a monumental motion picture that people can't seem to genuinely tell on screen let alone in writing these days. This film is captivating in a sense where is so real you can almost taste, feel and touch each scene. This movie is ""SUBTLE"" with nostalgia so dont get your hopes up.

253,jjlnine,An Impressive Debut for Jonah Hill,9,6 February 2019,"For me, this movie began like many others: a promising indie film with a lot of hype and huge media attention. Jonah Hill no doubt has chops
as an actor, but can he make a great movie? Let's find out.The film, being set in the 90s, had a lot of options in direction. It is a story set around skateboarding and life as a kid in the city of Los Angeles. For a youth, it was a time of exploration and experimentation: kids running around without supervision and finding their way through the life as so. All the characters, including the main character, Stevie, definitely finds themselves in this situation.Hill did an excellent job displaying the freedom and ridiculousness that comes from being a skater at that time and payed particular attention to the inter workings of a crew. It was almost refreshing to see the attention to detail that he had when writing the dialogue and story.The music choice was smart. The characters were real. The setting was great. The story was, oddly enough, that there was no true story. It was as if there were no cameras at all

255,crossedoutdollarsign,Great debut with some wasted potential,6,5 February 2019,"Thoughts on Mid90'sWritten by Brandon Drew Sandford, Feb 4, 2019
I really enjoyed Mid90s but I think Jonah kinda wussed out and didnt go as deep with the story as he could have.All of the characters and their interactions are great, the interactions between themselves are probably the strongest parts of the movie - I enjoyed the character arches but they aren't explored enough.
Most of my problems with the film come from the fact that its simply too short. Its an hour twenty five - it could have easily been two hours, two thirty if he really wanted. it wouldve given the audience grow to like the characters more (I couldve just watched a two hour movie of fudgeshizz and ray having a conversation in the skate shop)
The short runtime causes the pacing to be sort of uneven at times. For example,there's a scene where the kids are arguing with a security guard that goes on for like 5 minutes - and I loved every second of it, but then there are huge turning points that are completely glossed over without conveying the seriousness of the situation. (The car crash and the tension between ray and fudgeshizz come to mind - plus the weird conversation between ray after stevies fight with his brother shouldve been completely rewritten imo)
The ending isnt really a huge issue for me - I think I understand the implications of where each person would end up after the film - the movie couldve ended where it ended, but these scene was only about 2 minutes and then charlie and everyone else only have minor injuries, the characters show almost no on screen change.
The talk between Ray and Sunburn... Ray is trying to show sunburn that they all have problems and that hes not alone, hell make it through and everyone has to deal with their own struggles in life but that if he had the chance he wouldnt change his bull for their bull. Great I love it, amazing message. But some of the examples he uses are sort of laughable - one of the ways he tries to communicate it is by telling sunburn ""Fourth Grade is one of the poorest people I know. He can barely afford socks. Socks."" And I swear I almost started laughing. It just fell completely flat.
was like 'wow jonah you couldnt have just found a way to just show us that he was poor through an action? Wait hes the poorest one but he can still afford a video camera and tape in the 90's?""
""Wait but they said his dad works at the dmv- i know the dmv isnt a high level job or anything, but its still a government job that has to pay decent - what the h are these other kids parents doing to get all this money???????""some of the reactions of sunburn's brother were just straight up confusing.This is more of a personal gripe than anything, but I found the soundtrack to be super unfitting. I'm not even quite sure what Jonah was trying to convey with those spacey tunes as they skated, much of it reminded me of the skating scenes in Paranoid Park.
But the worst part of the soundtrack was that this dude jonah hill really tried sneaking in a Smith's track - that's when I lost it and when 'No no no no no J Hill! That aint gonna fly""
I have no doubt in my mind that the kids in this movie would make fun of people for listening to The Smiths (granted the kids arn't the one playing the music but rather the editing to as mood)
He really could've ripped songs straight out of the Tony Hawk soundtrack and it would've been 200% better.I know this review may have sounded quite negative, but I really liked the movie and I'd highly recommend it and I look forward to watching it again soon and see if my opinions change.
Overall I'm proud of jonah hill, he clearly put a lot of care & passion into this project and is eager to prove himself as a competent director - and he has succeeded in that. But I think he was too afraid of making a flop and trimmed the movie down to its best bits. resulting in an hour and twenty five minutes of great material - that just leaves me wondering where the other scenes are. I hope Hill directs another film and next time takes a few more risks.
If you want a number I think I'd give it a 6
(but the writing and characters are probably an 8)

256,nathansmit,Unbiased Truth and Powerful Performance,10,20 May 2019,"What really makes this film shine is its honest and strikingly truthful portrayal of these friends during this time, not only in their own lives, but the world around them as a whole. It doesn't glorify their actions nor does it denounce them, it simply shows them. Sunny Suljic is a stand out in this film and between this and his performance in ""God of War (2018)"" I'm convinced he's one of the best child actors working today. Lucas Hedges also brings a lot of gravitas to his smaller but impactful role as the older brother.

264,justinbaldrey-83513,"This is the most accurate depiction of a ""skater"" lifestyle",8,11 August 2019,"This is a amazing ( but maybe a bit too short) movie about the lifestyle of a skater. Let me start off by saying, No you don't need to be a skater to like this movie. I personally was growing up, and this movie resonated with me like no other.This film isn't one of those typical ""900 on a mini ramp to win the championship"" movies that skateboarding usually is depicted as in movies. This is a perfectly done setting, perfectly shown lifestyle of the behind the scenes of a skater. The substance abuse, the grind to get that ONE trick, the looking down from society. It's all there.I see a lot of reviews that talk negative about the legitimacy of how young the kid is and how old the other kids are. Saying they would NEVER accept the kid at that age, saying the drugs, the alcohol isn't realistic, that simply isn't true. Many kids at my local park skate every day, look up to these older skaters and everyone accepts them because they are trying to do what every other skater is. I personally even used to hang with a kid who was much younger because he was on our level of skating, and now he's actually passed all of us. And touching on the subject of drugs..... Yes, iv seen many be influenced into drugs, fighting, drinking at such young ages. That movie shows that, it's not promoting it, it's just being realistic.I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who has any interest in skateboarding, and even as a normal viewer I still highly recommend.Also I wanted to add, hats off to Jonah hill for picking such great talent from the skateboarding community to actually be casted and play the roles of these kids.",Mid90s

(Also even if the character is supposed to be a minor, it still doesn't change the fact that the actress is an adult!!)I think the actors were great and I thought overall it was a good movie - or at least what i watched.

Like the movie literally @#$%'s viewers with what is akin to a phallic object made of mid90's memorabilia.The stream of nostalgia literally never lets up the entire film. He has mid90's posters on his wall. He wears a TMNT shirt. In the background of scenes there are 90's sitcoms playing. And so on and so on.Believe it or not, in the mid90s, we didn't always wear mid90s shirts. We didn't necessarily have mid90s posters on the wall. We sometimes watched sitcoms from (gasp!) the 80's. Or sometimes even the 70's.Point is, it just goes too far, such that immersion is impossible. The title should have sent that message with flashing lights, but my own nostalgic blinders likely prevented me from noticing. Who names a story after a time period? That isn't like a war pic? Good stories are about people, not about a time period.And the main character here is a bore. And his relationship with his brother seems contrived.

Character development was minimal. For the skate crew, Hill used mainly actors with little or no experience acting and it shows. This approach can work and add a layer of authenticity (Gummo comes to mind) and to an extent does in this. However, none of this crew of teen skater buddies are developed much over the course of the film and remain 2 dimensional.
The film is paced quite slowly, and offers very little in the way of plot. There is nothing wrong with slower paced films in which 'not much' happens. Unfortunately, the pace of this film works against it, too many drawn out shots and scenes that offer little and just feel like filler. Hill captures the 90's aesthetic on film but this once again works against the film. The grainer quality reminded me of old 90s tv i used to watch. From the sense of nostalgia its a great choice and works on its own merit, but coupled with uninspired cinematography of the film it is incredibly bland.Its bearable, a few good moments throughout the movie help redeem its shortcomings but this film offers nothing original.

He loves the gang.""
This is a movie glorifying gang culture. The characters are portrayed unrealistically as having no jobs, just skating and partying, with no consequences other than a skating accident and a drunk driving crash. Where does the drug and alcohol money come from ... we never see. School? Forget it, never portrayed as apparently no one goes. The mother, horrified at what has happened to her son, at the last minute inexplicably flip-flops and encourages the gang to fellowship with her son in the hospital, where he is recovering from the crash. Hollywood ending: everyone is unrealistically happy at the end. See? Bad decisions DO lead to happiness, the film seems to argue.

The film follows Stevie, a 13 year old boy, who is searching to belong. He finds his place in a group of neighbourhood skateboarders, and learns that the life he imagines they live is much different than it seems. Hill's writing skillfully ensures that there are no details unnecessary to the story, and that no strings are left untied. Perfectly capturing the essence of finding family, love, and brotherhood, Hill's debut feels raw and perfectly balanced throughout. There are moments to laugh, moments to cry, and moments to feel an overwhelming nostalgia and joy. Hill's writing is clearly influenced by his own experiences growing up as a skateboarder in the middle of the 90s. The soundtrack to this film is the best I have heard for 2018. Although this film is somewhat niche due to it's subject matter, there will be something for every movie lover to enjoy.

Now, the film is definitely not for everyone (just look at some of the more negative reviews) but the characters and their diologue is great, it can have you rolling on the floor laughing, or shedding a tear. The 90's aspect was handled with a lot of care as far as I had seen, nothing was blown out, 90s for the sake of being 90s, instead was moreso just set as a background to the narrative. If you go into Mid90s expecting a full storyline, don't. This film is very reminiscent of Korine's ""Kids"" where there isn't necessarily a linear plot, instead is just a day in the life type film. With all of that being said, I 10/10 reccomend Mid90s and Jonah Hill KILLS it as the director/writer.",Mid90s

309,adamyachkouri,Great movie! Not quite enough,9,23 December 2018,"This is a great movie, and Jonah Hill does a good job of setting up Stevie and his friends' lives and their relationships with each other as well as their family as well. While we do know a lot about the backgrounds of these characters we never really get to SEE them. Very enjoyable film if you brought your big boy pants and can get through some of the foul language. Sad there wasn't more time though, the movie ends somewhere around the 90 minute mark.",Mid90s
310,mecollarimario,I lost while watching this movie,9,2 January 2019,I was feeling the reality while watching and felt like it was a scene i was watching on streets and not a movie. Really recommend this movie,Mid90s
311,sunny_shineflake,Thank you Jonah,10,17 March 2019,"...for this beautiful movie. It is very authentic, good choice of music, very well told and nicely put together with very believable actors. Reminds me of KIDS by Larry Clark, BOYHOOD but it is a story of its own. Kudos to A24 for producing this golden egg. Costumes, music, props, setting, it all fits together and makes you feel like sitting in a time machine. Pharcyde, A tribe called Quest, GZA, Public Enemy, Misifts, ESG, Bad Brains, Beastie Boys, Pixies, Wu Tang Clan and so on...Fu**** Fantastic. We need directors like Jonah Hill, who deeply understand the waves of a certain period of time and not just fake it by delivering action, drama and superficial flicks of music. Strongly recommended!!!",Mid90s
312,willkonen,Everyone Grows Up at a Different Pace,7,16 January 2019,"Jonah Hill a well respected actor for multiple films decided to switch rolls for this exciting thriller of a movie Mid90's, as the director and writer of this film. Jonah hill hit the nail on the head with this one. Mid90's is a movie based on skateboarding in California and how it provided many kids with a sense of peace and joy.
Jonah hill growing up and living through this era does a great job of truly giving the people what he grew up like. This movie revolves around a 12 year old named Stevie AKA ""sunburn"". Stevie's family life is tough living with his brother who frequently gives Stevie beatings and mom who struggles to support the family being a single parent. Stevie is looking for his calling, he discovers skateboarding and becomes instantly addicted. He looks to the local kids for guidance whom are all older than him. Stevie's character experiences all the joy and struggles of growing up in the Mid 90's, from learning how to skate to making friends and gaining interest in females. Some strengths of the film that truly caught my attention was the soundtrack for this will, Hill displayed classic 90's hip-hop with the skateboarding lifestyle. This helped show the people the culture that revolved around the skateboarding community in California. Not only was the soundtrack spot on the setting and costume design were absolutely astonishing truly gave the viewers a clear image of what it was like growing up in Jonah Hill's shoes.
Although this film had so many great moments that I truly enjoyed there are a couple things that I can say could have been much better. The first being the dialogue of the film. Don't get me wrong there was some good dialogue in this film but I feel that there needed to be much more, more interaction between the characters so we the viewers can get a clear description about how the characters think and talk. One thing that Hill did was use the same type video in the skateboarding videos. This addition was extremely important to the viewers because it shows what kids loved to do in the 90's. I can't say that I've seen a film like this, the way it was written and produced is so different from other films that it's so interesting.
At only 84 minutes, Mid90's is worth every dollar you pay to see it. This unbelievable written story about growing up in the 90's is a thriller. This movie will have you on the edge of your seat trying to predict what's going to happen, but little do you know it's not possible.",Mid90s
313,thomaskasper-42599,Spot on...,10,26 January 2019,"I have given this a 10 for nostalgia and to lift the rating from people unfairly giving it 2 and 3, saying that it is not realistic, they must be ignorant people that have never been close to the skate culture.This felt like it was taken directly out of my life in the mid 90s, like ""Kids"" this mockumentary feels like you are actually following these kids everyday life and problems, and the acting is very believable, especially Sunny Suljic. I can understand that not everybody can relate to this and therefore may find it unrealistic, but for those; you won't believe the bond that can be between a young group of skaters, especially if some of them come from difficult backgrounds.Spot on from Jonah Hill, if he hasn't written this from own experience then he has definitely been doing his research well.",Mid90s
