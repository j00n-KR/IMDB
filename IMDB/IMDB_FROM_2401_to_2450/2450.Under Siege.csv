0,MartinHafer,Kind of like DIE HARD at sea....and a lot better than I'd assumed it would be.,7,22 May 2019,"The fact that I'd give any Steven Segal movie a 7 is a shock to me. But, I must admit, it's a good film and he actually was very well cast in the movie!When the story begins, the psychotic Executive Officer (Gary Busey) of the USS Missouri battleship (it's actually the USS Alabama in the movie) is planning on a party for the Commanding Officer. However, I did say he was psychotic and the man is actually in charge of bringing aboard some other psychotics so that they can take over the ship...a ship armed with nuclear and all sorts of other weapons! Fortunately, one of the few men not captured by the evil commandos is Ryback (Segal) and he apparently is more than a match for the hijackers!There are two minor problems with the movie that kept me from giving it a higher score. First, the film is essentially DIE HARD but on a ship instead of in an office building. Second, Erika Eleniak's character is simply terrible and it seemed obvious that she was tacked onto the script at the last minute. She had little reason for being there and her character was simply awfully written...at first whiny and proclaiming ""I hate guns"" and ""I won't kill anyone"" even after the killing starts....and then later, this stripper character suddenly becomes a commando-type!!! This makes no sense nor did most of her dialog.These problems not withstanding, it IS a very tense and entertaining film. Plus, Segal is perfectly cast as his aikido skills don't always make sense in his other films...but her in small confined spaces it worked well....and Segal also tended to mumble less than usual. Overall, a fun film....just turn off your brain and enjoy it, as such a story really could NOT happen but the filmmakers made it seem like it could.",Under Siege
1,TheLittleSongbird,Seagal's best film,9,3 June 2011,"I have made it clear before that I personally do not like Steven Seagal or his films. I often find him lazy and uncharismatic, and his films are mostly derivative, shoddy, sloppily edited and poorly scripted. So it was a surprise that Under Siege was the complete opposite. Other than being a little too long, Under Siege is very entertaining and I'd go as far to say in my opinion it is Seagal's best movie. It looks good, the editing is more than decent and there are some striking production values. The film goes at a reasonably fast pace too, there is some witty scripting, the direction is surprisingly good, the story is engaging and the action is the best there is in any Seagal film. Seagal himself doesn't give an amazing performance, but here he does what he does best, and it is wholly acceptable. Best of all are Gary Busey and Tommy Lee Jones who are very charismatic. All in all, very entertaining and Steven Seagal's best. 9/10 Bethany Cox",Under Siege
2,Leofwine_draca,"Hardly original, but this action film's a favourite of mine",9,24 November 2016,"One of the many films to use DIE HARD as inspiration, UNDER SIEGE is so good that it's nearly on par with DIE HARD and its sequel. While DIE HARD was confined to a tower block, UNDER SIEGE's setting is a battleship, containing hundreds of corridors and different locations. It's a good setting too, and totally realistic, you always believe that the action is really taking place on the moving ship. Even in the enjoyably bad SPEED 2, a ship was put to good use as the setting for the action, I don't know why. Perhaps because of the fragility of the ship, perhaps because of the isolated setting. It's a winner though and I'm sure in future we'll see more films like these set on ships (and what happened to turn up after I'd written this review? Two films called DEEP RISING and VIRUS. I rest my case.) Secondly, the direction is pretty good. Andrew Davis is an excellent director and it shows in this film. There are never any boring moments, and the action is kept moving constantly. The film starts off slowly, gets fast quickly, and moves into hyper-drive for the finale. The actual action scenes are filmed with relish, shootouts occur and are quickly over in cramped locations, bullets fly and things explode realistically. These adrenaline-pumping moments are countered nicely by cuts to either the goodies or the baddies going about their business, delivering choice dialogue.Which leads me on to the acting. Surprisingly, the principal players are all good in their roles, although some of the supporting cast appear never to have seen a camera in their life. It's left up to Seagal, Eleniak, Jones, Busey, and Meaney to have endless fun in their clear cut, well-defined roles, stereotypical perhaps but very enjoyable. Seagal in particular has matured from being just another wooden cop in NICO: ABOVE THE LAW to his smart, funny, kind yet lethal cook in this film. He's at his most likable here, delivering punchlines and wisecracks all the time, which instantly endear him to the audience. He's a father figure, a protector, someone who'll never let you down, well except when he gets badly wounded by a grappling hook in a rare moment where we feel sorry for his character. Erika Eleniak stars in an obviously out of place role as the stripper who joins in with the shooting, she's not a good actress but then the role doesn't require her to be one - just the opposite in fact. Eleniak and Seagal enjoy some punchy dialogue when they team up, in much the same way Busey and Jones do.Tommy Lee Jones gives an outrageously over the top performance. Dressed as an ageing rocker, he soon provides himself to be the brains behind the plan, and delivers many witty remarks. He's not much of a fighter though, as will be glaringly obvious when you see a stuntman doubling for Jones in the final fight between him and Seagal. Gary Busey gives an amusingly wild performance as the sadistic, traitorous officer, ""outstanding"" in every way, he even dresses in drag in a comedy highlight. Colm Meaney isn't given much to do except look mean, but there's the novelty value of hearing him use lots of unsavoury language you wouldn't find in STAR TREK.And then, there are the acclaimed fight scenes we normally associate with Seagal films. Arms are broken, legs are broken, necks are hit so hard they break, people are punched out and shot in the head, torso, everywhere. As well as these expected deaths, Seagal uses his sneaky knife throwing trick to get an opponent in the neck, makes a microwave bomb which peppers another guy's face with shrapnel, kicks someone into a bandsaw, drops an iron girder that impales another baddie, and in the excellent finale, goes one on one with Jones in a knife fight. As you may guess, UNDER SIEGE is one of my fun favourites when it comes to action films. It's the film which led me to seek out the rest of Seagal's work, a successful hit. Not original, but enjoyable in every other way.",Under Siege
3,SnoopyStyle,Best Seagal Ever,8,4 November 2013,"If you're forced to watch one Steven Seagal movie, you best make it this one. The battleship Missouri is being decommissioned and Captain's personal cook Casey Ryback (Steven Seagal) is actually a Navy SEAL. Commander Krill (Gary Busey) is a bombastic man. He brings in entertainment for the Captain's birthday except the band turns out to be mercenaries led by William Stranix (Tommy Lee Jones). The only help may come from former playmate Jordan Tate (Erika Eleniak) who was supposed to be jumping out of a cake.There is Steven Seagal action. In addition, he does a good job not overplaying his role. There is a hot playmate who can actually act. There are not one but two great bad guys. Both Jones and Busey deliver great takes on the crazy bad guy. Jones is more intense and Busey is more crazy. The action is big enough and fun enough. This is Seagal doing the best Seagal movie ever.",Under Siege
4,kosmasp,Die Hard light,7,23 February 2021,"Everyone and their mother did a Die Hard movie at a certain point in time (van Damme did Sudden Death for example). This actually isn't too bad, if you don't mind that fact. And also that Steven Segal has the ability to show emotions as much as a ... I'm not even sure there is anything comparable. There is almost no emotion to speak of. But even worse, there is no acting going on either. At least back then he was able to move his feet, something he is not able to do anymore for quite some while.His hand work on the other ... hand, always was good. Also having Gary Busey and Tommy Lee Jones elevates the movie quite a bit to say the least. Action is solid and getting to see Erika Eleniak is also a treat (mostly clothed by the way, but since she's more or less playing herself ... hush now! You know what I mean!)! Overall surely one of his better outputs for sure",Under Siege
5,classicsoncall,"""I guess we'll just see what we'll see.""",7,19 August 2014,"Gee, I don't know - Seagal takes on thirty terrorists all by himself and comes out on top? I don't think so, but action fans love this kind of stuff and I'm a little partial to Seagal myself. Personally I prefer him when he's beating up on your standard bunch of saloon thugs or billiard room bullies where it's more up close and personal. At least you had Tommy Lee Jones and Miss July Gary Busey on hand here to add a maniacal touch to the festivities. Man, didn't Busey just creep you out in that dress and makeup? Probably the most unbelievable part of the story had Erika Eleniak go from a sniveling crybaby to an elite killer assassin in the space of an hour or so. Anyone could buy that, right? Well stuff like this is made for diversion and it's not the worst hour and a half you can spend. I'd have preferred a little more in the way of martial arts instead of the big guns but there are other Seagal films so you take what you get. Sure would like to have a birthday cake like that though.",Under Siege
6,gavin6942,Originality Under Siege,5,14 December 2005,"This film is constantly compared to ""Die Hard"" but I think this gives the movie too much credit. True, it's action-packed and has the great talents of Tommy Lee Jones, Colm Meaney and Gary Busey. But when you boil it down, it's just another Steven Seagal movie which are all basically the same thing. Luckily, this one isn't as bad as ""Half Past Dead""... this one even was nominated for 2 Oscars (God knows why). The plot is simple: terrorists take over an aircraft carrier... Seagal fights to get it back. Also appearing is Miss July 1989, known for three things: kissing Elliott in ""E.T."", showing her body in Playboy and in this film (an over-rated body if you ask me), and running in slow motion on ""Baywatch"" with David Hasselhoff. Ddi I mention acting? No, I didn't. And won't. But I admit this film is fun and full of energy - you could do a lot worse. If you want action and have see all the Die Hard movies, give this a try. And if you only ever see one Seagal movie as long as you live, make it this one. Somewhat recommended.",Under Siege
7,jboothmillard,Under Siege,7,15 March 2010,"I may have seen this film once before out of curiosity, and then the opportunity came to see it again, with Gary Busey appearing in Celebrity Big Brother, so I took it, from director Andrew Davis (The Fugitive). Basically on the legendary US battleship Missouri is ex-navy Seal now cook Casey Ryback (Steven Seagal) who has been put out of the way so that he can't butt heads, and so the crew can celebrate the birthday of Captain Adams (Patrick O'Neal). A rock band, led by ex-CIA operative William Stranix (Tommy Lee Jones) board the ship, but then chaos begins with gunfire going off and the remaining crew being locked up. Stranix, with the help of now enemy Commander Krill (Point Break's Gary Busey), plans to use the many tomahawks and nuclear missiles on board to create chaos in many places, not for money, but for revenge. So Stranix has his team of villainous technicians to keep the ship and weapons in check, Ryback has got model and entertainer Jordan Tate (Baywatch's Erika Eleniak) to take back control of the ship. Ryback with his expertise in explosives, tactical and fighting skills gets around the ship to make a warning to the military forces, kill the many thugs and get to the crew. Also starring Colm Meaney as Doumer, Damian Chapa as Tackman, Ace Ventura: Pet Detective's Troy Evans as Granger, David McKnight as Flicker, Lee Hinton as Cue Ball, Glenn Morshower as Ensigh Taylor, Leo Alexander as Lieutenant Smart and John Rottger as Commander. Green. Seagal is not the most charismatic and good looking actor, this is probably the only good film you will find in, he just about carries the hero role off, but the one who steals the show is maniacal and flamboyant villain Jones, and good support villainy from Busey. You may find yourself questioning some of the technical film flam dialogue, but you can ignore it and just concentrate on the funny mad turns from Jones, and great sequences full of gunfire and explosions, it is a terrific and entertaining action adventure. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Sound Effects Editing and Best Sound. Very good!",Under Siege
8,Woodyanders,An infectiously absurd escapist action hoot,8,8 September 2008,"A vicious band of terrorist hijackers lead by bitter and vengeful covert operative William Stranix (the always fine Tommy Lee Jones in peak wicked form) take over a Navy battleship in order to get their evil hands on an arsenal of nuclear missiles. It's up to cynical and disgraced former Navy Seal turned measly cook Casey Ryback (remarkably stiff'n'stolid stoneface supreme Steven Seagal sans his trademark ponytail) and several others to stop them. Director Andrew Davis, working from a gloriously preposterous script by J.F. Lawton, relates the gripping ""Die Hard"" on a boat story at a nonstop breakneck pace, creates a reasonable amount of tension, and stages the copious action set pieces with considerable rip-roaring aplomb. Seagal is his usual dry and cardboard self. Fortunately, the strong supporting cast compensates for his flatness. Jones in particular makes for a great hateful and ruthless heavy. However, Gary Busey almost steals the whole show with his deliciously deranged portrayal of the treacherous Commander Krill, a man so heinous that he not only tries to drown his own men, but also has the gall to spit in Ryback's bouillabaisse sauce as well (Gary even does a hysterically funny drag scene to boot!). Plus there are sound turns by Patrick O'Neal as the sage Captain Adams, Andy Romano as the ramrod Admiral Bates, Colm Meaney as the coldblooded Doumer, Nick Mancuso as shady chain-smoking jerk Tom Breaker, and Troy Evans as the gung-ho Granger. Delectable ""Baywatch"" blonde babe Erika Eleniak isn't given much to do in the thankless role of the token hot chick, but at least bares her beautifully bountiful breasts in one of the single most laughably gratuitous topless scenes ever committed to celluloid. The brutal hand-to-hand fisticuffs and heated firefights are every bit as taut and exciting as they ought to be. Frank Tidy's slick cinematography, Gary Chang's rousing, throbbing score and a cool trashy rock soundtrack are all likewise up to par. Sure, this movie is wildly implausible and ridiculous to the extreme, but it's this very sense of gleeful absurdity which makes it so much tremendously entertaining dumb fun.",Under Siege
9,ccthemovieman-1,This Seagal Flick Took The Cake,8,7 July 2006,"This was a fast-moving Rambo-style action flick (good guys never get hit despite 10,000 rounds of ammunition fired at them) that was very popular. It spawned a very weak sequel, par for the course. Several reviewers here wrote that it is Steven Seagal's ""best movie,"" and I wouldn't argue with that..""Under Siege"" probably was more popular than the normal Segal action flick because of several aspects: 1 - the interesting story featuring the ""lowly cook"" (as Seagal described himself in this film) beating a bunch of terrorists taking over a U.S. Navy vessel; 2 - the over-the-top villains portrayed by fun-to-watch actors Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Busey, and 3 - the fabulous looks and body of Erika Eleniak, who pops out of a cake topless in a sight that every guy who saw this film remembers.Jones was just about hitting his acting career peak as he demonstrated the following year with his Oscar-winning performance in ""The Fugitive."" Busey was the opposite, nearing the end of his run after a starring role as singer ""Buddy Holly"" made him famous. This film might be Segal's most successful, or at least in the top three. His star has faded since the new century. Eleniak never made it far past the cake. She played ""Elly May"" in ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" the following year and nothing but 'B' films after that.The first part of this movie is far better than the second. It gets out-of-control by the end, as most of these action films do with the violence overdone and with little credibility. But watching the three leads, and ogling Eleniak, always make this film fun to watch for a little while, at least.",Under Siege
10,rmax304823,Likable genre piece.,6,12 January 2007,"What is Erika Eleniak doing in the movie, you ask? She is there as a proxy for the audience. ""Let me GO!"", she cries. Or, ""I'm afraid of being alone."" And she asks things like, ""What are you doing now?"" And Seagal can reply: ""I'm disconnecting the circuit from the Smegmaphage GPS to the Etconspiri Two Two Oh."" ""What does that mean?"" ""It means pointless bilingual word play. No, seriously, when I'm done they won't have access to the head."" Probably it's not fair to call this a Siegel movie. You could call it a Schwarzenegger movie or a Stallone movie or a Willis movie or a Lundgren movie except for the fact that the action figure in this instance happens to be Seagal.His acting is, like the recent demotion of Pluto from planethood, not something to be praised or criticized. It's a simple fact of nature that must finally be realized. Eleniak can be dismissed, despite the admirable contours of her pelvic girdle. Gary Busey is pretty good, though. He's better as a man than a woman. As a woman he has no appeal whatever. As a guy he's almighty spooky. He's had his ups and downs, sabotaged at times by personal demons, but has turned in some fine performances along the way. Check out his frightening jerk in ""Carny."" The other bad guy, the chief villain, is Tommy Lee Jones who overacts outrageously and is lots of fun to watch as an aging rock star and traitor.The story? A couple of dozen heavies with diverse technical skills take over a battleship about to be retired and threaten to destroy half the world with Tomahawk missiles unless they are paid a ransom equal to ten times the GNP of Oman. The plan is spoiled by Seagal and all the bad guys die violent and often highly colorful deaths. Some of them are foolish enough to take on Seagal mano a mano, evidently never having seen any of his movies.Anyway, I kind of like it. Battleships are great for action movies. Lots of nooks and crannies to hide in and to ambush others from. Big guns. Jones is on deck when a 16-inch gun is fired and is blown away and deafened temporarily. I can only imagine that that's accurate. If you are behind even a 5-inch gun your hair stands on end. Oh -- and another good thing. There are a couple of small-arms exchanges below decks, and the sound department has spared us the whine of bullets ricocheting off into infinity. (Cf., ""Magnum Force."") If you enjoy action movies, this one should suit you.",Under Siege
11,Tweekums,Die Hard on a battleship!,8,29 September 2012,"After being decommissioned in Hawaii the USS Missouri; a colossal battleship is taking its last journey and it won't be plain sailing! To celebrate the captain's fiftieth birthday the Executive Officer, Cmdr. Krill, has arranged a surprise party which is to involve having a band, some caterers and Jordan Tate AKA Miss July 1989 flown in by helicopter. The only problem is that with the exception of Miss Tate none of them is who they seem to be; they, along with Krill, intend to seize the ship along with its tomahawk nuclear missiles. The group is led by former CIA operative William Stranix who was understandably upset when the Agency decided he was no longer required and tried to kill him. When their plan swings into action most of the crew are quickly captured or killed; one exception is Casey Ryback, the chef. Krill has him under marine guard in the galley but he isn't captive for long. Ryback isn't an ordinary cook; he is a former Navy Seal and he is trained for just this sort of problem! Ryback soon finds an ally Jordan Tate! The two of them work to thwart Krill's plans and prevent a nuclear strike against Honolulu!This is a solid action thriller; probably Steven Seagal's best film; certainly the best one I've seen. He plays Ryback and does a pretty good job in the role managing to hold his own against Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Busey who play Stranix and Krill; they are both delightfully over the top villains at one point Busey dons a dress complete with a chest that makes Erika Eleniak, who plays Jordan Tate look small! At first I thought her appearance was just eye-candy and her emerging from a giant cake showing her breasts seemed to confirm this fear; thankfully when she puts some clothes on she made a good character not necessarily believable but fun to watch. The story was pretty good and the action is great without getting too gruesome; there are shootings, knife-fights and explosions to keep things exciting and not too much time is wasted on unnecessary exposition.",Under Siege
12,ma-cortes,Noisy action features Steven Seagal against some bad guys who take a warship,6,20 February 2010,"Seagal's fifth film with lots of violence, suspense, struggles and action-filled. This Steven Seagal's splendid film deals about a tough cook-marine , he's a SEAL and Aikido expert. Ryback teams up with a playboy girl (Erika Eleniak), forming a sympathetic duo. Casey takes on nuclear arms smugglers and undergoes a violent confrontation some corrupt terrorists ( two exaggerated villains as Tommy Lee Jones, Gary Busey) and their criminal hoodlums.The picture packs unstopped action, thrills,fighting , shootouts, suspense and is quite entertaining.Violent and not particularly literary but worthy entry in action genre and realized in ¨Die hard¨ style. Wooden Seagal plays the violent Casey Ryback, he cleans up the battleship by means of punch, kicks, bounds and leaps, martial arts abound with fights certainly slick.The Aikido expert Seagal saves the day in this exciting movie which also co-produced .In the film appears many secondary roles played by prestigious players as Patrick O'Neal,Colm Meany, Damian Chapa, Raymond Cruz , Bernie Casey, Nick Mancuso and several others.Elaborately produced action film with two-fisted Seagal is just another action film full of struggles ,thrills, noise and lots of violence. Ever-wooden Seagal as almost always, playing a stalwart and loner fighter, he delivers the goods in his own style full of usual violence and fights with snapping wrists and worth it just to see Steve in action. Atmospheric musical score by Gary Chang though composed by synthesizer and appropriate cinematography by Frank Tidy. The picture was made in the Seagal's best period when he played high budget movies such as ¨Hard to kill¨(1990 by Bruce Malmuth), this ¨Under siege¨ ( Seagal's best film to date, 92), and the sequel titled : ¨Dark territory¨ (1995, Geoff Murphy), ¨Executive decision¨ (96 by Stuart Baird), ¨Glimmer man¨ (96, John Gray), ¨Exit wounds¨(2001, Andre Bartkowiak), among others. Nowadays he does fairly low standards, lesser budget and direct to video , such as ¨Half past dead¨, ¨The foreigner¨ and its sequel, ¨Shadow man ¨, ¨Flight of fury¨, ¨Urban justice¨ and many others.Director Andrew Davis who previously gave credibility to Chuck Norris in 'Code of silence' teams up with Aikido expert Seagal for this action-filled thriller.The picture contains enough action and violence for fans of the genre and the addicts will give this a passing grade because is professionally directed by Andrew Davis. He has shot most of his films in Chicago and he's an action movies expert(The guardian, Collateral damage, Chain reaction, The fugitive) and again directed to Seagal in this his best movie . This is a thrilling picture, ,exciting and tense at times with fine work ,as always, from director Andrew Davis. If you're a former Steven Seagal fan you'll like it because is a strong outing for action buffs. The result is a strong outing for action enthusiasts and Seagal is fun to watch.",Under Siege
13,Coventry,Bad Guys Galore!,7,14 January 2009,"I remember, mostly back when it got released but even still now, dull critics and sour people in general simply categorized ""Under Siege"" as a lousy and uninspired version of ""Die Hard"" on a battleship instead of atop a skyscraper. Okay, this may very well be the most apt description imaginable, but that doesn't mean this movie can't awesome popcorn entertainment! I usually restrain from writing about anything that isn't horror or cult cinema, but I gladly make exceptions for action flicks if they A) are extremely violent and/or B) feature highly memorable villainous characters. These two factors happen to be very well-presented in ""Under Siege"". There's an enormous body count throughout the entire movie and the bad guys  well  they are simply what makes this film so darn enjoyable. I've never really been a fan of Steven Seagal and agree that if his role were to be played by Bruce Willis or perhaps even Sylvester Stallone the film could even be better, but it doesn't really matter all that much thanks to Colm Meaney, Gary Busey and Tommy Lee Jones. Particularly Busey as the treacherous and psychopathic commander and Jones as dangerously demented former special agent are so terrific that you'll often even forget Seagal wanders around the ship somewhere as well. A lot of mariners are gathered on the USS Missouri to attend a Pearl Harbour memorial but mostly to participate in the captain's birthday party afterwards. The ideal opportunity for greedy Cmdr. Krill (Busey) and a troop of mercenaries led by William Stranix to hijack the battleship and toy around with its huge arsenal of nuclear weaponry. One thing they didn't take into account, however, is the presence of the Captain's personal friend and acclaimed chef Casey Ryback. Ryback never really liked Krill  maybe because the latter spat in his bouillabaisse?  and with his secret Navy SEAL past, the terrorists are up against an opponent much tougher than they bargained for. Exactly like it was the case in the aforementioned ""Die Hard"", ""Under Siege"" benefits mostly from its claustrophobic and nearly inescapable setting. Director Andrew Davis admirably makes great use of the ship's dark interiors and ominous mechanical chambers by having his characters stroll around endlessly with their guns ready to fire away. This is definitely Steven Seagal's best film and it would have even been better if his character was a deaf-mute, or something! His corny one-liners are terrible, but luckily he's often accompanied by the ravishing Baywatch babe Erika Eleniak (who also treats us to a totally gratuitous but oh-so-welcome boobs shot) or one of the baddies. Actually, I can't even be sure if this is Seagal's best film as I still haven't seen the majority of his not-so-impressive repertoire. I sincerely doubt, however, that straight-to-video productions like ""Belly of the Beast"" and ""Urban Justice"" can be any better than this modest action hit of the glorious early 90's.",Under Siege

15,hitchcockthelegend,Seagal cooks up a top notch buttock kicker.,8,19 May 2009,"Masquerading as the ships cook, one man army Casey Ryback is forced to fighting off pirates who want to commandeer his ship and its nuclear capabilities.The DVD cover proudly boasts that this is Die Hard on a boat!, and they be right. Because of all the shallow, and at times painful imitators that followed Bruce Willis' action molder in 1988, Under Siege is right up with the best of them. It's of course a complete no brainer, one where the outcome is inevitable, Seagal we know will don his usual blank expression and beat the living daylights out of all comers, and even look cool in the process!. Thankfully the action sequences are handled excellently by director Andrew Davis, this is not out and out carnage, and with Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Busey having the time of their villainy lives, Under Siege just really rocks the action genre boat.Not one to look too deeply into, lest one is obsessed with token totty Erika Eleniak that is, but certainly a film that is as much fun as it is knowingly dumb. 8/10",Under Siege
16,Theo Robertson,Not A Classic,4,12 December 2002,""" Steven Seagal sets the screen alight in the all action classic- UNDER SIEGE "" said the BBC announcer before the transmission . I beg to differ Mr Announcer . UNDER SIEGE isn`t the worst action film ever made but its no classic either . It can best be described as an ultra violent episode of MACGUYVER with the hero living on his wits and making all sorts of deadly booby traps with anything that comes to hand . The best aspect of the film is the performances oof Busey and Jones as the bad guys . Conversly the worst aspect of UNDER SIEGE is the performance of the leading man. We could sit all day on one of the boards and discuss who is the greatest ever action star but there can be no doubt that the worst one is Steven Seagal . He has the facial expression of a totem pole and the voice of a speak your weight machine that`s overdosed on tranquillisers , and seeing as UNDER SIEGE features Seagal`s greatest ever performance as an actor it comes as no surprise we don`t see him on cinema screens anymore "" You`re good. You`re very good "" No you`re not Steven you`re very bad and the only way you`ll set my TV screen alight is if you come round to my flat with a flamethrower",Under Siege
17,Scarecrow-88,Under Siege,8,1 January 2010,"Covert operatives, led by maniacal Strannix(Tommy Lee Jones)commandeer the battleship USS Missouri, disguised as a band and catering(..assisted by high-ranking officer, Commander Krill(Gary Busey))for the birthday party of Captain Adams(Patrick O'Neal), with plans to off load, by way of a railing system, Tomahawk, nuclear-tipped missiles on board a North Korean submarine. What they don't expect is a cook, Stacey Ryback(Steven Seagal), interrupting their grand design at making millions from foreign clients..what Krill couldn't discover until after Adams' ""removal"" was that this annoying, pain-in-the-ass cook was an ex-Seal with martial arts, weapons, and bomb-making skills. Even with about 30 men at his disposal, working throughout the Missouri, Strannix can not seem to halt Ryback's abilities to move about at will, taking them out little by little. Ryback has an unlikely ally in a Playboy model, Jordan Tate(Erika Eleniak, who was a major babe during this period)who he finds by accident, popping out of a cake intended for Adams. Together they free some trapped sailors, and attempt to thwart the efforts of Strannix, Krill, and their goons, hoping to stop the transmission of missiles, as well as disrupt their methods.The film alternates between the Missouri and a secret building within the Pentagon where Ryback will communicate with the military and governmental suits, such as Admiral Bates(Andy Romano), keeping them apprised of the ongoing situation. Meanwhile, we see how those in the Pentagon react as Strannix and company go about to threaten possible global terror. Those in the Pentagon plan, if they must, to send an air strike in order to keep the Missouri from destroying civilizations.Having previously worked with Steven Seagal on Above the Law, director Andrew Davis knew what to expect..let's face it, Seagal isn't gonna captivate us with some sterling performance. Stevens lets Seagal do what he does best, wipe out the bad guys in various ways, such as gunfights and knife battles. Anyone who comes within close proximity of Seagal is mincemeat, plain and simple. This was one of three films Stevens worked with Tommy Lee Jones, and the second where he's a villain and killer. Under Siege has plenty of personality to compensate for Seagal's lack thereof(..though, his silent calm is part of what makes his characters effective, the way they go about their business, not letting too much emotion take away from their abilities to take out those who wish to disrupt the peace, unleashing fury on the hostile and base). Stevens, for instance, allows TLJ to let it all hang out, going into any direction he so wishes, giving him every opportunity to go completely off-the-charts psychopathic. Busey, his side-kick, is also given carte blanche to chew as much scenery as he so desires(..he even has a scene in drag where he asks Strannix, ""Do I look like I need a psychological evaluation?""). While TLJ is made short work by Seagal at the end, it's not about their final dueling of blades that he's used, but all the time before this. He's used as entertainment while Seagal obliterates his men, it's a balance I think that works exceptionally.I just love the way Stevens shoots the action set pieces throughout the ship, following Ryback and the few he has to help him..Stevens gets every bit of value he can from the ship setting(aboard the USS Alabama, in actuality), and the way Ryback goes about his business actually doesn't seem too far-fetched. Sure, he's a Rambo archetype, but I figure there are many like me who find great joy in these ""one man army"" movies. I like, though, how Ryback requires assistance from others in order to stop Krill from fixing a damaged wing(..Ryback bombed)on the sub and the many scumbags firing at them throughout the Missouri. I like the decision to alternate between the ship and Pentagon, establishing the importance of successfully upending Strannix or else risk doom to the civilized world. I imagine Seagal looks back at this movie with pride, it's easily one of his best to date.",Under Siege
18,Hey_Sweden,Awesome action flick.,9,23 July 2013,"Let me just join the chorus here in saying that ""Under Siege"" is definitely the best film of Steven Seagals' career. It benefits from the presence of a genre pro as director, Andrew Davis. He'd previously directed Seagal in ""Above the Law"", and he shows how well he can handle large scale action and shooting in confined locations. Another plus is more colourful villains than usual, extremely well played by Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Busey; they're both endlessly amusing. Playboy Playmate Erika Eleniak adds appreciable eye candy, and the film also has that irresistible over the top brutality that characterized Seagals' early films.Seagal plays Casey Ryback, a cook aboard the U.S.S. Missouri who must save the day when mercenaries, led by Jones and assisted by disgruntled officer Busey, touch down on the battleship under the guise of a blues band. They quickly take over, but Busey conveniently forgets about Seagal, who's able to slip away and start taking measures to stop the bad guys' plans. Ryback isn't entirely on his own, though, acquiring some companions (including Eleniak, who plays a centerfold hired to jump out of a birthday cake) along the way. Of course, as prepared as these bad guys are, they're no match for this particular cook.Slick as hell, this ass kicking film is consistently fun, perfect popcorn fare with a great pace and a sense of humour about itself. Seagal looks loose and relaxed here; even though he's never been much of an actor, he's always proved quite watchable (at least in his earlier efforts). Busey is a standout among the villains; at one point, he's actually dressed in drag. A *ton* of familiar faces play supporting and small parts: Colm Meaney, Patrick O'Neal, Andy Romano, Nick Mancuso, Troy Evans, Glenn Morshower, Bernie Casey, Raymond Cruz, Duane Davis, George Cheung, Sandy Ward, Michael Des Barres, Dennis Lipscomb, and Dale Dye. There's enough explosions and gunfire to maintain ones' attention, as well as one marvelous and memorable comeuppance for one of the baddies.With a stirring score by Gary Chang as accompaniment, this is rock solid escapism from start to finish, and it's too bad that this level of quality in a Seagal flick wouldn't recur after this.Nine out of 10.",Under Siege
19,LeonLouisRicci,Lively and Fun,8,22 January 2013,"This is Steven Seagal's most popular film among fans and critics. Although he made some others that are just as good. Above the Law (1988), Out for Justice (1991), and Under Siege 2 (1995). These three are not as slick and audience friendly and have more gritty violence and raw characters.But this movie could be called his most fun. It has a light hearted tone and there is a lot played for laughs by the co-stars and there is much attention given to the ship itself. It is a lively affair with enough ingredients to give everyone a good time, even non-fans of the action star.Overall it is an inoffensive action flick with some big budget gimmicks and fun villains, some very good cinematography, and high powered sound. If you liked this one check out those others for even more entertainment from the whispering martial arts expert.",Under Siege
20,poolandrews,One of Seagal's better efforts.,7,18 September 2007,"Under Siege starts as the USS Missouri battleship prepares for a surprise party for Capatin Adams (Patrick O'Neal), a large group of caterers & musicians board the ship & the party starts. However it turns out the caterers & entertainers are in fact a highly trained team of mercenaries lead by William Stranix (Tommy Lee Jones) who take control of the Missouri & it's arsenal of weaponry & missiles including nuclear Tomahawks. The entire crew is captured & locked in the bow except for a seemingly harmless cook named Casey Ryback (producer Steven Seagal) who was locked in a freezer, now he's out, he's an ex Navy Seal & takes it upon himself to sort the bad guy's out with the help of Miss July Jordan Tate (Erika Eleniak)...This French American co-production was directed by Andrew Davis I have to say that Under Siege is one of Steven Seagal's better efforts during a time where he could actually fight & had a neck. The script by J.F. Lawton was apparently originally called Dreadnought which just sounds terrible, anyway this is a decent action flick in the Die Hard (1988) mould. I mean a group of heavily armed men capture some sort of building/boat/train/plane etc take a load of hostages, a lone one man hero has save the day single handedly & cue lots of explosions, fights, gun battles & unnecessarily gratuitous violence involving homemade bombs & combat throwing knives. Maybe I've become desensitised to really violent imagery but while looking at a film like Under Siege & even more so in it's sequel one can't help but feel violence is being glamorised, Seagal's character Casey Ryback is as brutal & vicious as any of the bad guy's here & the film becomes a constant barrage of ever increasing violent sequences of him killing the bad guy's & considering he is meant to be the hero he's not setting a great example. I must admit that I'm not too happy with the overall 'fight violence with even more violence' message that this film portrays in no uncertain terms, don't get me wrong because I like some ass kicking violence but sometimes one can question just what sort of example these types of films are setting. Having said that this moves along at a nice enough pace, it has a good solid good vs. bad guy story with decent character's & there's plenty of action & violence that will satisfy most action flick junkies.Director Davis does a good job here, there's a nice claustrophobic feel to the tight galley-ways & corridors. The action is brisk & well choreographed although maybe a little too violent for some. There are loads of shootings & bloody bullet wounds, people are blown up by grenades, people are slashed with knives, stabbed, shoved into band saws, eyes & throats are gouged out, people are crushed by falling metal beams & someone gets a huge combat knife stuck in their head. Again I don't normally mind some gory violence but it just seemed to me that the supposed hero played by Seagal was taking as much pleasure in hurting & killing people as the bad guy's & that just sat a bit uneasily with me.With a supposed budget of about $35,000,000 this did great business at the box-office, it's well made with that big budget Hollywood action flick feel about it with over-the-top explosions & huge set-pieces. The USS Alabama battleship museum in Mobile in Alabama was used as the USS Missouri. The acting is OK, Seagal is actually thin in this, the likes of Tommy Lee Jones & Gary Busey are fine actor's & manage to compensate for Seagal's lack of talent in that particular area. Eleniak gets her breasts out to play Miss July 1989 when in fact in real life she was Playboy Playmate of the month for July 1989, talk about typecasting...Under Siege is a great action flick & one of Seagal's best, it's got plenty of violence, action, explosions, great villains & a good solid story. Worth a watch for sure. Followed by the even better Under Siege 2: Dark Territory (1995) which, for me, remains Seagal's best film.",Under Siege
21,utgard14,Seagal's Best,7,22 August 2014,"Rogue CIA operative William Strannix (Tommy Lee Jones) and his gang of mercenaries take over the battleship USS Missouri with inside help from batshit crazy Navy officer Krill (Gary Busey). At first things are going pretty smoothly for them but it turns out they forgot one little thing: the ship's cook, former Navy SEAL Casey Ryback (Steven Seagal). Watch Ryback Die Hard it up and take out the bad guys one by one, leading to the inevitable final fight with Strannix for the fate of the world...or something like that.Awesome actioner with a wonderful cast. Steven Seagal's best and most polished movie. When you have Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Busey as villains, the script pretty much writes itself. Both are terrific with colorful performances like you might expect. Seagal does his usual stuff, which is probably hit or miss with most people. I actually like his early movies so I can't complain. Special mention to beautiful Erika Eleniak, who has probably her best film role in this. She's a comedic sidekick character and is quite good at it. She also has a brief topless scene, which hurt absolutely nothing. It's a fun movie. One of the few Seagal movies that can be enjoyed on its merits without the slightest hint of irony.",Under Siege
22,Boba_Fett1138,Die Hard on a ship.,6,4 August 2006,"This movie is one of the best Steven Seagal movies but not that that is saying much of course.It's a pretty simple action movie, as action movies are supposed to be. It has a simple plot and basically only serves as an excuse to let the Seagal character kill as many villains as possible, preferably with a knife. It however is a better than average movie for a couple of reasons.Most important reason for this are the villains. Not the characters themselves but more the actors that portray them. Tommy Lee Jones, Gary Busey and Colm Meaney play the main villains. Three awesome actors. Especially Tommy Lee Jones is great, namely toward the ending when all the breaks are off by him. And I never expected to see Gary Busey as a drag queen. That was awesome, as well as unexpected (and completely unnecessary by the way once you really start thinking about it). I however felt that the villains were not enough present in the movie and the movie mainly was a Steven Seagal-flick, which will definitely still mainly pleases his fans of course.The action is good, although it mostly consists out of only shootouts and a couple of explosions. The knife fights were a bit too ridicules in my opinion but I guess Seagal himself enjoyed it more as I did. It didn't exactly made the movie any more credible. The movie itself is quite honestly nothing too spectacular, just an entertaining enough action-flick. The movie its reputation is definitely better than the actual movie itself.The musical score by Gary Chang is surprising good and worth owning and listening to.In the end the movie is nothing more than a ""Die Hard"" wannabe set on a ship this time. It still has power and quality on its own but not quite enough to regard this movie as one of the best or most memorable movies out of the genre. The movie is only maybe a little memorable thanks to its three main villains.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Under Siege
23,view_and_review,Best Segal Flick,8,9 June 2014,"Under Siege is probably my favorite Steven Segal movie. I loved Hard to Kill, Marked for Death and Out for Justice but those movies were more or less carbon copies of one another. With Under Siege taking place on a naval ship it made the story and the action a lot different.Segal plays Casey Ryback, a navy cook who just so happens to be a bad mofo. He has to put his fighting skills and prowess to the test when the ship is hijacked by William Stranix (Tommy Lee Jones). It was nothing but thrills.This was the first movie I'd ever seen Tommy Lee Jones in and he played a wonderful bad guy. I mean he was a perfect fit for the animated megalomaniac type. The movie was great.",Under Siege

Casey is the only one who can defeat these villains from unloading its nuclear missiles for sale, and does precisely that... Entertaining film may not be entirely credible, with campy villains, but delivers enough crowd-pleasing excitement to compensate.",Under Siege

Everyone aboard is about to celebrate the birthday of Captain Adams.They've even hired a band led by William Strannix, and former playboy playmate Jordan Tate to jump out of a cake and dance.What Adams doesn't know is that he is in for a deadly surprise.Strannix has Adams killed and takes the ship to steal its nuclear missiles, spreading his men, including Commander Krill, throughout the ship, but Strannix and his men are underestimating Casey.Casey is an expert in martial arts, weapons, tactics, and explosives. After crossing paths with Jordan, Casey lets Jordan tag along with him in his mission to stop Strannix...To the non-Seagal fan, this was the best film he ever made. To the fan, this was the beginning of the end of his star power.Thats not dismissing his other films, they all have an endearing place in my heart, but the box office dwindled after this.But this is the best Die Hard homage/rip off, and the production values are great. The story is what you would expect from this type of movie, and it sails along without causing the grey matter any problems.Seagal is good, but the lack of Aikido can be frustrating at times, as is the manner Seagal holds his guns, but he looks like he is enjoying himself and provides a great performance.Lee Jones does what he does bet, as the villain with the sarcastic tone and animated body (see also Blown Away) and Busey and Meany are great foes too.Eleniak steals the momentum from the film, and ruins the pace with her whinging and performance. She is only there for laughs, but never really says anything funny.Davis has made a slick, exciting, taut movie that never lets up on action but leaves a few things unexplained (I wish the Strannix/Ryback back story was elaborated on), but other than that, it's a fun night in and it won't disappoint action fans.",Under Siege
26,Aaron1375,Easily Steven Segal's best starring role flick.,8,17 July 2007,"Why is this movie any better than his others? Well for one thing the story, it has one. His previous movies had stories of course, but they were all so similar that they were hard to distinguish. Usually him getting revenge or something. This one features him as a cook with a secret (he is a butt kicking chef). The other factor that makes this better than his usual movie is the villains. You have Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Busey, both portray great villains here. It is nice to see a Segal movie that has some good actors in it. Well these villains proceed to take over this ship and of course our hero is not accounted for and fights to take it back with the help of a stripper who pops out of a cake in a rather sexy scene. Yes, this does sound a bit like Die Hard doesn't it? So that is that, a good action flick for the most part. Not that it doesn't contain any flaws, the final fight is particularly bad as it is very one sided, and we are talking about Steven Segal here, he is not incredibly bad, but he is not the best actor in the world either. Still, this movie makes up for the short comings by being a very fast paced action adventure in the mold of a Die Hard flick.",Under Siege
27,Wuchakk,Great one-man-army flick,7,13 March 2014,"One-man-army flicks became popular in the 80s with the ""Rambo"" movies and, later, with the ""Die Hard"" films. 1992's ""Under Siege"" is a film in that mold.THE PLOT: Casey Ryback (Steven Seagal) is a Navy Seal and hero who works as a cook on a battleship to finish out his 20-year stint in the service (the Captain saved him from court martial for insubordination by graciously getting him the gig). A group of terrorist thugs come aboard and take over the ship. They purpose to steal the ship's nuclear missiles. There's one problem: Ryback is loose on the ship and he's a professional killing machine, a veritable one-man-army.It takes about 25-minutes for the story to set up, and then the action kicks in. From there it's Ryback v.s. the thugs all the way to the end. The film runs 1 hour and 38 minutes before the credits roll.A few notables: -- Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Busey are truly exceptional as the psychotic villains.-- Steven Seagal is perfect and even likable as the Rambo-like hero. The sequel ""Under Siege 2: Dark Territory"" takes place on a train, and it's a good one-man-army flick as well, but not as good as this one. Anyway, I've only seen a handful of Seagal films and ""Under Siege"" is by far his best.-- Erika Eleniak co-stars as the playboy bunny who came aboard to entertain during the big party. She has a notorious pop-out-of-the-cake scene where she's wearing very little clothing. Aside from this brief scene she appears fully clothed throughout the entire picture. Anyway, this infamous cake scene has become quite the running joke between me, my wife, my brother-in-law and sister. Generally speaking, red-blooded males will cherish the scene (their carnal side, that is) whereas wives and girlfriends will hate it or, at least, dismiss it with a role of the eyes. It's all in good fun, but I wouldn't let the kiddies see it.-- The entire film is confined to a battleship at sea, which makes it almost claustrophobic. So don't watch ""Under Siege"" if you're in the mood for picturesque landscapes (like, say, ""First Blood"").-- While seeing the film it dawned on me how knowledgeable the screenwriter(s) must have been about all-things military. A truly exceptional job.-- I was also impressed with the directing, cinematography and editing. Such things usually don't occur to me while watching films, so it has to be pretty outstanding for me to notice. Needless to say, this is, technically speaking, a first-rate picture.So why not a higher rating? Because all one-man-army films must be judged in comparison to ""First Blood,"" the Citizen Kane of one-man-army flicks. And ""Under Siege"" falls a bit short. It's quite compelling but it's no where near as captivating as ""First Blood."" GRADE: B+",Under Siege

29,JamesHitchcock,One of the More Entertaining Tough-guy Adventures.,5,4 August 2006,"The last Steven Seagal film that I saw was ""The Foreigner"", which I can honestly say was the worst film I have seen for many years. It remains the only film I have reviewed for IMDb which I have awarded the minimum mark of 1/10.I was, therefore, pleasantly surprised by ""Under Siege"". Certainly, it is not a particularly good film, but compared with ""The Foreigner"" it looks like ""Citizen Kane"". A group of terrorists take over an American warship, the USS Missouri, hoping to steal its nuclear-tipped missiles, but are thwarted by Casey Ryback, a former Navy SEAL now working as the ship's cook. At first Ryback's only ally is Jordan Tate, a Playboy centrefold (""Miss July 1989""), who has flown out to the ship for the Captain's birthday celebrations, but he later has the assistance of a group of sailors he manages to rescue.The best acting performance comes from Tommy Lee Jones as the psychopathic leader of the terrorists, a former CIA agent turned rogue killer. Jones's contribution, however, is something of a mixed blessing. While it undoubtedly improves the overall quality of the film to have a gifted actor in a leading role, the contrast with Jones's abilities serves to underline by contrast the weakness of Seagal's performance. Seagal plays Ryback in his normal tight-lipped, laconic style, rarely allowing himself to show any emotions. His martial arts skills are much on display; his acting ones are more elusive. Erika Eleniak (who was herself Playboy's real Miss July 1989) confirms her hard-won rank of Bimbo, First Class, a rank gained during her years as one of the Baywatch girls. The transition from television star to genuine first-rate film star is often a difficult one; like most of her fellow Baywatch beauties Eleniak has an impressively long filmography, but few if any of the entries thereon have made much impression on the critics.One hopes that in real life security on an US warship would be much tighter than shown here; I was surprised both by the ease with which the terrorists took over the ship and by the ease with which Ryback and his allies recaptured it. Jordan seems magically transformed from a frightened young girl to a one who shows a good deal more courage under fire and skill with a weapon than one would expect from a woman with her particular CV. The film, however, is more about entertainment than about realism, like most films in this goodies-against-baddies tough-guy action-adventure genre. Despite (or perhaps because of) its implausible plots, frequently wooden acting and extreme levels of violence, it was a genre that became very popular in the late eighties and nineties, and remains popular today. This was the a genre that helped to make stars not only of the likes of Seagal, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jean-Claude Van Damm, but also of some rather more accomplished actors such as Mel Gibson.A year later, director Andrew Davis was to go on to achieve a great success with ""The Fugitive"", one of the best crime thrillers of the nineties and a film which also starred Tommy Lee Jones (as well as several other actors from ""Under Siege""). ""Under Siege"" is nowhere near the class of the later film, but it is one of the more entertaining tough-guy adventures. It is not the best of the genre, but it is far from being the worst. 5/10",Under Siege

But seriously this was just way way way too predictable, which a lot of macho flicks are, but at least they have some comedy or fun action sequences to it. First off, the girl who played Miss July, goes from a stupid naked blonde bimbo to a Rambo street smart strong woman? Uh huh. Then Siegal, he tries his comedy jokes, but they were too dry. And the villain, Tommy does good, but he's not too convincing of a bad guy. Over all, I just thought that this was beyond predictable and not that enjoyable.

Then Segal gets out of the cooler and screws up all their plans. There's lots of good action and excitement. To me, these 1992 special effects look much better than the CGI that some later films use. Most of this film concetrates on the action with just a little distraction from a playboy model who is brought in under the guise of popping out of the cake for the Captains Surprise party. She is drugged and out until Segal pushes her cake. From there, she is aboard for the crusade against the bad guys.There's lots of fights, explosions, and action while the joint chiefs fret about the taking of the ship.

It's satisfying seeing him take on the terrorists left and right, giving them a taste of their own medicine.Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Busey play some pretty annoying bad guys and it's great to see them deck it out with Segal. The subplot of the Pentagon generals scrambling in how to deal with the bad guys and the hostage situation gives the movie added suspense, wondering if they will resort to launching an all-out assault on the ship, which puts the hostage sailors in more crisis.I just wished more drama concerning the trapped sailors were added, which overall, it's an exciting action flick that every action movie fans should see!

35,thesar-2,Only the audience is 'Under Siege',2,17 June 2009,"What a truly bad movie 'Under Siege' was. I believe it was one of those advertised as ""Die Hard on a boat!on a plane!...on a train!"" films when in reality it was a blatant rip off of the original 'Die Hard.' And sorry, Steven Seagal fans: even John McClane or Jack Bauer would call him a wuss. Calling this movie predictable, silly, outrageous and containing horrible dialogue is probably a compliment. If it weren't for Tommy Lee Jones doing the best he could with the clichéd (even for 1992) material and the absolutely beautiful shots of the Navy ship, I would've downgraded this movie even further. A special naval chef for the captain of the USS Missouri who (ooooh) holds secrets we simply can't guess until it's forced down our throats later on. Terrorist ""siege"" the vessel for the one thing on all terrorist minds. Well, movie terrorist, that is. Real life terrorist that just want money, don't destroy things; they simply put on a suit and tie and work for US Banks and/or the government. It's up to (never heard this before) a lone special ops to fight off 183 highly trained bad guys. Oh, and he's got a sexy side-kick who was such an incredibly dumb, clichéd, unfunny and predictable character that I would have surely shot her and blamed the terrorist. OK, fine, I'm taking the movie too serious, and again, its fun watching Jones play a baddie. And Seagal does show off some good moves from time to time. Comparatively speaking, this might be his best film to date. Is that saying much? Anything? I guess if you close off your mind completely, forget all the better lone-warrior action flicks, including ANY 'Die Hard' or 'Bourne' film, you might get a snicker out of this.",Under Siege

This is the film's villainous duo and since a movie is as good as the bad guy, that's telling how delightful the film is. That it inspired an enthusiastic review from Roger Ebert (who enjoyed it more than ""Die Hard"") and made Gene Siskel's Top 10 movies of the year should tell you that this is not your average action flick.It's time to mention Steven Seagal. The film belongs to the early 90s when he hadn't sunk into B-territory yet but the bad guys are so good that the film didn't even need a good hero, which is the ideal situation for Steven Seagal. In 41 minutes of screen-time, he gives one of his best shots as Casey Ryback, the ship's cook (but former Navy SEAL) who saves the day. After Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone and Bruce Willis, there have always been remaining sloths for Jean-Claude Van Damme and Steven Seagal but these actors, especially Seagal, never got the credit they deserved. Watching ""Under Siege"", I felt the urge to rewatch ""Out for Justice"" and now, I believe the Seagal of the 90s deserves more respect.He might not have something as iconic as Arnie's accent, or Sly's slurred speech, or the Average Joe appeal of Willis, but there's something about Seagal. It might be his Aikido skills that are as instantly identifiable as Van Damme's swift moves and splits, it might be his high stature, his pony tail, his seeming invincibility or all these factors put together. Seagal looks like the guy you simply can't beat so it's never a matter of outfighting him but on him never reaching you, once he comes, it's over. The trick isn't how hard it'll be to beat him but how ingenuously he'll beat the hell out of every one who dares to fight. With the inventiveness of a McGyver, he can turn every banal object into a deadly weapon (a rope, a poll ball in an apron or a credit card) and without a scratch. Bruce Willis was McClane, Seagal is the Mr. Clean of action films.Of course a review of ""Under Siege"" had a few references to ""Die Hard"" coming, the film was literally taglined ""Die Hard on a battleship"" and it's a good summary as far as advertizing goes, but the great thing about director Andrew Davis is that he never totally sets the story apart from the 'die hard' format and yet never makes it obvious that he was duplicating a model. It's not any battleship but the USS Missouri, the one that avenged Pearl Harbor, the hostages are military and the villains mercenaries and the 'pebble in the shoe"" isn't an average guy, definitely not the standard of hero created by McClane, Ryback has all the makings of a one-man army, making hims closer to Arnie's Matrix, so much that his sidekick, former playmate Jordan Tate (played by Erika Eleniak) said it best ""the safest place in this boat is three feet behind you"". And that a former Playmate ends up in the celebration set in one of the most iconic battleships of America is one of these delightful oddities that make the film.So ""Under Siege"" borrows from many serious thrillers such as ""The Hunt for Red October"", with an attention to every detail that reveals Davis' professionalism, but dares to shows a commander dressed as a woman or mercenaries passing as a rock band or waiters. This is a script with a capability to be enjoyable even during the life and death situations, avoiding the nightmarish feel of ""Die Hard 2"" for instance. You never trivialize what happens but you never forget that you're being entertained. To give you an idea, it's not about whatever Jones and his crew want to do with their torpedoes, but the way they deal with the big shots in the war room, the way Jones handle his contractors and chews the scenery enough to make you doubt about his sanity. Obviously he has fun playing the bad guy and that's the perfect angle, ""Under Siege"" respects the codes of action movies but it has a sharp delightful edge that makes it more than a version of ""Die Hard"", much more.So I liked many things, I loved the bad guys, I loved Jones, he was so good that he paired with Davis again in 1993 with ""The Fugitive"" and won the Oscar for his performance. I also loved the way Eleniak started from being the laod to a worthwhile adjuvant. I liked that just when I thought the film was venturing in the same territory than ""Die Hard"" when the officials doubted Ryback's intentions, he proved them wrong and the Admiral believed every word he said. I loved that moment where in the middle of a gunfight, Jordan asked if they wanted to leave a message. And I loved when Busey (once again) decided to drown his own crew trapped in the forecastle saying ""they never liked me anyway"", that line was good enough but it had to be followed by a hilarious ""I bet they love you know"".And I could tell Jones' cracking up was genuine.",Under Siege
37,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Undercooked.,5,28 July 2020,"'Under Siege (1992)' is a worse version of 'Die Hard (1988)', one that swaps a building for a battleship and a relatable cop with a cardboard cut-out. Steven Seagal leaves something to be desired as the film's lead, an enigmatic chef with a disregard for authority and the ability to kill with his bare hands, as he turns what should be a compelling character into a bland and borderline bizarre one. Seriously, there are scenes in which it seems like he simply stops acting halfway through, resetting himself to a 'blank' position or slowly slinking off frame as the shot holds for longer than it ought to. It really is quite strange. The feature itself is pretty paint-by-numbers and underwhelming, too. Only the occasionally exciting bit of action - and an enjoyable, scene-chewing performance from Tommy Lee Jones - prevents it from being a total bore. Even then, the thing isn't exactly engaging. It's slow, uninspired and - though relatively well-made - uninteresting. 5/10",Under Siege
38,bowmanblue,The best Steven Seagal movie... ever,8,12 March 2015,"Okay, so that's not saying much. Seagal has hardly had a glittering career as far as 'critically acclaimed' movies go. Let's face it... he's a B-movie actor at best (and not always a very good one!). His films normally involve him beating up baddies, as he can throw a pretty decent punch and a kick, although, recently, that's come into question as he's got older! However, 'Under Siege' is one of those movies that is so simple that everything just works. It's impossible to talk about it without mentioning 'Die Hard,' largely because it's basically the same film, but set on a boat. There were even rumours going around in the mid nineties that Under Siege stopped production on Die Hard 3 because the third instalment of the Die Hard franchise was also going to be set on a boat and they didn't think they could outdo Under Siege.Terrorists overtake a US Navy ship. Steven Seagal fights back. That's all you need to know. It's a simple action movie that anyone can understand. It doesn't try to be anything different. There are countless others like it, but few that actually stand the test of time. This one does. Although there isn't really anything I can tell you which really differentiates it from the masses, apart from the fact that it works. If you're in the mood for an action film, watch it. It'll do the job. Yes, there are also pretty decent performances from some of the other cast (mainly Tommy Lee Jones as the – cartoon-obsessed – baddie), but it's the whole package that makes this one stand out from the other.Naturally, after Under Siege's success at the Box Office, a sequel was green-lit. Sadly, lightning didn't strike twice and it was pretty poor and fell into the category of all the other forgettable action B-movies. Just stick to the original. It doesn't try to be anything other than a fun action flick. And, in that, it succeeds totally.",Under Siege
39,CuriosityKilledShawn,Doesn't live up to the sequel,6,8 June 2000,"Despite popular belief, this isn't the big man's best movie. Competent and skillful it may well be but there's far too much espionage and not enough action. It was made in that period of the early to mid-nineties where every action movie was 'Terrorists take over a (fill in the blank)'. In this case it's a Naval Battleship.Gary Busey, always one of the best bad guys ever, is the evil second in command who hates his crew and his captain. But the person he hates most in the entire world is the obnoxious cook Casey Ryback. Well he's an ex-Navy SEAL first and a cook second.Enter William Strannix (Tommy Lee Jones) and his band of mercenaries, disguised as a rock star and busboys, who take over the ship, kill the captain and lock what's left of the crew away. Strannix is hell-bent on blowing up Hawaii and Krill (Gary Busey) plans to sell off the ships nuclear weapons to the Ruskies.But wait...Krill has forgotten about the irritating cook he locked away in the freezer. And Ryback makes it his mission to find out what the hell is going on and put a stop to whatever it is. Erika Eleniak pops up to provide some help and toplessness.I'm not such a fan of the first Under Siege, the sequel is much, much better but they both have their pros and cons. For some reason, Ryback's renegade, rule-breaking personality was played down in Under Siege 2 and Seagal made NO effort at his acting in that film (he hated the idea of a sequel). However Under Siege 2 is much faster, has 50 times as much action, is way more exciting, has a higher sense of escapism and atmosphere (compared to the repetitive battleship scenes in this one) and has better villains.I know you'll disagree with me on the last point. But Strannix and Krill seem too over the top and seem to be acting up to the camera compared to the sequel with Travis Dane's wild eccentrics and Penn's icy, emotionless stare. Plus, Strannix's constant Looney Tunes references were totally out of place and distracting.Well all know Steven Seagal is good with the martial arts, so it's kind of odd that he simply shoots most of the bad guys in this movie. In Under Siege 2 he chops, slices, breaks, burns, chucks, slashes, strangles, explodes, smashes and crushes. It makes for a great movie is definitely the clear winner over this one.The DVD has a great looking 1.85:1 anamorphic picture with a loud and impressive Dolby 5.1 track. 8 trailers for Steven Seagal films are included. The R1 version still comes in a cruddy snap case but the R2 version now comes in a sturdy keep case, complete with lovely Warner hologram. If you have a multi-region DVD player, get this one.",Under Siege
40,callanvass,One Of The Best Die Hard Clones Out There!,10,16 April 2005,"This is one of the best Die Hard clones out there,with an excellent performance from Seagal!. While it's not as good as Cliffhanger,Sudden Death,Die Hard or any of the die hard sequels, it's still an awesome one, and it's action packed throughout!. I can't say it's Seagal's best because i haven't seen all of his films, still i wouldn't be surprised if it was, due to 2 fantastic villains in Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Busey!, and a game Steven Seagal!. Maybe i'm just a sucker for these Die Hard kind of movies, but i really do enjoy them and this one was no different. If your an action movie lover (like me) then this is a no brainer,if not stay away!, also it's worth watching for people who think Seagal can't act!. The Direction is great. Andrew Davis does a great job here, with great camera work, some good overhead shots, and overall keeping the film at a very very fast pace!, great job. There is TONS of violence!. We get tons of extremely bloody gunshot wounds, a few bloody gunshot wounds to the head,knives in the neck and body,corpse,with knives in it's face,a very gory impaling, with a huge piece of wood,lots of bloody stabbings,slicing and dicing,gouged out eye,and a knife in the top of the head. The Acting is AWESOME!. Steven Seagal is fantastic here, and gives the best performance i have seen from him yet, he likable, had decent chemistry with Erika Eleniak, kicked that ass, and was lots of fun to watch! (Seagal rules!). Tommy Lee Jones is tremendous as one of the main villains, he has some really cool dialog, was extremely menacing, and really seemed to be enjoying himself!, he was awesome. Gary Busey, is also excellent as one of the main villains, and does what he does best play a psycho!, he was very menacing. Erika Eleniak is very pretty and does fine with what she has to do. Rest of the cast is fine. Overall a must see this instant! i can't wait for Under Siege 2!. ***** out of 5(Barely)",Under Siege
41,tabuno,An Engaging Action Thriller That Has Been Superceded Since,7,7 May 2021,"This action thriller holds up relatively well after nearly thirty years as a sea-based Die Hard (1988) version. Well-paced and with reasonable storyline, Steven Seagal carries most of the movie along with the typical outlandish delightful and nasty behavior of Tommy Lee Jones. There are a few minor weaknesses in the plot like where are the bombers when you really need them and how can one so quickly and easily repair a broken electrical system and some such. The use of the Missouri battleship is credible and wide-ranging. However, the movie has all the popularized action elements that were required of such movies the last century and have since tightened into a more serious and consistent action movie tone such as found in the exhilarating and gripping Hunter Killer (2018) using a Virginia-class submarine, the USS Arkansas and a special operation team in a fascinating parallel action thriller movie.",Under Siege

Seagal, minus his trademark ponytail delivers his strongest performance so far. Considering he is the main star, and the only face on the poster he is only onscreen for 41 minutesAs is usually the case, Tommy Lee Jones simply steals the show he is superb, vile and deliriously insaneGary Busey is wonderfully over the top and my own personal favourite Baywatch babe Erika Elaniak is Miss July 1989 Jordan Tate an awfully cliche character who is given awful things to say like ""I have two rules. I do not date musicians and I do not kill people"" and ""He is in a gunfight, you'll have to leave a message""I think this is great, easily his best movie it's just so much fun. Andrew Davis is not a director I hear people talking about often, but he has an impressive body of work:Code Of Silence is one of the best movies Chuck Norris made, The Package was a terrific Gene Hackman thriller, and he directed Seagal's debut in Above The Law. After this he would direct Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones in The Fugitive, Arnold in Collateral Damage and Kevin Costner in The Guardian.Under Siege opened at number 1 at the domestic Box Office (his 5th in a row) and grossed $83 million (on a $35 million budget) to end 1992 as the 13th highest grossing movie of the year.Seagal really looked like he was on his way to becoming an A List Action star.",Under Siege
43,paulclaassen,Better than expected actioner.,6,11 February 2021,"'Under Siege' might play like 'Die Hard' at sea, but this film actually really surprised me. It was darn good!The plot revolves around a group of ex-military officials and soldiers who hijack a warship in order to sell its cargo (ammunition), and they ain't showin' no mercy! The opening scenes were fun and lively, before all hell broke loose. The film then becomes relentless, with lots of action, and a few nasty and brutal scenes as well.'Under Siege' features good performances by a veteran cast. I thought Tommy Lee Jones in particular was very good as the antagonist. In addition, Steven Seagal was good as the protagonist, and makes a credible hero. I must be honest I didn't like Jordan (Erika Elaniak) at all. She was an annoying character who mostly served as comic relief. Although her character vastly improved over the course of the movie, I still think it would have done better without her. (And do you honestly expect me to believe she fell asleep inside a cake and didn't here any of the commotion??

45,tarbosh22000,One of the main reasons Under Siege stays afloat is the cast,6,20 March 2018,"When a team of baddies led by the diabolical William Strannix (Jones) takes over a battleship, the USS Missouri, with the goal of stealing the Tomahawk missiles contained onboard, things don't look good for the crew of the ship or the stateside higher-ups. When a helicopter carrying SEAL Team 5 sent to save the ship doesn't make it, Strannix appears to be on the verge of accomplishing his mission. He just didn't count on one thing: Casey Ryback (Seagal). Ryback is the self-described ""lowly, lowly cook"" on the vessel, but the truth is that he's a highly-trained SEAL himself with more than enough know-how to singlehandedly bring down the evil plans of the bad guys. Tagging along with Ryback is Jordan Tate (Eleniak), Playboy's ""Miss July '89"" (which Eleniak was in real life as well). Hey, if you fall asleep in a giant cake you're supposed to pop out of, strange things happen. Will Ryback stop Strannix and his plans for world domination? You probably already know the answer...
Under Siege is mainstream Hollywood action that even people who are not typically action movie fans have seen. It was wildly popular at the time, despite the fact that it's the first Seagal movie to break with the ""Three Word Title"" tradition. Seagal re-teamed with Above the Law (1988) director Davis - who also directed Chuck Norris in Code of Silence (1985) - and the results have that glossy, professional Hollywood sheen to it that even action movie ""noobs"" will find palatable. The fact that Davis's next film was The Fugitive (1993) makes sense; it's a natural extension of the groundwork laid down with Under Siege. 
Most of the street-level grit found in the early clutch of Seagal titles such as Out For Justice (1991) is missing here, presumably in a bid to garner a larger audience. It seems to have worked, even though Seagal's viewing public was already pretty darn huge at the time. While the movie does lose a bit of steam towards the end because it doesn't have to be as long as it is, all in all Under Siege is solid. It's nothing to go wild about, but it's like the USS Missouri itself: big, solidly built, steady, and professionally cared-for. To Under Siege's eternal credit, it's not a submarine slog, bogey slog, ship slog, or any other kind of slog, which it easily could have been. It's simply what we call a ""DieHardInA"" movie, which were everywhere in the 90's. It seemed every time you turned around, terrorist bad guys were taking over buildings, ships, nuclear plants, water treatment facilities, PathMarks, Waldenbookses, CompUSA's or any other kind of structure that holds human beings. For a more in-depth look at the 90's DieHardInA trend, please see our review of Sudden Death. In that case it was a hockey rink, in case anyone needed reminding. 
One of the main reasons Under Siege stays afloat (sorry) is the cast. First off, we have our old buddy Seagal, who is actually pretty likable here and you do root for him. He's backed up by the spunky Eleniak as his sidekick, and on the baddie side we have Tommy Lee Jones, who of course is excellent as the evil Strannix, and he has Gary Busey as his sidekick. Now that's a power-team if there ever was one. Colm Meaney as another bad guy adds color, as do other incidental characters played by familiar faces such as Bernie Casey, George Cheung, Nick Mancuso, Andy Romano, and Dale Dye, among many others. Interestingly, Tommy Lee Jones gets into a knife fight with Seagal in the climactic battle, and Jones also played a knife expert in The Hunted (2003), and those to date are the only two TLJ movies on Comeuppance. Overall, by our standards at least, the violence is relatively toned-down. Sure, Seagal tears somebody's throat out and shoves another guy into a circular saw, but somehow it all feels more muted than usual. 
Under Siege was perhaps the peak of Seagal's Hollywood career and is not bad by any means. It's a bit mainstream for our personal taste but if you're trying to get a non-action fan into action movies, this is a good and easy way to break them in to the genre.",Under Siege

50,Anonymous_Maxine,"Yes, Steven Seagal actually came out with an action movie worth watching.",9,6 February 2001,"Sure, Seagal played the typical role that he always plays  a cook on a marine vessel, in this case. Evidently the job requirements to hold his position on the ship were things like advanced culinary degrees in cooking and food preparation, as well as minors in knife-throwing, martial arts, and general ass-kicking. Luckily, we find out later that he was previously a Navy Seal of some sort who was forced into the position he now holds because he was wrongly accused and prosecuted long ago, but wanted to stay with the Navy. Erika Eleniak co-stars as Jordan Tate, the dancer hired to jump out of the cake topless for the captain's birthday party. She also delivers one of the very few half-decent performances by a Playboy model (ever see Anna Nicole Smith in any of her films?).However, in Under Siege, it is Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Busey who collectively steal the show. These two guys work together nearly as well as Riggs and Murtaugh in the great Lethal Weapon series, except that now they're bad guys. It's a little bit odd now to see Tommy Lee Jones playing a bad guy, but he's such a skilled actor that he can pull it off perfectly. They also provide some of the best comic relief seen in recent years. I particularly liked the scene where Jones and Busey break into the captain's office, and Busey reads a memo written by the captain, saying that Busey may need a psychological evaluation. Keep in mind that Busey was dressed as a woman in this scene (for reasons which you'll just have to watch the movie to find out), which makes it hilarious as he furiously asks Jones, `Do I look like I need a psychological evaluation?!'The story deals with a nuclear weapons heist, which is a pretty tired premise by now, but it is made entertaining by the good performances, stunts, direction, and script. The fairly brutal violence in this film is balanced by just the right amount of comic relief, which could come at seemingly any moment, such as when Rieback (Seagal) was locked in the meat locker and was trying to get the naïve soldier to let him out (`Take my pies out of the oven!').(spoilers) However, the movie did contain its share of action movie clichés. There were plenty of goofy one-liners, some of which were funny, and some of which just should not have been left in the movie, such as Rieback's final line in the film (`Here's one move'), which nearly ruined the movie on its own. And, of course, there could never be an action film with a big-breasted blonde like Eleniak without the hero getting the girl (in the cheesiest way possible, in this case). But before you label Under Siege as ""yet another Seagal film,"" compare it to the mind-numbing crap that he usually comes out with. Despite tasteless things like this that were thrown carelessly into the film, Under Siege still succeeded on many more levels (a Seagal movie worth watching!!), making it a worthwhile action film.",Under Siege

Their plan is to launch these 4 tomahawks, which will kill loads of innocent people. They are led by a disgruntled, CIA agent, in a brilliant over the top crazed performance, by Tommy Lee Jones where his scenes come as a sheer delight.

Seagal has assistance, ex Baywatch beauty (Elena Eleniak) as a failed actress, and Ms July, with big, you know.... which apparently, this is her third acting gig, where she adds female eye candy to this well made actioner. There's a lot of gunfire and explosions, in Seagal's fifth film, which was considered his best, so far, where today, it would be the same, especially if you regard the straight to video dreck, he does, lately, where he's now playing baddies more. His other one, alongside that is the other Davis film, Nico. He is a hopeless actor, where Tommy Lee Jones presence, is such a well of relief. There are some nasty bloody moments, like Jones's eye being popped, by Steve's big thumb, and a restricted shot of an arm going through a band saw. That informative scene between both foes, mirrors a familiar one in Nico, where in this scene Seagal's first three words make for a memorable tagline. It would of been good to see Seagal take on Busey, especially after he hocked in Seagal's soup, but it just wouldn't be much of a fight, now would it.

It is seminal.A film beyond categorisation,blurring the boundaries between genres,defying those small minds who must cast every movie into one or other of the accepted frames of reference.The fact that it was ignored by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences,the British Film Academy,the Cannes Film Festival,the Venice Film Festival and every other self-regarding reactionary committee of small-minded short-sighted Luddites says far more about them than it does about ""Under Siege"".",Under Siege

The government's best hope lies in the fists of Casey Ryback (Seagal), a cook with a background as an ex-SEAL who was placed on the USS Missouri to finish out his 20-year tour in the galley following a scuffle with his officer-in-charge.So why should you care about Seagal, or his hottest action flick to date? First off, anyone expecting anything even remarkable such as a change of character for Seagal will be sorely disappointed. He plays his usual wronged hero archetype here, as well as the vengeance-seeking wrist-breaker, but he does so in a way like he knows the layout of the story and just runs with it. And Lawton's screenplay also supplies him and his cohorts with an arsenal of firepower, and one-liners that do warrant some carefully placed chuckles. Dragged into the fray with Seagal, are a couple of Missouri crew buddies, and a former Playboy Playmate hottie, Erika Eleniak as Jordan Tate, a.k.a. Miss July '89.On the flip-side away from our star, we have the villains played with cackling, over-the-top precision by Jones and Busey, who play off one another, have some of the coolest lines, and give the best performances in the whole movie. At the helm, director Davis keeps a pace that is almost in sync with his later ""The Fugitive"" (1993), which would feature another star-making performance by Mr. Jones.Of course, ""Under Siege"" has the best action sequences of any Steven Seagal movie, with plenty of scenes of him shooting up the bad guys, dodging bullets as if he was Superman, and even has a titanic kung-fu knife fight. Sure, it still takes its cues from ""Die Hard"" (1988) and the many knock-offs that have tried to imitate it, but ""Under Siege"" knows where it's going, and so do we.10/10",Under Siege

His niche was playing cops, but Under Siege saw him stretching his wings a bit. No, it's not Shakespeare, but Segal gets to show a little range beyond mumbly one-liners aimed at vaguely ethnic street toughs and he acquits himself pretty well. It helps that he's surrounded by a strong cast, including Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Busey.*sidebar* Jones, Busey and Segal, all on the same set? Man, it's like the Mount Rushmore of crazy.It's your standard ""Die Hard on/in a..."" scenario, but it's handled w/reasonable skill by director Andrew Davis (The Fugitive).

However, they've vastly underestimated the ability of ex-Navy Seal turned cook Casey Ryback who is determined to stop the terrorists in their tracks....Die Hard on a ship is basically what Under Siege is and whilst I had no realistic expectations of this being as good as Die Hard I didn't expect Under Siege to be as underwhelming as it turned out to be either....I'll start with some of the positives with this film; firstly, director Andrew Davis does provide some half-decent action sequences and some half-decent acting performances (although as is the case with most films of this type it is the villains who provide us with the better performances). These things prevent the film from being boring and make the film just about watchable. On the other hand though as the film only boasts half-decent acting and half-decent action sequences Under Siege is never quite a good film and is a long way off being brilliant. It lacks the claustrophobia and excitement of Die Hard and saddled with Seagal in the lead Under Siege is largely charisma-free and a little cold. Erika Eleniak is pretty and is seen topless in one scene, but she too is rather vacuous and bland and doesn't add much to the film (aside from the obvious of course). The villains of the piece are better, but are somewhat limited by the material and never come across as being particularly terrifying.The main issue with Under Siege is that it is so mechanical, safe and by-the-numbers that it becomes a film that you just look at for the explosions and martial arts choreography; there's no real heart to the picture or reason to care about anything that happens. Perhaps with a different lead and a different director Under Siege may have been a better film, but as it is the film feels a bit half-baked and unmemorable.",Under Siege

The only thing that scared me was when the bad guys were searching for her. If you ask me, Casey (Steven Seagal) was a really tough guy when it came to fighting off villains. I just have to say that Andrew Davis has scored a huge hit. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that the performances were superior, the production design was beautiful, the cast was perfectly chosen, and the costumes were perfectly designed.

60,I_Ailurophile,Dubious action classic,5,19 June 2021,"It's taken me 29 years to watch 'Under siege,' the greatest legacy of action hero Steven Seagal, for the first time. Was it worth the wait?I guess you could do worse.Even in a genre where movies are outrageously over the top, the plot and general writing here strike me as especially ham-handed. Occasionally it's lightly funny, as when Miss July '89 (Erika Eleniak) forces Ryback (Seagal) to take her along with him because she doesn't like being alone. J. F. Lawton's writing also paves the way for Tommy Lee Jones to chew plentiful scenery as antagonist Strannix, to an extent perhaps second only to his turn as Two-Face in 'Batman Forever.'On the other hand, the exaggerated action, dialogue, and characterizations are weirdly restrained and subdued, as though 'Under siege' is intended to be not just tongue-in-cheek, but maybe an altogether deadpan parody. The same goes for the music of composer Gary Chang. Yet one-liners that should elicit a laugh fall flat. As an action movie it should be exciting, or as a comedy it should be funny, but instead it's just kind of dull. It's well done from a technical standpoint, and reasonably entertaining, but it doesn't capture the imagination in the way that a good movie should.And that's to say nothing of the desperately hackneyed ending, where the hero gets the girl and in the last scene gives a hoity-toity salute. Blech.I do like the supporting cast. Wild as Jones is in his role, he's great, and I'll never say no to seeing Colm Meaney in anything. While theirs are even smaller roles, I like seeing Raymond Cruz here, and Bernie Casey. Gary Busey is reliably obnoxious; Seagal is... well, as wooden as is to be expected. Although in this case he's not alone, because whether it's down to Lawton's writing or Andrew Davis' direction, most of the supporting cast moves and speaks with such muted lack of dynamics - echoing the flavor of the film generally - that one would be forgiven for thinking that everyone on set got stoned before the cameras began rolling.'Under siege' isn't altogether bad. But words like ""riveting,"" ""engaging,"" or ""thrilling,"" that should be readily applicable to an action flick, feel pointedly inappropriate. It's a slim hair above ""cookie cutter"" material. I can understand how this movie fits neatly into a genre where mindless action reigns supreme, but I see little appeal in it otherwise.I tried to keep my expectations in check, but I'm still a bit disappointed. Worth watching for Tommy Lee Jones - not a bad way to pass the time so long as you're not particularly discerning about what you watch - but not really a title I feel I'm able to recommend.",Under Siege

He, and most of the crew by the way, dislikes his second in command Cmdr Krill (Busey), and frequently quarrels with him. The captain of the ship, a firm supporter of Ryback's, has a birthday coming up and Krill has caterers, a band and Jordan Tate (Eleniak), a playmate, flown in to surprise the captain. But everything is not as it seems. The band and caterer, with singer Stranix (Lee Jones) in the lead are in fact mercenaries in league with Cmdr Krill. Stranix is a former CIA agent gone rogue and with Krill he is about to Steal all the nuclear warheads on the ship. The entire ship's crew is taken hostage and everything seems to be under the control of the mercenaries. But they seem to have forgotten Casey Ryback...Comments: This is a good action, nothing more. Seagal is very good as the competent and most deadly Ryback. Lee Jones, on the other end of the good bad spectra is great as the evil unstable equally deadly mastermind. This movie does not pretend to be better than it is, and that's a strength. The fights and shoot outs are good and there are a somewhat interesting relationship between Ryback and Tate. Both Eleniak and Busey, by the way, give nice performances. In conclusion, this is a perfect movie for an evening when your mind want a night off...6/10",Under Siege

Who could ever have sold the idea of an ex-Navy Seal-turned-cook could ever kick that much butt in any movie. No one. Segal's tongue in cheek performance was great, talking like he had something to prove in just about every line, trying not to crack a smile due to the cracker-jack dialogue that was created for this specific role. Tommy Lee Jones, Colm Meaney and Erika Eleniak were all okay in this film, but Segal was clearly what made this film. What especially made everything enjoyable in this film was the lack of artistry.

63,valleyjohn,Tommy Lee Jones taking the piss,6,21 March 2021,"There is no doubt that there is a lot of love for Under Siege . Back in the day it was seen as Steven Seagal's best movie ( which is isn't saying a lot ) and most men absolutely loved the testosterone filled action . The problem is, I didn't see it back in the day and this is the first time I've watched it...I guess you had to be there .It's an easy plot to follow , basically Steven Seagal plays an ex-Navy Seal , turned cook who is the only person who can stop a group of terrorists when they seize control of a U.S. battleship.I have to congratulate Under Siege for one thing . It's years since I watched a film where so many actors chew up the scenery with there over the top acting .
It goes without saying that Seagal is bad . He's never been able to act but Tommy Lee Jones . What was he playing at?
His portrayal of William Strannix is as camp as a row of pink tents and quite frankly is embarrassing bad .
Gary Busey is even out hammed in the acting department and that's saying a lot .It was actually filmed on the decommissioned U.S.S Missouri which looks great it's just a shame that the action didn't live up to the setting . I was expecting so many really good choreographed kick ass action set pieces but I found it extremely disappointing. Perhaps we've been spoilt in recent years with fight scenes In action movies?There is one memorable scene where the beautiful Erika Eleniak pops out of a cake naked which definitely held my interest. It's just a shame that the rest of the film didn't have the same affect on me .",Under Siege
64,Samiam3,"Macho, amusing and dumb. (Good for some, but not for all)",6,1 January 2010,"Kicking butt is nothing special to movies which is why Under Siege is nothing special, the question is whether the movie can provide pleasure to anyone other than Seagal fans. The answer is...possibly. For a 21st century audience it seems a little dubious considering that action goers don't go for anything less explosive than Michael Bay, or Roland Emmerich. Under Siege is no match for either of them in terms of spectacle, but then again, it is not nearly as loud or obnoxious either. A well choreographed fight scene can be far more engaging than watching New York Blow up. If you Seagal is not your reason for viewing this movie, the only way one can love a film like this is if you see it before watching any of the following films: The Die Hard series, The Lethal Weapon Series, and maybe The Hunt for Red October. Under Siege is basically borrows the same formula without adding anything except Seagal.Seagal is Casey Ryback, a former SEAL officer and now the cook on board, the USS Missouri which is departing on it's final voyage (before retirement). It is the Captains birthday and to celebrate a group of Hawaian entertainers (including miss June) are flown in via chopper. Come evening the party is well under way, but suddenly it gets nasty when the entertainers put on a much bigger show, pulling out there guns and high jacking the ship, at the command of traitorous Commander Krill (next in command aboard the ship). All the crew gets locked up expect for Ryback (due to a very silly circumstance). Krill plans a nuclear strike on the United States, and now it's up to him to save the day. Along the way he gets some unusual help.The movie uses all the clichés of an all American hero film, especially during the climax, which features overly used lines such as 'Your plan wont cause any change' and what not. Under Siege is in no way weak (except maybe intellectually) but it is not so much exciting as it is amusing. There is little in the way of tension, because we just know that the ending is going to be happy, there are a couple of intentional as well as unintentional laughs along the way, But Steven Segal does kick butt in this movie which is all that the film intends to offer. That doesn't mean however that it is an action film of praise.",Under Siege
65,alexanderdavies-99382,An exciting bit of escapism!,8,7 May 2018,"I'm not the biggest fan of Steven Seagal - he's made too many rubbish films and his physical changes haven't helped.
 However, he found a winner with ""Under Siege."" The film packs a lot into its 98 minute running time and it rushes by.
 The plot is fairly standard and includes all kinds of ""superhero"" type heroics. What makes it work, is the direction from Andrew Davis, the action scenes, the photography and production values but also the performance of Tommy Lee Jones. All you have to do, is to compare his acting with the feeble attempts of Steven Seagal for it to be painfully obvious who the actor is!
 Most of Steven Seagal's martial arts movies are pretty low budget and have never been given a huge release. ""Under Siege"" is an exception. Thanks to the films various credentials, the box office takings were bound to be better than usual.
 Gary Busey does well as an unbalanced villain (they had become his stock in trade long before).",Under Siege

Honest.If the viewer can groove to that level of lunacy, he or she will be amply rewarded by a film that takes all the formulaic conventions of the genre and pushes them to the edge of credibility. The movie is wholly unbelievable, but the pacing is so rapid and so well handled, the audience has little time for skepticism.

69,screenman,Segal's Best Outing.,7,20 April 2008,"Steven Segal has very little to offer in the acting stakes. Like Jean-Claude Van Damme, he's a one-dimensional tough-guy: Bruce Willis without the gags and fags: the sort of right-minded no-nonsense hard-case that gives most normal men an inferiority complex, and feel guilty that they don't spend more time at the gym. It's down to the director to build enough interest around him during any movie within which he stars, to offset his lack of talent. Mostly, they don't work, unless you happen to be a fan of up-tight testosterone-topped Alpha males. 'Under Siege' does work. I suspect that is because Segal is outshone by the real star of the movie - the colossal American Battleship. Considering that these vessels were the very last of the WW2 giants, they have been a very under-utilised asset either from the standpoint of action movie or even documentary. Capital ships really were amazingly beautiful works of engineering art. Whatever one's views upon war may be, they have a grace and symmetry unequalled since the days of sail. And if I have a complaint about this movie, it is that we see too little of the ship, especially whole-vessel photography. What we do see is pretty unimaginative, and I suspect that this is because most of the shooting took place on a retired vessel that was permanently at anchor. Even so, I think a lot more could have been done. There is a very good cast adding additional tonnage to an othewise buoyant story. Tommy Lee Jones plays a manifestly deranged bad guy, leading a gang of sundry cut-throats who have hijacked the warship. Otherwise it's Segal's slaughter by stealth pass-card through and through. You must have seen it a dozen times by now. An additional and largely unnecessary dimension is added by a pneumatic blonde bimbo. She is (literally) a piece of party furniture and rises out of a cake with her flamboyant - one might even say bovine - assets presented to full effect. Her acting abilities are even worse than Segal's, and as she spends much of the movie in his company, he sometimes begins to look competent if only by contrast. And that's about it. Bad people get shot, stabbed, blown up and winnowed down to the their homicidal and treasonable leaders for the final and inevitable denouement. There's an equally inevitable heavy-rock incidental soundtrack to emphasise testosterone issues. And the all-American way prevails. But the movie is good fun for all of that. You are left in no doubt from the DVD cover that it's a Steven Segal vehicle. Just don't expect many surprises.",Under Siege

Missouri before its to be decommissioned at Pearl Harbor, the ship is seized by deranged rogue CIA asset William Strannix (Tommy Lee Jones) and equally deranged Commander Krill (Gary Busey) who are intent on stealing the Missouri's payload of Tomahawk missiles for sale on the black market. Former S.E.A.L. turned ship's cook Casey Ryback (Steven Seagal) is overlooked during the takeover is overlooked during the takeover and now only he can foil the hijacker's insane plans.Released in 1992, Under Siege was part of a wave of action thrillers that tried to copy the formula established by Die Hard where terrorists take over ""something"" and only ""someone"" can stop them(Speed, Cliffhanger, Sudden Death, etc.). Opening to not only great box office and surprisingly good reviews (even Gene Siskel put it at #10 on his 10 best list for that particular year) the movie not only gave legitimacy to Seagal as an action star after headlining some successful but low budget action films, but also helped director Andrew Davis' clout as an action director leading him to higher profile material like The Fugitive. While Seagal is still his usual....self, the movie wisely builds the movie around him to compensate with a terrific supporting cast, tense direction, and an all around good time that never takes itself too seriously.The villains in the movie are incredible in their performances. Tommy Lee Jones is fantastic as William Strannix who's gone over the edge and sports a look somewhere between a hippie and a biker from Easy Rider and his manic energy is pitch perfect for the movie. Likewise Gary Busey as Commander Krill is gleefully evil playing an unlikable XO who's not only disliked by the crew, but seems proud of that fact. Colm Meaney is also quite good playing Daumer who despite being the most no nonsense and grounded of the three still makes himself memorable thanks to his acerbic delivery that tells us not only is he the smartest guy in the room, he knows it.The direction is incredibly well done with effective use of the ship's narrow corridors, pitch perfect editing that gives accurate spacial geography of not just gunfights but where things are happening on the ship, and well maintained tension. The supporting cast are equally good with Erika Eleniak playing a playboy centerfold who reluctantly teams up with Ryback and makes a good comic foil without falling into the trap of being annoying or useless. Seagal himself is still very much what's expected, but unlike previous projects his screen time is more limited (appearing in about 41 minutes out of 100) and he never becomes grating or irritating thanks to being balanced out by a more than capable supporting cast.Under Siege is a solid action thriller that despite a less than charismatic lead manages to elevate itself thanks to solid villains, action, and technique.

Now only Ryback is undetected and can save the lives of his colleagues.In one of his earlier roles, Seagal performs acceptably in a typical action thriller, which reminded me somewhat of Die Hard.With one major setting, and a central character that is sneaking around unnoticed under the enemy's nose, it's John McClane on a boat, though John had more swagger and more personality.Though its filled with clichés, predictability and unrealistic action sequences, Under Siege still keeps viewers hooked on the edge of their seats as new deadly situations arise with a great villain in Stranix, played with great enthusiasm and sophistication by Tommy Lee Jones (The Fugitive).It's a tense film and the whole concept of the take over is great and tense, but is still Die Hard all over in my personal opinion. without the money and the wife The tense action sequences and general idea of the film, plus Tommy Lee Jones equals an entertaining action film which is consistent throughout.Average support is given by Gary Busey and Erika Eleniak, though not very convincing.The action sequences are directed well to create excellent tension and with a cool sophisticated hero in Seagal, the film justifies the genre well.Though as with many action thrillers, there is many close calls which doesn't generate realism but if you like Die Hard then you will either feel cheated by this similar ideology, or will love it.The ending was atrocious with predictability all over from the start and did take the edge off the film a bit for me, but in conclusion, is still an entertaining fast paced worth watching thriller.",Under Siege

The films tap into our blood lust whilst simultaneously remind us that even in the darkest periods of our lives, it's possible to survive against all odds. It's comforting actually.Anyway, out of all the action films in the world today, the best one by a mile is often regarded as being Bruce Willis in ""Die Hard"". Brilliantly acted with an evil performance by Alan Rickman, it is the ultimate action story.Aside from Bruce though, who else really is that good in action films? One film which showed that there are alternatives is this one, ""Under Siege"". Starring the truly awful Steven Seagal, it is a brilliant film because like ""Die Hard"" you can't help but feel drawn to it. It's a classic, and rightfully so.As cook aboard an American battleship, Casey Ryback (Seagal) is more than happy to stay in his kitchen out of harms way. When an attack is made on the ship however, led by the deranged William Stranix (Tommy Lee Jones), it is up to Ryback to remember his Navy Seal training and save the day once again.Steven Seagal is NOT a good actor. In fact, point blank, the guy is awful. He can't deliver a line to save his life, he has no emotion, and he's generally useless at it. One thing he is superb at though is choreographed fighting and the martial arts. Travelling through the ship shooting, stabbing and maiming the enemy, Seagal is unstoppable and always fun to watch. Out of all his films, the one example where Seagal's special skills are matched with a truly evil villain and a suitably violent plot is this film. Yes, despite Seagal ruining every line he delivers, ""Under Siege"" is really good entertainment.Just like in ""Die Hard"", there is a fundamental reason for the brilliance of this film. Just like Alan Rickman in the other film, with Tommy Lee Jones we have a bad guy worth watching. Jones is perfect in his role as the psychotic Stranix, a man who is has been let down by the system and so wants to make a bit of money and get some revenge at the same time. He laughs, he cackles, he randomly waves his gun around, Jones is exactly what you want in a bad guy and he delivers with style.As Tommy Lee Jones' henchmen Colm Meaney and Gary Busey are both also up to the tasks put upon them. Both actors, screen regulars and quality actors in their own rights, are great as they strut around the ship, Meaney with a purpose, and Busey even more psychopathically than Jones. Combined with their leader, it is the ultimate evil trio and it works inexplicably well.Once you've considered the enemy and your main star, the one key feature behind an action film is how the enemy dies. Just like in ""Die Hard"", ""Under Siege"" gives us a superb variety. There's the characters who just get shot, there are those who are gratuitously killed and there are those who are killed to allow a 'good' character to go through a renaissance. All different types are on display here, and it's hard not to smile as certain people meet their maker.It's hard not to like specific action films. Classic affairs like ""Die Hard"" and ""Under Siege"". These films are the cornerstone of so many DVD collections and they are always something fun to put on when you want minimal plot and plenty of violence. In ""Under Siege"" we are given it all. We are given a woeful actor who is a lethal weapon, we are given three superb bad guys, and we are given countless different deaths. When you want to relax and satisfy your blood lust, there is little else you could possibly ask for.",Under Siege
79,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,Seagal in top-form,8,7 October 2004,"This is the pinnacle of Seagal's career as an action star. This and the sequel. All of his other work is, in general, either OK or, as he has lately demonstrated quite bad.The story kicks off with a hijacking of a battleship with nuclear capabilities by Tommy Lee Jones and his band of goons. However, he soon realizes that Seagal, playing the ship's cook (wtf!?), is onboard to give 'em hell. That is a pretty funny combination of things, especially when the cover the terrorists use to board the ship is a birthday party for the captain with, among others, a playboy model. All that put together with good production values and good action scenes makes for none other than a good action movie that stands well above Seagal's other movies. 8/10",Under Siege
80,Maziun,Take my pies out of the oven,7,23 February 2014,"After his breakthrough movie ""Above the law"" which was a nice action flick Seagal made a trio of bad (at least for me) movies : ""Hard to kill"" , ""Marked for death"" and ""Out for justice"". The production values of those products were unimpressive (they looked like a TV movies) and they all felt like one and the same movie thanks to the lazy screenplays. Thankfully Andrew Davis ( director of ""Above the law"") came to save Seagal career and together they made ""Under siege"" – easily Seagal's best movie to date.The production values are good . It's one of few Segal's big budget movies ( along with ""On deadly ground"", ""Under siege 2 "" , ""Executive decision"" and ""Exit wounds""). While the big budget doesn't automatically mean good movie it allows the viewer to feel a touch of epic cinema. In terms of story there's nothing original here . It's another ""Die hard"" clone , this time on battleship. However it's one of the best ""Die hard"" clones out there . While the story here is quite predictable (because it was done to death before and after this movie ) it's still entertaining. The writer puts quite a lot of humor and irony into this movie. Steven Seagal is Casey Ryback an ex-Navy Seal who is on board as the captains personal cook. He is the only person who can stop terrorists from using the nuclear weapons. Sounds funny ? Yes , and it could easily turn into unintentional autoparody of itself (like Van Damme's awful ""Sudden death"") . Thankfully ""Under siege"" neither treats itself too seriously or too silly.Steven Seagal is no actor , but he is watchable here. Seagal looks relaxed here , often smiles and has some nice one-liners . Along with ""Above the law"" this is his best performance. The movie gives him female sidekick played by Erika Eleniak . She looks great (we get a chance to see her breasts) and gives a decent performance. Interesting thing – she actually was Playboy Playmate of the Month for July 1989 just as the movie says. Another interesting thing – Seagal doesn't defeat the bad guys all alone. He needs help from few other people and that was a refreshing thing to see.The show however belongs to two veteran actors : Tommy Lee Jones (""The Fugitive"") and Gary Busey (""Lethal weapon""). They play villains and they are obviously the most colorful and charismatic characters in the movie. They are little over – the –top , but never overdone it. The action is a high point here. Some Seagal fans might be a little disappointed because it doesn't contain that many aikido moves like his other movies. Still there is enough brutal violence , shootouts , death traps , explosions and a good knife fight to make every action movie junkie happy. The direction by Andrew Davis is top notch . Harrison Ford watched this film while he was deciding whether to take on the lead role in ""The Fugitive"", which had Davis already set to direct. Ford was greatly impressed by Davis' work here and immediately accepted that role. 9 nine actors from ""US"" , including Tommy Lee Jones appeared in ""TF"". The sound is also impressive (2 Oscar nominations). The only bad thing is Gary Chang's bland and completely forgettable score. ""Under siege "" is the best movie of Steven Seagal. It's a good , fun popcorn movie definitely worth watching. I give it 7/10.",Under Siege
81,RonellSowes,Weaker Derivative,4,9 April 2021,"I think its unanimously known that Under Siege is one of the many derivatives/knock-offs of Die Hard. Only in this case it's on the USS Missouri and with a cook.The film tries to use everything at its disposal to prevent it from just being Steven creeping through a ship killing guys-but that's pretty much what it is. Any contortions to the plot are paper thin and don't succeed in really fleshing out this film. It essentially is a one track film that doesn't expand far off the logline. However, with some sturdy performances from Steven Seagal and Tommy Lee Jones and passable filmmaking, it's a watchable action flick.",Under Siege
82,grahamsj3,Action aplenty,6,30 January 2004,"BUT! The story just falls flat. Steven Segal stars in this film about a madmans plot to take over a US battleship. Once the action begins, there is more than enough to go around. I'm not sure where this one goes wrong. Certainly the budget wasn't very high for this film and maybe it just seems cheaply made. As I said, I can't quite pinpoint where this one fails but it definitely does. Segal isn't a very good actor anyway and the rest of the cast is in the same league. Gary Busey, who has done some good work, didn't put much effort into this one either. All around, disappointing.",Under Siege
83,Darkside-Reviewer,Co star's Gary Busey in Drag,6,28 October 2020,"Under Siege is probably the only decent and memorable (Steven Seagal) movie although he did many movies after this was released it was his performance in Under Siege that helped him get many of his roles in future movies. Seagal never really reached the same level of fame as other more notable action movie stars like (Jean-Claude Van Damme), (Arnold Schwarzenegger), (Bruce Willis) and of course (Sylvester Stallone). This was mainly due to the fact that Seagal has always been a difficult person to work with due to him being a bit of an on set diva aswell as his very arrogant personality both on and off the camera. On the set of Under Seige he had frequent arguments with Co Star (Tommy Lee Jones) because Jones had nicknamed him Seagull as a joke which Seagal took as insult. Seagal also designed the costume for his character himself as he didn't like the designs put together by actual professionals just one of several instances of Seagal acting like an on set diva. Seagal has gone on to star in many action films over the years although most of them end up being straight to video releases most of which are just over the top action B movies and not the so bad their good kind.Under Siege is a fairly decent action movie that manages to stay entertaining and enjoyable throughout with it's enjoyably funny characters aswell having some entertaining action scenes that include a fair amount of blood and violence that involve several explosions, guns, hand to hand fighting, impalements aswell as a pretty cool knife fight scene. The story itself isn't anything we haven't already seen before in other action movies but it still manages to entertain. A group of terrorists lead by (Tommy Lee Jones) character sneak aboard a battle ship taking control by force while they attempt to steal some nuclear weapons with plans to sell them to waring countries in an attempt to cause a revolution war. Seagal plays an chef who is also an ex navy seal and when the ship gets taken over he decides to fight back against the terrorists and break the siege on the ship.The best characters in this movie are definitely (Tommy Lee Jones) who plays the lead terrorist and main antagonist Stranix a professional hijacker who dresses like a 1970s rock star Jones plays this role similar to the way he played Two Face a role he played years later in Batman Forever (1995) he plays his character in a way only he can with a lot of energetic movement while spouting out snappy one liners. Jones' performance works well when sharing the screen with fellow Co Star (Gary Busey) who plays Krill a navel commander turned terrorist who helps Stranix and his crew take control of the ship Busey's performance is very similar to Jones' they both play off of each others reactions well both playing the comedy relief characters who are just insane and fun to watch. In my personal opinion Seagal's performance isn't anything all that special in this movie really it's the supporting cast that make Under Siege so memorable.I recommend watching Under Siege if your a fan of classic 80s and 90s action movies it's fun to watch with plenty of action and violence to keep you entertained.",Under Siege
84,Min111,Steven Seagal best movie,8,1 October 2014,"This is Die Hard on a ship, but this time the hero is Casey Ryback. This movie is probably Steven Seagal's best, and is filled with excitement and plenty of action. The story takes place on a battleship where the ""cook"" Casey Ryback (Steven Seagal) prepares meals for everyone on board, but this time he has to prepare an even bigger meal because there will a ""surprise"" party for the captain. The movie was extremely good and successful, and one of the best Die Hard clones out there. Certainly, one of my favourite action movies there is. It is probably pretty boring at the beginning, but it does get better and better as you watch the movie, and that's perfectly fine for someone that's into action movies. I like the fact that almost all of the action takes place on a ship, and this makes it all the more interesting compared to other action movies. I like how all of the bad guys can't seem to find Ryback on a battleship, and struggles against him everytime. Surely, it's easier to find and catch someone on a ship compared to a tall building (like in Die Hard). Strangely, for some reason, Under Siege is underrated. I would say it's almost just as good as Die Hard. I think it's probably the best Die Hard clone, and that's why I think it's pretty underrated. Steven Seagal may not be as popular compared to the likes of Van Damme, Arnold Schwarzenegger or Bruce Willis, but he has been part of some successful action movies, and Under Siege is certainly one of them.
 
Other notable casts in this movie are Tommy Lee Jones, who starred in the Fugitive, and Gary Busey, who starred in Lethal Weapon, so it's a movie certainly worth watching considering the cast involved.",Under Siege
85,caa821,Steven still cannot be contained,6,16 April 2008,"On a couple of occasions in the ""Austin Powers"" flicks, Dr. Evil's resentful, critical son, chides him as to why he doesn't simply whack Powers right now, instead of going through some elaborate machinations (such as suspending him above a shark tank) from which he'll inevitably escape before his delayed death can occur.This is, of course, a take-off on the many times James Bond's nemeses off everybody in sight except him, and where even if he had only, say, a packet of dental floss, he'd use it to escape in the nick of time.Here the delightfully awful bad guys, Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Busey, chewing every possible piece of scenery in their path, shoot point-blank many key personnel, including the vessel's captain, but for some reason wish solely to confine Steven in or around the meat locker in the galley, with only a somewhat nerdy enlisted man on-guard. The story holds no doubt, whatever, as to what will subsequently ensue. Like all of Steven's flicks, it's like an interesting piece of performance art with kicking, chopping, shooting in massive quantity until all is well - or some semblance of same is reached - at the conclusion.The real suspense in one of his movies is watching to see if at some point, someday, he might actually crack a true smile, or at least a wide grin. And the repartee between Tommy Lee Jones and his former, top-level friends, with him on-board the battleship and them around a huge table at the Pentagon, is another a wonderful piece of performance art within the main plot. Likewise the clueless beauty queen, who has apparently been asleep in the cake, originally planned for the late captain, and her conversations with Steven when she finally awakens.",Under Siege
86,Aylmer,The End of an Era,7,1 May 2015,"Seagal's first four films undoubtedly constitute his best work as far as his fans are concerned. This DIE HARD clone set on a Battleship wins mass appeal based on its premise alone and cements its stature as ""Best Seagal Movie"" with very strongly directed and acted scenes involving the villains. There's a wonderful little cat 'n mouse feel to the film and even manages to stay interesting during the scenes in between the action with Seagal stalking the ship's lonely corridors and various rooms, encountering various obstacles along the way.However, there were a few worrying trends beginning to surface when this film was made. Most obviously was Seagal's weight, which was starting to become a bit of a distraction by this film and even more-so with each concurrent film following this (aside from his commendable attempt to trim down for EXIT WOUNDS). This would be the first film of many to feature his image on the cover heavily digitally doctored to reduce his double-chin.Additionally this is the first Seagal movie to introduce him working with a team of lackies responsible for doing a lot of his dirty work, presumably as a way to make his one-man-army routine have some semblance of realism. Okay, well MARKED FOR DEATH had some of this too, but they were at least interesting characters. Unfortunately though, they also serve to steal attention and screen time away from our hero, villains, and quality kills to the point where (as in all his modern films) Seagal is barely even in the thing.Now, Seagal never was the most approachable or friendly-looking guy but this film is the first time the villains are much more charming and compelling than he is. Given that Jones and Busey are charismatic actors, their characters are actually interesting and off-kilter while Seagal is just an even more one-dimensional version of himself, with all kinds of the shoehorned-in CIA and Special Forces ego-trip background motifs that have been with him since is first film. The entire movie I was rooting for them to just shoot him and felt a little sad with each terrorist fatality. It introduces the bumbling and annoying sidekick, epitomized by Ms. Eleniak who is utterly useless in this film aside from as comic relief and the all-too-brief birthday cake scene. Seagal unforgivably makes her change in the very next scene, adding to the unlike-ability of his character.UNDER SIEGE is a fun film, possibly the most fun of all DIE HARD's clones. It's got its share of disappointments though and plenty of brilliant villains whose IQ decreases by 100 points whenever they get a chance to kill the hero. At one point, one of them even dies twice if you watch closely, possibly another nod to a Seagal earlier work regarding a villain in MARKED FOR DEATH. We have the success of UNDER SIEGE to thank for the existence of Seagal's insane tour de force in the legendarily awful ON DEADLY GROUND, which was financed to secure his appearance in this film's inevitable sequel.",Under Siege
87,action-6,Excellent!!,10,19 December 1999,"Under Siege was Steven Seagal`s first blockbuster, which made a lot of money. Steven Seagal plays Casey Ryback, a cook on board the USS Missouri.  Ryback is not only a cook though, he is an ex-SEAL, which is good for him when terrorists take over the ship. The terrorists are lead by Tommy Lee Jones, who is excellent as a crazy terrorist leader.  Steven Seagal is one of my favorite actors, and this is a very good example of what he can do.  Acting is not Seagal`s strongest side, but who cares when he is excellent as an actionstar.  Steven Seagal starts killing terrorists by himself (and is joined by a female stripper?!) Andrew Davies is back as a director(he also directed Seagal`s Above The Law). The movie is very good, but still I prefer the sequel, which is even better!!!!!  Top marks for Seagal as a flawless actionhero! 10/10",Under Siege
88,Cinemaniac1984,Steven Seagal's best movie at the peak of his career.,8,8 February 2015,"Steven Seagal has never been better in Under Siege, his most successful movie to date. After establishing his reputation in Hollywood with Above the Law (1988), Hard to Kill (1990), Marked for Death (1990), and Out for Justice (1991), Steven Seagal's career kicks into another gear with one of the most successful movies of 1992, which also proves to be his best movie at the peak of his career. Also with a good director and good screenwriter, Under Siege brought out the best in Steven Seagal.Steven Seagal (who has also cut off his trademark ponytail for this movie) is a former Navy Seal turned cook Casey Ryback. The movie starts with Ryback continuing to show defiance to most of the chain of command aboard USS Missouri, including Commander Krill (Gary Busey at his villainous best) who is also organising a party on board USS Missouri and has arranged to bring in entertainers via helicopter who are really mercenaries led by the unhinged and unstable William Strannix (Tommy Lee Jones at his over the top best). The main plan is for William Strannix and turncoat Commander Krill to hijack USS Missouri and take all sailors on board hostage in order to steal and sell the tomahawk missiles. The plan almost goes well until Casey Ryback, who was imprisoned in the freezer for assaulting Commander Krill, proves to be the hostages only hope as Ryback manages to escape and takes on the mercenaries himself. Along the way, playboy playmate Jordan Tate (Erika Eleniak who is the only actress in this movie) who was brought onto the ship for entertainment value, is roped into helping Casey Ryback along with a small handful of freed sailors.Under Siege is summed up perfectly as Die Hard on a battleship, and it proves to be a very entertaining action feast. There is no shortage of gunfights, martial arts fights, knife fights, stylized deaths, explosions, and cracking one liners that will keep all action fans very content.Steven Seagal has never been better in his prime as Casey Ryback, the former Navy Seal turned cook. He's very likable in this movie and its a shame that this one time box office champion has been reduced to keeping his career alive through non-stop direct-to-video movies in which Seagal is a shadow of his former self. Under Siege will always be remembered as Steven Seagal's best movie to date. Tommy Lee Jones is a quality actor who often appears frequently as serious no-nonsense characters such as The Fugitive and the Men In Black trilogy. Here in Under Siege he is excellently over the top and the wild and unhinged William Strannix.Gary Busey frequently plays bizarre and psychotic characters, and is often one of the go-to actors if they need a crazy villain as evidenced in Lethal Weapon (1987) as the henchman Mr Joshua. As Commander Krill in Under Siege, he shows that he is psychologically unstable, particularly when he appears in drag during the USS Missouri's party. He also makes a great bad guy partnership with Tommy Lee Jones.Erika Eleniak as playboy playmate Jordan Tate who has been caught up in the hijacking show off her assets for one brief scene and then cries, whines and huffs and puffs her way through the movie at first but later sheds her damsel in distress image to help Ryback take down the mercenaries. If I had one criticism of Under Siege is that her character was unnecessary for this movie and the movie could have done without her.Director Andrew Davis reunites with Steven Seagal from his 1988 debut movie Above the Law and he does a great job as a director. Following the success of Under Siege, Andrew Davis would be picked to direct the Harrison Ford/Tommy Lee Jones blockbuster thriller The Fugitive (1993).There have been so many movies that have attempted to replicate the success of Die Hard (1988) and there have been a variety of mixed results. Under Siege is definitely one of those movies that is a successful blueprint of Die Hard, but also carves out its own success without falling into the trap of being another Die Hard wannabe. Under Siege is a great action movie in its own right, and definitely one of Steven Seagal's best movies that will never be beaten.Watch Under Siege and enjoy yourself.8/10.",Under Siege

90,supertom-3,Steven Seagal's best!!,9,22 June 2002,"This is by far Seagals best film and his only one that you could truly call good. His others range from average to just plain awful, but this is a great action film. Its basically Dies Hard on a boat, but is one of the few successful Die Hard clones. Andrew Davis made this before The Fugitive, and his direction is tense and exciting, whats more he gets Seagals best performance which basically means he is slightly less wooden than usual.The plot revolves around this Battleship which is being taken out of use. On its final run, coinciding with the captains birthday, the ship gets hi-jacked by terrorists who plan to use the nuclear weapons on board. Seagal a former Navy Seal, with more medals than a medal shop, is on board as the ships cook, as this is the only position he can occupy in the ship after he was involved in a military blunder previously. Seagal uses his skills to cause problems for the terrorists as he sets out to stop them, aided by Miss July 89 Jordan The played by the sexy and melon chested Erika Eleniak who is certainly there for her looks ahead of acting ability, she is however a cut above Seagal in the acting department.The action in this is great, Seagals usual Aikido master class is on display as well as some good gun fights, and impressive stunts. Seagal has always had a bit of paunch but he looks a lot fitter than his recent films where he lumbers about, in his earlier films he actually seems in some sort of shape and actually looks tough.Overall this is an entertaining film, Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Busey are in scene stealing form as the bad guys and Seagal is at the top of his game. 8/10",Under Siege

With the ship's crew held hostage Ryback has only one ally Jordan Tate (Erika Eleniak) a stripper hired for the Captains party to help him stop the terrorists and rescue the hostages.Steven Seagal performances have never been overly impressive but the low key approach here works for the character and the film, likely better than in any of his other films. Both Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Busey the principal villains, arguably considerably more talented actors go much more over the top which again works for the film although it won't likely be cited as being amongst their best work. Not to be outdone we also have a supporting turn from Colm Meaney who apparently takes his cue from Jones and Busey The humor and action mix from director Andrew Davis who would go onto to make ""The Fugitive"" the following year is perhaps the biggest reason for the films success. Both Seagal and Eleniak neither of which is well known for their comedic talents, never the less deliver some very funny lines. The effective action scenes and the setting upon a ship at sea also serve to make this an enjoyable film, as long as you aren't looking for nuanced performances or a depth of story.The films sequel ""Under Siege 2: Dark Territory"" without director Davis or any of the principles except for Seagal was far less successful and much inferior.

92,mhasheider,A sharply-crafted and well-executed thriller.,8,1 April 2002,"A sharply-crafted and well-executed thriller that's about Casey Ryback (Steven Seagal), a former Navy SEAL, who's spending his last days in the Navy as a cook on the Missouri when a small, absolutely lethal band of terrorists unexpectedly overtake the ship, the crew, and murder the skipper.The thugs are led by Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Busey, both of whom colorfully portray Strannix, a disgruntled (and laugh out-loud) CIA operative and Krill, an embittered high-ranking officer who isn't too fond of Ryback.  What the terrorists are after is the ship's nuclear arsenal and plan to sell (and unload) it anyone for a hefty price.  In the scenes that they have, Busey and Jones share some funny moments like for instance, Strannix tells Krill that his code name is the ""Roadrunner"".  I guess that some people haven't lost their affection for cartoons, old or new.As for Ryback, who is forced to retake the ship and he does find someone to back him up.  Jordan Tate (Erika Elenik), who is at first reluctant to help Casey, but she decides later on to do so.  You could say that Jordan becomes Casey's apt pupil in learning the guerilla tactics and doesn't turn into a stereotype.Some of the shootouts, fights and traps are well-organized even though some scenes do get a bit ugly and I won't say which ones.  Director Andrew Davis (""The Fugitive"") and writer J.F. Lawton deserve a lot of credit for keeping ""Under Siege"" creative, smart, and witty instead of letting the film become another ""Die Hard"" retread.  Gary Chang composes a nice musical score here, that's fun to listen to and it never gets too loud.""Under Siege"" is my favorite Seagal movie although Jones and Busey sort of steal the show here.

In fact, the last one was about 'Hard to Kill', and at one point I mentioned that I should check out 'Under Siege' again. Lo and behold, what was on TV later that day but 'Under Siege', in all its glory. 'Under Siege' was one of my favourite movies when I was a kid, now I think its Seagal's best movie, and still one of the best action movies around.Seagal plays Casey Ryback, a navy cook serving on-board the USS Missouri. He is liked by the captain, but prone to striking other officers. Only the Captain knows that Ryback is an ex-seal, and when the Missouri is taken over by terrorists, only Ryback can stop the bad-guys and save the crew.'Under Siege' is, at it's core, a 'Die Hard' clone on a ship. Its not as good as 'Die Hard', but its still a classic action movie. Ryback is a great action hero: cool, collected, funny, and kicks plenty of butt. Tommy Lee Jones plays an awesome villain as William Stranix, an ex-CIA agent and now terrorist. Stranix is easily one of my favourite movie villain. Apart from Ryback and Stranix, there is almost no character development. The rest of the characters are just there, and some may have completely personality changes at random. Hey, its an action flick.The action scenes are exciting. There may be as many fighting scenes as there are in other Seagal movie, but Seagal is always keeping the action going, whether it by rescuing people, shooting people, sneaking around, or blowing things up.

He's so good at being so crazy and so bad that he's borderline likable as a character. Gary Busey, too, mirroring TLJ's insanity but with more humor. Seagal is more or less wooden as ever, but there's a certain wit to his character here that makes him lovable. Then there's the action!

The good thing about Seagal is that he has so much variation in how he tackles the bad guys. Knives, microwave-ovens, guns, chains, he uses almost everything in his own special way to handle the scumbags. Other actors does a pretty good job too. Tommy Lee-Jones delivers as a crazy villain, and Gary Busey fits perfectly to play assholes like Commander Krill. And the knife-fight at the end between Seagal and Jones is just brilliant.All in all: One of the best action movies ever made.",Under Siege
99,nims-1975,Awesome Steven Seagal film with great action,8,13 June 2020,"Under Siege is a very good film with some awesome fight scenes and awesome action. Under Siege is about an ex Navy Seal turned cook called Casey Ryback who has a lot of serious and important things when a US Battleship is taken control by a group of malicious Terrorists lead by the malicious and big egoed Commander Krill(played by Gary Busey). Krill also gets the help from a malicious rogue CIA operative William Strannix(played by Tommy Lee Jones) who also is out to hijack the ships nuclear arsenal. To stop these malicious Terrorists who have committed serious crimes and are enjoying seeing the hostages suffer that they have hold of. Casey Ryack is the only one who can save the people and kill the terrorists. This film does have some great fight scenes, action explosions etc. What stopped this film from being an in between very good and excellent or excellent film was that it wasn't intense, it was more a Martial Arts Comedy with Gary Busey and Tommy Lee Jones, the fight scenes needed to be better, the villains were not realistic and convincing, Gary Buseys acting as Krill was stupid and awful, Tommy Lee Jones was a useless villain and I was convinced by his or Gary Buseys portrayal of villains.",Under Siege
100,Gunn,Action Packed and Movin' Fast!,9,4 February 2009,"Another Andrew Davis actioner that proves he's one of the best with Action films. Here we meet one of the great film characters in Casey Ryback (Steven Seagal). The film has some nasty villains too in Tommy Lee Jones, Gary Busey and Colm Meaney. The story of the hijacking of a super nuclear battleship by extremely clever criminals moves fast as is director Davis' style. He keeps things moving with ex-Navy Seal, Ryback who's not one to mess with! Great cinematography of the ship plowing its course, a nifty music score and above all, non-stop action. There will be no acting Oscars here, but the stunt people sure deserve some kind of award. When will they have their day? This film made me a Seagal fan and some of his films are damn good!

Tomy Lee Jones hams it up worse than a cartoon villain, it's almost painful to watch. Busey is eclipsed by Jones, which is a good thing 'cause Busey himself is nothing more than a stupid little caricature. Seagal's character lacks the fury and the threat which he had in his earlier roles. The action takes too long to get started. When it does, it's not enough. When it does become enough, it's too damn late.If you want to see Seagal at his best, watch ""Marked for Death"" or the excellent ""Out for Justice."" ""Under Siege"" is not his worst but he was already past his heyday, sad to say.The people claiming this to be Seagal at the top of his game are too dumb to know any better.

I do enjoy the genre as long as it's not too stupid. Under Siege does actually work, even though Seagal has limited acting abilities. Tommy Lee Jones brings oodles of charisma to the screen as the baddie, ably assisted by the treachous naval officer, Busey. Seagals only real contribution is to say, quite well, ""i'm just a cook'.A disgruntled CIA operative (jones) who specialises in taking over ships/subs, decides to take over the last U.S. battle ship, why ? to sell the tomahawk missiles of course, presumably at the nearest boot fair. Conveniently Busey (as first officer) is able to assist in taking over the ship. Their evil plan is to load a helicopter full of baddies pretending to be caterers, arriving on the Missouri for the captains 'surprise' party. They take over the ship and seagal, assisted by a lady with remarkably fine personalities, has to prevent them succeeding in their evil plan. Seagal is so wooden he could be made of oak, fortunately good actors do add life to the story. It's a good action romp, obviously not to be taken tooooooo seriously, but it's fun.

It took place on a train instead of a navel warship!",Under Siege
104,TheRadiobox,Die Hard on a battleship,5,21 September 2021,"Under Siege was directed by Andrew Davis, written by J. F. Lawton and stars Steven Seagal, Tommy Lee Jones, Gary Busey, Erika Eleniak, Colm Meaney, and Patrick O'Neal. It follows a Navy cook and a model as they fight to take back control of a battleship from a group of mutinying military men.The Plot: In the early 90's, right after Die Hard reshaped the action genre not once but twice, other studios went off to the races to make their own blockbusters that fit the basic template. Under Siege, despite being possibly the first financial success utilizing the formula, doesn't have a plot anywhere near as interesting, well-crafted, or seamless as its influencers. Onboard the USS Missouri, it's Captain Adams' (O'Neal) birthday, and his second-in-command, Krill (Busey), intends to throw him a party to celebrate. The ship's culinary specialist, Ryback (Seagal) shares the sentiment but gets into trouble with Krill, resulting in him being locked in a freezer while ex-CIA operatives Strannix (Jones), Daumer (Meaney), and a legion of goons board the ship posing as rockstars, with ""Bunny of the Month"" Jordan (Eleniak) in tow. Just how Strannix was able to get onboard without being found out in one way or another is unknown and nonsensically glossed over. The crazed men kill Adams and take over the ship, but somehow Krill (a commander) doesn't know Ryback's history, allowing the man to escape and team up with Jordan to take it back before the baddies sell the ship's rockets to the North Koreans. Shaving down the details is fine if it begets a brisker movie, however, many of the motives are unrevealed, the bad guys made purposely unaware of the ship they've chosen to take over, and Jordan is no Powell.The Characters: Since Davis cast Seagal in a leading role that isn't Nico Toscani, one of the most vital elements of the Die Hard formula can be crossed off the list even before watching the movie. Ryback seems to be a ""lowly, lowly cook"", which would've made the takeback much more exciting, but of course, he's an ex-SEAL; effectively guaranteeing his unscathed victory. Unlike McClane, Ryback is a blank slate aside from his past exploits in Vietnam, Panama, and the Middle East. No mention is given to his family life, he isn't given (by Seagal or the script) a personality and is less inventive than McClane; though this is by design since Davis acknowledged that Seagal couldn't (and still can't) act and that the villains are far more interesting than the hero. Strannix and Krill are easily the best parts of the movie as the both of them are unhinged and vengeful towards the U. S. government for trying to assassinate them. Why? Good question. It's their sheer insanity that makes them fun to watch and far less predictable than other villains in movies with the same scenario. Jordan isn't much better than Ryback. Eleniak is beautiful and has the acting talent to match her other pair of ""talents"", but Jordan just whines for the whole movie, only in the final act becoming useful for any reason aside from eye candy. Although Davis leans more towards the villains, they're still frustrating in their convoluted and spotty decision making, and the hero is as bland as the man who portrays him.The Action: After bursting onto the action scene with Above the Law, Code of Silence, and The Package, it comes as no surprise that the action in Under Siege is never less than competent. The initial takeover is excellently paced and the eventual reveal of Strannix and Krill is violent without venturing into overkill territory. What's different about Under Siege when compared to Seagal's previous starrers is the focus on gunplay rather than martial arts. It's far less dynamic than Above the Law, Marked for Death, and Out for Justice; and the filming of these gunfights is mostly average thanks to dark lighting which hides some of the things going on. Obviously the action was coordinated and planned well, but the movie shoots itself in the foot by bathing the scenery in shadow. Some scenes rely more on stunt work, such as one bit where Ryback has to jump off the Missouri to escape the enemy and climb on via the rope of an anchor. Ryback and Strannix do get to fight each other, and surprisingly it lasts for more than ten seconds; allowing Strannix to almost get a hit in on Ryback. Unfortunately the filming of that fight looks less like a choreographed battle and more like Seagal swinging his knife around with a few insert shots of Strannix taking hits. Despite being renowned as Seagal's best outing, the action is disappointingly average when compared to Davis's other works and Seagal's high marks mentioned above.The Technics: Under Siege effectively manages its scale, careful not to overwhelm the audience with too many locations on the expansive setting. Of major note here is the sound design and foley work. Everything sounds bombastic, visceral, and impactful, with the ending fight and all the gunfire most deserving of praise. Andrew Davis's direction is also solid. It's clear that he tried to veer away from the flaws in the script and entertain the viewer with the most talented people involved in the movie instead of focusing on the wooden board playing hero. This hardly fixes the problems riddling the movie but it does alleviate them to a degree. Casting Seagal is perhaps the biggest woe the movie faces, denying the movie a character to root for. Under Siege certainly spent its effects, set, and sound budget well, but the writing and mediocre action direction does it in.This is hardly Seagal's best outing, though among his watchable ones. Lawton didn't manage the template it aspired to use correctly, resulting in average action, a plot with wide holes, and a subpar-at-best hero. Jones, Busey, Eleniak and Davis keep this boat afloat, not the rest of the crew.59/100.",Under Siege
105,Chromium_5,Mediocre action film suffers from lack of action,6,16 January 2005,"Oh, it has its moments, but overall this movie was--I hate to say it--dull. It is clearly reaching for the cinematic nirvana that is ""Die Hard,"" but unfortunately it falls short. Seagal spends most of his time sneaking around in the shadows and mumbling, and very little time actually fighting. The action scenes are awesome, of course--they include an interesting death wherein a guy gets an I-beam dropped on his head, and a truly kickass knife fight--but they are few and far between. Even Tommy Lee Jones as the villain couldn't save it. It's an admirable effort to put the ""Die Hard"" formula on a ship, but in the end, it is mediocre.6/10 stars.",Under Siege

While the film is technically ""Die Hard"" on a battle ship, it is well directed enough and there is enough action to make it stand on it's own. Seagal is not a great performer but he makes this movie adequete. My major complaint about this movie is a lack of fighting scenes, some people complained that""Exit Wounds"" was devoid of the same thing, maybe. But this film was made 9 years ago,and Seagal was 41 when this was made, he's 50 now.  Seagal could have done more fighting. But overall I really enjoyed this film, there are numerous exciting action scenes, and some really funny comical moments. his film stands on it's own as good entertainment and as a first rate action film starring today's biggest martial arts star, Steven Seagal.",Under Siege
107,DeuceWild_77,"So-so action film in the vein of ""Die Hard"" without almost everything that made the latter the pinnacle of action excellence !!",6,30 March 2018,"""Under Siege"" was the first big Seagal movie in terms of production values and higher budget after the 'four in a row' successes of ""Nico - Above the Law"" ('88); ""Hard to Kill"" & ""Marked for Death"" (both from '90) and ""Out for Justice"" ('91), reteaming the now established action star with the director Andrew Davis (""Code of Silence""; ""Nico""; ""The Package"") in a screenplay penned by J. F. Lawton (""Pretty Woman"" and the future writer / director of ""The Hunted"" starring Christopher Lambert) and produced by Seagal himself for Warner Bros., the Studio that was responsible for his screen debut 4 years before.It's noticeable that this movie was made based on the previous box office hit and critical praise of the first two ""Die Hard"" films with Seagal throwed in it, who was willing to enter mainstream to be equated to the likes of Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger or Bruce Willis, as a legit action star.The good thing is that Andrew Davis is a competent director in the action genre, the budget was there and the movie looks good either in the technical level and the artistic one, with nice wide shots of the U.S. Navy battleship USS Missouri in the open sea, the bad thing is, besides that, the movie lacks the thrilling factor, the suspense, the momentaneum and even the action / fight sequences are passable or staged a bit dull. 
There's no memorable fights like Seagal's first four films and the way he won the day against the terrorists it's far too easy and far fetched even for action movies standards (if we compare it with ""Die Hard""...).The cast is probably the best in a Seagal film, with the two main villains played by Tommy Lee Jones, in a flamboyant performance that looks like the actor was having lots of fun performing it, and the forever baddie, Gary Busey, in ""Lethal Weapon""'s Mr. Joshua mode, both upstaging the lead action star, plus a supporting cast of well known character actors such as the veteran Patrick O' Neal (""Alvarez Kelly""); Damian Chapa (""Street Fighter""), Raymond Cruz (""Training Day""), Bernie Casey (""Never Say Never Again""), Troy Evans (""Kuffs""), Nick Mancuso (""Rapid Fire""), George Cheung (""Rambo - First Blood - Part II""), Andy Romano, Colm Meaney (""Con Air""), Michael Des Barres (Murdoc from ""MacGyver"") and even Kane ""Jason Voorhees"" Hodder among lots of others.""Baywatch"" former star and Playboy Playmate, Erika Eleniak, was cast as the stripper blonde bimbo going gung ho to please Seagal's vanity desire of scoring with a beautiful young woman half his age, but their on-screen chemistry is less than zero and her character, besides being an eye candy for the viewer, is entirely pointless.""Under Siege"" was Oscar nominated for Sound and Sound Effects and that marked the zenith of Seagal's career and Seagal-a-side, its success was responsible for Andrew Davis helm the vastly superior ""The Fugitive"" 1 year later, which was nominated for several Oscars (including Best Picture) and earned Tommy Lee Jones the award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role.In short, as a 'warm-up' to ""The Fugitive"", ""Under Siege"" earned his place in the history of action films, but being Seagal's biggest film, doesn't translate for Seagal's best film, it was just a failed attempt to promote him to mainstream, because besides its box office success, 2 years later the pony-tail'd action star was helping Eskimos against the evil Oil Tycoon, Michael Caine, in the God awful ""On Deadly Ground""...I give it 5 stars and 1 extra for the production values and Davis' assertive (but unfortunately not that creative) direction.",Under Siege

109,rawiri42,I suppose it just HAD to have the girl!,5,29 October 2014,"I guess the most memorable part of ""Under Siege"" was wondering whether such a thing could ever actually happen. No, not the SEAL- turned- cook part - the hijacking of a battleship. Like, could a terrorist group of about 30 men really take over a warship on the high seas?Well, the way this movie presented it, it would seem that they could! Bearing in mind that this movie was made long before the events of 9/11 and, had it been made about what happened then, I can imagine that a lot of reviewers would be writing things like, ""Man!! THAT could never happen!"" and we all now know the answer to that one don't we?So let's assume that it could be possible for a group of lunatic terrorists to take over a battleship and then offload all its strategic weaponry onto an enemy submarine. At least we now have a believable plot which then leaves us with Steven Seagal. Next question: Could a highly-trained Navy SEAL be busted to cook for insubordination? Obviously that would seem so too. Since I don't want to include any spoilers here that aren't already in the IMDb summary, suffice to say that Rybeck (Seagal) is (or was) a very efficient SEAL in his day because he very effectively deals with the gang of hijackers culminating with, firstly, the traitorous third officer Krill (not very well played by Gary Busey) and then the lead hijacker (very well played by Tommy Lee Jones).The reason for having ex-Playboy bunny Erika Eleniac on board as a ""surprise"" for the captain's birthday party was just sufficient to have her (and her ample bosom) in the movie although her extremely rapid change from bimbo to hard-nosed killer was a bit hard to take.

It's so entertaining you don't care.There's not much more to say about Under Siege because there's not much else to it.

112,boondocksaint20,Decent Action Flick,7,9 April 2007,"I saw this one way back when it came out, and thought it was pretty good 15 years ago. The action is quick and fierce, the plot is interesting and the bad guys are all psychotic and evil (kudos go to Busey and Jones).However, where this film falls flat is the lack of suspense. Many people call this 'Die Hard on a boat', well, it is in a lot of respects. However, the most important thing that separates those two films is suspense. Bruce Willis showed us a vulnerable guy put in a extraordinary situation against a group of terrorists. Honestly, the first time I saw Die Hard, I was probably about 8 years old, and having never seen a movie like this (had there even been one before it?) I honestly didn't know if McClane would survive the ordeal. In other words, I was on the edge of my seat the entire movie. With Under Siege, we have an awesome setup, however, Seagal NEVER breaks a sweat, and comes out of the ordeal practically unscathed. That is why I prefer Die Hard to this one, is the human vulnerability showed by Bruce Willis. Seagal rarely, if ever, shows any type of human flaws...preferring to be his stereotypical quiet badass character that we've seen eleventy billion times.Having said that, Under Siege is still a good time waster. Good action, with great badguys, and let's not forget to mention that former Baywatch babe's perfect jugs popping out of a birthday cake, and you have a pretty damn good action flick. Still, this is not a suspenseful film in any regard...Die Hard this is not. I give her 7 out of 10 stars.",Under Siege

In fact this may be his best film! Ryback is the John McLane type character as the only one who can prevent terrorists taking over the USS Missouri and stealing the nuclear warheads. Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Busey head up the terrorists and Erika Eleniak plays Jordan Tate, former Miss July 1979 or thereabouts. She looks good and can act. She and Seagal link together to cause mayhem on board.There's an attempt at humour, even an attempt at acting by our hero. The filming is good and the plot makes sense, well as much sense as the Die Hard series. The pacing is very good. Tommy Lee tries to steal every scene and the overall result is quite pleasing.

The original Die Hard transcended the action genre, one man or in this case, one cook – ""just a lowly, lowly cook"" against a group of highly trained bad guys.Under Siege pays homage to Die Hard but it's by no means a poor or vain attempt to recreate what made Die Hard so successful. It's a complete story with a superb cast of exciting and colorful characters, led by the maniacal William Strannix (Tommy Lee Jones) and Commander Krill (Gary Busey). Our hero is a soft spoken 'cook' Casey Ryback, played by Steven Seagal in his most memorable and capable performance.Complete with great thrills and even greater kills – Under Siege is a highly enjoyable and underrated movie which deserves its place among the top actioners of the nineties.Remember, it's not a job, it's an adventure.",Under Siege

When the gun-play erupts, not one of the many bad guys swarming around the deck and innards of the ship walks through the door at the right time to shoot Seagal in the back -- they only appear after Seagal has wasted somebody uninterrupted so he can turn around just in time for the next pigeon to enter the room and blow him away as well (just like Rambo and all those other cardboard action movie characters).For all its ineptitude, this movie remains a solid action flick. Actually, one of Seagal's best films (my personal favorite Seagal film, for what that's worth.... I'm not a die-hard Seagal fan).Don't forget to see Steve in 'On Deadly Ground' where he plays a peaceful ecology activist who has the audacity (and hypocrisy) to punch the crap out of a guy in a bar to the point where the guy is ready to drop dead, as well as Seagal, 'our hero', wearing animal skins and littering the Alaskan tundra with his cigarette butts.",Under Siege

No wonder Die Hard 3 was re-planned after this, 'cause there was nothing to better anymore. The movie has a nice pace and it moves along smoothly. Even the wooden Seagal isn't that much of a torture to watch. But the real fun lies in the performances of Jones and Busey. They make their characters to be those bad guys you love to hate. Also director Andrew Davis is wide awake this time. If you watch this and straight after Collateral Damage, the gap between the two is astounding. Collateral is flat in key scenes and the movie has no feeling. Siege is a raw no-compromising action thriller. It doesn't kiss ass.

When I watch a Steven Seagal movie, I hope to see him use Aikido (or broken pool cues, at least) to dispatch bad guys. And the knife fight at the end was pretty bad. Tommy Lee Jones is a good actor but I still can't believe that he'd last more than five seconds against Seagal in a knife fight. But this movie was still pretty fun.

But those things don't stop this from being a great movie.  Maybe I'm not objective though, because I do think that Seagal is one of the greatest action movie stars in history,  but it's still an awesome movie.  Seagal is Casey Ryback, an ex-navy seal turned cook on a battle ship.  When terrorists sneak aboard the ship during the captain's birthday party and take it over, only Ryback avoids capture.  Led by the traitorious first officer (Gary Busey) and an insane mercenary (Tommy Lee Jones), the terrorist try to steal the ships nuclear weapons.  But Ryback strikes back using awesome martial arts skills and armed with enough weapons to choke a horse.  The action scenes are incredible, and the martial arts scenes are great, reconfirming my belief that Seagal is the best martial arts movie star ever.  I recommend Under Siege to anyone looking for a good action movie.",Under Siege
122,RoboSlater,Erika Eleniak jumps out of a cake!,8,6 January 2003,"The most memorable moment in this action film is Erika Eleniak's topless debut as she jumps out of a cake in a most untimely moment ...  What a beauty!  Great juxtaposition of nudity with violence.  There's the usual smart-aleck and unfunny remarks of Seagal, who can afford better writers but doesn't use them.  The martial arts are wonderful.  I just wish Seagal wasn't such a one-dimensional actor.  But then, his audience doesn't require anything more of him.Eleniak is a better actress than she shows here, but she does ""helpless, buxom sidekick"" as well as you can expect from these writers.  Hollywood -- or somebody -- should be offering juicier dramatic parts to Eleniak.  Until then, she'll just be a popular poster girl in prison cells and juvenile bedrooms.",Under Siege

This is also Seagal's best film by far. If you like action, Seagal delivers, however in Under Siege, Seagal probably gives the best performance of his career. Seagal is not the only actor to make this film great. There are also the roles of William Stranix and Commander Krill played by Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Busey. Both of these actors play the villain roles excellent, especially Tommy Lee Jones. The acting by Jones, allows the insanity of William Stranix to come to life on the screen. Aside from the acting, the effects and stunts are excellent and for action movie lovers, you will not be disappointed. Under Siege is my favorite action film and favorite movie of all time. I give it a 10 out of 10.",Under Siege
124,pax03,"a thinking mans action movie, even if Seagal is in it",8,20 February 2006,"i remember watching this movie back when i was like 8 and i loved it, it was different than any other action movie at the time and now that i look back on it and know more about film and cinema i know why. the directing, the writing, the action, even the acting was good (Seagal) I remember reading the spine of the VHS that i had, it was referred to as Die Hard on a ship. that pretty much sums it up right there. You have the unwilling hero (seagal) put into a situation where he must go up against a host of terrorist that is led by the main villain (Jones) as they are trying to steal tomahawk missiles off a battleship and sell on the black market. Tommy Lee Jones shines as the maniacal villain and he pulls it off well. Gary Busey plays the 2nd list bad guy and he plays the role of the wormy, slimy villain very well. hes the villain that the audience want to see land in Seagals hands so he can be taught a lesson. Steven Seagal is the hero, yet again, but in this role he seems more ""mortal"" than in his previous movies where no one can hurt or do anything to him. He plays the role of the hero that is out numbered to a tee. Erica Ellaniack (sp?) is the damsel in distress and she is the partner of Seagal on his quest. there is some cheesy dialog along the way, but most is pretty solid and there is some ""kind of knew that was going to happen"" moments but most of all the movie is pretty solid. Just like what most people are saying, this is steven seagal's best movie but it is not just him, tommy lee jones, gary busey also give stand out performances and andrew davis' directing is great as well, lots of props to him as he notches another tab as being one of the most talented, overlooked directors out there. if you liked Die Hard and Seagals earlier stuff, you will enjoy this.

125,LawnBoy-4,"Corny, scenery-chewing performances kill this movie",3,23 May 2020,"We all know and accept the fact that Seagal is a truly terrible ""actor"", so a laughably bad performance by him is always expected. That said, his ""performance"" is far from the worst aspect of this laughably bad schlock-fest. Indeed, the honor for worst performance in ""Under Siege"" is shared by Tommy ""Scenery-Chewer"" Lee Jones and Andy Romano, each of whom delivers cornball, eye-rollingly bad lines in the most over-the-top, melodramatic fashion imaginable. Seriously, I actually became embarrassed while watching these over-actors put their ""talents"" on display.In addition being a king-size jerk, Tommy Lee Jones is an overrated, scenery-chewing hack whose career has been filled with performances featuring the same boiler plate ""character"" time and again. Jones is one of those actors who essentially plays himself in every role, exhibiting zero range or dynamic whatsoever. If you've seen one performance from him, you've seen them all. In this film, Jones's ridiculous, over-the-top Saturday Morning cartoons soliloquy and subsequent ""little piggy"" switch-flipping stand out above the rest as examples of just how awful he is.Romano has always functioned as a ""bit"" actor who injects so much contrived melodrama into his performances that it's advisable to keep the fast-forward button within reach. To wit:
""If I can't control you.....(pregnant pause)....I may as well support you. You, uh, have yourself some good luck out there"".
Ugh.Many other things to hate about this film, but I'll just end it by stating that the entire score (including all instruments) appears to have been composed in an old 80s Roland D-50.

An extremely entertaining movie, Under Siege follows ex-navy seal Casey Ryback as he combats an army of terrorists who have come aboard his battle ship to steal the nuclear arsenal.  Tommy Lee Jones is splendid as William Stranyx, the terrorists vicious leader. Under Siege is full of cool explosions and good stunts.

127,Thomas-Giffin,Seagal's Best,7,14 May 2012,"Well, this film is the height of Seagal's career. The best film he has ever done.....fact!Playing Casey Ryback, the ship's cook, Seagal brings a level of charm, charisma and action man can-do attitude to this film. Aided, of course by beautifully OTT villains, played by the unholy trinity of Tommy Lee Jones, Gary 'Insane in the membrane' Busey and Colm 'DS9' Meaney, they all chew the scenery until their mouths are full. Gary Busey especially excels as the charmless and dangerous Commander Krill (Busey in drag is a scene that highlights his frame of mind).The director, Andrew Davis (who also directed Nico) directs this film with flair and style and commands a not terrible cast to perform well with a run of the mill script. The story is a simple, terrorist highjacking narrative but it is elevated with a cheeky humour, nice little one liners and characters fleshed out a little bit more than you would have expected from a film of this type. Once again, the martial arts and gunfights are well done, there is a knife fight towards the end of the film which is just good and there is no shortage of explosions, creative deaths and gunfire to keep the crowd from noticing a number of plot holes.All in all, a good film. Not even a good film compared to the other Steven Seagal films listed here, it is actually a good film if you're in the mood for, and can tolerate, mindless action.",Under Siege
128,shortround8391,Seagal's most enjoyable movie,9,4 April 2009,"After spending a few years as a martial arts instructor and after starring in some mediocre action flicks (Above the Law, Hard to Kill, Marked for Death), Steven Seagal hit his peak in 1992 with ""Under Siege"" that was a box office hit and after this he probably started to get ahead of himself and made a atrocious effort at film directing with ""On Deadly Ground"" and after that he was never the same all because of his ego. But we still have this to remember him by when he at his best.It's actually not as bad as I thought it was going to be, but it still has a few flaws. Casey Ryback ""the lowly, lowly cook"" might be somewhat interesting since he is the only character played by Seagal that has some humanity in him. This is perhaps most evident in the scene when two of his boys are dancing to hip-hop music and you can tell that's apparently enjoying himself and enjoying that his cooks are having fun. And also the scene when he finds out that perhaps his closest friend, the Captain was killed and gives him a proper respectful memorial of him. And you can tell that he's upset by it. So at least we get to see Seagal in another kind of character besides those annoying wooden performances that he usually puts forth.Tommy Lee Jones as William Strannix is another high point of ""Under Siege"", since even though he's a little over-the-top, he doesn't show any shame, embarrassment or awkwardness for acting that way. He delivers his lines perfectly, but because of the material he was given he wasn't really as threatening as Clarence Boddicker of Robocop, The Joker in The Dark Knight or Anton Chigurgh of No Country for Old Men were. But he was still very entertaining to watch and a very realistic psychopath.Gary Busey as Commander Krill is not really as memorable here and his flame was starting to wear out after his great role as ""Buddy Holly"" in the 70's. But if you see two names like Jones and Busey as the 2 bad guys in this, then you gotta know that it's worth watching. Busey still manages to put up some tension with Seagal at the beginning when he keeps harassing him and his cooks. Erika Eleniak is absolutely sexy as the damsel in distress in this and makes an unforgettable scene when she pops out of the cake and goes topless for a few seconds, which all those who fantasize about Playboy girls will remember.The action is obviously the high point here, and Seagal delivers some great martial arts as usual. The fistfights the explosions are really great to look at and the sound may have been a a little bit ahead of its time since it was nominated for 2 Oscars related to only the action genre. The knife fight between Ryback and Strannix is one of the better ones I've ever seen thanks to the music and cinematography. And like a said, its basically a rip-off of Die Hard only that it's set in a different place.When you first hear of this film, you might automatically hate it because of Seagal, but give it a chance and its a good way to kill an hour and 40 minutes.",Under Siege
129,Momcat_of_Lomita,"If you have to watch a Steven Seagal movie, make it this one.",10,10 July 2011,"Now that Steven Seagal has become almost a parody of himself, it's easy to scorn the movies he starred in. But there was a time when he was a handsome, charismatic, easy-to-watch action movie star.I guess you'd have to call this movie a ""guilty pleasure"" for me, because in many ways it's a silly plot. It's basically Steven Seagal as a former Navy SEAL, Casey Ryback (who through a series of unfortunate events is now a cook on the USS Missouri on her final voyage), saving the world from nuclear Armageddon with the help of a Playboy centerfold, Jordan Tate, played by Erika Eleniak. The perpetrator of the evil-doing is Tommy Lee Jones as a CIA operative named William Stranix gone rogue. Stranix is assisted by the second-in-command of Big Mo, Cmdr. Krill, played by Gary Busey, who is obviously psychopathically crazy. (One of the unsettling things about the movie is how comfortable Busey's Commander Krill is in pantyhose, a dress and HUGE fake boobs. Now that's scary!) A series of unfortunate coincidences leaves Seagal's Ryback as the only obstacle standing between Stranix and Krill off-loading Big Mo's nuclear weapons onto a North Korean submarine waiting to rendezvous with them mid-ocean. The crew is trapped beneath decks. Stranix and Krill don't know that Ryback is loose, don't know he's an ex-SEAL, and have completely forgotten about the Playboy centerfold they brought onto the ship as part of the ruse to get Stranix on board.And so the fun begins, and it really is fun! It's pure good vs. evil with Seagal, the centerfold, and a few members of the crew fighting off all the baddies and saving Honolulu from being turned into a radioactive puddle of recycled lava.It's suspenseful and fun, and Tommy Lee Jones is absolutely a riot as he hams it up as the evil and possibly insane Stranix. Busey's Krill is so nasty that you've got to love to hate him. Eleniak as the hapless Jordan Tate is surprisingly likable and effective as the tag-along to Seagal who proves that she's not just another pretty face and set of boobs. She does a nice job in this movie.The ending is, of course, predictable: Seagal is going to save the day and end up covered in glory as he modestly accepts his medals for heroism, and the baddies are going to get their comeuppance in some appropriately spectacular fashion. But this movie is genuinely entertaining if you aren't looking for a serious plot or a ""significant"" movie. And if you're a Tommy Lee Jones fan, you're going to absolutely be howling with glee as you watch him ham it up as Stranix.And you may appreciate that although Steven Seagal isn't a world-class actor, with the right kind of movie and supporting cast he can be very watchable. I enjoyed this movie and I can recommend it as pure fun entertainment.",Under Siege

Ryback must thwart a group of terrorists lead by William Stranix (Tommy Lee Jones), a former US Navy Seal, from seizing control of a US Navy battleship.Most of Seagal's movies are disposable or ridiculous at best. 'Under Siege' may not be much better than Seagal's other work, but it does provide some edge-of-the-seat action and keeps its audience entertained.  That makes up for its at times laughably bad dialogue.  When Jordan (former Baywatch girl Erika Eleniak), the movie's babe, is asked by members of the Dept. of Defence to pass the radio to Ryback, she responds, ""He is currently in a gunfight, can I take a message?""

However, viewing this film a few years later, I found it to be as poorly acted as any other performance that Seagal has done and the plot is just ridiculously far-fetched. After a few viewings, even Lee Jones and Busey do not seem very convincing. As stated by many other IMDb reviewers, this plot is simply ""Die Hard"" set out at sea. Also noted is how Erika Eleniak's character transforms from a topless dancer into a combat veteran in a matter of minutes with a quick firearms lesson from Seagal, just seems absurd. The tempo of this film is typical action-movie stuff and the storyline development is just plain awful. Just about as convincing as any other of Seagal's roles. Not recommended.",Under Siege

At the end of the flick, he nails her with a kiss. I'm sorry but Steve is old enough to be her dad.

Then, you get to see Tommy Lee Jones play bad (in my opinion) and its nice to see that even he is not perfect. Then, its a Steven Seagal movie and you get to see the people with big authority be the bad guys. I am not sure that Steven Seagal is a nice person in his real life, but if you want to see a film where the people in power have dirty hands, then you need to see one of his films.

137,manalone923,Seagal's best film,10,5 March 2004,"I gave this movie a solid ten, and I stick with it. I'm not in particular a fan of Steven Seagal, though I don't arbitrarily hate him like many critics do. In fact, this was the first of his movies I'd seen, and I liked it immediately.For any people expecting this movie to deviate from the usual formula of (1): Seagal is wronged, (2): Seagal becomes killing machine, you'll be disappointed. Almost everything in this movie is to be expected, as Seagal plays his usual tough but lovable good guy who gets pushed just a bit too far and goes into full-on expert martial arts killer to enact revenge. A dozen or so people will die, as many or more limbs will be broken, and Seagal will do it all with as much emotion as a stick. To those expecting more of Seagal's usual stuff, that's what you'll get.But in my opinion, what we also get are some inexplicably high level bad guys for this outing. Although about a decade or two behind today's times (keeping in mind the film itself is a decade and a half old), the two antagonists are the well known actors Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Busey. While getting on in their age nowadays, these two were some of the most crazed and entertaining actors of the 70s and 80s. Jones is probably best known from The Fugitive, for which he won an academy award, while Gary Busey has done a boatload of famous, not-so famous, and video game voiceover work. Together, these veterans almost steal the show as they chew the scenery and provide Seagal's most colorful and charismatic characters. Busey is a former ship's commander who's willing to drown his crew simply to taunt Seagal, whereas Jones' character used to send body parts to his ex-bosses at the CIA before turning up here.The plot of this movie is that the two aforementioned crazies, with an entire crew of inside tech guys and hired muscle, have overtaken the aircraft carrier USS Missouri, with plans to extort various things from the big guys in Washington with the ship's small but capable arsenal of weapons at their disposal. The catch is that a high-ranking ex-navy seal is on the ship, serving a commuted sentence for misbehavior. Stuck here as the ship's cook, Seagal plays Casey Ryback who must do whatever he can to rally the ship back into responsible hands.Strangely enough, the movie departs in several ways from the regular formula. The aforementioned bad guys are not only one head honcho but two equally ambitious ones, as well as a capable force of a dozen or so armed men. But where one would expect Seagal to be alone, this time the film adds at least a little credibility to the mix: Seagal still raises hell, but he also has to get the help of several others stowed on the ship if he's to have any chance in operating its guns and other functions. In a film rooted in implausability, it's at least nice to see old Steve actually running around with some admitted help.The pace is interesting, as the early scenes in the movie set up some beautiful shots of the ship as well as some of its intricate interiors and set pieces. Some characters are the token one-line kills, but then there are some side characters who are given their own personality and a scene or two to take advantage of. Many characters from the aforementioned Fugitive (1993) make returns in this movie, as well as a decent character played by Colm Meaney, who was Miles 'O Brien to Star Trek fans.Probably the only annoying bit of this movie is the female lead, played by Playboy model Erika Eleniak. She does a serviceable job, shows her breasts for a minute like she's expected to, and sometimes comes across as a believable person. But for the most part, she's there to lend support to Seagal, and add a little comic repartee between them. I didn't really mind her until she had a silly turn as hero(ine) for a minute or two.But that's a minor quibble, in a film that I still love as being Seagal's most tight, interesting and energetic. It somehow seems more well written or polished than all his other efforts, and this is no doubt aided by the considerable time that is spent establishing the villains, who I've already noted as being the best Seagal's had to tackle. The sequel to this one was quite a letdown but still fun on its own, but in my opinion the original is Seagal's best and a great choice for those looking for some good old fashioned action heroics",Under Siege

All the stunts, explosions and gun fights were done very well and so was the script and story although it did remind me of the Die Hard storyline.Seagal performs well but nothing special or much different from his stereotypical martial arts expert ex special forces characters that he seems to always play, Tommy Lee Jones is a good bad guy and plays the crazy kill everyone persona very well, No complaints about the supporting cast i just wish there were more Baddies for Seagal to kill as the fight choreography was some of his best sorry for mentioning that again.as this is a great action movie and one of the best of its time i recommend you watch it i give it 8 out of 10",Under Siege

While it does have explosive kind of action, its stealthy infiltration scenes are also (and maybe even more) gripping! The actors play their roles very well, and the plot makes the experience almost like watching a game of chess against two highly skilled players. At the same time, to me the story is believable with none of the characters coming across as all-knowing or all-powerful: they take risks, make mistakes, get hurt, etc. I especially like Segal's portrayal of a humble warrior, catching the enemy off-guard by underplaying his skills.

144,SpotMonkee,Enjoyable Die Hard-knockoff,8,25 November 2015,"I don't like Steve Seagal. I honestly don't thing anybody really likes Steve Seagal. Most of his movies are pretty terrible and go direct-to-video. But to every rule there is an exception, and that exception is the 1992 action-thriller, Under Siege (aka Die Hard on a Battleship). Our story follows Casey Ryback (Seagal in one of his better performances) a cook on-board the soon-to-be-retired USS Missouri and ex-Navy SEAL (aren't they all?). Ryback remains a constant pain for the disliked Commander Krill (Gary Busey in full- on Busey mode), who in fact intends to hijack the ship alongside Strannix (Tommy Lee Jones, the best actor in the film) during the Captain's birthday party. Freeing himself from a meat locker (don't ask), Ryback and Miss July 1989 (Erika Eleniak) fight to free the ship from its captors. From the plot description I just gave, this probably sounds like a parody of action movies you would find on The Simpsons. And in many respects, it is. But the rather generic plot is handled well, fast-paced and with enough action to keep audiences satisfied. Director Andrew Davis (The Fugitive, Holes) handles the many shootouts well, with smooth tracking shots through the ship's narrow corridors giving the action a sense of energy while remaining comprehensible. Busey and Jones' banter is a constant source of (mostly intentional) laughs, and Basil Poledouris' work on the score is excellent as always.

They've had bad, uninteresting stories, and not alot of good action-scenes in them either. But ""Under Siege"" has it all--a good plot, great action scenes, and Tommy Lee Jones, and Jones' plays a cool character (which he usually does...) even as the main bad guy.I think ""Under Siege"" is a very fine action-movie, and--like said--Seagals best movie. And when I even mention that Seagals acting performance isn't bad in this film (which isn't always the fact in the other movies of his), then you know it's well worth watching.",Under Siege

The action is great and all the actors are wonderful. Steven Seagal is Casey Ryback an ex-Navy Seal who is on board as the captains personal cook. After the ship has set sail for its last voyage the sailors hold a surprise Birthday party for the captain. Tommy Lee Jones plays an ex CIA operative who wants payback on the men who tried to have him killed.

150,matthew-lamb,Seagals only half decent film,5,18 April 2005,"I'm not a fan of Steven Seagal - his films, so a work colleague pointed out - usually have a hidden ""envirionmental awareness"" agenda. Yet his greasy hair must release more emissions than a D Reg Ford. This film is OK though, its a good watch. Its plot is entertaining enough and Tommy Lee Jones puts in a good performance as William Stranix. Stranix and his mercenaries take over a US warship by posing as entertainment for the captains birthday party. As the staff are taken hostage (or killed), all hope looks to be lost - but, wait - the saviour is in the shape of cook (yes, cook) Kasey Ryback (Seagal), an ex SEAL who is an expert at one-on-one combat and explosives (but not acting) A great appearance from ex Baywatch star Erika Eleniak who you first see jumping out of a birthday cake topless (nice) A good enough film to watch, in a nutshell the good and bad points are:+ Tommy Lee Jones, OK Plot Steven Seagala moderate 5/10",Under Siege
151,bomzh44,One of Steven's Best,7,12 June 2001,"«Under Siege» is considered to be one of Seagal's best movies. Although it doesn't contain that many aikido episodes (like his early movies «Niko» & «Hard to Kill»), for which Steven is so famous, «US» is still an action spectacular. A good thing here is that the story isn't Steven's usual not-to-clever-&-hard-to-make-ends-meet thing. A lot of credit goes to the movie's setting - a great naval battleship «The Missouri». It's long winding tunnels giving much to suspense & combat scenes. Then of course there is the cast - the beautiful Erika Eleniak(Jordan Tate -Miss July 1989) and the baddies Tommy Lee Jones(Stranix) and Gary Busey(Commander Krill). The former Commander Krill being the envious fool and Stranix being Ryback's shadowy counterpart (watch out for the last knife fight scene). The movie's musical score consists of some Rock and sinister tracks which help to fully enjoy the movie. All in all - if you are Seagal's fan, I'm surprised you still haven't seen «US»; if you are looking for a good action movie - its your choice and a good thing to start your Steven Seagal movie collection.",Under Siege
152,sfcat,Great action flick,9,10 August 2013,"I'm really surprised to see such a low average. In my mind, it's Steven Segal's best film, and it's an excellent action movie. It moves at a great pace, the plot is not too trite or unoriginal, especially for the time, and most of it was believable. It's a great popcorn movie!In short, Steven Segal is the captains friend For some reason he's working as ship's cook Something he's good at, but he's been demoted- I don't recall if we ever found out explicitly why, there's some talk of him getting in trouble, but I don't think they tell us the detail. A surprise party goes wrong, so there's a pretty girl involved when everything goes to heck.",Under Siege
153,Dolemite_motherfcker,Very good,8,28 August 2011,"Under Siege is the most well known movie to star washed up 90s action movie star Steven Seagal. Seagal is a big-league jackass but that doesn't stop me from liking his first five movies, which include Under Siege.Ex Navy SEAL Casey Ryback (Steven Seagal) is a cook on a battleship. A group of mercenaries lead by a rogue CIA agent take over the ship, intending to sell the ship's nuclear missiles on the black market by unloading them onto a submarine. The bad guys intend to cover their escape by firing nukes at Honolulu which will kill a million people. With all the ship's personnel imprisoned, it's pretty much up to Seagal to stop them. He shoots, punches, kicks, stabs, chokes and gouges bad guys. Complete with ample explosions, this movie really does deliver on the action front. The body count is respectable, but the filmmakers knew that good action is not just about people dying. There is a creativity to the action besides the various methods of violence. In keeping with the film's silly plot is consistent mild humor, not unlike Con Air and Speed.Ryback, typical of characters played by the egotistical Seagal, seems to be the toughest guy in the world, killing bad guy after bad guy with ease and retaining an almost superhuman calm throughout the whole ordeal. Whether Seagal is as tough as he says he is, (highly doubtful) it works, and the guy is at least a skilled martial artist. Ryback is friendly and humble. Ironically, Seagal is always good at being likable in his movies. The best thing about the movie is the villains. Tommy Lee Jones is William Strannix, the former CIA agent in charge of the bad guys. This is one interesting character. He has been driven insane by the pressure of his job and left without faith in civilization after an attempt on his life by the CIA. He wants money, but also has strong personal motivations. He wants to strike back at the establishment that betrayed him and has a nihilistic desire to carry out his terrible nuclear threat, which of course he attempts to do. This is a great character who you are likely to root for. He never kills anyone personally. You could forget that he is the bad guy. Exuding his Tommy Lee Jones charm, the humorous amusement he shows over his undertaking is funny and never viscous like Speed's Howard Payne or Cliffhanger's Eric Qualen. When Seagal has inevitably ruined his plans, his reaction is not furious raving but bizarre, crazy ramblings about Saturday morning cartoons. Commander Krill, played by Gary Busey is an officer on board the battleship who helps Strannix and his team take over. He is a psychopath with a grudge against the whole crew of the ship and Ryback (Seagal) especially. ""They never liked me anyway"" he says when he attempts to drown his captive fellow crew members. He behaves like a standard bad guy but Busey is my favourite actor and his voice and delivery are gold. Then you've got Colm Meaney, your average straight man third in command bad guy. His Irish accent makes him somewhat amusing. The other villains make great Seagal fodder. The screenwriters managed to fit in the supporting role of a real life/in the movie playboy centerfold chick who follows Seagal around and manages to give him a lot of help and does a little dance with some upper frontal nudity. Yep.If you are expecting to be moved by this film, like perhaps you were at the end of Die Hard, you will be disappointed. This movie is in sharp contrast to Die Hard in this respect. Die Hard has that very emotive score. Gary Chang's score for this movie is adventurous but unemotional. It is befitting of Seagal's cool headed character, who is very different to Die Hard's impassioned Mclane. The obvious intention to keep this film unemotional leaves something to be desired, keeping the film from being as exciting as it could have been, but it's not entirely a bad thing. Sometimes you don't want to watch an emotional movie and a creative movie with excellent villains and plenty of violence and explosions would hit the spot.",Under Siege

155,chetanbluej,Awsm blend of raw action and gullible innocence!!!,9,8 May 2018,"Steven Seagal has set a trademark for his films, if he is in it you can, no doubt, expect cool action n strategy. Apart from his stellar nautral performance as an Ex-SEAL turned cook character, what I really want to stress on is the performance of the actress Erika Eleniak had exhibited in portraying the character of one miss July 1989 a.k.a Jordan Tate. Her timed dialogues made the movie posses a necessary tinge of subtle humour.
 But what I LOVED the most was her superb ability to act SOOOOO innocent as the character demands. Her character's transformation into a better person, Jordan's faith in Casey's abilities to turn the table and all other tiny miscellaneous contributions to the movie, on Erika's part, was highly APPRECIABLE! I suggest ppl to observe and be drowned in her character's innocence.
 A big shout out to the casting team, the sound effects team and the screenplay personnel for giving the movie their best, as it is their commitmment that has made the movie enjoyable even after 2 decades!!!!
 WE LOVE you ERIKA!!!!! :) :))))))",Under Siege
156,sarah-160,Steven Seagal at his very best,10,25 June 2000,"This is one of my favourite movies of all time.

A must to all action fans.",Under Siege
157,Beard_Warning,Underwhelming,6,30 January 2005,"A review of this film only really needs 5 words - ""Die Hard on a boat"", and no doubt this is how the producers of the film pitched it to the studio. Instead of the wisecracking Willis here we has the rather soporific Seagal.The plot is the usual tosh (well, it's not like we are not expecting Shakespeare from the author of ""Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle Of Death""). Terrorists - including an over the top Tommy Lee Jones and the ubiquitous Gary Busey (does he every play a good guy?) - take over a ship equipped with nukes. It's down to the ship's cook (Seagal) - conveniently an explosives expert - to save the day.This is viewed by some as Seagal's masterpiece - perhaps a slight misuse of the word, but it seems like ""Citizen Kane"" compared to his more recent direct to video work.Segall goes about dispatching his foes with a series of Heath Robinson-esquire explosive traps. A problem with Seagall's work is the lack of comedy - there is none of the cartoon violence of Jackie Chan or the smarmy comments of a Bond or a John McClane. Erika Eleniak tags along in full blubbing bimbo mode.The high points of the movie come when Eleniak bursts out of a birthday cake bearing her fabulous breasts for the world (before inexplicably bursting into one of her blubbing fits).Andrew Davis - the master of mediocre - directs with his usual competent but dull style. Admittedly this is notch above his ""Chain Reaction"" (also written by Lawton) but not as good as his ""Fugitive"" or ""Perfect Murder"".Overall it's just Die Hard on a boat.",Under Siege

A shame his latest ones are so different in quality. Pamela Basker did a wonderful job in casting. Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Busey as the villains are superb. The fight scenes are exquisite. The soundtrack of the movie is great. Actor I enjoyed the most in this movie: Steven Seagal. Actor I enjoyed the least in this movie: Erika Eleniak. I try my best to find something bad about the movie but I can't - this is the ultimate action movie, same level for me with Taken and The Bourne Identity. A Must Watch recommendation!",Under Siege

It's so ridiculous and cliche but man oh man it's just so much fun to watch. Gary is typical Gary. Tommy Lee is insanely talented and awesome as Bill. Hell even the USS Missouri is a great supporting character in its own.I revisited this gem last night after maybe 15 years. Just as fun to watch now as then.,Under Siege
160,fregger,Sometimes funny - but seldom on purpose.,3,4 April 2005,"Under Siege has one merit : you can hear good old insults and bad words from the early nineties that you don't find anymore in nowadays action movies, and it is sometimes funny. One or two lines are indeed witty. Steven Seagal runs the ship with one machine-gun in each hand, CROSSING the arms, and killing villains by the dozen without even looking at them. The clichés are so huge that you (almost) always end up laughing after thinking for a second ""it is not possible that they used such a old big fat trick ?"".By instance, when the happy ending occurs, all the admirals, generals and President's advisers display so much emotion that you'd rather figure them as the Super Bowl winning team. Or the Girl that shoots the bad guy just before he kills Steven Seagal after having said that she would not kill anybody ; of course, the scene let you think that the shot was from the Bad Guy's gun, and when the Bad Guys falls, you see the Girl with her gun. Deja vu ? Besides, the acting is bad. Steven Seagal plays business as usual (one look, even less than Jean-Claude Van Damme), Tommy Lee Jones overplays so much that you would not believe that Under Siege was made just one year before The Fugitive. At least, Out for Justice was bettered by the stunning performance of the under-estimated William Forsythe. Gary Busey - though rather good in Point Break - does not act much better, and the Girl may be the best character - which, for an action movie, tells the whole story about acting. Of course, you can see her tits in one of the most meaningless scene of the whole movie history.It would be too boring to detail plot holes and unrealistic events - the best being the former Playmate of July 1989 joining the Navy and serving on the battleship in two days.",Under Siege

After just recently re-watching it after a number of years I have decided to give it a brief review. Gary Bousey, Steven Segal, and Tommy Lee Jones all gave very breakout and believable performances. Although Tommy Lee Jones was the show stealer in this film, Steven and Gary both gave performances that put a smile on my face because this is when they were ""A-list"" to me. The writing was okay. There was moments as in traditional Hollywood that just didn't make sense. For one (Spoiler!!!) a ship that valuable with weapons that dangerous, I would think would have a lot more armed me throughout the ship for security and the Captain was just to lazy in that he allowed his XO to pull all roving patrols away without having any kind of fail safe. Being a military guy myself I think that the way that the hijack went down, it was just too far fetched.

It recognises that even in the 'good world' 'the good' can fall from grace. There are also those whose historical backgrounds prevent them from having enjoined in the struggle in the past and have no commitment to maintaining the present world order. Then the 'innocent' who enter into the struggle echoing the courageous involvement of those caught up in past 'great' wars. The film also involves an individual that is well beyond fighting age who is integral in delivering the final blow to the enemy. Steven Seagal delivers his role in a believable and quiet way. His martial arts skills and status achieved in Japan make Stephen Seagals action scenes effective and believable.This is also a film that I find I can watch again and again.",Under Siege

Violent and not particularly literary but worthy entry in action genre and realized in ¨Die hard¨ style. Wooden Seagal plays the violent Casey Ryback, he cleans up the battleship by means of punches, kicks, bounds and leaps, martial arts skills with fights certainly is slick.The Aikido expert Seagal saves the day in this exciting movie which he also co-produced .In the film appear many secondary roles played by prestigious actors as Patrick O'Neal,Colm Meany, Damian Chapa, Raymond Cruz , Bernie Casey, Nick Mancuso and several others.This elaborately produced action film with two-fisted Seagal is just another action film full of struggles ,thrills, noise and lots of violence. Steven Seagal as almost always, plays a stalwart and lone fighter, BUT, he delivers the goods in his own style full of usual violence and fights with snapping wrists and flying bodies.Unfortunately, these days, a much heftier Seagal does mostly low budget and direct to video garbage , such as ¨Half past dead¨, ¨The foreigner¨ and its sequel, ¨Shadow man ¨, ¨Flight of fury¨, ¨Urban justice¨ and many others.",Under Siege
