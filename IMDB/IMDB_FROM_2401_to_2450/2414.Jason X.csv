0,TheLittleSongbird,Horror in space,3,11 January 2018,"'Friday the 13th' may have been panned by critics when first released but since then it is one of the most famous and influential horror films, the franchise containing one of horror's most iconic villains. The film is popular enough to become a franchise and spawn several sequels of varying quality and generally inferior to the one that started it all off. Due to the location and incorporating space and sci-fi, on top of all the expected 'Friday the 13th' elements then some, 'Jason X' is certainly different and a little credit is due for that. For a 'Friday the 13th' film it and 'Jason Takes Manhattan' are pretty unique as far as the series goes. 'Jason X' is an example of different not really being a good thing. Interesting idea and understand totally what the film was trying to do, but it was messily executed. The strengths and faults are pretty much the same as with the previous entry 'Jason Goes to Hell', excepting 'Jason X' is marginally better because it tried to be different.A couple of creative and disturbing deaths and some inventive and stylish camera work lift 'Jason X' to a better level.One good performance too, which comes from Kane Hodder. Again creeping and chilling the socks off the viewer as Jason. However, those are the only praises really that can be given. The music is a little appealing on the ears, but it still doesn't have the eeriness and mystery that the pre-'Jason Goes to Hell' films had so brilliantly and doesn't fit as adeptly. That is the least bad though of the drawbacks, which are pretty much the same as those of the worst 'Friday the 13th' films but even worse than before. Again, like 'Jason Goes to Hell', while a good deal of 'Friday the 13th' films are silly, the silliness here is overkill that it becomes insultingly ridiculous. 'Jason X' is one of the most unique conceptually of the series, but it sure is one of the strangest to the point of overdone weirdness.'Jason X' tonally feels muddled and like it was trying to do too much with too many elements screaming of kitchen-sink. If it tried to do less it would perhaps have been a better film. Hodder aside, the acting is really horrendously amateur hour, even for the 'Friday the 13th' films where acting rarely was a strength. Likewise with the dialogue, which is even worse than 'Jason Goes to Hell', with 'Friday the 13th' at its most taking-simplicity-to-extremes, stilted, cheesiest and lacking in taste. Scariness and suspense is nil, instead going for witless comedy and gratuitous gore and nudity. The deaths go for quantity rather than quality, and generally are not particularly imaginative or creepy. The story is paper thin and confused, with too hectically paced storytelling and there is the sense that the series has gotten really stale even with a change in location.Overall, lame. 3/10 Bethany Cox",Jason X
1,Leofwine_draca,Fast-paced sci-fi horror packed with incident and bloodshed,6,7 August 2016,"So Jason is back, and in a big way, with possibly the most expensive movie of the series so far and certainly the most special effect-filled one. Following on from JASON GOES TO HELL, which changed the core concept by having Jason becoming an evil slug that jumped from person to person, here we have the traditional hockey-masked killer back, but the setting is a futuristic spaceship in the style of many recent B-movie sequels. Thankfully, the film is still violent at heart, and for a 15 certificate film it offers some of the most imaginatively gory moments I've seen in a long time. People are decapitated, cut in half, thrown onto enormous drill-bits, get impaled, electrocuted, have their throats slit, and plenty more. Certainly the film's most notorious sequence is also the most inventive, having a young blonde lady getting her face frozen in liquid nitrogen, then smashed apart on a work surface – this is without a doubt the most disgusting thing I've seen on screen in a long, long time.The formula is predictable, involving young good-looking heroes and heroines narrowly evading Jason at every turn, but the special effects are better. Certainly the kills are authentic-looking and the CGI shots are fun if not particularly convincing. Set design is spot on, and elements of the traditional Friday the 13th music are more than welcome. Like it or not, things do become very cheesy as the film progresses, introducing the 'Uber-Jason', a nanobot-modified killer who looks more like the Terminator than Mr. Voorhees, and the climax, set in space, is totally off the wall and utterly unbelievable.The main thing, though, is that this film is fun, and a whole load of fun at that. There's plenty of self-knowing humour, black comedy and the young cast do a lively job. The film introduces a new hard-assed action hero in Tony Todd-lookalike Peter Mensah who I'd certainly like to see more of (and thankfully I did, when he took a lead role in the smash TV series SPARTACUS). And it wouldn't be the same without stuntman Kane Hodder, as huge and hulking as ever, who positively delights in a return to his famous role. So, fans of the series will delight in this entry which is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time; it never lets up from the start and offers enough blood and guts to satisfy any horror fan's appetite. An absolute delight.",Jason X
2,SnoopyStyle,High cheese factor,4,21 October 2013,"Jason Voorhees is finally captured by the U.S. government and held at the Crystal Lake Research Facility. They can't find a way to kill him. Scientist Rowan LaFontaine (Lexa Doig) decides to freeze Jason in cryogenic suspension. Jason escapes and Rowan is just able to freeze both him and herself. 455 years later a scientific team returns to a desolate earth and finds the frozen bodies. They bring the two on their ship, but the reanimated Jason just can't stop killing.This movie borrows heavily from Alien, Blade Runner and many others. It just does it without the tension or style. It is cheesy camp. The only good thing is that director James Isaac knows it. He's made a hopeless B-movie with a high cheese factor.",Jason X
3,kosmasp,If there's no more space (for Jason) on Earth ...,5,13 November 2020,"His victims will walk .. a spaceship? Not sure that famous line Ken Foree uttered is ripe for this Jason remix/update, but hopefully you'll take this attempt at humor with a pinch of salt. I would argue that this is fun, but while we seem to have really gone everywhere (maybe it would have been fun to follow Jason to Hell and see what he'd be up to there? How about meeting Ted and Bill and ... ok maybe now I lost you with that silly idea) ... but are we willing to follow him? This will be up to you.The makers made clear they were just a stepping stone to the Freddy vs. Jason movie everyone was expecting ... which came and ... unfortunately didn't do too much either. And we'll probably will never see the one I wanted even more: Ash vs. Freddy vs. Jason ... man that would have been a hoot. But it's always about balance. And talking about that, the kills here are quite good, but the aged CGI will probably put some people off. It is not entirely bad, but you can see most of the effects clearly as that ... will be up to you, if that bothers you. Finally this is the last outing of Kane Hodder as Jason on film ... which is a shame! I always liked that Freddy was played by one person (except the reboot that is).",Jason X
4,jboothmillard,Jason X,6,9 January 2006,"This tenth film of the Friday the 13th sequels is quite a good one, but I thought Jason was dead by the end of Jason Goes To Hell (Part 9). Anyway, he's still alive somehow and this time, he's travelling to the future. Basically Jason Voorhees (Kane Hodder) is cryogenically frozen, along with a girl, and they both stay for at least 500 years. They manage to thaw out the girl, but knowing of Voorhees psychopathic past, and the fact that he is worth a lot of money, they keep him frozen, but not for long. He is now hunting all the spaceship's crew to find the main girl, and he kills them all in cool, gory and pretty disturbing ways. He does look dead at one point, until some space ants reconstruct him, but he's probably dead now that he was blown up in space. Best death is probably a woman being dunked in liquid nitrogen and her head smashed in half like glass. One of the only good Jason Voorhees returns, I do however need to see Goes To Hell. Very good!",Jason X
5,Tweekums,Good mindless fun,7,20 September 2009,"I can't say how this compares to other films in the ""Friday the Thirteenth"" franchise as I'd only seen one of them before and that was twenty years ago. Thankfully you don't really need to have seen previous instalments to understand what is going on. We are told several times that the hockey mask wearing Jason Vorhees is an unstoppable killer then we see him killing lots of people who's efforts to kill him barely slow him down.I don't know if it was deliberate but this film seemed to have elements of lots of other science fiction films including: Alien (unstoppable killer in space), Demolition Man (Killer and person who knows what he is cryogenically frozen) and Aliens (gung-ho space soldiers killed easily and somebody trying to keep the danger alive for money). While this might make the film derivative it didn't spoil the entertainment for me.The film opens with Jason chained up in preparation for cryogenic imprisonment at a facility run by Rowan, a scientist played by Lexa Doig. Soon the military turn up to take Jason away for research but before one can say ""psycho killer"" Jason is out of his chains and they are dead. Rowan lures him to the cryogenic chamber and captures him, unfortunately for her he breaches the container and she is also frozen. Four hundred years later the Earth is uninhabitable and the facility is being examined by archaeologists who find Rowan and Jason and take them back to their spaceship. Once there they thaw Rowan and assure her that Jason is dead. Of course he is soon on his feet killing scantily clad students and soldiers in a variety of imaginative ways.While nobody was about to win any acting Oscars for this I thought Lexa Doig did a good enough job as Rowan, Lisa Ryder was OK as android Kay-Em 14 and Peter Mensah put in a decent performance as Sgt. Brodski, the rest of the cast were fairly forgettable, they were just there to look pretty and die. The special effects were pretty good for the most part, certainly better than I'd expected from part ten of a slasher franchise.Several people have said this will only appeal to fans of the series, I have to disagree with this as I thought it was fun... perhaps it only appeals to fans of the series or fans of second rate science fiction.",Jason X
6,BA_Harrison,Not to be taken seriously.,8,13 June 2008,"Earth, 2010: Jason (Kane Hodder), the unkillable hockey-mask-wearing-lunatic from Camp Crystal Lake, is being held in a top secret government base. When he inevitably breaks free, government researcher Rowan (Alexa Doig) lures the lumbering maniac into a cryogenic chamber where they are both frozen for 400 years, until the crew of a spacecraft visiting the now desolate planet Earth discovers their perfectly preserved bodies and thaws them out...Up to this point, mass murderer Jason Vorhees has been drowned, macheted, axed, buried, reanimated, melted, blown to pieces, and dragged to Hell. Knowing full well that any attempt at making the next chapter in the Friday the 13th franchise in any way scary or believable would be a futile exercise, the film's makers took the only route left to them: they made Jason X a gloriously silly and tongue-in-cheek popcorn flick, full of creative deaths, gung-ho action, and flashy special effects. The result is a film totally unlike any other in the series, and one that will appeal to fans who enjoy a large helping of cheese with their horror.Featuring several smokin' hot women, a sexy android, virtual reality monsters, a team of marines with big guns, nanobots that can mend almost any injury, and, ultimately, the introduction of a new improved cyborg Jason, this film is an intentionally funny piece of mindless entertainment, and I loved it.But don't go thinking that, because this one ain't taking things seriously any more, it wimps out on the gore, 'cos it doesn't: the violence is as frequent and as bloody as always, and also very imaginative, with one kill in particular ranking amongst the best of the entire series: a sexy scientist gets her face plunged into liquid nitrogen and then smashed into small pieces on a work surface, leaving a red crystalline crater in her head.After much death and mayhem, an exciting finale sees Jason go head-to-head with the android (kitted up in PVC and wielding two high-powered hand cannons), revisit a virtual Camp Crystal Lake to slaughter a couple of topless bimbos, and, after escaping an explosion in space, burn up as he enters the atmosphere of Earth 2.",Jason X
7,paul_haakonsen,A spoof on its own franchise?...,6,16 December 2015,"This movie sent a large following away from the franchise in utter disbelief. And I will say that ""Jason X"" is a very different ""Friday the 13th"" experience. It actually seems like it is meant as a spoof and a farce on its own franchise. You take Jason Voorhees and put him in a cryo-freeze, then thaw him up in the distant future and put him into space...It is, of course, a matter of taste and personal preference whether or not you like the tenth movie and its deviant turn away from its usual formula. I enjoyed it, seeing it as a fun approach to the franchise.There were some interesting things throughout the movie, especially with what happens to Jason, which spurred the 'evil gets an upgrade' catchphrase of the movie.The effects were fun and good, as you have been witnessing all throughout the series of the movies. There were a good amount of killings in ""Jason X"" of course, as in all these movies. And there were some good laughs here as well.And ""Jason X"" has Kane Hodder as Jason Voorhees, which is more than enough of a reason to watch the movie. And a special appearance by none other than David Cronenberg.If you like the ""Friday the 13th"" movies and want a break away from the usual setting of the Voorhees movies then sit down and Watch ""Jason X"". It is fun for what it is.",Jason X
8,Quinoa1984,Gets my nomination for the Ed Wood movie of the year,5,1 May 2002,"When a picture goes out of its way (or rather along its usual route) to be absolutely terrible in craftsmanship and style and yet goes for big unintentional laughs, like Jason X, it garners my nomination for the Faux Ed Wood award which should be given to movies that bring bad horror to a tee. So stupid is this movie that if it tried to be a parody and not a gore fest in space it could rank with the likes of Scary Movie.  The plot is as thin as rolling paper and delivers what you'd expect from a part 10 in a 22 year saga.  Kane Hodder deserves credit for going once again for one of the most dredded characters in horror and yet the film tries to have some fun along it's stomach churning way.  Best scene- the crystal lake dream sequence. D+",Jason X
9,BandSAboutMovies,I like the idea if not the actual movie,5,13 April 2018,"In 2010 - 9 years in the future! - Jason is captured by the U.S. government but can't be killed, so government scientist Rowan LaFontaine decides to place the killer is suspended animation. Of course, a bunch of soldiers screws the whole thing up and Jason kills everyone in his path before he stabs Rowan and freezing both of them.445 years later, Earth is ruined so everyone moves to Earth 2. So why not send some students back to the old Earth on a field trip? Why not send their professor and an android, too? While exploring the Crystal Lake facility where Jason was experimented on? And why not put the still frozen bodies of Jason and Rowan on the Grendel, their ship? Nothing bad can happen, right?Well, it turns out that Jason is dead and his body could be worth plenty. The Professor calls his money man, Dieter Perez (Robert A. Silverman, who has been in five Cronenberg* movies and the two episodes of Friday the 13th: The Series that he directed, too) and they discuss how Jason's body could be worth something to collectors. Luckily - or maybe not - they bring Rowan back to life.Of course, kids keep having sex around Jason, which brings the maniac back to life. He wipes out nearly everyone on the ship, including all of the soldiers that are on board. He even takes out an entire space station!The teens upgrade their android, KM-14, who wipes out Jason. Or so everyone thinks - a medical station brings him back as Uber Jason, filled with cybernetics so powerful that he can punch the android's head off. Not even a holographic simulation or a shuttle crash can slow him down! It takes flying him through re-entry and burning him up to take him out.That said - two teens see his mask land on Earth 2, so he could always come back. He can come back, right?This was written by Todd Farmer (Drive Angry, the remake of My Bloody Valentine) and directed by James Isaac (House 3). I have a real weakness for this film as it really goes places none of the others did. It's the Abbott and Costello school of running out of ideas and just doing something completely off the wall.*Cronenberg shows up in a cameo as Dr. Wimmer, too!",Jason X
10,Coventry,Featuring Jason's number one finest killing moment!,6,24 December 2007,"Up until now my absolute favorite Jason Voorhees killing sequence featured in ""Part 6: Jason Lives"" (or was it part 7?), namely when everyone's beloved hockey-mask wearing mass murderer ties up a sleeping bag with a teenager inside of it and just powerfully smashes it against a tree. That death sequence was awesome because it was just so cruel and relentless, but this tenth and long-awaited (at least by some) installment features one that easily surpasses the tree-smashing and it actually might be  hands down  the number one coolest killing scene of ALL the ""Friday the 13th"" movies. Still fairly early in the film, Jason baptizes a blond girl's face in a cryogenic bath and subsequently smashes her frozen head to pulp against the dresser. Vintage Vorhees move, if you ask me! And even if it wouldn't be for Jason's best kill ever, ""Jason X"" is a tremendously entertaining slasher flick and surely one of the better efforts in the franchise. It looks as if director James Isaac and writer Todd Farmer abandoned all hope to come up with a halfway decent script for this horror series and just simply focused on grotesque gore situations (with marvelous special effects) and a throwback to all the good old clichés and stereotypes of the genre. I must say I like this approach. Why change a winning team, right? The narrative structure is incoherent and illogical as hell, but the film cheerfully moves from one nasty & imaginative butchering sequence to another. The film opens in the not too distant future, where the authorities finally captured Jason but they're unable to execute him due to his unnatural ability to repair his own damaged tissue. An obnoxious scientist (played by no one less than David Cronenberg in a sublime cameo) wants to do further research but inevitably Jason escapes. One doctor manages to lock him up in the cryogenic freezer before dying herself as a result of a machete stab wound. Then, just like that, the year is a 2455 and a class of space teenagers and their teacher stumble upon the frozen bodies. They reanimate the doctor with futuristic techniques (it has to do with ants!), but obviously ol' Jason doesn't need any help coming back to life. He awakes and promptly does what he does best without wondering for one second what year it is or why he's on board of a spaceship. ""Jason X"" is a truly amusing and worthy addition to the legendary horror series. The horny & brainless teenagers at Camp Crystal Lake have been replaced with horny & brainless teenagers in space, the variety of murders is splendid and it has to be said the film contains some downright ingenious little ideas! For example, Jason comically interrupting two geeky students' interactive video game, a recreation of Crystal Lake and  of course  Jason's already notorious transformation into Uber-Space-Jason, with enclosed mask! The special & make-up effects are unquestionably the film biggest trump, and it shouldn't come as a big surprise that director James Isaac's previous work always involved the engineering of special effects. He actually did a lot of work for David Cronenberg (""The Fly"", ""Naked Lunch"", ""eXistenZ""), which immediately explains how he could convince the acclaimed director to appear in a mainly insignificant ninth sequel of a teen-slasher.",Jason X
11,michaelRokeefe,He's back and out of this world.,3,28 September 2003,"Jason Voorhees part ten? The hockey-masked maniac thaws from a cryogenic freeze and goes on a killing spree aboard a spaceship in the year 2455. Enough said? Thought so. Kane Hodder is the machete slicing and dicing Jason. Also in the cast are:Lisa Ryder, Melyssa Ade, Chuck Campbell and Lexa Doig.",Jason X
12,Scarecrow-88,Jason X,7,13 April 2007,"In 2455, serial killer Jason Voorhies(the film confirms he murdered over 200 victims)is accidentally set free from cryogenic stasis to dismantle and destroy a crew on board a transport ship heading home. Along with Jason was Rowan(Lexa Doig)who tried to stop Jason back home on earth where they were both found..it was indeed her who trapped Jason in the cryogenic chamber, was stabbed by Jason using his trademark machete from the inside through her on the outside which opens the coolant to freeze her as well. She understands what kind of zombie monster he is as explained with how they tried many other aspects and methods of death which wouldn't end him. One by one members on board try and fail to stop Jason. Those still alive for the time being contemplate how to escape the ship before he catches up with them.This New Line release, much like the ninth film(JASON GOES TO HELL), takes the Jason model and tries to spin a new, different type of story set in the future allowing the monster fresh new ways to kill humans. Supporters of Jason enacting bloodshed in his normal environs might balk, but a chance to see him out of his normal routine is refreshing. And, the flick plays it's wacky premise to the hilt. The computer effects are decent, if less stellar than normal bigger-budgeted films, but the gore is on display aplenty. One poor soul is cut in half, another is thrown on a drill(the scene shows the man's body sliding down the screw piece), and in the film's best sequence a female medic's head is submerged in cryogenic fluid and smashed over a counter as it shatters into pieces. There's an amusing holograph sequence where they buy time to survive by creating an illusion of Crystal Lake with two nudie cuties distracting Jason. There's even a female android who does battle with Jason(it isn't much of a contest as she has superior firepower that subsequently blows him to bits)..when it appears that he is finally conquered, he is reconstructed by a mechanical device that can repair torn tissue and muscles, into a half-cybernetic being! This is clearly a flick designed for the Friday audience allowing us to see Jason doing what he does best, killing innocents who try their damnedest to escape the terror that awaits them.",Jason X
13,preppy-3,Jason in Space!,7,30 April 2002,"Basic plot: It's 2455 and Jason is loose on a spaceship killing a bunch of brainless, annoying 20 somethings.Critics have been merciless on attacking this.  Why?  It's the 9th sequel to ""Friday the 13th"".  What were they expecting?  ""Gone With the Wind""?  For what it is, this is very good.The plot is old, no characterizations, and the killings aren't really all that interesting (except for one at the beginning which was GREAT).  Also it has an annoying tendancy to have characters say some really stupid jokes WHILE they're dying!!!  The acting is totally horrendous--the worst I've ever seen in a ""Friday..."" film.  I realize that's saying alot but it's true!  All the cliches are squarely in place including the dialogue (""Get your people out of there!""  ""We're all safe here.""  ""He's finally dead.""). Basically this is so bad it's funny!  Also, surprisingly, it wasn't too bad. It had it's dull moments but the characters, acting and lines were so funny...So is is scary?  No.  Is it a good movie?  No.  Is it fun?  VERY.  So far the best bad/good movie of 2002.Extra bonus--Some of the WORST jokes I've ever heard in a movie.",Jason X
14,LeonLouisRicci,The One Film in the Series that is Worth a Watch,7,31 October 2017,"The Fans of this Franchise can Yap all They Want.The ""Friday the 13th/Jason"" Movies were Generic, Witless, Body Count Movies with Nothing More than a Formula of a Soulless Killing Machine that was a Proxy/Surrogate for the Sadistic Tendencies of Male Teens who were Immature and would Cheer each other On during Theater/Video Screenings. These were Member Measuring Contests, and the Movies were sure to Gross Out the Girls with the Slaughter that Jason Provided for Their Pleasure. What Fun!All that has been Said Before with Little Effect. Siskel and Ebert Occasionally did whole Shows Saying Essentially the Same Thing.Jason's Fans are Many and Vocal. The ""Slasher"" Sub-Genre of Horror is and has been a Money Maker for Years. In Fact it's an Age Old Business Model...Paraphrasing...""Never underestimate the tastelessness of the consumer."" The Original, by the way, wasn't even Original. It was Stolen Directly from Mario Bava's Film ""Bay of Blood"" (1971). The Hackers of this Franchise Never Broke any New Ground through 9 Count em' Movies.Finally in the 10th Entry it is at Least Trying Something Different, if Not Completely Different. ""Jumping the Shark"" does Not Apply because the Franchise did that a Long Time Ago.This Movie can be Worth a Watch for something of a Hoot.

15,poolandrews,Highly entertaining 10th instalment of the Friday the 13th series of horror films.,8,9 January 2005,"Location: Crystal Lake Research Facility. Subject: Jason Voorhees. Status:Awaiting Cryogenic Suspension. Indestructible mass murderer Jason Voorhees (Kane Hodder), who is thought to be responsible for over 200 murders, has been captured and is being held prisoner. Dr. Rowan (Lexa Doig) is planning to freeze Jason as all attempts to execute him have failed. Dr. Wimmer (director David Cronenberg) however has other ideas and insists that because Jason can regenerate any damaged tissue he is far to valuable to freeze. Before long Wimmer and his soldiers are all dead and Jason is again on the loose. Rowan manages to trap Jason into the freezing pod and start the process. Jason sticks his machete through the pods door, stabbing Rowan and causing a breach, they are both cryogenically frozen. The film then fast forwards over 400 years into the future to 2455. The Earth can no longer sustain life and is just a barren lifeless wasteland, a bit like some of the UK is now really. Humans now live on Earth 2. Professor Lowe (Jonathan Potts) and four of his students, Janessa (Melyssa Ade), Stoney (Yani Gellman), Kinsa (Melody Johnson) plus Azrel (Dov Tiefenbach) and a babe of a android called Kay-Em 14 (Lisa Ryder) find both Rowan and Jason while on Earth 1 for some reason I can't think of right now, and take them back to their spaceship called the 'Grendel'. They revive Rowan and introduce her to everyone including the other characters we haven't seen yet who are Waylaner (Derwin Jordan) and Kay-Em's programmer Tsunaron (Chuck Campbell). They take Jason to a laboratory so a blonde babe of a student (why were none of my fellow class-mates as beautiful looking as her?) named Adrienne (Kristi Angus, if you ever need a date Kristi drop me an E-mail!) can conduct some experiments on him, and his eyeball. Soon enough Jason is up and walking around and kills Adrienne, shame that I thought she was a real babe and very easy on the eyes! Jason then kills Stoney and sets his sights on everyone else on board! Luckily it just so happens that besides a bunch of students there are also a platoon of heavily armed soldiers on board! But can even Sargeant Brodski (Peter Mensah) and his team of 'grunts', Kicker (Barna Moricz), Briggs (Dylan Bierk), Dallas (a cameo by screenwriter Todd Farmer), Condor (Steve Lucescu), Sven (Thomas Seniuk) and Geko (Amanda Brugel) stop the seemingly invincible Jason? Directed Jim Isaac I had a blast watching this. There are lots of sequences that I had fun with. The script by Todd Farmer never seems to take itself too seriously and moves along like a rocket. The space setting is different for the Friday the 13th films and overall I really liked it. The interior of the spaceship looked suitably futuristic with plenty of computers and bright neon lighting, the props were cool as well with some great over-the-top looking guns and I especially liked Jason's new shiny chrome ultra sleek medical machete. There are some cool kills as well, someone is impaled on a large drill and spins round as they reach the bottom, the total babe Adrienne who I wanted to survive or at least make it further into the film has her face frozen and then smashed to pieces and in a yucky scene she also cuts Jason's hockey mask off his face with a scalpel which reveals Jason's rotting face beneath, there are slit throats, people cut in half, decapitations, mangled bodies and someone has their arm cut off with a machete. This Friday the 13th delivers more gore than most of the previous instalments. I loved the scene where Lisa Ryder dresses up in skin tight PVC, arms herself with some serious firepower and battles it out with Jason, a scene that looks like it could have come straight out of the Matrix (1999), but it's more fun here. The special effects are good, the CGI isn't always brilliant but it more than satisfactory for a relatively low budget film. The acting is OK, at least everyone manages to keep a straight face, and did I mention that Adrienne is a seriously hot looking young lady? David Cronenberg's cameo at the beginning is also rather cool. On the down side it becomes a little too silly for the last 20 or so minutes. I mean Jason flying through space and talking decapitated robotic heads? Overall I think this is a highly entertaining film that I had an absolute blast watching. As long as you don't take it too seriously this is a lot of fun. I'm a huge fan of Friday the 13th (1980) and it's numerous sequels and this is a good one. Highly entertaining, and definitely recommended if your in the right mood.",Jason X
16,Bunuel1976,"JASON X (James Isaac, 2001) *1/2",2,10 November 2006,"The crucial line in this needless futuristic updating of the Crystal Lake critter is the one uttered near the end by the most likable character in the film just as she is about to be dispatched to the next world by our Jason: ""This sucks on so many levels!"" The word ""obnoxious"" has been wildly overused by the undersigned of late but, nevertheless, it once again perfectly encapsulates the characters populating this slasher movie/space saga foremost among them the kinky Professor who has his own greedy designs on Jason's future and the female robot assistant who indulges in an ultimately futile, would-be balletic duel with Jason (or rather his 25th Century upgrade, Uber-Jason)) which sticks out like a sore thumb! I can't write this review without mentioning the most unintentionally funny death scene in the entire series (even if it was all happening in Jason's head) i.e. his beating to death a girl in a sleeping bag with her own companion enclosed in a similar bag!! Incredibly enough, New Line took the Cronenbergian admiration shown in their previous entry to the next level here by managing to convince the maverick Canadian film-maker himself to make a very early appearance in the film as an authority figure of some sort intent on studying the remains of Jason which have been conveniently preserved in a freezing compartment of a hi-tech lab (or something); mercifully, we are spared the vision of his unsurprising comeuppance at the hands of the revived Jason which happens soon after...",Jason X
17,utgard14,"In space, no one can hear you suck",4,23 October 2014,"If you're looking to make a Friday the 13th movie and you come up with the idea of sending Jason into the future and into outer space....maybe it's time you just stop making Friday the 13th movies. This one's a stinker, obviously. It spends more time borrowing from the Aliens movies than it does trying to make a good Jason movie. One thing it does have going for it is that it's more fun than Jason Goes to Hell. There's a lot of comedy, both intended and unintended. The intended is pretty lame but the other is good for some chuckles. It also stars sexy Lexa Doig. Both to her credit and shame, she takes her part seriously. What's there to say about it? If you like the '80s Friday the 13th movies, you'll probably hate this. This is right down there with the Leprechaun series. Oh and I can't believe David Cronenberg does a cameo in this. He must have lost a bet.",Jason X
18,Boba_Fett1138,Pretty lame movie.,4,17 November 2009,"Well, to mean having Jason Voorhees battling a couple of teenagers in space, in the 25th century already sounds like a very lame concept in the first place. The actual end result is also far from satisfying and the movie is a pretty bad one, in many different ways.The concept was already quite bad but so is the actual story. They make no secret out of it that the story got very much based on the Alien-legacy movies. Not just with the story but also with the characters really. Of course they also tried to spice up things and update the Friday the 13th series by adding new hip teen stuff. This however works more out lame then good for the movie really because everything in the movie seems so far fetched and the events and characters in it all feel very distant.There of course had been some bad Friday the 13th movies before in the series but what they all had in common was that they got better as they progressed. This movie however only gets worse as it progresses. The story becomes more and more ridicules, which really causes you to laugh more often than to be scared or grabbed by any of it.The movie is all about blood and gore and with this it also relies obviously on some special effects. As an horror movie the movie really falls flat, also due to the fact that it's more busy trying to be a science-fiction flick. Attempts that are in vein though, fore ""Jason X"" as a science-fiction movie also really falls short, not just due to the fact that it is hardly being original but also due to its looks. The futuristic clothes, the technologies, it's just all being too lame. Also the actual special effects are being slightly below par for normal 2001 standards.The movie also really makes the mistake that it allows the Jason character to be the true star of the movie. This means that he gets featured a lot, which makes everything less scary and takes away a lot of the tension of the movie. They even throw in lots of close-ups of him and especially his eyes. Jason is not as much a threatening character when you see his eyes really. The fact that Kane Hodder is again playing Jason can't even seem to safe the character this time and I'm not even talking yet about the Uber-Jason character that pops up in the movie.The movie really feels like a pointless sequel, also because it has so little to do with the rest of the Friday the 13th-series. They should had just skipped this movie and have started working on ""Freddy vs. Jason"" right away, since that was the movie everybody was anticipating for after ""Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday"". This movie seems to completely ignore the fact that ""Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday"" ever happened and it also really isn't staying very loyal to earlier movies within the series, as it's trying to really be a movie on its own that is made to appeal a new, younger audience. A failed attempt though.Really the worst that the Friday the 13th-series has to offer.4/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Jason X

Just as he's about to be frozen, David Cronenberg shows up to take him away, and he and his people are killed by you-know-who(he uses a magically appearing machete). Rowan, a scientist, traps him in a cryogenic chamber that evidently allows both of them(she's put to sleep too) to move after they shouldn't be able to. Years pass, somehow with no one stopping to check on this area, and Earth dies... yet the power remains on. We're about ten minutes in, people. I've already lost count of the plot holes. Anyway, he's brought onto a ship centuries later, and goes on the largest murder spree(there is no stalking in this, though a portion or two has him viciously attack without us knowing exactly where he is at first) of any of these, with an excessive amount of characters(most of whom are easily forgotten, and a few of whom are obnoxious) so that you will not be able to remember everyone(even not-Tony Todd and female Data), to ensure that many can be wasted. This has great FX and is filmed and edited quite nicely. It's too bad that nothing has an impact. We don't care about anyone and the futuristic sci-fi action setting takes a lot of the power of the untimely demise of anyone(can't everyone just use that nano-thing to heal?). With that said, they do get cool, unique death scenes out of where and when we are... in fact, the majority of them are creative and memorable. This is a bit like a low-rent remake of Alien(with a bit of Cameron's sequel thrown in for good measure) with Mr. X in place of H.R. Giger's infamous creature. The designs are nice. Dialog is poor, as is acting. This is never funny, in spite of countless attempts. There are points in this where you have no idea where people are in relation to one another. This is 84 minutes long sans credits. The DVD comes with an interesting and occasionally amusing commentary track by the director, writer and producer, two featurettes that I will review on their individual pages here on the site, Jump to a Death and a theatrical trailer. There is a lot of violence, blood and gore, and a little sex and nudity in this. I recommend this to fast-food type fans(if you want a fix, nothing that lasts) of slasher flicks and this franchise. 5/10",Jason X
20,view_and_review,Uber Jason,5,6 February 2021,"""Jason X"" is eight years removed from ""The Final Friday"" in which Jason supposedly went to hell. I guess he was just visiting. The ""Friday the 13th"" series jumped the shark ages ago, so nothing in this movie surprised me. They'd long since dispensed with the notion of Jason being human, so why shouldn't he be alive in the year 2455?The movie actually starts in the year 2010 in a facility of some sort where Jason is slated to be cryogenically frozen until a time in which mankind can figure out a way to kill him. He was frozen, but not before adding a few more bodies to his kill count.Over 400 years later he gets discovered and unfrozen whereby he picks up killing again.The premise is quite ridiculous, but at this point I'm used to ridiculousness with Jason. It can't be any more ridiculous than him being brought back to life with a lightning bolt after being dug up from his grave as was done in part 6.""Jason X"" had some throwback moments in it such as the ""Crystal Lake Research Facility,"" a couple of notes of the ominous music, and some horny young adults. The bulk of the movie takes place on a spaceship, so there were no lakes to go skinny dipping in. Killing Jason was just as impossible as it had always been. It seems that even in the future there are no hand-held weapons that can stop him. He was shot countless times and impaled with a giant hook before an android used a high enough caliber weapon to take his limbs and his head off. That was just a temporary setback because he landed on a regeneration machine that turned itself on and began repairing him with nanobots. He killed a few more people and was killed by being hurled towards Earth 2 (Earth was uninhabitable) where he presumably burned up entering its atmosphere.""Jason X"" was wholly unnecessary except to make an even number of ten movies or just to say that Jason was active in the 80's, 90's, and 2000's. Final kill count was 21, not including the girl who killed herself trying to get away, or the unknown amount of people at Solaris docking station that the ship plowed through because Jason killed the pilot.",Jason X
21,neil-476,"Um, OK.....",5,25 April 2010,"I suppose the virtue of this movie is that it delivers exactly what you expect it to. And the downside is that it's pretty dumb. But then, so were the others.Maybe I'm not the best person to comment, because I find the whole Jason Vorhees saga irritating in that the killer is implacable, unstoppable and unmotivated, and therefore devoid of all credibility. Being killed by Jason makes as much sense, and carries as much emotional weight, as being run down by an avalanche.Accordingly, I can't get behind these movies at all - they simply become a cynical exercise in imaginative slaughter and guessing the order of victims, with no rhyme or reason about it.Oh well, the sci-fi setting in this one makes a change, Lexa Doig is pleasingly decorative, and the fact that the whole thing is considerably sillier than usual (which is saying something) might be considered a bonus.",Jason X
22,Uriah43,A Disappointing Addition to the Franchise,4,16 February 2021,"This film begins with a small group of scientists taking the body of ""Jason Voorhees"" (Kane Hodder) to a secret research laboratory in order to study his incredible ability to regenerate after having been shot, hung, electrocuted and drown so many times in the past. Although they initially intended on using this information to facilitate their research on cryogenics they are soon interrupted by a man named ""Dr. Wimmer"" (David Cronenberg) who arrives with an Army escort to take physical possession of Jason's body in order to conduct his own scientific experiments for military purposes. What nobody counts on, however, is Jason returning back to life during this process and subsequently killing almost everyone within the facility. It's at this time that the last remaining survivor by the name of ""Rowan"" (Lexa Doig) manages to trick him into entering a cryogenic chamber and freezes him in the process. Unfortunately, she is injured while doing so and inadvertently becomes frozen herself. The scene then shifts to 450 years later with some explorers finding these two bodies and taking them aboard their spacecraft for further study-and that's when the nightmare begins again. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a different type of ""Friday the 13th"" which had all kinds of possibilities. Unfortunately, although it started off reasonably well, I didn't care for the manner in which the horror was lessened in order to accommodate the science-fiction aspects of the film along with the action sequences taking priority over the suspense. I especially didn't care for the scenes involving the android named ""Kay-Em 14"" (Lisa Ryder) which seemed much too juvenile and ridiculous. Again, this film had potential but the director (James Issac) was obviously not up to the task and I have rated this picture accordingly.",Jason X

The ridiculous plot takes place in the future with the discovery of two frozen bodies. One is a female scientist and the other is Jason Voorhees who is responsible for murdering eight billion airheads. He will dismember many futuristic idiots aboard a spacecraft including a nasty bout with a female android that is beyond laughable. This is all very predictable right down to the total moron who attempts to reason with Jason only to have his insides double as wallpaper. Jason entraps two women in sleeping bags and beats one with the other. Director James Isaac hasn't improved since making another piece of sh*t called The Horror Show. Like that garbage, his films seem to celebrate the lowest common denominator of humanity. The production values are so pitiful that a third grade art student could not have done any worse. Dreadful acting from Lexa Doig, Lisa Ryder, Chuck Campbell, and Jonathan Potts. They join many others for nothing more than to become part of the celebrated body count.

24,kannibalcorpsegrinder,"Fun, entertaining and highly enjoyable",10,23 August 2012,"Retrieving a relic of Jason Voorhees frozen in time, a group of students studying in the future find themselves stalked through their space-station home by the reawakened killer and must use the technology of the time to stop him.This was an absolutely fantastic entry which was one of the more enjoyable and exciting entries in the series. The best part of this is the extremely high-impact action scenes, which generate the best times here, starting with the opening attack on the guards in the facility in rather fun fashion before the big chase that gets him frozen with her, while the retrieval and stowing him on-board gives this one some really good times along with the initial rampage through the ship resulting in a lot of cheesy goodness to come from having these scenes set in the futuristic landscape. The initial resurrection on the heating bed alongside the oblivious worker while the screwing couple signaling the true rebirth which spawns a brilliant, original death scene with the infamous face first into ice, then shattered on a counter-top along with the two soldiers playing a virtual reality game and don't know Jason isn't part of the game, then they allow Jason to kill them quite easily. The action is non-stop, and there are many impressive scenes with this one, as the inclusion of the soldiers allows for some incredibly fun times with a spectacular stalking scene in a cargo-bay that generates some fine deaths and great suspense as Jason uses a ton of creativity to his kills which allows the great shoot-outs with the soldiers as well to generate even more good times with this one. There are more, from the battle in the engineer's room to the numerous stalking in the lab where it gets some fun action and classic stalking scenes involved in here as well as getting the action requirements out very nicely. The gunfight in the corridor getting the cyborg into the proceedings on Jason is a standout, and Jason's continual sit-ups after being hit by the shotgun really makes the scene impressive. Also, the humor is here with a bit of subtle comedy here and there and a total tongue-in-cheek attitude, not just from the jokes but the goofy tone here with the look of Jason and Uber-Jason and his dealings throughout here. As well, the shift to outer space was a refreshing change of pace and a source of much needed originality here with all these changes giving this a rather unique change in appearance that suits the film's more Sci-Fi leanings perfectly. Coupled with a Jason that is absolutely menacing and scary and looks like he's having too much fun in the role and a few nice odes to the others in the series, there's not a lot wrong here. The biggest issue here comes from the apparent lack of logic here, most of which comes from the behavior of the characters. It's really hard to believe that Jason is fooled by a holographic representation of Crystal Lake that's not even a full-on trick with the edges exposed, yet he still takes time to destroy holographs of two women who look like they belonged in the first movie and allow the good guys to escape, which is the biggest example here. The plot line involving the idiotic professor who only wants to profit from Jason and his continuous assurance that Jason will get taken care of is quite lame, as well as the finale of Jason gets ridden like a surfboard as he's falling back to Earth. However, here the action tends to hide a lot of these issues and it's really not all that noticeable when they occur. All in all, it really only comes down to personal tolerance of the cheese to find any flaws here, since it's a lot of fun regardless.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Brief Nudity, and a short sex scene.",Jason X

In that both movies have really nothing to do with the previous films. Granted part five and six have problems with the story as Jason is said to have been cremated in five, but that is nothing compared to the fact these movies do not even try to acknowledge previous installments of this film, though I am kind of glad they ditched the whole body snatching thing from ""Jason Goes to Hell"". This film has an introduction that is sort of old school, but then it is super futuristic and all and you are introduced to people you want dead. Well I wanted them dead, I never before pulled for Jason so much. The entire movie is like this, when the cyborg fights Jason the first time I was a bit bummed, but I laughed the second time when Jason became Super Jason. So basically, nearly all the characters are annoying and you are stuck pulling for the dude who says nothing, to me not the best ingredient for a horror movie. The film though was trying to be a bit more corny than usual and a bit funny, but for the most part I did not like it. I did like the part where they used the holographic girls to try and slow Jason down and what he did, but most of the comedy was a miss. In the end I almost think they made this movie less to make a serious movie, and more just to get Jason back in the public eye for his match with Freddy. Freddy needed it less because he has more personality than does Jason. There are worse ways to spend ones time, but this is most certainly not the best way, thankfully they never put Jason on a submarine or back in time with the dinosaurs.",Jason X

He and another person are revived in the year 2455 by a professor and his students who are on a field trip from Earth Two to Earth One. Jason is unleashed on their spaceship and havoc ensues.This entry is like 1979's ""Alien"" except with Jason as the monster and a sense of humor. You'll also notice that it's a great departure for the series putting Jason in space in the future. Most Friday fans look down on 1993's ""Jason Goes to Hell"" and ""Jason X"" because the producers tried something new. It's obvious that they felt the series had become stale and formulaic with an incredible eight-installment run from 1980-1989. I felt ""Jason Goes to Hell"" had a refreshing concept (ripped off from 1987's ""The Hidden"") and a great intro & opening act, but the tone was distasteful and the flick eventually spiraled out of control with its cartoony quasi-horror gobbledygook; still, it featured a couple of the best women in the series (Agent Marcus and Deborah), which should be commended.I heard negative comments about ""Jason X"" over the years, but the first half is sci-fi at its best with some amusing elements thrown in for good measure. It's stunning how well the filmmakers handle the sci-fi aspects of the plot and F/X. The second half, unfortunately, becomes too cartoonish as Jason systematically annihilates most of the crew, particularly when he gets his new futuristic look, basically morphing into SuperJason (rolling my eyes).As usual, this installment features an impressive assortment of women, but it's only Kinsa (Melody Johnson) that I find appealing, except for the cameo of the campfire teen #1 at the end, played by the stunning Mika Ward. They should have included her in the main cast.To be expected in light of the spaceship plot, the film was shot mostly on sets (in Toronto) with a couple of outside sequences in Ontario.The film runs 91 minutes.GRADE: B-",Jason X

Some are good and couldn't be done without CGI, just look at the scene with the girls frozen face. Although Halloween did it before without CGI with the burned face of a nurse in boiling water.

Where do you go from there? Oh, yeah, you reboot the franchise in 2009. And other than that inevitable reboot, 'X' absolutely was the original series finish (despite two of the sequels labeled as ""final"" and not counting the spin off 'Freddy Vs. Jason.') 'X' does start off with a good idea: after finally being captured, studied and executed  well, unsuccessfully hung, shot, etc, that is  Jason is set to be frozen. Though a good idea opening, four main questions arise: why leave the mask on? Where did he find a machete? How could he possibly get that machete through a thick metal door (even if Jason had great strength, the machete would still buckle)? And why wait two years after capture to finally attempt an escape  remember he can simply teleport himself at will anywhere, so why the wait? If you can look past those questions, then you're in store for many more lunacies in the film: horrible special effects, lame humor, plot that utterly rips off of both 'Aliens' and 'Alien: Resurrection,' laughable finale and 445 years later (one character mistakenly says 455, which would've been accurate due to the movie probably was made in 2000, but it's set originally in 2010) and even though the technology has improved, humans seem maybe 4 steps behind today's time. Overall, not the worst 'Friday,' it does have some good action, including an android battle and one of the best series scenes involving their version of a holodeck, which sums up the entire franchise.

I hated it. For reasons I cannot explain, I decided to give it another go to see if my opinion had changed any at all. The short answer is: No - I still hate it. I'm a huge fan of the Friday the 13th series, but I cannot stomach Jason X. You might think that by taking Jason into space, you'd come up with some new, original ideas. Well, you'd be wrong. There's very little new in Jason X that we haven't seen before. The lack of imagination is staggering. And the few things that are new (like Uber Jason) are so ridiculous, it's insulting. Stupid characters played by bad actors, bottom-of-the-barrel special effects, a complete lack of tension or suspense - it's all so bad that my 2/10 rating feels generous. A few very random thoughts:Are there any lights on this spaceship? Why would you go looking for a hulking killer in the dark? Who could have imagined that female scientists in the future would dress like today's highschool girls? And who knew that scientists in 2455 would act just like over-sexed 1980s-era teenagers? The ""space marines"" are beyond useless. Here's an idea - why not split up while searching for Jason? It makes it easier for him to kill you one at a time.Like a lot of other people, I did enjoy the Holodeck scene.

Hey that was my first, well complete experience of the franchise before I went on to see 'Jason X' at cinema the week after. I liked it, and borrowed the rest of the films off a friend. The series isn't a masterpiece of cinema, but they remain entertaining.I hadn't watched 'X' since I last saw it at the cinemas, and seeing it again it was just as fun as I remembered it, although the smarting puns (with those self-referential one-liners before being dispatched in a thoughtlessly tacky script) they seem to spit out got a little too much. The manner of the humour seemed to share a common style with 'Jason Lives: Friday the 13th Part VI (1986)', with quite an amusingly clever gag involving a hologram trip back to Camp Crystal lake for early 80's goodness. Anyhow Jason leaves his traditional Camp Crystal setting (even though he's 'kinda' still in the area when the film opens) to receive the space treatment (being better than other entries including 'Critters 4', 'Leprechaun 4: In Space' and 'Hellrasier: Bloodline') and a revamp look to go with it. Was that a good choice? I don't know but it still delivered on creatively vicious violence and shocks, a beautifully disposable cast and healthy body count (plenty of meat for the slaughter) despite the change of environment and mechanisms. It's the same-old, same-old, but done with enough aplomb. Director Jason Isaac gives the film a metallic gleam and provides a rapid pace never letting the clock slow up. The special effects by Stephan DuPuis are above-par and the production design is polished. Mark Manfredini gives his score an updated touch that works with the new backdrop.The acting isn't anything to write home about; however they do fill nicely to their roles. The stunning Lexa Doig makes for a reliable central performance and David Cronenberg chips in with nifty cameo in opening scenes. Kane Hodder brings the right intensity to Jason, and has truly made it his own. Peter Mensah and Melyssa Ade were fun in their parts too.",Jason X

I mean it's basically 'Jason Voorhees in space' killing people. Yeah, like it must have taken the film-makers years to come up with that offshoot of the classic Friday 13th mythology.Do you really need to know how a psychotic undead serial killer gets up into space? You probably don't. He just does. It's not important. What is important is what he gets up to – which is killing people (like he hasn't done that before, huh?). Only this time it just seems like a lot more fun.It's as if the film-makers knew they were really stretching believability with this offering and decided to just have fun. The end result is a big, loud, kind of silly space-age romp. Think 'Alien,' but with dafter teenagers instead of Ripley, Kane and co (and an alien wearing a hockey mask).If you like serious films, or straight unflinching horror then you'll probably HATE this.

I think ""Friday The 13th"" has the most numbered sequels of anything in his book. It was weird looking up plots and finding out the villains died in the last movie. Every single one of them is back! It was bad enough that they lied to us with ""Friday The 13th Part IV: The Final Chapter"". Then they lied AGAIN with ""Jason Goes To Hell: The Final Friday"". It looks like this is still the last canonical appearance of Jason in this timeline, although they simply made a remake years later. It's weird how they attempted to make the formula different in the last couple of movies. It's a pity they were just as dumb as the originals, if not worse. Anyway, this film features Jason being frozen for hundreds of years and then terrorizing the people on a spaceship. It's weird to see how these supposedly genius scientists are every bit as stupid as the kids on Crystal Lake.They just get killed off over and over like the dumb teenagers hundreds of years ago. I guess you could argue Jason simply became more powerful, but still they should know better. I was amazed at how awful the CGI was in the training simulation. I guess that might have been intentional, seeing as how it was a simulation, but it still looked hideous. We even got to see these guys die twice. I'm glad I watched this on Friday the 13th even if it wasn't in the title. I saw it on the Syfy Channel and honestly, it fit right there with their cheesy movies. *1/2",Jason X
37,cricketbat,The same rehashed story but with ridiculous chrome plating,4,29 October 2020,"The whole Friday the 13th franchise is a joke, and Jason X seems to be in on that fact. However, it's still a bad movie. Putting Jason Voorhees in space may have seemed like a cool idea in the writing room, and the concept art probably looked cool, but this movie is just the same rehashed story we've seen nine times before, just with ridiculous chrome plating. I get why some people may like it, but I certainly don't.",Jason X
38,CuriosityKilledShawn,"Weird, neither good nor terrible",7,20 May 2004,"As weird as Jason in space may seem, his fans finally got what they asked for - something new - when, after four false starts, this movie was finally made. Four hundred and fifty five years in the future, earth is dead and the recently defrosted J-Man finds himself aboard the Grendel, a field-trip vessel carrying students from Earth 2. So, basically, Jason + teenagers = mass death. Something old and something new. Something borrowed, or nicked, are the best bits from the Alien movies. You know what's in store, long scenes of creeping around dark corridors before being carved up.What I don't get is the fact that the filmmakers knew that we didn't want Camp Crystal Lake AGAIN and so decided to take us as far away as possible from the previous nine movies. Why must they give us the ancient and decrepit stalk'n'slash scenario yet again? Fresh zazz, or zing, or fizz, or even pop could have been added. But no! It threatens to get very dull and the only thing that saves it are the gorgeous SFX, stronger production values and more determined than usual characters (slabs of meat).James Isaac has had plenty experience in the horror genre and, along with his cinematographer, has given this movie a far more sophisticated look than most other horror flicks. Lighting is provocative and the colour palette is well thought out and bright. It's a shame that nothing of real genius, or imagination, occurs within this unique environment.Plus, I'm getting real sick of Kane Hodder, as Jason. At first, I liked him - F13, Part VII, was his premier outing - but now he's changed the character too much. Instead of an evil, worm-infested zombie, with incredible strength, he's a massive brick shithouse, who moves slower than your average glacier. How can these kids not escape him? The acting, by a bunch of Canadian TV folk, is tolerable. None has enough skill to bring any real humour, or depth, to roles. Who cares when they die? The only interesting character is a female robot, or Fembot, as the Austin Powers movies put it, with no feelings - how ironic! There's no good excuse for Jason X being so average. Even the presence of Uber-Jason - Robocop, only not friendly - is too little too late, although he, along with Janessa's cleavage, doesn't get enough screen time.If you're having a beer blast, or a stein-hoist, then Jason X is worth the rental. If you're after classical entertainment then...probably not.",Jason X
39,jack_o_hasanov_imdb,Space ?,3,28 August 2021,"Jason has always been fun to watch. The films of the series deteriorated over time. This movie is the worst. I didn't enjoy it, it was boring. It wasn't a good idea.",Jason X
40,Bored_Dragon,- What's his condition? - He's screwed. :D,7,18 August 2018,"The sequels often fail to maintain the level of the original. Franchisees tend to go downhill, and the third or fourth part is rarely worth watching, and hardly anyone dares to go even further than that. When I decided to watch ""Friday the 13th"" I was in for a surprise. The franchise that was mediocre to begin with somehow pushed through eleven movies and it even gets better towards the end. To be understood, this is far from a good movie, but in relation to the first eight, the ninth is obvious progress, and the tenth is a masterpiece. The end of ""Jason Goes to Hell"" clearly announced the appearance of Freddy Krueger in the next sequel, but between it and ""Freddy vs. Jason"" they unexpectedly inserted space episode ""Jason X"". This film completely ignores the fact that Jason should be in Hell and begin its story totally unrelated to its predecessors. The story is placed on a spaceship and obviously inspired by the ""Alien"", and there are also elements of ""Matrix"" and Lara Croft (or maybe it is an allusion to ""Resident Evil""). Characters are stupid as usual, and instead of sticking together to wait for Jason, they once again separate and let him kill them one by one. But, to be honest, if they were smart there would be very little material for a horror movie. The girls are again beautiful, but this time they are dressed all the time. The film maintains a very fast pace and tense atmosphere from beginning to end, and even if doesn't keep you on the edge of the chair, you certainly will not be bored. For me, this is the most suspenseful part of the franchise and I would probably slip out of the chair if there was no occasional humorous scenes and totally crazy killings, which, especially combined, for a moment create comic reliefs.Look at that. - A shooting star. :D7/10",Jason X

Friday the 13th final chapter is also scarier. Friday the 13th VI Jason lives is also scarier. Friday the 13th VII the new blood is also scarier. Friday the 13th VIII Jason take Manhattan is also scarier. Jason goes to hell the final Friday is also scarier. Still this is a very scary movie. It is scarier then Friday the 13th (1980). It is also scarier then Friday the 13th II. It is also scarier then Friday the 13th V a new beginning. This is a great movie. It has great acting. It also has a great story line. It also has great special effects. This movie a must see. Jason is a zombie so I consider this horror fantasy. And this movie take place in space in the future. This is the only Friday the 13th movie that does. Freddy vs Jason is a prequel to this movie. Freddy is a ghost. Both of these character get kill of and come back more then three time. See this movie. It is a get movie. I knew people like this movie it the ratting it got 5 out of 10. People who like this movie need to speak up.

42,tomgillespie2002,"When the title is a film's cleverest attribute, you know it's in trouble",2,17 October 2015,"With Freddy Vs. Jason still stuck in development hell, Friday the 13th producer and creator Sean S. Cunningham wanted to ensure that audiences didn't forget about the monster in the hockey mask and gave us a tenth entry, coming 8 years after the previous film. With the last two instalments attempting to change the formula (getting him out of Camp Crystal Lake and then turning him into a body- jumping ghoul from Hell) and becoming two of the most hated entries into the franchise in the process, Jason X faced a battle to bring the well-worn slasher genre to a modern audience. Well, all gore- seeking teenagers love space, right?When the title is a film's cleverest attribute, you know it's in trouble. In the near-future, Jason Voorhees (Kane Hodder) is imprisoned in Camp Crystal Lake's research facility, where a bunch of silly scientists (including David Cronenberg) look to transport him to another location in order to carry out further research. Naturally, Jason breaks free and kills everyone, just before being frozen along with the sexy doctor Rowan (Lexa Doig). They are discovered almost 500 years later by a group of explorers from Earth II, who take the two corpses aboard their ship, bringing Rowan back to life using advanced science. With Jason now established as a supernatural being who cannot be killed, he is soon alive and kicking and butchering the annoying crew one by one.With the post-modern horror boom still in full swing thanks to Scream (1997), Jason X plays mainly for laughs. Clearly made with the series' fans in mind, it features various winks at the audience and just may have worked had the script, actors and production values been anything other than abominable. Bad special effects can have its charms, but Jason X looks like a mid-shelf TV show most of the time, with the only inspired effect coming from a poor female doctor who has her face frozen with liquid nitrogen and then smashed to pieces on a work surface (one of the best Jason killings in the entire franchise). Rather than being funny, it feels symbolic of what a parody of itself the series has become. The fans will surely disagree, but the Friday the 13th films have never been good, and Jason X is the poorest of them all. It may not tell us how to kill Jason once and for all, but it demonstrates how to kill a franchise.",Jason X

This Jason movie however is actually well written and has a bigger budget with some good effects. The battle between Jason and the android was neat. When Jason became Uber-Jason that was really good but near the end when the guy is trying to fool jason in the Crystal Lake area was believe it or not to ME was funny. I thought is was funny because the girls were stupid going in those sleeping bags and what happen? Jason picked them bags ups and banged them against the trees repeatedly untill they were dead.

As supernatural as he is, Jason(Kane Hodder) is the ultimate killer. Now that he's in the future, he's no longer a threat to Camp Crystal Lake, otherwise it was foolish to revive him in the future.

The unsuspecting (in the beginning) occupants of the space ship gets hacked and maimed in the usual way you'd expect from Friday the 13th movie, but this one is bit more imaginative because there are more props of the future that can be used to add gory ways people get snuffed by our antihero.For a relatively low budget movie, the special effects are surprisingly good. The actors are all good looking which adds to the quality of the story.Out of all the Friday the 13th movie (so far), this one is my favorite for the action and the visuals this movie has to offer.

This movie is directed by James Issac (Pig Hunt) and stars David Cronenberg (yes, the director), Peter Mensah (300 and Spartacus), Lexa Doig (Andromeda) and Markus Parilo (Fargo). The storyline for this isn't that great and reminded me of a made for television film in terms of the special effects, especially the outer space scenes. I did like the virtual reality game components, and the old hockey mask in space scenes and references, but there isn't much memorable here outside space being the primary setting. Well, Jason did have the scene where he dry iced her face and smashed her head on the sink...that was cool. Overall, I'd say this is better than Jason Goes to Hell, but still nothing special overall.

Once Rowan (Lexa Doig), leader of the research project, prepares the specimen for cryogenic suspension, a greedy scientist goes over her head and comes to remove Jason, only to have the mad slasher break free and slaughter him and his entire entourage. Tricking Jason into following her, Rowan eludes him into entering the cryogenic freezer and begins the process, but a breach in the system causes her to freeze with him. The government tries to deny any evidence of the project, and nearly four centuries pass, during which the Earth gradually becomes less and less habitable and humans have relocated to a planet in another star system that they've named Earth II. A team of young students descends onto the ruined Earth, where they find the frozen bodies of Jason and Rowan in the forgotten research facility and take back on board their ship with them. Rowan is thawed and revived, but the team mistakes Jason to be dead, having no idea of his abilities or motives. Before long, Jason awakens to the sound of young people having premarital sex once again, and the carnage erupts once again as the ship proceeds to Earth II.

Or her body double, anyway. Then you had Hellraiser IV: Bloodline, which ended with trapping Pinhead in a dimension where he could only phone it in for direct to DVD sequels. That was followed by ""Leprechaun in Space"", a movie where I think halfway through, they decided, ""Let's make this a farce, no one is taking this seriously, why should we?"" The idea is you put the monster in space, and watch him reenact the alien movies.Well, sadly, this was the end they intended to put poor Jason to. They had him get cryogenically frozen and then resurrected on a spaceship, along with Lexa Doig of Andromeda fame. (In a role reversal,Andromeda co-star Lisa Ryder plays an android, and a better one than Doig played on the series. Probably didn't do the casting right.) Of course, Jason comes back from the dead, and starts picking off horny undergrads and space marines.

Following in the hallowed footsteps of Leprechaun 4, Hellraiser: Bloodline and Critters 4, this installment finds Jason cryogenically frozen for four hundred years and defrosted aboard a lightly-staffed spacecraft. No explanation is offered for his abrupt return from the depths of the nether, where he was unceremoniously dumped at the end of Jason Goes to Hell, though I'm not sure that really would've made a difference. This is a willfully stupid playground for half-baked science fiction ideas, terrible wardrobe choices and budget special effects; a cut-rate production that would feel right at home on the Sci-Fi Channel at 3am. Predictable to the end, it touches all the bases with gratuitous nudity, shallow characters, mysterious returns from certain doom and a truckload of dismemberments / decapitations / deaths. The only thing we're missing is the trademarked screeching cat fake-out, presumably because no self-respecting animal would be seen in such a production. Apart from one fleeting moment of self-deprecating parody near the end - which is totally out of place, but admittedly had me howling - there's no reason for this to exist. It's the kind of thing that would've thrived on the bootleg circuit, akin to Roger Corman's unreleased Fantastic Four, but by actually sending it to theaters, New Line took the wind out of those sails.

This time, it's 25th century and earth is no longer an inhabitable place for the human race. So, a group of people on a spaceship receive two cryogenically frozen bodies. After unthawing the frozen beings, one of them turns out to be the legendary killer Jason Voorhees. And of course, unfreezing him has brought old Jason back to life. After killing off a whole investigation crew, Jason begins a rampage among the giant spacecraft, killing off anyone and everyone who even comes close to crossing his deadly path.While this movie is fairly enjoyable, the entire idea of ""Jason in space"" doesn't sit well with me. Why bring one of cinema's most legendary murderers into outer space, the idea is a bit ridiculous if you ask me. Despite this major flaw, ""Jason X"" is a pretty fun little horror movie. The story - while it is just a little unbelievable - works on most levels. The whole space-age atmosphere to the film was interesting, so any sci-fi fans can relate a little (unfortuantely I'm not one of them). The cast was mostly a bunch of no-name actors, but they all give fairly good performances, keeping in mind this is a Friday the 13th sequel (and the tenth one, might I add). There was one really well-thought up killing in the film that I thought was extremely unique and clever. I won't say anything to give it away, but I'm sure that you'll know what it is when you see it, I thought it was pretty cool.Overall, ""Jason X"" is a campy horror movie. While the special effects and acting are decent, the whole premise of the movie is pretty silly. If you don't take the film too seriously, you may find it to be enjoyable.

Lexa Doig is good here, and I was surprisingly impressed by her performance. Now the professor in this movie was really annoying and I actually just hated him, like seriously his character was just crap. Kay Em was an awesome character and I enjoyed her presence. Well Jason Voorhees definitely put up a pretty damn good fight, and that is part of what made the movie entertaining. Yes, there were some lines of dialogue that were just pretty stupid and I wish I had not been there, lifelike don't rip my pants, I don't know if they were trying to add comedic relief, but if they were then it just didn't work. Ya know I actually thought I was going to absolutely hate this movie but I just couldn't. Parts of it were just too entertaining to hate.

63,JoeKarlosi,Jason X (2000) **,5,28 October 2012,"The last of the original ""Friday the 13th"" series, and the least. Jason is put into deep freeze sometime in the 21st Century, but gets thawed out as a scientific curiosity during a student field trip aboard a spacecraft in the far off future. Kane Hodder returns for his fourth and final go-round as Jason and is his usual dependable self. The idea of featuring ""Jase In Space"" sounds absurd at first, but it works within the movie because despite his surroundings, Jason himself still remains rooted in his mindless and indiscriminating killing persona; this time he just happens to be a victim trapped in a world beyond his understanding or control. However, what really weakens this one substantially for me is that there are too many dumb jokes, and these teenagers who are supposed to be from the year 2455 still look, act, and spout dopey colloquialisms exactly like today's dopey teenagers. The writing and dialogue in particular could have been much better. A few highlights include the ""liquid nitrogen face death"" (one of the top kills in Jason history) and the humorous ""virtual reality sequences"". At least the ending devised an interesting way to eliminate Jason once and for all. ** out of ****",Jason X
64,I_Ailurophile,The best 'Friday the 13th' movie,9,13 January 2021,"Surprise! ""Jason In Space"" is a horror-comedy!I tend to greatly enjoy movies that know exactly what they are and make no apologies for it. I regard 'Jason X' much the same way I do 'Godzilla: Final Wars' or 'Escape from L.A.'-the writers clearly wink or nod at the audience as though to say, ""Yep. This is what we're doing."" If that's not the sort of film for you, I understand, but you're missing out on a fun, wild ride as everything possible is thrown in just for kicks.Everything is very deliberately over the top: effects, sets, costumes, make-up, to say nothing of the plot. Dialogue is at turns boneheaded and drily witty, complementing deaths that are alternately brutal and cartoonish (or why not both?). The actors here are all having a great time, putting in the most convincing performances they can in a film that does not require it. It's hard not to imagine that every day on set was more fun than work.While the whole affair is played very seriously, there's no fright to be had here, only thrills and laughs. I can appreciate that such a sudden turn for a reputed slasher franchise may be off-putting. Yet it's not terribly often that a horror film (albeit a horror-comedy) can upend expectations like this, and moreover, 'Jason X' crafts a uniquely different film that manages to arguably be more true to itself than its predecessors could muster.It's hard to miss the generally poor reception for this movie. Usually I'd remark that would-be viewers clearly weren't in the target audience, but that's not true: it's more that the target audience didn't know they were targets of a joke.Drop your expectations for what you think 'Friday the 13th' should be. Sit back, relax, and enjoy what is one of the most fun movies I think I've ever seen.",Jason X
65,dworldeater,At least Jason X tried to do something different,5,7 March 2021,"I must confess that I am not really a fan of the Friday The 13th series. As a teenager, I saw most of the sequels on HBO and could tell little difference between them. So taking a cryogenically frozen Jason and putting him 400 years in the future in outer space is not the worst idea out there. I actually thought that could be a good premise to a tired franchise. Jason X has a lot of problems and is a mixed bag that ultimately is guilty pleasure viewing. I do enjoy this for a laugh, but it could have been legitimately good if it was taken more seriously. The writing, dialogue and acting is really bad, with a mostly clueless young cast that could have been on Dawson's Creek or something. It does what most science fiction does and rips off Star Trek. The tone is really silly and tongue in cheek. However, Kane Hodder is as great here as our hero Jason and he is as menacing as ever. The money from the film obviously went into special f/x and cinematography. Jason X really looks great, but with a flimsy plot and goofy acting the film falls flat on it's face. But if that was tightened up, Jason X could have gone the distance. That having been said, I enjoy Jason X and Freddy Vs Jason much better than the other films in the series.",Jason X
66,aidanratesmovies,The film feels like it was made by a horny teenage nerd...but that doesn't mean it isn't fun to watch,5,17 November 2020,"Silly, juvenile, but admittedly fun- Jason X never really decides whether it wants to be a parody or actually take it seriously, but there is some entertaining moments along the way. First thing first, I don't like this movie, and there are certainly quite a few reasons why. First off, the majority of the acting is pretty horrible, with Lisa Ryder being the only halfway decent actress throughout the whole film. The set looks cheaply made, like a bunch of rejected sets of an early 2000's sci-fi film that was never made. The CGI can be quite obvious at times, although it isn't horrible, despite it sticking out so much. Some of the dialogue is super ridiculous, and in general the film is poorly written with some things clearly showing this film was made in 2001 and not 4 centuries in the future. Despite all that though, this film is surprisingly fun to watch, and is quite possibly one of the most entertaining entries in the franchise as a whole. Its kills can be fun from time to time, its setting and technology somewhat interesting, and its goofy antics are obviously stupid, but quite enjoyable to see play out on screen. In the end, Jason X was not nearly as bad as I thought it may be, although it certainly isn't in any way a good film. Maybe its unneeded, maybe its dumb and childish, but it certainly isn't the worst film ever made, nor the worst in the franchise.My Rating: 4.8/10.",Jason X
67,caspian1978,There is No Where Else to Go!,5,20 October 2004,"Where else is Jason going to go? He's been to New York City....where else is there? Even though Jason returns to face Freddy, this should be the last we see of Jason. Unless Jason decided to attack martians on Mars, Jason has been there and done that. A nice science fiction / horror movie that fails on all levels, the gore hardly keeps the audience interested in seeing what happens. A typical horror cast that does nothing for the film. The human race has not evolved much since Jason began killing horny teenagers on Crystal Lake. In the future, teenagers are still horny and are vulnerable to psycho's named Jason. One of the worst of the 10, many felt Tom Savini should have directed this one. Instead, we hopefully close the book on Jason after an impressive 21 year run. Jason is due to retire. Thank God!",Jason X
68,Agent10,Pick Your poison,4,28 April 2002,"Wow! Talk about your piece of garbage. I haven't been this entertained in so long, I might have busted my sides. Obviously, this film was made to satirize itself. Or was it?Bad acting, funky lighting and ridiculous dialogue really create quite a quandary: Is it good because it's so bad or is it too good to be considered terrible?I've decided to label this film a piece of brilliant stupidity. Most idiotic films try to hard to make themselves legitimate, but Jason X simply throws all of those thoughts out the window. This may be the best sequel in the series, which isn't saying much, but then again, what does one expect from a film series with 10 remakes of itself. I will say this,it will be a hell of a lot better than Halloween Resurrection.If you've seen the trailer for it, this film takes itselfway too seriously. For crying out loud, how many times can Michael Myers come back in a serious and scary fashion? The producing team for Halloween should take notes from Jason X: you've made far too many sequels up to this point, so you might as well have a little fun with it.I will also say this: David Cronenberg's cameo performance was pretty cool, and Lexa Doig was ravishing.",Jason X

If you're asking me if this movie is entertaining, then my answer is absolutely; it's one of the more entertaining movies I've seen this year. This movie doesn't succeed in being scary, nor does it do anything to advance Jason's overall storyline (I'm pretty sure most people wouldn't consider this cannon), but there are plenty of gory, sometimes hysterical, kills that fill this film's meager runtime.

71,Movie-ManDan,Back to Good-Old Killer-Fun!,6,9 November 2017,"After the abysmal ""Jason Goes to Hell,"" anything seemed better. And why not make a movie so the amount of instalments is an even 10? Luckily, this goes back to same non-serious fun Jason films of previous instalments. And after watching the previous Jason movie, it really elevated Jason X.After being sent to hell in ""Jason Goes To Hell,"" Freddy obviously resurrects him and his body-count in growing. It is the mid 2000s and Jason has been captured and cryogenically frozen. They freeze him because they can't figure out a way to destroy him forever. Only the supernatural can do it! But Jason's brutish strength messes things up and he gets frozen with one of the researchers. Fast forward 450 years. A group of college students are travelling on a spaceship and stumble upon Jason and the girl. Both are thawed and then the movie turns into Alien with Jason as the monster. When we get to see the students and their professor, its pretty silly. Good for laughs. When Jason awakens and tries to destroy all, we actually become invested. When Jason gets upgraded into the most powerful he could ever be, it's pretty kick-ass.In the year 2455, some of the futuristic things we see is pretty cool. And a spaceship is cool to see in general. And add one of cinema's coolest monsters to wreck havoc. The way all this is added up makes the movie totally bad-ass. Sure the acting is dull and its not very smart, but the fights and Uber Jason are all so fun!I gave some earlier instalments thumbs up just because they were fun and they didn't demand to be taken seriously. Jason X is one of those.3/4",Jason X
72,rosscinema,"Freddy, your next!",2,4 May 2003,"The first film came out in 1980 and here I am in 2003 watching the newest Jason film! And to top it off, the next one has been made and it has Freddy in it! About the only positive thing that I can say about this series is that it stopped taking itself seriously a long time ago. This film starts out with Jason hanging in chains and of course he busts out. A female scientist named Rowan (Lexia Doig) locks Jason in a cryogenic chamber and freezes him. But they're is a leak and she gets frozen as well. Now zoom up 400 years and some crew on a space ship find them and take them on board. Let the thawing begin! Most of the actors in this film look no older than 25. And most of them look like models. At one point in the film a very hot female is suppose to be a scientist examining Jasons tissue and she wears a belly shirt. In fact, most of the hot chicks on board wear belly shirts. All the characters in this film act just as dumb and irrational as the characters in the original 1980 film. So much for progress! One of the more appealing characters is a female robot (Hot looking of course) named Kay-EM14 (Lisa Ryder) and she gets horny like everyone else but Ryder seems to be having fun playing it. As far as sequels go you know one of the last resorts is to put the story in outer space. Remember ""Highlander II"" and the last ""Hellraiser"" film? Well, they're going to have to resurrect him somehow for his battle with Freddy. For you trivia nuts, David Cronenberg makes a cameo and Cronenberg regular Robert Silverman has one scene as well.",Jason X
73,raulfaust,Good movie,8,7 December 2010,"I don't understand how you guys can find this movie predictable and boring. The deaths were such creative, the scenario was very innovator and the acting was good. How can it be the worst thriller ever? The only bad thing for me is that they took too long to finish the movie. They could have avoided some comes and goes about the spacecraft's security which was unnecessary, but the non-clichéd ending made up for this. Am I the only one who didn't find plot holes in here? I mean, it's extremely hard to find a horror movie without lots of them, and this movie surprisingly avoided it.I could notice a criticism to the capitalism system, accusing it of putting money above people. It also reminded me of ""The Cube(1996)"", even though their criticism was about job's alienation. A good watch for horror fans, and I hope watching good movies like that in future.",Jason X

75,lemon_magic,"""I think he's gone."" ""Why don't you stick your head out there and find out??""",5,3 September 2005,"First of all, I don't quite understand the 'hate' for this tenth installment of the Friday/Jason series. It's ""Friday the 13th"", for crying out loud! ANY change in the direction of the series is welcome at this point. It seems as if the fans have forgotten how 'winded' the Jason series had become - after the absolute dregs of the series in ""Jason Goes To Hell"", ""Jason Takes Manhattan"" and ""The New Breed"", the series' creators were not just beating a dead horse, they were dragging it around the track behind a tractor. ""Jason X"" at least tries to give the horse a jolt with the defibrillator. In spite of the 2nd rate effects, and general silliness, the 10th film in the series has visual energy and freshness that has been missing for at least a decade. The characters are all stereotypes, but they are GOOD stereotypes in new, snazzy 'futuristic' costumes, and they get to use snazzy new assault rifles and hologram projectors and stuff to fight back. It doesn't work of course, and Jason still kicks everybody's butt, but the change in atmosphere and sets does rescue the film from the tedious dread of previous installments. There is some actual levity and some winking tribute to some of the classic conventions of earlier films (such as when Jason beats one camper to death with another one, but it's OK because they are holograms). And Jason gets a 'new look' in the middle of the film. It doesn't really add that much to the character, but again, at least it is different enough to help you 'see' the character again after decades of over-familiarity. I rented this DVD fully expecting it to suck, but to my surprise, the opening scenes and the way the premise was set up caught my bemused interest, and the SFX of the future were JUST good enough to entertain my eyes. And eventually I ended up enjoying the proceedings quite a bit. Not nearly as much as a 'real' movie, of course, but much more than I ever expected from ""Friday the 13th"" ever again. I'd say it is the only really watchable entry in the series in several years, and if there are no more after this (and I hope not), ""Jason X"" is not a bad way for FXIII to end.",Jason X
76,Rob_Taylor,It's a good film to sit down in front of and switch off your brain for a bit.,6,19 December 2002,"There have been a lot of negative comments about this film, but honestly, what do people expect of a tenth installment? The Jason Vorhees movies continue not because they're good, but because they are a tried and tested formula - blood, mayhem and gore. There's no deep meaning here. It's just more of the same.If you go into this movie expecting anything other than silliness and blood-splattering, you'll hate it. On the other hand if, like me, you expected it to be diabolically bad, then you'll be pleasantly surprised.Of course it's throw-away rubbish, but it knows it's crap, and pokes fun at itself. And for that reason it's a good film to sit down in front of and switch off your brain for a bit and have a laugh.Apart from the original movie I can only recall seeing part of one of the intervening series of films - some nonsense with Jason on a boat. So I can't comment on whether it's better or worse than the others. Even my memory of the original is hazy now. But this episode is not too bad.The best bit is the android girl who gets ""reprogrammed"" by her creator/would-be-lover into a killing machine. Up to that point she was mildly uninteresting, as all the characters are. After that, I was rooting for her the rest of the film. The others are fairly bland and die in an assortment of ways, some more amusing than others.There's some hokum about how Jason keeps going and why he regenerates etc. but it's just added fluff to the carnage. There's also the obligatory sexual scene, but it's tame and light.Not very good, but for a tenth movie of a franchise, it holds up quite well.",Jason X
77,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,Apollo the 13th,6,21 October 2013,"or: Jason X, People 0.After being cryogenically frozen for half a millennium, the unhappiest camper of all time is transported via space station to Earth 2 (the sequel?) and accidentally thawed out. He begins hacking and slashing his way through a group of less obnoxious nitwits on board the space station in deep space.Uneven structure, the film is basically two acts: the first last about 20 minutes, and sets up Jason being frozen and thawed. Then the second act has him slaughtering a commando unit, and various other people on board this space station, for the remainder of the film's run time. Film never really climaxes, it just stops in a way which the filmmakers incorrectly think is clever and humorous.A definite improvement over the previous film, Jason goes to Hell, but there are absolutely no scares. Technically well made, this is mostly a science fiction/ comedy, as the film is set on board a space station and the majority of the dialogue is one-liners. Jason makeup has been toned down considerably: no longer is he a rotting, walking corpse; here, he appears to be just a guy in a hockey mask. But that works for this movie, for some reason. I kind of liked it that way for a change. The characters are fairly dim, as always, but not as repulsive as in a couple other installments of this series. Lexa Doig, Kane Hodder, and Peter Mensah do surprisingly well with their characters and the material, which is the biggest asset for this movie.Filmed in March and April 2000, released in Germany in July 2001, Spain in November 2001, South America in January and February 2002, Stateside and the rest of the world did get it until at least the spring of 2002, giving this film probably the oddest, longest delayed release in the series' history.",Jason X

There's a strong sense of parody and a sense of humor in the advertising campaigns, but this doesn't really kick in until about the last third of the movie. Before then it's pretty much bog-standard ""generic horror flick"" with some minimal nods to the updated science-fiction setting. Once the creators start having a little fun with the s.f. elements, and the KM unit gets upgraded into your typical ""leather clad dominatrix/fighter"" persona from most video games,  things start to kick in a bit. Not surprisingly, Lisa Ryder as KM is about the only person who seems to be having any fun with her part.  The virtual Crystal Lake is also a good idea, although tossed away way too quickly. The ending is also kinda cute in a circular/self-parody kinda way. Unfortunately, it's pretty boring for the first two-thirds, and the audience I was with didn't laugh once at any of the funny stuff in the early stuff. Overall, not too good and probably should have gone with direct-to-video.",Jason X

I find the idea of the indestructible boogeyman a stupid one. By the time the 3rd sequel came around (the 3D one), I went to see these for two reasons: Nudity and Killings. When the censors started cutting the gore out - I stopped paying attention at all. Jason X is the best of the later sequels. It has an interesting idea, Jason waking up in the future, and a cast that can actually act and that the audience can actually root for. Jason is as menacing as ever (honestly, I could have used more gore, a lynchpin of the originals), and it's quick and fun. Just grab some popcorn and, as usual, turn off your brain.",Jason X

And I especially don't understand how so many people actually really enjoy it or find it ""entertaining."" I really just don't get the appeal of it at all, nor can I really figure out what it hopes to accomplish.It's a film that aspires to be so much more than it is, but it never lives up to even a hint of what it promises. It's a contradictory film from scene to scene. On one hand, it fancies itself a subversive satire along the lines of ""Jason Lives"", yet it only delivers the occasional jest at its own expense. On the other hand, if often plays the material straight for attempts at honest thrills, yet these are contradictory to its lighter moments. It occasionally gets the idea that it's an effects spectacle on the rare occasion for more complex sequences, but it's hindered by a low budget. Yet it also frequently seems aware of its cheap cost in other scenes.It's like watching someone trying desperately to put together two different jigsaw puzzles after the pieces have become inadvertently mixed together. Nothing fits.We all know the plot... It's ""Friday the 13th"" in space. Jason gets cryogenically frozen (along with sexy scientist Rowan, portrayed by Lexa Doig) in modern times, only to be awakened on a spaceship 400 years later, so he can hack up stupid, nubile teens... in the future!Blah, blah, blah. He kills a few, gets blown apart by a sexy android chick (Lisa Ryder), gets brought back with magical future medical-technology as a half-robotic ""Uber Jason"", and chaos ensues. (That was all in the trailer, so there's no spoilers there.) It's a rinse and repeat of almost every previous film, except now Jason gets a hokey new metallic costume and there's a lot of bad CGI and green-screen effects because, you know... the future! And space!To be fair and give credit where it is due, there's a few positive aspects here. Lisa Ryder steals the show as robotic ""KM-14"" in a delightful little role. There's also some fun to be had with a few high-concept gags like a laugh-out-loud holographic simulation of Crystal Lake in the 80's. And I'd be lying if I said there weren't a few creative kills. (Cryo-freezing someone's face and then smashing it? Yes, please!) There's also a cameo from filmmaking god David Cronenberg, who chews the scenery in a fun-albeit-brief role! (How did they even get him for this movie?! Is he a big Jason fan?)But the film never comes together as I said. I can't help but feel screenwriter Todd Farmer was aiming at something a lot bigger and more bombastic, but kept having to be dialed back by studio-suits and producers over budgetary concerns. A lot of the scenes and plot lines come across as last-minute back-ups that were thrown in in case the studio couldn't afford the intended sequences.The tragedy is that it had a golden opportunity to do so much more. The ""Killer in Space"" trope is such a widely-known cliché, that putting more effort into subverting and parodying the concept would have given the film a fresher, more unique flavor. It needed to drop its more serious moments and take full advantage of delivering self-aware laughs based around its setting and location. The few times it tries, it works. But it doesn't take enough advantage of this... it's not commenting on the silly ""killer in space"" trope. It's just another example of it being done poorly, while giving us an occasional fleeting wink and nod.Even beyond the failed potential, there's just a whole lot of nothing going on. The effects budget eats up too much money, so everything else- sets, costume design, etc. look cheap and fake. Director James Isaac seems in over his head, and only delivers a minimum effort in his visuals. Series composer Harry Manfredini- usually a reliable musician in his own right- barely seems to try with a really bad and often artificial-sounding synth soundtrack. And supporting roles are among the series worst, with grating characters being portrayed by dime-a-dozen ""pretty face"" actors who would be more at home on Hollister billboards than on-screen. (Shelly from Part III and Megan from Part VI still remain the high point of supporting roles even to this day.)So sadly, ""Jason X"" emerges as one of the weakest films in the series in my opinion. It may think it's something grander than it is, but we as an audience can see that this just isn't the case.It's a 2 out of 10 just for it's few fun moments. But they aren't worth having to slog through 90 minutes to get to.",Jason X

Well, this movie combines elements from Star Trek (Next Generation), American Pie and all the other Jason movies.  The fact that Jason's ""upgrade"" was aggravating.  You see, Jason was only enhanced for about 10 percent of the movie.  For the entire other 90 percent he was like the old Jason.  Also, there were these ANTS that could regenerate wounds and heal. What made me mad was that these ants enhanced Jason but they didn't repair any of Jason's victims.  What's up with THAT?  That infuriated me!  So many plot holes.  Why are their nothing but American Pie hot chicks on this ""space ship""?  That was lame.  Even the band girl from American Pie was in this movie.  Her death was the grossest.  She was sucked through a vent due to a hole in the spaceship that made all the air go out into space.  There were other gross killings.  One guy was impaled on a screw (giant).  When one of crew asks what this guys condition is, the reply is ""he's screwed"". How NOT funny.  There was even an ANDROID that somehow manages to do the MOST damage to Jason.  This ANDROID was kind of like DATA!!  She yearned to ""become human.""  Can you say, RIP OFF OF STAR TREK!?  Of course, there is the tough black sergeant who resembles the Candyman.  He's all tough and says some really stupid lines.  I hated this movie.  What made it worse was that everybody in the theater was hysterically laughing.  That's BAD MOVIE EDIKIT!

83,Howlin Wolf,Is the 'Jason' franchise beyond a joke?! Apparently not!,7,26 February 2005,"Thanks to ""Scream"", we live in an age where post-modern horror is now the 'de-rigeur' thing; and your franchise is nowhere unless you have at least ONE entry that follows such a pattern. (Think ""Freddy"" & Chucky""... ) So comes 'Jason X'; and it's clear from the start that there's nothing at all here that was meant to be taken seriously. This is an episode definitely NOT above chucking in liberal doses of humour to go along with the required entrails and thus hopefully swell the studio coffers. You know what? I prefer it this way, too! Staunch devotees may find themselves disagreeing with me, but this is a welcome new direction for Mr. Voorhees; and the knowing chuckles combined with lots and lots of blood turn what could have been yet another painful slog into a fun send-up of horror clichés past - and indeed, tired plot-elements in general...I'd rather they go for the funny-bone where the Fridays are concerned; since I can't honestly say I had all that much affection for them in the first place; unlike in the cases of Child's Play and A Nightmare on Elm Street. It's been proved that the former AND the latter are perfectly suited to 'seriousness'; whereas I've ALWAYS struggled to take Jason seriously as anything more than a cheap Michael Myers knockoff, right from the start - so this could be his 'niche'... !!! The movie finds time to use its future setting cleverly; exploiting the possibilities both for elaborate deaths, and indeed, the 'post-modern wit' earlier described... A clever use of virtual-reality in particular to ensnare Jason provides a fun projection of how people might look back on the saga as a whole, in our OWN distant future! The props may have gone a little more 'space-age' (if perhaps, no less 'cheap-looking'... !) but it's nice to see that underneath the new exterior there is still retained a certain element of people lurking behind props in the haunted house, waiting to go ""Boo""... ! 'Terror' is quite a simple reflex-mechanism to engender, if you think about it; and most of the old values are happily not lost, even though the surroundings were deemed in need of an 'upgrade'...Judging on ""Resurrection"", the 'Halloween' series ought to think seriously about the option of gravitating toward INTENTIONAL laughs, too... Yes, this film features pretty amateur surgeons in sheer cutoff tops; but what the heck is wrong with that, when the dominant tone is one of tongue-in-cheek spoofery???! Traversing the comedic route has effectively resuscitated this series more effectively than a bolt of lightning EVER did... If people can't hear you 'scream' in space, they might be able to hear you chortle, at least... ! (Yes, there are SEVERAL references to the 'Alien' franchise in the actual movie, as well!)",Jason X
84,rivertam26,The weakest of the series,5,13 March 2020,I know alot of people love this one. But besides some clever homages and one cool ass death scene with liquid nitrogen it all plays out like an overly mediocre episode of andromeda which makes sense because so many people from the show are responsible for this. The plot is unimportant but basically Jason is frozen and than thawed out in the future aboard a space ship where he wreaks havoc. The FX are okay and the characters are mostly unlikable and annoying aside from the retro leading lady and Kane Hodder of course. It's not a terrible movie I especially enjoyed the 80s sleeping bag scene but I do feel like it's the weakest of the series. The uber Jason design is cool but unnecessary and the fact that they're aware their making a bad movie is i believe its biggest problem. Because instead of avoiding those pitfalls it becomes what it's making fun of.2.5/5,Jason X
85,Pumpkin_Man,Jason Goes on a Star Trek!!!,10,16 August 2009,"(I'm pretending that this takes place after FREDDY VS. JASON) Years after Jason won the battle with Freddy, he is caught by the Government. He is about to be frozen, then some stupid Government people come and want to take Jason away for more research. Jason is finally frozen after Rowan shoots him into cryogenic chamber. Jason stabs her, freezing her as well. 445 years later, Jason and Rowan are found and taken to a spacecraft with some students aboard. Rowan is helped, and Jason wakes himself up. Soon, a bloody massacre happens. The ships soldiers try to stop him, but they can't. Later, an android named Kay-Em 14 is uploaded and kills Jason. Then, Jason is upgraded by the nanotechnology. Jason looks awesome when this happens!!! One of the students tries to distract Jason by using a simulation of Crystal Lake, but Jason soon realizes, it's a fake. It's an awesome horror/sci fi film and an awesome Jason film. If you love Jason and sci fi movies, you'll love JASON X!!!",Jason X
86,baumer,Is this the best they could come up with?,1,9 May 2002,"Warning: may be some spoilersYou know, back in the day, Jason was actually scary.  He was a true killing machine that could strike fear in those that watched his films and worshipped him in some way.  But as the films and years went on, something strange and unfortunate happened; Jason got incredibly bland and worse than that he became a cheap caricature of himself.  Jason was once the epitome of fear, now he is just an after-thought.  This is a tangential film that only bears the villains name to remind us what once was.  And my advice to Sean Cunningham is to either stop making the Friday films all together or get back to the old formula or what was once remembered as a proud franchise that pioneered the horror craze in the 80's is going to sink under it's own ineptitude.  And this is coming from one of it's biggest fans.  Please, make it better.Can you remember back to the early Friday's?  Can you remember what made watching the films so much fun?  It was the fact that first of all, Jason was scary but moreso he was also very phlegmatic, like Michael Myers was. He didn't take things personally, he just killed without passion.  He was the ultimate killer.  In the first four films, Jason was nothing more than a boy who had grown up to kill with an insatiable need for blood and corpses. Now the franchise has gone off on it's own little tangent and subjected Jason to a ridiculous folklore that just doesn't fit with who he was.  Part 9 dropped the ball by inundating us with that stupid ""special knife"" story and a sister angle when all of us know damn well that he was an only child. Face it, unless you are George Lucas, you cannot introduce family members late into a story and get away with it.  So Jason goes to Hell with Freddy bringing him there but now he in space and he decides that he has to kill again and again and again but with no real passion.  There is no stalking in this one, there is no desperation.  All we have is Jason rounding a few corners and killing the next person that no one cares about.  At least in the earlier ones we knew a little bit about who he was killing.  Think Tommy Jarvis, think Shelly, think of Chris, think of Ginny and Paul and Rick and so on.  There was at least a bit of character development to the people that Jason was slaughtering.  There was also a legend and most of all there was atmosphere.  And correct me if I am way off base here, but didn't James Cameron already take this premise and do it much better in 1986 with guys like Bill Paxton, Lance Henrikson and Michael Biehn?There was one very well done scene in Jason X and that was when he is in VR Crystal Lake.  Someone else commented that all of a sudden the film became interesting again when he was there.  You could hear the music, you could see the cabins and the lake and suddenly that comforting feeling of Jason at Crystal Lake was omnipresent again.  Jason X doesn't have the slightest idea of what it was that made the franchise so successful in the first place. 
This is one of the lousiest films I have seen and I was sure that nothing could top part nine and eight as the worst Friday's but this one does.0 out of 10",Jason X
87,DunnDeeDaGreat,For serious Friday fans only(minor spoilers),4,27 April 2002,"The fan in me loved Jason X, but the critic in me hated. First let's start with the fna part. The film has nudity, great one liners and good death scenes that one would expect from a Friday film. Now the critic in me knows that h can pull a better film out of his a*s. The movie is horribly edited, the dialouge is horrible and the acting is very tepid. There's also no back story what so ever. See this one only if you're a serious Friday fan.",Jason X
88,mentalcritic,Not as bad as people say it is...,6,18 May 2003,"When a film series hits ten sequels, you know that the writing staff are just trying to hold onto any kind of meal ticket they possibly can, sure that nothing else they put together will bring home the bacon. After all, who can honestly look me in the eye and say that the tenth James Bond film (or any episode featuring Roger Moore) was anything other than an expensive stream of fire-lighters?It seems there are two schools of thought about Jason X as a result. There are the hardcore fans who seem to think that using the same basic plot over and over and over is a good thing despite the fact that this episode outgrossed its three most immediate predecessors put together. Then there are the people who have watched more than two dozen films in their lifetime, and are ready to recognise that sometimes a little variety is a good thing.Jason X distinguishes itself from the previous eight rehashes by adding a very basic, superficial sci-fi setting. This is the first good move, as one critic I normally violently disagree with has described the other eight films as ""the ultimate in recycling - so much so that you forget which episode you are watching after a while"". At least there is little chance of mistaking Jason X for episodes one through nine. There is also the element of digital photography. I would have loved to have seen this film theatrically, especially after the grainy, out of focus crap that George Lucas proclaimed as the future with his digital Star Wars. It would have been nice to see if digital photography truly is capable of delivering what its proponents claim. If the DVD-Video of Jason X is anything to go by, then George Lucas should be informed that he is doing more to hurt the digital revolution than help it.Anyway, I am not going to comment on the plot, since it has been done to death, and it appears that the American Butcher's Association has once again failed to recognise that adults watch films, too. The DVD-Video sold in Australia runs almost as long as the IMDB-quoted theatrical running time, which means that at least three and a half minutes of footage that was deleted from the USA theatrical exhibition is present on Australian home videos. About the only complaint that I have here is the Kay-Em droid, who really does more to annoy the audience and ruin the experience than add to anyone's enjoyment. Kane Hodder is in great form as the hockey-masked killer, however. Unlike the majority of people who have played Jason in the past, Hodder really looks the part of a demented woodsman who has grown up totally cut off from civilisation. Anyone who has any doubts about that should take a good look at some of the frontal shots of Uber-Jason. That guy really must have eaten his Wheaties as a boy. Such a pity that the MPAA butchered his first two appearances as Jason beyond recognition (a fact that is hilariously referenced in the illusion-campsite scene).In all, if you are into films, and not circular rehashes of the same old tired plot ad nauseum, then Jason X is for you. It's not the most creative thing you'll ever see, and it's not the best horror film on Earth, but the mere fact that they were brave enough to do something different and have a little bit of fun with it elevates the tenth Friday The 13th far above eight of its nine predecessors. I can see why they dumped the FT13 moniker, quite frankly.",Jason X
89,mattymatt4ever,Quite enjoyable,6,23 November 2002,"*SOME SPOILERS AHEAD*I'm glad James Isaac, the director, decided to return to the B-movie formula after the disappointing ""Jason Goes to Hell,"" which was simply a failed A-movie effort.  Now, the acting, storyline and dialogue are definitely in perfect B-movie tradition, but the directing and production design were quite impressive.  I loved the color schemes and use of the digital camera, which was then transferred onto film.  I loved the digital look of the film, it's almost flawless.  And though the special f/x were obviously generated by computers, they also looked pretty cool.  OK, so we got ourselves another screwy idea of how to bring Jason back to life, but heck...we love Jason so much that we can't stand to see him go. What makes ""Jason X"" so much fun to watch is that there's no pretentions. This is pure camp and doesn't try to be any more than pure camp, and it simply takes the genre of camp slasher flick and runs with it as far as it can.  This tenth (I'm not quite sure if I can call it the final) chapter contains a lot more humor than the previous sequels.  Most of the sequels did contain a certain degree of humor, but this one takes the cake.  There are many funny scenes and lines of dialogue, including one where one of the female victims is about to die and her last words are ""This sucks on so many levels.""  Another funny line occurs when the big black guy got stabbed in the ribs by Jason.  He says, ""It'll take more than a poke in the ribs to kill me.""  After Jason stabs him again, he says, ""That'll do.""  You can call this movie weird, you can call it insane, but you gotta give it points for originality.  Of course, in great B-movie tradition, all the female characters look like they leaped straight out of the pages of ""Playboy"" or ""Penthouse.""  Even the scientist, who gets frozen along with Jason, is hot as hell.  Though most of these chicks don't get naked, at least they run around in tight, skimpy clothing.  As I've said in past reviews, most of the people watching these flicks are guys, so you may as well appeal to the general demographic.  I just wish that gloriously hot blonde chick in the beginning didn't get killed off so early and died of such ugly death--her face frozen and smashed into pieces.  As far as the nudity factor goes, at least I got my wish at the near end of the film, when those two hot babes stripped off their tops. It kinda sucks that there was only brief nudity, but it's definitely a scene worth fast-forwarding to and rewinding over and over again. 
The most entertaining scene in the movie is when the victims are all cornered by Jason and don't know what the hell to do, until the robotic woman pops up like a warrior, in a scant leather outfit, holding a machine gun.  You can't help but cheer on the top of your lungs when that scene comes up.  If you're a movie critic, you can pick apart this movie in many ways, but its flaws are what charmed me about the film.  The acting is bad, but it was bad to the extent where it made me smile (rather than cringe).  The dialogue is also bad, but it made me laugh, and it sort of parodies the cheesy lines we hear in many trashy horror flicks.  Cool death scenes, hot chicks, great moments of humor, one great nude scene. What more can I ask for?  I'm not quite sure, but I felt the movie was missing something, which prevented it from making it any more than a slightly above-average film--at least in my opinion.  There was a certain aura of dullness to it, though I still had a good deal of fun. Nevertheless, it's definitely worth watching and worth renting on DVD (there's a great commentary and a great documentary about the Jason flicks). You pretty much have nothing to lose.  But I really wish they could've played ""Let the Bodies Hit the Floor"" somewhere in the film, because it sounded awesome in the trailer.  Once again, I must say:  Stop playing music in trailers if it's not gonna be in the film!  My score:  6 (out of 10)",Jason X

It's a cringe story and the ambiance is nothing compared to other sci-fi movies.",Jason X
91,ODDBear,Better than I thought,5,11 August 2006,"Jason's in space killing people. Why on earth not? Jason X had the good fortune of following 1993's Jason Goes to Hell, where the formula had already been flushed down the toilet. Jason Goes to Hell was so bad and by comparison Jason X fares extremely well. So, why not send Jason to space; I mean, it's something he hadn't done before. If you put yourself in the right frame of mind and realize that you have to have zero expectations; Jason X goes down rather well, surprisingly enough.In an amusing prologue, featuring David Cronenberg no less, Jason gets frozen along with a female scientist slated to be his next victim. A crew aboard a spaceship in the year 2455 picks them up and head back to Earth 2 (since our beloved planet earth is no longer habitable). Soon, Jason comes to life again and starts killing off the crew members in his usually grisly fashion. So, what does the year 2455 hold in store for us that's similar today? Well, the most striking thing is that teenagers and adults alike don't seem to get any smarter as time goes by.While this is a silly film, and I mean SILLY (writing, idiotic characters, sci-fi ripoffs from countless films etc. ) Jason X is an enjoyable time waster for fans of the series. His kills are quite inventive and well done, in fact the whole production values of the film were impressive, compared to it's low budget. The whole notion of Jason being in space is of course ludicrous but I must admit it turned out to be a lot more enjoyable than I thought.",Jason X

I saw this movie in the video store 11 years ago when I was in high school I saw the VHS cover of the film and I saw it on DVD. So finally I got this film on Blu-ray disc just finish it watching it today and I must say it is not a bad film I like it a lot. Like I said it is a guilty pleasure of mine. I know a lot of people hate this film I don't. I think is MILES way better then Jason Goes to Hell and Miles way better movie then Hellraiser: Bloodline that was in outer space this movie is just better.7.years ago when I become a fan of Supernatural I heard that Jared Padalecki will be in the reboot Friday the 13th movie I rushed to see this movie. I watch Friday the 13th the original, Friday the 13th Part 2, the (2009) reboot and this film Jason X and yes I like it.I thought this movie will copy Alien and Aliens but it didn't copy any of those films it was solid and it was original it had his own story. I didn't thought this movie was bad I thought it was an interesting story that had a good action and a good slasher kills.Lexa Doig was an alright as the final girl tough it was a science fiction film it was still good and I will still watching it. Lexa Doig was in The Tracker with Casper Van Dien and I liked that action film I haven't seen in a while.Jason Voorhees returns with a new look, a new machete, and his same murderous attitude as he is awakened on a spaceship in the 25th century.Lexa Doig worked in facility Crystal Lake in which they capture Jason Voorhees but he kills everyone and escapes but Rowan Lafontaine (Lexa Doig) freeze him and her self in 2008. The year is now 2455 and a new crew members on a ship unfroze those two only too realize they unfroze Jason Voorhees unstoppable killing machine. Now a new group of soldiers tries to defeat Jason who later becomes Uber Jason.Lisa Ryder was great, sexy and really hot as Kay-Em 14 I liked her, she really kicked Jason's ass and she shot him to death ha ha.So it is scary? No. Is it a good movie? No. Is it fun? VERY.I also forgot this movie is reference to Demolition Man (1993) my all time favorite futuristic action Stallone film. In which they were mention to Lexa Doig's character that she was in Cryo it references to Cryo-prison it is similar to Demolition Man.Jason X is a 2001 American science fiction slasher film produced and directed by James Isaac.

Honestly I have enjoyed this movie much more then I did Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan but that is just my opinion It is my favorite guilty pleasure of mine.",Jason X
95,eminkl,"Hey, at least it's better than the last one",2,18 April 2020,"Easily the fifth or sixth time Friday the 13th has jumped the shark, this time pulling a double corkscrew backflip along the way. Following in the hallowed footsteps of Leprechaun 4, Hellraiser: Bloodline and Critters 4, this installment finds Jason cryogenically frozen for four hundred years and defrosted aboard a lightly-staffed spacecraft. No explanation is offered for his abrupt return from the depths of the nether, where he was unceremoniously dumped at the end of Jason Goes to Hell, though I'm not sure that really would've made a difference. This is a willfully stupid playground for half-baked science fiction ideas, terrible wardrobe choices and budget special effects; a cut-rate production that would feel right at home on the Sci-Fi Channel at 3am. Predictable to the end, it touches all the bases with gratuitous nudity, shallow characters, mysterious returns from certain doom and a truckload of dismemberments / decapitations / deaths. The only thing we're missing is the trademarked screeching cat fake-out, presumably because no self-respecting animal would be seen in such a production. Apart from one fleeting moment of self-deprecating parody near the end - which is totally out of place, but admittedly had me howling - there's no reason for this to exist. It's the kind of thing that would've thrived on the bootleg circuit, akin to Roger Corman's unreleased Fantastic Four, but by actually sending it to theaters, New Line took the wind out of those sails. The best thing I can say here is, hey, at least it's better than the last one.",Jason X
96,fernandoschiavi,"A festival of the ridiculous that turns out to be unintentional entertainment (or not?), Jason X is a bizarre turn for the Friday The 13th series",4,11 September 2021,"Every successful franchise, especially the 80s horror ones, has its movie that symbolizes the rock bottom. Nightmare Hour 6: Freddy's Death (1991) was from the Freddy Krueger series Halloween 6: The Last Revenge (1995) was from Michael Myers and well... Jason X (2001) was from the Friday franchise -Fair 13. Once the most prolific of the genre, the series started in 1980 reached its tenth film already tired and lazy. The penultimate film had been a bombshell and New Line's official plans were to produce the long-awaited Freddy vs Jason (2003) clash. However, the crossover was a long and time-consuming process.That's when Sean S. Cunningam, the franchise's producer and director of the first movie, said they needed a new movie to keep the character in people's mouths, but no one had an idea for the tenth of Friday the 13th. Not until Todd Farmer arrives, giving the idea of taking the Hockey Mask Killer into space. He forgets Jason is in hell alongside Freddy Krueger. In this space incursion by the antagonist who murdered more than a hundred people in Crystal Lake (and in New York as well), there is no direct connection with Jason Goes To Hell - Last Friday, the previous episode of the franchise. We don't know how and why, but Jason seems to have escaped hell and bitter his last days at a Research Facility in Crystal Lake.At the site, the young man is under the supervision of Rowan (Lexa Doig), but his superiors want to move Jason away because of some financial investments. This sovereignty appears in the skin of the exceptional David Cronenberg, filmmaker responsible for classics such as A Mosca and Scanners, who here makes a point to give credibility to his film colleagues. What we expected happens: Jason manages to escape and Rowan will have to face him, until after an unsafe procedure, both end up in a cryogenic suspension compartment, becoming two frozen specimens found only in 2455, thanks to the incursion of the archaeologist Lowe (Jonathan Potts) and his troupe of students. They inhabit Earth 2, given that our planet is destroyed.Jason is taken into space along with Rowan. Both go through the resuscitation attempt. With the girl, the process is successful. Jason, as the killing machine we've known and loved since the 1980s, also resurrects, throwing the party right at the arrival ceremony, attacking researcher Adrienne (Kristi Angus), a character created in honor of the final girl of the franchise's first film. Death became one of the most talked about in the series: he first freezes the girl's face, then smashes it into several pieces, like a crystal. Insane, but no less fun.Jason Voorhees' tenth film has a certain quality to its making, almost like an old episode of Stargate or Andromeda; not by chance, the actress Lexa Doig is the protagonist. It's more of a sci-fi parody B than a horror movie itself, so much so that Jason X doesn't make much sense within the official chronology, after all, Jason should be in hell and not being used as a guinea pig for scientists in the future, so when one of the character's comments that ""a creature that can't be killed would be too valuable to dump,"" we know that Todd Farmer's text is a metalanguage about the franchise itself and its endless sequels.Jason X has everything fans of the series would want to see: violent deaths, beautiful women, tributes to the franchise's movies (including a sex scene), really strong enemies and even an updated look for the famous killer. Kane Hodder, highly inspired, brings a strong Jason, with his deep breathing and quite menacing. Here, he has hair, but not the ridiculous strands from the previous movie. He also no longer lets out the grunts that destroyed the ninth part, nor does he throw his victims everywhere. He kills without mercy, rips his head off, cuts it into pieces and even faces a virtual monster, in one of the funniest scenes in the movie.Taking advantage of the futuristic environment, Jason faces the agility of a cyborg extremely prepared for a fight with the assassin and also participates in a virtual reality, set in 1980, in Crystal Lake. With the repetition of the famous little song (reedited in the second film), Jason beats the sleeping bags with the girls against a tree, mercilessly. The scene was inspired by Friday the 13th - Part VII, where Kane Hodder ended up getting very tired of carrying the heavy bags over and over again. According to the original screenplay, the idea was to make Jason reunite with his mother in 1980 and kill her, showing his total irrationality and malice. The scene ended up not being filmed.It's fun and bizarre to see how Farmer mixes typical space exploration movie characters with the banal clichés of the Friday 13 slasher movie. Where else would you imagine seeing horny teenage scientists on the deck of a spaceship? Or maybe that the ship's officers all wear tops? Again, it's more of a parody than a serious movie, and Farmer really pushes the envelope by exploring an android character (played by Melyssa Ade), but it's fun when the story requires a heavy fight between artificial intelligence (with machine guns and costumes from leather) and Jason. It's a guilty pleasure of the big ones.But the quotes don't stop there: one of the characters in the film is called Adrienne, in direct reference to the actress Adrienne King, who played the heroine of the first film. At a certain point, Jason finds his old machete and decides to use it again on Prof. Lowe, the movie's comic relief, as well as the cyborg herself. Jason repeats several classic deaths from the series in this film, such as the traditional slit throat and the knife thrown from a distance; Jason's mask is removed at one point, featuring a deformed Jason who closely resembles the character in the original film.It's obvious that not everything is perfect in the film (""perfect"" in the sense of ""fun""). The final sequence, with Jason flying and everything, is ridiculous. The quick transformation of the assassin into ""Robocop"" is blamed on the bad editing (where the machine managed to develop the new mask, no one knows); and even the script fails to say that they tried to kill him anyway and failed, without mentioning the character's supernatural characteristics. Why, sometimes, he came back by macabre luck indeed; when Jason blows the ship apart from the outside and depressurization takes place, the effect ends after a victim is sucked out. Jason keeps breaking down the doors, but no one else gets pulled...among other nonsense.As Sean S. Cunigham points out in Donald R. Beck's documentary Secrets Behind the Massacre, the magic show involving the first night of horror at Crystal Lake was replaced by the special effects and CGI of this episode, which made it easier to be conceived in aesthetic aspects. The filmmaker also claims that the production was a step forward, after all, unlike the camp, it is more difficult to imagine what will happen in a plot located in a space totally different from the traditional one. It's a movie that reminds a lot of Syfy's productions. James Isaac creates a believable and sufficiently futuristic world without ever drawing much attention to himself. Of course the CGI used in some sequences (like the bizarre ant treatment) has aged terribly, but the sets and settings work. Seeing Jason in such a different context is heartening, especially when the killer uses some improvised weapons (see head freeze) to execute his victims, and some sequences involving dark places are almost capable of reminding us of Alien - or, at worst, from Alien: Resurrection.A festival of the ridiculous that turns out to be unintentional entertainment (or not?), Jason X is a bizarre turn for the Friday the 13th series, and it explores well the mix of the slasher genre and science fiction. Open-minded and unpretentious, the viewer can find plenty to enjoy.",Jason X

They bring both bodies on board their spacecraft, where both subjects eventually thaw out and the one wearing the goalie mask goes on a murder spree.When I first heard that the 10th entry in the franchise is gonna be Jason in outer space, I thought that it sounded stupid and was gonna be rubbish but when I saw the film I was pleasantly surprised, sure it was corny and the story line is ridiculous but I loved it Jason is back and he's on form unlike the disappointing previous entry ""Jason Goes To Hell"".This 10th chapter in the ""Friday the 13th"" franchise retains the same energy as the previous entries but delivers it in a spaceship setting. You want to see Jason put ""Rambo"" to shame as he hunts down some ex-grunts? Right here, a-holes! Or how about Jason going mano-a-mano against a leather-clad, gun-toting female Android? You got it! Jason X has its fair share of slash and crash, but at the same time, it emanates an ""Aliens"" (an obvious inspiration) type of vibe. Some purists might say that's a negative thing, but I believe that after nine films, Jason needed a change of scenery like I needed a new ""bootie call"". They slapped old hockey-puss in space and managed to pull it off. Props to all! Okay the film is low budget but I found the special effects were pretty good, the spacecraft simple yet effective costumes are colourful. I particularly enjoyed the S&M-like outfit that Kay-Em (Ryder) sported after getting her robotic cherry popped. Nice! Our boy Jason hasn't changed much. He felt more human this time around though (he has hair!) and doesn't look like the zombie he was in part 6-7-8-9. I found Jason less menacing than he was in ""Friday The 13th Part 7"", but he still got the grisly job done. I also loved it when Jason gets the big terminator style makeover where he's all metal and robotic and such and such like. The fight sequence between Jason and the robot woman is definitely the highlight of the film and the kills are wicked and fresh.The good thing is that ""Jason X"" is just a good cheesy slasher and it doesn't pretend to be anything else but that. Yes, the good guys are weak and the film doesn't always capitalise on its groovy situations but we still get lots of explosions, kills, fights sequences, some occasional funny dialogue, some humorous situations (loved the Virtual Reality sequence) and Jason even gets to re-visit ""Crystal Lake"" to entertain two female campers in his own charming way.Kane Hodder (Jason) gives Jason more of a human personality this time around, but I didn't find him as threatening as he was in the previous entries. Lexa Doig (Rowan) handles her part well, but I would've liked to see her kick more ass. Lisa Ryder (Kay-Em) steals the show as the sexually curious, Kung Fu android. She has fun with the role. Jonathan Potts (Professor Rowe) does the pathetic creep thing well, but yes, he irritated me. Melyssa Ade (Janessa) is cute and her delivery is on, but her character didn't do it for me. She's kind of despicable. Peter Mensah (Sergeant Brodski) was charming as the resilient Marine. I loved every second that he was on screen. Chuck Campbell (Tsunaron) bored me as the geek and he had his moments of ""weak"" acting.All in all being a hardcore Jason fan I absolutely loved this entry in the Friday The 13th series, I loved the female robot, the action sequences, the kills and the over the top special effects.",Jason X
101,Darkside-Reviewer,In space only Jason can hear you scream!,5,21 November 2020,"The tenth movie in the long running Friday the 13th series, Jason X took the series in a very different direction by putting Jason Voorhees into space aswell as four hundred years into the future where humanity now lives on earth 2 where the teenagers are still just horny idiots just waiting for Jason to kill them.Jason X is exactly the movie you expect it to be an over the top slasher movie that doesn't take itself too seriously giving it's audience exactly what they asked for an entertaining slasher movie that's just an hour and a half of Jason Voorhees killing various people in bloody entertaining ways. The special effects while dated by today's standards were actually pretty decent for a low budget slasher movie made in the early 2000s.The idea of putting Jason Voorhees in space is as crazy and silly as it sounds. This is probably the least serious entry in the Friday the 13th series to date and that's in a movie series that has had some very odd entry's which have included a copycat Jason Voorhees killer, followed by the resurrection of Jason that essentially made him an unkillable zombie, then a movie where Jason fights a girl with telekinetic powers, then Jason went to Manhattan where toxic waste turned him back into a child which was ignored in the next movie where Jason dies but comes back once again as a body snatcher creature which ends with him being sent to hell with Freddy Kreuger, after all that it's no surprise Jason went to space it's the next logical step in a series as crazy as this one.Jason X was released in 2001 but was actually filmed in 1999 and was first released in Germany in the year 2000 before it was finally released in the US in 2001. The movie was made during the Matrix craze era of the early 2000s when every movie was trying to get in on the science fiction craze brought about by the success of The Matrix.I recommend Jason X if your a fan of old school slasher movies that focus more on the death scenes and special effects it's fun, bloody and entertaining like a Jason movie should be.",Jason X
102,jp_91,It was good in 2001.,10,18 December 2019,"In 2001 Jason X was a great film, different than the rest films in the franchise. The special effects looked great then, it was the beginning of a new century and the second year of the 2000's decade, Jason X was a modern piece by then. Today the movie is funny but the special effects looks very old. The script is decent and entertaining, the performances are fine and the direction is ok. Not amazing, but much better than part 8. A good work of this Canadian-American slasher flick.",Jason X
103,LebowskiT1000,Better than many of the previous Friday the 13th films!,7,26 November 2002,"No, I'm not going to sit here and try to defend the film.  Yeah, it was a terrible film, it really was.  But I've got to say it wasn't nearly as bad as most of the previous Friday the 13th films.  This one at least has some originality to it.  I agree is was a bit of a stretch to have Jason Vorhees in space, but at least it opened some doors for some interesting and futuristic deaths, weapons, characters and what not.  I can't believe people would say this one was worse than the previous 7 films, they're all just different ways of telling the same story and virtually nothing new to look at!  At least this one was an interesting change of scenery.The acting was nothing to get excited about, but c'mon, it's the 10th movie in a horror series, what can you expect?  Besides, the movie doesn't require good acting, I'm not watching this film for acting talent.On the upside, the women in the film were very good looking.  Virtually every female in the cast was very attractive and quite nice on the eyes.Also, a lot of people said that the special effects weren't very good.  Well no, they aren't very good compared to ""The Matrix"" or ""Jurassic Park"", but for a Jason film, they were pretty darn good.  I was personally very impressed with the special effects, I'm sure the budget was pretty small for this film and somehow they pulled off some pretty good special effects. Also, before I forget, I really liked the opening title sequence in the film.  Very well done (MUCH better than ANY of the previous Friday the 13th films).The dialogue in the film was really bad, with a number of moments that just make you want to cringe because you can't believe how stupid the lines are.The whole Uber-Jason thing was stupid as all hell!  Why did they do that? Ok, I can understand the machine that fixes humans actually putting Jason back together, but why would it make him better than before?  And why, oh why, would it create a new hockey mask for him and make his whole right side out of metal?  I cannot even begin to express how stupid that is!  That aside...the make up effects were actually pretty impressive and well done.No, I wouldn't recommend this film to just anyone, but if you are a Jason fan, go ahead and watch it.  ...And if you are just a mediocre Jason fan and a sci-fi fan, then go ahead and check this one out.  In all honesty, you don't need to watch any of the previous films to understand what's going on here (it might even be better if you don't).  Although, it might be nice to watch the first two films, and they may shed some light on subject.  If, you do choose to see this film, I hope you enjoy it.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",Jason X
104,Spanner-2,Jason returns in fine form.,9,29 April 2002,"Alrighty now.. the long awaited 10th film in the legendary ""Friday the 13th"" movie series hits theatres and what is the result? If you liked the previous nine you will like this one, if the hockey masked machete wielding Jason Voorhees isnt your cup of tea then you should probably avoid the latest installment in the franchise. In this film, Jason (once more played by stuntman Kane Hodder) is placed in suspended animation and winds up getting thawed out on a spaceship some 400 or so years later to wreck havoc on a hapless group of hollywood newbies who decided to audition for this film. Actualy the cast is pretty good as this sort of thing goes and the producers decided to have some fun with the concept, throwing in everything from an obvious ""Alien"" inspired storyline to a ""Terminatrix"" babe (played by Lisa Ryder, who like co-star Lexa Doig hails from the ""Andromida"" TV Series). Some funny bits with Jason and a pointed parody of the original film due to a virtual reality simulation (!) make this one a step above most of the efforts in this series. So, until Jason rises again, this one is a keeper for fans of slasher movies worldwide. GRADE: B+",Jason X
105,FilmFanInTheHouse,Friday the 13th meets Star Trek,4,12 May 2009,"Jason X Directed by Jim Isaac and starring Kane HodderEVIL GETS AN UPGRADEFriday the 13th meets Star Trek, when Jason Voorhees takes a step too far and jumps into space. Gone are the scares which are required for a horror film. Effects at times can be laughable and the acting is a horror all by itself. With a Shatner lookalike Captain, the badly cast actor fail to make any character decent or memorable. Best acting goes to Kane Hodder, who you don't ever see or hear. Definitely the weakest of the franchise.His unique ability to regenerate lost and damaged tissue, it's just it cries out for more research. – Dr. Wimmer (David Cronenberg)",Jason X

107,baileycrawly,Yawn.,1,28 October 2019,"I didn't think it could get much worse than Jason Goes to Hell but... yeah, this is bad. I'm starting to theorize why most Friday the 13th boxed sets only have 1-8. I feel like even the studio is probably ashamed of 9 & 10.And justifiably so. They're horrible.So the basic (spoiler-reduced) synopsis is:Jason gets cryogenically frozen to be thawed 400 years later so he can basically do the same thing he's done during every other movie, but in the future.The characters are unlikable, the story reeks of series fatigue and corporate greed. The movie simply has no purpose. It's missing everything that made most of the earlier entries entertaining. It's just... a hollow slasher where things keep happening, but nothing occurs that's of particular interest to the viewer.I personally disown Jason Goes to Hell and Jason X as Friday the 13th films, because they're horrendous. The eighth entry, Jason Takes Manhattan, should've been the last. Because that movie was actually fun and enjoyable.And, of course, even Freddy vs. Jason ignores this film's existence... good riddance! Never again on this one.",Jason X

Jason is scary, the lighting is cool, and the killings are violent and sudden. Then, the film fast forwards 450 years and becomes a science fiction movie. But, not just any ol' sci-fi, but a specific type of sci-fi...In the 2000's, the Sci-Fi channel ran bad movies all weekend - movies they produced themselves, with bad acting, bad lighting, and bad special effects. No one complained, because it was just one channel wasting money on bad projects. 'Jason X' (2001) is a poorly produced Sci-Fi channel movie, made with Sci-Fi channel actors, in the same Canadian studios that produced all of the bad Sci-Fi channel movies that plagued the basic cable boxes of the early 2000's.With that said, there are some high points. Jason is scary and Lisa Ryder is hot as a robot. My favorite aspect of this film is the fact that, upon completion of this review, there is only one more in the franchise for me to watch.

109,chrisbrown6453,"It's been nine years since the last Jason movie hit theaters, and while Mr. Voorhees has been away we saw the rise and fall of the post-modern slasher movie.",7,18 June 2002,"Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer showed there was new life in this sub-genre of horror, with their heroes and heroines a little smarter and wiser than the oversexed victims we saw in the first Friday the 13th and Halloween flicks. In fact, even the Halloween franchise got in on the post-modern act by having Jamie Lee Curtis return to face Michael Myers one last time in Halloween: H20 (well, until the forthcoming sequel, anyway.) So here we are in 2002 and now it's Jason's turn to get a reboot in Jason X, his tenth film and New Line Cinema's second with the character. I'll admit that I gave up watching Friday the 13th films after the third installment. I don't count myself as a big fan of this genre because I know Jason is gonna survive each film, no matter what happens. From speaking to friends and acquaintances who have seen all the Friday the 13th  movies out there, part of the appeal the Friday films offer to slasher fans is the fun in watching Jason off his prey in new and creative ways. For that reason alone fans of Jason will probably enjoy Jason X as it offers plenty of grisly kills that haven't been seen before. But does it offer anything else besides an impressive body count? After a cool opening credit sequence where the camera is inside Jason, we see the homicidal hockey mask wearing maniac has finally been captured and is being held in solitude. Rowan (Lexa Doig) doesn't want Dr. Wimmer to take Jason away from the secure facilities at the Crystal Lake Research Facility. Of course, Jason breaks free and offs everyone there except for our heroine who manages to freeze Jason (and herself) just before she has a date with the Grim Reaper. Time passes and 500 years later Earth is a forgotten wasteland. A group of visiting history students uncover the entombed Jason and Rowan, take them back into their spaceship and thaw them out. Now that the first act of the picture is out of the way, the carnage truly begins. As far as Friday the 13th films go, Jason X has some superior assets. The set design of the spaceship Grendel sure looks cool, and the visual FX by Toronto-based Toybox are pretty kick-ass all around (especially for one scene where soldiers play in a holodeck). The actors all do a good enough job given the material they're working with -- you know, have sex, scream, collect paycheck -- and the characters are likeable enough. Kane Hodder's Jason is, well, Jason and he does what one expects him to do when a big homicidal maniac wields a machete. Extra kudos are given to Lisa Ryder, who plays the android Kay-Em 14. Ryder's mechanical character comes across very different than her Andromeda starship captain role she's best known for, more subdued and likeable. I've read elsewhere that Jason X has by far the largest body count of any previous films, and that certainly gives an incentive for horror fans to go check it out. But... somewhere along the way I think Jason X veered left when it should have veered right. This should be a film that focused on capturing a wider audience, say people like me who fell away from the Friday the 13th series because, after awhile, every Friday movie seemed the same. While credit needs to be given to screenwriter Todd Farmer for going that extra step into the unknown and taking Jason off-planet and placing him into a sci-fi setting, I think Farmer needed to take the material that one extra and dangerous step further: into satire. Sam Raimi did this with Evil Dead II and the resulting fusion of horror and comedy paid off in a huge way. Evil Dead II is considered a classic by just about every horror fan, and I was hoping Jason X could utilize this approach to make Jason Voorhees' approach more appealing and less familiar. Farmer and director James Isaac try hamming it up in later scenes but by this time the tone of the movie has already been established, and the result are moments that should have been funny but instead you roll-your-eyes and groan out loud. Also following into the realm of missed opportunity was the chance to play with some sci-fi clichés we've all seen since the first Friday the 13th film came out more than 20 years ago. There are some in the picture, like Rowan asking about ""beaming off"" the ship or the Aliens-like vibe coming from the Marines who are sent to hunt down Jason, but you're left wishing there were more of these, or better executed for more laughs. One stand-out example is the recreation of a Camp Crystal Lake hologram circa 1980 and Jason's interaction with it. Again, it works because it's played for the right amount of laughs and drama. The audience is already in on the joke; after nine films, we know what Jason's reaction would be but it's still fun to see it happen.When we're finally introduced to the new, upgraded Jason 2.0, there's surprisingly little of him in action before the film needs to be wrapped up. Of course, room for a sequel is left at the end of the film and it would be interesting to see where New Line decided to go in a future chapter.> Ultimately your mileage on Jason X will vary depending upon what you want to get out of it. If you're looking for a scary movie that winks at the audience a la Scream, you'll probably be disappointed. At the same time, die-hard fans will likely get more enjoyment from seeing the return of Jason and the new kills he notches along the way. And if you're someone like me who was hoping for more re-thinking of the entire franchise and the horror icon Jason Voorhees has become in the genre, you're split down the middle.As much as I dig that poster design and the concept of re-inventing this franchise and finding a way to appease the traditional Friday the 13th fan, Jason X remained a mixed bag for me.",Jason X

The music really sucked in this movie. They could of had better music. But other than that I personally think this was the second best Friday the 13th movie. Other than the first.

I got to like some and really hate others. They were very convincing. Jason is played yet again by Kane Hodder (thankfully!). There were some very good kills, and this was a whole new setting for Jason. But it worked very well. I personally liked Uber-Jason, although many hated him. Come on people, it had to be done!

113,TwistedContent,Jason Parties on a Spaceship,4,26 August 2021,"Sometimes long pumped out horror franchises head to space, like Leprechaun and Hellraiser, and the distinguished Jason couldn't escape it either. Finally, this is the last Friday-the-13th related movie I haven't seen. Low hopes and some excitement for a decent body rack was what I went in with. So, 25th century has the people living on Earth 2, but a single greedy doctor's and his uncannily 20th-century-alike flock of students exploration ship has just picked up a valuable relic on Earth 1. Guess one time. The plot is essentialy ""Alien"", just replace the xenomorph with Jason. Most of ""Jason X"" is what you would expect, a loud, glorious, stoopid mess, full of shiny and uninspired sets, completed with digital violence taking over practical effects, and a costume design that raises eyebrows. Protagonist characters are very cliché, not the smartest bunch and are very expendable, which Jason continuously makes sure of. My biggest complaint, really, is not enough diversity in the kills and gore section, or the stuff that could compensate for the overall silliness. Other than that, ""Jason X"" is a reasonably self-aware flick that spends almost all of its time racking up body count, sometimes so monotonously that boredom is born. Here and there a joke is inserted. A spoof on the franchise itself, the entire slasher genre? Maybe, but what does it change. If nothing else, it's at least entertaining. 4/10.",Jason X

That really shows the odd time and lunacy of studio idea's about horror films back in the early 2000s. With that said it could have been a complete disaster, and having seen the film numerous times there is almost an enjoyable aspect about it even though it's a poor film, the definition of a guilty pleasure I suppose. The beginning is great, we have Jason tied up, with a good looking actress, Lexa Doig, playing a scientist as the main lead, and then the legendary David Cronenberg as a quick cameo. However, once the plot turns into the mindless space odyssey, the film goes downhill. The jokes are terrible, action sequences are fake looking, it has terrible acting performances and the idea for little nano-bugs to create Jason's metal amour, just awful.

He awakes aboard a spaceship in 2455 and begins killing the people on board. While not as terrible as Part 7, this movie is really bad. The writers had to have run out of earthly ideas in order to come up with something as stupid as putting him in space in the future. I'm just glad they didn't put aliens aboard the ship.The acting in this movie is about as pathetic as it gets. One of the lead roles in the movie was played by the guy from the Expedia.com commericals. Awesome...You might think that people from the 25th century would be a little more advanced but uh...No, they're not. They're just as stupid as the people from the 80's slasher movies were.The special effects was a real cop out in this movie. This is the first Friday film that's used CGI for blood and gore. The plot of the film, as I've mentioned before, was retarded. A scene where they tried to reference earlier Friday the 13th films using holograms backfired by being utterly retarded looking.

The effects are decent, the kills are fun and Jason's science fiction upgrade at the film's conclusion is well done.This probably won't be liked by older Friday fans, but if you were born a little down the Friday chronology give this one a shot.

Some of the scenes, like when he knifes the guy when he opens the door, are priceless. The scene with the two ""premarital sex"" girls was funny when he beat one with the other.It does get strange with the new armor and face and he seems different. Instead of taking bullets like normal, they deflect off him like in Terminator 2. Plus the set seemed too much like Star Trek.Instead of infusing him with new tech, I would have had him kill a bunch of Trekkies in space.

120,Rendanlovell,Utterly embarrassing,1,25 July 2020,"The one in space.Admittedly, I may have jumped the shark calling Part 8 the worst of the franchise. If only I knew what I know now. Times were simpler back then. I should've savored that guy getting his head punched off into a dumpster, because Jason X may actually be the worst big budget movie of all time.Sure 14 million isn't close to the big budgets of today, but it has the biggest budget of the entire series! (Not counting Freddy vs Jason which has a 25 million dollar budget.) Part 6 is still a legitimately fun movie that was made for less then 6 million. This had nearly 3 times the budget of that and it looks like a student film. Did they hire people that were fresh out of high school to save money??It's set nearly 500 years after...who knows when because Jason went to hell in the last one, so how did he get out? When did he get out? Or are they ignoring that one and making this as a sequel to Jason Takes Manhattan? If that is the case that would be quite fitting. Having two of the worst horror movies ever made directly linked would be a happy coincidence. Anyway, this takes place in 2455 or something because why not?You'd think doing this would be very creatively freeing. You could have Jason wandering around fantastical sets, using futuristic weapons, and maybe you could have the humans of the future be pacifists so Jason could go on an absolute killing spree. But no, instead it's just Friday the 13th in a metal death trap they prentend is a space ship. Which you never buy, even for a second. The film has a blatant lack of imagination to the point of lunacy.Even Jason is completely uninspired in this. He wanders around slashing people with a regular machete. But it's futuristic because it's slightly curved and has holes for some reason. That's really the biggest issue here, a lack of creativity. It's the future because everything is metal and people wear slightly more tattered clothes, but there's still midterms. The sets look absurdly cheap, the cinematography is ugly and constantly underexposed, and the performances are series worst across the board.It's baffling how bad this is actually, and quite difficult to verbalize. This series has been quite the disappointment on the whole but this brings it to unwatchable levels. Even the worst entries have a certain camp or goofiness that keeps them afloat. There is no such thing here. It takes itself deadly serious, which is odd considering it features a robot trying to put fake nipples on to please her programmer. The dialogue is terrible, the premise sucks, the characters are annoying, the kills are bland, the sets are hideous, and it's inexcusably cheap looking for being the most expensive in the franchise (minus the next two).",Jason X

This one is just the others, except this one is in space. Towards the end, Jason becomes Uber-Jason. My favorite death in this when the girl's head is frozen and is smashed against the wall and shatters. That was sort of disgusting. They kill Jason but then he comes back as Uber-Jason and nothing can destroy him. But they blow the place that he's in up and he floats into space and lands in the lake while the 3 surviving people are safely in a escape pod. But when he falls in the lake a couple thought he was a shooting star. Then you see his mask in the lake. The end. Overall, this is just a high-tech slasher film.6/10",Jason X

The fact that this is the tenth movie in the Friday the 13th franchise, the most knuckle-draggingly, ball-scratchingly cretinous 'horror' series of all time AND it's set in space doesn't exactly suggest that this'll be an all-time classic, but it's a good fun way to kill an hour and thirty minutes nonetheless.Okay, the plot is so thin even a slight breeze would make it disintegrate and the horror element is practically non-existent but then Jason movies abandoned that long ago in favour of just providing dumb escapism with inventive and bloody death scenes, which this film certainly provides. People are sliced in half, impaled on large spikes, blown up, one poor woman even getting her head dunked in liquid nitrogen and shattered on a desk, but the characters are so one-dimensional and it's so cheesy you're more likely to laugh than scream. And I defy you to watch the scene when Jason gets transformed into 'Uber Jason' for the first time and not have a colossal grin traverse your face. There's even a later scene which pokes fun at the earlier movie's clichés with a hilarious ""beating one camper to death with the other"" sequence.This is not The Exorcist, it's not The Omen, it's even a very long way away from the original Friday The 13th, but as director James Isaac has said, ""it's just fun.""

It's got space, mindless sci-fi, androids, borg sex, sensuality, action, gore and finally, Jason Voorhees. The basic plot is really dumb, but works in a way to give a new touch to this 10th installment of ""Friday the 13th"" series. Because at least it is well-known that no director would take a risk of making a Jason movie again at Camp Crystal Lake, after ""Jason Goes to Hell"" literally murdered the famous slasher franchise. So we needed something new. Okay, ""JasonX"" IS something new. But it should have been way better.I think it's useless to point out keyholes in this disgusting story. But one thing must be said about the 'uber-Jason' -- it is totally crap. the old Jason with the hockey mask was way much cooler.

All I ask for is so very little with this type of film. Sadly, Jason X is pretty damn awful.  Out of the entire movie, there are two scenes I liked.  The first scene is involves a neat death.  Jason shoves a chick's head into a liquid that makes her head freeze, then he smashes it.  The next scene, and my favorite, involves Jason trapped in virtual reality.  The scenario is at Crystal Lake, and it involves two women who want to ""drink beer, smoke pot, and have premarital sex"" with Jason.  The way he ends up killing them is hysterical.The rest of the movie blows.  If you like gore, you might like it.  If you like anything authentic, stay away.",Jason X

Well, what do you get?... Wanna take a guess? JASON X of course! I'd love to see what the planning phase was like for this movie. Imagine a bunch of filmmakers sitting around: ""Where can we set this latest Jason movie?"" ""Ooh, I know... how about in the Wild West?"" ""Na!"" ""What if Jason turns up in LA and starts killing gang..."" ""Meh!"" ""Ooh. Ooh, I know... Jason onboard a ship!"" ""Hello? JASON TAKES MANHATTAN?!"" ""No, no... a SPACE ship!"" ""WE LOVE IT... here's $10 Million!!!"" So, in a half-cocked, hair-brained plot device, Jason winds up on a space ship several centuries in the future. And he pretty much does what he's always done. Stalking around and killing people. There are absolutely no interesting characters. The dialogue is eye-rolling atrocious. And it all feels so shoddy. Like an early episode of STAR TREK, but without the camp quality. There is one cool thing about this one however, Jason gets a solid metal mask! Other than that, this film is worthy of a photon torpedo carpet bombing!!!",Jason X
127,meathookcinema,An underrated gem,8,18 October 2018,"This film is basically Jason in Space.This movie massively divided fans. Some loved the innovation but some hated it to such an extent that they viewed it as the worst in the series. Yes, they even hated it more than Part 5: A New Beginning.But I loved this movie. I even went to see it a bunch of times during it's original release.Theres so much to love. The claustrophobia of the spacecraft, the tongue in cheek humour, the nerdy aspects of the film's vision (check out the eye operation on Jason and the way that injuries like severed limbs are remedied).Theres also an amazing cameo by David Cronenberg thats worth the price of admission alone.With this installment being based in space theres many nods to satify the most ardant sci-fi fanboys. Least not Lisa Ryder who was a star of Andromeda. Her android character is a great addition to the cast.Uber Jason is a sight to behold! And check out the liquid nitrogen kill. It's one of the best in the whole series.Highly recommended.",Jason X
128,Toronto85,Jason X,2,19 March 2011,"Man this one's really bad. Jason X is the tenth film in a series that (at the time) was going downhill. In fact, the series became a joke when Paramount sold the franchise to New Line Cinema. Anyways, the plot for this is that Jason gets frozen, and no one discovers him until 2455. By this time, Earth no longer exists and everyone lives on a planet called Earth II. Jason gets brought to life by a group of students/teachers that went to Earth to explore the land or something. He starts killing people on board the ship. That's basically it.There is so much bad about this film. The acting is horrendous, worse than any other Friday flick if you can believe it! I hate the turn this franchise took when New Line started making these films. It's all sci-fi. Jason Goes to Hell was a cheap version of Invasion of the Body Snatchers. And this movie is basically Aliens except substitute the ugly creature with Jason Voorhees. Friday the 13th films were originally scary and creepy horror/slasher films set in the woods. Parts 1-4 were amazing because they were simple. Even parts 5-8 were better then this Andromeda/Star Trek rip off.Jason X is kind of insulting to the series. It gets marks for Kane Hodder and one murder in particular. Jason freezes a woman's head and then smashes it in a thousand pieces. One of the more unique 'Friday' kills in the series. But overall, I just hate the direction of the series. Putting horror icons in space NEVER works. Pinhead in Hellraiser Bloodline, Leprechaun in Lep 4, hell even the Critters went to space in part 4. Those sequels were awful and this sequel is awful. EASILY the worst of the series.2/10",Jason X
129,Mr_Censored,2002: A Jason Odyssey,7,31 October 2008,"""This sucks on so many levels!"" In the horror genre, you have bad movies and then you have bad movies that know they are bad movies. ""Jason X"" is the latter. With nine films in the franchise, there is simply nowhere to go but upwards, and that's exactly where the tenth ""Friday The 13th"" (get it, Jason ""X""?) takes us. Like Pinhead and Leprechaun before him, Jason is thrusted into the outer reaches of space and resumes his slaughter of bad characters aboard a cheap looking spacecraft. However, unlike previous slashers gone skyward, Jason's adventure in space is actually an enjoyable trip.First things first, this is not a scary, suspenseful or even remotely serious horror film. If you are hoping to squeeze any genuine thrills out of this movie, don't bother. However, if you are a lifelong ""Friday The 13th"" fan who has seen enough of Crystal Lake and doesn't take one's self too seriously, then saddle up and enjoy the best Jason movie in a long while. That's right, I said it. Most people are wound too tight and take their precious genre favorites too seriously, but not me. When I want to unwind on a Friday night, have a few beers and turn my brain off, I find there is nothing more suiting than ""Jason X"". With it's winning combination of nudity, bloodshed, nostalgia (sleeping bags, anyone?) and sense of humor, it doesn't matter that some parts of the film are a bit dodgy. Despite the ridiculous premise -- a group of students find a frozen, hockey-masked, machete clutching meat-bag and thaw him out on the way home -- and the lack of substantial special effects (those exteriors were a JOKE) there is still quite a bit of juice in this installment. Kane Hodder is back as Jason for what would unfortunately be his final round. Hodder goes all out, playing the uber-angry Jason that he created for ""The New Blood"" and even manages to make a ridiculous cyborg version of Jason seem menacing. Director James Isaac, a David Cronenberg (who cameos in this flick) protégé, delivers an unusually (for this franchise) stylish show, and despite the meager production values, gets the job done effectively. The movie looks good, even when it looks bad, if that makes any sense. It also helps that the movie was built off a script by a Joe-blow nobody fan in Todd Farmer. Farmer apparently loves Jason as much as he watches the SciFi channel, and it shows. You'll have a blast catching all the call-backs to previous movies and the little inside jokes that only a well-versed fan could possibly catch. Now, as you're reading this review, you're probably asking yourself ""What's the downside of this film?"" Well, I'm not sorry to say this; There is nothing wrong with this film. You go into a movie like ""Jason X"" -- the ninth sequel in an overly saturated franchise, which finds the title character in space -- and what do you honestly expect? If you can, God forbid, suspend disbelief, stop taking yourself and the films seriously for 90 minutes, you too will have a blast with ""Jason X"".",Jason X

Seriously, folks, you may think I am making this up, but it's all true. Every damn word. See, Jason's body has been cryogenically frozen and, far into the future, it is discovered and thawed out. Big mistake. Jason awakens, reclaiming his machete and, after being vamped up into some sort of half mutant, half cyborg, once more sets about his slicing and dicing antics for our enjoyment. Now, here's the thing: anyone who complains about this movie is genuinely moronic. This is the 10th movie in the series. if you don't like them, don't watch them. Watching it and then complaining is like ordering a pizza then griping that you don't like cheese. Oh, and there's plenty of that here, too. The sci-fi twist is neat, and serves well as an excuse to reanimate Our Hero, and Jason's Borged up new look is pretty damn cool. The last twenty minutes descends into your usual running, screaming, chopping scenario, but it's to be expected.

132,RhapsodyReviews,"Dumb, but Fun Slasher.",7,10 October 2019,"Review:
'Jason X' is an American slasher film directed by Jim Isaac. It is the tenth installment in the 'Friday the 13th' film series. Why not take the franchise into space? It seems like the most logical step after not being able to create a good film since the first one.
In the year 2010, Jason Voorhees (Kane Hodder) is captured by the United States government and held at the Crystal Lake Research Facility. Government scientist Rowan LaFontaine (Lexa Doig) decides to place Jason in frozen stasis after several failed attempts to kill him. A breach is made, and Rowan is frozen alongside Jason for 455 years. Now aboard a ship in the far future they are both regenerated, and Jason continues his killing.
This is the tenth film in this series, and it's the 21 Century. Why can we still not get good actors? That's not to say the acting was bad, it was like it is in all of these movies, cheesy but suitable for what the actors are trying to accomplish. It's sad to see Kane Hodder leave after his fourth and final appearance in this film, he is my favorite Jason by far, really bringing this character to new levels.
I know that this isn't the best movie, and it does have a lot wrong with it realism wise and with continuity. God is it entertaining though! There's so much to love. The claustrophobia of the spacecraft, the tongue in cheek humour, the nerdy aspects of the film's vision. If nothing else, you need to appreciate the boldness in Jim Isaac to do a movie like this.
Overall, this may just be a guilty pleasure of mine, I know critics hated this one even more than 'Friday the 13th: A New Beginning' which I do not understand at all. If nothing else, this movie is so entertaining and true to the character of Jason you can forgive all the cheesy humor and unnecessary scenes that should have been cut. Watch this movie and have fun, that's what it's for.

133,Rathko,Mediocre Slasher-Trash,5,21 July 2002,"I won't waste time pointing out the 1001 illogical plot holes.  Anyone who goes to see slasher trash expecting logic deserves to get burned.The movie starts out well, with jason held in a secret containment facility after numerous attempts to execute him have failed.  Atmospheric design and some good visuals.  The problems arise when he gets thawed out 450 years in the future on board a spaceship.  Cue 80 minutes of derivative horror sci-fi.  It all slavishly follows every cliché first established so brilliantly by Alien(s) and resurrected in a 1000 straight-to-video titles. We have the cryogenics, the dark, industrial corridors, the gung-ho marines getting wiped out, the corporate guy betraying everyone to make his fortune. All very predictable, but oddly entertaining.  The special effects are surprisingly competent, Isaac's direction better than a special-effects-technician-got-lucky should be.  Lisa Ryder 'going a bit Lara' in black leather is excellent.  But the script is terrible and betrays all the faults of a woefully inept first timer.  Manfredini's music is VERY bad, and incorporates nothing of the classic moody effects he provided for the original.  Even the killings are tame, and have nothing of the splatter shock of the early eighties - blame 90's irony and the need to bring in the lucrative teen market for that one.A bad movie, make no mistake.  It's trash, but it pretends to be nothing more, and is oddly entertaining as a result.  Certainly not worth the price of a cinema ticket, but definitely a good video to rent after a few pints.",Jason X
134,FKDZ,''He's screwed!'',5,25 October 2020,"What a movie this is! Now right of the bat this isn't a good movie in the traditional sense. It's got mediocre acting all around and the writing is as schlocky as you can get, filled with puns, meta, and references. But it's not as obnoxious as it sounds.I actually really enjoyed this movie, more so than a few of the previous ones in the franchise. It's really silly, but in a good way in that it just doesn't care about trying to be serious anymore. This is the kind of refresh I needed after so many failed attempts to try and make the film serious again.So here the plot is basically moved to the future and instead of a camp its a spaceship jason is confined to. The teens/students on there are still the same characters and still as stupid as any other F13 film. The lead is not very memorable not smart either, as she's supposed to be an expert on Jason but never comes with any ideas.The way jason looked in this film was alright, he's definitely looked scaries, but his final form is great, not scary but definitely designed well. Now about Jason, the kills in this movie are pretty good with one of them added to ''most memorable kills'' in my opinion, which is the frozen face kill. It's also the best kill of this movie but overall the kills are good. Noticeably a lot of the actual 'killing'' gets censored but there's always some kind of aftermath that is used or shown in a interesting/fun way.Overall I felt this movie was paced pretty well, I didn't hang around too much and felt much easier to watch. The music is a bit iffy, the main theme comes back here and there but it's definitely not used as well here. The directing was alright, just about interesting enough but they really didn't care about building much suspense or making it seem like jason sneaked around, he kinda just appears everywhere full frame.There are some ridiculous scenes though like jason flying from the explosion in space and the Android doing some insane action moves. Like I said before this film definitely leans heavily into the comedy/crazy than the serious.For me its a 5/10, not terrible like Jason going to Manhattan, but also not even close to F13 part II because Jason just never became scary anymore, nor an attempt was ever made.",Jason X

BUT this isn't TOO bad, their are many, many horror films, Friday the 13th films, and Jason knock-off films that are much worse. Don't get me wrong, Jason X is stupid. I really, really hate all of the characters with a passion, but I did appreciate the unnecessary nudity near the end.There are some good death scenes that continue the tradition that Friday the 13th helped create. This movie basically amounts to ""Friday the 13th Part Ten: Jason in Space"" and since EVERYTHING having to do with space is ALWAYS in the future, (its amazing how everything in outer space is in the future, isn't it? So does that mean the space shuttle time travels?)this is no exception and set in like the 69th century or whatever. Titantic sucks.",Jason X

Usually movies that are up to the third or higher sequels tend to usually stink (ex. Halloween) and others that don't stink (ex. Evil Dead). The movie did something that I wish all movies that are not in the drama categories did: the actors/actresses did not try to act. The ones that did, at least succeded. Their are only a few times when they try and don't succed but it was rare. And to be honest, I thought the special effects were good.

138,Condemned-Soul,Über Jason should have arrived earlier in this so-so slasher,5,8 April 2020,"'Jason X' manages to claw back a bit of dignity from the stench left by its turgid predecessor. Despite the outlandish premise of Jason being revived in space 400 years later, the idea holds promise. Unfortunately it can't capitalise on the claustrophobic possibilities of a serial killer stalking a spaceship's crew members one by one.Bland characters and a cheap, television movie look are prominent setbacks. This tenth entry, despite breaking free from its 1980s violence limitations, is also strangely tame in its kills, with the majority of them taking place offscreen, leaving the audience to view the grisly aftermath instead. No doubt a consequence of its low budget.But despite all the negative points in this science fiction horror, there's a late burst of creativity. Jason Voorhees is dispatched and everyone thinks the threat is over, but due to some futuristic nanotech reconstruction, he is reborn as Über Jason - an undead/cyborg hybrid that looks like something the Nazi's would have made via necromancy in some crazy alternate reality (think the video game Wolfenstein). Seeing this Terminator-styled monster become even more unstoppable adds some much needed energy in the final stretch, making this final film in the franchise a watchable, if lacklustre, instalment.5/10",Jason X
139,shaun98,"Different setting, same routine",4,22 October 2002,"*major spoiler!*It had to happen sooner or later. ""Jason X,"" the tenth installment in the undying ""Friday the 13th"" series puts the masked killer in the 25th century. After being frozen for hundreds of years, he is revived aboard a interstellar craft, where he calmly picks up a machete and goes about his usual work. It sounds like a fan geek's dream, but that doesn't negate the fact that it's a pretty stupid movie. To be honest, it's also kind of dull up till the last act, more on that in a minute. Director James Isaac opens the film with a stylish credit sequence and sets up the story in a fairly interesting way, at least for a slasher. There is even a cameo by cult favorite David Cronenburg. However, as it goes on, it's clear that he has no real sense of pacing, nor does he often demonstrate the ability to scare us. To be fair, that would be hard to do with such flimsy material. It doesn't help that there are a couple of groan-inducing bits regarding severed body parts.The production values are just so-so, betraying its low-budget origins. I would have been much more forgiving in this area if treated to a good story, but it was not to be. The special effects are sometimes adequate, sometimes blatantly fake-looking. I wasn't expecting anything as good as Ridley Scott's ""Alien,"" but at the very least, they should have tried to make it swift and entertaining. The sixth, seventh, and eighth entries were fun to watch in a cheesy sort of way. They were pretty silly, but certainly diverting. ""Jason X"" is just plain bad. However, at least the third act picks up a bit, as an android crewmember apparently finishes the killer off--until he is revived as a cyborg. Still stupid, but more watchable.Needless to say, the acting is mediocre at best, but what could these performers have done with such poor material? At least Kane Hodder, as Jason, seems to be enjoying himself. One cast member in particular is as awful as Carrot Top, but he is thankfully dispatched early on. Lexa Doig, as the heroine, has some appeal, but there wasn't much she could do here. Most of the other actors are ineffectual at best, annoying at worst. I guess most slasher movies will always suffer these faults to a degree. This one certainly doesn't miss an obligation: the door is left open for a sequel.*1/2 (out of ****)Released by New Line Cinema",Jason X

142,el7,Ridiculous. Mostly in a fun way.,6,14 August 2021,"If a horror franchise is allowed to drag out to the double digits then sooner or later the killer is going to space. It's just going to happen. I'm a little disappointed that the Jaws franchise hasn't made it that far yet, I'd have liked to have seen that.This time, it's Jason Voorhees, who gets cryogenically frozen in a cold open set in the present day. At this point the franchise had already established that the authorities recognized Jason as a real unkillable threat, not an urban legend, so it makes sense in-universe that certain unscrupulous people would want to study him to find out how he's avoiding a permanent death. Lexa Doig is great as Rowan, the scientist who determines that the safest way to deal with Jason is to freeze him. Unfortunately due to interference from an opportunistic colleague, she winds up being frozen along with Jason. These sequences are actually pretty decent and don't look too cheap. Fast forward four centuries though, and welcome to some production values that look like an Asylum flick on the Syfy channel. A team of improbably dressed explorers finds the cryochamber, defies all common sense in opening it, and then proceeds to behave in such a reckless manner that someone gets his arm hacked off. This turns out to be a group of teens on a space field trip, being led by an instructor (Jonathan Potts in fine smarmy form) who turns out to be more interested in making a few bucks on the side than in their educational welfare. They take both Rowan and Jason aboard their laboratory vessel and just as soon as two of the teens frolic off to get busy, the whole ship is in trouble. The rest of the film is Rowan, the students, crew and their space marine escort trying to first contain Jason, and failing that, escape from the ship as it falls apart. Kind of like one of the more recent Alien movies, except it's Jason and the special effects are sometimes hilariously special. There's a lot of live ammo being fired in confined spaces, which seems like a really bad idea in a space ship. Then there's an Aeon Flux inspired sequence, which the actress (Lisa Ryder) carries off with winky aplomb. Peter Mensah is also great as the redoubtable Sergeant Brodski. Overall, this is one of the weaker entries in the series, but it's got a lot of cheese appeal. It's definitely worth at least one watch.",Jason X
143,boyinflares,Space Camp? Not Quite,5,16 July 2005,"One of the aspects of this film that contributed to its awful-ness was the large cast, many of which get only a moment of screen time, many of them look similar to others, and it is hard to keep track of who is who, until nearly everyone dies and you are left with a final few.The premise is rather silly too, while it was another attempt at taking Jason out of Crystal Lake, taking him to space, of all places, not to mention it being set years ahead in the future, was rather painful, to the viewer (as well as the characters in this film). I believe that the premise of the Friday the 13th films, set at Crystal Lake, is what makes the Friday the 13th films so cool.The cast are, like many other Friday films, all Jason-fodder, and while there are a varying degree of personalities, most get so little screen time they are utterly forgettable, with the notable exception of Lexa Doig, who gives a terrific performance.Overall, this movie is worth a watch, but unlike other Friday the 13th films, it's one that you may only want to watch once.",Jason X
144,chucknorrisfacts,Horrible!,1,21 October 2007,"With a plot outline that reads: ""Jason Voorhees returns with a new look, a new machete, and his same murderous attitude as he is awakened on a spaceship in the 25th century."" Do you really expect this to be any good? I sure hope not. This is easily one of the worst, if not the worst sequel in ""Friday the 13th"" franchise history. Who thinks this stuff up, honestly? How could sending Jason into space ever seem like a good idea? Not to mention the mere fact it takes place after the events of ""Freddy versus Jason"" really takes the surprise out of whether or not Jason loses in that movie. Which is too bad too, because ""Freddy versus Jason"" looks like ""Lawrence of Arabia"" next to this piece of garbage.The most ridiculous part is when ""evil gets an upgrade"" as the tagline so ridiculously puts it. Come on, this isn't necessary. Just because a ""Friday"" film is set in the future doesn't mean Jason has to change with the times, in fact he should be the only constant. It shouldn't matter what generation Jason is in, he should be able to be just as dangerous and effective a killing machine regardless of what he's wearing.This movie is guilty of countless crimes against the cinema. How this project ever got the green light is a complete and total mystery to me. At least when I saw it, someone else rented it, so I didn't have to spend my own money on it. Overall, I'd say this is not worth the rental, and it's barely worth watching even on television for free! It is an insult to the intelligent horror film fan.",Jason X

As with any movie series with 10 parts, it cannot and must not be taken seriously. The story for Jason X is as ridiculous as they come. Mass murderer Jason Voorhees is cryogenically frozen for 500 years from now when he comes back to life on a spaceship heading for Earth 2. Aside from the stomach churning acting in the film there are a few scenes that are worth watching. If you rent this film on DVD just go to the Jump To A Death feature to watch the hilarious killings that take place. Aside from the cool new upgrade Jason gets (to become Uber-Jason), this film is totally unmemorable. I would not recommend watching this film all the way through, it is not worth anyone's time.",Jason X
146,jed-estes,A Film To Live By 9,10,26 August 2006,"Jason X was a fine way to reintroduce the master of slaughter to the younger naive generation. But it backfired as the film ended up becoming a joke to most and a celebration to few. This could in part be because we were tantalized for years about the proposed Freddy vs Jason and by this point it was what we wanted. Another reason this failed at the box office is because it had been a decade since Jason last stalked his game, and the world had moved on, that's a sad thought. I myself love this movie and could watch it non-stop but then again I am biased as I love the character and the story, I could see if you were not a fan or if you were a fan and expecting more, that this would not be your cup of tea. But to those who only think of this film as joke, you are wrong. This film had lots of heart and took a heck of a long walk to get to screen, the battle that this film had to through to get shown should be made into a movie it was so wicked. Studio Execs leaving, people feeling Jason was not worthy to return, stupid people, and the internet were all causes for this film to be halted, but it prevailed and was shown and I think thirty million is not a bad number for a film that was not properly released or advertised. In the end this film came out swinging and was beautiful, it was the first Jason film I saw in the theater and I was elated. This is far better than Ronny Yu's soiled down Freddy vs Jason that would come a year later. or three years later if you count the fact that Jason X sit on a self at New Line for three years. I wonder how long it will take them to release the new Michael Bay produced remake once completed. My gut says it will go out quickly and be targeted at ignorant people and sell quick thus ruining the integrity that is and forever shall be Jason. See Jason X it well worth it and if you look at it, it is a fine conclusion to the chronicles of The Crystal Lake Slasher.",Jason X

I do like how they just kind of gave up and made the characters say stupidly hilarious things, but it loses all those points from the abhorrent CGI, awful acting, idiotic characters, and an overall ridiculous plot. (Seriously though, they gave up big time. Like they didn't try at all).

So does the movie get a pass? Is it a so bad it's good movie?There are definitely moments that are too silly even when you suspend your disbelief. As the plot moves forward the movie becomes more over-the-top and unbelievable.However I liked the attempt to create something new. The mix of a horror icon with Sci-Fi. There were a lot of funny and scary scenes. I liked how the movie doesn't take itself seriously and the characters have corny jokes and one liners. Some of the scenes with Jason were scary and I also liked the futuristic environment used for survival. It was an interesting dimension to a slasher movie.So even though it isn't the most memorable horror movie it was still entertaining.,Jason X
152,Caps Fan,Too insipid to hate,2,2 February 2008,"Well, you don't watch a film in the ""Friday the 13th"" series expecting logic, sense, or high production values. But if you like slasher films (as I do!) you do expect a measure of gory fun.Jason X, unfortunately, provides that only up to a point. Though some of the killings shown are imaginative, others are so casually, even carelessly, presented, that you're left saying ""Huh?"" rather than screaming in terror (or laughter). My favorite in this respect: when the soldier Sven is yanked backward and has his neck broken, the two highly trained (LOL) soldiers with him don't even notice for several minutes. When they do, one asks ""Where the hell's Sven?"" - and that's that. No attempt is made to find/contact him or avenge his death. If the characters don't care, why should the audience?Special effects, which might have redeemed this, are poor and the movie otherwise has all the flaws of the genre  idiotic plot, characters who are any or all of stupid/greedy/venal, and a villain who is improbable  nay, impossible  to say the least. The music is so pallid that they might as well not have bothered with any.If you're a fan of the series, you might enjoy this. Otherwise, forget it.Rating: 2/10.",Jason X

The reason the first four Fridays were scary was because they actually attempted to take themselves seriously, they didn't try to be funny and they didn't use corny one-liners - comedy has no business in a horror film. This latest entry is one of the worst (although 8 & 9 were also very bad). There are so many, many movies about space - why did director James Isaac choose to make a Friday the 13th film if his real inspiration was the ""Alien"" movies. I actually found myself yawning throughout this film and did not find one single scene to be scary. It wasn't scary, it wasn't gross (one gross killing out of 30 is not enough) - it wasn't good. I hope if New Line decides to put out a new Friday film, they will put Jason back in the woods where he belongs and where he is scary, and give him back his old look of hockey mask and dirty farm clothing - the Uber-Jason at the end of the film looked much more like a comic book villain than a serial killer.",Jason X
158,legendaryunderdog,New Line Cinema is destroying Jason's character,2,27 September 2007,"New Line's acquisition of the Jason Voorhees name, trademark, what-have-you have proved to be a big mistake in my opinion. Between Jason Goes to Hell and Jason X (both New Line products) these two movies are a horribly naive attempt to cash in on a new idea of what a Jason/ Friday the 13th movie should be like in the modern world of today. Jason Goes to Hell was the better of the two but this movie (Jason X) was just utterly horrible. The characters are still composed of the traditional sex-crazed teenagers, with some adult authority kicking around. The new 'space-craze' phenomenon sucked in the Jason/Friday the 13th series and for some reason the director (whose name escapes me right now) must have had a perverse look at what it would be like in the year 2455. This is Flash Gordon meets Jason Voorhees type material, really pathetic. There is no time for character development at all, they die off too quickly for starts. The guy with his own personal robot was a little too icky for me, the sex-crazed couple, the corrupted leader who has his own issues with bondage. There is simply way too much stuff going on that doesn't need to be going on, big time although 'cheesy' special f/x and horrible dialogue really make for the most of the movie. Jason's appearance is still grotesque as always, there is the nutcase (supposedly) that knows of the Jason legend (sounds like Crazy Ralph to me) and then the new invention of the regeneration of dead tissue? C'mon! Jason is the only reason for seeing this, you probably already knew that. Good luck sitting through it!",Jason X

The actors are horrible, the teenagers are stupid, and Jason is in rare form, even though he has been frozen for like 2,000 years. They have really taken this franchise as far as it can go, but I hope that they take it further.  They should go every other, like one crazy sci fi Jason film followed by one set in the present day.

161,Colbridge,"A smartly made, witty and inventive sequel",5,11 November 2021,"A Friday the 13th movie set 400 years into the future which takes place in outer space, ludicrous right? Well you'd think so but this scenario actually works in Jason X, the tenth instalment of the Friday the 13th franchise and the second to be released by New Line Cinema after the debacle that was Jason Goes to Hell (1993) which promised to be the Final Friday, but of course it wasn't.Thanks to a witty script by Todd Farmer and smart direction by James Isaac this is an enjoyable sci-fi horror action movie and a welcome change to see Jason in a different setting. It delivers some inventive kills, is funny where it's supposed to be and is not as bad as some reviewers would have you believe. In fact I avoided watching this for almost 20 years as I thought the filmmakers had gone too far in a desperate attempt to keep the franchise going, I was pleasantly surprised to see just how good it was, even 20 years on.Produced by original Friday the 13th creator Sean S Cunningham with his son Noel Cunningham the gamble to put Jason Voorhees into space paid off, probably because this is for all intents and purposes Alien (1979), but instead of HR Giger's creature jumping out and killing the crew it's the unstoppable Jason who terrorises the spaceship. Played once again to good effect by Kane Hodder the serial killer gets a cool makeover when he's regenerated by nano technology after being cryogenically frozen since 2008 in an attempt to contain the killer.Jason X has the highest budget of all the Friday the 13th movies costing $11 million due largely to it's digital effects, where the average Friday movie would cost around $3 million. Not faring well at the box office upon it's release it's certainly worth a revisit and a reappraisal.Look out for an appearance by legendary horror film director David Cronenberg who, as Dr. Wimmer, holds Jason captive in the Crystal Lake Research Facility before he inevitably escapes.",Jason X

Part 7 was ""whatta hell is this TV-crap?"" with a hilarious sleeping-bag execution, part 8 would have been OK if they wouldn't have been so shy with the gore and part 9 was just OK, with even some sight. I don't mind having a part 10 after ""Jason goes to hell"". I don't mind with the far-fetched plot here. I even don't mind tampering with Jason's outfit. What I DO mind here are these 2 things:-The actors seem to be reading their lines straight out of off-screen cards not even trying to act, which is uncomfortable and annoying. SHAME ON YOU!-The director DOESN'T EVEN TRY!!It all looks like bad cable stuff (even more worse than part 7!!) with NO kind of sense about lighting, cameras always at a distance from actor's faces (no close-ups), no creativity, no gimmicks... makes me wonder if there even WAS a director!? And the funny thing is, the ""director"" can't even blame the studio, 'cause he had a budget and obviously green light for gore and (even) nudity!Ain't nothing ever going to explain this mess.

165,jake-179,X-TREMELY GOOD!,10,1 March 2004,"I loved this movie.  In my opinion, this is the best of the JASON movies. Jason in space?  What a great concept!  This movie combined two of my favorite genres, horror and science fiction.  The movie delivers on all counts.  It has a great story line, and terrific special effects.  The movie is non-stop action and the killings are very creative.  This movie is very gorey, and in fact, I would say it is the most gorey installment of the FRIDAY THE 13th movies so far.  And without a doubt, this is the funniest movie of the series.  It has some really great laughs.  The director definitely seems to have a well developed sense of humor and a true love of action, horror, and sci fi.  This movie is awesome.  I loved the part when the space ship crashes in to the space station and then the space station explodes.  Also the part when the grunt gets cut in half and the next shot you see is the poor guy dragging half his body across the floor.
The characters are all likable and memorable.  Not to mention, this installment of the series definitely has the HOTTEST girls.  There are not too many other movies in general to come to my mind that have women of this calibre.In particular, I have to mention Melody Johnson.  She played the character ""Kinsa.""  I think she is absolutely gorgeous.  A modern day screamer-movie beauty.  She is incredibly sexy throughout the movie.  She kind of looks like Anna Paqin, but I think Melody is better looking.  She is just exactly my type.  I own JASON X on DVD and I put it in every once in a while just to check out Melody Johnson.  It seems unfortunate to me that Melody has not really done too many other movies.  She is so beautiful I would like to see more of her...A LOT more of her!If you are a fan of FRIDAY THE 13th, or just a sci fi or horror fan, you absolutely have to see JASON X.  The hologram sequence at the end where the ""upgraded"" Jason returns to Crystal Lake and encounters HOT co-eds is priceless.  The two girls offer Jason beer and pot, and then exclaim ""We love premarital sex.""  Then Jason beats them to death by wrapping them up in their sleeping bags and smashing them into a tree.  Its creepy, violent, and super funny all at the same time.You really have to see this movie.  It is top notch from start to finish. Check it out and you will not be disappointed, you will be thoroughly entertained.",Jason X
166,misbegotten,A hugely entertaining blend of science-fiction and horror,9,28 September 2008,"I'm not really a fan of the Friday the 13th movies - in fact, I consider the first five films to be interchangeable, almost instantly forgettable, and pretty worthless. However, from Friday the 13th Part 6: Jason Lives onwards everything starts to improve, and in my opinion it must be the only long-running movie series that actually gets better as it goes along.Jason X is my favourite film in the series: it works on all levels, as a slasher film, as a science-fiction movie, and as an action thriller. Just as the preceding entry Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday (which I also enjoyed) was a celebration of the '80s horror genre, with nods and winks to Halloween, the Nightmare on Elm Street series, The Evil Dead, The Thing, etc, so Jason X cheerfully includes elements from numerous sci-fi action movies, such as Aliens, The Terminator, Virtuosity, The Lawnmower Man, Robocop, and Predator. But it doesn't do so to rip those films off. Instead, the producers simply know that if you put Jason in a future setting, movie-savvy audiences are going to be annoyed if he doesn't encounter such sci-fi standards as androids, virtual reality, nano-technology, cyborgs, and space-marines.The producers even have the courage to play Jason for laughs towards the end of the film, as Kay-Em 14 takes him to pieces (a terrific sequence!!!), plus the hologram scene where he's confronted by two hilariously stereotypical topless cuties. But the film never tips over into farce, and successfully ensures that Jason remains as menacing and lethal as ever.Full marks also to the writers and cast, for making the various potential Jason fodder candidates amongst the most well-rounded individuals in the series. One complaint often made against Jason X is that it lacks a strong Final Girl, but I think that's merely because so many of the characters register so strongly.",Jason X
167,Insomniac_moviefan,Jason in all his glory. Dedicated only to fans.,10,1 November 2002,"Let the bodies hit the floor!Jason is back and there's no possible way that he's returning to hell. ""JASON X"" is a great sequel. I'm a die hard fan of the Friday the 13th movies, and other fans have to agree that this movie rocks because it's all about Jason. And now way he's a sell out unlike other villians... Jason Voorhees returns and now the devil has something to fear.
For example, pretend it's your birthday and you are 8 years old. It's your day, and everything it's only for you : the clown, presents, the cake, everything. Your parents pay for a birthday party with the purpose that you will have more fun that the others. JASON X is the same case. The fans pay to see JASON doing his favorite thing : slashing dumb teens and anyone that gets on his way. Fans complained in JASON GOES TO HELL because there wasn't enough Jason, and in JASON X we get Jason all the time! Besides we get PLENTY of gore, creative death scenes, a very very PI**ED off Jason, hot chicks, a cool setting, even a good score.THE OLD DAYS... In some moments, the feeling inside the previous Friday the 13th movies was present. The creepy atmosphere, the ""ki ki ki"" and Jason looking mean brought some old memories. *MINOR SPOILERS* All of the death scenes show that Jason hates any living thing, and this time around he has no compassion for anyone unlike in previous films. Oh no, Jason shows no mercy. His machete had a lot of work in this one. The VR Camp Crystal lake setting is pure gold! It shows Jason in all of his glory. Those were the days where Jason would slash anyone around his territory. The death scenes, the score, the direction (which I must say is pretty good) and of course Jason brought the Friday the 13th style back. -END OF SPOILERS-THE NEW FRIDAY THE 13th Ok, maybe the plot is kind of (!) cheesy but the series needed a new story. The film has lots of black humor and this is why some people think that it's a cheesy film in general. Sometimes the humor is necessary to break tension.Overall, this is a good slasher and it's because there's Jason Voorhees. This is a movie to add proudly to the Friday series, and that's it. It won't change future plots, and it won't change Jason's fate. This is a reward for all the die hard fans that waited to see Jason lifting his machette again.Yes, we waited 9 years for this movie to happen, and I'm proud to say that the wait was worth. JASON X will be followed by  FREDDY V.S. JASON next summer. Movie in which Jason Voorhees will kick some seriously Freddy's ass!

I mean why not Pinhead, Predator and Leprechaun were in space so lets explode Kane Hodder to the outer regions of experience.

That said, this is one of those rare sequels that's much better than the original. In fact, this movie is light-years better than all the others in the franchise. Why? Because this is the first ""Friday the 13th"" movie that finally figured out what everyone else already knew, ""You know what? We're not producing an Oscar-winner here, so let's just have fun with it and see what develops."" For example, Jason has Rowan (Lexa Doig) and two of her shipmates trapped in a sealed-off corner of the spaceship and is about to go in for the kill. That is, until Tsunaron strolls in behind Jason with a turbo-powered Kay-Em and gets Jason's attention by shouting, ""HEY SLAPPY!!!"" I was rolling on the floor laughing! The last thing I would think of saying to a homicidal maniac who's about to slice and dice me is, ""Hey Slappy!"" Yet that's what makes this movie so entertaining. People are about to be chopped into bits, and they're cracking jokes to get through their misery. You have two Virtual Reality Girls -- part of a throwback scene as the crew tries to divert Jason -- watching 'Ol Hockey Mask make a beeline toward them with his machete, and instead of running and screaming they ask him if he'd like to smoke some pot, take off their shirts and just stand there topless for him. And unlike earlier ""Friday the 13th"" movies, where you feel like the director would throw a punch at you in anger if you laughed during the movie, here you get a vibe that the folks who put together ""Jason X"" want you to laugh just as much as they want you to be scared. It's almost as much a dark comedy as it is a horror movie. Of course, the girls are the other great thing about this movie. Lexa Doig is HOT, Kay-Em is the hottest android around, Gekko (one of the commando grunts who got her neck slashed about halfway through the movie) is hot and most of the other girls in this movie are good-looking. Even the two Virtual Reality girls were hotties. They somehow made '80s hairstyles look good again. I wouldn't give any other ""Friday the 13th"" movies -- except MAYBE ""Freddy vs. Jason"" -- higher than a 4, and most quite frankly deserve a 1 even if you're simply watching them for the gore value. But ""Jason X"" is worthy of a solid 7. Probably the best movie ever made in the homicidal-maniac family of horror movies.",Jason X
173,EdYerkeRobins,"What, You Were Expecting An Art-house Classic?!",6,30 April 2002,"Ten movies.  Twenty-two years.  The unstoppable, hockey-masked being known as Jason Voorhees seems to have come a long way.  His greatest previous venture had him in Manhattan, but now he has gone to that special place where all horror franchises go to die  space.  Disregarding the fact that Jason went to Hell in the last film and the well-known fact that there has NEVER been a good franchise film set in space (ever), New Line Cinema green-lighted ""Jason X"", which promises and delivers nothing new, proving that the more things change, the more things stay the same.	Set in 2455 on the space-ship Grendel, the film shows that in the future, female scientists are all teenagers that have been genetically engineered to look super-attractive and wear clothes that would make the primitive woman of today yell, ""Scandalous!"" Apparently, said genetic engineering has also kept said teenage ""scientists"" as dumb and horny as ever.  The only sensible one (male or female) of the lot is Rowan, the obvious heroine (obvious because she is still alive after the first half hour) who's been cryogenically frozen along with Jason for over 450 years, and has the most practical knowledge on how to deal with Jason (even though that knowledge is limited to, ""He can't be killed!"" and ""Run!"") and the many mishaps that always occur with advanced technology when tragedy strikes.	Jason has pretty much remained the same.  As in ""Jason Goes to Hell"" (the other New Line Friday the 13th Film), there have been slight changes, but it's still the same old big guy with a hatchet and a hockey mask.  The much touted ""upgrade"" to uber-mecha-Jason that occurs near the end is really more of a laugh than anything else, as he doesn't look scary, or even that sleek, just a bit goofier with a metal mask and red contacts.  Although he gets a couple unique killings, the majority of his kills still remain the same, hacked with his trademark machete or over-powered and crushed with his inhuman strength.  The film's best kill is one of the earliest, and one of the film's funniest moments of Jason violence occurs about ten minutes into the movie, thus showing that the producers of ""Jason X"" have no problem blowing their load early to insure that nobody walks out.	Those two killings would be the only reason to stay if other parts of the movie weren't so funny.  The comic relief character (who looks suspiciously like Carrot Top), as is usually the case with comic relief characters, isn't funny on his own, so the producers make him funny (a rare accomplishment), by subjecting him to the second-funniest moment of Jason violence (committed while still frozen solid!) early on in the film.  The film's funniest moment occurs near the end, and, without giving it away, Jason meets images from his past with hilarious results.  In addition to the intentional humor, there is the unintentional humor from all the bad CGI (mainly in several ""explosions"" that take place in space outside the Grendel) and ludicrous (even for the genre and series) plot developments.  There are even some simple math errors in the dialogue because of the film's constant changes in release dates over the past couple years.	Were it not for the humor, ""Jason X"" would be disappointing and unwatchable.  As it is, it's still disappointing, with some very entertaining cheesy moments, but who would expect anything more out of a Friday the 13th film or a horror franchise ""in space"" film? Fans of the series will no doubt enjoy this, and the best moments are amusing enough that the film's not a total waste of time and talent, but this just proves (along with ""Jason Goes to Hell"") that Jason Voorhees is just another 80s pop icon that is good for nostalgia or parody every so often but completely falls apart when resurrected for a new generation.",Jason X
174,ichabod81,Dumb and kinda fun.,6,10 June 2003,"First, I haven't seen parts 3-9, but soon after starting Jason X I realized that it didn't matter. It's just more of the same. The makers of this movie take pride on how creative Vorhees is in the way he offs people. I don't agree. There are couple of inventive kills (""he's screwed.""), but most of them are just boring stabings and so on. I just want to add that I do know that this is a camp quality movie, but I still was a little disappointed 'cause I didn't find it that funny. Maybe it's just that I don't consider Jason to be as interesting and cool bad guy as, say Krueger and Myers.

Never again am I going to pay to see crap like this.I rented Jason X fully aware of the fact that it´s a stupid ""horror"" movie. I just thought I might take it as a comedy and that way it could be entertaining. I was so wrong. Jason X is a horrible movie and it´s not even scary. You know those Teletubbies? Now those guys are really scary! In one of my nightmares I run into them on a dark street and then I wake up screaming. But this Jason Voorhees does nothing to me. A 5-year old kid would be scared of him, but come on, the whole Jason myth is just plain stupid. How many times has he been killed? Some weirdos seem to get their kicks watching Jason slaughtering young people, but any normal human being should find it sick. The whole Friday the 13th series just shows that all that the film makers want is just money from the freak fans who obviously exist. I believe this was the 10th movie in the series and I´ve read that all the parts are all the same: Jason somehow comes back to life and starts killing. This just goes out to prove the stupidity of people and film makers.Jason X should be buried as deep as possible and left there. On the other hand the movie is such waste that it  might not even decay. Still, it´s our job to take care of the garbage so that the next generations don´t have to suffer the way we did.As a final note I´d like to say that someone please kill that goddamn Jason or put all the film makers responsible behind the bars.",Jason X

Jason gets cryogenicly frozen for 450 years and wakes up on generic future space ship #262, from there he kills, kills again and kills some more and it is so funny. The killings are so over the top. Jason grabs a girls head, sticks it liquid nitrogen and bashes her head on a table where it just explodes. Now that is cool. Even Jasons supposed death at the hand of android (its the future, of course this film was going to have an android)Key-Em 14 is incredibly overdone as she basically dissects him with a shotgun (Lisa Ryder is super hot doing it as well). Oh, and there's a scene including two naked girls, Jason and sleeping bags, its got to be one of the funniest scenes to ever be included in a horror movie.Jasons upgrade near the end of the film is just the definition of Bad- Ass. The mask, the red eyes, its all uber awesome (in the credits they call Jasons upgrade Uber-Jason). Kane Hodder as Jason is incredible, the stare with those red eyes is actually terrifying.Jason X is fun, big, dumb, incredibly stupid fun.

It's kinda weird, but, this movie simply rocks.  I've been a big fan of Jason Voorhees for a while and I enjoyed all of the films (including ""Jason Goes To Hell: The Final Friday""), and this one is no exception.  The movie is so violent.

Do that for twentieth film in the franchise, if you can make it up to that point.Bad : After the events of Final Friday, the existence of this garbage isn't justified. We get everything 2001-ish except for that stupid sci-fi mumbo jumbo with the lab technicians (or whatever) dressed up like strippers and looking like cheap sex workers, that makes no sense at all. You can heal a 400 year old fossil but not someone who died just now? May be the movie explains it, and I might have snoozed at the very moment. But who cares? This movie is already nonsensical. There are some stupid references of the movie being in 2455 or whatever, and has some high tech weapons made of plastic to take out Jason. And, all the other negatives are exactly those of Part 8, in fact this is part 8, but in space - no good characters, no storyline, no logic, takes itself too seriously and absolutely sucks. This feels like a crossover between Power Rangers and the Doom Game, with Jason. It feels incredibly dragged and is also a pseudo pornography. If someone says he/she hates sci-fi, he/she might have watched this movie. None of the characters are interesting. It sucks out all the life you have and makes you die of dehydration. I am really tired of watching this garbage, and I don't want to whine about this anymore.Conclusion : It was perhaps the worst idea, assuming that there were ideas that were introduced for this movie, for this movie.

I like that they did something really new to the series and made it had a space like 80's feel to the original Friday the 13th.The death scenes were great and invented to give JASON more space than that campground.And that short new look at what JASON is going to look like is brilliant.Kane Hodder is JASON and forever will be.So a great installment to the series.Really it is.",Jason X

A spaceship (that is filled with horny teens, just like every were else Jason goes.) finds a woman named Rowan, and Jason freaking Voorhees himself, frozen on a dying Earth. They then thaw out them both and Jason goes around killing everyone on the ship. Kinda like Alien, only not good. The acting is absolutely terrible. It's boring and unbelievable. The only good actor in this movie is Kane Hodder, he always does good the Hocky mask wearing and machete wielding, psychopath that we have all come to love. The only thing memorable in this movie is that Jason ends up getting blown in to pieces by a robot woman, and then these creatures called Ann's come out and turn him into the Cyborg-Pycho known as Uber-Jason.

I do hope that Freddy Vs. Jason goes into this and maybe leads up to Jason X so that we can see what happens here and why we have what we got. Ok, maybe all films do not have to follow each other, look at ""The Creature From The Black Lagoon"" He was shot and came back, they put him in a zoo, and then tried to make him more human by socializing him. All movie monsters, and that is what Jason is, going from a person who wanted revenge for the death of his mother, who was revenging his death, Or so she thought he was dead, just sorta turned to a monster, who unlike Freddy, who kills teens for thier parents sins, or Frankenstiens Monster,who kills because he is made fun of, lives to kill, anybody, not just teenagers anymore, he kills everybody.

What else would I want?,3,6 March 2003,"When I saw Jason X and I told people afterwards that I thought it sucked on ice, people usually say back, ""Geez, what did you expect?"" Well, like I said above I expected it to be good.There is a school of thought in horror fan circles that the Friday the 13th series is all crap; Horror of the lowest common demoniator. That's probably true, but there are fun moments to be had here in there over the course of the series's run. Parts 1-3 make a good little trilogy. With Parts 6, 8, and 9 all having their moments.Frankly, I was looking forward to seeing Jason X since it was the first of the series since the Scream movies made all things with slashers ironic. This could have been a good chance to make a straightforward, bloody, trashy film; A kind of celebration for a franchise that has lasted ten chapters.Instead, the movie just kind of limps along with not much to do. I will be probably the only person the world who won't fault the movie for it's admittidly stupid space concept (Anyone remember Hellraiser: Bloodline? Well, I liked that one). And I even thought the way they managed to get Jason into the future was ok. But once he got up and started walking around, the movie just didn't go for me. I think it had something to do with the AWFUL set designs which reminded me of the MST3K classic ""Space Mutiny,"" where the railing and walkway filled sets made it impossible to tell where any character was in relationship to any of the others. Here, endless time is spend while victims stumbled around in search of things to point their guns or breasts at. And that throwaway joke at the end about the holographic campers made me chuckle at the time, but now seems kind of like a cheap shot.What did I like? Kane Hodder is menacing as Jason; The part where the girl gets her face shattered is a corker; The ""screwed"" moment is OK; The ""enhanced"" Jason was a nice try; And I liked the gun-toting android woman (She's the only actress here who seems to get the point).But the rest of Jason X is just thrown together slop that doesn't do enough to suck up to people like me, who have stood up for this series in it's lamest moments.",Jason X

You still know that in this kind of movie what is important is the lousy actresses, brainless and absolutely teenagely gorgeous. Well having this in mind, you might as well have one hell of a KILLING time.
Now, to be honest, when I heard that the movie i was about to see here in Spain was the director's cut and that the movie was being cut in the US for a theatrical release, I thought I was about to see something really good in extreme, but nooooo. All I saw was the average blood and killings as the rest of the saga. But, and this is important, this time the body count is higher, and some of the killing were some of the most innovative in the whole series (i wont say which ones not to spoil it for you).
The production was quite low budget, and still it manages to work well with what it had, some of the special effects were average, some lousily bad and some good. But when the time of kick butt came for the gorgeous she-android...believe me, it was worth the wait. Besides, there was something in the environment, the fact of seeing jason with a new machete-like cutting device, the uber-jason, the claustrophobic tunnels, the virtual crystal lake, and the bad acted screams, that are priceless for a horror fan like myself.Perhaps this one wont be at the horror hall of fame, and I don't really care.

195,Duzniak38,Jason In Space,10,4 August 2006,"Jason X is mind-numbing. It is awful. Perhaps the worst in the series. There is hardly anything redeeming about it. Jason X sees Jason tricked into being cryogenicly frozen by a woman called Rowan who is also frozen along with him. They are then unfrozen in the year 2455 aboard a spaceship full of naive teenagers on a trip. These teens, along with an older teacher, explain that Earth has been destroyed and tell Rowan that they are currently dissecting Jason etc. Rowan knows of Jason's murderous ways and tells them that they don't know what they're doing etc. but in the usual clichéd way they think they know what they're doing, until it's too late, and Jason is dismembering limbs here, there and everywhere. Jason X really hits rock bottom. It's storyline is completely unappealing and seems strewn together very loosely. There is no mention of any of the usual roots of the Friday the 13th movie; there is no Camp Crystal Lake and no camp counsellors, so why does Jason feel the need to kill everyone off aboard the ship, if they have done nothing in the first place. Well, the reason seems to be that Jason gets agitated by sexual activities, and skimpy-clothed big breasted woman, so he stalks around the ship killing off everyone in rage. Boring. The gore is completely unsatisfactory, save for an interesting scene where Adrienne has her face cryogenicly frozen in a sink, and smashed to pieces on the table, leaving her with no face. The script is completely wrong, and the acting is just plain unconvincing. The one one redeeming feature is the rather stylish sets, which look super cool and sexy.

I also think the tone and atmosphere is okay but not as good as previous installments. The movie fails at a lot of things though. First almost every character is unlikeable and the actors phone in their performances more than I would like. The CGI is also awful they should've gone as practical as possible and removed a lot of the bad effects in the film. The plot is also worse than a lot of the rest of the films in the series.

Anyway, you can probably guess that Jason is back to his old ways and now the people on the ship have to battle him. In space. Wow. There are so many things wrong with this movie, but I guess I should have expected that when I bought a movie about Jason in space. The acting was non-existent and the plot, well, there really was none. The students (and professor) aboard the ship seem to have sex every five minutes, even the ship's android is involved in a few ""steamy"" scenes. I don't think I've ever laughed so hard in my life, though. It was an EXTREMELY funny movie, and is guaranteed to have you laughing like crazy throughout.

200,tloader-1,"Original, fun and great kills!",7,1 October 2021,"This is more original and interesting than most of the sequels, and adds a sense of fun the others have lacked.The effects look great and the kills are original and gory as you would expect for a Friday film.Downsides are the overall campiness, appalling acting and distracting music.Not as bad as the reviews here would have you believe.",Jason X
201,bramb600,How do these movies keep getting worse and worse?,3,16 June 2009,"Yes, Part 9 was crap and it was supposed to be the last one and maybe it was the last Friday film if you can even call it that. This movie was only made as a quick cash grab, which just ended up being a flop anyway. The movie really bad too as awesome as the idea of Jason Voorhees in space should be.At least Kane Hodder is back as Jason, so that's a little bit of credit because he happens to be the coolest one to play the serial killer. Still in Jason X, he brings almost nothing to the movie.Pretty much, Jason comes back to life, in space this time, and he attacks, then is frozen. He is thawed in the year 2455, by plenty of attractive twenty-something astronauts. Eventually, he'll be picking em' off one by one until there's no more left and that's expected of him.The issue here is that we never even care about the characters for a second. No one is that likable because there was almost no character building. It's shocking that the characters even have names rather than just Girl #1, Boy #1. When they die, maybe we can say that it was a pretty cool kill but we really never feel for the characters that it's at all important to us when that happens.Another obvious problem with the movie is special effects. You would think that a movie set in space would have great special effects, especially considered what was available to them in the early 2000's. Everything in here looks fake especially all the outer space scenes.I also wanted to mention that it's crazy that the hockey mask pretty much changes in every film and in this film it is very round shaped and looks really ridiculous. It's strange to nitpick tiny things like the shape of the mask but it looks odd compared to the other great ones and a lot less scary. When he turns into the cyborg Jason, it's definitely a much better look for him as he is powerful, but it still isn't that scary. I can honestly say that I never jumped while watching this and it was an epic waste of time.",Jason X

The first one is a girl and the other one is a serial killer called Jason Voorhees which is very danger and they try to stop him.The acting is mediocre in this horror-film. It is also a very cool and a well-done horror-movie, because it up in the space. You can also see very brutal and bloody special-effects.Jason Voorhees is very cool in his mask and he which act Jason is a very good actor.Recommended!",Jason X

204,droogiedim77,what is this god-awful mess?,1,15 July 2003,"I love Friday the 13th. The first three are amazing. It seems like after that, the producers tried to suck harder with each subsequent film. The last three films (parts 8,9 and 10) are beyond awful in description. What's amazing is you didnt think they could make a film worse than Jason takes Manhattan, and they did. You watch Jason Goes to Hell and your first thought is ""That is such a blatant rip-off of The Hidden, it should be called plagarism."" and then you think ""Well, they couldn't possibly make a movie worse than part 9."" then Jason X comes out. Not only is this one of the worst movies ever made, the crew touted it has the best script ever. I would like to see what script they were reading, because someone must have pulled the switcheroo on them when they started filming. This film is not only horrible on every single possible level, it is pointless and has no redeeming values. This isnt even a film thats so bad, you can laugh and enjoy it. This film is so bad, when you're done you want to physically harm those who wrote, directed, and produced. i haven't seen this much harm done to a franchise since Batman & Robin....and this is actually worse, if you can believe it. At least Batman & Robin was just one film....we Friday the 13th fans have dealt with three atrocities in a row. I have hope for Freddy vs. Jason...and I really don't think you can make a worse film than Jason X, but I'm sure the producers will surprise me with the next Jason-only friday film.",Jason X

It's Great To See The Infamous Jason Voorhees Go On His Usual Killing Spree and Madness. Starts Off With Jason About To Get Frozen, But Escapes and Kills Off The Government Officials Who Are About To Freeze Him. From There, He Eventually Gets Frozen, But Takes A Victim With Him and Spend The Next 400 Years Frozen and Earth Becomes A Vast Wasteland. From There, The Victim and Jason Get Thawed Out and The Mayhem and Killing Begin. At One Point, Jason Is Vanquished But Gets Upgraded With A New Mask and Tricked Out Machete and Keeps Bring On The Pain. The Ending Is A Lame One and I'll Just Leave It At That.The Actors Were Not All Into The Story, Except Kane Hodder Who Plays Jason For The Fourth Time In This Movie; The Story Was Far-fetched to Send One Of Horror's Great Icons Into Space; But For What This Movie Is Worth, It's Not A Bad Film.

But, I was surprised...they did a great job with this movie. What saved the movie was that when the movie moved from present time to the future, no one tried to make the future time setting into a crazy Star Trek type setting. Everyone still acted the same & in many ways, it was still like a old Friday movie. Decent direction & writing make this movie enjoyable for fans & other movie goers. When Jason is frozen at a cryo-facility (since he can't really be killed), his body & a female's are discovered over 400 years later by a scientific expedition team. (Earth is no longer inhabitated, since it has become a 'dead' planet). But when the two are brought onboard the space vessel, it is too late. Before the female can warn the others about Jason, he thaws out & wrecks havoc on the ship. Some great effects & death scenes make the movie fun. Also, keep an eye out for the Camp scenes towards the end...these are hilarious.",Jason X
209,TheyKilledTheGiggler,Loved It!!,10,23 July 2002,"I left the theaters back in April in complete amazement in how good Jason X was. I know I know Jason X is not an oscar worthy film nor is it part of the top 250 but it was still entertaining as hell. Being a big fan of the ""Friday"" franchise I found Jason X to be a great entry into the long running series. The film is not really scary at all but it is action packed and very entertaining. I can't wait until it comes out on DVD!!! OVERALL: 8/10",Jason X
210,Hellraiser-1,the series that never ends,4,30 January 2002,"I was expecting this project for a long time since I find a curious idea to set the story in the future and also for the fact that I heard it was going to have a theatrical release and it has been like that here in Spain, but not in the USA(How strange. I read in IMDB that it is going to be released in April but I can´t understand it, I saw it in November here, precisely the same week that Jeepers Creepers arrived, and while I was a bit dissapointed with that second one for some strange reason, I wasn´t with this. I saw exactly what I was expecting for and although it was a weak movie, I didn´t get surprised. Jason appears now in space and a lot of years later but the formula hasn´t changed, this is like an Alien movie but changing the monster for Jason and of course it is totally a B movie.The best of it was no doubt, the homage it pays to the first movies of the series in the first eighties, I laughed a lot at this part but for the rest I think it´s time to close the series in a definitive way,the same for Halloween because I am at the top of the tether about useless Halloween sequels and I have read that they have made another one, very original, they say but I would be a fool if i believed it. Well, I don´t know if Jason x will be finally released there but the only good thing would be that it encouraged that old project of Freddy VS Jason, if they got to write a good script sure it would be funny but I suppose it will be finally removed.",Jason X

212,klesker,URGH!!!,2,19 January 2004,"Ive always wondered if a Thesaurus could give me enough variations of the word ""awful"". Enough to describe what a shambles and travesty this movie actually is but alas i found it was not possible.This movie takes place 400 years after the last Friday the 13th movie and has Jason hacking and slashing his way through the student crew of a space station. As desperate and ridiculous as this premise sounds, i was always waiting for this franchise to take an interesting turn (the others all sucked) and with this i was hoping that my rants and raves would be answered.And in a way they were. This is very different from the rest if you look at it in a scewed point of view. The fact that it is set in space is a blatant IN-YOUR-FACE way of saying ""hey look, we've done something new. Please give this franchise the respect we've been dying for"" but i dont buy it. Just because it is set at such a ridiculus time in the future it still doesn't detract from the fact that it is still just your generic horror yarn.The horny kids get maimed, none of the other characters believe the heroine as to how much danger their in, people run upstairs when the front door is right next to them...other than its setting this film offers very little to an already over played and tried and tested method that makes the Friday The 13th films such a labour to watch.As with every horror movie there is always a hint of humour to stop the film from becoming too serious but this one makes you laugh non stop. Just like Pearl Harbour this film is unintentionally funny and this is mainly due to the performances. The acting in this film is shocking to say the least. The ""actors"" (if that's what you want to call them) plod their way through the film as if they couldn't care less. These guys look as thought they've just graduated from their community acting group.I can say that my opinion of this film is slightly bias in a way as i have never liked any of the Friday The 13th films but i was hoping for something new. i guess i was mistaken and foolish for not walking out of this movie. I was sitting there hoping for it to get good but when the end credits came i was appologising to myself for sitting through such unadulterated garbage.Whenever i review a movie i try and find a critical way to let a bad film down but all i can say about this one is this: it sucks. Jason X is Shit! The only thing it has going for it is that it is not John Carpenter's Ghosts Of Mars. I'd much rather go and watch Freddy Vs Jason again. At least that movie was fun.1/5",Jason X
213,mrphantasm,Yeah I loved this movie!,10,15 May 2005,"I'm writing this review in first person because I'm fully aware that is impossible to convince people to view a movie of the Friday the 13th franchise when they already have a negative point of view of Jason and his world. I saw this movie at least twice and what can I say? I loved it, I really enjoyed every second of it. Mr. Kane Hodder is the Ultimate Jason, and Jason X, has it portraying two versions of Jason. JX is the classic FT13 tale with the futuristic twist that introduces a lot of sci-fi extravaganza. Jason Voorhees is one of the most interesting monster of cinema, due to his origin, his killings are somehow justified (not like M. Myers or Freddy) because he died as a child when some horny teens didn't take care of him when he was in Crystal Lake Camp. Throughout the years he has become a modern myth. Some of the movies of Ft13th were great others not so great, but I think Jason X is among the best. JX shows how much cinematic language changed in this years, has an agile modern montage, the actors are well... unknown actors but they do it great, and the script has some clever and ironic lines, and finally the cinematography is stunning, JX doesn't appears to be a $20 million dollar flick it looks like a more expensive movie. If that is not enough, two celebrities of Horror met in the first scene.",Jason X
214,horrordude_666,Great!!!,9,17 July 2003,"I thought this would be crap. But it was great. Jason had great kills and a better story. When he becomes super powered was really cool but it still couldn't compare to the original. Jason is a really cool character but I think they should stop know. Let him die already. 15 thousand sequels is enough. Just stop trying.
When I got this movie as a present I thought the person wasted 6 bucks but it was a really good after seeing the other sequels (not including the third one that was good) but it was fine. The best futuristic horror (if it's not the first).",Jason X

216,davidhutch007,No X factor with this film,4,13 June 2006,"I picked this up for a cheap price, it looked an interesting way to spend an hour or so i mean a killer such as Jason in space could it possibly work? The plain and simple answer is NO. The idea was of great interest to me of could you possibly after ten films still make a great Friday the 13th film. This entry is weak and makes some of the others in a worse condition than this look like they should win an Oscar.Jason is cryogenically frozen along with a young woman who is trying to make sure he never kills again. Jason makes it so they both freeze for four hundred years. Along come a team of students and stumble upon the pair frozen and decide to take them to their ship in space and thaw the woman out and keep Jason as a piece of history, but Jason has other plans. He awakens and all havoc and body parts break loose.The film is poor in the fact that it feels more like a sci-fi film than a horror sci-fi film. There is no horror what so ever no jump out of your seat moments at all and for a film in this franchise that wasn't what i was expecting.The acting is appalling and the one liners are totally stupid. For example this tough navy seal kick ass type gets impaled through a door by Jason to which he says ""It's gonna take more than a poke in the ribs to put down this old dog"" Jason sends a blade through him and he says ""Yeah, that oughta do it"" i mean that just isn't horror thats comedic.The writing is full of that stuff and the story is totally stupid and a totally uncalled for sequel really.The action was great but over within a few minutes of actually getting started. Jason is as menacing as ever and makes some good kills but again its nothing we haven't seen before but it will be enjoyable to the gore fest fan.The direction has to be called upon too because this guy really has no sense of what a horror film is because he has put none of it in this picture and to be honest i'd be ashamed to call this a Friday the 13th film.Overall the film is just a dumb piece of horror that shouldn't even be called that. If your after craptacular special effects, stupid screaming from stupid girls and some kick ass gore then this is the film for you otherwise avoid unless desperate for something to do!! ***** out of **********",Jason X

This non-gory, PG-13ish ""horror"" film has nothing to do with the other entries and I must say this is easily the worst of the series. I detest any slasher series that acts as if the other films never happened like H20, (what a stupid title) Hellraiser:Inferno, and the last two Texas Chainsaw Massacre films. At least they could have piled on the nudity or gore but no, we have to settle for off screen kills and computer generated blood. What's the point? Oh but they sure did pile on the comic relief. Yeah I love horror/comedies that make me feel safe. WRONG! I hate this film. HATE!",Jason X

Even so, the movie had some great effects, the Jason player (Kane Hodder) was so excellent. The actors were, well, good enough. David Cronenberg, (Scanners, Existenz and Nightbreed) makes a cameo as a Scientist. I expected the usual machete slashing, but got random killings and decapitiations. Out of 10, 6 or 7.",Jason X
219,carolinephillips-47427,Jason Goes To Space,6,18 September 2019,"There's a saying when it comes to horror franchises that, when you've finally jumped the shark and you've run out of ideas, you send the villain to space. I guess after he went to Hell and took Manhattan, there was nowhere else for Jason to go.In the distant future, a bunch of students discover the frozen bodies of two people and one of them happens to be notorious serial killer Jason Voorhees. They decide to take them both onto their ship and thaw them out which, of course, leads to Jason hacking his way through most of the passengers.A lot of the CGI is spotty, the script is a mess, and most of the acting feels porn-level at best, but Jason X doesn't want to do anything but entertain and it does that well. I don't think it's possible not to enjoy a film where someone's head is frozen and then smashed onto a table into a million pieces. It's creative where it needs to be - the kill scenes.Jason X has to be about as dumb as slasher movies get (and some slasher movies can get really dumb), but damnit if it didn't win me over by the end. This is a movie that knows it's dumb and it's not trying to be high art. I can appreciate that.I was also amused by the David Cronenberg cameo. Didn't expect to see him here.",Jason X

Flashforward 8 years later, me hearing JASON in space sorta bothered me a lot. I mean where's FREDDY V.S. JASON. I soon found out that this takes place after the battle, which explains the scratches on the mask. But what writer Todd Farmer and director Jim Isaac gave what I think is the best in the series and JASON entrainment.In 2010, JASON(Kane Hodder) has been captured and studied on for a while by now, only planing the perfect escape. When so everybody dies except for Rowan(Lexa Doig), who freezes herself and JASON for the last 445 years. Now 2455, a school on a field trip from space has found both bodies and unthawed them. On there way to Earth 2, JASON awakes to weak havoc upon the ship, only to be rebuild to the ultimate killing machine...literary!This movie is not meant to take itself serious as the last one, but to have fun with what they got. It's death scene are among the best I've seen in a long time. My favorites are the freezing head and screw, although the gore is tone down since the last one. The relationship between the robot K-M(Lisa Ryder) and her creator Tsunaron(Chuck Campbell) is cute and funny, something missing since PART VI:JASON LIVES. Full of fun surprises and a kick a$$ costume JASON has when he becomes UBER JASON. You will also say this is the best one in the series.

I remember the graphic nature of the violence.Where did that go?  That's what the movies were all about.  SEEING a person get his head cut off with a bone saw.  SEEING a person's eye pop-out of the screen into your face.  Etc.Half of the gore in this movie wasn't even there.  You just saw the other characters' reactions as something bad happened to one of the others.  And, Jason hardly uses any unique methods of murder.  Just a knife or a machete. One after the other.  Blah, blah, blah.Also, there's no nudity.  What's up with that?!?  Oh, I guess there's that two second shot towards the end that was probably thrown in as an after thought because they realized there was no nudity in the film up to that point.  But, everything's blocked up to that point.Jason's got no personality or character in this film either.  You'd have to have watched the previous nine movies yourself to get anything like that. Jason started-out as a person out for revenge who could not be killed.  Now, he's just this killing machine.Boring.  The movie's an insult to ""fans"" of the series.",Jason X
223,Chainsaw Slasher,Great Movie,10,20 January 2002,"This is definitely one of the best Friday Movies. It's the least New Line Cinema could do after releasing the bad Jason Goes to Hell. This is nothing like Leprechaun 4 or Hellraiser:Bloodlines. This is just basically your standard Jason slasher, only difference is, is that it takes place on a spaceship and he gets an upgrade.

If Ed Wood were alive today and had a lot of money to spend on special effects, then he would be making films like Jason X. The dialog is bad. The acting is hilarious. Looks like they couldn't possibly have done more than 2 takes on average for every scene of the film.A quick rundown of the story. It seems Jason Vorhees is held in custody on some ship somewhere in space and when some real geniuses release him he goes on a short killing spree that is prematurely ended when he gets cryogenically frozen. Some 400 or so years later, he is thawed out and goes on another killing spree on the ship. It seems some people can never leave well enough alone. What ensues is easily the worst film of the new century and has no real redeeming qualities except for 2 nearly nude girls expressing their love for premarital sex. In other words, avoid this one.

What bugs me is when I read reviews by people that think that this movie somehow ruins the quality of the Friday the 13th franchise and that this movie is too ""hokey"" and unrealistic. Are you serious? This from the franchise where in the very first movie we are supposed to believe that a middle aged, average sized woman can overpower numerous men and athletic teenage boys? And where Jason has been drowned, mutilated, burned, exploded, and buried, and yet still is alive in the next film? Has this series ever been known for its realism? The point is that from the very first ""Friday the 13th"", there are numerous aspects that force the viewer to check his or her sense of the realistic at the door. This is a decent ""Jason"" movie and is well worth a viewing. I actually liked the fun jabs at itself and the franchise this movie has, and overall is pretty decent. 6 machetes out of 10......",Jason X

However, I had the opportunity to view a pre-release copy of ""Jason X"", and I must say that I was quite impressed.  I was somewhat expecting to see the same low-budget sets, amateurish acting, and spotty directing which plagued the previous installments, but I was pleasantly surprised.  As alien as it may seem, taking into account the other movies' mostly woodsy surroundings, the futuristic setting of ""Jason X"" was quite refreshing.  The movie had action, horror, and humor in a good mix, and I thought it quite entertaining. Obviously, if you were never a fan of the Jason movies, you will likely hate this one as well, but I think that ""Jason X"" will not disappoint fans of the series in any respect.

A team of government scientists working at the Crystal Lake Research Facility have finally captured the notorious and seemingly indestructible killer Jason Voorhees. In order to at least contain Jason, the plan is to freeze him in cryogenic suspension; but, as usual, things go horribly wrong and he breaks free to resume his murderous ways. The sole survivor of this latest rampage, Rowan, manages to lure Jason into the cryogenic chamber, but before she can complete the process and escape, she is mortally wounded and frozen in time along with Jason.Flash forward over four hundred years to 2455.The place is Old Earth, now a contaminated planet abandoned for centuries, a world of violent storms, toxic land masses and poisoned seas. Yet humans have returned to the deadly place they once fled; not to live, but to research the artifacts of the lost civilizations that caused this enormous environmental disaster. Little does the most recent landing party of interplanetary explorers realize the fate that awaits them when they stumble upon an unusual find from a primitive technological age.The student explorers, led by Archaeology Professor Lowe and their tech-droid KAY-EM 14, enter the ancient underground remains of the Crystal Lake Research Facility. There, they make a major archaeological discovery: two frozen ancestors; a beautiful young woman and a large man wearing a strange mask. There's only one problem: the auto-regeneration procedure has somehow been triggered. The frozen cry-jell is melting like a block of ice and soon the two bodies will thaw and deteriorate! With time running out, the young explorers return to their starship and blast-off for Earth II, where they are surprisingly able to revive Rowan, the young woman. But very soon, these students will come face-to-face with a shocking, totally new form of evil as Jason comes back to life as well and begins to silently stalk them through the corridors of the spacecraft.Forget what has gone before.

Like I've said in other reviews...this hasn't got a great story but what you do get is a known horror character doing what he does best, kill, kill kill!Jason racks up an enormous body count in this film and makes it look cool (don't go killing people though). Nice death scenes and some funny one-liners make this film quite enjoyable. Some of the characters were annoying but maybe that was intentional so we could cheer Jason on to kill them.I think this movie would make an excellent video game. You could be Jason trying to kill everyone or you could be a human character trying to stop Jason by setting traps and stuff. I wish they would make a game of it.I loved this movie.
P.S. People who tell the plot of a film in their reviews must be pretty stupid because the plot can be found at the top of the screen. Which means whoever does it is just wasting their time in typing it out. You really should be telling how you felt about the movie.",Jason X

Yes- it's stupid it's stupid as hell and cheesy... Did you watch any of the other movies?
Yes - it could've taken it self more seriously and has a few potholes.
Yes - it has the coolest death of any of the other movies (liquid nitrogen)
Yes - it's not scary... This one wasn't intended to be scary it was intended to be fun, it's pretty obvious ( corkscrew and sleeping bag)
Yes - people who love 'fun' horror movies but didn't like this one are idiots.
8/10- for the fun... and Kane Hodder was the best Jason.",Jason X
231,Dave-330,"""This sucks on so many levels...""",2,17 October 2002,"The line from the movie that I used as the summary, pretty much sums up this film.  Jason X has a couple of cool looking kills (the ice face and the Supergirl with a shotgun) and has Kristi Angus who is amazingly hot, but other than those few positives, the rest of this movie was bad.  It was a bad movie when compared to other ""non-slasher"" movies and even by handicapping this film against it's predecessors, it still is not well made. The cheesy effects that pepper the screen throughout, which are suppose to make the film futuristic, just come across corny and cheap.  I will give the filmmakers a break on the make-up, because I realize that the film had to be cut for US release but splashes of blood instead of full-blown gore is not an adequate substitute.  Why could Part 9 be released un-cut on video, yet the DVD of X is cut?I liked the first ten minutes of the film, the reemergence of Jason while being examined, Ms. Angus and the kills outlined above.  I hated the CGI, bad make-up, stupid plot, bad acting, poor direction, ""uber-Jason"", and the ending.Note to New Line Cinema: veto any ideas for Jason going to Disneyland, Mars, Japan, Atlantis, or anywhere else besides Crystal Lake.  In my opinion if this was the best idea that came out of the Cunningham braintrust, it may be time to pull the plug and have Freddy kill Jason and have Freddy continue onwards and upwards.I think that this movie is better than Parts 5 and 8 and I think that Parts 7, 6, 9, and 4 are the best of the bunch because they bettered the ideas introduced by the first three.  They are action-packed and half-way smart, while 10, 5, and 8 are far worse than the original three and nearly unwatchable.This movie deserves 2 out of 10.  SPOILER: The best part of the DVD is that you can choose a death to jump to, so you should watch the first ten minutes (stop when they are frozen) and jump to the deaths of Andrienne and Jason 1 and then consider yourself lucky that I just saved you over an hour of bore.  END SPOILER.",Jason X
232,mattboy61992,"Fun slasher flick, if nothing else",6,11 October 2009,"I enjoyed Jason X a little more than other people did because it was fun and it was a cool idea to put Jason in outer space, because the victims can't get off the ship.A bunch of critics hated it, and I have one question for them: ""What can you expect from a slasher flick?"" It's not gonna be Oscar-worthy, you're not gonna find any Shakespearean acting, and the plot is similar to other slasher flicks. Just take it for what it is.There is no need to really explain the plot, because its just like the other Friday the 13th movies, the acting is a little one-dimensional, and the movie is formulaic and predictable at times, but it's not the ""classic of the century"", it's a fun slasher flick, nothing more, nothing less, and it serves its purpose.Overall, if you're a hardcore slasher flick fan, you will love the gore, and if you are craving a movie with a story and incredible acting, then you're not gonna find it in this movie. Rating: 6.5/10",Jason X
233,ZMBKLR,Garbage as usual!,2,7 May 2002,"A basically harmless and lame film that tries to ressurect the (hopefully) dead Friday the 13th franchise. In the aftermath of recent real world events, does anyone really think Jason is scary anymore? I miss the older films that were real gorefests. Lame, poorly acted, but still gorefests. That's the only reason I used to see them. So what's with this movie? Jason and his keeper end up frozen where a greedy scientist unleashes the horror of Jason on the 25th century.  The writing is imbecilic at best, but some of the deaths are pretty inventive. I keep wondering why the military didn't just expend a nuke on Camp Crystal Lake, but that's just me.  The acting is the 'best' of any of the Friday's for the most part. Lexa Doig (Andromeda from the TV show of the same name)is the star, the scientist frozen with old Jase. Kane Hodder, who really doesn't act, is back. He's played Jason more than any other stunt man.  So over all, the film is partially entertaining, partially dumb and basically, hopefully, the end of the series. I'm actually surprised that having sat around for over two years, it didn't end DTV!",Jason X

Some of his other outings have involved, Gut ripping, Heart eating, People ripped in half by a machete and the list goes on.Although quite tame compared to his previous works, Jason, Now in the future has the chance to leave his mark on a peaceful civilization. Not as much blood and guts in this one yet, I believe this is one of the best i have ever seen.Finally the Jason series gets a good story with a reasonable budget and some reasonably good acting. I really like this one, It's very different from the other Friday the 13th series and it has a lot more fun factor as opposed to just gratuitous violence and sex!I would rate this movie as 8/10 and i think any open minded Friday fan would enjoy it too.",Jason X
236,PickUrFeetInPoughkeepsie,"Entertaining, if nothing else",6,23 March 2004,"Jason X is an entertaining blend of horror, sci-fi and comedy, though the film doesn't go very far in any of the three categories alone.  The best way to view this film is to simply not expect it to deliver anything and just sit back and enjoy it for what it is: a slasher flick!  And for being that, it is quite amusing.  The comedy in the film does succeed considerably more than other slasher flicks which try to incorporate comedy into the mix.  At least I thought so.  Really, I just enjoyed this film cuz I had nothing better to do when I watched it and was in the mood for something... well, stupid.  That's what it is, and for being stupid, it's fun.  Sometimes it's fun to be dumb. 6/10",Jason X
237,NeverAgain85,Not the Worst Movie - Pretty Good,5,29 December 2006,"Okay Okay, so its not the best movie either, but its a good idea to add to the Friday The 13th Series. Jason is cryogenic-ally frozen from 2010 - 2455. And is eventually found and taken on board a spaceship along with a Female Research Assistant who was accidentally frozen with him. He wakes up and starts going on a killing spree. The movie does have some weak spots along with some horrible clichéd sentences,and not the best acting,the characters are seriously stupid and goofy-like who think that the best time to crack a joke is when they're dying. But i did like the idea of Jason becoming half Metal- man towards the end, But the writers could have made that more special by putting a bit more effort into the acting if they cared at all about Jason. The movie has lots of blood and gore and Jason hacking up lots of people, So isn't that what everyone wants?However the Movie could have been made a lot better..",Jason X

But I've heard that Jason X is pretty ridiculous, so there we go :PSo it's pointless to be mad at poor characters development, crap story and all that good stuff. Because it's the movie about an immortal psychopath killing people. Using a machete. Wearing hockey mask. In a spaceship.It's cheesy, cringeworthy, poorly written mess, but it doesn't matter, because... strangely enough it's fun to watch. It's that kind of mindless fun, but hey!There are even 2 unforgettable scenes in this crap! 1) crazy fight between Jason and cyborg lady - Jason loses an arm, a leg, half of his torso and the head :P 2) possibly the best death scene in the cinema history - Jason smashing frozen head of the future science lady against the table.All in all, I can't give it more than 5/10 though, because it's still C class cinema :P",Jason X

Anyway Friday the 13th is to good for the Oscars, everyone knows only crap is nominated. Well take my advise just sit back have fun, this movie is great, you'll laugh, you'll jump, you'll have fun.

This movie was excellent when you really think about it. This time they got it right, all we really want to see is Jason take out as many people as he can in 90 minutes. Friday the 13th whether you like it or not is a part of American cinema history, just like Star Wars and James Bond. I really think what makes people mad is the fact the Jason X proved that special effects are not hard to come by these days, I mean get real if Jason X with a 14 million dollar budget had the effects it had then why the hell does Stars Wars need 100 million. Can't wait for Jason VS Freddy next year maybe then this franchise will get the recognition that it SO deserves.

I have been a huge fan of this series, I've been watching them since I was 8 years old and I've seen them come and go from theaters, seen critics dismiss them, and have had to defend them from people that just don't get it. You just can't take them seriously, just have fun with them.
Jason X was actually the best of the series, Jason jumped right in there and one by one by one took over the ship. People also keep trying to reject the special effects in this movie, which is crazy, they were awesome, I think what bothers people is that some movies like Lord Of The Rings, and Star wars use these unbelievable budgets for special effects, then Jason X comes along and with a mere 14 mil creates awesome effects.

Also, the scene with the skanky campers was quite funny for something I think they meant to be comedic.Anyways, Jason X was bad. VERY bad. At least Freddy vs. Jason was tolerable.

253,Magnus-83,"A bit of a sell-out, but nice anyway.",5,16 June 2005,"Watching ""Jason X"" gave me the feeling that it was the most expensive Friday the 13th-production ever. It sure was the most glossy, at least.Plot, short: In the beginning of the 21st century, the authorities decides to do away with Jason for good. As many have tried to kill Jason permanently in any way that are possible (as well as a few that aren't) without success, he's now to be contained instead of killed. A young woman manages to freeze Jason in a cryo-chamber. In the process, she also manages to freeze herself as well. A few centuries later, Jason and the young woman is discovered and picked up by a spaceship, and she is revived by the medical staff onboard. Jason, of course, awakens again, and goes for another killing spree.My opinion is that ""Jason X"" is well worth watching, at least if you're a Jason junkie, like yours truly. It has all the necessary stuff for a true Friday the 13th-flick, like hot young chicks, big guy with a hockey mask and a bad attitude, and lots of blood and gore. But I also miss the camp-setting, the dark woods, the cabins, and all that you'll get in the older movies in the series. I really loathe any attempt to scientifically explain what Jason is and why he never stays dead - It shouldn't be explained. Jason's a blood-thirsty freak in a hockey mask, who mysteriously comes back to life every now and then. Period. And I don't like the attempts of portraying him as even slightly human - Blood-thirsty freaks in hockey masks aren't supposed to be human or even likable (in preferred order), just scary. But anyway, the sci-fi-setting was quite nice and different, and I suppose that true low-budget-horror-art like this can stand a few experiments with the setting. But anyway, the way I like it, a good Jason-flick should be about a psycho wearing a hockey mask and killing youngsters in the most gruesome and gory ways imaginable, and ""Jason X"" is. But it doesn't need any expensive CGI or SFX. Ketchup, melee-weapons and gardening tools are more than enough, I'd say.Bottom line: Watchable, but not nearly revolting enough for my taste, and I give it 5 blood-smeared buzz-saws out of 10. Could be worse, could be better.",Jason X
254,einTeufel,A Fun Ride,7,5 February 2003,"Jason X was fun. It wasn't film making at its finest, but the thing is, it wasn't trying to be! It was just trying to be a throwback slasher movie, and in that, it succeeded greatly. The film is self aware of its camp value (remember the 'Holodeck' of Camp Crystal Lake? Come on! That was great fun! ""We love premarital sex""). Thats why it was entertaining! Everyone knows what they are in for when they go to see this type of movie (the teens having sex... they get it. The girl dressed like a tramp... she gets it), and it delivers without taking itself seriously.",Jason X
255,haxleyandrew,Jason X Is Not even Entertaining,1,6 February 2012,"Again another good film ruined by James Isaac who took this from the original Friday The 13th franchise and ruined this for everybody.Since it came out, It was horrible. The film itself was not that great and also was not even scary at all.Evil Gets An Upgrade In the future a group of scientists decide to find Camp Crystal Lake hoping to study it closely. Upon knowing it they find Jason Voorhees and try to take him back to do some research about him and why he cannot be stopped. And because the Earth is contaminated and is inihatible. They take him aboard a spaceship to study him. Meanwhile a young scientist named Rowan decides to study Jason Voorhees and see if he's alive in one of the pods. But turns out that he awakes and gets out of the pod using his machete. But then both get frozen in the process.Now in the year 2455 Earth has become polluted to support life and humanity has moved to a new planet which is closest to all the other solar systems. Meanwhile a group of students find both Rowan and Jason frozen at the Camp Crystal Facility and try to get both frozen bodies onto their spaceship and after having moved to Earth 2. The students examine both bodies and put them in pods after finding out what happened. Later they examine and start unfreezing Rowan and tell her about what has happened to her. But then Jason is ressuracted and starts killing everybody on board of the ship while going on his killing spree.Now the first thing i would have to say is why would this take place in outer space. Because that's what the producers wanted it to take place there or maybe even take place on board the spaceship. Either way it's weird. Also why does Jason get an upgrade in this film, He is like normal in the Friday The 13th franchise. But in this movie he looks like a cyborg and a robot, And also his machete looks newer and better then his old one for some reason. I mean why was his machete upgraded and what happened. I don't get this either and for some reason what's with the mask. It just changes in every Friday The 13th film and that's it but for some reason this mask is new. Better, And is a lot more metal looking then his previous hockey mask. Could they have even managed to bring back the hockey mask from the previous films and put it on him. Wow talk about how bad the mask is, Also this movie does have a good amount of graphic killings like where Jason keeps killing and stabbing everybody on board with his machete while unleashing terror on Rowan and of course her friends. But also let's not forget how he kills also other people by also snapping their backs and of course stabbing them in the stomach which is just awful. It's not even scary and how pathetic can it really get when he just kills without warning and his victims make jokes. That is really not what it's about and besides the crew members on the ship never make any jokes when they are killed and the scares as you could say are just horrible because they don't scare their audience.The special effects in this film are just plain boring. From all the outer space scenes, It seems that the camera always manages to focus from one thing to another and it just keeps doing the same thing just to make everybody mad. And besides it's really cheesy because that's what they do that makes it awful.Also Kane Hodder was amazing as Jason Voorhees and he deserves the most credit. But in this film he does kill and yes of course that's what he does. And honestly he deserves the most respect because he was a great actor in this film and his talent and performance were spectacular here as well.But also the cast was just plain horrible. They never acted very well and certainly never did good too. Like the android who tries to kill Jason by shooting at him which never works out too well and she gets killed later on and the crew members don't react all too well in these situations. They just always play childish games and always make horrible jokes just to make you bored. Plus those jokes are cheesy and are not too funny at all as they just don't make them sound funny. Rowan on the other hand tries to stop Jason but he tries to kill her and also the other crew members get their backs broken. And their stomachs are stabbed by Jason's machete which kills them. They never react to well to situations and are the worst at acting and their performance as you could say is just plain horrible.Also the script looks as if was done by some the studio on purpose. It is just horrible to read and also is really horrible in my opinion. This film's script is very awful to read and in my case just plain ordinary. Also the script sounds if it was just horribly made and not the best way to read or even try to make it. They could have made the script a lot better then being garbage.This film is just plain junk, It's not scary, It's not creepy or disturbing, But it is very bloody and violent. And although Kane Hodder was amazing in this film. The film itself is just plain horrible and is ruined by yet James Isaac. So i advise you to please not watch this in the theaters and please don't spend your money to see this garbage. Trust me save your time and money but don't go out to see a horrible film that you will not enjoy.",Jason X

This movie is about Jason on the rampage in space which might sound like the bosses at New Line Cinema are running out of ideas but this is a great film. Because this is set in the future, technology has become more advanced making for some creative and gruesome death scenes which is more than satisfying. There is also a lot of (intentional) humour here with the characters saying the most idiotic things, for example the characters are in a room with Jason outside Rowan: ""i think he's still out there!""

259,Porkchop_Express,An enjoyable entry to the series,9,28 May 2002,"Well it took 9 years for a new 'Friday the 13th' movie, & I was weary when I heard that the movie was going to take place in space...but I'm sure glad I was wrong! Unlike other movie franchises that tried to make the jump into space, the F-13 series really didn't change much; which is a good thing. Many people were glad that Jason eventually left the woods, but like part 8 showed, that wasn't such a good thing. The movie starts off in present time where Jason is going to be frozen, since he cannot be killed. But an accident freezes both Jason & a scientist at the Camp Crystal Lake Research Facility. The movie cuts to the year 2455 next. A scientist & his students are visiting Earth for a scientific expedition (Earth has become a wasteland planet). They stumble onto the facility, & bring back Jason & the scientist's bodies back to their ship. When the scientist is brought back to life, she warns them about Jason, but it is too late. He wakes up & starts on his killing rampage...again. Like in so many movies, Jason is yet 'killed' again, but due to the ship's medical lab, he is 'upgraded' & becomes stronger than ever. Even though the movie takes place in space, it is still a F-13 film at heart. The space environment doesn't change that. The movie is fresh, with some great death scenes & nice one-liners. And the ending leads up to a new sequel. Since this movie has been getting some decent reviews & has made some money, hopefully we will get a new F-13 film or the long delayed 'Freddy Vs. Jason' film very soon. This movie is a lot of fun...go check it out!",Jason X

261,ScottyJBD,The worst Jason movie yet,7,27 April 2002,"Contains Spoilers Im a big Jason fan, so when i first heard about this movie about 2 years ago, i got really excited. When i first heard about the 500 years in the future part I became disappointed and figured it wouldnt live up to the others, mostly because of the atmosphere change that Manhattan couldnt live up to. So time goes by and finally the movie is released, the opening scene made me laugh, not because it was bad, just because ""thats jason for ya,"" but it made me curious as to why the hell there was a research facility right on crystal lake, and how the hell did they manage to put jason in chains *SPOILER* i still wonder how the hell he got out of the chains *END SPOILER* It seemed the good ol government became interested in why Jason wont die, how hes able to regenerate body tissue, anf of course, jason breaks free only to be frozen moments later.At the point i decided that this movie sucked was when most of the deaths werent shown, about 30 people dies and only 10 of them were actually shown, and some were quite gruesome! the first death was the best, too bad the chick was so hot! I dont think ive ever seen a movie with character development as bad as this, even the main character, Rowan, you dont give a s*** about, as much as i wanted her to live i really couldve cared less, the only characters i felt for were Kay-Em and Brodski, Kay Em was hilarious and Brodski was such a tough guy.Just as the movie is nearing its end the funniest scene ive seen in a Jason movie yet comes up, with 2 topless chicks of course but i wont spoil anything else. Id say this scene saved the movie for any liking i gave it.One of the big reasons i didnt like this was because it was non stop killing, the movie never paused for any real dialouge, or any plot development for that matter.The atmosphere was another big problem, how can you do a Jason movie without a forest? I mean, even #8 pulled it off, but this movie lacked 'scariness', at no point was i ever scared or even intense about some chick about to lose her head. No suspense whatsoever, Jason didnt even toy with any of his victims.Also the death scenes were really crappy, there were only 4 or 5 that actually had any creativity, while every other jason movies death scenes are all quite creative, or most of them at least.As soon as Jason was upgraded it was really downhill from there, too bad the movie ended 15 minutes later. *SPOILER* he didnt even kill anyone! wtf *END SPOILER*Another weakness of the movie was the way Jason was killed, i can see why they did it, but i just hope it leads to a sequel.On a scale of 1-10, i give it a 6, because its a little better than it is stupid, i wouldve given it a 3 if it wasnt for that final scene of comic relief.All in all, this remains the worst Jason movie ive seen so far, but at least it was good for a few laughs.",Jason X
262,arric,Got to love this stuff.,8,27 April 2002,"I gave this bad boy and 8 but I am quite biased.  I freaking love these movies.  But I am not so biased that I gave it a ten.  Just like the way that Jason Goes to Hell did not deal with the ending of Jason Takes Manhattan, this movie did not deal with Jason Goes to Hell.  Call these movies stupid but at least for the most part they have a continuity.  And when people say ""Jason is always coming back form the dead""  I have to say that that did not happen until the 6th installment people!But I digress.  I enjoyed this movie.  It wasn't scary (heck they haven't been scary since I was 12).  But it was enjoyable.  And the way the movie pokes fun at the whole series near the end (in the hyper-reality room) is very nice.  Quite humorous and shows that the makers had a good time.
Perhaps my want for another installment has blinded me to good quality but I was first in line to see this movie when it came out.  So when are they going to explain Jason 8 and deal with the finale seconds of Jason 9?  That I want to know.",Jason X

264,MikeyMo_nl,"One of the best Jason's, if not the best",7,30 May 2002,"The 9th sequel of the Friday the 13th series is a long awaited one. SPOILERS Apart from Jason goes to hell all other fridays were produced in the 80's and it shows. 8 Episodes of Friday the 13th delivered a lot of script recycling and brought us one of the most memorable icons in horror of all time: Jason Voorhees. 2 of the previous 9 movies tried to be different (5 & 9) and they both failed at that, so the production team was warned before changing anything radical to the standard Jasonmovie storyline which is: Jason resurrects, wreaks havoc on nearby camping teenagers who have sex and do drugs and gets killed by one or two teenagers who still have there virginity. However, in this post-Scream-era the productionteam got a multimillion dollar budget and changed, despite of being warned, a lot to the concept. Does it work this time: Yes! Jason isn't resurrected this time, he's captured and awaiting to be cryogenically frozen (the previous sequels pointed out that he just simply can' be killed). Something goes wrong and he escapes, temporarily 'cause after a few kills he gets trapped in the Freezer with the lead heroine and they both become frozen. Time flies by as we go 400 years into the future and Jason and the heroine are defrosted on a spaceship with teenagers(!) and a dozen marines. From that point it's just another Friday the 13th but this time in space and with CGI-special effects. Teenagers who have sex get killed, all the marines get killed, people who try to make money of Jason get killed, so far no surpise. The only surprise we get is UberJason; half robot, half organic. This is a nice addition (must admit I didn't think it was cool on the moviestills, but in action he remains Jason, only with a new look) Now, the lack of suprises don't really matter cause you get what you expect. The formula works perfectly in space and seeing Jason take on an entire team of marines is something else than just defendless teens. However this movie excells in the same way part 6 excelled: humour. Jason's kills are laughable (he's screwed) and the remarks the crew make are hilarious (I don't think he's out there. Well, why don't you stick your head out and peak then). The retroscene is also brilliant and hilarious, and is one of the many proofs that we all know that this is the 10th installment in a slasher movieseries. I really liked this Jason movie and it is one of the best out of the series, if not the best. My Personal faves in the Friday installment: pt. 6 and Jason XNote: it might be useful for people who are new to Jason to rent a couple of the old movies, so they can catch all the selfspoofjokes (especially the retroscene). But beware if you do: all the old movies are pre-cgi and big budget moviemaking.",Jason X

Serious, all the Friday 13th saga is trash gratuitous violence with no motivation at all. Jason just shows his hate against humanity, or whatever. A faithful Jason movie has GOT to be trash. So, the movie ends, and some people just leave the movie theater revolted with the crapiness of the script. I left the theater satisfied: I expected to watch a trash movie, and I did watch a trash movie, and I laughed hard at the trashness of this flick.

Jason is somehow revived, kills dumbass campers at crystal lake, Jason's ""killed"", new cheap looking movie arrives a couple of years later.Jason X had something different from most of the others: 1.)It didn't look cheap like most of the others. This was a low budget film and it looked pretty good. 2.)Jason didn't look like a jackass. He actually looked cool in this one. The guy has been plagued by bad make-up for years. No huge-ass tumors growing out of his head complete with tiny hockey mask and strings of long hair in this one. 3.)People that actually knew what they were doing and fought back. I guess some people wanted more bumbling jackass teens running through the woods, but i've had enough of that years ago. 4.)The new costume was pretty cool.As for the complaints, i don't understand the backlash. God forbid they try to do something different. You've always 8 basically identical movies you can still watch. .....and why wasn't it scary? Jason ceased to be scary after the second movie IMO.

268,Lucianivision,The film Jason X should've gone FULL Comic Book,6,21 March 2015,"Spoilers abound:When Neil Armstrong said his famous quote ""That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind"", I'm 99.99% sure he wasn't referring to Jason Voorhees, slasher extraordinaire. Hell, when Jason first started slaughtering horny teens at Camp Crystal Lake, no one could have predicted that years later he would be off into space (or even Manhattan for that matter).Enter Jason X (no relation to Malcolm) the tenth film in the Friday the 13th series (with the ""X"" doing double duty here as not only the 10, but also the unknown, or more accurately Uber Jason who shows up for the last reel).Kane Hodder returns for his forth (and to date, last) time portraying the hockey masked killer. Once again, he embraces the role and gives Jason a little personality under the mask and makeup.Although this movie was shot on film, it was one of the first features to be totally transferred to HD video. This allowed for a quick turnaround for the numerous digital effects (most which look horribly dated) and also for some cool colour timings that give the picture a brighter comic book look. Of course, as with every Jason movie, there are a couple of memorable kills - the stand out in this one being the head freeze/table slam, which I simply call ""smash-face"".Unfortunately, the film's pacing is horrible. It starts well, introduces our main batch o' characters, but then abandons them to focus on a bunch of unnecessary grunts, who suffer mundane deaths. This drags the film down completely - not to mention the whole thing reeks of a bad Aliens ripoff. Fortunately, the film eventually gets back to the original crop of victims, I mean characters, and has a few cool tricks up his sleeve. As for the music, Harry Manfredini's opening credit theme is great, however, the rest of his score is uninspired, and doesn't even seem to match the action on screen.But what about this so called SUPER JASON? Well, Uber Jason is cool, but I believe his new look would probably wear out its welcome after another film or so, as the iconic (read: Old School) Jason would be missed.Fans are seemingly split on this instalment (lets face it, fans are split on every entry in this franchise, which is what makes it so darn fun to talk about). However, I believe that this one stands above parts 7, 8 and 9. Yes It's stupid, but its somewhat fun nevertheless. Admittedly, the filmmakers should've gone ""full comic book"" given the premise, and that (mixed with the bad score) is what keeps this one from being one of the best.For a more in-depth dissection of this film, check out our Friday the 13th (Jason X) podcast here: http://tgif13.podbean.com/e/jasonx/",Jason X
269,Bailiff,Uber-Jason Smash!,6,19 November 2003,"The Friday the 13th series goes the way of Critters 4 and Leprechaun in Space, but this is much more fun than those two (or maybe it's just because I'm a Jason fan).  There are some pretty creative kills in this one, but a lot of strangely uninspired ones too.  With the obvious exception of Robert ""Fred Krueger"" Englund, Kane Hodder is the king of all slasher actors (actually he's the only man to portray the silent stalker for more than one sequel, and he's still damn good).  The film was shot in Canada, so David Cronenberg drops in for a cameo.  There's a funny scene at the end...I won't spoil it, although someone else probably already has on this site.  The new Jason is pretty cool, but we don't need a Jason X2 (and not just because it sounds like a Mega Man game).  If New Line feels inspired to eke out another Friday after Freddy vs. Jason, then it'd be best if they return the series to its roots.  Still, Jason X is a pretty good time-waster for fans of this eternal franchise.",Jason X

By the time this movie was released twenty years ago, it had also been twenty years since the original with Betsey Palmer was released back in 1980. Time flies.Anyway, I thought this movie was okay for what it is. By now, especially after Jason Goes to Hell, the shark had been jumped by a mile. So why not go to outer space and kill people in the future? Why not freeze Jason Voorhees and resurrect him hundreds of years later? Because at this point, do you really care?That said, the kills are actually quite well planned out and creative. The nudity is there. The characters are as silly as the previous camp counselors.

274,frog663,Delivers the Goods,9,26 January 2004,"I have come to the conclusion that a good portion of the people who submit reviews for films like Jason X do so simply for the ""thrill"" of seeing their names or e-mail addresses on screen.  Seems a lot of you would be better off attending an autopsy in your area than watching a movie that is supposed to simply be entertaining.  Given that the previous Friday films had run out of steam, it made all the sense in the world to try to steer the franchise in a whole new direction.  Where the original Fridays were nothing more than T&A/slashfests, it is a formula that loses it's appeal after so many sequels.  If Jason X accomplishes anything here, it is injecting some life into an otherwise stagnating series.We know Jason cannot die...he has proven that, time and again.  Thus, we no longer watch to see if he will finally be killed.  Instead, we wait for him to die, just to see how he'll manage to come back anyway!  The method of this in Jason X is obvious from early on, but it still works.  The ""new and improved"" Jason is worth the wait for, even though he is not on screen all that long.As has been the staple of all the previous installments, the characters in Jason X were, for the most part, just killings waiting to happen.  I think it's a safe bet that, if there is a Jason XI, it won't involve anyone from MENSA!  Face it, the characters in any Jason film are there for the sole purpose of running, screaming and dying.  Any personality or acting ability that shines through, above and beyond those three things, is always a plus. In this case, I found most of the acting very credible, considering the circumstances.  I was especially taken by Melyssa Ade (Janessa) who, in my humble opinion, stood out in every scene she was in.  All I can say, to those of you who are reading these reviews before renting Jason X, is to go ahead and rent it, and watch it with an open mind.  If you're looking to be entertained, it does deliver the goods.  If you're looking for a 90 minute bloodbath, maybe Faces of Death would be a better selection for you....",Jason X
275,friskysman,Horrible,1,18 November 2003,"This is, undoubtedly, the worst movie I have ever seen. Period. I've seen a lot of movies, a lot of bad movies, but this one is at the top of the list and nothing else is even close. Oh, of course there are movies that are much worse-made in all aspects, but when you consider the 'Friday the 13th' franchise being utilized and the results obtained, nothing compares.There is not one single redeeming quality in this movie. Not only am I surprised this did not go straight to video, it should never have even been given that honor. 'Jason X' reeks of bad-TV-movie from beginning to end. I don't even know that I would go so far as to say TV-movie. It reminds me something that would be categorized as the worst episode of the worst sci-fi series ever. From the terrible camera work, to the horrible special effects, to the embarrassing over-acting, to the ridiculously cheesy soundtrack, to the childish script, this movie has 'amateur' written all over it.When it goes for laughs, it fails miserably. The only laughing you will do during this movie will be unintentional on the part of the director, I guarantee that. On the other hand, there are absolutely no worthy scares. Of quite possibly the cheapest way to get scares - jump scenes - I counted one. And as I said, they are cheap. As for gore, there is nothing here that is worth anybody's time. I would guess that on half the kills, the camera cuts away just before the money shot. This is the business of a PG-rated movie, not an R-rated Jason film. Inexcusable. What gore they do show is laughable at best.In horror movies, you are supposed to like the characters and be rooting for them to survive. When characters then do die, it is that much harder to watch. In 'Jason X', you are rooting for everyone to die as painful a death as possible.and you don't even get that satisfaction.And on top of everything is the complete implausibility of the whole situation. But I won't even bother. By now, you will either take my advice and stay as far away from this movie as possible, or you are a glutton for pain.'Jason X' zero stars",Jason X

278,hireswell,Some Thoughts I had After Seeing Jason X,4,28 April 2002,"* I'm sure that the resurgence of the dead-teenager/mad-slasher genre in the 90's (most notably attributed to ""Scream"") motivated New Line to bring back Jason for another film, but the executives should have realized that ""Scream"" was making fun of movies like this.* It's never a good sign when the best actor in the movie is the guy who has his face covered by a hockey mask. * By my count Jason kills 30 people in this movie; that works out to about 1 kill every 3 minutes. The Truth.com better not find out about this statistic, it could put them out of business. * Fans of the series will appreciate some of the formula elements that you expect from a ""Friday"" picture:      - The Forwarning: Rowan, the woman who was frozen along with    Jason, tells of the numerous ways in which they tried to kill Jason and yet when Jason is on the lose she is assured by the ships optimistic professor that there is nothing to worry about. - Inventive slaughters: Jason dunks a girls head into   nitroglycerin, then smashes it into several pieces against a wall.                                                                     - Horny Teenagers: Since when are science students this hot,   dressed in clothes that would make Madonna blush and excused from lab in order to fornicate.                                           - False Death of Jason: I've seen Jason come back from being hung,   axed and macheted to the head, electricuted, drowned, drenched with toxic waste and sent to hell, but I never I thought I would        see him get up after he had his head blown off in this one.* Yes, this movie sets up for a sequel, but when are we going to see Freddy vs. Jason?* With regards to the special effects: They Suck!. Now that everybody is using computer graphics, it's time to limit there use just for the films that can afford to use them well. The space scenes in this movie are on par with the worst of the original Star Trek series. This gives more evidence that what Tom Savini was able to do back in the original ""Friday"" was a real breakthrough and it is too bad that this film is connected to that film.",Jason X

280,Htom_Sirveaux,Leave your brain on the doorstep and enjoy.,5,3 January 2012,"""Jason X"" is silly, campy, ludicrous... and loads of fun. I think the problem here with most negative reviews is that they're taking it too damn seriously. Do yourself a favor and take it with a grain of salt; that's obviously what the filmmakers did. It's a slasher film set in space; what did you expect, ""Citizen Kane""? Granted, the whole slasher-in-space thing has been done before with ""Hellraiser: Bloodlines"" and ""Leprechaun 4: In Space,"" but neither of them were this much fun.First off, we're shown Jason (Kane Hodder) inside a government research lab, never explaining how he escaped from Hell after the ninth film. This is actually explained in ""Freddy vs. Jason,"" which was still stuck in development hell at the time, but if you need any explanation, here's one as good as any other: yes, Jason was pulled into Hell, but they were afraid he'd take over, so they threw him back.Anyway, in an attempt to move the world's most infamous undead mass murderer to another facility, oops... he escapes, killing David Cronenberg and about seven other people in the process. Project head Rowan (Lexa Doig from TV's ""Andromeda"") manages to freeze him cryogenically, but at the cost of her own non-cryogenic status as well. Fast-forward about four hundred years, and the Earth has become uninhabitable. Human colonists from another planet light-years away descend upon the ruined Earth on a ""field trip,"" and guess who they find? Though Rowan is fortunate enough to finally be resuscitated by them, unfortunately, so is Jason, and he goes back to doing what he does best on board the ship after awakening to the sound of - you guessed it - horny young people doing the dirty. Their only hope is Rowan, android Kay-Em 14 (Lisa Ryder, also of ""Andromeda""), and a very bad-ass Sergeant Brodski (Peter Mensah of ""Avatar,"" ""300,"" and ""Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles"").Is ""Jason X"" a great movie? Of course not. But that doesn't mean that it's never entertaining. Horror film fans don't go to movies like this to see Oscar-winning performances; they go to see a huge masked guy with a machete who knows how to wield it. Furthermore, in spite of the movie's flaws (of which there are admittedly many), at least this entry in the ""Friday the 13th"" series takes us out of the whole Camp Crystal Lake setting for once.

282,FreedomWatchTower,The X is Killing the Fun,2,20 November 2017,"(I am Reviewing this Film in the Context of the Series and as mildly as possible as an actual Film on its own)To quote a line from the Film itself which perfectly describes the Whole experience ""This sucks on so many levels!"". If one would want to describe the Whole Film in as sparse words as possible it could simply be described as ""Jason in Space"" or ""Imagine Alien without the Alien but with Jason instead and much cheaper looking"".First a bit about the Background of this Flick, it had the Biggest Budget of the main series (1-10) and it was meant as an re-igniter for the franchise, for the reason of ""Jason goes to Hell"" being the introduction for the long planned ""Freddy vs Jason"" (which finally came to fruition in 2003), one of the writers had the idea of Sending him to Space so the series could get a fresh entry.The problems of this sequel are to many to count, from unnecessary transition scenes that break the mood to a horrible and cheap sounding Film Score, Bad lighting, and and and. The Worst problem of this Sequel is that you can see and feel that the Sets got made cheap and fast and the CGI was worse than on most TV Shows that where made in the 90s and the Dialogues where laughable Bad (even for a Friday the 13th Film). There are so many scenes where you force yourself trough and think how in the F#@*ing Hell did this get green-lit. Some examples: One of the Characters gets grabbed trough a Wall by his throat and Jason Pushes his Machete through the Wall and his back, the character says something like ""aah oh god, how could you think you can kill me like this"" and Jason Punches another Sharp object through and the Character says ""ah that's it two is better than one"" and he faints. Or a scene near the End Where a protagonist gets sucked trough a whole and right before she falls trough she says ""this sucks on so many levels"". This Film made me angry as i was plowing through the Whole Series, which grew to my Heart even if most of them where Trash they at least where a Big Bumper Bag of Fun, this one is not. One highlight of this Flick was a Scene where trough VR technology Jason gets transported to the 80s Crystal Lake and kills two Chicks in old Classic fashion, and as a wink to one of his predecessors, he hammers a girl in a sleeping bag against a tree.This Film was an affront to everything that was Fun to the Series, the other Films where made way cheaper but managed to look way more expensive. The Director didn't seem to have enough of Fantasy and Vision, as laughable as the Idea may be imagine a more talented Director at the Helm.

There is no excuse for something this dumb when millions of dollars are being spent.  With this movie's budget, New Line could have probably made a decent, and original, sci-fi movie.  But NO!  Some exec was like ""We can just make another Jason movie and market the hell out of it and make it look cool!  The teeny boppers will love it!""There are so many things about this movie that don't make sense.  Fist of all, in the beginning, Jason is somehow captured.  This must have been a pretty difficult task, seeing as he's the deadliest killer the world has ever known.  So you think they'd have about a hundred guards watching him right?  No! Of course not!  That would make sense.  Instead, they have ONE guy watching him.  So of course Jason escapes and mayhem ensues. Etc, etc. Fast forward to four hundred and fifty years in the future (!) to a highly advanced society that doesn't know what a hockey mask is, but they still know what DVDs are, and everything goes downhill from there.Look, I don't expect every movie to be a magnificent work of art.

Jason is in some weird lab and gets loose somehow (yeah, like in Jason Goes to Hell, I guess we must forget parts 1-9) killing people in a non gory fashion (how late 90's) and gets frozen. Now it's 455 years later and a group of students on a space ship find Jason who they unfreeze like a bunch of schmucks and now he's loose, killing them all.There is NO gore at all, less than any of previous films and hardly any nudity that us men love to see in our Friday the 13th films. There is non stop comedic one-liners that must be put in all modern horror films, thus re-enforcing the fact that the horror genre is dead (thanks to Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer). Is the audience now that stupid that they must need comedic scenes after all scary scenes? I actually think that moviegoers are getting more moronic as time goes by.I am glad the film makers spat in the faces of all 80's Friday the 13th films and it's fans. Watching this bootleg version with all the ""gore"" intact (what a joke, go see an action film now if you want gore) made me realize that because of all the hip young actors making stupid jokes and not showing their privates, this film will gross a ton of money. Too bad, this just makes me want to go back and look at all the Paramount 80's Friday the 13th films. All of a sudden, Jason Takes Manhattan is a masterpiece",Jason X
287,user-11512,"this movie achieved what its 80s contemporaries did, pure Friday the 13th murderous fun and a lil suspense",7,24 October 2006,"Being the 10th film in the franchise (Friday the 13th Part X), this film followed the exact same formula of its prior films. The difference was the change of scenery, last scene in Crystal lake (Part IX), before touring Manhattan for a Part VIII haha you'll definitely have to tune in for my review on that...i don't even want to call it a movie but i don't know what else to call it haha...Anyways Jason X mixes in a little history of Jason just to refresh everyone's memory of how brutally ruthless and maniacal this demon deformed man is. Another welcomed technique in this installment is how it remedies and takes pokes at the stupidity and simplicity of the 80s genre itself. I found this film very entertaining and although its not overwhelmingly scary by any means, it delivers and exciting and fun-filled horror film starring one of the stable mass killers of the 80s. If you enjoyed this, then you can catch more of Jason as he battles Freddy in Freddy V.s. Jason, in which its story plays out in similar style to Jason X rather than Freddy's most recent Film New Nightmare (1994). See this movie you'll appreciate it for what it was meant to be, a reminder that we haven't forgotten about Jason Voorhees and the minions of sex, drugs, and rock n roll teens hes decimated.",Jason X
288,dingo865,"Vile, Repetitive, and BORING",3,10 April 2008,"Vile, repetitive, self-serving, stupid, and worst of all: BORING.This series has never survived on the strength of its story lines or character development, but on one or more of the elements most people expect from a slasher flick: an interesting antagonist who could be killed but doesn't, characters you are afraid to lose but do anyway, and gore that is both spectacular and original in its presentation.This garbage gets rid of all the above. Once you realize that Jason survives absolutely ANY and ALL forms of destruction imaginable, it simply becomes an endless cycle of the same 5-minute segment of killed/revived, killed/revived, killed/revived... ad nauseum infinitum. Once you realize that all the characters could be reanimated at any moment (though, most stupidly of all, the protagonists introduce this tech in the beginning, and then promptly forget about it for most of the remaining ninety-something minutes) you stop caring about whether they get killed or not. Finally, the vast majority of the gore scenes come from the seen-that-many-times-before collection, so even originality is out through the window - or airlock, in this case.The saddest part is that the special F/X are generally very good (i.e. ranging from TV-level-serviceable to feature-film-quality - hence my rating of 3 stars), and the cast (composed mostly from the crew of the TV series 'Andromeda') features several talented - or at least visually appeasing - actors and actresses. By the time the end credits roll, you feel like you have just been violated in the nether regions of your body, but so badly that you fell asleep in the middle of it.",Jason X
289,led_zeppelin_zoso,"oh i'm going to stick my Head in a dark hallway where Jason is, duh",4,28 February 2005,"this film was horrible, the characters are so stupid it made me laugh along with my friends. and one question, why did they decide to start of in a space station, one more question, why would these people be so stupid to stick there heads into a dark hallway that is dark and has a serial killer wondering the hallway with a weapon that could, you know, chop your head off. i wouldn't say this is the worst of the Jason series because in the other ones the one thing that bugged me was that when the victims are running through the forest while Jason is carrying a spear and walking so slow you and then the victim falls and somehow Jason appears right behind them with an ax which i have no idea how he got. do not see this movie.",Jason X
290,upthetoshy,"Crystal lake might be a distant memory, but never you mind--Jason X brings the CAMP to outer space",6,22 July 2018,"Jason X, the 10th installment of the Friday the 13th series, leaves the serene and eerie woodland backdrop behind and seeks out a new frontier... You guessed it: Space! (the final frontier). While at times you might not be able to shake the feeling that you are watching an even worse rip-off of 'Hellraiser: Bloodline"", don't let that deter you from watching this little gem of a film. If you love gore and campy humor, Jason X delivers in spades. In fact, and perhaps not surprisingly (if you've seen the cover art and/or read the synopsis), this is quite possibly the silliest, campiest, most ridiculously implausible Friday the 13th in the series--and that's what makes it so great! Think 'Friday the 13th part IV' meets 'Lost in Space' meets the gag reel from 'Alien: Resurrection'--What could possibly go wrong?!Here are some highlights (mild spoiler alert): Jason is captured and brought to a crystal lake research facility where, thwarted in their many attempts to kill him, the scientists resolve to study his regenerative properties for the good of mankind (and some fat $$$, presumably). Following a struggle at the lab leading to a rupture in a cryogenic pod, Jason and a scientist both wind up frozen, and despite his otherwise steel imperviousness, Jason is somehow rendered inert. Fast forward 445 years and (all while the bogey man was sawing logs, mind you) humans have polluted the earth to the point of complete uninhabitability and have moved to a new planet: Earth 2. Ah hahahaha--ahem--excuse me... Some students on a trip to earth (and yes, crystal lake is a hot spot for post apocalypse Earth 1 vacationers) find the frozen bodies and bring them back to their spaceship where calamity (and hilarity) ensues. You might think that by the 10th Friday the 13th film they would be running out of inventive ways to kill people, but in this you would be mistaken (thanks, especially, to the new 'outer space' setting). As expected, Jason comes out of his 445 year nap swinging, slamming VR space campers against a tree while they're zipped up in a sleeping bag, and shattering another young lady's face against a table after shoving it into liquid nitrogen, just to mention a couple. All in all, it's a fast-paced, raucous good time, and the twists and turns are innumerable, as Jason is presumed dead no less than 3 times throughout the film, eventually falling victim to an explosion only to be resurrected as 'UBER-JASON'... Delightfully ridiculous!... Such a 'film' obviously deserves better than a 4.4. I'll give it a solid 5.5",Jason X
291,Davros42,"Not the best, but better than the last few.",8,4 February 2002,"I was excited/skeptical when I heard that a new Jason was going to be released.  I was excited because I'm a huge fan of Friday the 13th. Skeptical because the last few had been bad, especially Jason Goes to Hell. However, I was not too disappointed.  The music was good for the most part, but at times it made the movie cheesy rather than horrifying.  It sometimes sounded like B-grade film music.  The film overall did have a dark feel, returning to the style of the first four.  There was one or two moments that were very funny (esp the scene with the simulated camp counselors) and surprisingly it worked!! The special effects were decent and a lot and time and effort was put into making the deaths look real.  Overall I was impressed and pleased to see another horror legend revived.  Now lets just get him and Freddy teamed up...",Jason X
292,stealth_rock,different and hilarious,10,2 May 2007,"I enjoyed Jason X very much and I rate in one of the best in the series. You ask why, there is one simple answer: its different!!!! Jason is absolutely menacing, and to travel to 2455 or whatever ridiculous year it was, and destination: ""earth 2"" it was very well thought out and a heck of a lot different to all the others in the series. I found a lot of scenes hilarious as well, not going into great detail but the ""unkillable"" lines at the start were hilarious. And also the ""upgraded"" cracked me up as well.Jason at his best in this one people. don't miss it 10 blood-soaked knives",Jason X
293,the cranky quibbler,"Please, God, no more...",1,28 May 2002,"I've always felt a very deep sympathy for Kane Hodder. Kane Hodder, if you didn't know, has played Jason Vorhees in every Friday the 13th movie since Friday the 13th Part VII. I mean, this guy's whole career consists of stalking people with a giant machete and hacking them to bits. And after watching Jason X, I felt an even deeper sympathy for him.Jason X begins in 2010. The government has Jason Vorhees imprisoned and are keeping him alive to study. They figure that anyone who stays alive, despite being killed several times, is worth studying. Rowan (Lexa Doig) feels otherwise. She thinks that he should be put away where no one can find him. Something goes awry and Jason is loose. He disposes of everyone, with just Rowan left. She attacks him and throws him into a Cryogenic unit where he begins to freeze. But, before he freezes completely he stabs his way through the door, and Rowan gets frozen as well. It's now the year 2455. Earth is no longer inhabitable. Professor Lowe (Jonathon Potts) leads a group of students to the remains of Camp Crystal Lake. They find the two frozen bodies and are able to bring Rowan back to life. They assume that Jason is dead and send him to be examined. While being examined, he suddenly wakes up and goes on a wild rampage once again.	 The whole story feels like a bad episode of Andromeda. Nothing really ever makes sense and random things occur that have no relevance to anything. In the first few Friday the 13th movies, Jason actually had a motive, albeit a bad motive, but at least he had one. In Jason X he just knocks people off one by one for no apparent reason. He doesn't know these people, and they aren't remotely related to anything that happened at Camp Crystal Lake, so why murder them?The script, by Todd Farmer, is full of ridiculous dialogue, thickheaded characters, and absurd situations. You'd think by the year 2455 that these people would have seen enough horror movies to know not to split up when there's a maniacal killer on the loose. And they should definitely not assume that the killer is dead when, in fact, he never is. The characters speak the most blasphemous dialogue. These characters seem to think it's necessary to crack a joke right before they die, as if Jason might find the joke funny and spare them. All ten of the Friday the 13th movies all pretty much stick with the same story and setting. Why they needed to upgrade Jason and set it in a spaceship, I don't know. Jason X couldn't stray father from the original even if it tried. The only thing that this and the nine other movies have in common is Jason. Even Jason is starting to look a little worn out. And then just when you thought that the movie couldn't get any more pathetic, Jason gets an upgrade. Jason falls into an upgrade machine that makes him bigger, faster, and meaner. He even gets a new mask!When a movie has a body count higher than the number of people that are going to see it, it's not a good sign.---------0/10",Jason X
294,theinvisiblemonkey,What could be better?,10,27 October 2002,"All Jason movies are fun to go watch with friends and have a good time. Anybody who walks into this film or any Jason (or Freddy or Michael movie) and starts to criticize it may just want to choose NOT to even bother with any of these types of fun movies that are not supposed to be taken seriously.  I think that JASON X was pretty much the same as all the other Jason films... Horny immoral teenagers get punished by a guy that was neglected when he was a child.  His neglection has feuld his rage towards the camp (teeny bopper) counselors SO MUCH, that it has kept him alive to punish all teeny boppers more concerned with their hormones than the safety of kids (notice that he took sympathy on the kids in Jason 6).  Except in Jason X, he just got an awesome look at the end.  And anybody who just can't stand these movies, would really like the end part of this movie, because the producers/director also make fun of their own movie in a way that critics may find amusing.  If they stop at Jason X, it's been an entertaining ride, and if they continue to make these movies, I'll continue paying for popcorn at these shows. Let me to go off on a tangent... think of this .. a movie that parents WILL NOT take their kids to, or would not see themselves.. ONLY gets the numbers of the people who would see the movie or are allowed to see the movie.... BUT.. movies that parents WOULD NOT want to see (like some kids movie or Disney flick) are going to get the numbers of the kids tickets (which are many) plus the parents or the Adults who have to buy a ticket also who normally wouldn't buy a ticket.  Think of that next time box office numbers fly up on certain movies.Adam Campetti",Jason X

So can someone please explain to me WHY and HOW New Line Cinema allowed to make SUCH A BAD Jason film that will surely KILL THE FRANCHISE forever out of theaters?!!

296,HerrSupahz,Terrible... hot garbage,2,7 March 2021,"I am a long-time horror fan. I love slasher flicks, especially the original Halloween and the Michael Myers character. The first few Friday the 13th movies were classics. As I was looking for something to watch on Netflix, and this showed up. I hadn't seen this in forever. Since that previous viewing, I've seen many, many horror films... and many, many of them were terrible. ""Jason X"" stands alongside some of the worst I've seen. Not even 7 minutes in and I wondered why I was watching this again.Briefly... does this movie think it's being funny with the premise? Because it's not. The plot is nonsense, with many plot and logic holes. Outer space... okaaaaaaaay. The acting is weak. This ""super Jason"" is ridiculous.You'll see a lot of 7/10 and 8/10 reviews for this movie. Horror fans are an interesting lot. Why have to make do with more garbage films than probably any other genre. And we're more forgiving for franchises we enjoyed in the past. This explains some of the reviews... I'm guilty of enjoy crap films too. But this is beyond that for me.Long gone is the sense of fear and terror that you might have felt when Jason was stalking teenagers in the woods at Camp Crystal Lake. This is a parody, essentially, and it's bad at that, too. What you have here is a lame attempt at maintaining a pulse in this long-time franchise on life support... it would have been better for everyone if they had pulled the plug on this movie before they started.",Jason X

But Jason X just goes too far in what we fans can really tolerate. The premise is new to the Friday the 13th series, unfortunately the ENTIRE story hinges on the premise of the movie ALIEN. Basically greedy government officials want to keep the ultimate weapon alive at the cost of anyone in a hundred mile radius. Of course Jason breaks loose and begins to kill and cut his way around the spaceship which is all fine and dandy... and then BAM, three consecutive nude scenes *yay* so far, it's basically the Friday the 13th Formula, despite the entire teacher sex scene (Which I will not even MENTION.) So finally they know Jason is around and BAM we hit the same formula again (i.e. Nerdy dude is electrocuted, stupid bimbo kills herself by accident.) And I must at this time comment that the chicks are even stupider in this edition (Who shoots Jason and then leaves him ON A TABLE BUILT FOR FIXING PEOPLE?) OK so then they fly around, blah blah, Jason then kills an entire crack squad of marines (Another ALIEN REFERENCE?) The teens panic and run around like chickens with their heads chopped off. Then Jason regenerates into something that will shame fans for many a year, he transforms into Uber-Jason. Luckily for us, he usually is only seen in walking sequences, that, and the occasional bang against a tree. The kids end up blowing up their entire Home space station (Is it made of glass? You'd think a space station would at least have a shield.) Then it comes down to the five, Tough black guy who sacrifices himself... (again) Cyborg and her (ugh) Human boyfriend... Slut who sleeps with the now deceased teacher. and the main chick. To make a long story short, The slut ends up having one of the stupidest deaths in the movie, that death could have been so amazing yet they are content to put some slices of bologna on the railing and BAM! A death scene. I won't ruin the very end for you, sufficient to say it also is reminiscent of ALIEN. The entire movie feels like it's being fed down you're throat, it has awful one-liners (32% :o), Terrible deaths that just reek of the other movies, and stupid teenagers AS USUAL. Yep, this sure was a great movie... The only time I would ever recommend this movie, is if a mad scientist gave you the choice of watching it, or eating Rusty nails, and even then, it's a close race.",Jason X

The special effects are okay and the unknown cast do a good job. I couldn't help but notice David Cronenberg in the credit list, is this the David Cronenberg who brought us ""The Fly""?On the whole this movie isn't bad, try not to think about the fact that this is 80's serial killer Jason Vorhees in space though.

It seems that the seriese has become so stretched that they are in dire need to start stealing ideas from more successful childrens programming.  Trans Metal Jason, please. Acting is sererely underpar...too...say...the closing credits. Special effects are simply and lame.  The most pleasing were the tiresome explosions. Camera work was frightful.  Frightfully uninspired that is.  Nothing but simple angles, and 1 or 2 classic Hollywood 80's slasher horror enemy-behind-the-helpless-females angles. Plot...there was one??  It takes place in the future on a ship that whos population seems to exist for just one purpose.  To be killed.  What other conclusion cold one draw as 50% of the people are killed all within 10 minutes. You might be asking where DID it make up that one point??  Well, I'll tell you.

When I first saw the opening credits I already knew that this film would be a disaster. The score was terrible by Harry Manfredini, and I know that he could do better.  The music from the original Friday The 13th's were great, creepy, and scary.  It sounds better when he uses real orchestrations instead of cheap synthesized music, like on ""Jason Goes To Hell.""  The whole plot of this film was rediculous, and I thought it was a bad cast.  The acting wasn't too great either, and this film wasn't hardly scary or suspenseful. It was like a joke, and made the Jason series look bad, in my opinion.  The special effects weren't at all believeable.  Overall, this film was very disappointing and I can't stop thinking of all the bad things found in this film.  I think the filmmmakers should have been more serious in making this film, and not be so comedic, because that ruins it all.  Jason fans wanted to see something new and exciting, but this sure wasn't, I was very disappointed and if I knew the film would have been that bad, I wouldn't have even wasted my time going to the theatres...I give this film a D+, and on a scale from 1 to 10, a 3.",Jason X

It's been a long time since I saw Jason on the big screen and I welcomed his return. The body count was high in the film (in the teens), which was very important to me, although I still cannot understand the sex scenes.

It's a Friday the 13th film staring Jason Voorhees. If you have the nerve to call yourself a film aficionado, why are you watching a slasher film series that began in the 1970s? And yes, I was there at the beginning. These films are made for entertainment and to make money. It's called show business for a reason. Frankly, I think this is the best film of the series since the first one, which broke new ground for horror at the time. This is a 90 minute B movie that's meant to be an entertaining story.

I didn't know how the flick was going to be (the whole space thing kind of scared me) but when i finally saw it I was truly impressed. The side chrecters of the films are well drwan out and are interesting unlike past friday flix and there is an end sequence in a virtual crystal lake that will make you burst out in laughter(the good kind). When this film comes out watch it! I'll be first in line with the popcorn!,Jason X
314,caged_insanity,I just ended up laughing at the deaths and screaming at how stupid it was.,4,23 August 2002,"Another pointless sequel to countless other ""Friday the 13th s"", this film offers little in the areas of suspense and terror. It's not going to have you jumping out of your seat or hiding behind a pillow, because it uses the age old method of scaring you with gore. nowadays, this just isn't enough to scare an audience of horror fans who have seen it all before. There are some original ideas, such as the first ""single"" death, which in my opinion, is the best in the entire series, but in the end you just get annoyed at how Jason is absolutely invincible. It is one of the better sequels, but in the end I just ended up laughing at the deaths and screaming at how stupid it was.",Jason X
315,Whatt,Best One Yet,10,1 October 2002,"What more can I say, this was a great Jason movie. He is the ultimate horror movie slasher. This is the best Jason incarnation since part 7 (New Blood). Kane Hodder is great what he does. I suggest if you are even a remote fan of the series to rent this one when it comes out. There are some interesting kills and a very good change with our main title killer.",Jason X
316,Brandonhanna,Wuz up J-Space!,10,5 November 2008,"What can I say, Friday the 13th just does whatever and the fans suck it up. Where most franchises die once the go to ""space"" Jason got an upload. I don't care who you are this movie is totally fun. Friday the 13th has never tried to be anything more than fun, something to show to your friends while partying. It always comes through with kills and...well kills, Jason is the master of that. Love the first 10 minutes, by that point you know Jason was back and time to sit back and watch the blood flow, the movie delivers. It delivers on the fact that Jason kills, that's what you pay for that's what you get. For all these negative comments, I would think by part 10 if you didn't like Jason please just don't watch.",Jason X
317,DanTheMan16,What did we do to deserve this?,1,17 November 2002,"The worst concept of movie-making in action: The head of a movie franchise says, ""Well, we have done everything possible with this killing psycho in the previous nine movies, so it is time to call it quits...""  Then, a voice from the back of the room quietly says, ""Lets send him to OUTER SPACE!!!""... and presto!! What we have is this sorry catagory of movies that includes ""Critters 4"" and is culminated in the awfulness that we call ""Jason X"".
The following sections of writing contains some SPOILERS! Yes, I said SPOILERS! So if you have yet to see this movie, and for some very sick reason you plan on watching the ""horror"", please stop reading here because there are SPOILERS ahead.To me, there were only three slightly entertaining parts to the entire movie: 1- the opening violence seen where he brakes loose and goes on the best all-round rampage of the whole move. 2- the part where he kills the doctor that was restoring him. When Jason put her head in the liquid nitrogen type substance and then preceeded to smash her frozen face on the table only to have it completely shatter, I thought that was the best use of gore in the film. 3- the sleeping bag scene. That was absolutely the funnist part of the movie, I fell over laughing. It was great, but it did not happen often enough to make ""Jason X"" worth seeing again because there were to many logical mistakes to not get upset with.Like:First of all, the whole ""field trip to Earth 1"" is as dumb an idea as anybody with 14 braincells could come up with. Then, what do you think the odds are that the ""field trip"" happened to discover, of all things possible, the cryogenically frozen remains of Jason. So what do you think they do? A - leave the frozen man alone. or B - take him aboard their spaceship. Guess what? They thought no harm in choice B. Once on the ship, they actually run a DNA test and discover they identity of the ice man as Jason... and they defrost and reanimate him ANYWAY!! How stupid could they be? What did they expect? It does not matter because those idiots died the aweful deaths they deserved. Then, why not end this terrible movie with such a ridiculous finale that it leaves normal people cursing at the director? Once half of the ship blows up and Jason is floating in space, with NO OXYGEN might I add, he is somehow making his way toward the remaining part of the ship with the survivors, when he is just about to come in contact with the ship, a soldier that Jason maimed comes floating from Jason's side, also WITHOUT OXYGEN, and tackles him into the atmosphere where everything burns up EXCEPT the Mask.To summerize, the 11 entertaining minutes of the movie are not even close to making up for the rest of this disasterous project. All things said and done, please, I beg of you, DO NOT SEE ""JASON X"" EVER!!!!!!",Jason X
318,ir0n_jaw,"Bad acting, bad effects, bad story= BAD FILM!",1,5 August 2003,"Now I'm sorry if I offend some of you Jason fans but this movie is possibly the worst film I have ever seen. The acting is absolutley awful... the cast is more irritating than entertaining. Whats more, the plot is nothing more than stupid. I rented this film for a laugh thinking it would be a semi-scary slash-fest, but no. The film has no atmosphere and would be more scary if it featured the rug-rats.Something this film seriously lacks (apart from a good cast and a good script), is atmosphere. Horror movie??? nah, its trying to be a comedy full of unfunny one liners and slapstick. Really you couldn't care less if someone died or not because of the bad acting!!Another stupid American horror franchise flick gone wrong... when will they learn?!0.5/10",Jason X
319,williamsij,Great for fans,7,8 September 2003,"If you don't like horror films and are not a fan of the ""Friday the 13th"" series then you were never going to enjoy this. If you are a fan of the series, however, then this is a great addition - the comedy elements really work and the special effects are great - adding extra impact to the shock-horror scenes. I watched this on DVD and the DTS soundtrack was fantastic... with the sirens going off around me and the rumble of the explosions I really appreciated the extra effort put into this film.
For those who took this film too seriously, have you ever heard the expression ""tongue in cheek""?",Jason X
320,TheBishop34,Always a bad sign when it goes to space,3,18 October 2013,"I happened to catch this last night, and it really is amazing how things are different as time passes. Now don't get me wrong this was not a very good film when I first watched it 12 years ago, but I didn't realize how bad until I was watching it with coworkers last night. Outside some of the kills and the few times it hits with humor the film is nearly the worst in the series.The best actor in this film is Kane Hodder, and that is not a good sign people as he is the silent hulking masked monster that says nothing. Outside of him everyone else here is pretty woeful, delivering some awful dialogue from an already stupid concept of putting Jason in space. The one thing you need from your lead female in this film is the ability to be the victim to at least sell the fear. Lexa Doig is an actress of limited range and this was clearly beyond her and the writing for her did not help.On top of that we are treated to some pretty awful effects work, the cgi elements are bad I have seen better effects work in Syfy originals.The final insult to fans of the series is Uber Jason, the Jason upgrade that appears towards the end of the film. He is simply ridiculous, a silver masked, reddish eyed cyborg.I understand this film is not trying to be a hardcore entry in the series but in the attempt to make it extra campy they soared passed that goal right into stupid and bad.",Jason X
321,DirtyTracksuitBillinEpisode32,"Not a good film, but I'll always love it",6,9 November 2020,"I gr w up with this film on DVD (as well as Freddy vs Jason), and it has not aged well. That's not to say that it was particularly good when it first released, because it wasn't, but it's not nearly as entertaining as it was nearly twentybyears ago. That being said, I've probably seen this Friday film more than any other in the series, and I still feel an attachment to it. The producers, writers, etc actually had the unmitigated gall to put Jason in space, and whilst it doesn't add to the terror that the series is known for, it does provide some interesting and entertaining scenarios. There are some brutal kills that take advantage of the futuristic scenario, and some interesting callbacks to Jason films of all. This film isn't fooling anyone. Nobody would walk away from it feeling that it is a ""classic"" or good, but as I've said already, it's very entertaining.",Jason X
322,kroko007,Bad to worst.,1,11 March 2006,"Yes this is the 10th movie of the Friday the 13th-series.The first Friday has good atmosphere.It is the best of the series and i found it really good. The second is not perfect but also not bad!Jason is very cool with that shape on his head. The third Friday is ""good"".It has a lot of enjoyable scenes and Jason has his hockey mask! The fourth Friday is bad!!I found it really bad and awful!! The fifth Friday is also a bad one,no Jason and that is very stupid of the director. The sixth Friday is better than part 4 and 5 and pretty good. The seventh is really good and better than part 3. The eight is not good but also not very bad.I found it a mediocre movie. The ninth is a super worst movie.No comments.But what about the tenth.Well it is horrible.I never seen such a stupid movie.Jason is gone and has change into another stupid mechanical droid!!Really bad and awful.",Jason X
323,kevin-89,"I loved it,but not quite the best",9,31 December 2002,"This flick is a combination of gothic horror and future space-travel flicks.It is kind of Star Trek meets Amityville Horror.I loved the various lines or allusions to both Horror and Sci-Fi/fantasy.   It starts out a facility for cryogenic research-where the latest solution for washing hands of Jason is the freeze him and let the future take advantage of him.A scientist is accentally frozen with him.So we get into the heart of the movie-I'll let the viewers discover that.
   In all:I would give it an 8 for horror,6 for comedy and 5 for sci-fi",Jason X
324,Platypus-8,Can't Say No,7,28 April 2002,"So help me God, I will support the Jason franchise to the day I die. No dearth of quality, no depth of incompetence will tear me from the first horror I ever came to love. That is why I bump Jason X from its rightful grade of 6 of 10 to a towering 10 of same. The killings were inventive, but there seemed to be too few. I say that some 15 or 16 are appropriate in the modern era, as established by Jason takes Manhattan, for example. I didn't like the jokey manner of things. I expect a more dark and grim theme. It often ruined things for the very victims of murder to make the quips about the way in which they were killed.The so-called UberJason was just too goofy. He seemed cool in publicity shots, but comes off like the villain from Power Rangers during the film. Kay Em, Rowan, and the sergeant were all cool. I could have done without the rest, but that's always the case. It's lucky that even three characters come out likable. Chronenberg was kind of cool too.The highest budgeted feature of the series to day showed where the money was spent, and it seemed like it was mostly scifi effects, and not the killings as I would have wished. Anyway, like I said, I can't say no to Jason, so for all faults it has, I accept Jason X with open arms.",Jason X
325,JeffreyDJ,Makes the worst mistake a horror film can make.,2,6 May 2002,"This movie fails on so many levels. For those interested in 'kills' -- the ones here are fairly bland and bloodless.  With the exception of one death early on in the movie, which was somewhat original, many aren't even seen on screen. The real mistake this movies makes as a horror film is that it is neither scary or funny. There is no tension and the jump moments are oddly missing. Rather it turns out bland, boring and lifeless, much like Jason himself. Perhaps his age is starting to show, because even as the new ""improved"" Jason he has the same old MO. There are a few interesting moments.  The female android was amusing at times, Lexa Doig is cute, and Jason in a VR 80's Camp Crystal Lake scene *is* rather funny.  But 8 minutes of film just don't make up for the lack of entertainment the other 70 minutes+ do not deliver. I was bored beyond belief for long stretches of this movie.",Jason X
326,buddy3_16,Good if you're a fan of the series!,7,4 May 2002,"Going into the theatre I knew that I was not about to view an Oscar caliber filmand that the way a Friday the 13th film should be!  Horror films are supposed to be somewhat cheesy, and not have overblown dramatic performances.  They are supposed to give a good enough performance that makes you care about them, but not so much that you are crushed when they get killed.  The only character that you are supposed to like that much are the ones that either survive, or get killed saving their friends and kill the bad guy.  Everything is not supposed to make sense.  How many times have you ever personally encountered a superhuman killing machine, like Jason Voorhees?  Not many, and if you did, you would have probably been killed. That being said, Jason X was a really good horror movie, and it stayed very true to the F13 series in many ways.  There was constant action, a little T&A, some classic F13 gore, and a whole lot of fun.  Oh yeah, there were also some really cool death sequences, and the filmmakers really did a good job taking advantage of the projected technological advances when plotting out some of the deaths.  The best part of the movie was the distraction that Kay-Em 14 sets for Jason in the hologram room.  Not only does it take Jason back to his roots, but it is very comical.  Oh yeah, and at the end there was a very cool sequence that makes me believe that there will be another sequel, but it will be in a Camp Crystal Lake type setting.  Let me just say that I loved this movie.  It is definitely not the worst movie in the F13 series (that honor would got to either 5 or 8.)  However, it is not the best movie in the series either, I don't think that I could make that distinction, because too many of them are really good.  It really was very true to the F13 series; only it took place in space.  There were only two things that I disliked about this film: 1) the sequence following Kay-Em 14's upgrade, and 2) the cheesy one-liners that plagued certain parts of the movie.  However, if you are a fan of the series, neither of those aspects will prevent you from enjoying the film!  Like I said, it was not an Oscar caliber film, but if you go in expecting that quality of film, then you are not familiar with the series!  I am a huge fan of the series, I own all 9 films, so my opinion is very biased.  Being a big fan of the series I give it an 8.5/10.  With one point getting knocked off for Kay-Em 14's upgrade, and half a point getting knocked off for the one-liners.",Jason X

Years after having gone to the movies to see Jason's dead the final friday (yeah right, how many times have they said his final film and it happening?) I walked out disappointed, I thought I was a sad end to something that should have ended long ago.......but then...hollywood made yet another Jason movie. Lets face it people, the more you purchase films like these, the more waste will be shelled out. This movie is insulting to anyone who followed the series, The plot was the same, teenagers, having sex getting brutally slaughtered, and of course you have the hero's and then there's jason.

Jason is deader than the deadest-dead guy wrapped in celophane on Christmas morning and you want a storyline befitting of a some literary idea of suspending your disbelief? You want some classic horror genre-writing? ANYTHING, and I mean ANYTHING, this film is going to base itself on is going to be a FARCE.  How could you expect anything more?  As the director said about the film, ""The Friday the 13th series is beyond criticism now."" Why? Because EVEN HE KNOWS the F13 series passed any semblance of reason and sensibility about 20 years.  This is not a film to make you wow at the writing, it is a fun, high-end campy slasher film with cool ways people die.  That's it. End of story.  The movie never attempted to be anything more than it is and means everything it does. Someone once defined ""quality"" as the creation of something that does exactly what you want it to do.  The thought realized clearly, per se.  In that sense, this is a quality film.  It sets out to be a fun slasher flick, and it is.  I can't tell you the last time a group of friends and I jumped out of our seats yelling, laughing, and clapping at a scene as when the ""frozen face"" scene occurs.  What else do you want?  Now, if you were fooled by the previews that might have misrepresented the intention of the movie, that's the studio's fault--and yours.  What were you expecting?  This was a fun, good movie.

335,vnordov,A Balls to the Wall Jason movie written for Jason fans,10,2 December 2003,"The Friday series has had a lot of ups and downs.  What started as a fairly suspenseful murder mystery with an Italian horror twist was quickly turned into a Halloween clone by its first sequel.  From then on, scaring was just a thin pretense for films that were only made to wow you with creative deaths.  After making a whole armload of these killfests of varying quality, how do you top it all?  By removing the pretense, revealing all your conventions and then doing a little dance in them.Jason X is a streamlined gore machine, designed to keep raising the bar by having the masked menace kill tougher targets in new ways.  The body count rises to a height you probably can't even imagine and the deaths will have you falling out of your seat.  The human characters aren't just fodder though, they have entertaining personalities and fun dialog which'll keep your interest even when jason isn't there to turn them into red smears.Jason X is particularly a movie for those at least marginally familiar with the Friday line.  If you've never seen a jason flick, you won't be able to appreciate the parody and self-reference that are the major source of Jason X's fun.  You don't need to know anything about the F13 universe or any trivia at all, just being aware of the formula is enough.  (I recommend friday part 4).

Though consistently the same, ""the Jason films"" have always been some-what satisfying, but this film is a disgrace to scary movies of all kinds. I've seen pornography with more satisfying acting, and story lines than Jason X. I honestly feel sorry for anyone who was even tempted to cover their eyes at one point in this film. I soon discovered what the ending was, but I'm not going to tell you because it was so embarrassing, I just can't go on with this review. Awful.",Jason X
338,jersey-3,One of the better ones of the 10 movies,7,27 April 2002,"First off, I've been a huge Friday the 13th fan for many many years.  And I was one of the few people in the theater who was old enough to remember all of them.  (I am 29 years old...a lot of 16 year olds who said they are excited to see Jason 'X'.  I didn't have the heart to tell them it is really Jason Ten and that the X is a Roman numeral for it being the 10th Friday the 13th movie.  Ah, the state of education these days...)Anyway, before I saw the movie, I didn't like the idea of going 450 years into the future for killing in space.  I am an old fashioned guy who likes Crystal Lake and the cabins.  But I was pleasantly surprised by the movie. There were some interesting killings, some good laughs, and some good nostalgia (mentioning earlier films to a degree.)However, I guess the Friday the 13th series is no longer a horror genre. This movie, I would not call a horror film...but a Sci-Fi slasher picture. There wasn't much scarry in the film.  Unlike the earlier films where there was ""suspense"" and even though I knew someone would die, I would jump from fear when Jason showed up.  There was none of that in Jason X.  And I think I discovered why...In earlier films, Part II, Part III, and Part IV (we don't include part I and part V since it wasn't Jason), Jason was ""killable"" and more of a ""man"". So Jason had to be sneaky, like a boogie man who lived in the shadows. People doubted if he really existed and was just a wives tale.  (Kinda like Mr. Snufalupagus (sp?) on Sesame Street...at least in the old days.  I haven't watched Sesame Street in a long time, but people tell me that everyone sees him now.)  This made him scarry.Nowadays, everyone sees him and knows he is ""unkillable"".  Hence, the horror suspense is not there.  He's just a constant machine who doesn't hide and doesn't seem human.  (The human characteristic was the best part in earlier movies.)Now, back to Jason X.  If this had been a pure sci-fi movie, without the slasher stuff, it would have made a great sci-fi movie.  I would've loved to investigate and discover what occured over the past 450 years of mankind. Being 450 years into the future bring up interesting technological inventions, and my personal opinion is that Jason X handled them somewhat realistically.  (Others may disagree.)  Unlike typical movies in the future where they have inventions like time travel, worm hole creation, etc.  This movie tried to be more realistic.  It would not surprise me that in 450 we have great virtual reality and the ability to re-generate body tissue or the ability to stop an cut quickly and reattach a limb at a later time.  I like the cryogenic side too.The beginning, with Jason chained up, and then switching places with the guard and killing everyone I thought was too predictable of an opening and started on a bad foot (luckily the predictable stuff ended there for a while.)  The only other badly predictable part was Jason coming back to life during the autopsy.  We saw this already at the beginning of Part IV and a somewhat similar thing in the beginning of Part VI and Part IX.  But I guess there was no other way to do it.  Except if Jason was left alone and he came back to life.  I would have loved to see a human side to Jason where he is confused by being in the future and not on earth.  But oh well.I thought the characters were interesting in this one.  They were the most interesting people since Tommy Jarvis in Part VI.  The virtual reality camp crystal lake at the end was perfect!!!  And the two topless young girls to occupy Jason were hilarious.  ""We gonna drink and smoke pot and maybe have some sex.  We'll just be in the sleeping bags right now.""  That was classic and great comedy relief and a great tribute to earlier movies.  I was expected one of two things when the Virtual Reality camp crystal lake.  I was hoping that they would VR Pamela Vorhees (Jason's mother) to the campsite.  It would have made Jason more human again, and we know deep down Jason was a ""Mama's Boy"".  The other thing they could have done was VR either Tommy Jarvis from part VI or Adrienne King from Part I & II or others from earlier films to confuse or occupy Jason.  But they went for the more commic relief.  Plus, I never mind seeing a couple of young girl's breasts.The ending promised our typical setup for another movie on Planet Earth 2 (I assume) at a campsite.  It was expected, but done well.  If you're a fan of the genre or just the Friday the 13th movies, I would suggest going to see it for 2 reasons. 1) It's a pretty entertaining and interesting movie. 2) If it does well enough at the box office, we are certain the see the long awaited movie ""Freddy -vs- Jason"".  New Line Cinema has been working on the project for a while, but are waiting to see how well Jason X does in the theaters.In future Friday movies, I'd love to see a ""prequel"" of sorts.  Explain what happened to Jason's father.  What happened from the 1950s until the early 1980s when Jason started killing in Part II.  And so on.My Friday The 13th Ranking System.  (Best to Worst)1) Part VI: Jason Lives.  Great story, great characters.2) Part I: The original...but no Jason until the end.  But great suspense.3) Part IX: The director's cut is so gruesome, but great story.4) Jason X: Yes, this actually makes it up to #4 on the list.5) Part III: The 3-D was campy and dated.  But this in my mind was the scariest of all the Friday the 13th movies.  I saw this when I was 10 years old and I couldn't sleep for weeks after.  I just kept seeing that scene where Chris (who was one of the cutest Friday girls ever) after she hangs Jason walks up to his dangling corpse and Jason awakes, lifting his hockey mask, and flashing that dimented smile.6) Part IV: The beginning of Tommy Jarvis!!!7) Part VII: I didn't get into the whole Tina thing.8) Part II: Basically a re-hashing of Part I with Jason doing the killing instead.9) Part VIII: Jason takes Manhattan was terrible.  I assumed this was the end of the Friday series.  Luckily New Line bought the rights from Paramount and Sean S. Cunningham came back.  This movie was so bad that Sean S. Cunningham started Part IX to begin after Part VII and just ignored the 8th. (I read also that Sean S. Cunningham said Part IX really starts after Part II...because he didn't like any of the sequels after the 2nd.  Hence that's why we don't hear any reference to Tina or Tommy Jarvis in the last two movies.)  This movie was terrible.  Jason didn't end up in New York until the very end of the movie.  The New Yorkers, one of which I am, were so cliche.  And I never saw Nuclear Waste in the sewers. Hmmmmm.10) Part V: One reason.  No Jason.  Stupid plot of some guy killing like Jason for revenge.  Only good scene was the part where the guy is killed in the Port-A-Potty.",Jason X
339,Desslok,Gloriously stupid and some dumb fun,10,26 April 2002,"First, let us get this right out of the way. This is not King Lear. This is not Casablanca or Citizen Kane. There is no high drama or good acting expected in any Friday the 13th Movie. Anyone going in expecting anything in this list is going to be disappointed. Hard core.What we do expect: fine young females showing some titties, having sex and drinking beer. We expect to see some hard core murder performed in unique and interesting ways. We want buckets of blood as Jason fulfills his roll as an unstoppable killing machine. Little details like plot and character development get in the way of what we paid our money to see: Death and lots of it.Given that - how does Jason X stack up? It's an absolutely bad movie in just about every respect imaginable - and it's perfect.It's got all kind of interesting death in it - the first one on the spaceship with the liquid nitrogen springs to mind. The problem is that it hits you with probably the best death right off the bat - so there is some pacing issues with the way the murders play out, but it's hardly something to get worked up over.The movie has the highest body count of any previous Friday the 13th movie - at least 20, with the potential of several thousand if you count the space station that Jason blew up. Those looking for a visceral good time will have everything they want - in spades.The writing is even clever at times. Case in point, the bait used to distract Jason while the heroes get away (to say more would give away far too much).  Suffice it to say that this is a damn funny scene, probably the best moment in the movie. Me and my crew were on the floor laughing so hard I had trouble paying attention to the rest of the movie.
I was afraid that sly and pretentious films like Scream and Scary Movie had destroyed the horror genre forever with their ""Nudge, nudge - look how clever WE are"" approach to the old school 80's slasher flick. Fear not - this movie trumps those films live never before. I was worried that a series of movies that was over TWENTY years old - teenagers who saw these films on Showtime and HBO in the dark well after they were suppose to have gone to bed who now have teenagers of their own - had nowhere else to go, had no gas left in the franchise. I couldn't have been more wrong.In short, if you liked Friday the 13th 1-9, then part 10 will rock your world.",Jason X
340,charmedgirl81,What the?????,3,30 April 2002,"Well I went to see the movie `Jason X', I guess I got excited for no reason. The movie was nothing but a dull-21stcentury-futuristic-unrealistic story line. So Jason goes to space and becomes this Terminator wannabe..right. Anyways, it is needless to say that my friend spent the whole movie cracking up while some others were being `scared' out of their wits and I was trying to make sense of the plot. There was a big lack of character and of course plot. I must admit that I was more jumpy while watching `Resident Evil' which actually a plot and characters and made sense. If you have never seen a Jason movie before like me, and are anxious to see it, don't rush, it will be worth your money much more when it comes out in video stores.Peace!",Jason X
341,jack-frost,Friday the 13th: fast and furious style,10,10 August 2002,"As Alice COOPER sang it during the end credits of JASON LIVES: ""He's back, the man behind the mask"" for his best carnage since FRIDAY THE 13TH: THE NEW BLOOD that introduced the stunt man Kane HODDER as the definitive incarnation of Jason VOORHEES.For the second time, Jason returns after what was supposed to be the final chapter of the never-ending saga, and for the second time, he gets an upgrade.In JASON LIVES (the real follow up to THE FINAL CHAPTER), he became a living dead with an increased strength and an invulnerability to fire and bullets.Now, we get the Uber-Jason, a cross between the TERMINATOR and the killer of Crystal Lake.After the disappointment brought by JASON GOES TO HELL: THE FINAL FRIDAY in which the killer was represented as a parasite with the ability to possess bodies and, as a result, allowed us to see Jason in his real shape for only two minutes at the beginning and five at the end, it's good to see that the hockey mask's back during the entire movie. When you watch a FRIDAY THE 13TH film, you want to see Jason, his mask and his big knife, not a guy trying to imitate Kane HODDER. It's good to bring fresh blood to a story that reaches its ninth entry but turning Jason into the cousin of ""THE HIDDEN"" wasn't the appropriate way to do it.So here's JASON X, a film where the star is the man behind the mask. More than in any other FRIDAY movie, Jason is treated as a myth, a horror legend. Jim ISAAC has made very cool shots of him where he looks very threatening. The opening sequence, with the close-ups on Jason's eyes when he's watching the lab-assistant are superb as you feel all the inner rage of the monster. This is one of best sequences that ever appeared in a FRIDAY THE 13TH movie, really impressive.However, the film isn't very scary but I don't think it aimed at making you jump out of your seat with terror. No, JASON X is to FRIDAY THE 13TH what BRIDE OF CHUCKY was to CHILD'S PLAY: a fun,fast and wildly furious adventure built around the main character, really seen as an icon, that both respects and wants to break free of the other episodes. In a nutshell, FRIDAY THE 13TH fans might be a bit disappointed, but if their main interest wasn't gratuitous nudity and ""serious"" gore but Jason VOORHEES, then it should be a dream come true.The screenplay's very simple but shows a real sense of rythm. There's plenty of very exciting situations with lots of gore and action. Here, there's no endless chases: Jason's more brutal than ever and doesn't waste his time with his victims.But the real gift of this film is its sense of humour, very respectful toward Jason and the slasher movies in general (unlike SCREAM) that is aimed essentially at the fans of the series. Some dialogues are bound to become cult and a scene involving Uber-Jason and a virtual Crystal Lake is a pure jewel. It made me laugh so hard...There's even a little reference to John CARPENTER's DARK STAR at the end.As a conclusion, let's say that although it's not a typical FRIDAY THE 13TH movie, JASON X stands along with JASON LIVES as the best entry in the series. It's a wild ride every Jason fan should enjoy. Don't listen to bad critics, this film really rocks: JASON'S BACK!!!",Jason X
342,cbjib,"""This sucks on so many levels""",4,2 July 2002,"Well now. I just got the opportunity of watching Jason X and what can i say? Well, American Beauty it aint. Standard B-grade slasher fodder, though most of the killings were done offscreen, which surprised me. I've never been a fan of superflous gore, but I can't really call this scary. Über-Jason was sort of cool though. And I sort of liked the cheesy oneliners and lame references (BFG!!!) .

Yeah, the holo-deck scene with the campsite was funny, but so was the rest of the movie, when it didn't mean to be. The music was very poor, the acting was awful, and the scene where Jason turns into Uber-Jason is pointless. If the ending of this film indicated the making of an 11th film, the Jason movie fans should hang themselves in shame. Out of a 10, I give this a 0.1, only because of Lexa Doig.",Jason X

Upon seeing it for the 2nd time I realized how horrible this movie was. First off Jason in space? We have all learned from the past that space slashers don't work. If you don't believe me watch Hellrasier: Bloodlust or Leprechaun in space. There were some cool death scenes and this movie had a huge over the top body count. The character Kinsa was annoying with her endless whining and crying. The acting was horrible, and that one guy who was hooking up with the robot looked like an elf version of Matthew Perry. On the other hand Lexa Doig was great! Her character was kind of blah, but she was the best looking heroine of all the friday the 13th films. Anyway Jason X is the worst friday the 13th film of the past 9. I think I liked part 5 better than this one and that one sucks too. Don't pay money to see this movie. Jason died after Manhattan, and new line should have just made Freddy vs. Jason. I heard that movie won't get made unless Jason X does well. That sucks since I went on saturday at the night showing with about 15 people in the theatre.",Jason X

The movie's beginning actually made the film look worthy to me. Then, new people in a spaceship ""transport"" to Jason's frozen body and start getting killed.

Effects- 75% Storyline- 23% Acting- 0% (absolutely horrible to the point that it's funny) Overall- 30% out of 100% This movie deserves this harsh rating. Just do yourself a favor and skip this!

348,madspike212,"Can be watched, Ending lets down",5,24 December 2012,"I agree totally with the previous review. He is completely right in the fact it is what it is... A slasher flick. It holds the usual early flash of flesh before the real part of it begins and will look for many different ways to maim the victims inside the film. However; in accordance with the ""News of the World"" on the casing it was ""FANTASTIC"". This I really have to disagree on. *SPOILER ALERT* The ending was truly ruined for me in many ways. The ass kicking android, the fact Jason was upgraded and the very end itself where somehow Brodski whisks in to save the day! Seriously?! Also the music added little suspense; rather a comical twist as it seemed somewhat provided by one man and a very expensive keyboard.Although the only flavor that can be accepted in this film is the kill scenes itself (where some do feel lacking) it is still O.K to watch if you have nothing better to do. It will keep your attention though stimulation may hinder from time to time and you will be somewhat entertained.I give it a 5 because I do enjoy the Jason selection. Even though this one is one of the worse, as a fan boy I have to back it somewhere. If you like the series, by all means give it a go. If you aren't a fan boy, steer clear.",Jason X

350,WirelessE,Jason is lost in space,2,17 August 2015,"The Jason Voorhees of the 1980's is well gone, as the Friday the 13th series is taken into a sci-fi realm. Looking like it was filmed in a tacky '90's laser quest arena; the film contains a myriad of my pet peeves from later day horrors including terrible CGI and a huge cast of indistinct characters devoid of personality who wisecrack on their deathbed. It is lame on every level, with bad acting, and a dire script. I could overlook some of this if it was entertaining. However it is minute after minute of people walking down spaceship corridors, spouting sci-fi gobbledygook into headsets or talking into computer monitors about how to open doors or land the craft that no one on board appears to know how to operate. Inexcusably Jason's not really very noticeable. He does have a Terminator style makeover which was briefly mildly amusing. Overall he is involved in the dullest set of deaths, non-scares and chases the series has seen. There was a glimmer of a good idea near the end where Jason was placed in a virtual reality Crystal Lake but that was quickly squandered. Potentially the set-up could have worked in more talented hands, but it remains a rancid turd which feels as if it was written by someone with no love for horror (or even sci-fi) films.

353,JCarl01,The best film in the series...and James Cameron will probably sue.,9,5 February 2002,"JASON X is a terrific, fast-paced, big-budget sci-fi/action movie that---silly plot synopsis aside---shouldn't work, yet does.  And why shouldn't it work?  Unlike previous entries in the series, this isn't a horror film.  It's a rip-off of James Cameron's ALIENS (1986), although now starring Kane Hodder as Jason Voorhees instead of those nasty, overgrown roaches with piranha teeth.  I watched this film in stunned disbelief.  I suspect that New Line Cinema's decision to postpone the film's US Theatrical release has nothing to do with the film's quality. (It shouldn't, because the movie is very good.) Instead, I wonder if JASON X is being withheld because New Line is still processing the shock of reading its name atop the ""Eagerly Awaited"" column in Cameron's logbook of upcoming court dates.  Not since Universal Pictures wiped GREAT WHITE off the face of God's green earth has there been such an opportunity to burn the master negative of a reported $13.5 million dollar motion picture.JASON X doesn't settle for lifting and reworking certain scenes from Cameron's space classic.  Oh no, it does so much more.  What do you call a movie that not only recreates the mood, setting and characters from someone else's original screenplay, but then also insists on lifting actual dialogue from that same screenplay and passing it off as its own?  How is it possible that director Jim Isaacs unknowingly staged entire segments of JASON X with his actors framed in the same proximity to the camera as in Cameron's film? And what's the defense when these actors physically react to these situations in exactly the same manner as the cast of Cameron's original?  I do not dare whisper the words, homage or spoof, because I have indeed seen the films of John Sayles and, in my opinion, a spoof is something the Zuckers Brothers are hired to do.  What we have here is something deliciously more akin to swiping your dad's credit card and using it to buy yourself a home theatre system with THX SurroundSound.  It's fun while it lasts, but sooner than later you're gonna get nailed by the higher-ups. And yet, I'm so pleased with the results of JASON X that I'm damned if I don't want the silly thing to break $100 million at the box office, if only to read how James Cameron copes with it.Let me say that JASON X does not begin promisingly.  The film opens with one of those standard attack sequences in which our heroine races from one darkened set to another, while Jason dispatches a quarter of the Screen Actors Guild and violins screech in the background.  I doubt whether such a high-security government facility would have truly allowed an imprisoned psychopath to continue wearing his hockey mask, but what the hell.  Jason gets cryogenically frozen and the film skips four hundred years into the future.  Before long, a group of teens on a field trip from ""Earth 2"" are dumping Jason's frozen carcass onto their orbiting spaceship, and never thinking twice about the bloody machete still clutched in his oversized mitts.  (In all fairness, they do observe that hockey was a violent sport outlawed in 2010.) Did I forget to mention that our dark-haired heroine was also cryogenically frozen in the same room with Jason and has now been rescued, too?  Or that the spaceship is filled with a rowdy band of Marines armed with enough firepower to overthrow a small Republic?  Or that there's an android aboard?  Or that the expedition's leader turns out to be a greedy entrepreneur with selfish motives?  This is not a movie that wastes time with creating new storylines, not when laying a piece of onion skin over somebody else's work and carbon-copying it idea-for-idea will suffice. Once Jason wakes up with a truly hateful headache, however, the film finally closes its eyes and steps on the gas.  It was at this point, I do suspect, a silly grin spread across my face.Take the scene, for example, where the Marines find themselves stalking Jason in a cargo room that's roughly the same size as that warehouse at the end of RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK.  The teens, huddled elsewhere on the ship, are monitoring this same track-and-pursuit by listening to the conversations being broadcast over the loudspeakers.  (Don't ask why.)  We're not stupid. We know that Jason is going to skewer every person in that cargo room.  We know this because we've been around a while.  We've seen a few horror flicks, maybe some sequels.  And of course we've seen ALIENS.  Jason finally does attack, while the camera zooms around corners and our heroine demands ""Get your men out of there!"", and walkie-talkies squawk about copy this and copy that.  And I didn't care a smidgen about how James Cameron did it better or that I was watching a rip-off, because the scene worked.  In fact, it rocked.And much later, when a new-and-improved Jason Voorhees strides through a shattered doorway, out of the smoke, as if daring you to make one more ALIENS reference, I knew this film had blindsided me.  It's a moment as cinematically thrilling as when Sigourney Weaver finally confronts the Queen, delivering the line quoted 'round the world.   And why shouldn't it work?  After all, it's the exact same scene.Yes, JASON X ought to be ashamed.  Perhaps I should be embarrassed for being so easily amused.  And yet, credit must be given to the filmmakers for attempting something unique---now nine sequels into the series---when the same tired storyline would have probably earned as much money.  Yes, the film has flaws.  The first half-hour shows severe signs of tampering in the editing room, including an awful sex scene between a student and teacher that feels like a filmed memo from the Audience Research Department to the screenwriter.  (This particular moment almost collapses the movie.)  On the other hand, the final three minutes of JASON X are everything that a certain 2001 re-imagining claimed to be, without involving apes on motorcycles. This is the best film in the series.So, we've been to Camp Crystal Lake.  We've been to hell.  We've even been to space.  For the next installment, I suggest the filmmakers now further Jason's adventures.  I've heard there's this little-known art-house film about an island overrun by dinosaurs...",Jason X
354,mindgap007,Exceeds all expectations... roll on Jason XI,9,21 July 2002,"After the rather disappointing Jason Goes To Hell, I was almost fearing the worst as soon as I heard New Line were going to take Jason Voorhees quite literally into outer space.  A laughable idea surely, and a desperate one at that.  After much delay though, I finally got to see the movie on July 20th 2002 at a UK cinema no less, the first time a Friday The 13th movie has been released on the big screen here since the pretty awful Part V: A New Beginning back in 1985.  So, first of all, hats off to New Line and Entertainment Film for having the guts to give a tenth film in a slasher series a cinema run in the UK!To say director Jim Issac overcomes the shortcomings of the initial idea, is a bit of an understatement.  Thanks largely to Todd Farmer's competent and sometimes witty script, Issac is able to keep things moving at a good tempo, utilising the larger scope of ""Jason in space"" to come up with some superb set pieces, and a visual style that is far more impressive than anybody has really given it credit for.  A knowing, but mostly controlled sense of humour helps too, preventing the film from being swallowed up by its own outlandish storyline, meaning the final barrage of over the top action during the last 20 minutes work a treat.  Sure, it all becomes rather laughable, but then the film makers are in on the joke too.I can't really understand why so many have attacked the acting either.  I mean, what were we all expecting?  Laurence Olivier or Anthony Hopkins to pop up?  Or maybe, Al Pacino as Jason?  Come on people.  This is a low budget movie, with a young mostly unknown cast, and to be honest it's one of the best collected casts of the entire series (probably the best since Joseph Zito's ""The Final Chapter"").  Indeed, the cost of the film doesn't seem to hinder Issac's ambitions. Apart from the expected top class prothestics, the use of CGI for the space scenes is very impressive indeed ,particularly for a $15 million movie.Finally, a word for Kane Hodder.  Playing Jason for the fourth consectitive time, he's as imposing and serious as ever.  Whilst Farmer's script has fun with the trappings of the series (the jokes about premarital sex etc), never does he make fun of Jason, and Hodder's performance emphasisis this with some magnitude.  This must be the most screen time Jason has been allowed, and to Hodder's credit that despite his frequent on-screen time, he never looses his sense of menace - not once.  The film may not be that scary, but Hodder's Jason always had me glued to the screen.To be honest, Jason X is everything I hoped it would be, and more.  The only real damaging aspect of the film is Harry Manfredini's cheap sounding music score, which threatens to kill any menace Jason has.  If there is a Jason XI, I just hope another composer is hired, because as good as Manfredini's early Friday scores were, his last two, for Jason Goes To Hell, and now Jason X, have in all honesty been pretty dreadful.Placing it in with the rest of the series, it would probably be 3rd on the list, after the awesome ""The Final Chapter"", and the under-rated if flawed ""Jason Takes Manhattan"".  Great fun, just don't, as some people seem to be doing, expect Shakespeare.  Besides, Shakespeare was never this much fun.",Jason X
355,the thorn of Thurisaz,What crap!,7,1 May 2002,"Sitting through a short part of this film, I knew that this had to be one of the worst films of all time. One thing that bugs me is the continuity gap. Okay, so the series has not been exactly great in this faction, but the last time we saw Jason, he was being physically pulled into Hell (by the way, wasn't the title of that film Jason Goes to Hell: The FINAL Friday? I suppose that it was only in reference to the series' title and not the franchise itself). Well, we have to assume that this film exists in an alternative timeline because the film makes no reference to how the film's un-killable butcher is back now. The film starts in a not-too distant future where Jason has been captured and awaits some sort of sentence. The film is also unclear on how they managed to contain someone who has breathed in more bullets then a shooting range. Are we to assume that they triumphed where the Squat team from Jason Goes To Hell failed in blowing him away? The film clearly exits outside of how the rest of the series sets itself up. Either that or I believe that whomever wrote this film has never actually seen one of the Friday films; they just know enough that he is Jason Voorhees and that he kills kids who practice the prescription of drugs, alcohol and sex. The film is really a bad blend of the following: the self-conscious remarks of the characters from Scream, but minus the humour, wit and irony; every sloppy sci-fi film, especially Aliens; a bit of the Terminator films; the film also manages to rip itself off, there is a scene that recalls the sexual relationship between student and professor from VII: Jason takes Manhattan, as well as an updated version of the paintball game in part VI. Now if you can ignore all that, there is the fact that the dialog is lamer then anything I have heard. There is no plot (obviously), but the main point is that the film really p****d on a good concept and did just the same thing here and there. That Leprechaun in Space movie worked better then this. There is something about the depths of space that can turn any horror franchise into some of the most laughable pieces in cinema history. But mainly in this film (more so then in the Leprechaun film... a series that never really worked anyway in my opinion), the characters are twice as big as idiots. For a film using ideas such as cryogenics and a futuristic/outer space setting, nothing is really being done differently. The killings are boring with the exception of only one, which contains a freeze-dryer but even that doesn't escape predictability. The film tries to be funnier then the previous films and that means a lot of jokes, but only two are worth mentioning (hint: one is the adverts). Everything else, well, imagine every dumb thing kids did in the previous installments, then add some futuristic touches and you get the point. My only other gripe then a continuity loop is a character that gets frozen along with Jason. From the rumours I had heard, it sounded like she was a key figure to the story, possibly even holding a secret to Jason, like how to destroy him. I was wrong.  Her purpose in the film is highly questionable seeing as how she adds nothing to anything... but then again, who in this film actually does? At least if she were, it would make the film a lot more interesting. Maybe I should not overanalyze what is obviously a dumb film, but even dumb films work better then this. I have seen every film in the series and this is by far the worse. At least those films were acting out in an organic response to some characters and situations at times. The ending to this little forgettable romp is a bit unique, even interesting I have to admit, but only given the film's setting. It was a bit redemptive seeing as how it was about the only thing I remember. Actually, there is an interesting scene where Jason is in a hologram of Crystal Lake, but neither the taste of the joke and the scene itself last long enough to tide. However, all the little bits of simplistic mystique and guilty-pleasure back story from the rest of the films have been erased and leaves you not wanting more, but instead, wondering as to why they didn't makes you want more. At least the other films, as well as many other slashers, make it seem as though they are trying. Throw us some sort of bone and feed us something interesting. The only thing that makes me want to go see this again is the music playing in the end credits. I'm contemplating as to whether it's worth sitting through all that rubbish again just to listen to what I found to be a refreshing slasher score. But if there is one thing this installment teaches you, it's that no matter how far we advance in civilization with technology in the centuries to come, people will continue to behave asinine and take stupid actions when masked serial killers are on the loose. Let's just hope they can write better stories by then. I can only hope that Jason vs. Freddy is now the next agenda and that it will be worth the wait that this one couldn't promise.",Jason X
356,gutzngory,Intense and Refreshing...,8,8 October 2002,"I have seen all the Friday The 13th/Jason Films and just got done watching Jason X. I must say that in my opinion, this was a very action-packed installment with new elements introduced, adding a breath of fresh-air into the franchise. Kane Hodder, as always, is fantastic as Jason (He is to Jason Voorhees as Boris Karloff is to Frankenstein. Even though Hodder wasn't the original, he wears the character so well), and a supporting cast of new faces add to the excitement. Visuals are great and there is an excellent ""fight"" scene between sexy Android Kay-Em 14 (Lisa Ryder) and Mr. Jason, with edge-of-your-seat music to back it up. Harry Manfredini does a great music score for his 9th Jason film (he missed ""Jason Takes Manhattan"") and James Isaac does an excellent job as director. I don't know what movie the people who are bashing it saw, but I thought it was a great way of bringing Jason up-to-date to the 21st century.",Jason X
357,dethburger,So what the hell did you expect...,8,28 April 2002,"I've read a few reviews of this so far, some not exactly flattering, and all I can say is, ""What the hell did you expect?"". If I was to grade this film based on all films ever made then I'd give it a 3. If I was to base it just on the horror genre then I'd make it a 5. But seeing how this IS a ""Friday the Thirteenth"" film...not exactly high art, then I'd give it a solid 8. For what it is, it is probable the second most entertaining in the series. I would rate six as best. That was the first one to take the approach that this is all kind of a joke...the same as myself. I don't buy into people who have been shot 100 times (or worse) getting up and walking around. At least not over the period of time that the Jasons and Mike Myers have survived. You would bleed to death. In 6 he becomes un-dead. Now he's believable unstoppable. The next three films where lacking in imagination. This didn't... the only thing it really REALLY lacked was a budget. With H20 money they could get a couple of LL Cool J's Or Jamie Lees and maybe polish those limited F/X. Then, just like Halloween, BOOM! a re-invented money cow. (did you see the numbers on H2O's box office? YIKES!!)This film is a lot more fun than that one...""Lets smoke a joint and have pre-marital sex...weeee!!!""",Jason X

This movie made fun of itself and other scary movies with jason smiling with his eyes, and people making jokes while others get killed, and every girl in the movie is banging and wearing realy tight clothing.If you like a movie to be scary to not see this.  If you watch movies for strictly entertainment value and not for the ""cinemetography"" or acting or writing.  this is a good movie.This movie should be under comedy not horror when i go to rent it.",Jason X

Oh yeah jason's so good he gets a total of two videos and two dvds in movie rentals because they are so low budget.  Michal myers has a lot more than that.

365,Spencer-Pellegrino,I have mixed feelings on this movie,5,11 August 2010,"I don't hate this sequel nor do I love it. I do think that it was pointless to put Jason in space because the whole idea lead the series nowhere.In the last Friday The 13th movie Jason Goes To Hell: The Final Friday, Jason's full body goes straight into hell. Now all of a sudden this movie begins when Jason is captured in a place called the Crystal Cake Research Facility as if the last movie was ignored. When captured in the facility he looks nothing like he did in any of the other movies in the series, especially the mask and the whole research facility is keeping Jason's body because it was discovered that he can regenerate lost and damaged tissue. I dislike how they added this into the story because if Jason was really able to regenerate lost and damaged tissue why would does his skin look like such a wreck in the previous films? I think he would be able to look good as new if he could regenerate lost and damaged tissue if you ask me.What I did like about this movie is it did have some creative kills in it. Jason sticks a woman's face in below freezing water then smashes her face right on the counter and her whole face literally breaks apart.I did not like how Jason gets an upgrade in this movie simply because Jason with metal protection and fierce red eyes is not the Jason I know. I didn't find him creepy looking at all once this happened.This movie is not horrible nor is it great, it's mediocre. Not the best movie in the franchise but certainly not the worst.",Jason X
366,richy-12,The best of the series,7,25 October 2006,"I have seen about half of the Friday 13th series, and I cannot believe how low the IMDb rating is for this part.Jason X is by far the best part of the series. It is the only part that wont bore you to death; it is well produced and also the most entertaining one. It looks like the budget for this film was substantially higher than for the previous episodes, and it pays off.In this episode Jason gets resurrected in a spaceship in the distant future. Despite the technological progress, he just does not die and keeps killing people...Don't get me wrong though, this is not a film you must see. Probably only horror fans will enjoy it.",Jason X
367,DeathandTaxes22,The Worst of the Lot,1,16 January 2004,"It's hard to pick a worst in a series which has stood for all that is wrong with some horror movies. I will admit however, that I do get a small nihilistic thrill out of some of the entries in the series. When you don't wish to think or watch a good movie, they can be a somewhat pleasant diversion if you are predisposed to such things. That being said there are no thrills in this movie. It is a bad Alien rip off, but if you forget the killer is Jason it also feels like a Friday the 13th rip off. The acting is worse than usual, or maybe the bad acting is less forgivable due to the budget of the film. It's hard to say. The only decent(that might be too positive of word)thing about the film is the Crystal Lake holo sequence. It's a mildly clever poke at a serious that takes itself too seriously most of the time. The film makers thought that updating the story with ""futuristic"" touches would save the series, but honestly it might be a nail in the coffin that Freddy vs. Jason needed to pull back out. 1/5",Jason X

It really does ruin the series of Friday the 13th. I really don't get what the director and writer were thinking when they thought this would be a good idea. If they have to make a horror film make your own up don't ruin a good series. i truly hope someone was fired or ridiculed for making this poor excuse of a film. awful,poo,worst film ever,shocking need i say more,,,,,,DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM",Jason X

What was the writer of this movie thinking when he was writing it, is very awful, stupid, ridiculous, that ever the own Jason could possibly hate this movie.It's really the wost movie ever made, just for th fact of the story, and if this is a real horror movie, where lost.

371,jlarton,A strong outing overall.,6,30 January 2002,"This film was quite enjoyable for the most part.  The initial action scene involving Jason an some local marine grunts (w. Cronenberg) really pumps the viewer up.  Jason is quicker and more realistic in this film, and Kane Hodder breathes life into the mass murderer in many subtle, yet effective ways (eg. mannerisms, eye contact, etc.).  The acting in the film was surprisingly strong for this type of film, but no one takes the subject matter too seriously.  Likewise, the special effects are used sparingly, but the sets are very atmospheric.  This episode has a budget of $14 million dollars, and I can safely say that the money was well spent.  The tone of the film is now a chase film, as opposed to a slasher film - and I believe this was necessary at this stage in the series because a rehash of the previous films would insult any self-respecting horror film fanatic's intelligence (I think?).  The comedy that is interspersed throughout the film is in fact 'not' annoying this time out.  I only have two concerns - (a) Now that the bar has been raised to such a high level (in Jason standards)- how do you top Jason X? (b) Now that Jason is 'Uber-Jason' - how do you continue that aspect of the character into the next sequels? (You need Kane Hodder of course - but what if you want to have Jason back in the sticks?)  In all - bravo, but too short a film (could have been 2 hours in length).",Jason X

""For a while"" is the key phrase. At first, the movie annoyed me, with the remarks made about Jason, and how there's no explanation of the crossover from the last movie till now. The whole movie is great though most of the time, until we get to the robot part. I'm being vague to not spoil anything, but basically, once the robot-Jason takes form, the movie is officially done. It was totally a let-down and over-blow of a great story. The producers didn't know when to quit. Do what I should have done, before Jason becomes the robot, leave, and stay at piece with yourself, thinking that the movie ends there.",Jason X
374,forbidden,A Real Waste,1,25 April 2002,"I'm not sure how films like this get greenlighted but whoever gave this one the thumbs up ought to be diced up by Jason himself.  I love a good slasher when I see it but this film fails to even deliver the ocassional cheap scare.  It seems to have been made as a campy installment to the classic series but the humor is so dull.  It had so many rip off scenes from other films, most notably Alien, that it seems no effort was put into it creatively.  No effort at all on any level.  Of course there were laughs but laughs at the films expense (what's with the costumes?)  I plead with those responsible for this film just, please, to let Jason die already and come up with a new super-villain.",Jason X

It's a completely crazy horror flick that knows exactly what it is, a ridiculous attempt at bringing back a dead series.  Surprisingly, it works! The way that it makes fun of itself adds to the overall effect.  and the script itself was fabulous, the way they brought back old ideas was ingenious.  I can't recommend this movie enough.

Who in their right mind green lit this.  I can't find one good aspect about Jason X.  The special effects were subpar, the acting was horrible except for the gorgeous lead played by Lexa Doig.  Kane Hodder returns as Jason and he did his normal job as Voorhees.  The space marines honestly had the worst dialogue in the film and their weapons looked like something NERF sponsored.  I really hope New Line would just make the Freddy vs. Jason and have them both killed by Chucky or something.",Jason X

379,Zfire9969,Jason kicks better ass in space then at the lake...,10,26 April 2002,"Going where others have failed (in space), Jason Voorhees delivers. In Jason X, the movie starts off in the Crystal Lake Research Center where Lexa Doig's character Rowan is a doctor studying Jason and his ability to regenerate cells (which explains why he can't really die). After an escape and a slaughter of guards Jason ends up tricked into a cryogenic freezing chamber where he and Rowan get frozen.Now over 400 hundred years later when Earth is uninhabitable, a group of research students discover the pair and bring them aboard their ship to thaw them out and take them to Earth II. This is when trouble strikes as Jason awakes just a little more than pissed off. He destroys a team of soldiers and walks about the ship slaying anyone in his path. The remaining few must work together and stop him.Jason X is the first horror sequel to give proper justice to the space setting. After both Pinhead and the Leprechaun failed miserably, he comes through for us and entertains throughout the movie. Kane Hodder is just a beast as he tears through each of his victims with some of the coolest death scenes to date. Aside from the abnormally large but greatly appreciated body count, the entire cast as a whole entertained. Good acting by all, especially from Doig. Going into this movie a giant fan of the Friday the 13th series and not expecting too much, I must say it quickly became tied for my favorite (right up there with number 6 - Jason Lives). The humor was played well and the upgraded Uber Jason was just damn sweet!What are you waiting for... go see it!",Jason X

From the inventive killings, and the creation of Uber-Jason to the fact that he ended up in space in the year 2455. I must also compliment the addition of Sergeant Brodski, one of the toughest men i've ever seen in a Sci-Fi/Horror film.

The scene with Jason at Camp Crystal Lake nearly had me p***ing my pants.  The whole film is so totally ridiculous you can't help but laugh.  There are a few generally suspensful/scary moments (Jason stalking the marines was probably the best), but mostly, the film was just silly.  There were some truly great one-liners, some inventive murders (liquid-nitrogen, the screw), though I nearly vomited when one marine had her throat slit (the sound was hideous). And the movie ends with one of the characters riding Jason 'into the sunset'.  Could a movie get any better?",Jason X
382,egwern,Someone should make a Jason vs Jar Jar Binks movie set against Alien Resurrection.,3,29 April 2002,"Just saw Jason X . . . It is bad. No big surprise there. However, it is dull, dull, dull. Now, that is a shocker. I really didn't see much point in setting the movie 500 years in the future. Really, even with the decent sci-fi special effects, Jason X is a re-hash of every other Friday the 13th film. It doesn't capitalize upon its backdrop. In the end, the time period is little more than a gimmick.
The audience is promised something new and special. However, the flick doesn't deliver the goods. Instead of a fresh spin upon the series (think Wes Craven's New Nightmare or Bride of Chucky) Jason X is Friday the 13th parts 3,4,5,6 and Jason Goes to New York rolled into one movie.
The picture name drops and hints at other genre pictures (the likes of Alien and Solaris are referenced). Still, is that really all that clever?
Furthermore, the cast is loaded with aspiring young mannequins who fail to breath the smallest amount of life into the underwritten roles. Truthfully, halfway through Jason X, I could not even remember the names of the victims-in-waiting. Okay, I know that people go to these movies for the high body count. To be sure, Jason X delivers in this area. Well over 20 people meet their timely deaths in this film. Still, so many characters are sliced and diced, the proceedings become tedious after about 12 minutes. One scene places Jason inside a virtual reality simulation of Camp Crytal Lake, circa 1980. Finally (three quarters of the way through!!!) Jason X shows a genuine sense of humor. If the rest of the movie displayed the same spirit, it would be a winner. Instead, it rates a three out of ten.",Jason X

Even if you don't know how the rest of the series is this movie pretty much sums it up and adds quality where it was needed.This movie includes the action expected. There's lots of death and murder, but with a futuristic touch.I recommend this movie to those who enjoy those qualities that I've previously stated, and just the right amount of comedy :)Of course there are those unrealistic aspects that are present in all of this series - but it's to be expected, that's how this series works!It's what you would expect from this particular series - mixed in with a bit of Alien. Go out and see it! It's definitely worth the money, if for nothing else than to enjoy the comical futuristic touch that separates it so much from the rest of the series :)",Jason X

It was cool when I first saw it but then was just stupid. they were going to do this with Halloween also but they didn't. The only reason this movie gets away with anything is because they were trying to make Freddy vs Jason and ran into some problems so they made this movie for the wait. When Uber Jason comes out you know this movie just got a lot worse. So how did the government get a hold of him? I doubt they just walked up to him, read him his rights put him in handcuffs then threw him in the back of a FBI van. It's like a Jason version of Alien: Resurrection. The robot vs Jason went to far and was just ridiculous. It has some parts where even Jason would be smart to know that a location is fake. Such as the Crystal Lake Simulation. When You have metal walls instead of rocks doesn't that strike you as odd? It was one of those films where its so bad you like it.",Jason X

Because this is not.To be honest, it's not got the biggest budget and at the tenth in a series, you won't really find incredible Oscar-winning actors, hence some of the acting remains a bit dodgy at parts throughout the film. Neither will you get awesome special effects and CGI, which this doesn't.However, if you love an insane story-line and lots of gore and murder and menace then this one delivers, and it delivers well. Kane Hodder as Jason definitely delivers the hulking figure and menace that Voorhees has and he does it so well. It's an action-packed hour and a half and not to be taken too seriously. So if you sit back and don't put too much thought into it, it's really quite enjoyable. I certainly did.Sit back and relax....",Jason X

It does have plot holes and it is pointless to put Jason in space but it is entertaining as hell. The movie is more or less a parody of the other Friday the 13th movies and it is very funny when it wants to be. My main problem with the movie is the bland and uninteresting characters which are just their to die. The only interesting characters are Bronsky and the android. The end is brilliant and is reminiscent of the other Friday the 13th movies. The kills are very uncreative. The only kill that is very creative and brutal is the first one Jason makes is space. All in all it is not for everyone but it is very entertaining and fun.,Jason X

But after a few centuries, accidentally a space ship finds the ship that Jason is inside, and again accidentally awakes him. Jason once again does what he does best and slicing everyone on the ship. Besides all the technology the humans have, this ship has only have automatic rifles even older than the US army now using.The worst moment was when the cyborg was modified, she kills Jason. But what the heck, all those frozen years has given Jason the ability to modify himself with any electrical cable that is not isolated.

Nothing is at all realistic, the lines are cheesy, the acting is bad, Uber Jason????? What? I want to know who the editor was that looked at the final version of this movie and said ""This looks good, I think we're finished."" If I ever meet him, I'll slap him.The plot is terrible. Absolutely terrible. A bunch of people on a spaceship in the future find a frozen man with a machete. They now have some technology that re-animates frozen people. The captain of the ship talks to his ""boss"", who tells him to bring Jason back and make money off him. The captain knows that it is Jason Vorhees, but wakes him up anyway. A series of badly choreogrpahed slashings ensue and....well, you get the point.When I saw this movie, I laughed the whole way through. Not at their unfunny jokes, but at the fact that someone could make a movie so bad, and still take themselves seriously. I only suggest watching this movie if your cable is out and the only movie in your house is Jason X, and you are in the mood to laugh at someone. But seriously, I'm surprised that the filmmakers could sit through this and say ""Wow, this is turning out well.""",Jason X
392,MacBest,"Screamingly funny, but throw away every logical thought!",7,26 July 2001,"Contains spoiler I have to say, that I only saw parts 1 and 2 of this series and didn't like them very much. So my expectations were quite low! Of course, I also didn't expect an original story or really good actors. But I failed! With a Bodycount higher than most other Horror-Movies Jason works his way back on screen into an era of hightech- and just-for-fun-murderers. So this movie comes very self-ironic and funny, not just because the kills are very original, but also because of the unusual location and atmosphere. For an example: Jason throws a soldier onto some pile, nothing new. But after a few seconds, the corpse starts to turn on the pile and the pile appears as a screw were the corpse is now screwed... (I hope I was able to explain it quite well, in spite of my weak english...) So, I had a lot of fun, and if voting would already be accessible, I would give this movie a 7, just for all this fun and those really, really, really cool murder scenes! Go and watch it!",Jason X

I haven't seen all movies, though. I also think it's good they dropped the ""Friday"" in the title. It's all about Jason since part II anyway. If you want to know why slasher movies are barely made anymore, watch this movie: It's as mindless as it can get. Jason's there. He's invincible. He's murdering. No reason given for anything. He's just doing it. Don't wonder about anything, they won't explain it. Don't think the plot makes sense. Don't even expect a working story. It's all not important. The only thing you can hope for in slasher movies are cool, different locations, some brief nudity and different ways of killing people. And in this aspect, Jason X rocks. High budget. Cool sets. Cool special effects. Tons of gore and Jason slashes his evil heart out to the extreme with some very cool death scenes. I mean, freezing the head of a person, and then smashing this frozen head to pieces? Geez, who's getting such ideas. The thing Jason's doing with the sleeping bags gets a clever reprise. As far as I know, he did this in another part.
*minor spoilers*Also, Jason's not killing helpless civilians (students, read teenagers) only, but also has to deal with highly trained soldiers and a harmless bot, which got upgraded to a mean fighting machine (""'fraid I'm gonna have to hurt you now.""). By the way, I absolutely love this bot. Witty remarks and an actress who obviously enjoyed her play. If you absolutely hate this movie, at least fast forward to the fight Jason vs. bot. It's the best scene of the movie. The end of the movie manages it in a believable way to get back on ""earth"". You even hear the typical ""Friday, 13th"" music... doors for the next part are open wide.Jason X is stealing from a lot of movies. Critters IV comes to mind, which is also based in a space-ship in the future. Also I think of Aliens (highly equipped soldiers dying, and a civilian yelling ""Get them out of there!""), Aliens IV (existing monster gets reborn into an ""uber monster"") and Matrix (costume design of soldiers/bot, character gets martial arts training uploaded). The story is extremely stupid, and I think just watching this movie my IQ lowered some points, but it was fun to watch... and this is the most important thing, isn't it?

And to tell you the truth, I was pleasantly surprised.There are some things in the movie that are really predictable (just as you'd think) but there're some good parts too.

396,Mcclane101,Best Slasher flick ever made,7,29 April 2002,"Let me start by saying I don't like horror movies. I think they are trite gorefests whose only appeal is seeing people die in disgusting ways. A friend talked me into going to see Jason X, and I went to the matinee. Jason X was everything one expects from a slasher film- blood and guts, bad acting, cheesy music- but it was by far funnier than any slasher film I've seen. It never takes itself seriously, and that is the beauty of it. The characters don't seem to care that they are about to be killed as long as they can say some sarcastic remark before they get axed. Some of the deaths were inventive and a scene with two crystal lake camp counselors is the funniest thing I've seen at the movies all year. Don't see this movie if you are looking for award winning cinema, but I would recommend this for people looking for an entertaining movie.",Jason X
397,caracho,This movie rocks!,9,15 August 2001,"I just saw the unrated and uncut version of this movie in a large cinema with over 1000 seats filled mostly with Jason fans, and I must say that this movie rocks. It has everything you would expect from a Friday the 13th movie... and more. Plenty of gore scenes, some funny and selfironic stuff, a lot of allusions to the other jason movies, many sexy dressed chicks and a really evil Jason on a killing spree. This is definitely one of the best Jason movies. When I first heard about this movie, I had my doubts about the futuristic theme, but it suits the movie very well (unlike Hellraiser IV) and adds some fresh ideas to the Friday the 13th series. Even the Terminator/Robocop like Jason at the end of the movie fits in well. If you're a fan of this genre, go watch it in a theater as soon as you can and definitely buy the DVD (but only if they release this uncut version)!",Jason X

399,trumpetwolf,A Good Classic Flick!,7,13 March 2002,"I saw the trailer.  The first thought that came to my mind was critters, alien resurrection and a few other... ""Take it to Space"" thrillers.  Most movies of this nature aren't really all that great.  It is the same story... ""Get trapped in space, must fight to survive.""This movie followed that, but the bad ass characters that normally make it through the movie died really fast in the beginning of the movie, leaving the weak to fend for themselves.  Again, Jason kills and can't be killed as in all the Friday the 13th movie.I watched the movie and to say the least, I enjoyed it.  It wasn't scary, but it kept in line with some classic themes and this time Jason took no prisoner and really showed how intelligent he was considering ""He has such a small brain.""  If you watch the movie, you'll get the ""brain"" part.Go and see it, it is worth the view.",Jason X
400,Siegfried_Eracktor,Surprisingly good!,7,17 August 2002,"This film really surprised me in a good way! I mean, okay, the story is pretty dull (Jason is now in space and becomes a half-robot), but - Friday the 13th movies have never been something for the intelligent among us, have they? In fact, Jason X is much better than the most of its predecessors. The actors aren't really good - but, on the other hand, they're a way better than the actors from, say, ""Friday the 13th 4"". The effects are really cool, especially the splatter effects (at best on the Europian DVD (NC-17 rating!). But the best thing about this film is the humor: There are lots of references to the earlier FT13th films (just watch the Virtual Reality scene near the end - hilarious!) and some funny dialogues. All in all, much more worth watching it than the most of us horror fans have expected.",Jason X
401,hawthorne007,Without doubt the best of all the sequels...,10,26 December 2002,"I left the cinema after watching Jason X in stitches. Having seen nearly all of the Friday the 13th series and been more and more disappointed with the efforts of each it was fantastic to see a film take itself so lightly. As usual there was a fair amount of gore and teenage lust but the script has some, without trying to sound clichéd, killer jokes. The acting left a lot to be desired but this has come to be expected with this particular slasher series. The story is based around the context that Jason has been frozen in cryogenic stasis while the world around him has fallen to pieces and mankind has deserted the earth. That of course doesn't stop some meddling students on an interstellar field trip finding and defrosting him. Great idea kids! The result is a fiendishly funny and not entirely unscary film. It has its moments of corny dialogue (man falls on top of giant screw and twists down it - ""he's screwed"" is the line) but this is offset by some laugh out loud jokes. One especially good one is near the end so hang around even if your not enjoying it. I can only recommend this film to anyone looking for good solid entertainment and a film that takes itself lightly.",Jason X

First i heard it was freddy vs. jason, then finally i heard it was just another sequel. Well lo and behold, this movie screams of low-budget cheese factory. It was horrendously bad. The story is so awful, its hilarious. Its basically this-having finally caught and imprisoned jason, a female scientist tries to find ways to execute him(she says theyve tried everything from gas chamber to firing squad and he won't die)and finally gives up, so instead they will cryogenically freeze him forever. Then one of the head scientists decide they will keep him alive so they can study him. He laughably explains that jason has an amazing ability to heal, hence the difficulty of people trying to kill him. Anyway, he escapes being fully chained, then gets frozen, then defrosts and lives again only to keep killing everyone on sight for no reason. An absolute must see.",Jason X

406,SMLA13,"Not bad, yet not good",7,11 May 2002,"Jason X isn't a very bad sequel to the normal Friday the 13th sequels. Jason X takes place in 2455, earth is ruined and a group of archaelogist students, along with some soldiers and a teacher, take a trip to the ruined earth.  That's when they come across two frozen bodies. One, a VERY hot girl. The other, some freaky guy wearing a hockey mask and wielding a machete.  That's when the plot holes start to kick in. the first one, it is not very smart to thaw out a tall freak who is wearing a hockey mask and has a machete in his hand.  Now what kind of idiots thaw out a person like that? Our doomed students are.  So they unthaw the two bodies out and the first one is the hot girl.  She tells them not to unthaw the other one because it is the infamous Jason Voorhees.  But they're a little too late for that. Jason is already on the loose and might I add is VERY p**sed off.  Then comes the screaming and running and dying.Most of the characters in this flick are pretty cool, like the sexually curious android and the tough Sergeant who just won't die.  The fights between Jason and Kay-Em 14(the android) is very entertaining, along with the fight between Jason and Sergeant Broadski.  Most of this movie isn't as bad as critics say.  Jason gets to revisit Camp Crystal Lake circa 1980. He gets to entertain two pre-marital loving campers, and even redoes a classic death in Friday the 13th part 7 (I won't give it away.)  Overall this movie is good yet can live without the plot holes (So they just remember at the end they have an escape pod.) Rating 6 out of 10.",Jason X
407,snuggleskunk,A whole load of friday fun,8,23 August 2002,"Not many films can make it to there tenth outing and do it with this much style. Jason X is of course the big nineties (or should I say noughties?) remake of the series but its done with such loving care and such a good sense of humour that anyone who enjoys good silly horror fun will love it. It's not terrifying but it has great jump shocks, imaginative deaths (minor spoiler) especially the frozen head one, and great little jokes.  The film starts a few years from now in Camp Crystal Lake Research centre where Jason is being held.  Unable to execute him this is where Jason has ended up but then of course some government people who think they can contain Jason turn up, ignore the cute scientist warning and do what they want. Anyhoo without spoiling it too much Jason and the women scientist end up cryogenically frozen and are then found by a group of teenagers on an expidition led by their professor a few hundred years later.  The idea of putting Jason in space may sound silly but it is thoroughly enjoyable.  This film is cool. Trust me.",Jason X

Highlights: few Really cool kill scenes... couple laughs.

Don't bring your brains 'cause you won't be needing them. I only had seen the first of the Friday the 13th movies, a movie that I liked a lot, the 80s were the best decade for slasher movies.As a slasher movie, the way it was intended to be, Jason X totally sucks, but actually this movie was so bad, that I liked it. The one-liners are very silly and unfunny, but in a way that they become funny again like for example SPOILER when Jason throws one of the soldiers on a screw, another soldiers reports that his friend is screwed END SPOILER.Of course this isn't oscar material, but if you look at it as a comedy, you might find it entertaining.",Jason X
410,Jason_LR,stupidest idea ever,1,12 July 2009,"I can't believe that some people actually enjoyed this movie, I mean, it's the biggest load of crap I have ever seen in my entire life, and I have seen my share of horrible horror movies.When I first watched ""Jason goes to hell"", I thought to myself: if I ignore that it's part of the Friday the 13th saga, this movie isn't so bad, it's stupid yes, but it can kind of be entertaining.Now, as far as Jason X is concerned, you can pretend that it's a completely new idea, with a completely new serial killer and it still it's preposterous.The simple notion of having Jason go to space is ridiculous, I mean really, how many of us think of the space as scary? Granted, alien was an awesome movie, but it was a horror movie with a creature FROM space, not a serial killer that hides in the woods and used to chop off teenagers that smoked pot and had 'round the clock sex (good old times, sigh) that's suddenly shipped off to space.As for the contents of the movie, the acting is totally lame, (it kind of looks like some bad TV movie acting), the sets are incredibly badly built, and what the hell was that? Uber Jason? When I saw that I couldn't believe my eyes..Jason is freakin' terminator now? Fighting a robot chick (or whatever)? The doctor who got frozen with him was the worst female lead in a horror movie of all time, the rest of the remaining characters, god, i just wanted to dress myself as Jason and kill them all myself. they were so annoying, you just want to watch them die. And if the whole freaking world knows how dangerous Jason Vorhees is, WHY IN HELL WOULD SOMEOME WANT TO KEEP HIM ALIVE? Because he's a god damned zombie? Come on, get real..This movie just seems to be a stern of ludicrous ideas and an attempt to revitalize the Friday the 13th saga, which, imo, killed it instead. I am a huge Friday the 13th fan, but this movie is really horrible.I don't advise anyone to waste their time in this piece of crap, unless you want to rip out your eyeballs so you don't have to watch (which I almost did).Seriously, don't waste your time with this one, just not worth it, at all.",Jason X
411,marsznklin,"Dumb, unoriginal and extremely overrated",1,17 June 2015,"Even worse than JGTH to be honest. The acting is at an all time low, as is the dialogue, cinematography, story, music,everything. Uber Jason? Ugh. The attempts at comedy were juvenile and forced. Over the years I've tried so hard to give this film some type of credit, but it's just absolutely awful. The best thing about this film is the liquid nitrogen kill, but that's it. Uber Jason was a stupid idea...these types of ideas are what kills franchises.It just pisses me off. To me, this movie was even worse than Jason Goes To Hell. The death scenes were terrible except for those two that I mentioned earlier. The kill number of this movie is 24, but 2 are accidents and 2 are suicide type things so really, Jason only killed 20. So it's a relatively higher number than any of the other movies except for Freddy Vs.

To my mind, Mika Ward has the most beautiful woman's back in the whole movie history. She's SO sexy even when shot in a dark environment and only from the back. Really! Good acting (how does she move!! wow!!) and camera work here, pretty good. But that's the only good thing about this movie.

I feel sorry for the actors, I understand that actors need to get their foot in the door somewhere even if the movie is this horrible. Whats the plot of this movie? Whatever it is, its not a very good one. I don't like Jason part 1 through 9, I don't think they are scary, just very loud and gory, but at least they are movies and somewhat tolerable. I don't understand what these random killings and hormone driven teens are doing. Why are teens a spaceship? Why does he kill everyone and why doesn't he just kill everybody already? Must he torture us with horrible movies while doing so? What is his purpose? What will he do after everyone is dead? Sit around? Why can't people kill him? When some one shoots him he just keeps coming, its gotten old and predictable. Why even fight? You know whoever fights him is gonna die. They can at least humor me and if thats the case, why even make a movie? The answer to that is money and the existence of this movie can only be explained and justified by Hollywood trying to milk another penny out of a series of movies that for one, I never liked, and two, is growing very old at a very fast rate Horrible.",Jason X

I don't know if the filmmakers were shooting for it, but they achieved a level of shlockiness that just.... works. Is it a stupid premise? Yes. Is it ridiculously predictable? You bet your a**. But be honest, none of us watched this for high drama or Hollywood gold, because we knew it wasn't going to be here. This franchise became a cliche over a decade ago, and this film is pure, distilled cliche. Knowing that going in let's you just enjoy a film that doesn't take itself, or the genre, too seriously. I'd bet real money that 95% of the people who watched this at least giggled at, ""It'll take more than that to put this old dog down; yup, that oughta do it.""

418,MyersH78,Jason at his best,9,21 August 2001,"I felt really lucky to be able to see JASON X in Stuttgart on the closing night of the Fantasy Filmfest. It was my first chance to see a Jason film on the big screen as the series went direct to video in Germany a long time ago. So standing in line for a sold-out showing of a Jason sequel in Germany used to be quite impossible to imagine.I should add that I'm a big fan of 80s slashers and the FRIDAY THE 13TH-series. My favourite Jason films so far were PART 2 as it's the scariest and Part 6: JASON LIVES that started to celebrate Jason as the unrivalled hero of the series. I had high expectations for JASON X but it still had to live up to an entire series of films I really enjoy.I can tell you it did. First of all the special effects looked really good. This isn't THE MATRIX but considering the quite low budget the space sequences looked fine. Of course, space is not what the film's about. Unsurprisingly, I was pretty sceptical when I first heard about the space setting. But this film is still about Jason and the makers aren't afraid to admit it. It really shows that both director James Isaac and screenwriter Todd Farmer are fans of the series. While Michael Myers didn't play enough of a role in HALLOWEEN: H20 for my taste, Jason is at the centre of this one. And there's no tendency to make him less evil or violent, either. There is some humour in JASON X, but that has always been part of the series. This isn't a self-ironic sell-out to audiences that are used to bad and boring films like VALENTINE and URBAN LEGENDS being called horror. JASON X is basically an 80s slasher flick with a higher budget. So if someone has a problem with the concept of a superhuman, unstoppable killing machine being the hero of a franchise, JASON X probably won't win them over. But if you like slasher flicks and therefore don't expect this to win Academy Awards I can hardly imagine anyone being disappointed. You've got your masked psychopath, a supply of pointy objects, gory and surprisingly creative kills (in particular Jason's first one aboard the space ship) and of course lots of potential victims that have no idea what they're up against. On the other hand there could have been more suspense. In that respect JASON X is similar to JASON LIVES which is fun and spectacular but doesn't really try to scare the audience too much.While two thirds of the film are good without necessarily presenting anything new, the last half hour actually has a few unexpected surprises including one of the most nostalgic and funny sequences in horror film history. I don't want to give it away but once the score from Part 1 starts playing and Jason finds himself in a familiar place fans of the series are in for a real treat. I also liked the ending very much that once again pays tribute to the series. I definitely left with a smile on my face.In conclusion I can say JASON X is the best new slasher / horror film I have seen in a long time. It has some modern elements, but it stays true to the series. I definitely recommend it!",Jason X
419,quidstate,The first horror sequel in space to pull it off.,8,20 March 2002,"I expected worse considering the sorry state of horror sequels lately and the idea to put Jason in space but this movie was done well. It makes good use of gore without becoming a complete splatter-fest (I know, that would have been nice). The space scenario wasn't abused, they didn't have all sorts of high-tech gadgetry to use against Jason and when they did pull out some futuristic stuff, Jason just hacked his way through it. Almost all the people on the ""transporter"" were late teens/early 20s and, of course, the girls are hot. You get the prerequisite breast shots and pre-marital sex to raise Jason's ire. Also, there is some good intentional humor, essential in cheap horror movies. There is a bit of cheesiness present but not much and the movie keeps good pace and is entertaining.",Jason X
420,alwayz_blu,Jason X had me looking over my shoulders,9,1 November 2005,"Okay a lot of people I know is giving Jason X pretty bad reviews. People has told me time and time again that Jason X wasn't a good horror movie. To me, it was one of the best. All the other Jason movies had me laughing at others who seemed to be bothered and scared by Jason. This Jason movie, Had me scared. The first death scene was pretty gruesome and the way that those poor people were STUCK on a spacecraft with virtually nowhere to run to made it more scary to me. There are similarities in characters from this movie to the others..The lines that they say...like, ""he is dead!"", ""we are safe now!"" those lines we have heard over and over on all of the Jason films.

Thankfully it doesn't dissapoint and overall is a pretty good slasher movie (which may not be saying a lot for some, but you've got to judge it based on what it is). Jason does the same thing he did in the previous Friday movies, just this time he does it in space.  Acting is fine for this type of movie, which again, isn't saying much, but they hold their own.  The story isn't exactly the most well developed, and it doesn't quite pick up where Part 9 left off. I guess Jason got lost in route to hell. Anyways, the movie is good, Uber Jason is pretty cool, but Im not sure if he could be sustained for a whole movie, but if Jason X makes any money at all at the box office, I'm sure we'll find out (and maybe even if it flops).",Jason X
422,josh020615,Pure utter cheese that is so bad its not even good,1,9 May 2002,"Jason X is complete utter garbage that tries so hard to pull itself off as a high budget sci-fi flick.  It basically looks like a Fullmoon direct-to-video flick, but with a higher budget than any fullmoon film. The basic plot is that Jason is frozen at Camp Crystal Lake facility in the year 2004 (I think) or 2007 and then 4.55 hundred years later he is thawed out and brought back to life by a scientist and his college students.  And get this, it takes place in space. Ok, you already knew that and so didn't I going into the movie. Hell I should have used common sense to steer clear of this, but I wanted to see a cheesy movie and Jason X oozed with it. I went and was expecting what I saw in the trailer, a roller coaster, horror cheese fest. Was I wrong though about it being somewhat decent. There is no suspense or thrills, like in the other Friday the 13ths, in this flick and the dialogue is dry and utter nonsense.  ""Its ok guys he just wanted his machete back."" UGH!!!  Or how about the line when one the guy (don't remember his name or any of the characters because they weren't important except Jason) is thrown on a giant screw. One of the soldiers finds him dead and get this when the captain asks the man's status the stupid bitch replies, ""he is screwed."" Oh dear.  Every hallway in the god damn ship has no lights. They have the technology to bring people back to life, but they don't have the intelligence to put lights in a space ship. I expected gore and rather twisted, but cool death scenes and I was disappointed once again except for one death. Just one and it was when Jason froze the hot blonde's head and then shattered it to pieces against the counter. Poor thing. Why do the hot ones always die in the beginning? Even the cutest guy was butchered 10 mins later. Dammit. At least both of them had small parts and won't be remembered being in this crap pile.  Anyways, the only good scenes were Jason's upgrade and the virtual reality camp Crystal Lake.  Oh god that was funny and possibly the best, demented sick humor I have seen in a while, those poor female campers. HEHE!!! Although, it has some good scenes the rest of movie is just plain horrible cheese that is so bad that it's not even good.

423,milath,By far the best Friday the 13th...,5,2 April 2002,"Well boys and girls, it's that time again. Time for another Jason/Friday the 13th movie. Being an Gen X'er who grew up with these movies, I have to say, when one thinks about it, this is quite an accomplishment for ANY movie franchise. I mean, how many movies make it to a -10th-, outside of the porn industry, that is? Sure, it may not be academy award winning stuff, but it's fun popcorn entertainment nonetheless. In this particular sequel, the series finally takes the well-advised turn into sci-fi-horror-humor. There are some sincerely funny, dry-wit one liners in this movie. And of course we have Jason, who, like that battery bunny just keeps going and going and going... The movie finally changes the general scenery from the other films and jumps 450 years into the future, which may not make much sense until you actually watch it, but it does make for an interesting twist in the series. Of course, as with all the previous Friday's, there are an abundance of wildly creative death sequences, a bevy of beautiful, unheard of, actors and actresses, all of whom are fodder for Jason (Kane Hodder). But then, let's be honest, if you're watching this movie, would you be expecting anything less? Rooting for Jason to kill the beautiful people is what drives the series, in my humble opinion, and there is plenty of rooting to be done in this one. Near the end of the film we get to see Uber-Jason. Futuristically reconstructed and even more unstoppable, if that was even possible. On top of all that, we even get a hilarious throwback to the very first Friday the 13th (think sleeping bags). In the end, this movie is just plain fun and well worth a trip to the theater. But if you miss it, don't worry..  the movie clearly sets up a possibility of Friday the 13th Part 11. >",Jason X

Jason movie if this film bombs at the box office.  I'm sure everyone can spare 2 hours of their precious time and 10.00 bucks to go see this.  I hate the whole space thing also; however, I will atleast give it a try.  If you can, wait a week or two after opening weekend; thus, horror movies do well opening weekenend then drop.  Look how well Scream did at the box office and how they soaked that franchise for everything.  I'd much rather have Jason soak up the money instead.",Jason X
426,tdb41,The best worst movie I have ever seen.,8,26 April 2002,"I really enjoyed the old Friday the 13th movies, so when I first saw a commercial advertising Jason X, I knew I had to go see this one even though the movie looked horrible (haha).  This movie was unbelievably corny and silly.  At least some of the original movies in the series were somewhat believable, but Jason X was so different and intentionally humorous that I'm sure a lot of people think the movie has destroyed the franchise which became one of the cornerstones of horror.If you haven't seen this movie, but have seen some of the first ones, imagine this: Jason Vorhees set loose inside a space ship much like the Starship Enterprise on Star Trek: The Next Generation (complete with Holodecks, I'm serious).  Yeah, Jason basically walks around this spaceship with his machete and kills everybody one by one.  It's so stupid that it's funny.  The story is absolutely horrible especially with the way the movie cuts from one scene to another.I thought the funniest part of the movie was*** SPOILER AHEAD ***close to the end when the original space ship blew up, yet Jason was flying in outer space towards the ship.  That was so silly -- probably the silliest thing I have ever seen in a horror movie, or any movie for that matter.If you're a fan of the series or the horror genre, obviously you'll want to see it.  If you're looking for a quick fix / good laugh, this is also a good movie for it.  I mean, you basically have to go into this movie already expecting it to be a little random and outrageous, cause that's exactly what it is.  I'd recommend most people to wait for it to hit the $1.50 theaters or even the local video store.",Jason X
427,lo0obrandono0ol,A good addition to the series,10,27 May 2002,"When this came out on April 26th, I figured I would have a few weeks to see it. I couldn't have been more wrong. It was out two weeks and then it was replaced by other movies coming out, before I could even see it. Fortunately, I found a bootleg of it online. Now, I'm not sure if the bootleg is a rough cut of the film or what, since I never saw it in theaters. I have to say that it was good. It was a nice change from the usual theme of Jason running around campgroundish places and killing people. Some of the death scenes were very creative (Adrienne, Kicker, and Janessa, to name a couple). The acting wasn't too terrific. Lexa Doig and Lisa Ryder were allright. I read a rough draft of the script online that had Kay-Em 14 as very perverted and humerous. I have to say I was disappointed at the lack of this in the film. Melyssa Ade truly shined here. She has some great acting skills (and her cleavage wasn't too bad either). Melody Johnson (Kinsa) came off as very annoying, and I think it took her too long to die. At first, I was a little sketchy about the space stuff, but when it comes down to it, this is still Jason at his best. Definitely not oscar material (and why should it be?) but it is a nice addition to the series. Certainly better than Jason Goes to Hell. Hopefully they'll be an uncut or unrated edition on DVD...go see it if you haven't! Any Friday fans should appreciate this.",Jason X
428,PARA2K,"High frag-rate, low budget, no sense.... (minor spoilers ahead)",1,27 November 2002,"I was just in the mood and watched Halloween Resurrection and Jason X after another. Now i can hardly tell, which one was worse, i tend to this one. Well, i use to switch off my brain while watching Horror-Movies as it can't stand most of em for long and would gain a serious damage. Well, watching Jason X even the primary brain functions to perform life support are enough to see through this very thin story as it lacks of any surprises. To say the truth: The story is almost absent and can be told with just 11 words: Frozen Jason gets reactivated in future and kills people on starship. Ok, if it is well done, even that can be enough. In this case it is not. Seems like the director/writers of this movies just had played too much Unreal Tournament, at least Jasons Frag-Rate is the nearly the same and in the end he even gets a nice armour (well, as a player model it would look good in UT, indeed...). Sometimes they tried to make it a bit funny like scream but failed. So all what is left is  Jason killing people and even that gets boring after a while. For some decent Special FX and the nice Design of Jasons Armour it gets 2 points. For dumb characters in the movie that are -as usual in that genre- too dumb to stick together in a room and concentrate their firepower it gets one removed. Makes 1 point. If it helps to prevent part no. 11 i will give more, promised.PARA2K",Jason X

I have heard lots of critics that HAVEN'T EVEN WATCHED THE MOVIE bash the film, I will have to admit, I don't see why New Line would have Jason go to hell one installment and never explain how Jason comes back the next.Jason X is funny, exciting, and action-packed; however, it is NOT intended to be scary, but any fan of Jason knows this.  Friday the 13th and Jason films were never intended to be scary, but they were intended to be what it has been doing for 22 years, a good summer slasher film.I do have to question the Jason franchise, you have said that he died twice, but it seems that he just comes back.  I know in the sixth installment we find out how he does come back, but in Jason X, we never know how he comes back, he just comes back.  Funny how the devil doesn't want Jason around.If you're a fan of slasher films, you'll love it; if you're a Jason fan, you'll REALLY love it, if you're looking for a good film to spend some money on, you MAY like it, but one thing is for sure, you will walk out of the theater saying one word.

So it was either 'Jason X' or nothing. So since I was already at the theater I bought some tickets. This awful movie should be scary, but it's funnier than it is scary. I gave this movie a 1.

I gives you lots of action with lots of gore, which you've grown to expect from these movies. I saw every single friday movie at least once  and from the jason series I think I liked this one best. Again....this kind of movie in only enjoyable if you like the genre, plain and simple. Don't watch it with your friends, because they won't appreciate this side of the horror scene, as they have become used to 'good story and creepy effects' movies like what lies beneath and the others.",Jason X
434,ViolatedDevotion,Actually good,10,27 January 2002,"I remember a while ago thinking how terrible this is that Jason is going to space . . . Well, although I would loved for Jason to stay on earth and be HIM for the rest of the movie . . . this is a welcome change from one of the worst movie I have seen and not just from Friday the 13th it was horrible. Jason actually looks decent in the film until he becomes ""Uber-Jason"" and although he looks funny in pictures it's a little easier to stomach in the movie it self.  The score is great and it's very nice to have Harry back this time around even though there are some cheesy parts in the score. The story is good and easy to follow with some great characters and good dialogue and the acting is above average for this type of movie and it's so good not to see one of the people from Dawsons creek up there with Mr.Voorhess.  Although the story is a tad out there the beginning made it a little more believable as hard as that is to say and it doesn't get to farfetched with it being in the future. All in all I was surprised and welcome this into the series!",Jason X

Brought to their spacecraft and revived through nanotechnology, he promptly starts his famous walking-around-and-slashing-people. There are absolutely no surprises for even the dumbest horror-film-buff. Sorry, folks, but not even an nice try.The following maybe a Spoiler to some.Matrix-style fight scenes in which an latex-clad female android fires Woo-like her two guns at the foe.

If you liked the other friday the 13th movies, this one will not disappoint you, sometimes you need a not so serious horror movie, this one delivers what is expected of it.

Don't get me wrong, I'm a HUGE fan of the ""Friday the 13th"" Series (well, I THOUGHT it was called ""Friday the 13th""....what the hell is ""JASON X""?).  Even though this is the 10th installment (I guess that explains the ""X"" in ""JASON X"") of what I thought was a series, taking into account that this movie has absolutely NOTHING to do with any of the other ""Friday the 13th"" movies, this film just doesn't cut it.  There's not enough gore like usual, the killings suck (c'mon, why the hell would the camera cut away when someone's about to get slaughtered by the hands of Jason Vorhees!), not enough nudity, and worst of all...we get the treat of seeing ""horror get an UPGRADE"" - a cyborg Jason Vorhees.  What the hell is that all about!?  The fact that this whole movie takes place in space on a damn wannabe Star Trek shuttle is no picnic either.  The only thing even remotely decent about this film was the Suburban Commando (hahaha) who wasn't afraid of Jason, as well as getting to stare at Lexa Doig for an hour and a half.  Other than that, if you're a true Jason fan, then you'll understand my disgust and pure disappointment for this piece of trash, and you'll do what's best and forget that ""JASON X"" was even made.  To all of you lame Hollywood producers and scriptwriters, I think Beavis & Butt-Head said it best, ""PLEASE STOP IN THE NAME OF ALL THAT WHICH DOES NOT SUCK!""",Jason X

If you're a Friday the 13th Fan (and let's face it: who isn't? ahem...) you'll love this one. Don't listen to all those whiny film students (or film students-to-be) complaining about bad dialogue and cardboard characters. Those of us in the know realize it's easier (and a lot more fun) to see people you don't care about get stalked and skewered than it would be if you liked 'em too much.Most annoying character?

440,IKP280,Jason X won't win an Oscar but its definitely entertaining,9,28 April 2002,"I'm a big fan of all horror movies out there and specifically the Friday the 13th Series.  And Jason X is a great addition to the series; it is over the top and comical at times but what else can you expect for the tenth movie in a series.  Many people are bashing the movie and ripping it apart anyway they can.  Last time I checked a movie doesn't have to be the work of some frustrated artist trying to point out he flaws in our society or some other piece of trash preaching to me about what the artist feels is important to be entertaining.  If you are going to watch a Jason movie or any slasher flick then you should expect to see lots of killing and at times something comical thrown in.  If your going to see a story that says something like the Matrix or Requiem for a Dream then a slasher movie is not for you. Jason X delivers in all the ways that it should and like it should doesn't take itself too seriously and ruin the story by trying to make a Jason movie more than an unstoppable killing machine taking care of business with horny teenagers.  I highly suggest anyone who likes 80's slasher movies to go see this movie, you will not be dissappointed.  If your the type of person that orders a triple latte then maybe you should skip on this film and go rent a Disney movie.",Jason X
441,Knarferr,Know what you are getting into and you will love this film.,10,29 April 2002,"Let's be real, this is part 10 of what is one of the worst movie franchises in film history. It's not Chariots of Fire, it's Jason Ten. If you not only accept that, but embrace the shear ridiculousness of it, this is one incredibly entertaining movie. The filmmakers obviously didn't take themselves or their content too seriously and the film is tremendously tongue in cheek. Don't expect anything scary, but get ready to laugh. I totally enjoyed the movie, as did everyone else in the theater. If you go into with the right attitude, it's impossible not to like this movie.",Jason X

This movie rocks, not only as a well-made Jason movie but overall as a decent sci-fi slaughterfest! Slaughterfest it is, as it contains the most kills per movie than any of the previous films of the series. Being in outerspace also gives much more creativity to some of the deaths. It was cool to hear the audience cheer at the first deaths rooting for Jason, and the crowd laughing their butts off at some of the humorous bits in the film. Don't worry about not seeing the previous films before this one. If you know who Jason is, you will enjoy this film. Don't expect academy award quality. You won't find it. This movie is just pure fun from beginning to end.",Jason X

Geesh is America that hard up for entertainment! I think the writers of be Kind rewind has a greater chance of winning and Oscar, Academy award, and I would even throw in Grammy just to prove how awful this movie was.

Granted it takes place in space but it was still pretty excellent for a B horror film. I mean did you see ""Jason Goes To Hell"" thats all i have to say. Kane Hodder comes back to play Jason Voorheis again and did a very good job. Lexa Doig who played Rowan was hot and played the authority female very well. Lisa Ryder as Kay-Em 14 Her scenes were hilarious.I just thought that this was a very great film and i reecommend it too anyone who enjoys horror films. Todd Farmer who worte this did a very good job. Especially after that disater of a film ""Jason Goes To Hell"". The actors were great, the movie had suspense , GORE, and comedy- Especially the scene with Jonathon Potts and Melyssa Ade, you all know what i'm talking about, that was hilarious. Let's just hope that if they do make another Friday 13th film hopefully it will be good as this one and that they bring Kane Hodder back as Jason Voorheis",Jason X

446,nst031,Jason in Space: how is that not funny?,8,25 October 2008,"What most people don't seem to understand about Jason X is the fact that it is obviously a comedy. Really. Just watch it thinking that it is a spoof of Alien Resurrection and you can truly appreciate the movie. Don't try to take it seriously, because if you do, you will hate the movie, as well as miss the point. I mean, come on. It's a Jason movie in space. How can you possibly take that seriously? Honestly, no one should do that with Jason movies anyway, excluding the first one, which wasn't even truly a Jason movie. Do i need to remind you about the wheelchair death in Friday the 13th part 2? Or how about the death by weed-eater in part 7? Let's also not forget Jason takes Manhattan, which was hilarious. So, in essence, if you watch Jason X expecting to be scared or expecting a riveting plot line , you are watching the wrong movie. Go watch Halloween or the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre. On the other hand, if you want to laugh and still get to see gratuitous violence, then by all means, watch Jason X. It has all of the staples of the series and some fairly creative kills along with parts that are so ridiculous you can't help but laugh, such as the hologram sequences and uber-Jason. Overall, i think Jason X is highly underrated mostly because so many people don't have a sense of humor. The writers are obviously able to laugh at themselves, so you should be able to as well.",Jason X
447,02001525,Just a bit too far!,3,8 November 2002,"Jason X - Review.'Evil Gets an Upgrade', describes the way Jason goes from being a supernatural killer, with a large knife walking through the forest, looking for revenge and not really knowing where he is going.Now Jason has a new look, 'a mean, lean fighting machine', dressed like a new version of Terminator. The outcome unfortunately, is a slightly funny, unrealistic, version of some of the classics, like Halloween and the first Friday 13th. Back then people wanted to see blood, guts and plenty of stalk 'n' slash, now all we get is people coming out with some of the worst lines ever, while they are face to face with the killer. People still want to be put into suspense and this film's only positive side is that it does add a few twists towards the end.Jason can never be killed, why Jason's victims don't start to do what they are supposed to do and get running, instead of standing in their in the face of death with not a chance in the world, is beyond knowledge, this will almost certainly add more scares and humour all on its own.Overall Rating: 3/10",Jason X
448,bunnyhugs,Jason x stinks!,4,18 June 2009,I give it a 4 only because of one person in the film that did a decent job & that man's name is Kane Hodder. It's a pity this has been the last time he played Jason cause he does an exceptional job. I hope Hollywood casting directors don't blame him for the piece of crap.It was all the other actors that were god awful. It was poorly written. Not an ounce of creativety other than that woman that gets frozen & smashed into pieces. That was the most entertaining death you will see.I was quite bored by watching this except for the scenes with Hodder in it. I would rate this better than Jason goes to hell as there's more Hodder/Jason scenes though jgth was far more scarier & interesting.,Jason X

450,malachiX2000,Why do people watch crap like this?,1,22 August 2006,"This came on TV a few nights ago and, not surprisingly, was painfully bad on just about every level. What bugs me is that they keep making crap like this because people keep watching it. I read some review on Rotten Tomatoes in which the critic, probably some guy living in his parent's basement, argued that critics would pan this film just because it's a slasher film. I think it's quite the opposite. I think slasher fans will love any piece of crap no matter how terrible it is. There are well made Slasher films. The original Friday The Thirteenth, the original Halloween, the original Nightmare on Elmstree, Scream, and many more. These weren't masterpieces of American cinema but they at least managed to be creepy and entertaining. Not the case with this. It's terribly shot, terribly acted, and, worst of all, not the least bit scary. There's never any tension in the film. Most of the deaths are quick and silly with little to no suspense or build up. Any build up that is there simply amounts to us looking at Jason standing stationary as he waits to kill someone. Why is it that horror fans can't distiguish a good slasher film from a bad one? Why do they let studios get away with crap like this? And I grow tired of the ""it's tongue-in-cheek"" defense. Pulling off tongue-in-cheek requires writing that's witty and amusing. Not hoping that because you're dialogue, acting, and directing is so bad that people will laugh awkwardly.

I have seen this movie twice and I think that it is better then most of the Friday films but still, it wasn't the best of them though.But, Jason in space was better then most ideas. I thought this movie was better than parts 5,7, and 9. The kills are pretty cool and it has a good body count. The only thing that I hate about this movie that the acting is TERRIBLE. People start to die like every 2 minutes and that most of the characters are annoying and make dumb jokes. This is probably the least scary of the series but it is very very entertaining, and I still recommend watching this if your a Jason fan. I give this film a 6 out of 10 (Good)",Jason X

455,AmericanDreamz,Wow,2,16 July 2006,"Well, my brother told me to watch this so I did. What a waste of money they spent. They could have had much better death scenes. Only one death was half-way futuristic. The movie is supposed to be in the future so people can die in cool ways, but no. Basically the deaths contained of him stabbing people and cracking peoples bones. How boring/lame. I wanted to see more blood and more gore, and more original ways to die. They could of easily had an awesome beam death, and an awesome futuristic weapon kill. I felt ashamed of renting the movie when it was over, and even more ashamed when I found out it was late. Wow. I do not recommend this movie. Go and rent the third Jason. It's possibly the best Jason movie yet. Jason VS. Freddy is okay, but the original Jason's rock. How about Jason X2 with futuristic deaths? Hopefully they can get smart and know how to create those kind of deaths, since it's supposed to be THE FUTURE. Oh well, 2 out of 10.

As always, they think of many new ways to butcher anything that moves, and the movie is seriously hilarious (like I said, if you like Friday movies) and yes, it is intentional.  If you want to see a good scary movie, what the hell are you watching Friday the 13th Part 10 for?  It's just a bunch of moronic fun, don't look for anything past that.

457,SNORKY-2,Jason in Space... Could have been great.,8,29 April 2002,"Jason X is a letdown, no doubt about it.  The trailer for the film looked like it would contain some campy fun, but only about the quarter of the movie really lives up to my expectations.  Maybe that is the problem I went into a 'Friday the 13th' film with expectations.The problem suffers the same fate as many horror franchises, lack of creativity.  Just seeing Jason Vorhees on screen is not enough reason to make a sequel.  Give the guy something new to do.  In this film they move Jason to a whole new setting, outer space in the future full of so many options to play with including technology, gravity, cool weapons, etc. but never take advantage of them.  Three quarters of the film could basically be from any of the previous nine films, except this one takes place on a spaceship.  I was hoping that the series would take some serious chances and almost reinvent itself like the campy horror film ""Bride of Chucky"" did. 'Chucky' was joy to sit through.  Sure it's not 'Casablanca', but I was entertained by the fact that I wasn't pedaled the same film as the previous three.  It strayed from the previous three films seriousness and tried some funny scenarios that were more tongue in cheek than I could have expected. 'Chucky' was a success and may have saved the dying series.
I can't say that about the 'Jason X'.  The film was given the chance and may have blown it.  People don't go to see the old horror franchises to be scared anymore.  Jason, Freddie, and Michael Meyers have become the heroes not the villains.  The directors have to start focusing more on giving the ""villains"" the right attitudes and unique scenarios than trying to make them creepy.  We all know Jason kills, now we want to see what happens when Jason tries to kill in zero gravity.  I thought the producers were going to try some new things with the Jason character in 'Jason Takes Manhattan'.  In the end that film turned out being just another 'F/t13th' film.  In both films 'Jason X' and 'J-Takes-Manhattan' they should have added fish out of water scenarios than looking for scares that never really add up to much.  'Jason X' could have been a hit if people were given something to leave the theatres and talk about.  All horror movie killings are the same.  Fifteen years ago they were a topic for discussion, now we want more than that.  As I said there are some redeeming scenes later in the film, that hit the exact note I was expecting to find throughout the film.  I won't reveal anything, because only if you pay to see this film do you deserve to know.I am sure when you leave the theatre (if anyone else goes to see this) thinking, why didn't they do more fun stuff like in the last 30 minutes? Maybe there were two different directors.  If I had a time machine I would go back ten years and find the guy who wrote 'JX' and put him on the right track.",Jason X
458,dvdtaz,A great fun ride,9,9 August 2001,"I just saw this flick at the Fantasy Filmfestival in Cologne. To be honest, I never was the ultimate Friday the 13th fan, so I had really low expectations when going into the theater. As a matter of fact, I just saw the first 4 parts and think they are so-so. Jason X has not been rated (for Germany and for the US), so we saw the full uncut version in all its glory.As I said before, I had no expectations in this film. It took me completely by surprise, when I saw this great roller coaster ride full of fun and gore. Jason X doesn't take itself seriously and plays with the typical elements - just like ""Bride of Chucky"". There are plenty of gore scenes, which are very well done. The story... Well, do you really expect a story or characters? Jason X has only one priority: FUN.I have the feeling, that Jason X is made for the fans. Gore, twisted humor, nice ideas, typical elements (even Crystal Lake apears) and many little things only fans will notice. Everything they expected, they get here.I had a great time watching Jason X. Like it or be screwed...",Jason X
459,unisol26,Welcome return of the 1980's most infamous horror icon.,10,28 April 2002,"""Jason X"" is an excellent film. Simply put. The C.G.I. effects are superb and very believable. The actor's do try hard and it shows, they exchange witty comments while expressing actual fear at the same time. Kane Hodder does a great job reprising Jason Voorhees, he never says anything but he still can maintain that ""Jason"" feeling just by his body movements, and think that is partially the reason why this film works. I thought the idea of putting Jason in space was comical, but I wasn't so quick to disregard it because of a new setting, which many narrow-minded people have done. Jason is still himself, he just has new victims, new settings, and more advanced weapons they can fight him with. But not-surprisingly this film is absolutely flawless. There is a new element added to the series: Humor. The cast makes many one-liners and the scene in which (SPOILER) Uber Jason beats one promiscuous teen with another promiscuous teen is just flat out hilarious, it's one of those ""You have to see it"" moments. This is probably the most original Friday sequel, and many will say that this film does rip off Alien, but I don't think they are ripping off Alien, I feel that they were paying homage to a classic film. Overall ""Jason X"" is an excellent return to the big-screen for Jason, and credit is due to the cast and crew for creating an original Friday the 13th instead of staying in the woods. Kudos to New Line for going out on a limb with this film, I and many appreciate it. Hopefully this film will get ""Freddy VS Jason"" greenlight and lead to another Friday the 13th.",Jason X

Most people talk about how horror movies aren't scary or how slasher flicks are all the same and many won't see this movie because they are ""above"" this kind of filmIf you go into the movie with the understanding that this movie is made for fans of the franchise and many of the laughs are there to be enjoyed, you will like this film.  It is one of the funniest movies I have seen in a while.Now, you may think that it is not meant to be funny and I am laughing at the film, but that is simply not the case.  I am laughing at the jokes and gags that were placed in the film by filmmakers that were probably laughing harder than I was when I watched it.Don't go in thinking this is a serious horror film, because it is not meant to be taken seriously.  It has its moments of scary parts and it has its moments of gore, but the basis of the film is that it is a fun film and should be watched as a simple, enjoyable good time.  On that level it succeeds very well.",Jason X

463,pvanravenstein,one of the worst movies in history,1,12 May 2008,"This movie was so bad I was compelled to go online and write about it.reasons why this is one of the worst movies ever:1. EVERYBODY in this movie is stupid. eg. doctor just before Jason kills him: ""See guys? Jason just wanted his machete back!"" 2. The dialog is really, really bad. eg. ""Why don't you stick your head out the door and see if Jason's gone?"" 3. The weapons in this movie are very disappointing. You'd think in the far future they'd have better weapons than guns that shoot bullets. 4. The story sucks. I think they were trying to marry Friday the thirteenth with the Aliens franchise. 5. There's a lot of stuff in the movie that doesn't make sense, like: i) why didn't the guy who got impaled through the chest twice die? I know they had nanotechnology to revive him, but it took them so long to get to him, he would've been dead. ii) how did Jason's mask stay on this face throughout the movie after the doctor cut it off? iii) why did they save the really good weapons til the end? iv) why did they leave Jason just sitting in the nanotech machine, knowing it might come alive and revive him? v) why wasn't Jason blown into outer space with the rest of the ship that got blown off? 6. The ending is just so incredibly dumb when the guy flies in with the jet pack and scoops Jason away 7. Why are there 3 survivors at the end? Most movies in this series, there's only 1 survivor. 8. Speaking of the series, this movie doesn't seem to fit in with the rest of the movies at all.",Jason X

Jason X keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. It never fails to be entertaining!! Its action packed with GREAT special effects. Some of the best explosions i have seen before. This movie is suited for lovers of all genres. I believe everyone can enjoy this movie. I recommend this movie to anyone. I am a non-horror fan, and i still LOVED IT. Thats very unusual. Even the trailer for this movie is the most entertaining i have ever seen. I urge everyone to go see this movie. YOU WONT REGRET IT!!! I loved this movie.

465,omb I,"the surroundings may change, the killing stays the same",5,29 November 2001,"It had been quiet for eight years, but James Isaacs decided to break the silence. The result: Jason X, Friday the 13th Part 10. Everyone expected something different of course, something spectacular. If not, it is very hard to wake up interest for a horror figure of the eighties. Everything around Jason X seems to live up to those expectations, but then after seeing the movie you realise nothing has changed. Jason is still Jason, a mass murderer with an Ice-Hockey Mask who doesn't say a word, just kills everyone he meets. In the first place it is not clear why Jason came back from the dead after the ""final"" chapter, Jason Goes To Hell: The Final Friday. Isaacs doesn't worry about explaining this. Besides the beginning goes very fast; we don't see anything of Camp Crystal Lake and Jason is send to space very quickly so you don't have time to analyse the details of his capture. Yes, Jason has been captured and now we find him in space. There the spectator knows it is going to be different, or at least that we be logical.No way. Jason is the same cold killer as in the former movies, kills in the same way and doesn't give any surprises. And when you get finally used to that, he suddenly changes physically,  at a moment the spectator already accepted Jason stayed the same, when he reminds the former parts from the 80's and enjoys those memories. So no one wants this Robocop version of Jason, except the real fans of course (beware of part XI!!). Jason X is a disappointment, in spite of the special effects and the presence of the very pretty Lexa Doig.",Jason X

Refreshing are the methods that the cover boy uses to get rid of the menacing teenagers: the drill, the liquid nitrogen sink, but he certainly enjoyed using his machete in the usual manner (through skin, past the bone).

As I think back to all the Fridays since the original, everyone of them had a part you remember well although the movie as a whole wasnt as good as it could of been. This movie does a great job coming up with new and unique ways to not only Kill Jason but doesnt take away from sequels (or prequels if you may)and really comes off as a whole movie that is very enjoyable and exciting. Not only does ""evil get an upgrade"" but the whole movie is a 14 million dollar marvel. They really squeezed every penny out of it. I was really surprised.

Sure, some are bad, but hey, how much worse could those be then that movie. They can't come up with anything new these days. Comic book character movies, damn a.. remakes, or freaking sequels. How can they waste 14 Mill on such a bad script? Didn't they read it before deciding on making a movie out of it? And who finances such bull? They must be proud on their return of money. But I guess they lost anyhow, at least I hope so. No plot, not scary, not even a slasher. You can guess that I did not like that piece of crap at all (1 of 10). Waste of time, money, talent if any, and space in the theaters. I am happy I just recorded it from TV and did not spend anything but lost time on it. Right up there with Battlefield Earth.

471,Frustrator,It just doesn't get any worse than this!,2,13 April 2003,"This movie is incredible... incredibly BAD, that is. I can't believe that any screenwriter and/or director is willing to put their name on this--it simply has to be an attempt on professional suicide in the business.The script is so full of cliches that belong in slasher-films of the '80s, not the new millennium. Good old Jason Voorhees gets cryogenically frozen and is thawed up several hundred years into the future, and guess what... NOTHING has changed at all. There are still tons of beautiful model-like teenagers showing their belly-buttons and having casual sex, and they all still get slaughtered by the monster in the hockeymask. This time around, however, he gets and upgrade in the last 15-20 minutes of the film, and is turned into some kind of hybrid man/monster/machine killing apparatus.The dialogue is below even the worst standards, the plot far from new, the acting is just above kindergarten ability... frankly, I don't know why any studio would jump onto a script like this.For God's sake, I know it's just another teen slasher movie based on an ancient franchise, but for crying out loud: Who ever said that innovative writing is forbidden in films like this one? I was very tempted to watch the entire movie on fast forward, but didn't.In the end, though, there is one positive thing about my Jason X experience: Luckily, I wasn't the one who paid for the rental.",Jason X

For gore, it does one of the best jobs that I've seen yet.  The movie also is original in many aspects.  The first is that, well, the setting is in space, almost 450 years in the future.  The second is that Jason Voorheis gets turned into a terminator-like creature, unlike the normal hockey mask (although he does wear the hockey mask for the first 3/4 of the movie.

Shouldn't he be back in the bedroom making love to the girl? Well, who cares? Sadly, most of the film goes on like this with many things not being explained and we are taken on a magic carpet ride to an ignorant future! Wow! Other than these dissapointing aspects of the film, I found some scenes absolutely hilarious and this is well as it balances the rest of the movie that is horribly confusing and painstakingly slow some times. The retro scene has to be the best as I have never seen something so funny in my entire life. Kudos to the director and editor for that sequence. Also, as with most slasher flicks I expected a lot of T&A however I was greatly dissapointed until that retro scene, as there were next to no nudity in the entire film!!! Sure, the girls were mainly great but still, the only one I wanted to see nude dies 10 minutes into the film. In conclusion, I would give it many pluses to see Jason fling 2 sorority sweethearts around in their sleeping bags in the retro scene, but other then that I have to say that the film was slow, clunky, and horribly boring.",Jason X

Thankfully, this movie ignored the 9th version of the series and went straight to the story.  In the beginning, Jason is cryogenically frozen with a woman and they are not discovered until 400-500 years later.  The two are found by a space crew made up of a greedy captain and inexperienced hot science professors.  When they melt the bodies(including Jason those morons!) Jason is out on a killing spree on this ship.Like in all movies of the series, this movie has awful acting, tons of gore, and hot young teenagers.  This movie may seem like the best one of the series but it should not take any pride in it. The only noteworthy thing about watching this awful movie is that it is noted as the horror movie with the most amount of murders. It's true but they went over the limit; at least 1 person was attacked or killed every minute in the stupidest way. Also, may I note that this movie is supposed to be a horror, but when I am watching this I sometimes think they tried to make this film a comedy. Not a good combination. Anyway, for the die hard Jason fans, go see it. For the average movie-goer, you can skip it no big deal. 3 stars out of 10.",Jason X

Lexa Doig pulls off a good performance showing that she is able to play something other then a android/warship, hopefully we'll se more movies from her. Obviously a continuing problem in Jason is the fact that NO WHERE is it explained on how Jason came back from Jason Goes to Hell! Which this isn't the first time this has been done. They also continue in changing Jason's appearance from Human, to weird freak, back to almost Human. But I guess depth of story was never the point of Friday the 13th only death.

Jason X starts out at Crystal Lake Research Facility, where the subject Jason Voorhees is being prepped for cryonation. However, some militrastic pencil pushers decide that they could benefit from his DNA. Naturally, he gets free, kills some people and stalks the booty-licious scientist that originally wanted him to be cryogenetically frozen.  She accidently freezes herself and Mr. Voorheees.  455 years later, a space crew finds both of them, takes them to their ship and was able to revive the scientist, not Jason.  As you might expect Jason lives anyway and (in violent fashion) all hell breaks loose.This is one of the better films in the seires, but will never be as good as Parts 1 and 6.  It also contains one of the most coolest, original deaths ever that involves nitrogen.  The effects were good, the story good, the acting..... When did that ever matter in an F13 movie anyway?  Kane Hodder once again dominates the Jason persona, especially the brand spaking new ""Uber"" Jason, a large Robot.  This is also the first film in the series that takes the Dark Comedy movie, like so many other franchises today (Nightmare on Elm Street, Child's Play, etc.)Overall this was a good film.

There are movies in the world, they don't want to tell you always 'bout real life, but they just want to entertain, and I think this is one of the way of entertainment with much more fun than the usual Hollywood-like-stuff.Indeed this movie has an own sort of quality, it is made as a high budget movie (you see that e.g. on the quality of the special effects) and expresses like ""Bride of Chucky"" a revival of the famous figures of the eighties like Jason (what was his real name?), Chucky or Michael Myers transfered and modernized for the new century/present time.By the way, in Germany we have a big discussion on these days about movies like Jason X or games like ""Counter Strike"". I just can say, I never came out of ""Braindead"", ""Day of the Dead"", ""Halloween"" or any other movie and wanted to kill any people, so if you feel so, dear reader, then please consult your doctor, because movies dont kill anyone, they are only something chemical projected on the wall, the question is, what we make of them, and that means, we are not guided with any movie to kill people, we always live in the wrong world, if we wish to kill... the only way to escape of this is to change our world... no one deserves to die - in reality...

For the folks that have seen a few or all, know what is going on and what the purpose is, and if you have watched at least a couple (3-4) of the chapters then this one is just another good old fashioned, Jason movie, and you don't really expect some big oscar winning mega hit. I chose to, on my 2 days off, before going to see Jason X, ""catch up"" on the other 9 chapters first, just to get a fresh idea of how they have changed in 20 years, over all I thought Jason X was really good, although they could have done without Kane Hodders own hair (or at least it looked like his own, if you ever seen him unmasked), vs. the old bald style.  I have heard this got bad ratings and i didn't know what to expect, but like I said if you really haven't followed the other 9 over the years then you'll get some people that thought it wasn't good, this is definitely a different kind of movie, one I don't think you can really just criticize like any other movie, If you like the other 9 chapters, you obviously do understand and put up with the Jason drowning as a boy/ time to get revenge story line, you'll like this one, I give it a 10 and will definitely add it to the other 9, in the old vault of F13'S.",Jason X

It doesn't take itself seriously, which is good.  Around 10 movies it's hard to take something like this seriously.  Some sequences are outright hilarious, such as the homage to the sleeping bag death scene from part 7.This was my first experience of Jason in the theaters, and I must say it was magic.  I got stuck with a crowd that were all fans of ole Jay.  There were cheers at each kill scene; some cheers, I even initiated.  It was a lot of fun.  As a devout horror fan, I came close to shedding a tear by the time the night was over.  It was just magic to me.  Jason X was so much fun and is an homage and parody on itself and the genre.Great ending as well.  My only problem was the lack of suspense, but I think the film made up for it just fine.  I loved it.",Jason X
492,shugthedug,The best in the series,10,16 May 2002,After seeing all of the other 9 Friday the 13th movies by now people would think they were boring but i am a fan of blood guts and gore and simply Jason was getting tired out protecting his beloved camp Crystal Lake but the 10th in the series takes a new turn with Jason being in space and committing many a few good deaths like freezing a woman's head and shattering it but stays faithful to the Friday the 13th tradition of the return of the much beloved machete for fans of horror or Friday the 13th this is a must see Roll on Jason XI,Jason X
493,LIBRARY BOYZ,THE FUNNIEST MOVIE OF THE YEAR,10,21 May 2002,"This is a must see for all Jason fans.  You will see horror, comedy, hot girls naked and great cheesy lines that will have you falling out of your seat. Quality special effects with great new ways to kill people.  Old plot takes a new twist in the future.  We can't wait for the next one.",Jason X
494,Jmm275,Surprisingly well done and gory. Not as ridiculous as people think.,10,9 June 2002,"When i saw this movie in the theater, i was very surprised. Believe it or not, there were only 2 corny parts; SPOILERS, when the girl got upgraded and when jason got upgraded. The killings are intense but most of them are off-screen. Personally, I think that Jason X is the best movie in the Friday the 13th series. Of course, they dont tell you how Jason comes back from the ninth film, nor will they if there is another one. I really hope that there will be another Jason movie, even though I was not a fan of the other films. But if there is one, then it will probably be like this one. The film can often be funny at times, which shows you that they are aren't really taking this film seriously, and they just want to have fun with it. 10 stars out of 10!",Jason X
495,myrnez,Hillarious.,10,18 June 2002,"This movie was excellent!! It has got each and every cliché that a sci-fi horror movie should have. I was about die of laughter when i saw this movie.

496,marty108108,So much fun!,9,14 October 2021,"Listen... A Friday the 13th installment isn't gonna take home a bunch of Academy awards so the criteria I have for the franchise is: does it entertain? And this sure as hell does. See this with a couple of good friends, grab some beverages of your choosing and just have a really fun time! It includes one of the coolest (oooops!) kills of Jason's career and it still looks pretty damn fine some 20 years after it's premier.",Jason X
497,dan_shane,good entry to series,7,21 July 2002,"***possible spoiler alert***Overally, I was pretty impressed with the latest addition to the absolutely knackered friday the 13th franchise. Of course, this film won't win any awards for originality (or anything else for that matter), but never-the-less it's a pretty fun ride to watch which includes some hilariously bad one-liners (""it'll take more than a poke in the ribs....""). At first glance, the prospect of the film being set in space seems a somewhat... well... rubbish one, mainly because horror films in outer space seems rather dated these days and doesn't often pay off *ahem leprechaun 4*, but I think this only adds to the film's limited charm. Because of this we get a breath of fresh air for the Friday franchise, finally getting away from the now tedious Camp Crystal Lake and giving the fans something new to look at. I liked this film but honestly, the ""uber-Jason"" resembles a power ranger on steroids.my rating: 6/10",Jason X
498,binerybass,Jason's back!,7,26 July 2002,"I have missed good old Mr Voorhees over the past few years and i wasnt dissapointed with his return. This film, in my mind is one of the greatest to be released in a few years and is a very worthy addition to the series. the idea of setting it in the future was a good one and the new technologies used to blast Jason with are great. IF YOU DONT WANT ANYTHING SPOILED, PLEASE DONT READ ON. The idea of upgrading Jason, though slightly tacky, was a good idea to finish of the film with. The cyborg women was a bit too much like Lara Croft in the amount she defies the laws of physics for my taste but i'm sure i will get over it.",Jason X
499,llenkow,Stupid is as stupid does,10,31 July 2002,"How can I give this movie a 10 and still say it's stupid? Easy; what would you expect of a movie franchise like this to be? All along we have Jason surviving bullets and knives and being electrocuted by some means, but there was never any suggestion that his ""powers"" were alien in nature(like ""Jason Goes to Hell suggests). Not that electricity would bring him back to life after his body was decayed for awhile(like ""Friday the 13th, Part VI: Jason Lives"" suggested). All of these horror movies can easily have had better plots. Why don't the writers see to it that they do? Because people like me will continue to see such movies simply because it deals with Jason, Freddy, Michael Myers, etc. Since these movies are meant to be ridiculous and silly and incoherent, then I must say that the producer and director have reached their goal. Bravo! Reaching one's goal is what it's all about, so any rating less than a 10 would be unjust.",Jason X
500,ly-1,they should apologize,1,3 October 2002,"wow, i cannot believe they took a cult classic like jason and made this film.  not only are the lines absolutely ridiculous, everything about this movie looked like it should have been played on mystery science theater. from the boy making passes at his girl-robot to the shredder looking ""uber"" jason, only watch this film if you want a laugh.",Jason X
501,fluffyfow,jason x: 2002 space oddesy?,9,20 October 2002,"i have been a long time fan of the teen-slasher flicks because i am from that era, and i thought that this lastest installment was very entertaining and different. it had a new space twist done to it and i really enjoyed the futuristic jason, and maybe he will lost in space forever or maybe he will find a new batch of teenagers to kill in space either way i will be there!!!!!!!!",Jason X
502,AngelicMar,I thought cable was showing wrong movie by mistake...,1,27 October 2009,"OK, so I watched this last night and HAD to write a review for it! I was at a friends house and he was channel surfing, he landed on this movie. The cable info said that the show we were watching was ""Jason X"". My friend and his roommate start talking about how Jason is in a spaceship, he's woken up and killing these people. For about 15 minutes I thought they were lying to me. I thought for sure that the cable programming was showing a different movie in error.All of a sudden, Jason appears onto the screen and I couldn't believe my eyes. I remember this moving coming out in theatres. It seemed like a made for TV movie. Not only were the effects horrible but the script was a joke and seemed as if written by a 10 year old.Most absurd line in the movie had to go to the professor when he got stuck in the room with Jason when everyone else ran off. Jason picks up his machete beside the professor (I believe it was taken from him) the professor turns around (back towards Jason) and yells out to the rest of the crew ""Everyone! It's OK! He just came back for his machete!"" Like actually thinking Jason was going to spare him because he 'allowed' him his machete back.Good lord! I couldn't even watch the whole thing. It had to be the worst movie I've ever seen in my life and I'm not even exaggerating a little. Horrible script, horrible acting, horrible effects, cheap overall. And did I say it was horrible??",Jason X
503,kosaldo,Kill me for watching this piece of junk,2,29 May 2004,"OK, i heard a lot of stories about evil Jason from Friday the 13th series so i decided to take a look at it. First one, and definitely also the last, of the series that came to my hands was this insult to cinematography mystically called Jason X. First 10 minutes i ignored all the flaws, worst acting ever seen and this laughable slaughter machine, second 20 minutes i found myself laughing cynically at every ""suspense"" moment and from then on i paused the movie on numerous occasions just to see how long will it take before the end.Jason X is the ultimate joke which i strongly suggest you avoid at all costs and means. Some movies are so bad that you get to like them just because of that, but Jason X unfortunately doesn't fit even into this category. It's boring piece of junk, hosting the most talentless platform of actors ever gathered around and extremely stupid plot line. Lexa Doig is a cute girl, but her acting skills will probably degrade her only to 3rd rated TV flicks shown in the morning hours.Thank you sergeant Brudski for whipping Jason to that lake which could possibly give a new bright idea for producers of this crap (Jason vs Nessie?), but you definitely won't pull my bowls once again.",Jason X
504,NateGrace,"Good in ways, bad in other ways",10,1 March 2003,"First of all Friday The 13th series are the best. They are the most common horror films out there. Jason X has some bad glitches in it. If Rowan and Jason been frozen for 455 some years why hasn't any one found them by then? Or at least found the 8 - 10 dead guards up stairs? The film makers made it open for many options since it took place in space which is good. But it did miss alot of details in the beginning. So what now, is Freddy vs. Jason gonna take place after JGTH? (Jason Goes to Hell) and skip Jason X or is Jason X going to come over FvJ? Thats where they messed up the most, I don't think they can make another sequel off of Jason X cause his look totally changed and it wont be the same. Kane did a very good job with acting as Jason, he's the best so far. The new theme music isn't the same anymore, it just doesn't give you the feeling as (if you saw the other movies) you had during the other films... 10/10",Jason X
505,bullfunky,Out of This World Bad,1,25 May 2003,"Bones are chilled and careers are ruined in this newest chapter to a story that will unfortunately never go away. Jason, as he is known to close friends, is reborn once more to wreak unspeakable horrors in space-a horrific realm with no oxygen, no gravity, and no plot. All hopes for a storyline were lost somewhere in the first few weeks of production...of the idea for this film. If Jason would simply explain how he manages to resurge so many times, or if anyone simply had the balls to ask him, I would not be nearly as frustrated. I guess I still just don't see what the big deal is. Plenty of people have died in lakes. What makes this cat sooooooo special. Maybe it's the mask. Somebody should really tell him that the Andrew Lloyd Weber look is out. Oh well. At the end of the film, Jason is reconstructed into UberJason, a glorified, gayer version of Spawn. This was stolen straight from obscure art film Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze. The masked marauder of murder then survives several explosions and a virtual reality ruse before falling at the hands of a cosmic piggy back ride. The movie, like a derelict father, sends us to bed with no answers, just the heartwarming sensation that Jason is still alive and well. I just don't understand why anyone would fight him now. He's been to hell!! What's more extreme than that? Oh why couldn't he have been in other movies that sucked and killed all their characters? Ehem, Schumacher! Regardless, if you're looking for a good laugh and a reason to end your life, I would recommend it. It's good. Honest.",Jason X
506,Shevchenko7,Friday Movies getting worse each movie !!!!!!!,1,29 March 2003,"What a pathetic idea to do a Body Count flick in Space and even worse was the acting shown in the movie. I saw an interview with the director and he said ""We were throwing idas around of where Jason X could be set"" and they included ... Africa and the North Pole. why make a movie when you dont know what to do for a storyline??? Ideas should come first and then decide to make the movie! the 2 good parts were jason smashing a womans face after freezing it first with nitrogen and when he's got a sleeping bag with a camper inside and he is smashing her into the tree.0/10",Jason X
507,friarcat,"Self-Parodying, but intentional",6,19 August 2003,"So, it's another basic slasher flick mixed liberally with elements of the first Alien.  The plot is non-existent, but through ten(or eleven, nowadays), there's been maybe three plotlines between them. It's not scary.. it's not even really gory. However, the humor, which I think is intentional this time about, is absolutely hilarious.SPOILERS BELOW:Scenes such as:  The scared chick taking off in the shuttle and ramming right back into the ship like it's some kind of cartoon.  I laughed out loud.The two virtual reality campers distracting our villain from killing the real teens saying:  ""Wanna drink some beer?  Or smoke some pot?  Or have premarital sex?  We LOOOVE premarital sex!!"".  Taking their tops off, then tucking themselves into sleeping bags so Jason can beat them to death together.  That's absolute comedy gold.END SPOILERSOverall, it's a movie you watch with your stoner buddies to laugh at and make fun of, not to be scared.  Not being a Jason purist, I enjoyed it.",Jason X
508,micy022,What was this????,1,30 July 2003,"This movie was so bad I just had to write a comment.  If you've seen any of the previous flix, well... its pretty bad.  First you ask yourself how could he be alive if he went to hell.  They completely closed the series with ""Jason Goes to Hell"", so where did he come from? Makes you feel like this isn't even a Jason movie. It shouldn't be.  And what's with the horrible new Jason attire.  That was awful. IN SHORT, NO OPENING, BAD PLOT, ONE LINERS ALL OVER THE PLACE (CHEEEZY), BAD EFFECTS. ""Big"" waste of film; no really, do you know how expensive film is? Not Cheap! The only consistency this installment had with the others was the infamous nude scene, which they always find a way to put in. So there you have it.",Jason X
509,kyotohellfiend,Why the bad views? This is the best Friday since PtVI,10,15 August 2003,"Less of a review of the film, more sheer confusion at the spate of poor comments this film has received.Maybe the large percentage of 'critics' are not popcorn munching Friday fans?Okay so the space setting may be a little removed from the norm, but hey, they had to get out of that forest eventually, and to be honest, so long as Jason commits his usual string of violent original deaths, who cares where he is.Anyway, back to that string of violent Death, many of Jason's best kills are in this movie (among the 30 odd he dispatches!) the frozen face smash, the corkscrew, even a send up of the sleeping bag kill and my favourite, the stylish neck break and throw to the floor (arguably just because I hated the kid he done it to so much =0) Lets be fair, that's all this film ever promised, and hell does it deliver.To put it into perspective, This film is about Jason, not the dumb kids smoking weed while they should have been in acting class, its about Jason, and in this movie Jason is quite simply 'cool', he looks great (I like the new mask, although I appreciate some do not) he moves great, he kills better. I only hope this Kirt dude can get Jason down as well as Mr Hodder!!If you were expecting a sci fi action, go watch NemesisAs a general movie, for people new to the franchise, I'd give this 8/10For Friday Fans 9.9/10So stop be so negative, and enjoy this mayhem for what it is, erm.. mayhem!!",Jason X

The acting is the worst i have ever seen in my life not to mention the soundtrack which sounded like a computer midi sound it was that pathetic.In conclusion i had more entertainment when i was vomiting out of rage for seeing this utter crap of a movie.My favour to you all is to take my advice and avoid this movie at all costs.",Jason X
511,smilli3,a painful death,1,19 May 2007,"I am going to keep this brief - as labouring over a review for this would be a fruitless waste of time for me and you.Acting performances were typically laughable. As for the horror, we have all seen more frightening displays on the Disney channel. The suspense factor was butchered from several angles, not least by the seemingly randomised synthetic score and game-show type camera-work. The violence was bloody but not excessive, and may have been a little more thrilling if I was not completely unenthusiastic about the entire setup. Still nothing was gruesome enough to penetrate my scepticism. Worst of all, the pitiable concept was not played up as a ""Funny, cos its rubbish"" gag. Even for a Friday 13th movie, Its just plain rubbish.",Jason X
512,jackm1997,Mon the Jason X,7,17 June 2012,slight spoilers#Its honestly not that bad. I've seen worse in the series than I have in this movie. I actually got some enjoyment out of it. it was funny and Jason was bad ass as usual. I didn't get the whole cyborg Jason thing though. they could have kept him the same. I'm glad the series is over though. I sat for two days trying to watch them all and I'm glad this was the final one. its not as bad as Jason goes to hell or a new beginning. I just think it's a classic slasher; a group of people trapped in one place and a mad man trying to kill them. So please don't judge it before you see it because no matter what anyone says its not that bad even though he's somehow in space.,Jason X

514,djordjekn,At least it's not Camp Crystal Lake again,5,13 December 2015,"Friday the 13th was never an amazing franchise. It provided fun kills, scary moments and a solid amount of gore at it's best and awful acting, characters and plot points at it's worst. This one is not that awful though (It's certainly an improvement compared to Jason Goes To Hell). They didn't decide to beat the dead horse again and return to Crystal Lake but in retrospect, the films that were NOT about the usual formula of Friday the 13th we're all familiar with were actually the worst. This time around we're provided with some lame excuse for Jason to go to space/the future so he can kill more annoying teens. The series obviously needed a change but in my opinion, this was not the way to do it. The acting and characterization is dreadful but we never expected much from these movies in that department anyway. At the very least it's entertaining, and has some fun kills. Also, for some reason characters just love to spit out cheesy one liners right before die (?) which was a pathetic attempt at comedy if that was the intention. I think this sequel was completely unnecessary, and it didn't fit anywhere in the series time-line. It's still a solid choice if you're bored and want to kill an hour and a half though.",Jason X

We are supposed to pretend that this movie never happened for the movies to make sense. If only it never did happen... This movie does not even follow any of what Friday the 13th is supposed to be about! I cannot believe how some people think this is such a great movie. I am glad I did not spend my own money on it, it was a gift. The video store where my friend works at had so many copies that they were giving them away...for free! No wonder that each Jason movie that comes out does worse and worse. The writers no longer care about genuine plots and scripts, they keep recycling the same thing over and over.",Jason X

Give us something you can make blow our minds away. I would to see a new one come and make it more scary . I know you can do it and am sure plenty people will agree to what I have said . You can also make it more than 2 hrs and we over the camp area scenes its getting boring and am sure the actor think so too. Make it in a different area like maybe in Russia or maybe Transylvania that sounds scary too. I don't even see they making anything scary as Jason movies or even Freddy either, things start getting boring we need more real horror not those movies they making with lots of suspense and a little bit of horror. It's not the same anymore. Please do something great and make us be amaze of something new with real horror!!!",Jason X

A movie I could enjoy watching again. This is sort of a 'Jason meets Star Trek' blend, certainly not a typical horror film, no doubt hardcore horror/slasher fans are the ones giving it a rating of 1. I thought 'Uber Jason' was great, Lexa Doig is hot hot hot, the scene where Jason beats one topless camping chick with the other topless camping chick in their own sleeping bags in the VR room was hilarious!

I have been watching the Friday the 13th series since I was a teenager, I'm now 21 and I still love watching them. Jason X however was very different from the others. Firstly more modern, better quality camera work etc but still a really cheesy film non the less. Jason really does seem to be some sort of super-sonic being. He's impervious to all weapons and is attacked numerous times all in the space of an hour and he still keeps coming. Impossibilities do become possible in this movie and some scenes really did have me laughing my head off.

Jason is one of my favorites but there's no way this movie is considered horror. If you are the kind of person who likes the blood/gore/suspense of a classic horror flick do not watch this movie. You will be greatly disappointed. Jason X is far too sci-fi and not enough scary. Also, I would love to see the day where the idiotic people in these movies realize that they can beat the crap out of Jason all they want and he won't die. It would be nice to see something different going on here.
