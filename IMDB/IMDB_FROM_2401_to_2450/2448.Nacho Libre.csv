0,MartinHafer,"Basically, a one-joke film.",6,21 February 2019,"The title ""Nacho Libre"" is a take-off on the Mexican word for wrestling, Lucha Libre. And, as far as Nacho goes, the title character is named Ignacio and Nacho is a variation of this name...sort of like James and Jim or Richard and Dick.Ignacio (Jack Black) is a monk, though he longs to be a wrestler. And, after finding a most unlikely looking partner, they both enter the world of Mexican wrestling. Ultimately, however, he is worried what will happen when the other monks discover what he's doing in his spare time.This really is the movie...period. Monk becomes wrestler. Not a lot of jokes and Black's character becomes a bit tiresome after a bit. Purely a time-passer and not much more.",Nacho Libre
1,SnoopyStyle,slightly amusing in a few scenes,5,23 December 2015,"Ignacio (Jack Black) is the cook in a monastery orphanage. Nacho falls in love with the new teacher Sister Encarnación (Ana de la Reguera). He befriends thief Steven (Héctor Jiménez) as they train to be Mexican wrestlers Nacho and Esqueleto.Director Jared Hess of Napoleon Dynamite fame gets a leading comedic talent. It doesn't really work. There are a couple a slightly amusing moments. Jack Black puts on such an unusual mannerism that it doesn't allow the humor to shine. Instead, it's an one-note character that keeps repeating. This seems like a skit character given a full length movie. He's also not that lovable.",Nacho Libre
2,Prismark10,Friar in the mask,6,11 June 2016,"This is a goofy offbeat comedy set is Mexico where Jack Black plays Friar Ignacio stuck with cooking for orphans in a remote monastery.He teams up with a street kid to form a tag team and although getting some bizarre beating in the ring they earn enough money to get better food for the orphans. Brother Ignacio also hopes to impress the new nun who he finds rather appealing. However as the monastery frowns on wrestling, he fights as a masked wrestlerAfter a while tired of losing and wanting to make money as a winner he challenges top wrestler Ramses and hope he can soar like an eagle.This is a quirky underdog story with a right blend of humour and action when the action is consigned to the ring but does not always flow altogether when the story is away from the ring when it can easily become dull despite some gross out humour.",Nacho Libre
3,claudio_carvalho,Awfully Unfunny – Certainly One of the Worst Movies I Have Ever Seen,1,1 February 2015,"The monk Ignacio (Jack Black) loves the orphan in the monastery and dreams on becoming a wrestler. He teams up with the bum Esqueleto (Héctor Jiménez) and wears a mask to secretly fight in the arena for amateurs with the alias Nacho. They are losers but they receive money for the fight that Ignacio uses to buy better food for the orphans. When the gorgeous Sister Encarnación (Ana de la Reguera) comes to live in the monastery, Ignacio has feelings for her. When the monks discover his secret, Ignacio is expelled from the monastery. Now he needs to win the number one wrestler Ramses (Cesar Gonzalez) to become a professional fighter. The awfully unfunny ""Nacho Libre"" is certainly one of the worst movies i have ever seen. The story is stupid and corny and even Jack Black is impossible to save this doomed crap. Maybe people with IQ problem may laugh watching this terrible comedy. The only thing worthwhile in this movie is the gorgeous actress Ana de la Reguera from the beautiful Veracruz. My vote is one (awful).Title (Brazil): ""Nacho Libre""",Nacho Libre
4,lee_eisenberg,no pretense about being completely silly,10,5 December 2006,"""Nacho Libre"" is one of those movies that they crank out from time to time with absolutely no pretense about being totally goofy. The movie has no artistic value, and doesn't pretend to. It's an excuse to see Jack Black be his usual crazy self, which he does without even trying.I will say that it's not the funniest movie that I've ever seen. At times, the whole thing seems like kind of a cliché, what with him trying to make something of himself. But like I said, they make no pretense about being anything but silly, unadulterated fun.So, just expect to have a nice, brainless time while watching it. Even if, like me, you're not really into pro-wrestling, it's still possible to like the movie. And besides, Sister Encarnacion is really hot!",Nacho Libre
5,jboothmillard,Nacho Libre,5,18 April 2009,"I knew it was a film with a wrestling theme with a difference, and I knew the lead star, so I decided to give it go, from director Jared Hess (Napolean Dynamite). Basically Ignacio (Jack Black, also producing) grows up as an orphan in a Mexican monastery, and has become a cook feeding orphans. He dreams of become a wrestler, and when meets love interest, nun Sister Encarnación (Ana De La Reguera), he decides to don a mask and cape to try and impress her. He also finds a sidekick in skinny street urchin Esqueleto (Héctor Jiménez) to help him out. Even being not very good at wrestling, Ignacio, aka Nacho gets paid for losing, but really he wants to be paid for winning to help the children. Of course the monastery heads were bound to find out about Ignacio's ""sinning"", and there is the moment of doubt, but he pulls himself together, finally wins a fight with a grand prize, and buys a new bus with it. Also starring Darius A. Rose as Chancho, Moises Arias as Juan Pablo, Carlos Maycotte as Segundo Nuñez, Richard Montoya as Guillermo, Cesar 'Silver King' Gonzalez as Ramses and Peter Stormare as Emperor. Black with that Mexican accent and a singing moment is an appealing and likable underdog, and while the story is nothing exciting, I suppose you could give a go, make your own mind up. Worth watching!",Nacho Libre
6,ccthemovieman-1,Outrageously Funny & Much Better Than I Expected,10,17 February 2008,"I make no apologies for liking this movie. It seemed everyone at the video store, from the manager on down, all thought otherwise....but I took a shot, rented it, and laughed my butt off watching this film. Now I own it.Jack Black was hilarious as the monk-pro wrestling wannabe ""Nacho."" The premise alone is humorous: an overweight Mexican monk who would rather be a famous wrestler. It doesn't say much for his spirituality, but it made for a lot of laughs.It's all outrageous, absurd humor, not meant to do anything but evoke laughs, at any cost......just harmless fun. Detractors should keep that in mind. I have no interest in wrestling but the wrestling scenes in this film had me constantly laughing out loud. Black's tag-team partner, ""Esquelito"" (Hector Jimenez) was just as funny as the main star, if not funnier. Just the look on his face with all his teeth sticking out was funny!I have no interest in being a monk, either, but I know none of these ""monks"" in here were realistic figures, especially the nun: ""Sister Encarcion"" (Ana de la Reguera ). No offense, but only in the movies are nuns this beautiful. Wow, Reguera looked like a cross between Penelope Cruz and a young Winona Ryder. And, she wasn't just beautiful, but a sweet lady, too.Although it's a comedy, the story had some nice touches of sentimentality and humanity, namely: ""Nacho's"" attitude adjustment, his genuine compassion for orphaned kids that the Brothers and Sisters took care of, and his basic desire to do good despite a very weak commitment to ""vows.""Maybe that's why there are so many critics of this film: it wasn't mean-edged and nasty enough to satisfy them. However,those who appreciate good slapstick will like this movie.Also, if you appreciate bold, beautiful colors, you'll find this an attractive movie. There was a feast of brilliant colors shown. I was impressed how much effort was made to make this movie look nice in addition to getting laughs.In, a very, very pleasant surprise: much better than I ever hoped it would be....and recommended for those wanting a bunch of belly laughs for an hour-and-a-half.",Nacho Libre
7,Tweekums,"Very silly, but also very funny",8,15 August 2019,"This Jack Black comedy sees him playing Nacho, a young monk working as a cook in the remote Mexican monastery/orphanage where he was raised. As a child he dreamt of becoming a luchador, wrestler, but this is forbidden as such activities are seen as a sign of vanity. He regularly goes into town to get food for the orphans and one day he is robbed by a street thief, Steven. Shortly afterwards he sees champion masked luchador Ramses being mobbed by fans... he has a plan. He persuades Steven to become a tag-wrestler with him; if he wears a mask the monastery won't find out what he is doing. They aren't very good at wrestling but still they get paid so continue, determined to get better and turn professional so he can buy a bus for the orphans and thus impress the attractive Sister Encarnación.Not surprisingly this film is very silly; thankfully it also provides lots of laughs. Much of this is physical with fights that are funny but still feel like the characters are wrestling and some hilarious training scenes. Jack Black is hilarious as Nacho; his put-on Mexican accent is so ridiculous it is funny rather than offensive. Héctor Jiménez is equally funny as his wrestling partner Steven. The rest of the cast are solid although their characters are mostly not comically. The story doesn't deliver any real surprises but it does serve to deliver the laughs. Overall this may be fairly light weight but I'd recommend it to anybody wanting a good laugh and little to cause offence.",Nacho Libre
8,Hey_Sweden,Sometimes you wear stretchy pants in your room. It's for fun.,6,31 May 2020,"If nothing else, ""Nacho Libre"" is a reasonably amusing and endearing vehicle for the talented star, Jack Black. He's actually a bit more restrained than is typical for him, taking the time to create an engaging character with some real heart. Nacho Libre is a friar at a Mexican monastery who works as the cook. Determined to do right by the orphans living there, and just as determined to win the love of beautiful nun Sister Encarnacion (Ana de la Reguera), he realizes his lifes' dream of being a Luchador, or Mexican wrestler.Concocted by the creators of ""Napoleon Dynamite"", this amiable feature may not deliver true belly laughs, and it can get childishly crude, but it's hard to dislike or dismiss. It does benefit from genuinely likeable individuals at the core of the story. Sure, Blacks' ""accent"" doesn't exactly cut it, but director Jared Hess (who co-wrote the script with Mike White and his wife Jerusha) never aims to take ANY of this very seriously. The result may be a fairly inconsequential movie, but it entertains adequately for a well-paced 93 minutes. The ring action is fun, and Black does have some chemistry with Hector Jimenez, who plays the street kid who becomes his steadfast companion. Their escapades are good for some laughs, such as when Jimenez is pursued by a corpulent admirer, or when Black pretends to be part of an ensemble of musicians.""Nacho Libre"" makes no attempt to be ""realistic"". It merely shows comedy lovers a good time for an hour and a half, with a blessed lack of pretentiousness.Six out of 10.",Nacho Libre
9,dbborroughs,Sweet story of a friar finding himself in wrestling is much different then the trailers made it out to be,8,23 September 2006,"This is the story of Jack Black's friar who is trying to find his place in the world and in the monastery. Loving wrestling, but forbidden to do so, he begins life as a masked wrestler in order to get money for food for the orphans in his charge. Spurred on further by the appearance of a new nun, Black continues to wrestle in order to prove to himself and the others that he is somebody.This is a sweet amusing character study that has a few laugh out loud moments, but not a constant stream of jokes. Clearly this hurt the film at the box office where it did well, but not as well as some had hoped. Personally I really liked the movie, much more than I thought I would. Initially I stayed away from the film because I didn't like Napoleon Dynamite, the directors previous film, and because I didn't know what to make from the trailers. I was shocked when I finally got to see it because this is a sweet (in a good way) story of an outsider trying to find a place in the world and with in himself where he belongs.This is a gem. If you want a silly feel good movie this is the perfect tonic. Definitely worth a bag of popcorn and a glass of soda.",Nacho Libre
10,george.schmidt,Hit-and-miss Black vehicle,7,27 June 2006,"NACHO LIBRE (2006) *** Jack Black, Ana de la Reguera, Hector Jiminez, Darius Rose, Peter Stormare. Hit-and-miss comic vehicle for Black as put-upon chef of a Mexican orphanage who dreams of something better for himself and finding it in the unlikely form of becoming a masked wrestler when his charges find themselves with insufficient funds for proper nourishment. Written by Mike White and filmmaker Jared and his significant other Jerusha Hess, the screenplay leaves one wanting more for Black to do but nonetheless gets his ya-yas out with some funny slapstick instead (the wrestling is a combo of Bugs Bunny meets Lou Costello) . A disappointment in some regards, yet de la Reguera as a nun Black falls for channeling Penelope Cruz in an Almodovar flick provides some sweet, sexy purity to the chicanery at hand and Jiminez is a riot as the high shrieking sidekick.",Nacho Libre
11,ferguson-6,A Man of Science,5,18 June 2006,"Greetings again from the darkness. The husband and wife Hess team's follow-up to the smash cult hit ""Napoleon Dynamite"" is a free fall to mediocrity. Lacking the multitude of funny/interesting characters, ""Nacho Libre"" is little more than a comic vehicle for the very talented Jack Black to spout his poorly written lines with a fake Spanish accent and run around shirtless in the world's worst wrestling costume (with stretchy pants).Since it is written purely as a comedy, no mention should be made of the political incorrectness ... astral, that is what comedy is based on. The sad thing is, the Hess team and the usually great Mike White have tried to pass off the script as first rate comedy, when actually it is for the most part, just plain boring.Relative newcomer Ana de la Reguera is beautiful and pulls off the angelic nun role with ease, but Peter Stormare is woefully miscast as some sort of mystical guru. No other characters are even worth mentioning. Weak writing and casting make for a way-too-few-laughs comedy.",Nacho Libre
12,anaconda-40658,Nacho Black.,6,2 July 2015,"Nacho Libre (2006): Dir: Jared Hess / Cast: Jack Black, Hector Jimenez, Ana de la Reguera, Richard Montoya, Peter Stormare: Often funny take on wrestling as a monk who cooks terrible meals for orphans dreams of becoming a top Mexican wrestler. This is so to afford better food for the orphans under his care. Hilarious idea follows formula with awkward training and losing bouts until the predicted championship fight that hasn't the comic payoff that it should have. Nacho Libre and his partner were funnier when they were paid as losers. Directed by Jared Hess who had great success with the independent comedy Napoleon Dynamite. Here the budget is bigger but the screenplay isn't as effective as the simple delivery of the other film. Jack Black as Nacho is the strength of the film while Hector Jimenez plays a street bum who would become his partner and together they make a great losing combination. Why the film couldn't play out more on this level as oppose to creating winner, is beyond me. Ana de la Reguera is flat as a new teacher Nacho falls for. Her function is to do nothing more than be a conquest that is never convincing to begin with. Peter Stormare has done grittier roles of far more quality than this. He plays a character billed as Emperor and that is about it. Amusing view of wrestling and the adrenalin to be something more than the screenwriter seems to arise too. Score: 6 / 10",Nacho Libre
13,movieman_kev,A lifeless and unfunny Two Stooges,3,11 December 2006,"Ignacio (Jack Black) is a cook in a Mexican orphanage who , along with a common vagabond, chooses to moonlight as a Luchador in order to win money for said orphanage. He is constantly ridiculed by the monks, the only one to show compassion towards him being the beautiful Sister Encarnacion whom he has a secret crush on. The movie chooses the low-brow path which while not in itself a bad thing when done with originality and/ or flair. Sadly this film has neither and simply repeats the same two 'gags' over and over again with no style. Fans of Napoleon Dynamite or Jack Black might laugh a few (VERY few) times, but everyone else would be well advised to avoid this stinker.DVD Extras: Commentary by writer/director Jared Hess, co-writer/producer Mike White and actor Jack Black; 5 featurettes; Jack Sings 2 songs; 3 Deleted scenes; 4 Promo spots; 3 Photo galleries; & trailers for ""Flushed Away"", ""Barnyard"", ""Mission Impossible III"", ""An Inconvenient Truth"", and ""Over The Hedge"" DVD-Rom content: Theatrical website archive; and a comic book creator",Nacho Libre
14,The_Void,Tired and unfunny comedy,4,3 February 2008,"I have to admit, I was a fan of wrestling when I was a kid; and the subject matter is ripe for making a comedy film about. I'm a big fan of Jack Black in almost everything I've seen him and firmly (used to) believe that he can carry even the dullest film, and although I haven't seen it; Jared Hess' 2004 film Napoleon Dynamite is one of the most highly rated comedy of the last few years...so why is this film so dry? The film is set in Mexico and Jack Black plays a Mexican. This is part of the reason why the film is so lacking; it seems that Jared Hess was too happy to focus on the silly accents and the jokes suffer as a result of that. None of the characters are particularly interesting either. Jack Black usually makes the best of what he's given, but even he isn't able to make the lead role interesting. There's plenty of slapstick and childish humour as you'd probably expect; most of it not funny at all. The central character, aside from being a wannabe wrestler also cares for kids and wants to be a friar - and this subplot comes off as being very forced and uninteresting. Overall, this film was not funny and I don't recommend it!",Nacho Libre
15,namashi_1,Jack Black At His Best!,10,25 July 2013,"Jack Black is widely known for his impeccable comic timing. The actor has delivered several hilarious performances all through his impressive career, but his work in 'Nacho Libre' ranks as his finest. And even as a film, its an enjoyable comedy!'Nacho Libre' Synopsis: Berated all his life by those around him, a monk follows his dream and dons a mask to moonlight as a Luchador (Mexican wrestler).Loosely based on the real life of Fray Tormenta, a catholic priest, who, had a 23 year long career as a masked Luchador. 'Nacho Libre' is funny from start to finish, what if some of the jokes are offensive. There is no major flaw in the narrative, because the protagonist's journey amuses & entertains. The Screenplay Written by Jared Hess, Jerusha Hess & Mike White progresses wonderfully & is filled with comic moments. Jared Hess has Directed the film well. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are decent.Jack Black's performance is truly worth applauding. He's flawless as Nacho. On the whole, 'Nacho Libre' benefits from a funny script & a career best performance by its leading man. Two Thumbs Up!",Nacho Libre
16,Smells_Like_Cheese,"To be honest, I thought it was kinda stupid",3,24 October 2006,"I wasn't at all interested in seeing Nacho Libre when I first saw the trailer, but after looking at IMDb, it seemed like a decent rental. I'm also a fan of Jack Black, he's usually a good hit with movies, especially comedies, excluding Envy, I mean what the heck was with that? Anyways, Nacho Libre is a story of hits and misses that just didn't flow that well.It's about a priest who falls for a nun, but he doesn't have any money, so he grabs a bum off the street and they team up as Mexican tag team wrestlers known as ""Nacho Libre"". There is one problem, they suck! They can't win a single match, but since they are so popular with the crowds, they are paid anyways and get more shows. But when the priest's partner turns out to be a total... you know what, he goes out on his own to win against the Mexican wrestling champion! There are a few problems I have with this film, like the partner. I don't know if he was supposed to be loved eventually, but I found him to be so ignorant and rude that I just refused to get into him. The fart jokes were just too much, it's one thing when it's for one scene, but it just kept going and spoiled the joke. Not to mention, I hate saying this, believe me, but this was also too stereotypical and very offensive in my opinion. But I think this is one of those movies you'll have to judge for yourself.3/10",Nacho Libre
17,DKosty123,Espanol Jack Black,6,24 October 2006,"Jack Black is his usual absurd self in this but instead of English, he goes for the Spanish appeal. He looks patently absurd in his tights, but he does show a lot of energy in the action sequences. I think this is a notch below Jack's ""School Of Rock"" performance but the script actually makes more sense to me than School as in that one, I had to but away reality & pretend a completed idiot could teach school. Don't tell the teachers Union, but that is actually more realistic than this one now that I think about it.In this one, Jack is NACHO, who becomes El Nacho, wrestler who with Esqueleto go into taking on matches they always lose to make money to feed the orphans at the poor home where Jack works. Jack turns out to be a good guy in this film who when his identity is found out, almost has to leave his job.Jack does seem a little different in this film than the other although in the wrestling sequences he still gets to do the same type of dive he did from the music stage in School of Rock. This is not a great film, but at least it is funny & only lasts about 100 minutes so it doesn't overstay it's welcome with the viewers.The supporting acting in this is pretty much not there as it is Jack Blacks show for sure. His wrestling partner, actor Héctor Jiménez (Esqueleto) is really the person who stands out the most in support. None of the others get much script to work with.",Nacho Libre
18,Robert_duder,As dumb and useless as it looks...a complete disappointment,4,20 June 2006,"I don't know what I expected from Nacho Libre. I was not a huge fan of the enormously successful cult classic Napoleon Dynamite but I love Jack Black's comedy and I knew it would be dumb but it could still be funny. Unfortunately Nacho Libre is only one thing...BORING...flat out boring with gags and jokes that are so stale they stink and a story that is just plain boring.One thing for sure is I don't blame Jack Black. I think Black is a brilliant comedian. He can do physical comedy like nobody else, he loves to poke fun at himself, he's an average joe who just likes to act crazy and usually that's fun to watch. School of Rock was just hilarious but the story was solid. Black was equally hilarious in the very under rated High Fidelity. I think he has a great career ahead of him in comedy, maybe even drama (he was very good in King Kong.) He can be a leading man. He is the one redeemable aspect of this film. If someone else had starred...I might have walked out...and I never do. Ana de la Reguera plays Jack Blacks'...obsession I suppose?? He is a priest and she is a nun so I can't exactly say love interest because there isn't any actual romance between them. She is very placid, a little boring, bears a striking resemblance to Penelope Cruz but does little to nothing besides be eye candy in a nun's outfit. Héctor Jiménez actually does a pretty decent job as Jack Black's tag team partner Esqueleto. He does some really good physical comedy and plays a great straight man to Blacks' comedy routine but even still the story stinks so bad. There really isn't any other characters to mention.Co-writer and director Jared Hess' idea of humor is way out there and completely off kilter. His idea of funny is being as dull and stupid as you can be which seems to work for everyone who thinks Napoleon Dynamite (also his baby) was hilarious. I guess I don't find stupidity all that funny. I won't completely crap on the film. I will say I was very impressed that you could actually take your kids to this film. There wasn't a stick of bad language, or incredibly inappropriate humor, it was actually pretty family friendly...too bad it would put them to sleep. They also felt the need to throw in the even stupider fart jokes which felt as out of place as passing gas would in a church. The wrestling scenes are funny but very, very predictable and same old when it comes to stunts and funny scenes in the ring. The single ONLY funny part was Jack Black singing a song...the man is hilarious when he sings. He should have skipped this absolute STINKER and made School of Rock 2. Then again the film is doing well and likely will continue. Everyone else in the theater seemed to be laughing insanely and I thought it was just plain dumb...drier than the Mexican desert it took place in. And for ALL the reviewers and critics and people who post online saying the film is racist...I wouldn't even worry about it. It's as racist as Napoleon Dynamite was to white people. Sure it portrays Mexicans as poor and rather foolish but then it also portrays everyone in the film as poor and stupid. It's not even campy, it must have cost them 10$ to make except for Blacks' salary. Skip this one altogether and see a better comedy...or see it and prepare to have a nap. 4/10",Nacho Libre
19,MLDinTN,Not for me,2,8 January 2008,"I didn't care for this movie. I didn't find it funny. Even Jack Black couldn't make this movie entertaining. I found it boring. Jack Black plays Nacho, a worker in a monastery, who becomes a wrestler to raise money to feed the orphans and provide improvements to their lives. The wrestling scenes are not funny and neither is Black's weird accent. The side kick was OK, but that is all I liked about this movie.The hot nun adds little to this. Nacho tries to impress her but only looks silly doing it.FINAL VERDICT: Jack Black is usually good, but not in this. Don't waste your time.",Nacho Libre

I was able to buy this movie very cheap, so I checked it out. I was happy with this movie. Jack Black and Hector Jimenez did a fine job.When Libre was younger, he was assigned to be a cook at a monastery. As he got older, he was still a cook. During the nighttime hours, he would be a wrestler. He has to make sure that he would not be caught and has to win the affection of a young, new teacher.As I said before, Black did an excellent job. If you are a fan of Jack Black, you will not be disappointed. I was surprised on how Jimenez did. He is a fine young actor.However, I will say that the script needs a little working on. Some things skipped and were not explained properly.Other than that, I thought that this was a good movie. I should never listen to negative reviews because I end up liking those movies.

This predictable comedy has Jack Black's ability to achieve comic humor in the many forms, from great body language mimic the Mexican brand of movie making to the one-liners. His timing and energy push this movie forward with interest. However, even with this comic talent, the movie plods along in places and is unable to rise above the script's typical elements, except for Black's new and refreshing presence on the screen. The relationship between Black and the nun is quite entertaining and tasteful while several violent shots appears to be excessive and distract from the movie. Seven out of Ten Stars.",Nacho Libre
22,ironhorse_iv,Nacho Libra low blows audiences with stupidity.,4,19 February 2013,"I find it interesting that Hollywood would make a comedy movie about Mexico's culture with a predominately Hispanic cast, only to cast the lead role as a recognizable white Male with the joke being that he playing a Mexican. There are far more funny Latino comedians they can use, rather than casting Jack Black as the main role. Jared Hess of Napoleon Dynamite fame directs Jack Black as Ignacio, a young man who works as a cook in the Mexican monastery where he was raised. When the institution faces a financial crisis, Igancio decide that he must do God's work, by competing in a local Lucha Libra (pro-wrestling) tournament under the character of Nacho the Luchador. Donning a spandex outfit, mask, and cape, to protect his identity from getting catch by the Church. Nacho decides he can do that and enlists the aid of a local vagrant, Esqueleto (Hector Jiminez) to be his wrestling partner. Hector Jiminez is super skinny, as Jack Black is fat. Most of the jokes will be about their weights and how gross they are. A couple of fart jokes. A diarrhea joke. A ""wipe my face"" joke. He struts around in tight sweatpants and no shirt through a significant portion of the film; not a pretty sight. They begin to lose their freshness after multiply times and it becomes a tiresome joke. Kids will love it, mature adults not so much. Some funny and unfunny tasteless jokes indeed. The movie is so crude, that they even named one of the children in the monastery, 'Chancho' which means Pig due to the fact he's overweight. Chancho is the only person who knows that Ignacio is Nacho. The plot is that Igancio need the money to make better food, clearly seeing all the fat children in the monastery, I think they need less food. Nacho tries to save the monastery while trying to win the heart of a woman of the cloth, Sister Encarnacion (Ana de la Reguera) a celebrity look-a-like rip off of Penelope Cruz. What is most remarkable about this morally-bankrupt movie is its obvious impropriety of a monk constantly soliciting a nun for sex. Though it try to create humor by mocking old practices of church it, it does not condemn religion though Ignacio's sexual appetite. Still, people in religion can feel offensive to few of its jokes. This movie is based on a real priest, Rev. Sergio Gutierrez Benitez. whom ring name is Fray Tormenta (""Friar Storm"" in Spanish) and he does wrestle under the mask in Mexico to support an orphanage. He inspired characters ranging from King from Tekken, to Crasher Wake to Pokemon. This movie is not a tribute to him, as there are far better movies such as 1991, French movie L'Homme au masque d'or (The Man In The Golden Mask) starring Jean Reno. Even, Fray Tormenta appeared in the film 2007 Padre Tormenta as a priest who dons the luchador's mask and enters the ring to raise funds for the orphanage he directs was better than this movie. Nacho Libre, naively made kids' stuff, lacks such minor attributes as a decent script. The film sports an whimsy and melancholy in the first 20 minutes and continues to be somewhat a downer. The later half of the movie feels formulaic and conventional, the joyous spontaneity lost as Ignacio continues to fail and fail. Jared Hess directs the movie with the same colors & visuals as Dynamite, but fails to present properly Mexico culture. Hess perpetuating stereotypes for some sort of comic purpose in this film. The manner in which he depicts Mexicans with the bad teeth and the tacky squalor is also something that many would find offensive. Actually, the accent Jack Black used in the movie is called the bandito accent. That accent has been used for ages in Hollywood when representing Mexicans on film. It's quite a different accent from the accent from Mexicans and and a lot more different than the accent used by people from Spain. It's as different as the English accent used in Britain, Australia and the US. It's appear both racist & making fun of Mexico even if it's not the movie's intention. This movie wrestles with a lot of issues, and get pin to the count of 3, because of it.",Nacho Libre
23,Floated2,Could have been much better,3,6 May 2010,"Jack Black really isn't at all funny in this movie. It's got a few scenes which are pretty funny, but most of the jokes are played out and just not even funny. Though the facial expressions are funny (more than the one-liners) I wasn't expecting much from the storyline but what I got was even less. Some of the wrestling sequences are alright and are well-filmed, but as a whole I just didn't think this movie delivered.Some scenes are overly done intentionally to get a laugh, but in many (if not all) of these scenes they just completely miss their mark. Nacho, for some reason, has a tendency to pass gas at any opportune time (and there are many in the film). I'm sure this is an example of something that is supposed to be funny, but it just doesn't work.Also, this has to be one of the most predictable movies I have seen. It was predictable that he would end up getting that girl, predictable that he would enter the tournament, and was predictable that he would end up winning the whole thing and receive money in the end. Its been done many times before...way too predictable for me. And why was the colour that bad? i looked as if the movie was shot way before the actually screening",Nacho Libre

If you think The Three Stooges had good physical comedy about them, wait 'till you see this movie ! I wasn't such a big fan of Jack Black until I saw this movie, but he was perfect as Nacho. You wouldn't think a movie about a man who's not in such great physical shape becoming a wrestler in Mexico would make an interesting movie, but I was wrong big time. The movie surpassed all my expectation, and it was one of the best movie I saw this year. I can't go into details about what makes this movie so good because then it will spoil it for the people who's yet to see it, but I predict that this will become one of the all time classics of the comedy movie genre. If you haven't seen it yet, plan to see it soon. You won't be disappointed.",Nacho Libre
25,dfranzen70,"Godawful junk, a total disqualification",2,4 December 2006,"Jack Black is a Mexican friar who secretly is a masked wrestler, or luchador. He has the hots for a cute, pious nun and wants to help all the little orphans at his church. It's as awful as it sounds.Ignacio (Black), caught as a child by the brothers stealing materials for a wrestling costume, has worked at the church his entire life as the cook, and he's not terribly good - his specialty appears to be nachos - and he yearns to live free, to express himself, to discover wonderful things. No, wait... he doesn't yearn to do those things. He just wants to wrestle.But wait! The new nun, Sister Encarnacion (the beautiful Ana de la Reguera) doesn't like wrestling. It is violent and bad and stuff, she claims. So Ignacio doesn't mention to her that he has donned tights and a mask and wrestles on the weekends with a partner, Esqueleto (Hector Jimenez), a skeletal thief. The two make quite the pair, and they're not very good at wrestling, much like Esqueleto and thieving or Ignacio and cooking. Black probably should have been, pardon the pun, the saving grace of the film, but he's poorly cast and completely unfunny. There's hardly a laugh to be had; what chuckles one gets come from the antics of the seldom-seen orphans, chiefly Chancho. It's not as if Black isn't typically funny, that he's some sort of Serious Actor who hardly ever does funny. He's Jack Black! He's pretty much nothing but funny. Except here, where's he's everything but; he's painful to watch at times.But he's not helped by a meandering film, either. With no belly laughs, one would think the emphasis would be on sentimentality with a dash of light humor. Only you hardly ever get any of that, either, except at the very end with a predictable ending. It's so wildly predictable that you could guess it RIGHT NOW. Without having seen the movie. If this were a parody of fighter films, like Hot Shots was of fighter-pilot movies, then the deadpan deliveries might make some sense - if, of course, they were accompanied by actual jokes, even throwaway lines. Otherwise, one might make the mistake of thinking the movie was set in a more-melodramatic period, where people left their lovers by fog-dampened train and the star quarterback married his sweetheart right after scoring eleventy-five points against Big Mean Old Jerks U in the homecoming game. But it's not that, either; everyone, save perhaps the radiant de la Reguera, seems listless, sleepwalking through a dull pseudocomedy that shouldn't be mentioned again.Heck, they don't even get the wrestling part of things right, as Ignacio (wrestling as Nacho) and his various opponents do all sorts of things that would be forbidden in a true luchador match, such as a pinfall outside the ring, the removal of a mask, and so forth. I guess the gang behind this one felt they needed to include more American wrestling features, you know, to sex it up a little.About the only saving grace is de la Reguera, who, although she's given nothing with which to work, does manage to come out of it looking fine; I'm sure she'll be able to use her role as a springboard to better things, although if I were her I'd put ""Was in Jack Black film"" on my resume and hope no one asks questions.*1/2",Nacho Libre
26,meeza,Naachso are a bit salty but does have a comedic taste,7,5 September 2006,"I guess the effervescent Jack Black was the prototypical actor to play the ludicrous Lucha Libre wrestler ""Nacho Libre"". Director Jared Hess, who helmed the modern cult classic ""Napoleon Dynamite"", made the right choice in casting Black. No one could play Nacho better. Black is definitely a ""Nacho, Nacho Man"" ""he had to be the Nachoman."" However, I guess what Hess needed was bit more of that cerebral creative gas to pump up his Nacho movie. The film is too inconsistently entertaining. At times it is a wallop of a laugh-fest while at others it wrestles itself to lie flat on the floor. ""Nacho Libre"" follows a monk named Nacho who desperately wants to provide funding for the orphans he cares for in the monastery. He decides to transform himself into the bubbling alter-ego Nacho with a bubbling emaciated wresting partner named Esqueleto. Nacho also decided to dip into the Nacho physique to impress the beautiful nun, Sister Encarnacion. One thing is for sure, Nacho shows way too much carne to impress Encarnacion. Make no bones about it that Hector Jimenez as Esqueleto is one of the comedic acting charms of the year. It is very reminiscent of another Mexican actor in a Hess film. Of course, I am referring to the performance that made our wildest dreams come true, Efren Ramirez as Pedro in ""Napoleon Dynamite"". Well, that is the skinny on Jimenez's efforts. ""Nacho Libre"" is not worth jumping for joy for, but it worthy to greet it with a welcome mat. *** Average",Nacho Libre

Jack black was sickening and very unfunny as the lead, and most of the time was shirtless and sweaty, which was gross. His sidekick, whatever his name is, just yelled and screamed the whole time, which wasn't funny at all, just really annoying. In fact, if I had to describe this movie in 1 word, that's what it'd be, annoying! The slapstick was annoying, and every character was as well! The only character I liked, was the love interest for jack blacks character, she wasn't annoying, and it's amazing, I never laughed once, not once! I just rolled my eyes a whole lot instead.

Dean Martin & Jerry Lewis, When Harry Met Sally, all the way up to & including Airplane. Nacho Libre presents a new & very different style of humour. You don't get big punchlines, witty comebacks or rapid-fire dialogues. If I had to describe it, I'd say it's ""deadpan"" to an extreme. You really have to key in on subtle signals like facial expressions, odd phrases, or just situational weirdness to understand the jokes.Not expecting that, I watched this movie all the way through and only laughed twice. I kept waiting for punchlines that never came.After watching it, I came to the IMDb message board and read through the thread of ""Funniest Lines"". Sure enough, I didn't get the jokes there either, but seeing how everyone was cracking up, I realized that those lines were funny.After that, I found myself talking to people in everyday life, quoting Nacho Libre and getting big laughs. Suddenly I think I get it. I'll probably watch this film again, knowing what to expect, and I bet I'll get a few big lols out of it. Maybe even a rofl or 2.",Nacho Libre

32,winner55,always amusing,7,23 April 2007,"I'm not a fan of Jack Black; to be honest, I thought ""School of Rock"" to be pandering, absurd, and just a waste of time. And Black is one of those comic actors who's always essentially playing himself - his schtick is his personality and vice versa, a kind of comedy not to my taste.But in ""Nacho Libre"" Black doesn't play Jack Black; and his basic lack of acting talent actually enhances the character.The film is not a satire of the wrestling business in Mexico but an offbeat comment on it. It helps to understand that professional wrestling in Mexico is (or at least for a long time was) a national passion, the low budget everyman's fantasy that made the difficult poverty of Mexico a little easier to bear. (It certainly helps to have seen a couple Santo movies.) I didn't feel it was racist - Mexico has grown up somewhat in the past twenty years, meaning that Mexicans have learned to smile at themselves on occasion, so I don't think they'll be offended by this film - it certainly doesn't demean them; on the contrary, despite the foolishness of the central characters, the film is really an odd, offhanded celebration of self-respect, which is the other quality the Mexicans have struggled to acquire, especially in confrontation with the bullyboy neighbor to the North. At worst, as far as real Mexicans are concerned, the film might be too silly to rate further consideration. It is certainly consistently ridiculous, which is actually a quality in its favor - there's no effort to drop suddenly back into reality anywhere here, it's a fantasy through and through.I don't think this is a great film, by any means; but I don't feel that watching it was a total waste of time. It is not laugh-out-loud funny, but it is certainly always amusing.",Nacho Libre

34,dunmore_ego,"Lotsa Lucha, Lessa Libre",5,22 July 2006,"Apparently, wrestling IS real. A body-shaved Jack Black, squeezing his scrote into a sky-blue leotard and wrestling as a Mexican luchador by night whilst tending orphans during the day as a monk, must have sounded good on paper Greenlighting the writers and director of quirky hit Napoleon Dynamite (Jared and Jerusha Hess) would have also been a no-brainer in this industry that sees your last success as its future income. Add to the mélange writer Mike White, who penned Black's last storm-bringer, 2003's School Of Rock, and the product of all these A-Listers is - A movie where the phrase ""comedic payoff"" is as foreign as its cast.Resting on their Dynamite laurels, the writers seem so self-conscious that any portion of their innocuous dialog may find legs as schoolyard or water cooler catchphrases that no effort is expended in tightening up the lackadaisical pacing, timing, action or script itself. Like its hero, Nacho Libre lacks any kind of punch. (Although the name of Jack's and Mike's new production company hits a home run: Black and White Productions.) Set in a Mexico where everyone is greasier than is racistly possible, and where the first language is English, delivered with an English-as-a-second-language accent, Black is Ignacio, an unwilling monk who tends a poverty-stricken orphanage, with his monk superior doing a Mexican Ray Romano (i.e. being not funny). Into this orphanage comes Sister Encarnación (Ana de la Reguera, trying hard to be mistaken for Penelope Cruz), for no reason other than to give Ignacio blue balls.Obsessed with the Mexican free-style wrestling known as Lucha Libre, Ignacio enlists the aid of a street thief, Esqueleto (anorexic Héctor Jiménez - or maybe he just looks anorexic next to Black), to partner with him in small-time, underground wrestling matches, body-slamming canvas as his alter-ego, the masked and leotarded Nacho; losing matches with wild abandon, they yet make enough cash to afford fresh food for the orphanage and a pimping' lifestyle for themselves.There is a silly life-lesson attached to this aspect of making money. Encarnación tells Ignacio that fighting is only acceptable in the church's eyes if it is done for someone who needs help. Does no one appreciate that Ignacio's winnings raised the cuisine of the orphanage from feces gruel to Bennigan's Chinese Chicken Salads? Yet the movie pursues this fallacious point as avidly as it resorts to fart jokes when nothing else seems to be working.After losing all his battles - because he was supposedly fighting only for the fame - Nacho wins his last fight, ostensibly because he has re-thunk his attitude to fight for the orphans who need his help - but his spurt of winning spunk only comes when he sees Sister Encarnación enter the arena and visions of nun-pie careen his endorphins. Which effectively means: not only was he not fighting for fame, he was not even fighting for anyone who needed his help - he fights for the reason every animal on earth fights: to impress chicks. (This is, ultimately, the most noble quest of all, from an Earth ecosystem point of view - procreation. Try telling that to people who pretend they are on a ""higher spiritual plane"" than the rest of us heathen, by dressing in black smocks and white collars.) Black has still ""got it"" and there are two major belly laughs, when he unleashes his ""JB"" persona, belting out anthemic paeans in his inimitable Tenacious D idiom (complete with ""bedo-bedo-boopoduuu"" horn lines). These moments were, alas, too few to make a difference, Black meeting with the same fate as Jim Carrey in 2005's Fun With Dick and Jane: a super comedian in a role that would have better suited a non-comedian like Rob Schneider or Jason Biggs. With an accent unintentionally vacillating between Tony Montana, Shatner and Hervé Villechaize, the Jack Black we automatically laugh at was subsumed by foreign ambiguity.Speaking of foreign ambiguity, Peter Stormare is completely misused as some kind of fey oracle, an opportunity to skewer Connery's Ramirez from Highlander going wanting. All the other wrestlers are one-dimensional, most of them wearing their masks full-time to avoid any kind of humanization, especially the film's cardboard villain, Ramses (Cesar Gonzalez).Nacho's mask is ripped off in the final battle with Ramses for the same reason that all masks and helmets are removed for no apparent reason (Spider-Man, Mission to Mars, Red Planet) - so that during high anxiety, we can see his facial expressions and relate to his emotional palette. Film-makers think we have not yet caught on to this lame gambit.At movie's end, when we realize that Nacho has still not consummated his relationship with Sister Encarnación - and probably never will - so as not to send a message of monk-nun infidelity (as if that would shock a PG-13 audience - maybe for the fact that it is purely a normal heterosexual relationship involving no young boys), we can only grimace, like him, through clenched teeth and blue balls.And, like the rest of the movie, without any punchline, it simply... inoffensively... peters out...",Nacho Libre

36,pyrocitor,Jack Black as a Mexican priest/wrestler - what more need be said?,7,17 June 2006,"It would seem these days that Jack Black can do no wrong. His winning combo started with his star making turn in 2003's The School of Rock, and his popularity was barely swayed with relative misfires in Envy and Shark Tale. 2005 saw Black starring in Peter Jackson's adventure epic remake of King Kong, and proving him able to harness his trademark manic energy and channel it into a more dramatic performance than his usual goofball comedy roles. But here, Black returns to what he does best - ridiculous, forgettable and extremely funny comedy. Ignacio (Black), a cook and friar at a local orphanage has never felt like he fully fit in. In an attempt to find some sense of self, as well as to win money to provide better food for the children... and perhaps also finally win some personal glory and potentially impress fellow orphanage worker, the beautiful Sister Encarnación, Ignacio creates a larger than life wrestling persona, the dynamic Nacho, and enters the ring as a Luchador. It's safe to say that the movie revolves around Black and his genius comedic talents, but it is also quite the quality mix of modern comedic talents - Jared Hess, director of last year's cult hit Napoleon Dynamite, brings a similar sense of quirky, offbeat and understated humour to play here, as does scriptwriter Mike White, who also penned School of Rock and Orange County, both starring Jack Black. The odd mix between the three different styles of humour seems to work surprisingly well, and Nacho comes to play as an oddball, quirky yet very funny comedy. It's just a bit disappointing Hess and White found it necessary to include some very childish fart jokes, which seem very out of place. Nacho also comes across as surprisingly unmemorable, with few lines as endlessly quotable as Napoleon Dynamite, but what Napoleon lacked was the power of Jack Black, who seems able to evoke roars of laughter from his audience just from a facial expression or jerk of his head. Black also receives able support from the quirky and very funny ""sidekick"" role of his fellow wrestler, ""Elsqueleto"", an odd looking fellow with a grotesque smile and memorable scream, and Nacho's ""love"" interest, Sister Encarnación, who has a very limited role in the story but makes good use of her screen time and shallow character. Also look for a cameo from Swedish character actor Peter Stormare as a sage gypsy who helps Nacho on his quest to become the world's greatest fighter. All in all, Nacho Libre seems the perfect prescription for a night of summer movie entertainment. It may not be terribly memorable and don't search for any profound deeper meanings, but Nacho is a return to form for Jack Black in the field of offbeat comedy, which makes it a must see for fans of his in itself. Be warned: expect to use the term ""stretchy pants"" for quite some time afterwards.-7/10",Nacho Libre
37,Sirus_the_Virus,Disappointing,2,31 July 2009,"Jack Black is usually funny in his films. Besides his cocaine addicting role in Tropic Thunder.

I must say that the film was a huge disappointment. i didn't want to see it, it was between The Da Vinci Code and this, and I saw this. I have to say... I only found one part funny. That was where Nacho(Jack Black) runs away. His best friend comes and finds him. Nacho asks him how he found him, and his friend says that he didn't go very far. Because Nacho ran away right next to the town. Nacho Libre is a forgettable film. I don't remember it in any way at all. All that I remember is that I didn't like it... the movie was pretty retarded.

It was like ""LOOK HOW CLEVER I AM! HA HA! Aren't I FUNNY??""

40,lambiepie-2,Draws you in kinda 'cute'...,7,13 July 2008,"When Nacho Libre first arrived in the theaters, I didn't have a big interest in seeing it. As much as I like Jack Black, I couldn't wrap myself around the marketing campaign enough to get me in the theaters to watch this. But once it came out on DVD, I rented it, watched it twice. Why? Nacho Libre has a 50's/60's type comedy wrapped up in an independent Mexico/Spanish film quality. After repeated viewings, it grows on you and becomes kinda ...cute.What you have is an ""out of the way"" orphanage run by Fathers who have become the bottom of the barrel complacent. When one of their orphans now all grown up becoming a ""priest to be"" happens to see a wrestler being showered with attention, he visions an opportunity two fold - he himself wishes to be showered with attention, which is not a true path for a priest and also, a way to help the orphanage out of its complacency - with better food & needed transportation to get the orphans on trips. Add in a young, smart, pretty nun who captures the attention of him and another priest, and there begins the conflicts.Jack Black plays the ""preist to be"" with higher aspirations to help his orphanage well in a very independent movie type vein. But independent film as it was back in the day from Mexico. The facial expressions of the actors, the pauses, etc. all are reminiscent and nostalgic of these 1950/1960 - even early 70's independent films and Nacho Libre catches them well. The ""independent"" wrestling matches too are pretty reminiscent of those times. While there is a bit of violence with the wrestling, there is no ""sex"" and the tale unfolds just as it would in family film fare.Why is this film getting mixed reviews? I guess its all in how you see it, and what is attracting you. Obviously this is not a 'drop dead slapstick' Jack Black comedy, but to me a tip of the hat to independent film of old, with some inspiration of real people we would have never know about before behind it.",Nacho Libre

42,Beta_Gallinger,"Didn't like it the first time, but it grew on me with a second viewing",7,21 June 2008,"I heard about this film while it was in theatres. The fact that it was from the creators of ""Napoleon Dynamite"" and starred Jack Black were two good reasons for me to see it, and I was probably thinking about going to see it in the theatre, but it never happened. I finally saw it on the small screen very late in 2006, but despite being a fan of ""Napoleon Dynamite"" and Jack Black, I found the film to be pretty much average and forgettable, so I didn't regret not seeing it on the big screen. Nearly a year and a half later, however, I've seen it again, and this time, it was surprisingly better.Ignacio is a man who was raised as an orphan in a monastery in Mexico, and now works there as the cook. Unfortunately, the monastery is in a poor financial state, so the food he makes is terrible! When a nun named Sister Encarnación moves into the monastery, Ignacio develops a crush on her. To save the monastery, be able to start feeding the orphans well, and impress Sister Encarnación, he goes out to make money, and plans to achieve his long-term ambition and become a wrestler. He convinces a street thief named Steven to join him as his sidekick, and together, they start participating in local wrestling matches, Ignacio under the name, ""Nacho Libre"" and Steven under the name, ""Esqueleto"". Even though Steven tends to take rough beatings in the ring, and the pair don't tend to win matches at first, they still make money, enough for Ignacio to feed the orphans properly. The problem is, where he comes from, wrestling is considered a sin.""Napoleon Dynamite"" doesn't have much of a plot, but due to all the laughs I found in it, I can't complain much. This follow-up from director/co-writer Jared Hess and his wife and co-writer Jerusha Hess (along with Mike White this time) isn't quite as funny as its predecessor (though I definitely found it funnier the second time than I did the first). Here, we have the main character farting occasionally, and fart jokes are a rather tiresome cliché in comedy these days that mustn't take much talent to come up with! Fortunately, there aren't a lot of those in this particular movie, though I also didn't care much for certain other gags, such as Nacho rubbing excrement in Esqueleto's face. However, it certainly still is funny at times, even though generally not hilarious. Jack Black often provides laughs, and I'm sure many other fans of his would agree. Maybe none of the gags can match some of the ones in ND, but for fans of Jack Black and slapstick, it should have its funny moments. Also, unlike its predecessor, this film is touching at times. Jack Black plays a silly but likable and caring character, which is definitely a highlight. The wrestling scenes add a bit of suspense to the story. In other words, unlike ND, it's not all about the laughs.This certainly isn't the most consistent comedy I've ever seen, with some unnecessary moments (like the fart jokes), which the movie probably would have been better without, but overall, it's still reasonably funny film with a good story. It's much better than the dreadful ""Epic Movie"", that's for sure! The reason I mention that is because ""Nacho Libre"" is one of the films ""spoofed"" in that crime against humanity! Also, Héctor Jiménez, who plays Esqueleto in this film, soon went on to play Mr. Tumnus in ""Epic Movie"" afterwards! Anyway, if you want lighthearted silliness, along with a bit of action and some fairly touching moments, this second feature-length film from the creators of ""Napoleon Dynamite"" is probably worth checking out, especially if you're a Jack Black fan. Even if you're not impressed the first time, it might improve with another viewing!",Nacho Libre
43,CitizenCaine,Nacho Cinco,5,13 December 2008,"Jack Black is not exactly one of the great or even good comic actors of our time. That said, Black is much better when he's more subdued, as in Orange County, Shallow Hal, or School of Rock. Here in Nacho Libre, he plays a layman who gets stuck cooking for monks in the Mexican desert? And somehow he's a friar? Yeesh! Oh, and ah, the monks are taking care of poor Mexican kids who speak better English than most students in public schools. Enter a nun who comes off as Sister Holy Innocent and adds almost nothing to the film. Never mind the goofy plot; Jared Hess tries to navigate through this mess as best as he can, which means lots of scenes with Jack Black trying to make with the funny and falling flat on his ass or back, literally. The paper-thin story has Black teaming up with a Mexican street punk with bad teeth to form a tag team combination worthy of fighting luchadores on the Mexican fake-wrestling circuit. He hopes to earn enough money to serve better food to the poor Mexican orphans who are tired of gruel, Mexican style, topped with tortilla chips. Along the way, Black hopes to impress Sister Holy Innocent enough to seriously challenge her vows. Black performs stunts, sings, wrestles, and speaks with an ever-changing accent throughout the film in hopes of entertaining us. However, the film is full of a lot of set-ups that never pay off, like with the obese girl interested in Hector Jimenez. It goes nowhere and generates nary a chuckle. After Napoleon Dynamite, an over-rated sensation itself, Nacho Libre is somewhat of a disappointment. ** of 4 stars.",Nacho Libre

For your wrestling entertainment, I introduce to you the Lord's Luchador, the Mauling Monk, the Orphanator! Put your hands together for Naaaacho Liiiibbbbre! Jack Black (KING KONG) returns as another obsessive character in Jared Hess' latest cinematic offering, NACHO LIBRE. Most will remember Hess for his stunning direction of NAPOLEON DYNAMITE. Here he gets a bit more money for production and gives us a hilarious tale of a Mexican monk who's early dreams of becoming a luchador (wrestler) come to fruition later in life.Jack Black plays Nacho, a cook at an orphanage/monastery where his talents as a chef come into question daily. But the one thing Nacho yearns for is to become a professional wrestler. His contact sports passions are reignited by the arrival of a beautiful nun named Sister Encarnacion (Ana de la Reguera (LADIES NIGHT), and by a wily thief named Esqueleto (SUPERVIVENCIA), a streetwise thug with bizarre moves. Esqueleto and Nacho team up and eventual take to the ring, only to be beaten time and again, but still making money. But making money isn't enough for Nacho (""I want to win!""). Vanity gets the better of Nacho and he tries everything to achieve his goal of becoming a winner, including finding a shaman who gives him sketchy advice regarding eagle eggs.Finally Nacho learns that winning comes from within and uses his ""inner"" strength to make his way to the top.Silliness occasionally racks Nacho Libre, but it is saved by Jack Black's incredible physical comedy. Not since SCHOOL OF ROCK has he been so well cast. The training scenes alone are worth the price of the rental (Cow dung to the face? A wasps nest to the head? Shooting Esqueleto with a blunted arrow?) When Nacho tries to court Sister Encarnacion, the comedy is further ratcheted up as Jack Black uses his butt-muscle tone in a nut cracking fashion! Napoleon Dynamite fans will flock to Hess' latest film, and will probably be amazed at what he accomplished with a little more cash and a few Hollywood well-known actors.",Nacho Libre
45,cultfilmfan,Nacho Libre,8,26 June 2006,"Nacho Libre takes place in Mexico and is about a man named Nacho who works at a religious orphanage as the cook. The orphanage has no fresh ingredients for food, so the food that Nacho cooks is terrible. Having always been a fan of Mexican wrestling, Nacho meets a young man named Esqueleto who agrees to train with him and be a wrestling team together. The two of them never seem to win any of their fights, but they get paid even if they don't win, so they continue to do this, but must keep it a secret because the orphanage considers wrestling wrong. Also when a new nun named Sister Encarnacion comes to the orphanage Nacho falls in love with her and wants to impress her, but also must keep the wrestling a secret from her as well. Nacho Libre has good direction, a good script and a good comedic performance by Jack Black (who plays Nacho) as well as a good supporting cast. I was really surprised how much I liked Nacho Libre. I found it to be an entertaining movie and it had a lot of offbeat characters and situations which I really liked. This is a movie that is really different than a lot of the other summer movies that are coming out right now and that is one reason I liked this movie. It's humour, characters and situations all use a bizarre and original type of humour that I feel works well and it helps make the movie more unique and special than some of the other comedies out there. I also liked the film's story and there are some amusing parts as well as some sweet and touching moments that go along with this story. A lot of people said that this movie didn't look too good after they saw the trailers and I'm sure to a lot of people the movie does look silly and juvenile, but I think if you like odd humour and can appreciate a movie like Napoleon Dynamite (which is also by the same director here and co-writers) which had a similar sense of style and humour than you should be able to appreciate this film as well. This type of humour isn't for everyone which probably leads to some of the negative reviews you might have read for the film, but I was thoroughly entertained by this film and I think it will appeal to both adults and kids as a fun movie for everyone. With it's fun and well paced story and off the wall humour I definitely recommend Nacho Libre to fans of that type of humour and of similar movies like the film Napoleon Dynamite.",Nacho Libre
46,spookyrat1,Signature Move!,6,20 June 2020,"I guess you either like Jack Black or don't. I've never taken to him as a tough guy leading man (King Kong, hopelessly miscast), or a rom-com heart throb ( The Holiday, seriously?). He's most at home in stuff such as Nacho Libre; in your face, physical comedy with a touch of heart and soul. Having said that, I'm amazed that Nacho Libre is actually based on a true story of a real-life Mexican Catholic priest who had a 23-year career as a masked luchador and competed in order to support the orphanage he directed. Just seems fittingly bizarre.Black plays lowly regarded monk/cook Ignacio who dreams of becoming a luchador, primarily to improve the lot of the children he cares deeply for, at the same poor Mexican orphanage where he grew up. He'd also like to impress the very foxy Sister Encarnacion, a nun who teaches at the orphanage. After meeting homeless guy Steve in the back streets of the local township, they decide to take the plunge and join up as tag team partners in a local competition, with Ignacio, adopting the masked guise of wrestler Nacho Libre, to try to avoid sanctioning from monastery senior monks, who see professional wrestling as a sin of vanity.I'm the first to admit that a lot of the Black humour is pretty school yard basic. Sophistication and Jack Black don't go hand in hand. However Nacho Libre has 3 really strong positives going for it.The very well choreographed wrestling bouts and array of wrestling characters are really funny. I defy any viewers to not at least get some solid giggling going, watching them. Steven, Ignacio's usually hapless sidekick, who wrestles under the alias of Esquelet played by Hector Jimenez, is a wonderful addition to the cast and with his eternal hang dog facial expression, comes close to stealing every scene he's in. And finally, the (surprisingly) tasteful, budding romance between Ignacio and Sister Encarnacion played by the gorgeous Ana de la Reguera, gives the movie a solid emotional core.Nacho Libre is undeniably quirky and silly in large portions of screen time throughout. But even if you don't always find this type of goofy humour always agreeable it is still a sweet movie with a universal message about caring for others. And the sight of Jack Black clad in tight wrestling regalia is an image not easily forgotten.",Nacho Libre
47,Rogue-32,Black and White and Jared all over,8,23 June 2006,"If you are familiar with my reviews, you know I'm a huge Mike White fan and you also know that Jared Hess' Napoleon Dynamite is aces in my book. And it's no news to anyone on the planet that Jack Black ain't no slouch either. Put them all together, throw in some adorable orphans, a career-confused monk, a sexy nun, some funny face masks, a wrestling ring or two, some stretchy pants and the country of Mexico, and you've got Nacho Libre. This is one of those movies, like Napoleon Dynamite, that you either get or you don't. You either buy into the offbeat-ness of the premise, the skewed-ness of the characters and the thoroughly charming and subversively sure-footed execution thereof, or you don't. While this film is a bit more mainstream than ND, and Jon Heder (whose characterization elevated that film to near-mythic status) is nowhere to be seen, Nacho Libre still manages to succeed on its own terms, bent and twisted - but always good-hearted - as they are. The thing I loved the most about the film is its originality. Not the plot per se, which is yer basic 'let's put on a show and save the (fill in the blank)'. Rather, it's the way the plot is executed that makes this such a special affair.Of course I could not imagine for a second that Jack Black was Mexican (or even half Mexican and half Scandanavian), but that's not really the point, I decided by the end of the film (great closing credits, by the way, with that song that Black sings, the one he wrote with Hess and White - really funny lyrics). This is supposed to be a gentle satire, not a searingly realistic art film, and on its own terms, it works brilliantly, creating its own pace, its own reality, its own world which, by the end of the movie, thoroughly won me over. Even the silly outfit that Black's character wears began looking nearly mythic (there's that word again) by the endearing climax. Filmed entirely south of the border, with a vast amount of Mexican crew members, this film can hardly be called racist - it's not like Hess & Co filmed in Boise and tried to pass it off as Mexico, for cryin' out loud. And remember, a movie isn't merely what you see on screen, it's also what you DON'T see; so many stereotypical elements that could have been included and pathetically run into the ground are LEFT OUT - these had to be conscious choices on the parts of the film makers. Nacho Libre has its heart in the right place, without being sappy about it, and that utterly deranged smile of Black's in the final scene - where's he's gotten the glory, the gold and the girl - is more than thoroughly well-earned.",Nacho Libre
48,Danusha_Goska,Three Stooges Does School of Rock in Mexico,4,19 June 2006,"""Nacho Libre"" relies for its entertainment value on the sight of Jack Black's fat, naked belly as he is beaten up on by much larger, more muscular men.There's also lots of ""humor"" milked from Mexicans. Boy, Mexicans are funny. They are either really fat, or really skinny, or really horny, ugly women. They all talk funny. Mexicans! If Jack Black's fat belly and jokes about Mexicans floats your boat, you will love this movie.For the rest of us? It's kind of a bore, really.My mind kept wandering: ""Boy, this is a campy movie. What a weird, loud soundtrack. How are all these jokes about Mexicans going to go down during our inflamed immigration debate? Are there people out there who will find this funny? Can't anybody ever be on screen except Jack Black in a movie starring Jack Black? Are there really people who will find the sight of his naked, fat belly so very funny that they want to stare at it for 90 minutes?""

51,EijnarAmadeus,One of Jack Black's weakest movies.,4,28 December 2006,"Sadly Nacho Libre doesn't become that great, the whole idea could have been a nonstop laugh-machine but instead Nacho Libre finds a way of seeming ultimately boring. Off course any comedy featuring Jack Black creates some amusing moments in which most of them are inside the ring, as soon as we step out of the ring the movie seems unfocused and empty for ideas, disappointing. Nacho Libre doesn't try being morally correct or very family-friendly, and thats a fine relief because it lets Jack Black be Jack Black. The romance-scenes between Black and the new non-in-town is actually surprisingly charming, and Jack Black's companion in the ring is also a fine affair, leaving there no doubt that Jack Black tries making this movie more funny than it is. Nacho Libre could have become Black's finest installment to date, but it falls short and far behind his comedy-genius of School of Rock.",Nacho Libre
52,oneloveall,Jared Hess + Jack Black = Comedic integrity,8,19 December 2006,"Though this silly, lighthearted comedy was laughed off by many as juvenile fare, beneath the surface of this Mexican wrestling spoof lies a wholly original, uniquely charming, even humbly visionary tale that sees an evolution for Napolean Dynamite's breakout director Jared Hess. The off-kilter pace that became tremendously popular with that surprise hit now receives a more refined, more calibrated treatment, proving that the massive cult hit was indeed justified. Whereas Napolean felt uneven, at times unfocused, ultimately wearing it's quirk like a badge of honor, Nacho takes all the eccentric qualities inherent with Hess and tunes them to a weirdly fulfilled whole. Of course this movie would not have been half as impressionable had it not been for the comedic talents of Mr. Jack Black. Also exercising atypically unique restraint for a comedic film, Black paints the memorable caricature of confused spiritual wrestler in subtle washes of joy, allowing his usual overly-obnoxious antics to take a back seat for some of his more perceptive comedic ramblings. While his Mexican accent can clearly be seen veering all over the place, it is all in the spirit of this playful farce. The laughs may not come every second, but the cleverness and stylistic triumph stay sealed throughout. What also helps make the movie work so well is how everything is so entrenched in little known Mexican wrestling/religious culture, so that every scene radiates such unique warmth. While this admirable loyalty to source material makes for one of the more unique comedies of the year, perhaps it is that very loyalty that also helped alienate many moviegoers, seemingly perplexed by the amount of effort given to cover such a niche demographic. It is true, perhaps if you are of Spanish decent, lived in Mexico, or follow old school ""Luchador"" wrestling this might be more appealing, but given the small but hardcore following this movie has already amassed, I'd say it's safe to bet that anyone with an open mind for comedy would immediately be drawn to repeated viewings of this extremely independent release.",Nacho Libre
53,DonFishies,Needs a lot more laughs than it has,3,28 December 2006,"I watched Nacho Libre because it looked amusing. I had my doubts of course, as the reviews were virtually bad, director Jared Hess' Napoleon Dynamite is one of the worst films I have ever had the displeasure of viewing, and I really do not love many of Jack Black's performances (save for High Fidelity and King Kong). It is with heavy disdain that I must say that the reviewers were right.Ignacio (Black) is a Friar at a local Mexican orphanage. He wants to be a man of faith, but his fellow Friars think of him as something of a joke (I wonder why?). He works at as a cook, and despite wanting to give the children better food, he is unable to give anything but the regular disgusting meal. But Ignacio seems to have a thing for wrestling, and after seeing an ad asking for amateur wrestlers, decides to try it out with a local thief, Esqueleto (Héctor Jiménez). Throw in a bit of a love interest in new teacher/nun Encarnación (Ana de la Reguera), and you have the basic set-up of the film.It may sound funny on paper, with Black playing another clueless idiot of a character, but the results are much less than that. There are a few snickers here and there, but never is there a single thing that struck me as laugh out loud funny. Black has an intoxicating presence on screen, but usually lacks the acting chops to back it up. Jiménez is much funnier than Black, but he never comes to any full realization with his character. Reguera looks gorgeous, but does basically nothing throughout the entirety of the film (Peter Stormare's tiny cameo does even less even with a mention in the opening credits), and with the exception of a ""lion-esque"" wrestling duo, no one else really stands out as much of anything in this production. They just go through the motions with the screenplay, and collect their cheque. There is no heart or soul in this picture, and it shows in the fact that no one even wants to try, they just want to swing by and pray for the best.The main problem here is Black himself. This is not, and probably never should have been thought of, as a character for him to portray on screen. He just does not have it in him to play this doofus. His character is clearly set-up to be absolutely hilarious, but he is just lifeless and boring. Hell, his Mexican accent does not even stay Mexican throughout the entirety of his dialogue. Much too often does Black's normal American voice creep in, and give the audience a dose of who this guy really is. Another issue is in the fact that we never really understand what Ignacio's fascination with wrestling is to start with, just that he likes it and wants to live the life. The movie is short as it is, what is another minute and a half of explanation describing why he likes the sport so much, and strives to want to participate in it? Is it too boring of an ideal to give to an audience who probably should know better than to watch a movie like this in the first place? Can Black even handle any more dialogue with his disappearing/reoccurring accent? The story itself is not too bad, although it becomes heavily repetitive and predictable as it goes along. The jokes come few and far between, and I can only hope this is intentional. It is bad enough that the few jokes that do appear are only worth a small snicker, but if there were actual jokes in the middle of these lulls and they just fell far too flat for anyone's tastes, than that would only continue to perpetuate this film's badness. It works in many ways better than Napoleon, but in other's, it feels like the exact same picture, only with more direction on the story and not just the main character's goofy quotes that are increasingly less funny every time you hear them.Another jarring thing, and a bit of a surprise for me, was the blatant CGI. There are a small handful of sequences within the film that use special effects, but the ones that do stand out like a sore thumb. They look blatantly fake (which is a no-no in any film with any form of special effects), and they look like they belong to the wrong movie. Seeing Ignacio get whacked by a bull is funny, but seeing Ignacio go up and fall back down in complete CGI form and not a more seamless CG-created version of Black is just disrespectful for the medium. In an age where a giant ape can look photo-realistic and epic battles are being fought by millions of fake machines, ancient beasts and human beings without looking any different than the historical representations of any war, crappy CGI just does not cut it anymore. It needs to look realistic, no matter how small the shot. And here, it just looks silly and awkward.Even with the problems, the visuals are all in check and very vibrant in their use. I love the red on blue outfit that Ignacio wears when he is Nacho, and I was really digging how realistic the villages and costumes the characters were wearing. I have never been to Mexico, but from what I know and imagine of it, this is what I am thinking. So the film gets some props for that at least.On the whole, Nacho Libre is just one of those movies that may make a funny premise and a great trailer, but just ends up being DOA when it actually starts playing. A better script and much stronger acting could have helped this film become something actually worthwhile. But instead, it is just Napoleon Dynamite-lite. And that movie was not all too great to start with.3/10.",Nacho Libre

Can't really imagine Nacho being somebody else.The movie is easy to watch with a basic storyline added with dry humors and lots of action.

57,johnnymonsarrat,"Jon Monsarrat review: disappointing, not another Napolean Dynamite",4,22 June 2006,"I loved Napolean Dynamite but unfortunately Nacho Libre didn't add up. There are many ways in which Nacho Libre could have entertained.It could have involved some good action, and great wrestling students. It didn't.It could have had a romance plot with real chemistry. It didn't. The actor playing the nun wasn't given much to do except respond, and played her character too straight. And without giving anything away I'll just say the ending didn't resolve the final question.It could have been a good parody, but the film didn't seem to have anything intelligent to say about society or religion or even wrestling. Also a good parody still needs to have a believable plot line to capture the interest of the viewers. The characterization was too thin for this in Nacho Libre. For example, when two characters fight but then decide to work together, it falls flat.It could have been funny. Unfortunately, the comedy was mainly physical humor and fart jokes. There were a few laughs but they were sparse.From there it got worse. There was something wrong with the cinematography. The scene changes and edits were sometimes jarring. The emotional tone from one scene to another often didn't fit. It's like the actors would cry in one scene and be happy in the next (but more subtle). Possibly the film was heavily edited.The acting was fairly poor, unfortunately, I'm sad to say Jack Black himself, since I have enjoyed him in other films. There are three times when his character has to notice something out of the corner of his eye and it popped me out of the suspension of disbelief every time.",Nacho Libre

You like them or you don't. The people that like Black in the comedies where he can make his funny faces and use his strange singing voice will probably like this film. Others will probably not like it. Personally I didn't know Black at all until I saw School of Rock and I love that one. While this one doesn't come close to that I still find it very funny - it has a couple hilarious sequences in it.All in all the film adds a number of very good bits to a number of good bits to a number of mediocre bits and the combination works well enough - easy to watch, easy to forget.

'Napoleon Dynamite'. Critics gave 'Napoleon Dynamite' undeserved scathing reviews calling it tacky and boring, but I couldn't see why. 'Napoleon Dynamite' was one of the funniest films of 2004, if you just sat back and let it be. I enjoy the Jared and Jerusha Hess' off-beat strange sense of humor that almost all of us can relate to. It's as dry as it gets, and so is their latest feature, 'Nacho Libre'. Critics hated 'Nacho Libre ' also. I personally really liked the film and laughed consistently through-out the entire film. 'Nacho Libre' isn't anything brilliant, perhaps not even ""good"" film-making, but it is a very enjoyable way to kill 2 hours.Jack Black playing yet another off-the-wall character is the Spanish Orphanage priest, Ignacio, or Nacho, for short. Ignacio is a fan of Mexican wrestling and it has always been his dream to become a real wrestler, but his religion and parish forbids it. To earn money for the orphans and to impress the new nun working at the orphanage (Ana de la Reguera), Nacho and a street bum, Esquelto (Hector Jimenez) team up to kick butt and beat wrestling champion Ramses in the wrestling tournament.The plot is outrageous and even more so is everything else, but if you just sit back and check your brain at the door, you'll probably enjoy 'Nacho Libre', a lot. It's not a good film and it's definitely under the category of a 'guilty-pleasure', but that can't stop me from giving this movie a deserved thumbs up it hasn't been getting from the majority of film critics. Jack Black is a riot in his role, and so is his sidekick played by Hector Jimenez whose body-language is hysterical. The rest of the cast is filled with excluding Ana de la Reguera and a small cameo from Fargo's Peter Stormare, the cast is filled with unknowns, whom I've never seen a film prior to this, or at least I don't remember seeing them in any film before this.If you are in the mood for some ridiculously stupid fun, go see 'Nacho Libre' but if you are looking for something else, avoid this movie like the plague.

61,CinematicInceptions,Entertaining though strange,8,17 August 2014,"Of the four movies I have seen Jack Black in, I find this to be his best performance. The role was definitely written for him and you can see some parallels like his situation with Encarnancion in the storyline to those of School of Rock and Guliver's Travels. His humor is more varied in this than in School of Rock. I could do without the wrestling, though some might find humor and entertainment in it. I like the sidekick of Eskeleto and Ignacio's orphan friend Chancho. The lines of this movie, and especially their delivery, I think make it as good as it is. Other areas of humor that I find good are things like the progression of the food Ignacio serves and the party for Ramses that he goes to and the eagle egg scene. Its something that's good to watch with a big group of people, but I don't think it would top many people's lists. It isn't very similar to the aforementioned Black pictures, so it isn't worth seeing just for the actor. But if you like quotable movies, you'll enjoy this. It's kind of an underdog story, but not in an annoying way like lots of sports movies. The character of Ignacio is pretty good, because he's kind of caught in life that he's not cut out for. It really proves that not many people are meant for religious life and that religious people can be far from perfect. One of the best aspects of the movie is the little background song that they use. To poke holes in it, I might say that it was a poor portrayal of Mexican society, not that I really know anything about it. Its not exactly done crudely, but you can tell that the producers had a rather low budget to work with from the weird choreography of the wrestling scenes. I think it was done well enough, so the only reason that someone might not like this movie is if they prefer a different type of humor, or if you're like me and find the wrestling somewhat distasteful.

63,HEFILM,has some charm can seem forced,6,29 June 2006,"This is, in a way, a bit too slick for it's own good, being essentially a parody of South of the Border Masked wrestling hero movies. It plays it just straight enough to be a bit tedious and there are cartoony sound FX that clutter up the start of the film in a way that makes you worried until the charms help make up for it.The problem is the comedy is either really obvious--those sound FX, or the parody so muted that it sort of strides along at middle speed never gaining speed or laughs while always being a bit diverting.But it's sort of seedy in a way that seems kind of true to life and part of the real world, rather than taking place in the fake sets and lovable cheapness of real Masked wrestling movies. And can you parody something that's goofy to begin with? Jack Black shows his willingness to look fat and silly at his own expense, this helps you route for him to win the day, and come on this is a comedy that plays it safe to the definition of comedy so the story certainly, aside from quirky moments, plays it really by the numbers. Regardless, and the musical theme song for Black's character helps this, you are satisfied, even touched, by the way things turn out even though you know that's exactly how they will turn out pretty much from the start.Too bad they didn't play it a little more wild and loose with reality, or give the story some edge. Still sort of a risky movie for Black to agree to make,and maybe the type that can only be made at the height of an actors popularity when they can make anything they want. Though one hopes Black doesn't go the career and life path of John Belushi and Chris Farley, and to a lesser extent John Candy, with films that are essentially watch-the-fat-guy-be-abused-and-look-gross, type affairs.Whatever you may expect, don't expect a laugh a second gross out comedy. That's not where the movie's head and heart are at. If you look at it that way you may well get the most out of it. Both a worthwhile little film and one that should have been better. Forget the forced advertizements and sit down and give it a chance and you won't feel you totally wasted your time. The too few quirky moments may stick with you after you forget the cliché elements that drag it down. Odd, downright ugly looking supporting characters help out in this regard.

64,TheAll-SeeingI,"Great Comedy, And Attractively Unusual",8,8 October 2019,"The comic timing of ""Nacho Libre"" directly evokes its lineage from Napoleon Dynamite: Knowingly off-kilter in its proud awkwardness, and bolstered here by Jack Black's terrific physical comedy. You can imagine Napoleon Dynamite sitting in the theater and watching ""Nacho Libre,"" and feeling better understood by the world.Black's character Ignacio (""Nacho"") provides for orphans in his role as friar at a monastery in Mexico. But he dreams of becoming a great wrestler -- this despite his lack of prerequisite skill. Such a fun premise and set-up.Throughout, ""Nacho Libre"" isn't so much hardcore slapstick as it is its own endearingly awkward bird. It's a little bit of a joy, and a deceptively unusual major studio film -- particularly in an era in which major studios can often steer clear of the unusual for fear of box office repercussions.

Black plays a junior monk in the orphanage in which his character himself was brought up, longing to make it big as a wrestler. The whole thing is as preposterous as a Roland Emmerich movie, but here there are also a lot of laughs, interspersed with some wince-inducing wrestling scenes, which won't be to everyone's taste, but which I nonetheless enjoyed.The cast play it straight to good effect, with Hector Jiminez contributing a particularly hilarious turn as the hero's sidekick. I suppose the politically correct ought to be advised to steer clear, but I'd rather they developed a sense of humour and went along, if nothing else for the costumes, which are very, very funny.

68,diac228,"Silly, campy, and a lot of fun; Jack Black leads the way as Nacho Libre is gleeful family fun",8,13 November 2006,"Napoleon Dynamite stands as one of the most overrated disasters ever put to the big screen. That being said, the Hess couple gets it right the second time around with Nacho Libre. With a nice message, plenty of fun gags, a plot that actually contains some content, and laughs throughout, this Nick flick stands as one of the better efforts to contain the Nickelodeon name (even though in the trailers its not really that present). Jack Black more than steals the show as the main character, and a charming supporting cast helps makes this film an enjoyable one for kids and adults.What makes Napoleon Dynamite such a massive cult hit is the type of humor Jared Hess and the gang use in their movies. Their brand of humor, which is very dry, makes it a whether-you-love-it-or-hate-it kind of humor, one that can be compared to that of Woody Allen. While in Dynamite all there was in the 90 minutes was dry humor, Nacho Libre mixes dry humor with some slapstick comedy, extremely silly dialogue, and some hilarious Spanish jokes. We get a bit more variety here.In Nacho Libre, we follow a man who cooks for kids in a church, but wants to live the glamorous life of a wrestler as well. At first he was fighting to earn some money for the orphans he takes care of, but little by little the life of fame consumes him, casting a smokescreen over what is really important in his life; the kids, the beautiful nun (Played by the beautiful Ana De La Reguera), and the church he lives in. Can he live a double life without sinning and angering God or will he be forced to choose one life over the other? Jack Black steals and runs this show as his performance as the main character is easily the best in the movie. Carrying a silly grin on his face and willing to bend over backwards to get a laugh (like a fat Jim Carrey), the biggest laughs come from him. Almost as funny as Black is the hilarious Héctor Jiménez, who wears a crooked smile but also carries a dosage of physical humor that helps this movie; he would have been perfect for the role of Pedro in Napoleon Dynamite. Enrique Muñoz as Senor Ramon was awesome, its unfortunate he didn't get much screen time.With plenty of goofy action, this is just as much a kid's flick as an adult flick; there isn't much balance in terms of humor. Yet, this will totally appeal to the fans of deadpan, dry, and Simpsons-like humor. This should also appeal to the Napoleon Dynamite fans as well. Unfortunately though, the direction from Jared Hess still needs work. Some shots are totally random and way out-there, and utterly pointless. Sometimes, Hess makes some shots of people looking at the camera take way too long. There aren't long shots of the landscape, just incredibly long Andy Warhol-like shots of the actors and actresses themselves, and makes the movie 10 minutes longer than it should be. Last but not least, he should try to stay away from the stereotypical material of his work; that kind of humor wears out really thin, unless you are Mel Brooks.Bottom Line: Hess' second effort is much better than his first in every aspect whatsoever, but while his writing and comical substance excels, his directing still needs a bit of work. It's a silly premise done well thanks to the cast, and especially thanks to Jack Black. Only Black can make a scene about people eating toast and a scene about a man serving salad hysterical. Plenty of laughs, but don't expect Oscar-worthy stuff. Its great for the whole family, its Nacho Libre!",Nacho Libre

The story follows a Mexican Priest by the name of Nacho who attempts to wrestle in the local towns arena to earn money for the orphanage he lives at. Along with his partner Esqueleto, Nacho losses every match but earns money as he does it, brining happiness to the orphans.It sounds like a fairly decent idea for a family film. However, the filmmakers are able to bend and twist the characters into such stupidity that nothing makes sense by the end. Jack Black is a good entertainer, I'll give him that but he is just too stupid to be taken at all serious. Some may say I'm being ridiculous because I'm talking about a comedy film. I know it is a comedy, what I'm saying is that Nacho is just to unbelievable and stupid to cause many laughs. Some scenes are pretty funny, especially near the beginning but by the end, it is just so ridiculous that I could only sit in my seat stunned and muttering to myself ""What was Paramount thinking?"" Kids may like the stupid antics of Jack Black, he's proved his ability to act with King Kong but doing this film was a serious set back.

Jack Black and Ana de la Reguera were good in the movie and the script had lots of raw material to work with but the execution was really bad.

76,Thrashman88,Offbeat and entertaining Parody,7,12 November 2006,"""NACHO LIBRE"" is an entertaining parody of a beloved Mexican cult sport: wrestling. Jack Black plays Ignacio, an orphan from a Scandinavian/Mexican couple who grows to be a fraile in a remote town in Oaxaca, one of Mexico's poorest states. Ignacio dreams of being a pro wrestler and longs for the love of sister Encarnacion (downplayed by Mexican poster-girl beauty Ana de la Reguera). The movie tells how Igancio becomes the wrestler he so much dreams of becoming and in the way he befriends ""Esqueleto"", a hobo from Oaxaca with peculiar fighting skills. NACHO LIBRE is an offbeat parody of one of Mexico's most beloved cult sports but within the parody, the film makers make an accurate portrayal of what life in rural Mexico is like. Some of the actors and plenty of extras are truly Mexican, down to the groupies at the wrestling matches, so realism is always present. Some of the humor is decidedly intended for Mexican audiences and in that respect NACHO LIBRE will surely win many Mexican fans. On the other hand, we are never given much background on the characters: we never really know why Ignacio speaks English SO well, as well as some of the townsfolk. You have to remember this is rural Mexico, not Cancun, not Acapulco, where it's easier to find English speaking natives. Even ""Equeleto"" for being a plain bum, his English is spectacularly articulate, not to mention the orphan kids at the convent and the priests themselves! Flaws aside, I must confess I did laugh out loud and my wife enjoyed it even more than I did, so I guess NACHO LIBRE and Jack Black achieved their purpose of putting a Mexican parody on film.

77,the amorphousmachine,Disappointing follow-up from Hess!,4,13 February 2007,"There are two good things about 'Nacho Libre'; one is the cinematography, and the other is an ""inspired"" performance by Jack Black in the title role. He's actually pretty good, and stays well in character. However, the movie just cannot sustain itself, and there are little laughs to be found. I think I laughed once, if lucky! I think Jared Hess's follow-up to the excellent 'Napoleon Dynamite' is disappointing, but wouldn't really be a huge blemish on his career in the long run. I noticed that he has a fixation for aerial shots of food so far. 'Nacho Libre' tries to be quirky, but ends up being irritating, and not even Peter Storemare can add much to this film. Ana de le Reguara is a beauty to behold, but she absolutely had no chemistry with Jack Black, nor did she add that much to the movie. The sidekick character in Esqueleto (Hector Jimenez) was downright irritating. The plot of the film was silly and weak, and its humor seemed to be deliberately paced at a meandering level. Where 'Napoleon Dynamite' was able to deftly use that pace to display the introspectiveness and isolation of its title character. I felt the quirkiness worked better in Hess's previous film.I wouldn't recommend 'Nacho Libre', but if you are a fan of Jack Black or Hess's previous film, you may want to see it and decide for yourself. I was thoroughly bored though, and found 'Nacho Libre' too slow and predictable with very little to laugh at.** out of *****!",Nacho Libre

What could have been an interesting fable turns out instead to have squandered much of it's opportunities. It's the first Jack Black movie for me - I don't count King Kong - and I found his humor, of mostly sight gags, to be soft and airless. He may be one of the top comedians in American movies today, but I find most of those people to be very weak replacements to the comic geniuses of the past. Tom Hanks is the last comedian I found to be genuinely creative and intrinsically funny.What did interest me was the total use (or was it misuse?) of a foreign culture as the comedic environment. I guess it's up to the Mexicans to decide whether Black is lovingly teasing them for gentle or harder purpose. When they make fun of themselves, that's one thing.

The fart jokes were unnecessary. Napoleon didn't have any toilet humour in it what so ever. That movie didn't need any. But it's like Paramount told Jared Hess ""You need toilet jokes in this movie. It does star Jack Black after all."" Jared had no choice but to put toilet jokes in it. The farts just come out of random and have no purpose. Maybe 5 year olds liked it. The only joke I found funny was when the villain Sancho is getting his massage and his trainer says to him ""Sancho is number 1. His legs are number 1.""

He's also no Groucho Marx or W.C. Fields when it comes to intellectual humor; and I did not go to his newest work, ""Nacho Libre,"" expecting to see a Preston Sturges or Billy Wilder comedy masterpiece, either.What I did see, however, was a film that is stupid with a capital ""S"" but funny enough in it's 90-minute run to persuade me to give it a slight recommendation. I laughed more often than not, so, it worked for me.Black slobbers a meandering Spanglish accent all over the place playing Ignaciao (""Nacho"" for short), a dumpy goofball raised in a rural Mexican orphanage, who later becomes the single worst cook in the world (which he blames on the friars for not buying him proper ingredients). He's not very competent in his monk's duties, either, as he gives the last rites to a man who was just sleeping, for example. Secretly, however, he learns to be one of the Lucha Libre (masked wrestlers who earn fame and adulation in the nearby village).When the beautiful nun, Sister Encarnación (Ana de la Reguera, who looks more like Winona Ryder than Winona Ryder), comes to the brotherhood, though, he wants to impress her by providing a better meal than the terrible refried beans and chips he serves every day. Seeing a poster in town for a luchador wrestling match which pays the winner 200 pesos, he recruits Esqueleto (which means ""The Skeleton,"" played by Hector Jimenez), a lanky street criminal who once stole the orphanage's nacho chips, and they form a ridiculous tag team.In cheap, homemade outfits, and with no grappling skills whatsoever, the duo loses, naturally, but gets paid anyway (because the crowd likes them). The losing continues, even though the two attempt to hone their skills by hurling fruit, arrows, rocks and beehives at each other, and climbing up a cliff to drink the yolk from an eagle's egg. Despite earning more and more money (which Nacho uses to buy ""important"" items like white shoes, polyester stretch pants and powder blue leisure suits), they would like to win a match - at least once.Conveniently, a battle royal between six other grapplers to decide who will fight the local champion, Ramses (Cesar Gonzales) for 10,000 pesos. When Nacho finishes second to El Silencio, he's booted out of the monastery, but things might just work out for the forlorn loser, anyway. And while this is clearly Jack Black's film, much of the picture is stolen by Jimenez (sort of a whacked-out beanpole Cantinflas), who has some of the best lines and is involved in a few hilarious situations.Written by Mike White (who penned Black's ""Orange County"" and ""School Of Rock"") and the Hess brothers - Jared and Jerusha (""Napoleon Dynamite""), and directed by Jared Hess (""Napoleon Dynamite""), this isn't going to rate very high on the Cary Grant screwball comedy meter, with far too many scenes of people passing gas, and the slapstick level a notch or two below the Three Stooges.

It can't even be bothered to follow the rules of lucha libre or tell us about its traditions and culture. Instead, Black and Jared Hess are more concerned with depicting the luchadors as pricks, and I'm shocked that César González - who plays Ramses and is a real-life luchador - didn't set Black and Hess straight!Silencio uses a tombstone pile-driver on Nacho in the Battle Jam, which is illegal, as is the luchadors beating Nacho and Esqueleto with their belts! Also, Ramses would have been disqualified for ripping off Nacho's mask, and Nacho could not have won by pinning Ramses outside the ring! Señor González, why the hell did you go along with this garbage?!The showdown between Nacho and Ramses is an exhibition -- meaning both are paid squat!

82,rparham,Not an excellent order of Nacho,7,21 June 2006,"Whether you like Nacho Libre or not really comes down to this: If you found Napoleon Dynamite amusing, then you will most likely generally enjoy Libre. If, however, Dynamite's charms leave you dewildered, then Nacho Libre is probably not a good selection for a night at the movies.Nacho Libre has a rather uncomplicated plot: Brother Ignacio (Jack Black) is a friar at a Mexican orphanage who dreams of two things: providing better food for his young charges and becoming a famous wrestler (known in Mexico as a luchador). He also finds himself attracted to a new nun at the orphanage, Sister Encarnacion (Ana de la Reguera). Wrestling is looked down upon by his fellow friars as a sin, so Ignacio has held off on pursuing his dream. But, finally, with the assistance of a street waif named Esqueleto (Hector Jimenez), Ignacio makes the move to become a luchador by hiding behind a mask and taking the name Nacho. Nacho and Esqueleto are not a successful pair, they lose consistently, but become beloved by the crowd and continue wrestling, while Ignacio tries in vain to win the heart of Encarnacion.Nacho Libre has a great deal in common with Napoleon Dynamite, the previous film directed by Jared Hess. Between camera angles, framing choices (Hess almost always shoots characters in the dead center of the screen, directly facing the camera) and a similar style of performance for many of the supporting characters, it wouldn't be incorrect to consider Nacho Libre Napoleon Dynamite's distant Mexican cousin. However, the presence of both Jack Black and co-screenwriter Mike White (who wrote School of Rock among other films) brings a different angle to some of the material, and at times, it's easy to see Black and White's influence on the film. Black performs Ignacio as a compromise of his usually boisterous self and one of Hess' open-mouthed, blank stare caricatures. Some of the occasional bits also have that crazy set piece mentality that has informed Black's previous work.The film has a decent amount of funny moments, from Ignacio and Esqueleto fighting two short wrestlers that look like trolls from hell to Ignacio's occasional left-field statements (""It sucks to be me right now!"" he says at one point). However, Nacho Libre never really takes off. It is not exactly dry humor, but it is not exactly inspired either. And as ridiculous as some of the wrestling matches are, they aren't really over the top hilarious either. The film also has almost no real suspense at all: it is very much the typical sports underdog story, with the little guy trying his best to pursue his dream and never give up. The films progression is never in much doubt. The romance, if it can be called that, between Ignacio and Encarnacion is half executed and fairly weak, without a clear resolution at the end.So, is Nacho Libre worth seeing? It is funny at times, but not so much that it can obtain a whole-hearted recommendation. And it also suggests that when Jared Hess gets ready to make another movie, he needs to move outside the Napoleon Dynamite box and look for something new, perhaps not even a comedy. Considering how much of Nacho Libre looks like Napoleon Dynamite in Mexico, the audience may not come back for round three.",Nacho Libre

84,TheMovieMark,"Thank goodness for Jack Black, the saving grace",6,15 June 2006,"Watching Nacho Libre is a weird experience. Just when you're convinced that you hate it and you're making plans to hunt down director Jared Hess and punch him in the face, Jack Black goes and does something totally outrageous that has you unashamedly laughing out loud. Hess should thank Black, his saving grace, because about 15 minutes into the movie (with hardly a laugh in sight) I was already forming a posse.It says a lot about Black's talent that his mere presence can keep a film afloat. His contorted facial expressions, decidedly unsexy poses, fake Spanish accent, and tendency to break out into song is enough to keep his fans, like yours truly, entertained. His narration of a letter he wrote to Sister Encarnacion is particularly hysterical. But the movie's strong point also exposes its main weakness - without Black this film is a disaster.Feel free to send your letter of thanks to the screenwriters for that. The script is surprisingly weak, the plethora of bathroom jokes giving testament to that. Who sits around and thinks, ""Hey, smearing manure on a guy's face would be HIIII-LARIOUS""? And what purpose, other than appealing to the least common denominator, is served by having Nacho occasionally accompanied by really fake-sounding farts? I question the necessity of such bathroom humor, my pupils rolling 180 degrees into the back of my head at each poop reference, yet at least 50% of the audience howls with laughter. Cheap laughs, ""purpose"" be thy name.Thank goodness for Black's ad-libbing. There's no other way to explain the laugh-out-loud moments. Even when a slice of dialogue is obviously weak on paper, Black is skillful enough to make it work. It looks effortless. Unfortunately, Nacho Libre doesn't sustain a high enough laugh-to-head shaking ratio to make me a completely satisfied viewer.I can appreciate the film's desire to offer something quirky and original, but I can't appreciate its inability to be consistently funny while doing so. There are just too many stupid jokes that fall flatter than Kate Moss' ... current hairdo.Nacho Libre is one of those films that will be more enjoyable on a second viewing thanks to the wonderful mechanism that is known as the fast-forward button. I know where the good stuff is and can hopscotch my way to it. Disappointing? A little. Since I like Jack and his over-the-top stylings, this is a movie I wanted to love all the way through. Walking out of the theater, feeling slightly relieved that it wasn't ""as horrible as I feared"" just isn't a benchmark of greatness.THE GIST Nacho Libre is blatantly going after the same cult following that affixed itself to Napoleon Dynamite (same director, after all), and that's fine - it'll definitely have a following. You don't need Fodor's Guide to Nacho Libre to figure out if you'll be a part of this following.If you've deemed the trailer the funniest thing since Johnny Betts' last review then go have a blast. If, like I, you're on the fence then don't risk it - save it for a rental. And if you don't like Jack Black at all then this is definitely NACHO kind of movie ... BWAHAHAHA! Sorry, but considering some of the bad jokes the Hess brothers forced on me, I figured I owed 'em one.",Nacho Libre

I thought it was interesting that his character was more concerned about the appearance of his wrestling costume than his body.There are so many promising ideas that come to nothing, such as the two midget wrestlers, who could have been much more funny. And the eagle egg scene is just a waste of time. The ""training"" sequence has a few pleasant ideas, but I was wondering about some of the elements of the training: how hornets or cow manure figured in a wrestler's training.I had a chuckle or two, but not nearly what I'd expected from a Jack Black film.

With the exception of Jack Black(School of Rock, King Kong), there really is no cast member who is well-known outside of the USA. In the Hispanic world, Ana de la Reguera is known for numerous appearances in soap operas and movies, but for the English-speaking audience, she is a complete unknown...at least until the release of Nacho Libre.Directed and written by Jared Hess(Napoleon Dynamite) a director who has gained a well-earned reputation for going against all the Hollywood rules of ""Formula"". To enjoy the schizophrenic world of Nacho Libre, however, you don't have to be to be a genius. It is a uniquely original and zany vision that no one could possibly confuse with reality. However, it is the kind of film that does not frame itself very well in high expectations. It is somewhat counterproductive to announce beforehand, ""Oh, now here we have a very amusing and hilarious movie"". (Despite the fact that for my wife, Carmen and I, ""LIBRE"" most certainly was both!)Perhaps the main attraction here is a surreal simplicity, innocence and freshness, and that its basic raison d'etre is so utterly hair-brained and absurd...but in the best possible way! Shouldn't go into much more detail here, so as not to ruin it for you with anything resembling a Spoiler. But taking this into account, I will dare to offer the following observations: Another interesting element of LIBRE is that, seemingly, it was made tailored to seek out a new market in the United States...The bilingual movie buff!

That is, he put up his own money betting there would be a receptive bilingual viewing audience segment! .It must be noted, however, that there are a number of attempts at humor that flat out do not work in LIBRE. But these flubs, fortunately, are handily outnumbered by scenes that DO produce considerable laughter. The sight of Nacho Libre and his tag-teammate ""Esqueleto"" (""Skeleton"") wrestling and taking on the world is about as close as I ever want to come to dying of laughter! The love songs composed and sung by Jack Black are so slapstick operatic exaggerated, so insanely ridiculous and so poorly rendered, that they end up being immensely entertaining.Most certainly, Nacho Libre is not a classic of the Seventh Art that will be much debated ten years in the future. But it definitely will keep you laughing a lot during an hour and a half of your life!8*.... ENJOY/DISFRUTELA!!!",Nacho Libre

88,patrick_dunne,It's OK,6,16 June 2006,"I don't feel as if I have much time to write this review, so I will keep it short. ""Nacho Libre"" is a film about an orphan who dreams of being rich, and becoming a Luchador, which is a type of Mexican Wrestler. He enters a contest, and wins money, even when he loses. He befriends a thief-type person (A character similar to Aladdin. That's the best way I can describe it.) who becomes his tag-team partner in wrestling.The film has a few puns here and there. Most are somewhat funny, perhaps able to exert a chuckle, but the farting jokes are downright annoying. Jack Black doesn't do such a good job playing a Spanish orphan, because his accent gets annoying.The film is quite silly, but the storyline, and the bad accent of Jack Black, brings it down to somewhat embarrassing. The storyline never seems to make much sense. For a period of the time, Jack Black wrestles without a mask, which is (I think) required. There seems to be no tag-team, and rather two people fighting in the ring at once instead of switching off.Overall, the whole film is cliché some of the time, and has not enough good puns to keep you entertained for the entire running time. To me, it seems pretty much forgettable.6/10Note: It's a kids' film, so what's with the corn poking out some person's eye?",Nacho Libre
89,RogerBorg,"Blah blah, Jack Black, blah blah Napolean Dynamite",2,9 August 2006,"I'll boil this down for you to make it nice and simple. If you theenk that a fat greengo talkeeng like thees ees funny, then yoo wheel love thees feelm. Personally, I don't care that this movie is racist, even though it clearly is; Mr Black is no more convincing as an hombre than he would be as a brutha. But that's not the flaw. The flaw is that it's both dumb and dull. Either one alone could be rescued, but together they suck the life out of it. Sweet, OK, but if I wanted sweet, I'd be watching ""Annie"". This is supposed to be a comedy. Where are the laughs?There's no overall narrative drive, and each scene drags out just a little too long. Rather than looking forward to the next scene in anticipation, it's more a sense of relief that the current one is finished. The writing is sloppy, and relies far too much on Black carrying the film, a task which is just beyond him. In terms of production values, it reminded me of a Xena episode, but without the joie de vivre. To stick with the Raimi theme, Black is no Bruce Campbell.I would strongly advise against paying to see this movie, unless you really, truly, can't find anything better to do.",Nacho Libre
90,The_Orenda,A unique treat for everyone.,6,16 June 2006,"I have fallen asleep every time I watch Napoleon Dynamite. Without fail. But aside from embarrassing myself to every reader, I have to say that I did not mind Nacho Libre at all. The dialog is fine yes, and fart jokes are strategically, if not diabolically, placed from scene to scene. But Nacho is very much a visual film. A treat for the eyes where, with the obvious exception of Ana de la Reguera, actors are not beautiful or glamorous or drowned out in makeup but are real. Their faces have more expressive character than anyone in Hollywood does and, with that foundation, you can build a comedy around that, package it, and let the talent do the rest. With that in mind, I have to say Nacho Libre is a fantastic movie in its own right and Jack Black, well, he just runs wherever the script lets him.Ignacio grows up all his life wanting to be a luchador. The monastery slaps a ladle and pot in his hands and makes him cook to make some kind of use of him. But inspiration returns to him when he sees a chance at making money in the sport he so often wanted to do.Jared Hess made a smart move by letting Jack Black run around with the film. From making Ignacio sing for Encarnacion or Ramses, the comedy comes from Black's wit in knowing how Hess wants the film. Extra thumbs up goes to Nacho's partner, Esqueleto, who lets Hess run wild with his unusual imagination. No one knows really the hows or whys of Esqueleto's stance on science, or relationships, or even orphans for that matter but Jimenez delivers the punches. I recommend Nacho to everyone who loved Dynamite. Hess delivers a Hollywood ending, but throws it so over the top that only your inner 4yr. old might laugh for it. Visually, I enjoyed the real world look of Nacho Libre, with the comedy being a plus. But if you look for consistency and you lack the patience of what could be a generally silent film, maybe wait till it comes out for the home.",Nacho Libre
91,Ozzy2000,Jack Black at his best,10,7 March 2008,"Ignacio as a child is an obese orphan growing up in a very poor Mexican religious orphanage. To cope with the deprivation the young Ignacio fantasies he a great wrestler or in Mexico a Luchador. He even makes up a wrestler's out fit and calls himself ""Nacho Libre"" but he is punished and forbidden to live out his fantasy. Ignacio grows up ( played by Jack Black) and becomes a friar who cooks meals for the children in the orphanage. He loves the children and has a big heart but feels terrible about having to feed them meals cooked with rotting vegetables and spiced up with nacho crackers donated by the town cafe. A nun, Sister Encarnacion (Ana de la Reguera) joins the orphanage and Ignacio is smitten by her and she also is endeared to his devotion to the children. Ignacio goes into town to collect the Nachos when he confronts this deprived beggar Esqueleto (Hector Jimenez)who is stealing the Nachos and a fight ensues. Esqueleto puts up a strong fight but Ignasio overpowers him and decides to befriend him. Esqueleto has inspired Ignacio to secretly enter the local wrestling scene in order to to gain the skills of the Champion wrestler Ramses. He does this so he can win money to help the orphans. Ignacio and Esqueleto get beaten in the wring by everyone but are popular and earn money. Ingansio is found out by the the other friars who banish him from the orphanage. In desperation Ingnasio is inspired by Esqueleto to enter a competition to win a fortune by beating the great Ramses. To add to the motivation he hopes win favour with Sister Encarnacion who finds his forbidden mission has a noble objective. Jack Black's animated self effacing performances and range of silly facial expressions give the character real dimension. An extremely funny film with a very unusual story. It will live on as a classic and is worth the purchase of the DVD.",Nacho Libre
92,Benjamin_Cox,"Like nachos themselves, this film's too cheesy and not satisfying enough - 55%",5,26 May 2007,"Finally being able to get back online after a brief absence, my first duty was to come here and tell you all about a most strange little movie. Starring everybody's favourite bearded psychotic dwarf Jack Black, ""Nacho Libre"" had enough good praise behind to sink the Bismark but for me personally, I felt like I was missing the joke. Perhaps Black should stick to mocking rock as one half of Tenacious D because this doesn't really do enough for me to honestly recommend it.Black plays Ignacio, a bumbling cook in a Mexican monastery who dreams of leaving it all behind and becoming a luchador. When his dreams overtake his duty to the orphans he feeds, Ignacio is forced to become the wrestler of his dreams - Nacho Libre. Teaming up with worryingly thin street urchin Esqueleto (Héctor Jiménez), they face off against some of the more bizarre opponents Mexico has to offer. Sadly, Nacho and Esqueleto aren't up to the standards of the mighty Ramses (Cesar Gonzalez) but spurred on by his forbidden love of Sister Encarnación (the gorgeous Ana de la Reguera), Nacho is determined to become the greatest man in stretchy pants.Black, it has to be said, never convinces as a Mexican at all - his accent veers from scene to scene and the dodgy facial hair looks ready to fall off at a moment's notice. I think that ultimately, whether you'll like this film or not depends almost entirely on whether you enjoy Black's shouty performance. He's like Jim Carrey but without the face-pulling, coming across as little more than a barrel of TNT ready to explode at any minute. With a plectrum in hand, this is ideal but with a weak script, Black's brand of mania isn't quite what is required. To be honest, most of the humour comes from the wrestling scenes which capture the oddness and whirlwind comic violence of professional wrestling perfectly. The rest of the cast gamely try to keep up with Black but ultimately fail.Maybe I'm missing the joke but ""Nacho Libre"" didn't really set my world alight. It's far too hit-and-miss, much like Black's career, to be a really funny film because I do think there was potential here. At best, this is a unusual kid's movie but I'm still not sure whether they'd get the joke or not. Wrestling movies aren't that common but what's the point in spoofing them when they are already pushing the boundaries of reality back as far as they can go? The same applies to spy movies trying to mock James Bond - anybody who watched ""Die Another Day"" will know how far the real thing had left the tracks. ""Nacho Libre"" has flashes of laughter but for me, I'd rather go toe-to-toe with Rey Mysterio.",Nacho Libre
93,DJJOEINC,bring on the luchadores,2,16 May 2007,Nacho Libre - I enjoyed Jack Black as the obnoxious clerk in High Fidelity and the obsessed neo-con in Bob Roberts - I even own and have laughed @ the first Tenacious D album.I am burnt out on his schtick- School of Rock was like having my teeth pulled and his talk show appearances are the same note.Even so I am a life-long fan of the pro wrestling and love the luchadores.This broken Spanglish offering is about a loser priest that decides to take up wrestling in this offering from Nappy Dynamite director Jared Hess.I don't get it- it just doesn't work and it borders on belittling to the colorful history of Mexican wrestling.First off like the WCW sanctioned crapfest Ready to Rumble (which actually led to David Arquette holding the WCW strap for almost a month)- this movie treats wrestling as athletic competition and not staged entertainment.And once again wrestling fans are presented as either cross-eyed or not all that bright.This movie will appeal to pre-teen boys with it's mix of fart jokes and cartoon violence- the rest of the family can roll their eyes as little Billy guffaws with joy when Jack Black flexes his butt-cheeks for the comely nun.If you want to check out some good lucha action - netflix the Rey Misterio WWE DVD which features his great 1997 with the late Eddie Guerrero.The DVD has commentary by the star and the director- delted scenes and several featuretttes.

94,teh_mode,Really Good Fun,6,22 August 2006,"""I ate some bugs, I ate some grass I used my hand to wipe my tears"" so sings Jack Black just before he is about to risk life and limb against Mexico's finest masked mat-magician. Indeed there are at least two occasions during Nacho Libre where our portly protagonists bursts into song the rest of the movie could have been complete pants yet these two moments of comedic brilliance would have, at least, made the trip half enjoyable. I usually hate comedy songs - indeed the worst moments in the hit TV show Family Guy are always when the characters decide to drown out the humour with verse - yet Jack Black manages to make these moments the highlight of his films. Throw in a few pairs of stretchy pants, an incredibly thin tag team partner and some psycho midget wolf Wrestlers and you have yourself a pretty darn funny movie. Most of the time, anyway.Black plays Nacho, a soup jockey working in a rural Mexican monastery. He serves horrible looking meals, Oliver Twist style, to a collection of orphans. Fed up, he decides to pursue a career of lucha libre, seeking out a tag team partner, in the mould of thief-cum-really skinny tramp Esqueleto (Héctor Jiménez). All well and swell except his monastery doesn't approve of luchadores, so he must keep this a secret from his fellow monks and nuns. One particular nun, Encarnacion (Ana de la Reguera), becomes the object of Nacho's desires which is an obvious conundrum to the man. They share toast together, although Nacho is careful not to reveal his secret.Some things in movies are just funny: fart gags, midgets and Jack Black singing. It doesn't take a genius to pull these types of gags off, which is inevitably why most of the film's funniest gags are from the front man of Tenacious D. Jared Hess' previous claim to fame was Napoleon Dynamite which, although incredibly funny in parts, wasn't half deadpan. He decides to stick with that style for his latest project and although it is interesting to see that kind of straight-faced humour mixed with the dirt and weirdness of Hess' vision of Mexico, it was probably not the best way to tell this kind of story. Audience reactions were far higher when Black was allowed to run amuck with his wide-eyed shtick. Nacho Libre may not be the cleverest film in the world, but it doesn't spare on the laughs. Consistently amusing, occasionally hilarious, you shouldn't be disappointed.",Nacho Libre

The jokes have a sweet, sort of surprising approach and with, at times, a darker touch. I must admit that I choked a few times out of laughter. Jack Black's character ventures into some utterly weird projects, and with his companion, they're forming an excellent pair whose future adventures are anything but easy-going. I must emphasize the beauty of the scenery in this flick, as the surroundings are giving it a certain magic touch.I must definitely get into some more of Jack Black's stuff after seeing this one. 6/10 - well worth a shot.",Nacho Libre
96,guyfromjerzee,"Fans of ""Napoleon Dynamite""....enjoy the show",7,17 June 2006,"""Nacho Libre"" contains much of the same dry, deadpan humor that made ""Napoleon Dynamite"" so much fun to watch. I'm sure Jared Hess's brand of humor is not for everybody. We're living in an era where Dane Cook is our top comedian. So if you're expecting the same loud, obnoxious gags you see in most comedies nowadays, you'll probably be disappointed. I, on the other hand, love this type of humor. Just like in ""ND,"" the actors don't try hard to be funny. Jack Black is not very convincing as a Mexican. With his skin so white, he sticks out like a sore thumb amongst the rest of the cast. But that's no big criticism. This is a comedy farce, and if his accent didn't sound so phony, I doubt his character would be nearly as funny. As an extra treat for all the ""ND"" fans out there, his character is paired off with a soft-spoken Mexican buddy. They make a good comic team, with Jack being so short and fat, and his buddy being so tall and thin. I tend to just roll my eyes at many of the crude gags I see in movies nowadays, but I even enjoyed the bathroom humor in this movie. I found myself laughing most of the way through, and this is one of the rare cases where I felt that the film lived up to its trailer. Some of the funniest gags were given away in the trailer, but there are many other funny gags that weren't. If I have any complaints, the movie does sort of drag in the third act. But all in all, ""Nacho Libre"" is good fun for the entire family. I can't wait to see Jared Hess's next project.",Nacho Libre

Jack Black is also a very funny man--irritating at times, yes, and massively overrated by adolescent audiences who practically worship him, but funny. There has rarely been a Jack Black comedy that I did not enjoy to some degree. So, I was very happy to hear that Jared Hess, the writer and director of ""Napoleon Dynamite"", and Jack Black would be teaming up for a movie about a Spanish friar who becomes a wrestler to save an orphanage. My only reservation was that the plot seemed a little too thin. Unfortunately, my one reservation turned out to be downfall of the entire movie. This plot, had it been done as a skit on some such show as ""Saturday Night Live"" or possibly even ""Mad TV"", would have worked flawlessly. Unfortunately, the plot runs far too thin over the approximate one and a half hour runtime and this one-joke comedy falls flat.Nacho was raised in a Mexican monastery and became a devout man of the Lord. Feeling shunned by the entire monastery, Nacho (Black), now the monastery's cook, decides to follow his dreams to become a professional wrestler. As the monastery's finances hit an all-time low, Nacho decides to join a wresting tournament so that he can win the prize money and provide good food for the monastery's orphanage. This plot sounds so sweet and caring. It seems like the perfect movie for Jack Black. Look what he did with ""School of Rock"" after all. Well, to my displeasure, this plot is almost completely ruined by offensive and gross humor that just takes away from the heart of the movie. It is again Hollywood's way of showing that they feel that teen audiences will only understand fart jokes and stupid humorof course, for all I know, maybe that is the general thought of teenagers, as many seemed to enjoy this movie. Watching an obese woman scurry like a mouse across the floor will certainly make people laugh, but don't expect to get an award for putting it in your movie. A seven-year-old could make up the same joke.The performances in ""Nacho Libre"" are actually good. Jack Black proves once again that he is absolutely hilarious and that he can make even the most idiotic, worthless lines in ever put on paper comical. Unfortunately, this movie just wasn't enough for him. It didn't give him anything to go on and the only reason any of his jokes worked was because of him. I had never seen or heard of Ana de la Reguera before, but now I can say that, not only is she quite talented, but she is also one of the most beautiful women to have ever graced my eyesight. She just clicked in the role and it worked wonderfully well. Héctor Jiménez, who plays Nacho's bumbling partner, Esqueleto, kept me laughing continuously. He did a very nice job and it was very effective when partnered with that of Jack Black's. Darius Rose, who plays an orphan named Chancho, didn't have many lines, but, what can I say, I just enjoyed him. He was adorable. The rest of the cast did their job. It is unfortunate that they were wasted on such a sub-par movie.""Nacho Libre"" just does not work. Its plot is stretched far too thin. The heart of it all is soiled by moronic humor and sickening jokes that just don't work. I very rarely laughed and, if I did, it was because of Jack Black or another member of the cast. And that leads me to the bright side of ""Nacho Libre"": yes, the cast. This cast was justwell, for lack of a better word, they were on. They all clicked, had excellent chemistry together, and pumped as much life as possible into the flat script. After Jared Hess's ""Napoleon Dynamite"" kept me thoroughly entertained for the entirety of the movie, I was surprised to find myself so often bored with ""Nacho Libre"". Something was lost here and I have yet to understand what it was. All I know is that ""Nacho Libre"" is not a good movie and yet, because of its cast, it is completely worthless. There is a small reason to watch, if only to watch Jack Black work. But, if you are not a fan of Jack Black, then avoid this movie like the plague. I like Black, but I am done with this movie and with this review.Final Thought: Yikes! This is Jared Hess's surprisingly disappointing follow-up to his hysterical ""Napoleon Dynamite"".Overall Rating: 4/10 (C+)",Nacho Libre

What made Jack Black hilarious was the fact that he is back to his old tricks again: A stupid character who isn't sexy for one second of the whole movie.

Most of the ideas and gags in the film are ridiculous and characters are more cartoon-ish than flesh and blood. It's that kind of comedy which you can love or hate as it uses very specific kind of humor. I must admit that I moderately enjoyed it. Director Jared Hess applies mainly slapstick and numerous funny characters appear. It is obvious that Jack Black has a huge comedy talent and he possessed this rare ability to amuse viewers by only one look or gesture. Without him, the film surely wouldn't be so laughable. The supporting actors are well-casted, but they do not make such an impression as Black. Furthermore, the movie isn't dead funny. Obviously, in comparison to other comedies produced nowadays Hess' flick stands comparison and even surpasses most of them. However, the screenplay should be better developed and more complete. There is only a little bond between threads and the movie seems to be a collection of separate episodes at some points. Moreover, the movie is aimed especially at kids who should be pleased by all the undemanding jokes. All in all, Nacho Libre is a bit disappointing flick that is definitely saved by Jack Black's great performance.",Nacho Libre
105,Pasafist,if you like weirdly sweet Mexican wrestling comedies this is the film for you,7,23 June 2006,"It's good to know that farce is alive and well in the world. Since the mid 90's it feels like film makers have lost their grip on truly great weird comedy. Movies that speak to the few and turn off the rest. It seems that even as the tools to unlock our imaginations get flashier and flashier, and special effect budgets grow and grown, American film grow static and stale. Then when it seems like all hope is lost, a film like NACHO LIBRE comes along.Somewhere in Mexico, a young priest named Nacho (Jack Black) longs to be recognized. He's tired of serving the same bland food to the young boys in his charge. He's tired of being disrespected by the other priests. He longs to be a luchadore (a Mexican wrestler), and to gain the affections of the stunning Sister Encarnación (Ana del la Regura). Then when all hope is lost he teams up with a new friend named Esquelta, and takes the Mexican wrestling world by storm. Will the orphan boys get better food? Will Nacho win the heart of Sister Encarnación? Will he lose everything he has, on a quest to become a great warrior? Giving this movie its due will provide those answers and more. The movie not perfect. It's a little overlong and some of the jokes fall flat on their face. But there is an earnestness and a sweet gentility in the film that will win you over. You cannot enter this movie with the wrong attitude and if you don't like weird movie its not for you. But if you let it entertain you and if you give into the fact that it really bizarre, it will work. You have to take every scene with grain of salt and logic must be thrown out the window. But if you turn off that part of your brain that strives for everything to be plausible, than this film will entertain.Then for no apparent reason the movie does something I didn't quite expect, it begins to tackle a serious subject. Behind all the silliness is a story about how legalism traps us in a place of boredom and predictability. Whether it be religious legalism or secular legalism, NACHO LIBRE is about a misfit who succeeds because he goes out on a limb. He doesn't give up his religious fervor when the chips are down, when his atheist friend tells him to give into science and logic, and he doesn't give up on God because men of cloth treat him badly. He stays true to his faith and not his religion. This message is not beaten over the audiences head. This is not a religious picture. But it gives the film a dimension that I didn't expect.Director Jared Hess, doesn't stray to far from his Napoleon Dynamite roots. But that's okay. It works here and he hits the right comic tones. I can't wait for the DVD because I'm convinced that the film really needs to be viewed a second time. Knowing what to expect allows the audience to settle into Hess skewed comedy. The film is very dry and if you don't know what to expect its easy to dismiss the comedy and think the film is horrible. You have to work at it a little bit and let it sink in. But when you get it you'll love it.If you're looking for an hour and half of silliness you can't go wrong with NACHO LIBRE. It's cute, sweet, and you get to stare at Jack Black's upper torso for far too long. Trust me if you like weirdly sweet Mexican wrestling comedies this is the film for you.",Nacho Libre

But, somehow (and by 'somehow' I mean 'due to misjudged direction') it didn't come off. Jack Black is like a wind-up toy when he's at his best, and you should just point him in the approximate direction you want and hope for the best, but Hess' films are all about little chuckles and being desperately indie and the two don't sit well. Because of this, when the film is funny it is jarring, as Ignacio (Black) seems to be two men  not a priest and a luchador, but a funny man and a not-very-funny man! Having said all of that  it isn't that bad. Worth a look if you liked Napoleon Dynamite (which I did) but I'd say rent, don't buy.",Nacho Libre

110,eichelbergersports,Stupid with a capital 'S' but funny enough,5,14 June 2006,"Okay, so Jack Black is no Buster Keaton or Harold Lloyd when it comes to physical comedy. He's also no Groucho Marx or W.C. Fields when it comes to intellectual humor; and I did not go to his newest work, ""Nacho Libre,"" expecting to see a Preston Sturges or Billy Wilder comedy masterpiece, either.What I did see, however, was a film that is stupid with a capital ""S"" but funny enough in it's 90-minute run to persuade me to give it a slight recommendation. I laughed more often than not, so, it worked for me.Black slobbers a meandering Spanglish accent all over the place playing Ignaciao (""Nacho"" for short), a dumpy goofball raised in a rural Mexican orphanage, who later becomes the single worst cook in the world (which he blames on the friars for not buying him proper ingredients). He's not very competent in his monk's duties, either, as he gives the last rites to a man who was just sleeping. Secretly, however, he learns to be one of the Lucha Libre (masked wrestlers who earn fame and adulation in the nearby village).When the beautiful nun, Sister Encarnación (Ana de la Reguera), comes to the brotherhood, though, he wants to impress her by providing a better meal than the terrible refried beans and chips he serves every day. Seeing a poster in town for a luchador wrestling match which pays the winner 200 pesos, he recruits Esqueleto (which means ""The Skeleton,"" played by Hector Jimenez), a lanky street criminal who once stole the orphanage's nacho chips, and they form a ridiculous tag team.In cheap, homemade outfits, and with no grappling skills whatsoever, the duo loses, naturally, but gets paid anyway (because the crowd likes them). The losing continues, even though the two attempt to hone their skills by hurling fruit, arrows, rocks and beehives at each other, and climbing up a cliff to drink the yolk from an eagle's egg. Despite earning more and more money (which Nacho uses to buy ""important"" items like white shoes, polyester stretch pants and powder blue leisure suits), they would like to win a match - at least once.Conveniently, a battle royale between six other grapplers to decide who will fight the local champion, Ramses (Cesar Gonzales) for $10,000 pesos. When Nacho finishes second to El Silencio, he's booted out of the monastery, but things might just work out for the forlorn loser, anyway. And while this is clearly Jack Black's film, much of the picture is stolen by Jimenez (sort of a whacked-out beanpole Cantinflas), who has some of the best lines and is involved in a few hilarious situations.Written by Mike White (who penned Black's ""Orange County"" and ""School Of Rock"") and the Hess' - Jared and Jerusha (""Napoleon Dynamite""), and directed by Jared Hess (""Napoleon Dynamite""), this isn't going to rate very high on the Cary Grant screwball comedy meter, with far too many scenes of people passing gas, and the slapstick level a notch or two below the Three Stooges. Overall, though, unless you are really uptight, or buy into the nonsense that this movie is somehow offensive to Latinos, you'll probably snicker at the total absurdity of the effort.",Nacho Libre
111,RichardKleiner,Great fun!,9,15 December 2007,"Contrary to what others may think, I did find several artistic merit to this film. But above all, Nacho Libre is a great comedy. It doesn't fall to the gross out genre that most films do. This is a more fine type of humor. The jokes can be understood better by Mexican people, since wrestling is part of our culture, and so are the settings and religious values (although I'm not catholic). I don't know why so many people say they didn't enjoy it. Those would probably be the average audience for such movies as Crappy-- sorry, Scary Movie. It's more difficult nowadays to find a good comedy film that you don't need to watch before showing it to your family. This one can be viewed by everyone, and still laugh out loud.Jack Black, as usual, is great. And so are all of the other characters, most especially Esqueleto. And of course, the resemblance of Ramses with the legendary ""Santo"" is uncanny. The only difference is the mask's color.Nacho Libre is completely underrated by several people.Seriously, if you find simple and non elaborate jokes hilarious and you still think gross out is not at all funny, this can easily be your pick.",Nacho Libre

In fact, it looks like a film student could have made this movie. Except for the fact that a film student wouldn't have the guts NOT to move the camera! Like Dynamite, the strength of this movie is the performances, in this case Jack Black, who makes the whole film work. You have to be a Jack Black fan though, my friend who isn't really didn't care much for the film. I was surprised to see it delving deeper than the hysterical poster and premise led me to believe.

If you didn't, or if you can't stand Benny Hill, the Three Stooges, SNL, or... well, ANY absurdist, skit-based, none-too-pc comedy with mildly tasteless humor and the occasional predictable pratfall - Ne-VER MIND! My wife and I laughed heartily several times and smiled indulgently a lot, which puts this light years ahead of ""Curse of the Jade Scorpion"" and WAY too much other higher-toned failed comedy. It doesn't compare structurally to Black's crisp ""School of Rock"" and is nowhere close to the intelligence of ""High Fidelity;"" this is just a campy jokefest, which should be fine if that's something you can handle.Yeah, this picture COULD'VE been better, and if you're looking for stuff to DISlike you'll find many problems: campy plot, disjointed pacing, gags that don't come to an apparent punchline... But that kind of absurd irrationalism can work, and if it works for you, you'll enjoy this film.I don't want to give anything away, but the relationship between Brother Nacho (Jack Black) and Sister Encarnacion (Ana de la Reguera), lustful on his side, sweetly bewildered and uninterested on hers, is one of the main sources of humor here! If you don't get that, I don't know what business you have reviewing comedy. More could have been done with Esqueleto (wonderful performance by Hector Jimenez) and Candida (Carla Jimenez), true, but get over it!

116,BJBatimdb,Shocking waste of talent,2,27 February 2007,"As a fan of writer Mike White, I was really looking forward to this movie but it was so bad I'm still reeling. First let me say that the director did a great job in one respect. The film looks amazing, so hats off to the cinematographer and art director too. It's shot like a Mexican Amelie, with the same scenic eccentricity. It has a beautiful and engaging visual style and the wrestling scenes are well choreographed. Where the film falls woefully short is in the script and the casting of Jack Black. It comes over like a film that was written as a rather whimsical little oddity and then suddenly bumped up to Hollywood 'comedy' status as a vehicle for Jack Black. In so doing, any subtlety or gentle comedy that may have been present originally has been trampled by JB at his mugging, farting, sophomoric worst. I think Black has his place in film, but this sure ain't it. He plays the wrestling-mad priest with the heart of gold like something from The Dukes of Hazzard. Maybe he knows there's not a funny line to be had in the whole debacle, because he mugs and flails throughout, trying to make his perm and his fat gut work the room for him. The film itself grabs desperately for a fingerhold on funny, it'll take it any way it can get it - relying on Black's Mexican accent, random farts and a frantic soundtrack to try to bolster a story crying out for the human touch. The tacked-on 'relationships' are by-the-numbers and without a single iota of authenticity. The whole thing plays like a sketch that would have been pushing the envelope of humour at two minutes, forget two hours. I can understand children finding it fun, and adults who accompany children to movies they find funny usually get a buzz out of that, so on that basis I gave it a 2. But miscasting AND poor writing is a double whammy that no film can recover from - and I don't think the director is to blame. It's not that the lines aren't hitting the comedy mark - they just aren't funny in the first place. It's truly tragic to watch so much hard work and talent - not to mention money - go to waste. Oooh it's shocking!",Nacho Libre
117,Troy2Slick,It was just okay...,5,17 June 2006,"I wasn't expecting anything monumental, not by any stretch of the imagination. However, this is Jack Black we're talking about. The same guy that brought us the sweet and funny, Shallow Hal. The same guy that brought us School of Rock.Instead, I was subjected to a movie that didn't really know what it wanted to be. It had it's funny moments, but even then, they seemed pretty much forced. I liked the concept of the movie, as it's not been overly done as of late.With all of that in mind, that doesn't mean that I entirely hated the movie. It was just a fairly mediocre flick, that's good to kill off an hour and a half if you are extremely bored. This isn't the type of movie that I'm going to go out and buy... heck, I probably wouldn't even go out and rent it.Hopefully your next vehicle is much smoother, Jack.

Granted, I was tired at the point, but it does not help when the movie almost puts you to sleep.Honestly though, I know that this movie will make a good amount of money just because of what is said about it. The previews were funnier than the movie, that gets people to come. Besides, if you stick Jack Black's name to a movie it's guaranteed to make some cash, and I expected that.

I missed this in its theatrical run but having just watched it on DVD expecting nothing I am very pleased to say that this one of the most original films I've seen all year. Naco Libre is one note and pretty plot less but it never trys to be anything other than fun. None of the gags feel forced or out of place making for a very smooth and enjoyable viewing experience. I have nothing bad to say about Nacho at all. Like Napolean Dynamite you either love it or hate it. I honestly believe Nacho will outlive Napolean in the years to come though. Even toned down Jack Black beams with manic depravity you can literally see it in his numerous facial expressions. I have been anticipating the Tenacious D movie forever but now im a little worried because of good he is as Nacho. Jared Hess does remind me of a less pretentious Wes Anderson and thats a good thing believe me.

So, I went in and expected to really hate this movie... I ended up giggling throughout the movie! No belly laughs, but lotsa snickering and giggles throughout! Not bad, but it could have been much better! I must hand it to Jack Black in the fact that he never played the character as anything but silly and not taking himself seriously throughout the film. If he would have played him sincere, then it would have been a total disaster! Not taking himself seriously was the only thing that remotely saved this movie!

In a continuation of his hump-a-single-note series, Jared Hess takes the wild and wacky world of Mexican wrestling and lampoons it for about an hour and a half too long.In what Jared Hess must have considered to be a ""high concept,"" Jack Black plays a monk in a monastery who turns to Mexican wrestling in order to raise money for an orphanage. It sounds slightly more interesting than a feeb trying to get his friend elected class president, but this movie turns out to be about as watchable (which is to say, not at all) as Napoleon Dynamite.With predictable set ups and punchlines, there is nothing at all to make this movie worthwhile. There's a lot of jokes about the outrageousness of wrestlers, some lame crap about how to prepare to become a wrestler, and some really stale jokes about tight clothes on men. Unfortunately for Jared, if you've been through the sixth grade, you've heard all of these jokes a long time ago - and they weren't funny then, either.So forget all of the nonsense you've heard about this movie being culturally insensitive and concentrate on what really matters - it's just a plain, old bad movie executed by men and women who should have been told ""no"" during pre-pre-pre production.",Nacho Libre

The truth is this film has NOTHING to offer. AT ALL! It's a lousy script with crappy characters and really naff acting and direction. You'll watch endless moments where you think something funny is surely about to happen but it just doesn't. I was bored stupid about 10 minutes in but though it would surely pick up. It didn't. 90 minutes later I'd barely managed to stave off an aneurism it was that painful.It's like, remember years ago when you'd see anything with your fave actor in it, even some of their really early pap from before they were famous, and you'd be really embarrassed that said actor was actually in such a load of plop. Yeah it's like that.I've enjoyed some of Jack Black's earlier movies like Shallow Hall and I'm really looking forward to seeing Pick of Destiny but come on man. If you do this to us again Jack I'm gonna have to come round there and hammer your kneecaps or something.

127,brodie_kashmir,"Funny, but to specialized",6,10 July 2006,"The Frat Pack has been exploding all over the place. Will Ferrell has had his starring vehicles. As has Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, Owen and Luke Wilson and Jack Black. Jack Black beats Owen Wilson and Ferrell and freshman initiate Justin Long to the summer movie comedy throne with Jared and Jerusha Hess' follow-up to Napoleon Dynamite, Nacho Libre. Nacho Libre is about a man (Black) who was raised in a Catholic run Mexican orphanage. He studies to be a monk and is employed as the resident chef, making food that would be considered cruel and unusual punishment in the American prison system. But while he enjoys his work, he still desires to achieve his life long dream of becoming a Luchador (wrestler). This goes against the teachings of the monastery, so he fights in near secrecy as Nacho Libre, donning a mask to conceal his identity. He hopes to fight in a title match, winning money for the orphanage to have better food and a mode of transportation to go on field trips.This film is really intended to hit only a few specialized audiences. Kids who will watch anything thrown at them (it's produced by Nickelodeon Studios), Jack Black fans, Napoleon Dynamite fans, and to a much lesser extent, wrestling fans.Black runs this film. Where in his other films, like School of Rock and Shallow Hal, he had to rely on the supporting cast to really make the film, Nacho Libre could have been an hour and a half of just Black running around in tights, and it wouldn't have made much of a difference. But it serves for a very interesting paradox. While Black dominates this film, he doesn't come off as completely overbearing, as one might have expected. It's his film, but he's oddly repressed enough to allow his Mexican co-stars (each making their American major film debut) Ana de la Reguera and Hector Jimenez show off their talent.The heart of the film still beats with all the marks of the Hesses. It's slow, simple and quiet. But not to the extent of it being bad. But again, you really have to have liked Napoleon Dynamite in order to fully enjoy this new venture. One can only hope that the two quickly learn that while the formula may have worked once (and now perhaps twice), it won't work every time, and they explore their range of film-making.The wrestling scenes, while far between and almost too short, are highly entertaining, and should make any wrestling fan let out even the faintest of laughs.It's an enjoyable film, but I'm afraid a bit too specialized, and my tastes are too broad to adequately suit it.",Nacho Libre

The story line sounded great and Jack Black can and has been very funny (""High Fidelity"", ""School of Rock"", MTV Awards, even ""Saving Silverman""), but this is shockingly unfunny. Some of the movie's gags require a long and tedious build up, like the quest for the Eagle's egg, with no payoff whatsoever (was the egg yolk on his face the funny part?). Scenes at a party with Jack and his sidekick have a beginning, a middle and just fade out to a non-finish (was the corn on the cob in the eye the funny part?).I usually like politically incorrect comedies, sprinkled with some of the deadpan humor on display here, and that's the reason for the 5/10 score. Jack's slightly mangled Spanish caused me to smile, as well as some classic facial ticks of his. But, it didn't make up for the uninspired wrestling scenes, a ""forbidden"" romance that was neither sweet nor touching and gags without payoffs. The fact that this stuff can make $80 - 100 Mil @ the box office, will only encourage more.

Ana de la Reguera is pretty.Seriously, though, I laughed out loud many times (most uproariously when Jack sings his special song close to the end of the movie--wait for it), and while this is not the best movie ever or even among the funniest, it's nice to go to a movie and laugh at things that were meant to be funny (unlike, say, the recent Omen remake where most of the audience laughed at things that were meant to be spooky or, I imagine, the new movie Lake House, where foolish paying customers will laugh at Keanu Reeves trying to act serious). For some reason, I'm not a big fan of comedy films in general--they don't make me laugh much, with some notable exceptions. But this one was pretty entertaining.More seriously, I would love to know how this movie goes over in Mexico, or even among Mexican-Americans. Is it a loving satire of several aspects of Mexican culture, including wrestling, or is it a racist exploitation of age-old derogatory stereotypes of Mexicans? Or, perhaps, both. I guarantee you that some people will be very offended, and I can certainly see why. It's one thing to parody American rock stars (as Black often does) or American high school students (as in Napoleon Dynamite, the director's previous hit), but another thing to parody people who have always been parodied, generally with either malice or ignorance or both.

In Achool of Rock, he had a humorous supporting cast, the same with Shallow Hal. Now in this film, his latest, he has nothing. This film shows he cannot a comedy on his own. Jack, go back to playing greedy ignorant morons like you did in King Kong. For Jack to be put in the ""Brat Pack"" category with the likes of Vince Vaughn, the Wilson Bros, etc. is an insult to those comedians.

(the problem with the party and their leaving the party is someone put what I consider some unbelievably tasteless violence/slapstick that did nothing for my enjoyment of the movie.) This movie is warmhearted, inspiring, and just plain fun.",Nacho Libre
137,adudewhoiscool,I do not think I have seen a PG rated comedy as funny as this.,8,19 August 2006,"I had a wonderful time viewing ""Nacho Libre,"" which was written by Mike White of ""School of Rock"" and directed by Jared Hess of ""Napoleon Dynamite."" This had a very ""Napoleon Dynamite"" feel, which was much unexpected with the physical comedy of Jack Black, but it still worked well and better than I would have expected. If you liked ""Napoleon Dynamite,"" you will likely enjoy this movie. Also like ""Napoleon Dynamite,"" this movie is a love or hate type movie. I loved ""Napoleon Dynamite,"" so I loved this.Ignacio (aka Nacho Libre), as a young orphan, always had dreams of becoming a professional wrestler. Instead, he grew up to be a Monk at an orphanage. Ignacio loves the children, but does not like the way his life has become. He is also upset that he cannot provide enough food for the kids, the other monks, and a nun named Sister Encarnación. When a local wrestling contest offers a cash price, he looks for it as opportunities to not only provide for everybody but to fulfill his lifelong dream as well. He teams up with a local homeless man to become an amateur tag team. As his fame goes up, does Nacho forget why he began fighting for in the first place? Jack Black brings another lovable character to the table. Everything he does is hilarious. His accent is funny. His facial expressions are excellent. In fact, his eyebrows, like Jim Carrey's butt, deserve a separate credit in itself. This film, like ""Napoleon Dynamite,"" is loaded with many memorable quotes that will be quoted for a while. He is the lovable loser/underdog that you just cannot help but love, just like ""Napoleon Dynamite."" Nobody could have provided the role of Nacho quite like Jack Black.The rest of the cast is fantastic as well. I especially loved Héctor Jiménez as Esqueleto. He was the perfect sidekick to Nacho. Exactly like how Pedro was the perfect sidekick to Napoleon. Nacho is big, while Esqueleto is skinny. Nacho is a ""man of God,"" while Esqueleto is a full on ""man of science."" Seeing Esqueleto get beat up was definitely a highlight of the movie. Other hilarious cast members include ""Satan's Cavemen"" who are a couple of dwarfs that wrestle our two heroes. I would expect that fight to be nominated at next year's MTV Movie Awards for ""Best Fight.""I needed to applaud Jared Hess for keeping this movie PG. This movie is humorous without relating to sexual, Farrelly brothers type humor. I do love ""Dumb and Dumber,"" a Farrely Brothers movie, it is my favorite movie, but a movie like ""Nacho Libre"" and ""Napoleon Dynamite"" are truly great breaks from the typical crude/sexual/profanity filled comedies of today. This way you can make a movie the whole family can view.I do not have much to complain about here. It did its job, which was to entertain. It actually really surprised me about how funny it was. I do not think I have found a PG rated comedy this funny. If I had to choose one complaint, it would be that the humor is too similar to ""Napoleon Dynamite,"" but it is not a problem since I loved ""Napoleon Dynamite."" The movie was so similar, in the credits I expected some tatter tots to pop up somewhere randomly.Overall, you will probably tell what you think of the movie, by either looking at the trailers or posters or seeing the movie ""Napoleon Dynamite."" Coming in I expected this movie to be either great or completely stupid. Luckily, I did not get the later. This movie was definitely worth the price of admission and it is a worthy addition to my DVD collection!",Nacho Libre

140,raven_blood88,"Vulgar, at best...",1,29 August 2008,"I watched this film at a friendly get-together after we voted which of our various films we should watch. As the film began, I knew this was going to be bad news. However, I swallowed back politely, and endured this agony. (*Possible spoilers*) First off, this film slams and makes fun of the Catholic Church so much, it almost made me (a very devout Catholic) want to puke. Nacho is the worst and most exaggerated bad Catholic monk I have ever seen. From his whole destroying rosaries and various other religious objects to make his lucha costume, to his flirting *EWW* with the local nun. (Did the director even grasp that monks and nuns do not flirt, and remain celibate?) Why didn't they just make them ""in training to be celibate religious people"", then the relationship could have worked? Oh, but wait! I keep forgetting. That would have been the smart thing to do.The rest of the film consists of forgettable farting and potty humor, which isn't even remotely funny. I don't know about you, but seeing Jack Black's beer gut and butt crack are not my idea of a good time. I swear, this film should not have as high a rating as it does. Maybe I'm a little biased because I'm Catholic. Who knows? But I can guarantee, even if I wasn't Catholic, I probably still would have hated this. 1/10.

A man of god wants to become a wrestler to help the orphans of his church. But he needs a tag team parter, so he finds this guy who looks like a twig (who is also hilarious) and they fight together.

143,ninjagaiden007,Not nearly as good as Napoleon Dynamite.,4,9 January 2007,"Nacho Libre"" is one of those films where the personnel involved are more interesting than the movie itself. Director Jered Hess follows up his successful ""Napoleon Dynamite"" with a new film that lacks all of the idiosyncratic charm of the earlier effort.In the previous movie, Idaho came off as strange land that was in its own way as exotic as something J.R.R. Tolkien might have created. With a Mexican monastery as a setting, Hess' imagination isn't as fertile.A lowly friar named Ignacio (Black) has spent most of his life cooking for the orphans and the monks who live with him. Better known as Nacho (presumably for the fact that he both makes and eats a lot of nachos), he has never been able to get past his secret longing to become a luchador.He forms a tag team with a skinny thief named Esqueleto (Héctor Jiménez), and the two secretly enter the ring for real. Despite some painful training, Nacho and Esqueleto lose most of their matches but earn enough money to prepare better meals for the orphans. The pay also helps make up for being clobbered by a pair of ferocious midgets.Back at the monastery, however, his fellow friars would not look kindly on his new activities, and a pretty nun (Ana de la Reguera) that Nacho pines for thinks luchadors are doing the Devil's work.Despite some over the top moments, ""Nacho Libre"" seems curiously listless. Black can earn a few chuckles simply from the fact that his bulky frame belies his volcanic energy. Big guys aren't supposed to be able to run around like he does.Many of the gags that Hess, his wife Jerusha and ""School of Rock"" writer Mike White come up with fall as flatly as Nacho does during the middle of his matches. After a while, it becomes tiresome to watch Nacho and Esqueleto taking yet another beating.In ""Napoleon Dynamite,"" our nerdy hero gradually became more dignified as the movie progressed, making him progress from a butt of jokes to a genuinely sympathetic character. Nacho's transformation isn't as well conceived.Napoleon Dynamite had well written character development. This one does not.Both ""Napoleon Dynamite"" and ""Nacho Libre"" had loose story lines, but the former had so many moments quirky surprise, that the threadbare story didn't matter. It also helped that Hess avoided using a lot of flatulence gags and other overused crutches that have used to death in the first film. This time around Hess embraces bodily function humor but lacks Mel Brooks' or even the Farrelly Brothers' gift for making it amusing.""Nacho Libre"" would have been more enjoyable if Hess had found a way to present Mexico in the same oddly delightful way he depicted Idaho.",Nacho Libre
144,santegeezhe,"A few scattered laughs, but mostly forgettable",4,23 December 2006,"This is one of those movies where I could sort of see where the writers/director were headed, but they didn't quite get there. It's not truly wretched, but then again, there's no real reason to recommend it either. I suppose if you're a huge Jack Black fan it would be worth watching, but that's about the only reason.I actually wasn't aware that this is the same director who did ""Napoleon Dynamite"", but it all makes sense now. This movie is ""airy"" in the same way that film is - it's visually driven rather than dialog driven, and the barely-existent plot moves along at a snail's pace. There's just not a whole hell of a lot to keep one's interest. Consequently, I must have day dreamed through at least a third of it.For once, Jack Black's idiosyncratic comedic stylings can't rescue this flick. He does his usual bit - making up stupid songs, bumbling about, reveling in his fatness, etc, but none of it is able to produce more than a few scattered laughs. In fact, this could well be a career-ender for him.I should also mention that there is a goodly amount of wrestling in this movie, so if you're a wrestling fan you may get something more out of it than I did. I hate wrestling.To sum up, there's no real reason to watch this unless you really love Jack Black or wrestling.",Nacho Libre

A friend of mine said it was actually pretty funny so we gave it a try. I really liked it! The soundtrack was awesome! and the cinematography was very good, and I really liked the acting. All of the characters were played to a T in my mind. As for the commentator that said this was a Christian feel good movie..whatever dude... I really got drawn in by this. The guy that played Escueleto was hysterical! And of course sister Encarnacion would make most guys have uncomfortable feelings towards a nun. I liked Jack Black in it. He's usually not my cup of tea, but did a really good job in this. When he was doing his stretching exercises in the park with the Sister there..it was hilarious. The whole training thing with launched melons and beehives was surreal!. I bought in to the whole movie in that it was about a subject I had no interest in (luchadores) and an Actor that I'm lukewarm about (Jack Black) and it all came together for me into a wonderful entertainment experience. Good job all!",Nacho Libre

Jack Black is hysterical as Ignacio (""Nacho"") the cook and errand boy from a remote monastery deep in Oaxaca, Mexico, who is a good-hearted guy who only cares about the orphans at the monastery and is treated like crap by the priests there because of his poor cooking and his constant obsession with becoming a luchador, but this dream comes true when he least expects it and at the time when a gorgeous hottie nun, sister Encarnacion (Ana De La Reguera) comes into his life. Nacho teams up with a skinny thug from the street, Esqueleto (Hector Jimenez) who mugs people for chips, and later become tag-team partners. The whole movie, including the training sequences, the dialogue between the two, and the fight sequences are hilarious. Esqueleto pretty much steals the show at times from Nacho. The rest of the moments with the children and sister Encarnacion are funny as well. Especially the nickname of one of the children which translates as ""piggy"" in English. Overall the movie is very enjoyable and your children will fall in love with Jack Black. The movie has all the fart jokes and toilet humor that children have come to love over the years, but it's still watchable and fun to enjoy with the whole family. And most importantly the movie although silly, like its main character, has a heart of gold.",Nacho Libre
148,glocksout,Yawn inducing melodrama,3,15 September 2006,"Jared Hess is the creator/director the suckfest Napoleon Dynamite, and he's joined forces with Jack Black for this tour de force, and the results are predictable: 100 minutes of awkwardness with moments of wannabe rock-star. I don't imagine the preceding is very kind, but what can I say? Sensationalism sells.Jack Black is an orphan who grows up to work in the orphanage, but his real passion is Los Luchadores (wrestling). When the orphanage comes across bad times, he finds an accomplice and competes for money. It is a story of tension between who he is and who he wishes he was. It's actually a great story, I don't don't like the pacing Hess uses, and his inability to invoke any emotion out of the actors other than awkwardness.A few parts were pretty funny, but overall it was yawntastic.",Nacho Libre
149,tawdry_hepburn,"very funny, if shallow",8,14 June 2006,"Preface: I will avoid giving specifics on the movie in this review. There is nothing more damaging to a comedy that knowing the jokes before hand. Since I liked this movie, and it was funny. I shall shy away from spoilers. Jared Hess shoots his movies like a funny David Fincher. His obsession with grime and dirt and everything looking old and decrepit, is almost fetishistic. But he has grown a lot since we last saw his work, (shooting extreme close-ups of steak and tater-tots in Napoleon Dynamite). Not to sound cruel, but I was surprised while watching his latest effort, Nacho Libre, because, wellit looks like a ""real"" movie. There is dynamic lighting, proper shot composition, and interesting camera movements. I guess a budget increase from $400,000 to about 38 million makes a difference. Oh, and by the way, the movie is very, very funny. I'm talking cola out your nose funny. Starting with the addition of (the brilliant) Mike White to his writing staff, Hess has crafted a much more cohesive and narratively satisfying film.Though it does keep the skit-ish nature of Napoleon Dynamite, stuff actually happens in this film. The movie, (apparently based on a real monk, though the end of the credits state that the film is totally fictitious) tells the story of Ignacio (Nacho for short), an orphaned boy who becomes a monk at an orphanage. Nacho is in charge of ""Cooking duties anddead guy duties"" and is generally looked down upon by the other monks and priests, though the children love him. After the orphans nacho's are stolen by a homeless man and the head priest humiliates Nacho for his pitiful meal preparation skills, Nacho--who's greatest love in life is masked luchador wrestlingdecides to enter a tag team match, with the thief as his partner. They lose, horribly, but discover that even the losers get paid. And with money, Esqueleto, the street urchin (and yes, those are his real teeth) can live comfortably and Nacho can buy better food for the orphans. Orphans who are hilariously always referred to as ""the orphans"", as if to constantly reminding them of their misfortune. Also, during all of this, Nacho is trying to woo the new girl, Encarnación, who just happens to be a nun with the same name he has. Given the current battery the Catholic Church is taking in public opinion, it is nice to see a movie that never once mocks the religion. Sure, there are priests who have the hots for Ana de la Reguera. But the she is so dumbfoundingly gorgeous, it would be silly for any man, much less one who must be celibate, to not at very least look twice at her. The church here is played as a wholesome, good place. There is never any salacious undertone to the scenes between the priests left alone with small children, and nobody ""gets"" the girl in the end, so all the general morals are upheld. Also, it is nice to see a movie about Latin culture starringgaspLatinos! Everyone in the movie, except Black, (who is actually playing a white guy, not a Mexican as many IMDb posters have postulated) is of Hispanic origin. And the culture comes off well.Beck does a few wonderfully fun songs for the soundtrack, and Danny Elfman's score is his best in years. (ironically, shortly after I wrote this, I discovered that he had taken his name off of the film because he was unhappy with the way his work was presented). There is a general irrepressible levity to the proceedings that is infectious. And though the movie meanders more than it should, you can't help forgive its shortcomings because it is so well natured. Oddly in contrast to this are the wrestling scenes. They come off as overly violent, and though this could have just been Mann's Chinese's killer sound system, I could hear bones crunch, and things looked painful. The action scenes aren't farcical like the rest of the film, though some of them are thrilling. Parents should be aware that this movie could be a bit scary for children under 9 or 10, and though the film has a more positive role for minorities and women than any film I've seen in a while; it does seem a little bit inappropriate at times. There is nothing sexual, and there are good morals to be found, but the movie does have a strong line of toilet humor and Punch and Judy level slapstick throughout. However, this isn't really a kid's movie. It is just a movie, that happens to be rated PG. It is made for teens and adults, but there is nothing objectionable enough as to keep kids out. Overall, Nacho Libre is a pretty damned funny movie, with a good heart and lots of laughs. Jack Black even gets to sing, a few times! And while it is less instantly quotable than Napoleon Dynamite it is a better film overall. If you like Jack Black, Dynamite, Wrestling, or your kids have already seen Cars and you want to take them to something else, this movie is about as good as you could hope for. Though not especially deep, it is exactly what I want when I go see a big summer comedy. Now I just can't wait for the Tenacious D movie.Post Script: Prepare to hear ""I only believe in science"" constantly after this film is released.",Nacho Libre

It's got a few scenes which are pretty funny, but most of the jokes are played out and just not very funny. I wasn't expecting much from the storyline but what I got was even less. Some of the wrestling sequences are alright and are well-filmed, but as a whole I just didn't think this movie delivered.Some scenes are overly done intentionally to get a laugh, but in many (if not all) of these scenes they just completely miss their mark. Nacho, for some reason, has a tendency to pass gas at any opportune time (and there are many in the film). I'm sure this is an example of something that is supposed to be funny, but it just doesn't work.The story is uplifting at least, and there's a good message with Nacho trying to do his best to help out the poor orphans that he cooks for, but the movie is ultimately very passable.4 out of 10.",Nacho Libre

The whole over the top character thing just couldn't make me laugh.With this film, it's basically all the same, if not worse. But it's the talented Jack Black that saves the entire show. He basically brings comedy to a new level. His facial expressions, the body language, oh, and i'm not even talking about the Mexican accent here. Simply genius. Definitely see this movie.

154,JoeJames76,"Not so Good, eh",1,24 January 2007,"There are several types of comedies. There are the ones with good jokes, or good performances, or good premises. There are ones that are funny parodies or situationally funny. There are even the ones that are so stupid, they're funny. Sadly, Nacho Libre is none of these, and fails miserably as a comedy in any form.Hess' follow-up to the unbelievably successful and quietly yet riotly hilarious Napolean Dynamite is perhaps a legendary bomb of a sophomore jinx. Never has such promise and buzz been squandered so quickly. Jack Black, single handed saviour and upstager of many a film sets his career three steps back as the lead character, a monk cook at an orphanage who moonlights as el matador, Mexican wrestler.Relying on the odd and ridiculous, Hess tries to recapture the magic that made Napolean Dynamite quirky, yet lovable. However, Black's zaniness works best when the world around him is normal; but in this film his insanity is lost in the sea of ludicrous that populates the film. And none of it is funny. There's just a series of scenes where people get punched or hit or kicked or crushed and it's supposed to be funny. WWE is funnier than this, because they play it straight. This film goes for the laughs and ends up empty.Perhaps the only funny thing is Jack Black's accent, but even that gets tired and annoying quickly. Avoid this film at all costs. In fact, watch Mexican wrestling instead. It has more drama, romance, and comedy than a thousand Nacho Libres combined.Grade: D-",Nacho Libre

So we decided to go see Nacho Libre, which I thought was going to be a terrible Nickelodeon fart-joke movie. I knew that it was by the director of Napoleon Dynamite, a film that I personally detest though will quote time and time again.Lo and behold, it IS a fart-joke movie, but because my expectations were so low, it actually turned out to be a better movie to me than Superman Returns. I really enjoyed this movie because of its simplicity, and it's relative honesty when it came to marketing the picture. It is what it says it is, without beating around the bush. And it's a kids movie that's actually okay for kids to watch, maybe not so much the violence but as long as they know (as most children do) that it's pretend. There isn't any gratuitous sex or skin to worry about, and I thought that it was a really kind of sweet, albeit childish movie.I eventually bought the ""Stretchy Pants"" edition of the DVD.",Nacho Libre
156,TruthSpeaks,"Not bad, but not as good as Napoleon Dynamite",7,17 June 2006,"This movie isn't bad. The humor and timing aren't as dead on as Napolean Dynamite, which was also directed by Jared Hess. Nacho Libre is a simpler movie with a thinner plot. It's good that there is a movie out there without swearing and disrespect of women, but there are plenty of fart jokes and violence to fill that void. The violence wasn't as cartoon-like to me as it was to others; the wrestling matches aren't presented as faked. People get slammed and thrown across the ring, over and over. I found it to be a bit much. I would have preferred it if they had developed the portion of the movie outside the ring more. Jack Black is very dynamic as Nacho Libre, the friar who wrestles at night to make money for an orphanage. I understand that he did most of his own stunts. Jack Black has an amazing confidence and intensity, especially for someone who doesn't have the physique that leading men usually do.I found accusations of racism by some reviewers to be overwrought.One thing that really bothered me was the sound level in the theater where I saw Nacho Libre. It was too loud. They tell us the studios set the sound level, so bad on you, studio. It turned a pretty good film into somewhat of a trial. Wonder why we don't go to the movies? That's why, among other reasons.",Nacho Libre
157,plotlessviolence,Tolerable,6,14 September 2006,"I've liked JB ever since his rare appearance on Mr. Show, but it seems like all he does these days is make bad movies because (apparently) he needs the money. Maybe someone needs to tell Mr. Black that the reason he's hired for movies with no jokes is that he's a comedian and the casting director expects him to adlib all the movie's jokes on set.So the biggest problem is the script, which reflects its origin as a Nickelodeon production by not being funny. Worse is the outright assault on Christian Ascetism, which I find offensive because it's never actually or honestly dealt with. Supposedly the nonviolence issue is resolved by the statement that Luchador-ing is moral when the money won goes towards a good cause (like cute orphans), which is a total antithetical corruption of actual Christian nonviolence teachings. The final fight sequence has JB beating up the bad guy as the song lyrics ""I am a very religious man"" play in the background, for G-d's sake. As for the Vow of Chastity monks take, the movie ends with Nacho's lust still active but without resolving the question of whether he or the nun will break their vows. I don't mind disagreeing with a set moral outlook, but it annoys me when a traditional viewpoint with centuries of literature is grossly and obviously misrepresented or the movie cops out rather than offend anyone either way.I still liked the movie because 1) Jack Black has enough charisma to polish this t-rd into watchability and 2) RASSLIN'! The wrestling scenes are all well done, and The Free Chip might as well be marketed as an action movie instead of a kid's comedy. The midget duo are played for laughs but those little guys have got some MOVES. There's also a move I've never ever seen before, where two wrestlers get behing our heroes, hook their legs with their own and their armpits with their arms, and roll onto their stomachs to hyperextend the heroes' backs; it's very rare for me to see any new fighting move, so well done.All in all, one of Jack Black's better movies, but please, please tell some actual jokes next time.",Nacho Libre

So I head out to Nacho Libre tonight expecting to see a typical Jack Black comedy that would keep me laughing the whole time. Instead I just sat there waiting and waiting for Nacho Libre to start being funny. I don't think it's a spoiler to let you know that it never did. I don't even think I heard any laughter in the entire theater. There were a couple mildly humorous parts, but they were few and far between and most of them were already in the previews. Don't go see this and expect anything along the lines of School of Rock or Orange County. Think more like Napoleon Dynamite with all the comedy removed.",Nacho Libre
161,snazel,"Despite Serious Flaws, I Liked It Anyway",5,17 January 2008,"It is very easy to describe what is wrong with this film. There's a legitimate case to be made that the film is culturally abusive and myopic, and the humor in the film is often stale, forced and dysfunctional. It is much harder however to describe what is right with this film, and why overall I enjoyed watching it.To begin with, as much as Jack Black's channeling of Ricardo Montalban seems offensive, and cheap, there is some love given to Mexico in the film. Specifically the camera demonstrates the beauty of Oaxaca splendidly  and the director of photography uses every opportunity to show the audience the rich, and impressive landscape of Oaxaca, as well as its impressive and unique architecture.The music that blends with the film, is also eclectic, and interesting, I found myself wondering what interesting song I would hear next as the film progressed. The Elfman composed ambiance is good, Jack Black's compositions are designed to be over the top, but the real gold lies in the genuine music that is sprinkled throughout the movie.The story however has some serious warts. The pale allusion to the trials of Moses (and his slow, arching struggle against Ramses), never really flies. I get the metaphor of the ""godless idols"" being slowly defeated by a man with religious and morale conviction to free his children from starvation, but it was never really hammered home. As such, the general struggle of Nacho never truly captivates you, and of course the ending can be seen a mile away. There are also a lot of superfluous elements to the film, little diversions that go nowhere and stifle the ability to build real interest in the main characters.I have to say though, that the wrestling in the film is downright entertaining. I am not a pro-wrestling fan by any stretch of the imagination, but some of the athleticism and impressive choreography in the ""fight"" scenes, resemble a ballet more than a fight, albeit a crude ballet of elephants and freakish dwarfs, but a ballet none the less.The direction is quirky, unique and somewhat interesting to watch, the film is light, never takes itself seriously, and has one or two moments where the actors wink directly at you along the way. Watching the camera work was very interesting, and I thought overall the film was crafted well, but could have used some serious overhaul in the script and story. The comedy falls flat in this movie and far too often to really be forgiven.I spent some time in the state of Oaxaca in the early 90's. I had forgotten how beautiful a place it was. This film reminded me of that beauty, with some spectacular shots of its bright blue sky, its lush green mountains, and architecture that blends so well with the overall landscape. For that reminder, I was grateful. So the landscape coupled with the wrestling scenes (that are fun to watch if you enjoy well-rehearsed and well-timed slapstick) was enough for me to enjoy the film, but probably not enough for me to recommend it without prejudice to others.",Nacho Libre
162,guillermotorofan,"Stereotypical Hollywood comedy, but unusually and unexpectedly enjoyable!",8,13 June 2006,"I recently returned from a pre-release screening of Nacho Libre. I was somewhat looking forward to this film, mostly as I am a big fan of Jack Black, as well as I throughly enjoyed Napolean Dynamite. I will answer your question before you even ask: Yes, this movie is incredibly and somewhat dangerously stupid. But for many of us, stupid is family, and if you are like me, then goofy comedies like this are the perfect film to see. Nacho is a priest living in a monastery cooking for the orphans. The monastery has no funds and he is forced to serve horrible meals from scratch. He has always dreamed of wrestling since he was a young child, but his service to God has distracted him from such life. So with the help of a beautiful woman and his unusual homeless buddy, he sets off to join a wrestling tournament, and win thousands to help the orphans he loves as his own children.Is the plot that serious? Heck no, that is just my description. There is goofiness around every corner, making Napolean Dynamite look mild in comparison. This film is clichéd, and often times a typical Hollywood comedy with plenty of fart jokes thrown in the mix. But this film is so outrageous I didn't even notice I was watching a chubby guy in tights, and surprisingly this film has lots of heart. Very rarely does a film put a smile on my face that refuses to leave. This is one of them. Will you enjoy it? Unless you have a severe goofy side to you, no you won't. Did I enjoy it? You bet I did. So if you were to ask I would tell you to see this film immediately, but be warned, this is definitely not for everyone.",Nacho Libre

I really don't understand how anybody on the planet could enjoy this. I liked some of Napoleon Dynamite but I just don't get Nacho Libre at all. The female lead is lovely and I enjoyed looking at her, but the rest of the picture is so terrible that I can't even remember her performance, name or anything she does in the film. I'm sure glad I didn't pay to see this, I would have demanded my money back. Absolute rubbish.",Nacho Libre

There is an extent cartoon series of Napoleon and Co. if you want more ND-style. I wish I could give this 10/10 but I can't. Maybe that's why the Hess films aren't as popular as they could be as I too fall victim to the runaway success of ND: I feel no film can compare to a first time watch of ND. This is the unfair bit.But ""Nacho Libre"" comes close to ND with several satisfying similarities.""Nacho Libre"" is a heartwarming tale with a style that can only be described as Hess-ian. I'm not usually a fan of ""family friendly films"" but this is an exception, as is ND. Check out ""Don Verdean"" and ""Gentlemen Broncos"" if Sam Rockwell + a Hess vibe is your thing. They use Rockwell perfectly and I'd like to see that pairing continue. Would be nice to see them pair with ol Jack Black again too, for that matter.",Nacho Libre

Overall, I would recommend.",Nacho Libre
166,murrayspeer,"Good clean fun (well, mostly clean)",9,16 June 2006,"What I really appreciate about Mike White's screenplays is that he obviously - like the young writer played by Colin Hanks in White's movie ""Orange County"" - loves his characters. White's talented mix of subtle, ironic humour and laugh-out-loud ridiculousness combines with Jared Hess' simple and smooth storytelling to create one of the most entertaining movies I've seen in a long time.Add to this the comic timing and physical performance of Jack Black (who I realize is not everyone's cup of tea) and a movie that would simply have been entertaining becomes near-brilliant.The dialogue in this movie is simple, the characters are simple, and the plot is simple. It is the careful, loving, comic storytelling of White, Black, and Hess that makes it outstanding. And if subtlety and irony are not your thing, there are a few fart jokes and fat-woman jokes thrown in to tide you over.One refreshing aspect of this movie, in contrast to the recent big-hype ""Frat Pack"" films of people like Ben Stiller, the Wilsons, Will Ferrell, and Vince Vaughn, is that the protagonists are genuinely decent people who the viewer can actually care about.On a bit of a supplemental note, I'm also a fan of professional wrestling (mostly American style, but there has been more and more lucha libre influence in recent years) and I can say the wrestling action in this movie is top-notch. The wrestling is used respectfully as a tool for the storytelling, but the respect shines through nonetheless. There are a couple of ""camera trick"" and wire-flying moments and a couple of editing and/or logistical mistakes (for example, a collar-and-elbow tie-up is converted directly into a vertical suplex without a shot of them changing the hold) but overall the wrestling action is clean, crisp, and a fair representation of what you would see in a luchador ring, keeping in mind that this is a movie that is telling a story, not primarily trying to accurately portray the in-ring world of lucha libre.",Nacho Libre
167,DaleP1979,Nachoooo Cheesy!!!,5,28 October 2006,"First of all, I love all types of movies. I love good clean humor comedies, as well as raunchy comedies (Wedding Crashers, etc). When I rented this movie I knew this would be a clean/ family friendly comedy. I expected some cheesy kid humor thrown in, since this is a NicK production. With all that said..... This movie was painfully hard to watch,.. and painfully unfunny. After 36 minutes of watching I had already pressed the info button on my DVD player to see how long it had been. (only 36 minutes!!! my god, I thought it had at least been an hour or longer.) I honestly don't know what to say about this film. It wasn't the slightest bit intelligent. Not really much of a meaning or moral behind it. And not very funny at all. (A couple times I smiled,.. but not one single audible laugh!!! And folks, I laughed at the movie ""Elf"", so it doesn't take much to make me chuckle at least a little.) And, although I expected the cheesy humor, the on-going ""fart"" joke got really old.This movie was a big waste of time.",Nacho Libre
168,phatworld,Slap stick laughs without a story. (Mediocre),5,15 June 2006,"Jack black proves to be a jack of more than one trade. Although I think this could be one of his best performances, the movie is simply lacking. If you take into account that it is produced by Nickelodeon it isn't all that bad. Be forewarned though there is no strong supporting characters, a pitiful repetitive soundtrack, and no evolution other than a predictable plot. The entire story could be shortened to 20 minutes without missing anything relevant. I would say it's more suited toward children, although I think one part involving an eye gouging would be rough for kids under 6. I gave it a generous 5 because I expected the movie to be goofy, I just didn't expect to see most of the laughs in the previews. You could tell the audience felt the same as they laughed the hardest at the few very funny parts not in previews. This obviously because most of them are not situational.",Nacho Libre

It comes from the same people who made Napolean Dynamite and School of Rock, both two of my favorite movies and so I thought this should be similar, and it was but there were differences from those two films in terms of humour.Jack Black is, like in many of his other films, excellent in this.

It is not for everyone, I went to see it in theaters with my uncle and he never cracked a smile so it dumb dry humor isn't your thing, don't watch Nacho. If you love Jack Black, this is a must see! It is amazing how Jack can carry a movie were virtually the entire rest of the cast is unknown to the Hollywood world. I lived in South America for two years and the people in this movie, especially the older cast members, remind a lot of what life is like in the traditional south American towns.

That is typical Latinamerican humor: irreverent and straight (e.g., calling such a nice kid 'Chancho':Pig, as nickname). Tongue-in-cheek Latinamerican comedic humor indeed. Here in wonderful USA we don't do those things, oh, no... we just think them! Give me a break, PC land. This movie IS funny.

The script had room for jokes but they never came. Whenever a film has to resort to a fart to make the audience laugh, there just isn't much to entertain you. Jack is an actor that feeds off support and he had none in this film. He was literally walking the plank while trying to deliver humor. Good guy triumphs and everyone leaves with a warm fuzzy feeling. I left wondering why Jack Black took the part.

After this I have been racking my brain to think of one good role that he has performed. The only thing I can come up with where he was o.k. was as a necessary foil to the John Cusack character in 'High Fidelity'. Jack Black is one of those awful relentless flat-out ham-it-up knockabout guys (like the little fat one in Abbot & Costello or Jerry Lewis) who should be told that being overbearingly idiotic is not the same thing as being funny. It is not even slapstick. It's just irritating.

It was certainly different from most other comedies that I've seen lately, more down to earth perhaps in some ways. I'm Swedish so I'm not so accustomed to the Mexican culture and thats where the story takes place, possibly that had something to do with it as well. In any case Black is i.m.o. doing his best performance as an actor in this movie - playing the title role. He is kind of overacting but pulls it of thanks to his character (meaning it only in a good way), mixes the funny and comic acting well with the more dramatic aspect of it... I think it might be the unfamiliar environment and the almost surreal mix of comedy/seriousness that makes this movie well above average. Because I did enjoy it - a lot... Go see it.",Nacho Libre

A hilarious addition to Jack Black's filmography, Nacho Libre is a story of empowerment of the individual and that the underdog can often surprise even the toughest critics. The humor is directed mainly at viewers between the ages of 13 and 17, but adults can also enjoy the jokes and comedic situations.The directing style was very well done in certain instances, but was more often than not a basic approach to filming. The color scheme was effective in representing the idea of a typical Mexican monastery with browns and tans and other earthy tones, but then throwing in vivid reds and bright blues for the wrestling costume of Ignacio (Black). In addition, although it was sweet, the subplot of a love story between Ignacio and Sister Encarnacion (de la Reguera) seemed to be thrown in for no reason than to attempt to make the film ""well-rounded"". The orphans were the most lovable throughout the film, especially the one who convinces Ignacio to keep pushing on with his childhood dream of becoming a famous wrestler.Although not for everyone, I certainly enjoyed this film, if for no other reason than it was a fun way to pass a couple of hours. A typical underdog story of triumphing over impossible odds and getting the girl of your dreams, Nacho Libre is a light-hearted, uplifting story, but in essence seems to be better suited for a teenage audience.",Nacho Libre

Hess, who served as a Mormon missionary in Northern Mexico where the movie is filmed, has created a movie that has a character all of its own, and it's a character that is true to the people who are portrayed. I think what critics don't like is that, this movie has its very own style. It isn't formula. It doesn't have what every other movie has, so it may be judged inferior. It will appeal to those who enjoy seeing something different who can watch a movie just to be entertained. Don't scratch your head trying to figure it out. Just watch it and enjoy its uniqueness.

He is a bit of a goof. But an OK goof. On the negative side.Jack Black's fade in and out pseudo Spanish Mexican accent was  well  bad.The bathroom humour was well  in the bathroom.

No lesson was taught nor was that happy feeling that you get when yo walk out of the cinema.

184,blaisepascal,One of the funniest movies I've seen in some time,9,24 June 2006,"If I could use one word to sum up Nacho Libre, it would be silly. And I mean that in the best way possible. All of my favorite comedies are completely silly, and Nacho Libre is no exception. There is plenty of stuff that makes no sense, as you can pretty much tell from the first ""training"" scene. But the chemistry is there with the cast and the script is so off-the-wall that you have to be completely lacking a sense of humor to not crack up while watching Nacho Libre. My only slight complaint about the film is that sometimes Jack Black is a little too Jack Black and not enough Ignacio. He lays his normal schtick on a bit thick now and then and puts the character and the lucha libre storyline on the backburner. But as a fan of lucha libre I really loved the way it's portrayed in this film. There are some nice action sequences and the last fight scene is really unique and well done. Plus the Human Tornado cameo will have PWG fans marking out.Sometimes when I read the comments people leave for silly comedies like Nacho Libre it makes me wonder why they saw the movie in the first place. What did you expect? Do you even like comedies? It seems like some people are offended when movies try to make them laugh. Why not relax and just try to have a good time? I have a hard time imagining how anyone could hate Nacho Libre. It's visually pleasing with some beautiful cinematography and fun action scenes. It has a great soundtrack that fits the unique tone of the movie perfectly. It has great performances from the entire cast, from the bit character old man who always cheers on Nacho, to Jack Black himself who despite my small criticism still gives a great performance. It has a cute little feel-good story. And it's just plain and simple a hilarious and fun film.",Nacho Libre

I expected nothing, yet in return, I received a wonderful 1 hour and 40 minute respite from the real world, filled with slapstick humor and total silliness. Slapstick humor always walks a tightrope between bad taste and belly laughs. The Three Stooges are mind-numbingly inane: most laugh intensely and some never get the joke. Laurel and Hardy isn't for everyone either. Nacho Libre is not filled with Woody Allen irony, it doesn't have Christopher Guest's drollness, and it's not James Brook slick. It's not sophisticated humor! How can any film featuring Jack Black as a Mexican friar/fryer/wrestler/wannabe wooer ... all for the ""good of the orphans"" be taken seriously? It's simply for the 12 year old boy in all of us who laughs when Moe hits Curly and laughs when fat guys, even with over the top Mexican accents, are paired with skinny guys ... in a wrestling ring ... with stretchy pants.I originally wrote this as a reply to a poster who asked if the mean IQ of people who liked this was 93, but the post was subsequently deleted. But to him I say, ""By the way, I'm a physician and my IQ is a tad over 93. But even if I had no job at all and even if my IQ was 93 ... who cares ...

Most of the ""jokes"" were either mildly funny seventy years ago or fell flat even then, and it looked as though whole scenes were missing throughout, it was that disjointed. Then again, I haven't thought Jack Black was funny since HIGH FIDELITY. Take a look at some of the old b/w Three Stooges shorts from back in the thirties and forties--they did a few wrestling parodies that worked good as shorts, but they had the sense never to try and extend those routines into a feature-length film.

The rest of the story is fairly predictable, but that isn't really the point now is it? The point is that Jack Black is hilarious and his Nacho character is both funny and enduring. I found myself rooting for him and laughing the whole movie, and not just at the staged jokes and the scenes displayed on the trailer. I also liked that a musical scene was incorporated, any Tenacious D (Jack Black's comedy rock band) will appreciate and enjoy this scene.

This is a role that clearly was written and designed for Jack, because no other actor could have performed the role the way that it was. Speaking of designed perfectly, the wrestling scenes are very well choreographed and in fact look very real.About very real, a quick word on Ana de la Reguera, who played the charming Sister Encarnacion. Her role, to keep the storyline anchored in reality, was perfectly acted, with very positive results: everyone in the movie theater with me felt warm and safe as Sister Encarnacion was trying so hard to keep Ignacio on the straight and narrow.This film is made very similar to ""Napoleon Dynamite,"" meaning that the movie primarily uses static camera positions and very few multiple angle sequences. I heard complaints from friends about the filming method used in ""Napoleon Dynamite,"" and present the warning: if you didn't like the technical aspects of that movie, you may not like ""Nacho Libre.""I'm sure that director Jared Hess expected to make a hit, but I doubt that even Hess was expecting a film that would touch the emotions of as many as he is, because this movie presents much more than a very funny story, but as it's anchored with a good story, I think that it's also the best movie that Jack Black has ever done.Go Nachoooooooo!",Nacho Libre
191,psy008,Viva Nacho Libre!,7,19 August 2020,"The movie tells the story of this orphan kid (aka Jack Black) growing up in a monastery somewhere in Mexico. As a kid, he dreamed of becoming a wrestler but unfortunate events led him to become a cook at his church where he falls in admiration with a nun. One day, he decides to make a man out of himself and goes on to pursue his dream of becoming a pro wrestler. With the money earned from his newfound talent he gives back to his church and all the orphan kids there. The humor in this movie is very a la Stephen Chow (like very absurd and out there) but that is why I liked it so much. The story line was good. The cinematography and acting were very good. I guess at first I wasn't expecting much of this little comedy movie, but it turned out to be a good 1 1/2 hours of entertainment.",Nacho Libre
192,nuelow,A great comedy that's apparently too smart for the critics,8,16 June 2006,"I'm really surprised at the way critics are mostly panning this movie. Not only is ""Nacho Libre"" a hilarious comedy, but it's got a script that even the most snobbish intellectual (even well-read pseudo-intellectuals!) should be able to enjoy. Pay attention while watching, and you'll see that the storyline pretty much follows to exactly ""The Hero's Journey"" as outlined by Joseph Campbell. How can a well-read person NOT love a movie that takes a clownish figure through the entirety of archetypal hero's tale (even giving Black's character his own Enkidu?) in the context of bush-league Mexican wrestling and a run-down orphanage.Jack Black once again appears as his standard lovable loser character, but most of his shtick is limited to his appearances in the wrestling ring, and a disastrous attempt to show off his fighting prowess to the lovely Sister Encarnacion (de la Reguera) without revealing his secret. Because it's in small doses, it becomes some of the most hilarious part of the film. Black is supported by an able cast, a well-paced script, and a story that's too subtly clever for the majority of American film critics. These elements all add up to a film that will end up standing as one of the best comedies of 2006.",Nacho Libre

Too bad I will never have that one hour and forty minutes that it took to sit through this dreck, back. Given the fact that Nacho Libre was directed by Jared Hess, who directed one of my favorite films of 2004, Napoleon Dynamite, I was looking forward to some great comedy. But instead, I got a pile of poo-poo. Jack Black plays Nacho, an orphan raised as a man who becomes the cook of a Mexican monastery in Oaxaca, Mexico. The monastery is on the brink of financial ruin, but Nacho finds it in his heart to become the greatest 'Luchardore' there ever was, also known as a Mexican wrestler, to earn money for the monastery and to feed the children. Enter the lovely and beautiful Sister Encarnacion (Ana de le Reguera), who he tries to impress and takes a special liking to her. There's no doubt about it... Jack Black is very funny. His Mexican accent is pretty much played for laughs. And we do laugh when he speaks. Hector Jimenez plays, Esqueleto, Nacho's skinny little sidekick. His facial expressions are perfect for comedy. But there's no story here. No explanation about the sport. Nacho Libre is a complete mess and seemed to be edited five minutes before the screening I attended. I do give kudos to Black for being a sport about wearing tights and having his enormous belly hang out for most of the movie. He just seems so out of place here. The four kids who were sitting right behind me were having a field day with the slapstick humor and fart scenes. And to a point, so was I. But I'm still longing for that precious hour and forty minutes that are gone forever.",Nacho Libre

Director Hess (also directed Napoleon Dynamite) does a great job in giving Black freedom to steal the show. The movie depicts a Mexican Priest who has a secret fantasy to be a Luchador (Wrestler). Nacho Libre (Black) attempts the difficult task of living the life of the Luchador as well as the Priest of the orphanage. Anyone who understands and recognizes Jack Black humor, will strongly appreciate this movie. From the classic faces, to the funny dance moves, he continues to bring on the laughs as he takes over. There are even a few musical performances by Black as well. If your looking for in your face Ha Ha humor like Old School and Wedding Crashers, you won't find much here. However, if your looking for a hilarious background comedy, this movie is filled with it. Jack Black is one of the few comedians out there that can literally carry a show.

He did fantastic things with a limited budget on Napolean Dynamite, and even though he had an expanded budget here, he didn't go nuts with it. Good, solid directing. We have... Jack Black playing a friar? OK, well he's funny and stuff, so this could still be entertaining... right? Yeah, it's entertaining, but do not expect the same magic we got from Napolean. Not to detract anything from Black, who is in top form, but the film would have done better without him. He's funny, he's lovable, and he tells a nun she might look like a floozie. What's not to love? There just isn't the depth to the character needed to make his performance anything other than ""good"". The jokes are all old, the scenes are mostly unbelievable because let's face it... Jack Black as a friar? There is no ""suspension of disbelief"" here, it just doesn't work. Now, Jack Black as a wrestler? Fantastic.You will find parts funny and entertaining, but most of the funny stuff was included in the trailer.

Jack Black gives a fantastic comedic performance (of which couldn't be duplicated by other comedic actors these days). The movie lulls at certain points but some of the lines are very funny. The music (Danny Elfman) is very, very well done (which is rare among comedies) and adds a lot to the comedic feel. The cinematography is really super, not to mention the beautiful scenery. The movie doesn't stoop to using profanity or stupid reused sexual innuendos (which usually are thrown in to make up for poor scripts). In my mind this is somewhat of a cinematic and comedic masterpiece. People will look back in time and praise Black's performance in this just like ""School of Rock"".",Nacho Libre

It was even explained at one point in the movie. (his mother was a Scandinavian missionary) So it's not like they pretend that he doesn't have the ethnicity.The story is a wee bit thin though, the writers probably decided to lean on the impulses of Black. Don't get me wrong, the first half of the movie has several good moments but after that the story get thin and sometimes predictable, a little more work on the story would have been in order. The writers probably wanted to avoid any form of already used ""Rocky-like"" movie formula, but maybe a little bit of formula would have helped. Having things constantly going against them may be funny for a while but it leaves you wondering how they are ever gonna reach their goal. A little transformation of the character would have been nice.Jack Black delivers the usual Jack Black stuff, including some scenes with his trademark singing. Héctor Jiménez, not as much as acts as just has fun with his role, does a good job playing the homeless Esqueleto.

The movie is entirely framed around Jack Black, no one else is even remotely likable or watchable, with the exception of the super-hot nun, who was cast for looking pure and innocent. Once all the jokes that you saw in the preview have passed (most of them in the first twenty minutes), then the humour turns into ""Look! Look at Jack Black's face! Look at all the silly things he can do with his face! Wow, I spent twelve bucks for that!"" Oh yeah, and also, ""Oooo! Listen to Jack Black make a funny accent! Mexicans have such funny accents, but Jack Black makes it funnier! Ooo, he did something with his eyebrows while saying something stupid, but in a Mexican accent, it was funny!""

First of all, the movie isn't the least bit funny. I maybe smiled at some of Jack Black's singing (the only thing that saved this from being a one star rating), but that's about it. The film was EXTREMELY poorly edited with scenes going together that make no sense. The ""sidekick"" is just annoying. The girl isn't hot enough to warrant the looks Black gives her, nor interesting in any other way really. The wrestling scenes are too frenetic, and devoid of any real tension because we don't REALLY care about the characters. From this team, I expected SO much better.

Told me to watch Nacho Libre. I did and the rest is laugh history. The setting for Nacho is very authentically Mexico. Jack is superb as is Jimenez and ""Encarnacion"" aw well as the rest of the cast. I've watched the movie so many times, I quote it (by heart) in conversations now and then. I just bought the CD Sound Track as all the music and songs as perfect. The main song (I love in the movie), ""Mucha Muchacha"" is not in the CD. I could have had a heart attack.

208,fish_stix03,Is this movie funny? I still honestly don't know.,5,1 October 2006,"When it comes to surreal, bizarre characters and hilariously deadpan dialogue, Jared Hess's 2004 film Napoleon Dynamite sets the pace. Now, Hess is back, and this time he's had his $400,000 budget upsized to $38 million, and he has comedian Jack Black at his disposal. Nacho Libre is a film that is just as bizarre as Napoleon Dynamite, but it is a film that at times I found insulting in its laziness and puerile nature.Nacho Libre's premise is terrific: Jack Black plays Ignacio, a Mexican monk who works as a cook in an orphanage. In order to earn money to buy better ingredients, Ignacio joins his strange friend Esqueleto (Héctor Jiménez) in taking on the local wrestling circuit. Along the way, they wrestle two weird-looking demon/midget hybrids (pictured above), and a big guy named ""Silencio"" whose specialty is ""throwing people"". There were several moments in Nacho Libre that made me laugh so hard that I missed part of the next scene. There is also, inexplicably, a fart sound effect implemented every time Ignacio prepares to jump. This strange mix of Hess's bread and butter (exchanges like ""it sucks to be me right now"", ""How come?"", ""How come do you think?"") and immature, lowest common denominator humour makes his new film very conflicting. It has a lovable hero, and admirable intentions, but it makes one stupid joke too many.Jared Hess has a distinct style. It requires every character who is not involved in the main action of a scene to simply stare just past the camera with their mouths slightly agape and their eyes blank. The actors involved in the actionaren't required to do much more. I'm not sure how many films Hess can make before this style gets old and annoying. I think he's almost reached his limit with two. That being said, Esqueleto is hilarious, particularly when you look back on his behaviour after you see the film, and really see how ridiculous he is. There are also two songs that Ignacio sings that almost had me in pain while I was laughing. I was also very surprised to see that Danny Elfman, of all people, composed much of the film's soundtrack. And, for fans of Napoleon Dynamite, there's a nice little visual reference to the 2003 film's opening credits when Ignacio serves the orphans salad.Half-way through the film, I remember thinking ""this movie is not very funny"". In the car on the way home, however, my 26-year-old brother and I recounted several scenes and were in hysterics. Something similar happened the first time I saw Napoleon Dynamite. I simply didn't 'get' the film first time, but on retrospect, and after several conversations with my friends, I decided it was one of the funniest films I'd ever seen, and lines like ""but my lips hurt real bad"" seeped into my everyday parlance. I'm still not sure if Nacho Libre will endure as well as Napoleon Dynamite has, and at this stage, I can't say I'd recommend it. But if you do go to see it, expect to hear the line, ""I only believe in science"" on repeat in your head, over and over.",Nacho Libre
209,commodoresx64,Don't waste your time! Theatre was silent!,2,18 June 2006,"Nacho Libre sounds good on paper: Jack Black + Mexican Wrestling + Napoleon Dynamite Director = a hit.Plot is typical for a sports comedy- unlikely hero enters sports to try to better him/herself and others. He yearns and learns love and faces obstacles that he may or may not overcome.However it falls apart and I want my time back. The funniest parts were in the previews. I should have known better. The film was heavily marketed and will no doubt make a lot of money. However, this is a serious speed bump in Jack Black's career. This was his most talked about film yet and this is his chance to show a wider audience of people what has made him so popular with the youth. (I even convinced my parents that his antics are worthy.) Sadly, Jack Black tries his best, but the director and script utterly fail him.In short, the film is disjointed, not funny and a real yawn. The only funny parts were previewed. The rest of just plain dull. I mean really truly boring. The packed theater I was in was silent. The direction and pacing are just awful; the film has no energy.It's a shame really, Jack Black deserves better scripts.

The first and only time I saw this movie was in the theatre when it came out and at the time I loved it, but I was 16 at the time so I wasn't expecting to like it as much as the first time I saw it. To my delightful surprise, I believe I may have loved it even more this time around. The comedies that have come out these past 10 years have been complete and utter crap. None of them have been funny. None of them have been clever. And none of them made me laugh out loud the entire time like this movie did. A lot of the credit must go to Jack Black. His comedic talent was on complete display here. His physical comedy has never been more prevalent or impressive. He has proved himself with this movie that he certainly could have been amongst the great silent movie actors back in the day. His facial expressions are hysterical and his movements are manic in the best way possible. The director, Jared Hess, did an outstanding job letting us see all of the amazing action on screen with limited cuts, which is such a breath of fresh air nowadays. The tone of the movie reminded me so much of director Jody Hill's movies as well as his show Eastbound and Down, in the way that we are following a character who has a very limited amount of talent but he believes so whole heartedly that he can do the impossible. The music and the cinematography enhances this similarity as well, and it works gangbusters. I believe this very well may be Jack Black's finest comedic performance and it's the one I will most remember him for. So happy this movie exists.",Nacho Libre

It was rainy Sunday and I relented and took the kids to the $1 movies to see Nacho Libre. I was pleasantly surprised. I recommend this movie highly, especially for children.

If he were not in it I probably would have given it a 5 or even a 4. But since he was able to get some true laughs out of me, I had to give in and give it a 6. He at least gives it a certain charm that without him it would totally be lacking. In fact, lets say this, everyone else in the cast, except his sidekick gets a 4, his sidekick gets a 5, Jack Black gets a 7, somehow freakishly pulling the movie up to a 6 for me. Tomorrow I may be thinking 5, but luckily for the movie, I'm voting today. Furthermore, it was actually Jack's singing that brought up the score for me, being a Tenacious D fan, I just can't help myself. I especially enjoyed the song during the credits at the end that pretty much everyone else missed because they couldn't wait to get out of the theatre when it was over; my husband and son (along with his girlfriend) included. I sat and soaked it all in; my own little personal private moment of pleasure. What were the creaters of Napoleon Dynamite thinking?????? THAT film was incredible!

What do you do when you just had a big hit movie and one more joke? You get a backer and make a one note bad film.Husband and wife Jared and Jershua Hess, the creative team behind ""Napoleon Dynamite,"" join forces with Mike White and Jack Black, the team behind ""School Of Rock,"" to try and drop kick another hit with the tale of Nacho Libre. The concept, perhaps the most interesting and funny aspect of the movie, has a Mexican Friar Ignacio (Black) as a man of the cloth that has to turn to Mexican Wrestling to make enough money to feed the orphans.While the film does have a couple of great guffaws and it's share of slapstick antics to shock us into laughing, the bulk of the movie relies on Jack Black's ability to carry the weight of the entire film on his back and suplex it. He can't do it with one joke, but what an effort he puts in. Jack Black does his worst ""typical"" Mexican accent and body slams his signature style of quick quips effectively, but it just is not enough to make the whole movie work .This is the kind of movie that catch phrases come from, but I'll put a figure-four leg lock on anyone that tries to repeat these lines to me. Some times this kind of movie works, but that is when the star has a cast to support him. The script only introduces one other comic character into the movie and he only has one joke too and it's the same one Jack Black is telling.In what could have been a very funny scene with Black singing to the current wrestling champion, the director ends the scene way too short. I'm sure they has a great time filming this movie, but during the editing process someone should have noticed that the film just wasn't working. In the middle of the film is a sequence of scenes that seem to be put in just because the director ""thought"" they were funny. Not only do they not follow the plot or progress the story at all, but they don't even stay in the same genre of comedy. There are two jokes that would have fit into ""Airplane!"" and others that wanted to be in a dark Wes Anderson-esquire comedy.Some positive things I can say is that the costumes and set design was meticulous and perfectly hilarious. The location shooting in Oaxaca, Mexico is beautiful and sets the mood wonderfully. By using the full use of the natural beauty, with the cinematography to capture the amazing work of all the technical aspects of the film, this film was visually compelling.When I left the theatre I saw some younger people still laughing outside, maybe this unfocused film would be funny for someone that has not been jaded by watching intelligent and inspired comedies. Sorry Mr. Black, but I have seen great comedies and this is not one of them.He may be the champ, but I will not step back in the ring with Nacho Libre.",Nacho Libre

Is for fun."" Do you like your movies silly? Are you willing to laugh at situations that are so ridiculous that they don't even have any foundation in reality? Do you think that that wrestling is, at its heart, funny? If so you'll like ""Nacho Libre"", a film that features Jack Black as an orphan who now cooks for orphans (and not very well at the start of the movie because he lacks fresh ingredients) and longs to be a professional wrestler. Why? For the fame, for the fortune, for the pride of winning.There are many references to the conventions of other movies here, some handled convincingly (the ""meet funny"" pairing of Nacho and his funny sidekick) and some handled unconvincingly (the whole training scene while a nod in the direction of great training scenes in other movies, such as ""Karate Kid"" and ""Remember The Titans"" lacks the depth or center to pull it off).Still, I found this movie to be big fun. While I was prepared to be offended by the fake Mexican accent and the odd use of locale the film is so silly and yet so sincere that it is beyond offending. You can't take it seriously, and yet you want to.Of course, Nacho believes that his life will only be complete if he fulfills his dream of being a professional wrestler and we watch him live out his dream in a pleasant journey of pratfalls, leaps from cliffs, consumption of yucky foods (and eagles egg), confrontations with strangers, and rides on a motorized bike that would absolutely thrill me if I were ten years old again. It's like a bike, but more! And the way that Nacho postures as he is about to ""peel away"" on the bike (although with no real speed) makes you feel kid like again.Seeking and living your dream is a noble adventure and I solute any effort, serious or humorous, to illustrate its value. The love interest is both stunningly beautiful and slightly confused as Nacho falls head over heels for her and attempts to court her (against his better judgment and yet he can't stop himself) by inviting her to his room for toast. This reminded me of the glorification of toast scene in ""The Blues Brothers"" and leads me to believe that multiple viewings of this silly film might reveal many more easter eggs and nuggets of insider fun.""Nacho Libre"" also contains some great lines that, like those in ""Airplane"" and ""tHE Forty Year Old Virgin"" are fun to quote out of context. My favorite is uttered by Nacho when his is discovered in his home made wrestling costume by one of the orphans when Nach says ""When you are a man sometimes you wear stretchy pants in your room. It's for fun."" When you are creative, sometimes you enjoy the silliest movies, laugh, and find reasons to get inspired.

But when you put it in the ring with some of the recent successful 'comedies', Nacho Libre all of a sudden seems like the epitome of all things funny.Now let me clear up one thing before I go on: It isn't really fair to use Nacho Libre as an example in a discussion on how average Hollywood comedies are nowadays, because it's really a fun, well made picture. The thing with this second movie from Napoleon Dynamite director Jared Hess is just that, when it comes down to it, it really isn't as hilarious as I had hoped. I'm a huge fan of Napoleon Dynamite, and even though Nacho Libre shares certain style elements with that earlier picture, the movie never really graduates from 'something that is fun to watch' to 'something I want to see over and over again'. I'm sure I'll pop in the DVD someday in the future, it just won't be in the 'watch over and over' pile next to my TV that Napoleon Dynamite is still in.In Nacho Libre, Jack Black plays Nacho, a friar in a monastery somewhere in Mexico, who feels it's time to start following his dream. All his life he has wanted to be a luchador, a wrestler, and when he sees a poster for a local tournament for new talent, he decides the time has come. He teams up with a local petty thief to form a tag team, and it soon becomes apparent that they are two of the most hopeless wrestlers in the history of wrestling. Still, the money is good, and Nacho feels like his day to shine in the spotlights might still come. Of course, Nacho has to keep his identity a secret or he will be kicked out of the monastery, even though he would love to reveal how much of a real man he is to the new sister at the monastery, the lovely sister Encarnacion.More than anything, Nacho Libre seems to be an exercise in style. Music, images and pictures combine to create a melancholy mood, which gives this movie a bittersweet vibe that was also evident in Napoleon Dynamite. But while Dynamite complemented this with some scenes that were absolutely hilarious, in Nacho Libre there is never really a standout moment that makes you crack up as much as you would like to. Make no mistakes about it, Jack Black is brilliant as the main character, as he is perfect in the role of outrageous, lovable loser Nacho. And many of the other supporting roles are also perfectly cast, like Hector Jimenez as Black's partner Esqueleto, and Ana de la Reguera as Sister Encarnacion. And sure, the movie has plenty of moments that will make you smile, most of the comedy coming from small things like Nacho trying to show off his body to Sister Encarnacion while they are talking to each other, or the dimwitted Esqueleto telling Nacho he has never been baptized because he only believes in science. Maybe Nacho Libre will improve in repeat viewings, and at the very least you will always have Danny Elfman's wonderful music to listen to.",Nacho Libre

And those tight pants 😂This movie has been a huge hit in my home with my kids recently.

219,glanzerr,Unexpectedly Hilarious,9,19 June 2006,"I went into this movie expecting little. I was dragged there by friends and otherwise would never have seen it. But thankfully I did, because it was the hardest I've laughed at a movie in the theater since I saw Dumb & Dumber as a 12-year old in 1994. Here are the reasons this movie worked so well for me. 1. I knew going in it was going to be a little off the wall. If you don't expect that, movies will be disappointing, much like my initial view of Anchorman was. 2. The premise, although ridiculous, was at least conceivable. The things that happened in this movie were things that could actually happen. 3. Jack Black at his finest. I loved Black in King Kong, but he was back to old slapstick form in this one. 4. The music. The soundtrack was perfect. Especially the Bubble Gum song in the shopping scene.In conclusion, I highly recommend this movie. I'm not easy to impress, but Nacho Libre was surprisingly good.",Nacho Libre

221,davidwestwell,Very Funny,10,18 August 2006,I consider this to be one of the best comedies of 2006. Simply done and well acted throughout. As a parody of Mexican wrestling I don't think you will find a finer one. Jack Black was terrific especially when he acts his part (with reminisces of the late John Belushi's facial expressions) which he does with great effect. Hats off to all the actors in this film whom carried a great dead pan comedy to the fore. Ana de la Reguera exudes a very sexy style as a nun but in no way insults the religion in any way. The part where Nacho sings an ode to Sister Encarnacion had me and the rest of the cinema in absolute stitches. This was of many hilarious moments during the film especially supported by Héctor Jiménez who surely now must get a wider audience.,Nacho Libre
222,mongoose__49,"Just not funny, even Jack Black couldn't save this one.",2,18 June 2006,"This was possibly one of the worst movies i've ever seen. The story was so very slow, no memorable dialogs of any kind, backyard fight scenes, and just no jokes once so ever. The word I could best sum it up with is moronic. And the audience was about that age too, not one of the people i was with laughed like the audience but we are older and all have the ability to drive, that's probably what set us apart.The thing is, it isn't really pie in your face humor. It's if you blindly love jack black and worship his every facial expression humor, then you might find it funny.Don't get the wrong idea I love Jack Black, I also like Napoloen Dynamite, but this movie was not up to either's standards.For all of those people rating this a ten, I have a question....Are we watching the same movie?",Nacho Libre
223,cskjott,Great Comedy Applauded,10,25 October 2007,"This film is a must have for any comedy buff, free of lewdness, simple comedy in it's splendour with a great serving of sheer corniness, masterly devised.. and there's the delicate balance in terms of images and plot and characters which needs mention. It's all just well done.This comedy has two funny characters, but Jack Black shows outstanding genius in acting out in a way which seems to come perfectly natural to him and his performance comes off in that wicked and spontaneous way which is such a rare commodity in modern comedy.. Jack Black is consciously or not king of the Corny! Note how he handles a stooopid song in terms of expression! Fabulous. Hands down.I'm only posting this because ""NACHO LIBRE"" in every aspect needs to be repeated, not necessarily as a sequel, but I personally would like to see much more comedy with all the simple qualities Nacho Libre represents to me.I highly recommend this comedy to anyone, if you don't get it, watch it again and try to learn this type of comedy. I hope to see more and will definitely look out for Jack Black and everyone else on this film, in their next adventure looking forward to a real hearty laugh. Hats off!",Nacho Libre
224,SarkastikAssassin,Jack Black at his best,8,17 March 2018,"This movie is one of my all-time favorites and let me just say that it is SEVERELY underrated. 
It may not be anything too special, but this movie is incredibly fun to watch. It's funny, it's quotable, and to some it may even be inspiring. 
This movie would not be what it is if anyone played the lead other than Jack Black. He's one of my favorite comedians, and he's no worse in this movie than he was in School of Rock or Jumanji. Yes, he has a cheesy accent, and maybe the whole movie has a cheesy tone to it, but it's important to realize that this is a comedy movie. And from the standpoint of ""I just want to watch a funny movie that's enjoyable and will make me laugh,"" it accomplishes this very well. That's not to say this movie doesn't have flaws, but that's not why I'm typing this. It's a fantastic movie with a great ending, and despite what that 5/10 average score says, I love this picture to death.
Watch the movie yourself. It's freaking amazing.",Nacho Libre

226,tereranisharma,Not the best.,6,21 June 2006,"I didn't want to see this movie when I saw the previews. I didn't enjoy Napolean Dynamite, so I didn't think I would enjoy this either. But some of my friends pushed me to go watch it, so I gave in.This is a story about a friar (Jack Black) who cooks for the orphans. But he thinks that he is under-appreciated, and he also needs new spices for the food he makes. One day when he went to town, he saw a famous wrestler. He loved how the famous wrestler had big fame and made big money.So he decided to try out at a amateur wrestling match. But he needs a partner. He decided to choose a man who had stolen a bag of chips from him. So together they became Nacho and Esqueleto. They would lose matches, but still get paid big money because the crowd loved them. But soon the orphans and nuns find out. Nacho swears that he will win a match with the best wrestler. But he fails the first round, so he can not fight the best wrestler. Now Nacho is thrown out of the monastery. Now what does Nacho do? Well this story was kind of weird. Also the comedy was okay. But I think there are better movies out in theaters right now.",Nacho Libre
227,zengator,wow. just... wow.,1,24 July 2007,"Jack Black can usually make me snicker simply by breathing, but in this movie...Besides the direction, writing, lack of plot, constant mugging (aided and abetted by constant straight-on camera shots), and a .050 joke batting average, it was still an utter waste of time. The idea sounds promising, but what potential there was gets wasted with an utter lack of comedy and some of the worst direction I've seen this side of you-tube.I kept hearing that this film portrayed Mexicans very negatively. While that's no doubt true, I really don't think this movie is meant to be racist. I think that's it's more a result of a ""creative"" team desperately trying to find something funny in this mess. You can almost hear them crying out from behind the camera: ""Hey look, it's an ugly Mexican! Laugh, people! Please, for the love of all things tenacious, LAUGH!""But put the racism charges aside. When you get down to it, it's anyone who plunked down good money and time to watch this pile of leftover refried beans that should be offended, IMO.",Nacho Libre

229,heyuguys1988,Save your money,8,14 June 2006,"I hate to have to compare previous works but Jared Hess' original claim to fame, Napoleon Dynamite, even though not great, blows this out of the water. The thing about that movie was the charm that it had. It produced a level of charm that allowed for it to have a certain stupid humor. Most of all, extremely likable and somewhat realistic characters. Nacho Libre on the other hand, does not. They make too many fart/poop jokes (even a scene early on where someone has cow feces rubbed on their face) that even a fan of poop/fart jokes (really I am!) felt dumber watching it. There are scenes where fart sounds are inserted basically because with out them there, the scene would have been a little bit bland (which was one reason Napoleon Dynamite succeeded so well). This movie has nothing good to come out of it story wise. On the other hand, the film uses a vibrant color pallet fairly well. My only complaint was that after a while, it felt like too much and i was sick of it. Jack Black is funny... in other movies; his jokes here are lame and the same. I fear for Jared Hess' future; once a bright star in a galaxy filled with fading ones, now just seems to be another shooting star.",Nacho Libre

231,dejapka,Jack Black at his best,7,15 June 2006,"This is yet another unique film from Jared Hess the writer/director of Napoleon Dynamite. There are similar themes of adolescent alienation and the struggle for acceptance. Also similar is that the story takes place in an remote non-glamorous yet exotic location. Where the two films are dissimilar is in the performance of the lead actor. Jack Black shines in this role. This is the most understated performance I can recall of his career. And it works so well. He is hilarious without going overboard. His ability to communicate big humor from subtle body language makes this performance outstanding.The film contains everything one would expect in the sophomoric humor genre -- farts, boogers, and physical blows to the groin. Yet behind all of these comedic gestures is a meaningful story. Nacho, a young man enslaved to a dirt poor Mexican Catholic orphanage as a cook, changes in his life by using his athletic abilities. His ""success"" enables him to better the existence of the orphans and provides the children hope that life can be better.What is most incredible about this film is the positive portrayal of Mexican people. At a time when North Americans are closing their minds because of illegal immigration issues, here is a wonderful little film that celebrates the uniqueness of Mexico. Even though 50% of the dialog is in Spanish, no subtitles are needed for the comedy and story to shine through. The Mexican music adds to the cultural cornucopia. Hopefully the theaters across the United States will be filled with Caucasian adolescent boys who cheer for Nacho the downtrodden spirited Latino. This comedy crosses language and cultural differences while celebrating the similarity of youth.This may not be a film for everyone, but it is certainly entertaining.",Nacho Libre

There is a fair amount of good laughs and an entertaining story, but not as great as Napoleon Dynamite. I liked the fact that the film doesn't have the same tripe or innuendos as today's modern comedies.Jack Black does a fine job with his role, playing a very similar character to most of his other films. Black is good at what he does and doesn't seem to stray very far from what works. The Latin nun is fantastic in the film, looking just gorgeous and playing her role very well. The only other actors that were familiar to me were the movers in the beginning of the film, If you are a fan of Jack Black, then I'd recommend seeing this film, you'll probably enjoy it. But, if Jack Black isn't your cup of tea, then this may not be the film for you. In any case, if you do see it, I hope you enjoy it. Thanks for reading,",Nacho Libre
234,hirapcute_me,good but not as good as other jack black's film,6,26 April 2008,"okay.. it's pretty obvious that this film is not that good, but at least it did exceed my expectations..I know that the only good film J.Black ever had was School of Rock but still I'm open to the idea that he is a good comedian. In this film he again showed his versatility in comedy, acting, and singing which fits quite nice to his role.. But one things' sure, J.Black is not fit yet, for a solo role..So much for J.Black, let's go into the film itself. The film Nacho Libre is by nature boring and corny but the good thing about it is that roles of each character fit quite nice to the actors/actresses that played the roles. The Demi Moore Penelope Cruz look-a-like Ana dela Reguera possessed a innocent charm that showcase an image of a nun. J.Black a funny talented guy, looked a lot like the present days friar(monk, i think?) and it's really nice.So for all those who are expecting a high quality comedy film, I could say this is not for you people. Nacho Libre is a feel good movie with fun characters and cool story line.

The movie is overflowing with stupidity; everything from fart sounds, to fat people in extremely tight clothes, to scenes that simply made no sense. The portrayal of Spanish culture, although in the spirit of humor, is actually quite insulting and derogatory. All the sounds in the movie are also noticeably dubbed, and this includes voices.

The Napoleon Dynamite meets Monk in Wrestling tights is funny for all of two seconds and that might be overstating this movie's more humorous aspects.Not that I ever thought Jack Black was the funniest man alive, but he has shown the ability to turn on a reasonable amount of comic charm in the past, but alas, he's no funnier than George Will in this one.

And even I'll admit I didn't get what the big deal was about Napoleon Dynamite, I thought it was purposefully lame, but not lame enough to make a person laugh. Great movie for the budget though. I have an entertainment value for movies these days, and this film gets a ""9/10"" just for making me laugh. Some good quality repeatable lines, ""Take et eazzzzy"" ""I know a buttload of crap about the Gospel"" and ""How did you find me? I saw you from the village (about three yards away.)"" That's it.

I consider this to be his best performance so far because it shows his versatility as an actor. He is animated, witty, random, clumsy, flimsy, passionate, and vivacious. Not only he is all this, but he is all this in a demanding role (not to mention faking an accent). The chemistry with Hector Jimenes is good and they are a duo splendid to watch. Having said that, the movie leaves much to be desired. The setting, 1970s urban Mexico, is interesting but there is nothing more to it. The storyline could be way better and some of the characters distracted from the movie (which revolves around Nacho's desire to wrestle). The plot is unoriginal and so is the script, with the exception of some funny dialogs (funny in the sense that they are random and out of place). If you are not a Jack Black fan, it's harder to appreciate the movie in its whole and Black's versatility. It is the sort of movie you would only see once and you might as well wait to rent the DVD/. If you are a Jack Black fan, you will be thrilled. But judging the movie as a whole, I give it a 6.",Nacho Libre
240,Mpup54,Hector Jimenez shows star potential in a supporting role,9,8 September 2009,"I avoided this film for 3 years before I saw it take me by surprise. The commercials definitely didn't represent this movie very well and that is what steered me away initially. I caught it on TV a few years later and got hooked on one surprisingly good performance...not Jack Black's.I never realized the brilliance of Hector Jimenez (Steve, Esqueleto) until I saw him act in this. Every line he delivered in this movie was downright hilarious and memorable for quoting, even all the way down to a simple word or sound (oooOOOoooh).In my eyes, Esqueleto played his comedic role to perfection while Jack Black sort of fished around for his moments of stale comedy. Nobody had really seen the likes of Jimenez and it was definitely more than a case of a role simply fitting a person.Esqueleto stole the show by delivering his lines in a manner like the world has never seen. because he his first depicted as a street bum, food stealing renegade, the anticipation of his line delivery caught me off guard. He is freaking hilarious.Typing the lines here does him no justice. Yes, many of the lines themselves are funny but its the way in which he approaches them and the manner in which he emphasizes certain words in these lines. Add to that an almost effeminate tone and cartoon-like physicality and you get one of the most hilarious side characters of all time.I hope Hector goes on to do great things, he may not get a lead character role, but ill take all the future supporting cast roles that he can find his way into.This movie would not be half as good without Hector Jimenez itn it.",Nacho Libre

246,Blotkey,Overuse of rejected Napoleon Dynamite Humor,3,17 June 2006,"The publicity of this movie will get to you. Hot Topic clothing, magnets, keychains, were out instores even before this movie came out, the directors desperately thinking that Nacho Libre is the next Napoleon Dynamite. I swear, they could've saved a whole lotta money for a entirely better cause.Between deciding to watch Cars and Nacho Libre, my friends and I debated to watch Nacho Libre, due to the fact that the director of School of Rock was involved. We love Jack Black too and I consider Napoleon D to be a great movie in its own unique way.But after watching Nacho Libre, we all decided it was a waste of our time and we could've been watching a more thought-out written, funny, and interesting movie instead.If you've watched Napololeon Dynamite, you will know the punchline and what happens next in every sad attempt of a joke. It's like they decided to use up the rejected jokes of Napoleon Dynamite. Seating in our seats, I noticed that after almost every joke we had the expression of ""...Was that supposed to be funny? I'll just wait...It'll probably get better soon."" But it didn't. I ended up being half asleep and wishing I could just get up and leave, but my faith in Jack Black's acting made me stay.There wasn't a major climax in this film at all, the problems the characters come up against are solve too easily and just come their way.The songs were good, and one song kept showing up in parts of the movie. I liked it but the film's themes didn't have an impact on me at all to be moved by the songs.I found some characters to have personalities totally randomly scraped together. There were rare parts scattered around the movie that made me laugh out loud, yet Napoleon Dynamite kept me constantly laughing throughout. Jack Black is a great choice to be in this idea for a film, but the WRITING and PLOT just made this film crash.I know for this kind of humor, you're supposed to know overanalyze things and hope for that Hollywood movie kinda dialogue. One of the major reasons Napoleon Dynamite will be compared as much better than Nacho Libre is that even if both pairs of main characters are the underdogs in both films, you feel like you can more relate to the main pair of Napoleon and his new friend, Pedro.The ending left me unsatisfied, with a very lame scenic view. I kept thinking, ""No way...This cannot be the ending."" and in some parts I thought it would be good to just end the movie right there.I highly, highly, recommend to just RENT this movie to watch Jack Black.

Second, wrestling is stupid, fake, gay, and anyone who likes it is stupid trope. They left out the ""redneck"" part out and replaced it with Mexican(clever).Without going into detail as to why this movie is culturally wrong on so many levels, I'll keep it short. This movie is a big joke you're either in on or not. It's literally making fun of your culture and you're not understanding it, or like me you totally ""get it"".Lastly, Jack Black isn't cool or funny either. His band isn't cool and in all of his movies he comes off trying way too hard(someone will try to say I'm trying too hard replying to my review). He ends up looking like the comic book guy from the Simpsons. In reality that character has more depth and is cooler than Jack Black.",Nacho Libre

I don't feel this is entirely accurate. I came into the cinema without huge expectations (being that it's a Nickelodeon film, and undoubtedly silly). I expected that Jack Black would pretty much just do his regular thing - this time in tights (which he did) and that the story would involve some wacky/ ugly characters (which it did).It had a few funny moments, but I didn't feel this made up for the lack of content and exposition. And am I the only one who would like to see more of something else from Jack Black??Napoleon Dynamite relied on quirky characters as well, without actually explaining much about their motivations. Nacho Libre seemed to have even less explanations! A few characters appear repeatedly in the film without any exposition about them or their relationship to Nacho. There also seemed to be a lack of dramatic tension to drive the story. Instead, the film appears to progress out of habit than the characters' necessity.The verdict: mildly amusing way to pass an hour or so, but would not be on my ""must buy"" list!",Nacho Libre

Very jerky movie. One scene that comes to mind is the one where he scales a mountain, eats a bird egg, and then jumps (or falls) into the water. What??? Where's the rest of it? I kept waiting for the mother eagle to come and poke his eye out or pull down his stretchy-pants. Not that that would have improved the scene but I was left ""unfulfilled"". This experience has reminded me of why I always do extensive research before I see a movie: I hate wasting my time and I hate wasting my money.",Nacho Libre
250,MPFourEedz,Funniest Movie in a LONG LONG Time,10,6 October 2006,"Let me start by saying Nacho Libre is extremely funny movie. Don't expect twist and turns, its a straight up comedy which movie comedy fans will enjoy.I hadn't laughed that hard in a long time. I can appreciate people not being too into it. It requires a certain type of humor for it to be truly appreciated.Weeks after watching it, my mate and I where still saying lines from the movie, in that awesome accent Jack Black puts on for this movie.""But I can not reveal my face Steven come on"" LOL Solid Gold Jack Black I applaud you, this movie is unbelievably funny for my taste.Go out and watch.",Nacho Libre
251,m00nd4ddy,underrated classic,10,5 May 2020,"I might be a little biased to say how much of a great movie it is as this was my childhood! But having to rewatch it after a long time, it positively still cracked me up. Other than its easy going pace and humor, i absolutely loved other technical parts of it. The camera work, color grading (that reminds me of Wes Anderson), and transitions. Don't be fooled to judge by the number of negative reviews it has and just give it a chance yourself!",Nacho Libre

Sure this is one of my childhood favorites so I watched it a lot when I was younger and looking back on it it's still hilarious. I think this might be Jack Black at his best and I mean it. All the jokes are hilarious and oh god, this movie is quotable. Me and my family quote this movie on a daily basis whether it's ""I need to borrow some sweaaaatssss"", or ""They are the lords chips"", etc...This movie still holds up as on of the funniest of all time. Dare I say it? I think it's even better than Napoleon Dynamite. And if you like that movie the chances are you'll love this one.",Nacho Libre

254,joshbutters,More like Nacho Stinko,1,11 February 2007,"I rented this movie a few weeks ago because it seemed like a comedy, and most of the movies I watch nowadays are comedy anyways, so why not give it a try? The problem is, I don't think I laughed once throughout the movie. The movie is basically about this guy that serves food in this small Mexican town (I think)and also dreams of becoming a Mexican professional wrestler named, you guessed it, Nacho Libre. So he comes up with this crazy wrestling outfit and gets this other guy to be his tag team partner. I guess I did laugh once at his wrestling outfit because it looked incredibly stupid, but that was it. They go on to lose to a bunch of weird wacky wrestling teams then at the end *spoilers* they beat this one team. That's it. Whoopdeedoo. I don't recommend this film, unless you really like wrestling then you might like it.",Nacho Libre
255,lisawall,"Very Sweet, Hilarious Film",10,20 June 2006,"This was a very sweet and funny film. I did not find it a bit offensive to the Latin culture. Jack Black's character was very endearing because of his love for the orphans. It is refreshing to see a film that is very funny without foul language and nudity. Humor without shock value. What a concept!!!! Kids can go see this and both them and their parents will love it. I can't wait for Hess's next film. Jack Black is at the top of his game here. Hess's previous work, Napoleon Dynamite, was funny in the same fashion. It is true humor when you can laugh when no words are being spoken. Hess has found his ""real"" talent; finding the best actors to fit the parts. Jack Black and Jon Heder were the best choices for the title characters in their respective films. Hess is on his way to the top.",Nacho Libre

As there were many differences between nacho and napoleon there were a few things here and there that seemed fimlilliar. I thought the movies was pretty damn funny. Its all about the delivery of the lines. If any one else were casted as Nacho this movie would of been horrible. But its like they have JB a sweet stache, pimpin hair and said ""talk with a Mexican accent"" then rolled the cameras which equals laughs for me. Also there were really random things in the movie that weren't even explained in the plot which i thought was really funny. But pretty much its allllll about Jack blacks performance, its gold.

Delightful. Totally heartwarming. Quirky, beautiful, and slightly surreal. The fun, hip visual design and fantastic soundtrack are a feast for the senses. These plus the warmth and lovable innocence of the story transcend the slapstick humor....yet the over-the-top silliness, as delivered by Jack Black and cast, is really hilarious. I was reminded somewhat of favorite quirky movies from the 60's-70's (Like Harold and Maude), and more recently the Wes Anderson movies (Tenenbaums, Bottle Rocket, Rushmore, Aquatic Life) and was even reminded of that beautiful kind of psychedelic Romeo and Juliet with Leonardo and Claire Danes. Now that I've seen this I am definitely going to see Napoleon Dynamite. Usually slapstick type humor, and crude humor, doesn't appeal to me, and I have absolutely no interest in pro wrestling. Yet the combined elements of Nacho Libre really made me smile, laugh (and, strangely, tears came inexplicably streaming down my face at one point. Did it happen to you, too? This movie is more than just hilarious satire, it touches something in your heart.) Jack Black and all the cast are incredible. Thoroughly enjoyable, leaves you smiling.",Nacho Libre

A lead role for Jack Black and what a role it is... I laughed so hard, I almost started too cry... Jack has always been funny in supporting roles, but he hit it right on this time as a lead... It's a black cult comedy, the story is slim, but so was Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore, the cast is great, you will love the sidekick Esqueleto. He is hilarious... I loved it, the best comedy in a long time... Napoleon was black comedy, but not funny, the director shows here that he got the skill. We know what you're up to!!! DR GONZO",Nacho Libre
260,DeyeJoe,The ONE to Watch: Héctor Jiménez,7,7 July 2006,"Alright, so I'm a bit biased, having recently served as Camera Operator on another film co- starring Héctor Jiménez.... Killer Pad... The hardest part of that job was trying not to ruin the sound takes with my explosive laughter!Héctor has a great sense of physical comedy, reminiscent of Charles Chaplin... his mere appearance on screen is bemusing.Overall, Nacho Libre shares this same kind of comic simplicity: it plays out as if the actors are on stage, relying on their own sense of timing, rather than using editing techniques to set the pace of the humor ... Jared Hess definitely understands this approach to comedy.... it is what gives Napoleon Dynamite its on-screen power.There is a very encouraging message carried in the writing of Nacho Libre that does not overshadow the humor. The story is simple, the characters are equally uncomplicated, yet they are respectively sincere and sympathetic. It makes for a charming, warm and enjoyable ""feel good"" experience. Yes, Jack Black carries the day as the movie's ""Hero,"" but I guarantee you'll be laughing harder at Héctor! He's the One to Watch in this film.",Nacho Libre
261,pnmsb03,A Disappointingly Dumb Movie!,4,28 July 2006,"The film is about some sort of priest who feeds orphans, and he likes this new nun there. Nacho, the priest (Jack Black), starts fighting for an unclear reason, and the nun tells him he must do it for a helpful reason in order for him to be forgiven. So Nacho fights for the orphans with some guy who he was once fighting, and then they suddenly became friends. This movie was only positive due to Jack Black being in it, and it certainly wasn't too entertaining. And of course like in all Nickelodeon movies, they must have a farting part and a kick in that place you know because it always happens. It was a silly, disorganized and humiliating movie, and I agree with another person who said it was a cheap Napoleon Dynamite. I wish I had seen Cars twice after this film. It deserves nothing more than a four out of ten though others disagree. You learn nothing positive from it and get nothing positive either.",Nacho Libre

It was sick, weird, and not to mention we had this freak that would laugh at everything Jack Black said, I mean if he just said...""Hola amigo"" you could hear this screech but it sounded like a chuckle at the same time, that kinda ruined the movie's vibe. There were some parts that I got laugh out of, but I still think it was mostly retarded! I think Jack Black is a really funny guy and this movie didn't make him seem as funny as he is. It's actually quite sad! And just....ah I don't I just really don't like this movie! Don't SEE IT!!",Nacho Libre

Jack Black may at times go over the top but he more than makes up for it with some moments of real genius. Besides the obvious jokes there's an intelligent, awkward humor here for those who look for it. Some critics are saying the plot is too predictable. C'mon. This is often an issue with critics trying to take storytelling in comedies too seriously. If a comedy succeeds in making you laugh all the way through, who the heck cares? Were you going to this movie to feel suspense or to pee your pants laughing? If the latter, you'll love this film.",Nacho Libre

Great performance by Jack Black, although the one negative point is that i don't think he should have sung. I think he should have just done straight comedic acting. The singing thing brings people out of the movie and back to the fact that this is Jack Black and not that character. His side kick was perfectly funny. His smile was priceless. the main girl? Didn't really talk, just sort of stood around and looked hot. Could have used to see more skin though.Well done all you rich movie making people out there.",Nacho Libre

This movie uses a location, Mexico, where Latinos are the majority group. You can not call Jack Black racist for portraying a Mexican priest/luchador, and especially not the other actors to be racist against Latinos, because they ARE Latinos.Also, most reports of people I know saying this movie is racist, have not seen it, or REFUSE to see it because ""It is a racist movie, and you can tell from the trailers that if you see this movie, you hate Mexicans"".

But on the bright-side, the movie is witty, warm, and funny. Jack Black tries to do a Mexican accent, but you can tell he's really American.

268,dan-desjardins-1,Argh!,3,2 September 2006,The plot appears to have the promise of something funny - but outside of the fact that the Monk wants to be a wrestler none of it really develops into a memorable or particularly funny movie. There were so many sub-plots introduced that go nowhere that I have to believe there was some indiscriminate editing going on - like seeing Airport 77 edited by Delta Airlines. I like Jack Black - he strikes me as a comedian with the potential to emerge from a great script with a very popular following - but this was not a great script and the movie is only entertaining at a very superficial level. The ongoing tension with the nun just didn't work. This could have been written to be a girl from the village and it certainly would have worked better. I can not believe the writers never considered that - unless they never actually finished the script and let the filmmaker run out of film.,Nacho Libre

The sad part is, it didn't deliver... it just DID NOT. I could overlook the fact that it's a rip-off from Andersons style of film-making--which is too obvious--but I couldn't overlook the fact that it's a rip-off from an avante-gard in comedy films, but still didn't quite succeed. Andersons films are innovative and smart, is this movie supposed to be those things too??? I think NOT. What hurts me the most is that it stars Jack Black. He's on OK guy for me. He's really got something to offer. The script could have made it, if it wasn't for the director's lack of originality and good-comedic-timing. The film tried too hard to be a ""Rushmore"", or a ""Napoleon Dynamite"". The film was so disappointing. There is not one funny scene in the thing. I'm sorry to all Jack Black fans.

There were a few pacing problems....and some of the plot just had some mechanical issues with logic... But if you are into that zany mindset then by all means go check it out...pure escapist silliness. The audience that I saw it with really got into it too....could be a cool cult comedy film!

I enjoyed every other movie I ever saw him in, and generally seem to think what he thinks if funny generally is funny. This was a massive exception.The saddest thing about it was that Jack Black tried so hard! He really did! He put everything he could into this role! Sadly, it sucked. Among the things that sucked most about this movie: The pacing. It was odd, eratic, weird, and just generally bad. Made the movie far worse than it would have been.The characters were horrendous. There were no characters. Just characatures. They reacted exactly as you would expect them to. And thats it.I enjoy a decent summer blockbuster leave-your-brain-at-the-door flick. but this was taking that to the extreme. really, attempt to simulate the brain functions of an amoeba, and then you may think a few things are funny. maybe. although it was still be a bit low brow. For god's sake, just don't let the question ""why"" get anywhere near your head though.Truly, we watched for about an hour, and could stand no more. We ended up crashing ""The Breakup"", which was actually pretty decent.Honestly, i think this is the movie Jack Black is going to look back on and regret. Best to have it out of the way now though.",Nacho Libre

He wants to help the orphans and does so by wrestling. He is not a good wrestler and loses, but he still gets money for losing.

And yes, I agree with what someone said earlier, although it may seem like silly humor, there is an actual intelligence about it that makes it even more enjoyable!"" It is a quaint little comedy, very laid back. I went with lots of expectations and i hated the movie too at the start as well as my friends. We felt the jokes were very far and few between. It was just not explosive at all. However being Jack Black fans we watched it again by chance and surprisingly, it is now one of the most charming movie i know. It gives me hope to run after my dreams. How do you handle that. Very laid back but it actually inspires you. Seems dull but has the most lovely soundtrack. Even a bit romantic too.People who rushes through movies as if they are walking on a city street wont like it. But someone who takes time as if they are walking on the countryside will appreciate its slowness. Its a little sad and sweet but at the same time hilarious too. Something very interesting is i laughed more when saw it the second time, then more the third time and now I love this movie. People are time and again reminded to kill expectations when they watch a movie but even after they try, unconsciously they bring this baggage along. So its a bummer. Happened with me when i watched this movie too. What happened when I watched this again is -my expectations were automatically set that I knew it is going to be a laid back, slow entertainer. Thats how i am enjoying it and i don't watch it on busy days or so called ""weekends"" when you want to have fun.

After approximate 10 minutes watching this flick I was already crouching my legs thinking about the money I paid for the tickets. I asked my wife if is possible to ask for the money back and she said yes but she wouldn't allow me so I had to swallow. I was bored and nervous watching a film that would make no sense.

Jack Black has completely proved he has no talent for comedy, or anything even remotely related to laughter. He should be working somewhere as a janitor, and this film should be taken out with the garbage. It was actually painful to watch this film. Honestly, this film should be added to the top ten worse films of all time. What should be a 3 minute skit has been hacked into a full length, beyond stupid bore. You keep waiting for the comedy to begin, but it doesn't happen. The acting is terrible, the storyline is weak and the humor isn't funny.I have never seen a comedy with Jack Black in it that was funny. It's just the same boring crap with this guy. I did see his performance in Kong as a possible ray of light wherein he played a very serious role. I'm not saying he can act, but I would need to see more of him in these roles. I will never watch another Jack Black wannabe comedy again.And to the producers, writers and director... what were you smoking? What were you thinking? This movie wasn't released, it escaped.

There are some nice visuals but this is supposed to be a comedy, not a nominee for best director. Don't waste your time with this one.I really hate to put such a bad review for a Jack Black movie but this movie truly deserves it. If you like Jack Black go see 'Shallow Hal' or 'School of Rock'.

Jack Black deserves an Oscar just for his mannerisms. It is original & fairly clean & doesn't resort to ridiculous Will Ferrell toilet humour, how anyone finds that guy funny is beyond me, but as I said each to their own. Brilliant, very funny film.

With the exception of Nacho, we learn very little about the other characters. Fortunately, Jack Black's portrayal of the main character is engaging enough to carry the film. Many of the negative comments point out that there were no memorable lines. This is true. There is however, dialog, sight gags, and the expressions of the actors, especially Jack Black's. There is something about this guy that allows him to take a bland line and turn it into something entertaining.Some have accused this of bashing the Catholic Church. I didn't see it. Others claim that this is offensive to Mexicans. Again, I didn't see it. In fact, while it does show that these people are not as well off as we are in the United States, it portrays Mexicans (for the most part) as a group of honest and hardworking people. By the way, Nacho's accent reminded me of ""The Spaniard"" from The Princess Bride.As for kids, the only things that I found objectionable were the fart-jokes and the scenes where Nacho was speaking from the other side of a bathroom stall (with somewhat inappropriate sound effects). My eight year-old daughter, who picked this movie, (probably because she was constantly bombarded by ads on the Nickelodeon Channel) was entertained, and I did not feel that she was exposed to anything harmful. When I asked here what her favorite part of the movie was, she just shrugged, even though her eyes had been glued to the screen from start to finish.Conclusion: No catch phrases. Just a nice, albeit imperfect, film that is well acted and well directed. It is fine for kids, unless you think that The Disney Channel goes too far some times.",Nacho Libre

If you want existential problems analyzed and pondered, go watch a German movie where there is lots of gray snow and subtitles. If you want something that tackles tough social problems, go see the latest Paul Haggis endeavor. If you want something fun, go see Nacho Libre.A protagonist starts out doing something selfish and by the end of the movie realizes it's better to act with altruism and nobility: This is not a new storyline. So what. Jack Black's facial expressions and turns of phrases along with great writing and directing make this movie worth seeing.Ten yrs ago this role would've gone to Jim Carey and 15 yrs ago it would've gone to Robin Williams, but I can't imagine either one of them coming close to the hilarious job Jack Black does.Go see this movie if you want something that'll make you smile.",Nacho Libre

(think- 21 Jump Street and the swearing....it really isn't that funny)I have been ready to give up on movies all together...then I came across this movie. The movie relies on actually having a story....the silliness of Jack Black, and actually treats women with respect. It was sweet, funny and not the least bit offensive.

Maybe they expected to see Jack Black as he appeared in King Kong? Or Jack Black as he appeared in Hi Fidelity? I thought the movie was funny because of the intense desire Black portrayed at becoming a ""great wrestler."" There is an odd Peter Sellers Cato duality with his co-star that I found endearing. Also the way Black preens in the ""Stretchy pants"" is hilarious. All the little nuances of the movie made it funny and how they moved from being slapstick to subtly gave the movie an off-balance feel. I never knew where it was heading and that is another reason I liked it. We didn't know if Ignacio was going to get the girl. We never even knew if they were ever going to win a wrestling match.

We were very pleasantly surprised. Nacho Libre was hilarious and the story was very sweet. More like a fairy tale that could have been set anywhere. I thought it was very clever how at first we are led to believe the story is set in a small Mexican village 100 years ago, but then we are shown the luxury resort and the sprawling city nearby.

It's a theme I've seen too many times, (guy overcoming ridiculous odds to help the less fortunate) and bottom line I just didn't think it was very funny. Kids are cute, the actress playing the sister is beautiful (almost too beautiful) but when the action is not in the ring, nothing very funny happens.

Maybe it is because the movie's sensibilities are so out of focus that I didn't get it? I attended this movie with a ten-, fourteen-, and seventeen-year old set of minors, and I expected the slap-sticky humor and crude laugh prompts. But I did not expect the story line, scene content and characterizations to reach this level of ethnic slurring. It betrays the ignorance of the writers/producers/director. It serves only to perpetuate the stereotyping and ethnic slurs that have been directed against Mexicans for as long as I can remember. Jack Black's accent is insulting, not funny. I am less of an admirer of his work after sitting through this awful waste of money, so typical of too many Hollywood miscreations. With all the ways there are to make us laugh, why this group of lost boys has put all this energy into this film is beyond me. That it is doing so well at the box is an even sadder testimony.

295,godzooky-1,a heartwarming story with a little humor,8,17 June 2006,"I went and saw Nacho Libre with some of my friends. And I was actually pleasantly surprised. Let me start off by saying if you saw Napoleon Dynamite forget about it, this is a different movie, with an actual plot. Now that we got that out of the way, to put it simple, this movie is a story of a man trying to make a change for him and his orphans, and win the love of the woman of his dreams. As we follow his story you may or may not laugh along the way, but your kids certainly will. I guess so many people bad-mouthed this movie because they expected something more, or just because it's done by the same director of Napoleon Dynamite. But I look at it as nothing more than a good, clean family-oriented movie that's just a little out of the ordinary with beautifully painted settings characters. So if you find yourself bored on a rainy day, and you can't take your kids outside and play, take'em out to see this movie, you won't regret it. It's rated PG but I can think of only 2 scenes that could possibly not be suitable, one involving fecal matter(just stupid, not absurd), and one with crazy midget wrestlers that may be a little scary for kids under 6 or 8.

I thought the movie was, well, charming in a way so few American movies are these days (you've got your stock ""Action"" flicks, your stock ""Romantic Comedy"" flicks, blah, blah--cookie cutters). I highly approve of original movies, especially original comedies, especially funny original comedies when most American made stuff seems so formulaic.

302,riseley,Attack Of The New And Improved Formula Movie,4,20 June 2006,"We can only guess the conversation between husband and wife writing team Jared and Jerusha Hess went something like this, ""Holy smokes honey, our agent says he can sell whatever we want and make a big studio movie with a real movie star!"" ""But I'm only good at writing about uncomfortable people from a peculiar subculture as I did with our hit film Napoleon Dynamite."" ""Well, in Mexico, where went on my mission to spread our church's interesting version of history, I became familiar with Catholicism and the quaint luchador wrestling sport. I also have watched many many grainy Mexican movies and I think that I can successfully mimic their hyper dramatic style to humorous effect."" ""Well, by adding several fart jokes and some beans coming out of Jack Black's nose, I think I can write a great script that will be both funny, racist and insulting to Mexicans."" ""We're from Utah, honey, people expect us to be insulting to Mexicans!"" ""This is gonna be awesome, where's my sweet new laptop?"" Yes folks, beans come out of Jack Black's nose for a gag and a laugh. Hey, I too found Napoleon Dynamite charming. Please don't read this and tell me, ""Well, you just don't get that special humor."" No, I know what was supposed to be funny and a great deal of this movie just wasn't.It looks like Jared and Jerusha Hess are now stealing jokes from Garrison Keillor. I did not write this down in the theater (as it was dark and boring in there) but Jack Black, who plays Nacho, the friar slash aspiring wrestler, is showing the lovely Sister Encarnación a photo of his parents and he says something like, ""My mother was a Lutheran Missionary, my father was a Mexican Catholic. They wanted to convert each other but got married instead."" You scream: Hey, that's not a funny thing to put in your review, Chris.I answer: Well, it wasn't funny when I paid full price to see it in the movie theater either! From the way I sound, you'd think I was going to give this thing one star and be done with it. But I can't. Jack Black, fumbling through his hideously inconsistent attempt at a Mexican accent, saves the experience a little bit. I can suffer through some really stupid fart jokes just to see how Jack's going to deliver the next line.What I don't get is how he can team up with Nickelodeon and make a movie obviously only a ten year old can enjoy, after creating songs like ""Fluck Her Gently,"" the animated video for which depicts him and his Tenacious D partner teaching the devil how to love his women more kindly, in extremely hard core animation.Maybe some people are going to applaud Jared and Jerusha for making a straight PG feature full of all kinds of family values. I would applaud them if that is what they had done. But they didn't. They might think they did but when they cast the lovely Ana de la Reguera in the role of a nun, they hardly had family values on their mind. Jack Black's character Nacho does not have family values on his mind when he meets her. He has wonderful sex on his mind as would anyone who sees this attractive Ana. Instead of asking her for hot sex, Jack invites her up his room to eat toast. This was of course probably intended as humor. Two people in the crowded theater that I was watching in laughed. They also laughed at the fart jokes and the part in which Nacho rubs feces over the face of his side kick Esqueleto.Bringing up Esqueleto reminds me of another thing this movie does right: Casting. I concede that it is beautifully cast. If not for the excellent faces in this movie it would be a total loss. So yes, I liked looking at the faces. Nacho has a fan who sits in the front row of the wrestling matches, he has the cross eyed kind of quirkiness that Ingmar Bergman would have included in a much better movie than this one. But Ingmar would have helped us see his eccentricities and peculiarities as endemic of the human condition. Jared Hess has nowhere near this depth. When he uses ugly people there can be no mistaking this: he is ridiculing them. Case in point: the big fat girl who tries to pull Esqueleto through an enormous rat hole in the wall of a nice home. A fat woman who uses rat holes to roam her own home? Fat? Rat? Get it? Fat people are like rats. That's the message here. Ugly people exist for the amusement of the rest of us. Hooray for Jared. I'm giving this movie three stars, so by all means, go and have a peek, but ask yourself when you see the parade of ugly people, are we laughing at them, or with them? You will see yourself back on the elementary school playground, led by Jared, laughing at the deformities of others.",Nacho Libre

This movie, however, takes pretentious to a whole new level.The director apparently somehow found himself with a hit on his hands with the terribly unfunny Napoleon Dynamite, and then got to make this.The jokes are probably funny through a haze of marijuana smoke, but once you are no longer stoned, you realize that they're really not funny at all and you get angry for wasting 2+ hours of your life. The casting is done in such a way as if to make sure that every single character is completely devoid of ANY acting capability. This includes Jack's partner, with whom he has to interact most of the time. Then there's the main love interest. The director chose to have her look angelic and innocent for the entire movie, honestly folks, she does absolutely nothing but sit there in the middle of the frame for the entire movie.Then there's the cinematography. About 75% of the movie is comprised of 3/4s shots with camera under lock down. Dollies and booms simply do not exist in Mexico.Welp, this goes to show you, any idiot with an accidental 'hit' can make it in Hollywood.

Boring....The movie has two story lines that intertwine, one affecting the other. I appreciate the idea, but the execution was poor.

The freak with the bad teeth was great, a better sidekick than Pedro. There wasn't much of a plot, but was there one in Napoleon. That is the directors only downnfall because no matter how funny a movie is, there mnust be some structure and you can make more laughs through capitilaizing on conflict resoulution, climax etc. But the cinematography and camera angles were innovative just like Dynamite and this director really makes his protagonists such losers that you fall in love with them.

Here is the impossible: a silver screen comedy for a broad spectrum of viewers that is innovative yet knowledgeable about the history of the genre, silly yet grounded in real life settings and concerns, over- the-top yet punctuated with subtlety, self-parodying but mindful of the audience. I believe this movie was made by people who grew up knowing/learning how to find humor in the moment, and then knowing/learning when and how to share it. This means Jack Black and Jared Hess but I'm sure there are others responsible. Bravo!Attend this movie for the realism of people and places of Oxaca state in Mexico. Or just enjoy it as a musical with Pythonesque lyrics to original songs which creates a great, perhaps unintentional, American Idol parody coupled with the best Danny Elfman score in a long time. Or analyze it for ""Is it a satire or is it not?"" view of the whole professional wrestling field of entertainment. Perhaps it was time for a light-hearted version of the ""Rocky"" story - is this it or is this a shameless put-down? Regardless of the expectation, you, we, they will emerge from this movie with memories - a song, a laugh, a stunt, an image, a perception, a concern for orphans.

You know what would have been a funnier gag here? Anything! Anything is funnier than nothing. Or how about the insanely tired gag where Nacho's partner agrees to bring some men to pretend to jump Nacho in the street, so he can pretend to beat them up and impress the pretty nun (who by the way is a completely undeveloped and superfluous character). What do you suppose happens here? Nacho attacks the wrong guys and gets his ass kicked. Did you see that coming? Congratulations! You are now a professional Hollywood screenwriter! Or when Nacho goes to tend to a sick man, he arrives and the man appears dead, so Nacho places coins over his eyes and performs a brief memorial service. But surprise!!! The guy is not dead!! He wakes up and the coins fall off and that is the end of the scene. He doesn't say anything, there is no punchline...the scene just ends...abruptly. There are no transitions between sequences at all. One sloppy punchline is jammed jarringly right up against the next lazy set-up.

In comparison, Napoleon Dynamite was average and Nacho Libre was pathetic.Don't waste a penny on this movie because you are unlikely to enjoy it at all unless you are under the influence of certain substances; and let me tell you now: you may still wish you had watched a chick flick with your most annoying ex-girlfriend instead.",Nacho Libre

They're just not there if you're not open for them. Same counts for Jack Black movies you either love him or you just don't get or even notice his jokes. Then, you're just thinking too seriously about this movie and maybe about life.Typical Jack Black movies, or better yet JB characters make me think of the legendary Cheech and Chong. Although NObody will get to their level and moreover get away with it, Jack Black is getting half way there.Why is it such a great movie? Two nobodies starting a wrestle tag team the first living in a monastery and the second living on the streets. Both of them don't even look like athletes. Jack Black singing ridiculous lyrics. Jack Black playing yet again a NObody who is nevertheless is full of confidence. And last but not least: Jack's Mexican accent is SO bad that it's hilarious! (""Read some books, children"") It makes me think of Inspector Clouseau's bad French accent played by Peter Sellers.",Nacho Libre

If you are a Jack Black fan I would highly recommend not watching this movie.It's not funny, the jokes are lame and worst of all you can't really understand what Jack Black's character is saying! It's just such a shame. It flopped at the movies here in Australia and there is no wonder.I spent a lot of the movie waiting for it to actually pick up and become interesting. In fact some parts are so boring I almost slipped into a coma a few times. They have a good plot for a movie - but for some reason or other it just didn't come together as you would expect.I normally give movies a second chance but this one really take the cake for worst movie ever made.

It is an hour and a half that I will never get back. The only reason I did not give it a 1 rating is because Jack Black sang and the female lead was beautiful. If you want to see a better movie with Jack Black in it, pick any one of his other movies. So if you find yourself at the video store and this movie and Gigli are the only movies in, pick this one. But if you have any other choices go with them. Jack Black is so much better in High Fidelity. That is the movie you should choose if you want to see Mr.Black in a good movie that is actually funny. Also there is School of Rock. But if you have to see this movie you might as well take your three dollars, place it in an envelope, and throw it away.",Nacho Libre

I think he isn't an actor at all, he is more like a ""town's clown"" in Hollywood, and some guys following him with cameras, and when they have enough footage, they just edit it to 90 minutes.

Ever month or two people ask for a good movie to watch with their youth group that is entertaining and clean and Nacho Libre gets thrown out there every time, by several people, and not always the same people... I had never watched it and wanted to know what was so endearing about this movie to so many people that work with teenagers. So I finally watched it...It was slow, the story seemed just made up as they went, the action wasn't very exciting, the comedy was not very funny (I laughed maybe once the whole movie), it was just a mess of a movie and I fail to see how it was endearing at all.My kids watched the movie and the only part they found funny was the times of farting...Sorry, it just wasn't very good, but I'll give it two starts because at least it wasn't raunchy humor.",Nacho Libre

Jack Black delivers the humor that you know him for. I really expected nothing from this movie, but with all the advertising it was a must see for my 12 year old and I. The theater was packed with ages from 9 years of age to 50 years of age and EVERYONE was laughing out loud! This movie will not disappoint if you go into it with an open mind to laugh.",Nacho Libre

Sure it didn't have a plot but ya know, Napolean Dynamite is an acquired taste. At least that's what I think anyway. Not for everyone.Can I say the same thing for Nacho Libre? Sure. Jack Black plays this cook at a monastery that wants to initially wrestle for the vanity of it all. He looks up to famous wrestler Ramses and wants to be like him. Then he meets Sister Incarnacion who is hot and he kinda sorta wants to get with her but can't since he's like, in a monastery. Because of her arrival, he wants to impress her with this wrestling so he can get her, the money, clothes, etc. even though its a ""sin."" He involuntarily meets his wrestling partner over a bag of chips (you'll know when you see the movie) and hilarity ensues.Except it wasn't really hilarious. You know that whole thing that Jack Black did in School of Rock with his hands and stuff (yeah, real specific I know, its hard to describe unless you see it...you know the diddly doo thing?)? Anyway, he does that here and I was taken out of the film...like, who the hell is this Ignacio? Is it Jack Black as Ignacio or someone else? So that was annoying.Additionally, there were some scenes that were really trying hard to be funny (physical humor and whatnot). I felt that and because I felt that, it was not randomly funny.Sure the whole banter between Esqueleto (Skeleton in English) and Jack Black were funny however, some felt forced. I guess this movie wasn't meant for me.All in all, another showcase for Jack Black to be Jack Black...but with an accent. (Don't get me started on those terrible Mexican accents!) Go see it if you love everything he's in...I thought I did too, but this was NOT IT.",Nacho Libre
328,nickbalgaard,"Clean, Quirky Comedy",8,27 July 2011,"Nacho Libre is one of those movies that is funnier every time you watch it. In general, comedies these days are hilarious the first time...but downright lame the second time. This is not so for Nacho Libre. Mostly, I believe this is true because Nacho does not involve a whole lot of surprise humor. It rarely throws a joke or a circumstance at you when you are not expecting it. Instead, it focuses on facial expressions, goofy one-liners, and slapstick blunders.In my opinion, the wrestling action is not very intense, and is usually quite comical in nature. Beware, however! Some of the moves could be dangerous if attempted by inexperienced children!Finally, most people don't give this film a chance because its pace is too slow and it does not include modern humor. But I'm here to tell you that if you can simply sit back, relax, and take Nacho for what it is, you will not be disappointed.",Nacho Libre
329,xorquin,Good Clean Fun - JB style,8,18 June 2006,"I read the 2 reviews before going to see this. Some points claimed it racist. I am from the midwest and the theater was packed with those of Mexican heritage. Young ones thru adult. I am of white anglo background and I've never been to Mexico. I found it more educational regarding Mexican culture as opposed to demeaning. But back to the film. This is probably one of Jack Blacks best works to date. The mustache lets Jack hide behind the persona and really move around in it. I never once felt JB was going for a cheap laugh on culture, but using the customs of that culture to enhance the film. It reminds me of the spaghetti westerns. Even thought they were in Italy, didn't mean they were racists towards Italy. When I saw the Nick Productions at the beginning, I thought, well, this might be tame and lame. It was nicely edited with rarely a dull moment. Always hopping to the next sequence with out wasting time. I personally thought JB slipped more into a European accent from time to time while trying to fudge his Mexican accent. I'd highly recommend going to see this movie. I enjoyed every second and when I got home, I wanted to see it again for the things I missed. We looked up all the actors on IMDb and found they were all Mexicans in their first film. Pretty neat.",Nacho Libre

This movie makes fun of all the cliché's of the sport genre, and the love story and the religion VS sinful urge theme.

331,omit0,Funny in parts; not bad overall,6,7 March 2006,"I saw this movie last night at a screening on the Paramount lot. There are some laughs throughout, but the writing isn't particularly great. Much of what we're expected to find funny is the nuance in Jack Black's performance, which has its appeal. He is a great performer and very graceful in the wrestling ring.The movie will probably do okay at the box office, just due to Black's appeal and the cult status of Napoleon Dynamite and Mike White. If it was as low a budget as everyone on the bulletin board here claims, the movie will make money and everyone will be happy. I don't think that it will be a huge hit, though, even on the order of Napoleon Dynamite.Also, I'm curious to know what fans of Lucha Libre will think of this movie. It doesn't explain anything about the sport and some may even find it insulting, in that it often goes for laughs at the expense of the luchadores.",Nacho Libre

So I saw the movie this weekend and I'm glad I did because I can't remember when I've laughed so much or so hard at a movie. If you liked the humor of ""Napoleon Dynamite"" and enjoy your slapstick mixed in with more subtle humor (which I do), you'll love this movie. Jack Black does a great job of balancing the slapstick humor with developing his character as the sweet underdog you can't help but cheer for. The movie is great for the whole family to see and has a good message. It's also refreshing to see a movie where people can be religious and still laugh at themselves.",Nacho Libre
333,vovita,a tribute to Bud Spencer movies,9,9 May 2007,"??? I am a bit perplexed at the negative comments ... This is a comedy, not one of those deep, psychological dramas. Also, for those who have a good background in comedy, you should remember the ""spaghetti western comedies"" with Bud Spencer and Terrence Hill. This film is a new version of these fabulous comedies. Even though there was slapstick ""violence"" in those films, I don't believe they ever provoked any harm in real life. Millions of people across Europe grew up watching Bud Spencer films. Why does everything have to be politically correct to appeal to a mass? And has there ever been a successful politically correct comedy (note - rhetorical question!!)

If you grind the movie down to it's bones, yes, it is basically following the routine movie formulas, but with a very different flavor.To like this film, there are 2 prerequisites: 1) You have to like Jack Black and his goofy humor (of course, if you don't like him, why are you watching this film in the first place?) 2) You have to like the peculiar ""Napolean Dynamite""-style humor.Enjoy.",Nacho Libre

I could see every joke as it came along and had to endure the dull delivery of each old joke as it slowly played out. The delivery of some of storytelling's oldest cliché's in this film was not original at all and made me feel like I was listening to a child tell me a story. In fact, most of the laughs came from children in the audience. I actually laughed one time when something reminded me of a funny TV show I watched once.I could not muster up a laugh for this film; it was like something a person would write in one day without thinking about being clever or original in any way.Did anyone else think this movie was full of old jokes that were not delivered well?",Nacho Libre
336,sci_fan,See what it taste like!,6,21 February 2007,"I've read some horrible reviews of this one, so maybe it's my warped sense of humor, or the fact that I value non-sensical crap that dares to call itself a movie, but really, I think a lot of folks just didn't 'get it' and that's OK... Apparently, Jared Hess has made another 'love it or hate it' film. True, 'Nacho' is no 'Napoleon Dynamite', but it IS a worthwhile comedy, full of ridiculous quotes (in Jack Black's hilariously botched Mexican dialect) that you'll find yourself repeating for weeks (that is, if they don't become permanent expressions in your everyday language). The comedy works for the most part because it doesn't take itself seriously and expects that the audience won't either. Yes, it's got plenty of dumb gags. Yes, the story is 'unreal'. Yes, Black's Mexican accent is 'wrong', but therein lies the real humor. Obviously, Black didn't have a language coach in preparation for this role- and we can thank the Heavenly Father for that- a good 70% of the real funny moments hinge on Black's (purposeful?) contortions of culture, language and expression. So, I have to wonder what people were expecting here... Woody Allen? A surprising treat is the cinematography, which far surpasses most movies in this genre, and brings a real earthiness to the film and when contrasted with the marked 'unrealness' of the characters and situations, provide the film with a unique suspension of disbelief. The soundtrack is a real plus too!",Nacho Libre
337,gyarra,Hilarious from start to finish,10,2 July 2006,"Nacho Libre is one of those rare movies that had me laughing out loud for the entire movie. Jack Black is out his outrageous best. Each scene in Nacho is ridiculous and awkward in its own way, with keen originality and artistry. Even without the other characters and plot, Black could practically carry the movie on his own, simply with his unbelievable knack for expressions. Luckily there are a slew of hilarious, outlandish, freakish characters populating this movie who are intriguing in the way they so often defy the stereotypes one would usually attribute to them. My favorites were the midget Lion men.I have no idea why it is rated so low. Maybe a lot of old or humorless people felt compelled to denigrate this Summer's best comedy because they don't understand it or are angry at being so old and left behind.If you enjoyed Napolean Dynamite, you will certainly enjoy Nacho Libre.If you hate orphans and/or have an IQ below 50 and/or are really old and humorless, you might not enjoy this movie, so keep away.",Nacho Libre

They remain funny as they are unexpected and almost entirely new jokes, rather than tired puns pulled from old Looney Toon cartoons.Despite the constant laughs, the movie manages to keep the characters serious in their actions. Nothing is done out of place just to get a joke squeezed in. The love Nacho holds for the orphans he takes care of give him a very approachable nature and really make you feel for his plight with being a monk and his desire to be a luchadore.If you come with the intention of having fun, then you will enjoy this movie. Sourpusses should stay home as the comedy might be viewed as childish. Its a great one for the whole family and keeps the reputation of a Nickelodean Film intact.

The theater was almost full and out of the many children there, there was maybe only 3 of them laughing during the entire film. Everyone else was just bored.The movie tries to make you laugh by throwing all of the same old punches we've been seeing in comedies for years, (People so poor they eat dirt and what not). And when those routines fail, they throw cheap fart jokes out just to try and pull some small bit of laughter from the kids. Its quite sad that a movie written by such an acclaimed man falls so short that even his target audience, kids, don't even find it funny.However, thats not to say that the whole movie is just a dull affair. I found one joke to be rather funny which concerned how a fat woman sneaks around her house as she chased after Jack Black's small partner. Too bad that was only 5 seconds out of the hour and forty minutes we spent in the theater.Jack Black does a good job at playing his character, in fact, all the actors do a fine job. It's just that the writing falls short of providing any sort of humor. Even in movies like Toy Story or Robots there was at least some well thought out jokes that could still get a chuckle out of many people.If you have kids who watch Nick, they may like this movie because of the silly fighting Jack takes part in, otherwise, there's little to laugh at in this movie, and what there is just isn't that funny.",Nacho Libre

However, the same director has managed to surpass Napoleon. Although some may say that the humor was potty-ish, I would probably describe it as crazy, hilarious, and unpredictable. I guess the type of comedy is comparable to that of Harold and Kumar, although this has no drug/alcohol jokes, it maintains the same randomness. The movie turns out to not only be funny, but Nacho ends up being somewhat of an inspirational character. Overall, this is an excellent movie, which is family friendly, and something any person with a sense of humor should be able to enjoy.

Jack Black's performance is different than any of his other performances, but has his characteristics attached. The chemistry between him and the lovely Ana de la Reguera is perfect.

Very creative and very funny. I also took to it because of its religious values. Ignacio(Jack Black) plays a friar who takes care of the orphans at the monastery but longs to became a luchador named Nacho. The thing I liked about this movie is that Nacho did not want to fight for vanity but to get money to help the orphans and become ""a wrestling servant for the Lord"". With the help of his sidekick Esqulito, a street peasant who only believes in science, he goes on to become a great fighter. I also liked the fact that Nacho was trying to help Esqulito believe in God. Jared Hess did a great job of showing that even though you may be a friar you can still be a luchador.

The humor in this film is a bit more from the toilet, there are lots of funny accents and there's wrestling.

This film might be the closest big screen foray into showcasing the comedic strengths that Black has displayed in really funny SNL sketches and his Tenacious D persona, and maybe that's what made it so fun for him.The best part of the film though is Esqueleto(Héctor Jiménez), a homeless man turned wrestler and only friend of Nacho.

Granted, it did have its funny moments, but otherwise was painful to watch as the plot and humour felt very forced.You are meant to feel sympathetic for Jack's character, a Mexican friar, especially given how close he is to the orphans who live there, but that felt especially forced.The only good thing out of it was Héctor Jiménez's character Esqueleto, who was funny and almost endearing, and you couldn't help caring more about the sidekick than the hero in this story. If you like potty jokes, crude humour, and silly wrestling stunts, this is for you, but I would advise you to skip it.",Nacho Libre

359,RoboMaster,Napoleon Dynamite meets Mexican Wrestlers,9,30 June 2006,"If you are a fan of Napoleon Dynamite and/or Jared Hess, you'll love this movie! It has some crude things they do, but apart from that (and the fact that they're wrestlers that are mildly violent) it is a great summer hit that you'll want to see again & again! This movie stars Jack Black, who makes a perfect ""mexican""; He adds prefect ""Jack Blacky-ness"" to the movie. Nacho Libre starts out a little slow (mainly introducing characters & main plots), although since most movies start out this way; it's okay. In my opinion, this is a great movie for preteens & up! Very Clean, Very Funny, Nicely made, & great story; WHAT MORE COULD YOU ASK FOR! I give it a 4 out of 5 stars.-Robo",Nacho Libre
360,kelbo66,Jared & Jack not giving back.,1,24 July 2006,"I recently saw Nacho Libre and was pleasantly entertained. I had the pleasure to meet the elderly Mexican priest whose story the movie is based upon. His name is Padre Fray Tormenta (Brother Storm). Now retired from the ring, he still says the mass in his Luche mask. He used the winnings from his wrestling matches to build a home for at-risk boys. To date he has helped over 2000 young boys. I learned that when approached by the producers about his story he chose to negotiate the rights himself. Needless to say, in a Luche match between Los Hollywood Diablos and Fray Tormenta- the outcome is an obvious one. On top of this, no one from the production- especially the director and the star made any donation to the orphanage or the church. This is a church covered in peeling paint, the orphanage has a broken down van, a cook who left cuz there was no money- its a dilapidated structure that is barely surviving.Shame on the filmmakers and the cast. The per diem for the week of one of them could let the orphanage survive for a year. The star sneezes money that could help 2000 more kids. The Padre was never even invited to the set. No benefit screening, no fund raiser, no sponsored ebay auction, no benefit Tenacious D concert, no quiet donation, nothing, nada.Upon hearing all of this from the priest, I emptied my wallet of everything I had in it- an embarrassing $60. I gave more to him than Jack Black did (!) yet I didn't make the millions of dollars that the filmmakers and stars did off of the Padre's life story. I'm assuming Salt Lake City got its 10%.",Nacho Libre
361,adszc,Hilarious,7,19 June 2006,"I have to say that Jack Black is a nut, a hilarious one, but still a nut. His facial expressions are priceless, and when it comes to comedy it can either make or break a scene. I can't however forget to mention how funny his sidekick is. He was undoubtedly a perfect match for Black, almost paying homage to the more present Ren and Stimpy. But not only did Black and his sidekick have chemistry, as awkward as it seemed so did Black and the beautiful new comer Ana de la Reguera. I give her credit on hearing from a recent interview that during the whole film she tried to remain as professional as possible, and I know for a fact that I would of cost the studios a pretty penny from my unstoppable laughter. The point is if you have a sense of humor you'll like Nacho Libre, if not get one!",Nacho Libre
362,rabidcoathangerEATME,Nacho Libre...a movie that dreamers seem to understand.,7,27 June 2006,"My first thoughts of this movie were: ""Either this is going to suck or get popular in a year like Napoleon Dynamite"". My impression from the commercials was: ""God...this is Nickelodeon crap, nobody's gonna care"". I was mistaken.Nacho Libre is about a Catholic monk named Ignacious (Jack Black) living in rural Mexico who works/lives at a center that cares for orphans. Ignacious has always dreamed of becoming a wrestler, Nacho. He soon learns that he cannot hid his secret life from Sister and the orphans, so he makes a decision.Anyway, I'd found Nacho Libre to be an interesting movie. The plot was interesting enough, a monk gone wrestler. Ignacious and his friend (a misfit Ignacious had met in an alley while buying chips) perform funny gestures to get into the wrestling business and find themselves sitting ducks. Let's get to the point: Pros: *Interesting plot *Lush colors *Fast-paced *Hidden humor *Monty Python-esquire humorCons: *Acting bordered on poor *Jack Black cannot imitate a Spanish accent to save his life *4 Camera angles were used the whole time. *A bit too religious.Overall, Nacho Libre is just a good time movie.",Nacho Libre
363,oliver-baldner,just a reminder....,8,10 July 2006,"this is black and white production. How many of you needed to see Napoleon Dynamite two, three, four, maybe five times in order to fully understand the absurd humor they were going for? I can see how many of you may not have understood, and may not ever understand, the complete absurdity the surround Hess's films. However, i do give Hess and Company props with capturing Mexico in all the absurdity that surrounds it. As for Black? are you really expecting anything different? He is a character actor who has found a shtick and will continue to be one until the audiences stops laughing. The only difference here is that he was capable of finally doing the same stuff.....in tights.to rap this all up. I wasn't impresses either the first time i saw it. I finally peed my pants the third time. and by the way......the soundtrack kicks ass.",Nacho Libre

I loved Nacho Libre (Jack Black)'s witty humor.********************SPOILER************************I loved seeing the chemistry in this movie. The relationship between Black and Sister Encarnación (Ana de la Reguera) was interesting to watch as the Catholic religion forbids such a relationship between a friar and a nun. Very hilarious!I also loved seeing Black and Ramses (Cesar Gonzalez) go at it in the big wrestling match. Very well orchestrated jump by Black to go after a fleeing Gonzalez.

Anyway, I'm Hispanic and I really don't think it was racist I didn't feel insulted by the movie but maybe is because I'm not Mexican.About the characters they were extremely predictable, dull, underdeveloped and stereotypical. It probably was funny and I probably would have laughed but I fell asleep twice. The movie is basically for little kids, since they were the only ones laughing in the theatre. There were no funny lines, the scenes were very predictable, and the story was slow. Nacho Libre could easily be another pointless nickelodeon show. It was so damn predictable I can guess the parts I missed and I would be right. The character's actions were just dumb and pointless.The only reason I didn't walk out was because I didn't pay for it and I felt bad for the guy who paid for my ticket.",Nacho Libre

Jack Black is absolutely amazing in every way shape and form. The subtle humor ties his great acting together, he is great at telling jokes that are pg but still very very effective. My favorite part about the movie is the comradery he builds with Chancho. The priest and boy have such great rapport. Nacho Libre exceeds my expectations every time I watch it. I have seen the movie 10 times. If you are looking for good family fun and a lighthearted laugh then Nacho Libre is right up your alley.",Nacho Libre

The previews were so hilarious, and Jack Black can make any role humorous. The movie, though, was somewhat disappointing. Classic Nickelodeon humor peeks out often, with random farts and bathroom noises added to the plot. Not to mention fat ladies crawling on the ground like enormous guinea pigs. The lack of fresh ideas for comedy is apparent, with the funniest moments in the plot having already been shown in the previews. All in all, this was a movie mostly intended for little kids who think fat guys in underwear and farts are funny. Still, though, the stupidity of it all was almost the humor itself, and I found myself laughing at the fart jokes thinking, ""How stupid... haha look at him... hahaha"". If you're looking for a laugh at Jack Black's expense, you'd like this movie.",Nacho Libre

Not only is it the funniest film I've seen sense I don't know when, it is unpredictable and makes you never want it to end. It has many moments that you and your friends can talk about over and over again after the movie is over. I loved School of Rock but I think this is Jack Black's greatest film ever. It was so good I'm going to pay to see it again this week with other people and buy it the day it comes out on DVD.

Those of you thinking, ""Oh no! Another one from that 'Napoleon Dynamite' director? I hated that movie!"" don't worry. This one actually has a plot. It has lots of funny parts, and the entire theater clapped when it was done. Everyone was getting into the movie, and the middle-aged woman beside me was laughing uncontrollably at one point. The people in the theater that seemed to be enjoying themselves the most were college students. I am a high school student, and I also found it to be quite funny. I have a feeling that younger kids would also enjoy this, but there weren't any in the theater, so I can't tell you. If I had to compare it to any other movie in terms of comedy, it would probably be ""Mr. Deeds."" Both have lots of physical humor, as well as verbal. I recommend it to you. You will laugh at some point, I can almost guarantee. I wouldn't take a girl out to see it for a first date, but it would probably be fine if you knew the person had a sense of humor. It was well worth my time, and I plan on seeing it again once it officially comes out.",Nacho Libre

372,MathDood,T'was Indeed A Great Movie!,10,16 June 2006,"I would have to give Nacho Libre a 10/10. I have been anticipating this movie ever since I heard about it during the spring semester. It met all of my expectations. I was laughing through it the whole time. The plot and the characters are put together very lightly; the humor is very random, off-the-wall, dry, and nonsensically goofy. In those ways, it preserves the flavor of Napoleon Dynamite, which was a WONDERFUL movie. Some people like that kind of humor, and some people don't. My sense of humor also has that tone...so I am a big fan of Jared and Jerusha Hess (the writers/director of Nacho Libre and Napoleon Dynamite). So, that's my bias. Therefore, if you liked Napoleon Dynamite, this movie is for you. If not, there still is a chance that you may like it. Not only does it have the Napoleon Dynamite-style, but much of Jack Black's unique comical flavor shines through too. Fans of Jack Black should like this as well. Speaking of the material in the movie, I would say that it is quite appropriate for the whole family. I'm not saying that this movie is a movie well-suited for kids, though I'm sure they'll find many things in the movie to laugh about. I would say that the humor and substance more suits those among the ages ranging from late-high-school-age through adults of all ages. When I first saw Napoleon Dynamite, I was floored in amazement. I thought it was a revolutionary masterpiece. These movies are so funny. What makes them revolutionary is that it is a genuine comedy. That takes talent and a true sense of humor. Any idiot can come up with gross sexual innuendos and use crude language. That's what ""comedies"" today are all about; there's nothing special about that; it's awful and it makes me cringe. NachoLibre/NapoleonDynamite are completely devoid of anything immoral and are completely clean. For Jared and Jerusha Hess, because of that, I have MUCH respect. Now for those who thought that this movie was racist: There is absolutely nothing that could ever be viewed as offensive toward those of Latino and Mexican decent. Perhaps not everything in this movie encompasses what Mexico is really like; that's not the point of the movie. It seems that such people like to find things to complain about and make it as serious an issue as racism. If you thought this movie was racist, it's time to grow up.",Nacho Libre

This seems to be repeated in Nacho Libre where the main focus was on Jack Black and his sheer comic genius WHILE maintaining his role, when i saw it in theatres at least one third of place didn't stop laughing the entire time solely because of facial expressions and little antics. I find that this was a great movie and surpassed Napolean Dynamite since the main character wasn't unknown and was already relatively liked as a comedic actor in the community. All in all this was a great movie and was a well needed comedy.",Nacho Libre

The film is bad enough that I must struggle to identify other films that belong in the same cesspool to which this cinematic excrement should be consigned.In leaving Nacho Libre today, I was struck at how awful the film is in nearly every category by which films are ordinarily judged. Comedies should be funny, but this film failed to generate even a single muted giggle from the regrettably large audience at the local theater.The cinematography, screenplay and dialogue are truly without parallel. A single mediocre performance provided by even one member of the cast would have vastly improved this film. The wrestling sequences, which might have been entertaining in the hands of a competent director, elicited disgust rather than laughter from the audience.I left the the theater thinking that Jack Black and Jared Hess apparently decided to make this film as an afterthought. The final scene is a shot of Nacho and the children from the orphanage visiting pyramids in Mexico. Why couldn't Jack Black have just taken some vacation time at his own expense and spared us the tasteless Nacho Libre?""",Nacho Libre

Thankfully Jared Hess' film-making has matured, so we're not being subjected to another low-budget college film project with bad lighting, underdeveloped characters, and a tenuous storyline (and yes, I loved Napoleon Dynamite as well). Jack Black's cheesy accent and dialog go hand in hand with the cheesy reality of professional wrestling (from any nation). It's exactly the kind of movie Cantinflas would want to make (if he were alive today and directing movies). Slapstick prevails. Everybody wins. Even polyester comes out looking good.",Nacho Libre

But whereas I was mildly amused by Napoleon and enjoyed some of the gags, this movie had very little going for it. I went because I like to give every movie the benefit of the doubt, but the only thing this movie did have was the gorgeous woman playing the nun.Jack Black simply wasn't funny in this movie, the fact that they had to throw in fart jokes just to keep people laughing is a perfect example. I've read a couple of comments that said the entire theatre was cracking up, but you honestly could have heard a pin drop after some of the punchlines where I saw it, and it was a full house. The last time I laughed so little at a comedy was Anchorman, and it had the same feel to it, you could hear everyone go silent for the joke in anticipation, and then a few nervous laughs as everyone realized that it wasn't funny.As far as being racist goes, I can't honestly say, since only someone Hispanic could answer to that. That having been said, there were certain jokes and remarks that I could definitely see being taken the wrong way.",Nacho Libre

As the old one-liner says, ""Ya pays your money and ya takes your chances."" Jack is a great comedic actor and his timing is up there with the best but with this bit of fluff he doesn't even come close to making me smile much less laugh. Being a resident of South Texas and an Angelo I found myself slipping lower and lower in my seat when Jack tried that sudo-Mexican accent. I'm not Catholic, but hitting on a nun can't be a good thing. Finally, the story wasn't funny. I kept finding myself reflecting back to other great comedies like Ishtar and Glitter. Jack will make other great films, this was not one of them. If someone invites you to attend this piece of feldacarb say audios and run for the border as fast as you can.",Nacho Libre

I've overheard a lot of people saying negative things about this movie, but I think it's because people are going into the theater hoping to see a Saving Silverman-esquire movie. This movie is produced by Nickelodeon Studios: it's a kids movie! The humor is simple (lots of physical comedy and fart jokes), the plot is simple, the dialog is simple (for older kids). I took my youngest sister to see it (age 6) and she thoroughly got a kick out of it.The plot slows down in a few places, but the momentum picks back up. In my opinion, this is not a speed bump for Jack Black's career. Go back and watch it again. Like Napoleon Dynamite, it's much funnier the second time around.",Nacho Libre

However, my friends who are not familiar with Mexican culture did not find it as funny as I did. You need to understand some of the Spanish in the movie to understand what's going on. Just the title itself for example, wrestling in Mexico is called ""lucha libre."" Which is not directly translated to ""free fight"" it's actually means wrestling. In ""lucha libre"" wrestlers wager their masks and long hair, the loser takes off the mask or cuts their hair at the end of a fight. So that explains the masks and hair. Many more little things like this that are not part of everyday American culture make the movie difficult to understand or simply not as funny to some people.I laughed through the whole movie! And the people with me did not, probably because they were not Mexican or were not familiar with the language and culture. There were times when I was the only person in the theater laughing!

It also afforded me several rather interesting witnessing opportunities because I saw it with my boyfriend, who is agnostic. Some have said that the film comes off as offensive with regards to religion because it could be interpreted as making fun of Catholics. I personally was not at all offended when watching it, though I can see why it might rub some people the wrong way as. I suppose that is something to consider before watching it. I'm just happy that Nickelodeon had the guts to make a movie about - gasp! - God in a day and age when talking about religion has become so taboo. They never mention the Lord Jesus, but His Father is readily talked about and prayed to. I'd say that's a pretty good start.",Nacho Libre

This is truly the worst movie I've ever paid to see. Careers need to be ruined because of this film, starting with Jack Black. My 15 year old son dragged me to the theater to witness this celluloid train wreck, (he has subsequently lost movie picking privileges forever). I did however go into the cineplex with an open mind, as I usually enjoy mindless entertainment, but not this mindless. Flush your 8 bucks down the toilet rather than wasting hard earned cash on this debacle. In case you did'nt figure it out by now, I really hated this movie. No animals were harmed in the writing of this comment.",Nacho Libre
393,this_movie_blows,Off The Charts BAD.,1,4 July 2006,I argued with a friend about whether to see this film. He won. We went. We didn't laugh. Nobody laughed. I have a feeling Jack Black and Mike White are laughing...You know things are getting bad culturally speaking when a movie studio can actually make money selling a movie like this.IT'S NOT FUNNY. Period.I thought I was having a dream as I watched this it was so awful. It was that surreal of an experience. The script is a joke. The accents are painful to listen to. There is NOTHING unpredictable about the plot. Jack Black phoned in his performance and I'm afraid is just NOT FUNNY ANYMORE.,Nacho Libre
394,g-23172-60880,Nacho libre: the movie Spielberg wishes he made,10,22 January 2020,"By Sam HamshariAre you looking for a film that includes the marvelous Jack Black working in a monastery speaking with an accent that vaguely resembles that of a Mexican man while moonlighting as a luchador to pay for orphaned children's meals? Well, boy, do I have the movie for you: Nacho Libre. This action-packed thriller of an underdog story is best highlighted by the use of thematic music, perfectly appropriate acting, and a setting that makes the audience feel like they're really there in the ring with Nacho himself.
Nacho Libre depicts a middle-aged monk (played by Jack Black) cooking for the children of a monastery and being constantly put down by the other monks. He comes to the realization that in order to win the affection of a newfound love interest named Encarnacion (played by Ana de la Reguera) and save the children of the orphanage from a life of dirty meals and dull religion, he must become a luchadore and fight for what he believes in.
Jack Black hits the part of ""Nacho"" out of the park with his slightly off-brand Mexican accent in combination with his horrible facial hair, and perfectly fitting gastrointestinal difficulties. There seems to be a sense of humor to Nacho's character that the audience can relate to. He is truly a proper vessel to deliver the sense of humor of the movie has to offer. While most jokes hit right on the money, I will admit that punchlines can sometimes be a bit predictable or even a bit dull.
This flaw is dramatically overcome, however, with director Jared Hess' almost Tarantino-like style of scene composition. At one point in the movie, rather than focus on each individual fight of Nacho's career, Hess composes a montage of many different times Nacho gets (and I'm being polite here) the crap kicked out of him. The scenes in the montage consist of very little dialogue, and perfectly fitting mariachi music. This advances the story without taking up too much of the audience's time. He doesn't only organize the scenes effectively and in a concise manner. Hess also uses color and textures in the background to give the audience the feeling that they really are in an impoverished Mexican city filled with people trying to make a name for themselves. He uses tracking shots and close-ups to convey a sense of intimacy with the characters and scenery. The real marvel in this film, which won the movie it's ""BMI Film Music Award"", is the film score. The authentic Mexican tunes playing in key moments helps set the mood or even excite the audience in critical scenes.
In the end, the film's lighthearted approach to a Latin American underdog story delivers a beautiful message to the audience: believe in your dreams. A character who the audience can relate to as being awkward and having high aspirations shows us that dreams can come true. This masterpiece acknowledges its own humorous nature and still manages to turn itself into a heartwarming story of a monk who just wants to do good for his community.
I strongly recommend Nacho Libre to anybody in need of a pick-me-up. In fact, regardless of your mood I would recommend that you experience Nacho Libre at least once in your life. You might be surprised by its beautiful composition, fitting score, and perfect mediocre acting. All of these elements combine flawlessly to deliver an action-packed story that is sure to impress any avid moviegoer.",Nacho Libre
395,bmonty55,Great Movie,10,5 July 2006,"I saw the movie, and the first thing that came to my mind was ""Originality"". I think this kind of comedy is so original, it does not make it seem like ""all the other"" movies. I appreciate originality, and I think Jack Black did an excellent job as a Mexican wrestler. I live in a border city with Mexico, and Jack Black is NOT TOO WHITE!!! to play a Mexican. Whoever wrote that comment, sounds a little bias, and is not aware at all as to what Mexican look like. The accents were great, and that is what made it even funnier, (living in a Mexican community). I think even the ""Mexican"" audience appreciated it, because when i have gone to see it, everyone laughs in unison!!! I appreciate this kind of movie, the music was great, and it just shined!! I am looking forward in seeing more of this kind of comedy.",Nacho Libre
396,micru45,Refreshing Family Comedy,8,12 July 2006,"This is truly a family comedy that is refreshing as much is it is off the wall. Having lived a number of years in Mexico I could really relate to the humour. I loved the cute story line as much as the gags. Jack Blacks facial expressions, punchlines and ""luchador"" moves had me laughing so hard I cried! I don't pay much attention to FX or continuity as long as the story keeps me captivated and there was never a dull moment in this movie.Those who are not familiar with Mexico, luchadores or the like might not quite get all the subtleties of the humor. I thought it was a pretty darn good, clean fun, mocking of Mexican humour and culture. Hmmm, I just wonder how a white guy from Idaho (Jared Hess) managed to do such a good job in portraying it!",Nacho Libre
397,ronasmiles2,LOVED the movie,8,16 July 2006,"My husband dragged me to this movie on a HOT evening, (mainly to sit in an air-conditioned theatre, I'm sure.) I previously haven't been a huge fan of Jack Black, but that changed after enjoying this surprisingly upbeat movie! Nacho Libre had me laughing & ROLLING almost out of my seat. I feel like I need to see it again, because during one of the wrestling scenes, (where you are seeing-double)I was laughing so hard that I couldn't keep up with what was happening and yet, couldn't control myself enough to stop laughing at it. I have to say that I expected a little more 'crudeness' than it actually contained, and felt uplifted and refreshed when we walked out at the end. My face still hurts from laughing . . .",Nacho Libre

So, he comes up with the far-fetched idea of becoming a Mexican wrestler.",8,19 July 2006,"I haven't laughed this hard for almost an entire 1 1/2 hours in years! And the laughter from the rest of the audience was almost deafening--my ears were ringing throughout the movie. I have to note that the audience was comprised of all ages--from young kids to couples in their sixties! The film itself has an Indie feel which adds to the quirkiness of the movie. Jack Black is perfect as Nacho, and I'd say it's one of his best performances, showing his gift for physical comedy and the ability to deliver comic lines perfectly. My husband and I were remembering lines days later and laughing all over again. We originally wanted to see a different movie, but it was sold out. We left the theater glad that we saw this one instead.",Nacho Libre
399,paulberman613,Jack Black's Worst,3,6 September 2006,"I am a big Jack Black die hard fan. But, every fan has limitations on what is good. Orange County and High Fidelity are two of his best works. Nacho Libre, unfortunately, comes up on the other end of the spectrum. It certainly makes my Bottom Ten List of 2006. Outside of some of the wrestling scenes this movie was mostly unfunny, boring, with bad sound, as well as, uneven editing and not to forget Jack's inconsistent and poorly understandable Spanish accent. Peter Stormare makes a cameo appearance, but he was not enough to have helped. It just seems that this film was attempted to satisfy a few, if any. If you see this movie you will be disappointed.",Nacho Libre
400,SupperLicker,"An extraordinarily outstanding comedy, oh unless your daft.",10,20 September 2006,"Everyone who doesn't like this movie is someone I don't want to know... you boring old bastards. Now I must say I am in no way loyal to any of the people who made this film. I am not a huge Jack Black fan or even particularly fans of the film makers. So know when I say, ""THIS MOVIE IS PURE UNADULTERATED GENIUS"", that I do not say that to put a dollar in my pocket. To understand a film like this, you need tap into the part of your mind that is still young and better yet warped. You need to remind yourself of the experiments you conducted to gain power in your childhood. The foes you stood against and the means by which you intended to defeat them. If you can do that, then you will laugh from the beginning to end of this film. After this film, I have to give me deepest respect to Jack Black. He deserves it. What a man.",Nacho Libre
401,Davrot,I hated Napoleon Dynamite,6,14 August 2006,"To be honest, I was at a loose end on Saturday. I had previously liked Jack Black in school of rock and hated Napoleon Dynamite. Therefore, I didn't know what to expect of this film.Apart from some really annoying aspects of some scenes (exaggerated eating noises), I enjoyed the experience of watching the story unfold in a pretty fantastic setting. However, the story does unfold pretty slowly and it is utterly predictable.The Nun is beautiful (keeps your interest) and occasionally Jack Black does try to introduce a little of what he does best.Unfortunately, the end result is Jack looking a little awkward in some places and this does detract from the overall experience.Ultimately, you'll walk away with a warm feeling as the ending in nice, although you'll wonder why you're feeling like that because for the majority of the film you're waiting for the next funny thing to happen.David",Nacho Libre
402,kcasanovo,Hilarious and Heart-wrenching,10,15 August 2006,"Without seeing any previews or hearing much talk about it, I went to the theater without any expectations of this movie.When I walked out of the theater, I felt like a different person.The plot is another golden nugget of genius for Jared Hess. Just like Napoleon Dynamite, it is a wholesome story that parents can take their children to. Not a single curse word and all generations can understand its humor.I didn't find this movie at all predictable and in fact I marveled at its uniqueness. Inserting gut-busting Jack Black humor which was equal only to his compassion for the orphans he feeds, I laughed throughout and cried at one point and I left feeling optimistic about the state of humanity.On setting the story in Mexico, it's about time somebody inserted Mexican life into American pop culture. It was a bold move considering the current tensions between the two countries. Mexico isn't all about wrestling and monasteries, but the movie proves that the tension isn't everywhere, and hopefully this unifying spirit will manifest into further facets of American life in the coming years.",Nacho Libre
403,DublinWill,Absolutely Awful!!!,1,16 August 2006,"I hate to say this given that Napoleon Dynamite was the best film I saw in the last few years but the new offering from the creators of the aforementioned would probably go on my list.....way down at the other end of the scale!!! Napoleon was fresh, smart and very very funny and Nacho Libre was laboured, forced and so not funny as to be beyond belief!!! I have nothing against Jack Black but he was very very poor in this film. He was trying to hard and to be honest the only laugh I got in watching this was his Little ode to his never-to-be girlfriend!!! This was typical Jack ""Black"" Humour and wasn't even original.I could go on and on moaning but I'd rather not waste anymore of my time on this film!!! My advice..... Don't bother!",Nacho Libre
404,blechblech,I enjoyed it!,8,18 August 2006,"I enjoyed it. The humor is a little dry. This is a parody on the down and out who becomes successful without telling his friends, gets found out in the end. If you can't get the parody/spoof of a movie genre you probably won't like it. I found it extremely funny. You may wonder why Jack Black would produce a film. I suspect it is because this is an under spoken form of humor you don't see very often on the big screen. Similar to Steven Wright in that you need to really absorb the themes to enjoy. Not everyone goes to the movies for an experience that requires the viewer to pay attention and think about what is going on in a comedy.",Nacho Libre

Jack black cant do a great accent all the time but its all-round great and he really makes this film stand out as being hilarious. Typical boy meets girl. Boy tries to impress girl. Finds out she doesn't like this and that .so on and so forth. There is hidden depth to this film. I will buy it when it comes to DVD. I would advise seeing the film with a Spanish speaker. they will clarify some of the unknown jokes you may hear some people laughing at without something funny happening.,Nacho Libre

Not all people are going to laugh as much as I did during this movie, but it is perfect for those with my sense of humour.Jack Black plays a 'man of the cloth', who is tired of the lowly duties assigned to him and wishes to be a wrestler. It may not be the most imaginative idea ever, but, really, it's a couple of hours away from reality, and i throughly enjoyed it.Liking this film has nothing to do with intelligence either, as some people have said, it's all about your sense of humour. If you like films such as, Napoleon Dynamite, School of Rock, even Monty Python, with silly, probably quite predictable jokes, you'll like this.All in all, I loved this movie. There were some lines in it which were just hilarious. One of my friends i went with, said the movie 'Looked Lame' but it turned out, she loved it as well.So, If you want a couple of hours from reality to enjoy a bit of silliness and have a laugh, I'd give this movie a chance. You may be surprised.",Nacho Libre

Otherwise, it's kinda boring. You have to appreciate the subtleties! Jack Black uses a lot of physical nuances as punchlines, so you must pay attention or you'll miss the jokes. I don't know much about Mexican wrestling, so I am not aware of how this movie will be accepted by fans of the sport. But it is funny. Do not look to the script or story for any judgment regarding this movie's merit, because the charm lies solely in the acting. Many of the greatest moments were created by a combination of manner and timing, as well as editing of course. This movie is obviously a product of Nickelodeon Studios, and the humor will be appreciated by fans of Jimmy Neutron, Spongebob, and other Nicktoons.",Nacho Libre

It was not funny, not entertaining, and a total bore. I couldn't wait for it to be over and can not believe i wasted 9 bucks on it. Jack Black, who I usually enjoy, was lame, as well as the rest of the cast. The movie seemed as if it were trying to equal the stupid humor of Napoleon Dynamite, but in the process created a terrible film. There is no way that anyone in their right mind could have enjoyed this movie. Do no rent it, buy it on DVD, or see it in theaters, because you will be disgusted in the terribleness of this movie.

I love an original script were you don't know what to expect next. The Hess brothers have a knack for finding unusual characters and I love it. I hope they produce many more movies like this one. I loved the simpleness of the movie and the characters.

Once I found where this movie was coming from, it had me LOL and getting a few glances from others more interested in the food. Let me explain. Its not gag, punchline funny and was never intended to be. The understated dryness of visual gags and 'dead pan' delivery of dialog makes this movie totally ridiculous and a crack up! Black is great and pulls off some excellent poses. The movie is clever and artistically shot, adding even more depth to the humour. At worst this movie has a few slow spots, but it is peppered with some great 'laugh till there is dribble running out the side of your mouth' slapstick.",Nacho Libre

When I saw this movie I did not know that the Hess brothers was behind this film, but I remember saying loud to my self that it felt like when I saw ""Napoleon Dynamite"". Don't watch the movie just because of Jack Black (it may not be his best performance, but the script, scenography, music and other characters are more than well compensating for that), or you will be disappointed. That's my opinion anyway, hope that helps you decide.",Nacho Libre

I was impressed with Jack Black's performance. Jared Hess is a genius! I have to say I enjoyed it more than Napoleon Dynamite. It brilliantly written. I had a total laugh riot at the theatre when I saw it, and all my friends couldn't stop talking about it. I liked the soundtrack as well. It was very refreshing to see a genuine comedy like this one. The DVD has hours of extra footage and hilarious outtakes! You have to buy it...this movie was really unexpected. I never expected it to be so great as it was.

I have to answer the brilliant comment about how we are all super-sensitive about racial issues. The movie is supposed to be a Mexican orphanage scenario ---- the accent is annoying that's as far as we agree. I don't like being categorized as an accented weirdo --- and movies typecast exactly that kind of behavior. Latinos are just entering the realm in Hollywood - finally opening doors for titles and supporting roles. Nacho Libre provides a leading role - sure given to a white male - but the cast is primarily Hispanic. It's all about opportunity and I for one am thankful that my Latino culture is finally getting its opportunity. Jack Black is hilarious in whatever he does - and his role as a Mexican monk is somewhat unusual but equally funny. I'm not personally offended, there is a retarded Napoleon now there's a weirdo Nacho.

The idea of such a shallow script is to bring fun and jokes along the way, but it just doesn t. I guess the writers forgot it was a comedy.

Kids would enjoy it, middle aged people would enjoy it and my grandma would have enjoyed it. You just need a tiny bit of a sense of humor. And to maybe have seen a bit of that type of wrestling before. The wrestling scenes were incredible. Jack's wrestling partner is lovable.

It was not racist either...anyone who thinks that is probably a very annoying person in general.This movie was totally silly fun with rhythm and tone that was spot on. The humor lacked the tired sexual jokes that seem to be obligatory in today's comedies, or idiotic humor of children-safe movies making it almost impossible to actually enjoy a laugh together as a family.There were so many jokes that were somehow incredibly funny as well as cute, like little Chancho, a kid at the orphanage who is especially fond of Nacho, giving Nacho his deceased mother's ""lucky Machete"" as a gift (one wonders how many machetes this woman had and why?!). Also, this movie had a good hearted story involving a man who is determined to use his desire to be a wrestler for good and not evil, showing us that you don't have to fit into a perfect mold to be a ""man of God"".Jack Black is a genius. His facial expressions and body language are enough to watch the movie with the sound off and still be rolling on the floor. Everything from the dead-pan delivery of Jack Black's lines (""It is in the bible not to wrestle your neighbor."")to the sleazy gypsy that tries to help them get magical ""eagle powers"" this movie is a new classic as far as I'm concerned.

So many lines in this movie have become part of my vocabulary! Please don't pay attention to the score. This movie is a feel-good winner. Jared Hess does a very good job following up on his performance with Napoleon Dynamite. If you enjoyed that movie there can be no question that you should enjoy this one.,Nacho Libre
427,JDCAce,"Below Average But Not Bad; Good, Non-Thinking Entertainment",6,21 July 2006,"Nacho Libre is, well, Nacho Libre.Very few movies these days don't require thinking, but Nacho Libre is one of them. The plot is short and simple and nearly anyone can understand it. Most of the humor is right there in front of you, not requiring sharp senses, making it easy for the kids, and since it is produced by Nickelodeon, as I discovered during the opening credits, I guess that's the aim.I found the characters underdeveloped and the acting subpar, especially from Nacho's skinny partner, Esqueleto, and the tubby orphan Juan Pablo. The script was fine, though very basic, and the music was redundant.This movie is definitely not for everyone, but if you like Jack Black, this movie is worth a try. Not his best acting, but he wasn't that bad. I personally believe the movie would have been better with another man cast as the lead.In short, don't spend $8.50 on this movie in the theater; wait to rent it.",Nacho Libre
428,mkaatman,The movie was hilarious,9,16 June 2006,"I was a little worried that it would be pure stupid humor, but I was quickly put in my place. The humor was brilliant. Jack Black filled this role perfectly. I couldn't stop laughing. The plot was well thought out and executed flawlessly. I highly recommend seeing it. I won't give away any spoilers. I will admit, I did miss the first 10 minutes of the movie. I'll have to rent it to find out how it started.Anyone that thought the movie was ""racist"" must be a racist themselves. (Quite honestly I'm sick of that attitude as well. Laugh people. It's funny for everybody.)Jack Black, if you're reading, well done!P.S. No eagles were harmed in the filming of this movie.",Nacho Libre
429,mokang1231,People are missing the subtle humor,8,10 June 2008,"As much as everyone says, this is not really a slapstick comedy. If it was, people would not be comparing it to Napolean Dynamite. In my opinion it is much better than Napoleon Dynamite with really great lines that I'm assuming many did not catch. Sure it was silly, but in an intelligent way. Check out Esqueleto's lines, played beautifully by Hecto Jiminez. The ending ""smile"" was hilarious. The entire premise was silly but the underacting really brought out the best. The only real beef I had was with Jack Black's overused ""musical"" talents. Otherwise the dialogue and( o yeah the music) was hilariously underdone. If you're not convinced, check out the quotes list here on IMDb, Or better yet see for yourself. Slapstick is okay. The lines are the true killer.However, as an Asian, the El Chino wrestler, I found to be a little too stereotypical. Perhaps it's just me but little things like that are what i find to be most significantly offensive.",Nacho Libre
430,cepaton,Not so much Tenacious as Tedious,1,7 July 2006,"I have followed Jack Black's performances since Cable Guy with great interest so i was really hoping to fall in love with his latest creation, Nacho, a monk who longs to be a luchador, however this was not to be. Nacho Libre is wrong on so many levels, firstly Jack Black waltzes through this film with a rehashed school of rock performance, full of zany stomping, crazy faces and an awful Mexican accent which slips during his Tenacious D episodes, which are peppered throughout the film. Secondly the script seems like an afterthought with real gags few and far between. (I laughed more watching Titanic than i did in this 'comedy'!) With every minute that passed in this film i grew more ill at ease but don't take my word for it... go see this horror for yourself! be afraid... be very afraid!",Nacho Libre
431,1234-1,This film was awful.. so so awful.,1,5 July 2006,"I decided to go see this film because I did not want to see the Adam Sandler movie which was showing (previous bad movies).I had no idea what the film was... except I was told it ""looked funny"" and was a ""comedy"".If Comedy has been re-defined then no-one told me... this film is far from funny.. I have seen more entertaining things happen on Big Brother or while eating breakfast. This film started off badly, continued badly and ended even worse.The acting was poor, the jokes were the mental age of a 3 year old and the story line was not interesting at all.They could have cut down all the time spent on the lame fighting scenes and made this into a kids TV show.Grr.. I want my money.. and wasted time back! Go see or rent something else!",Nacho Libre
432,eastern_film_fan,"Really, deserves better score and more viewers",7,19 June 2009,"From the trailers, I thought this would be a cheap, predictable, sophomoric comedy like ""Shallow Hal,"" or even worse-- completely cruel in the targets of its humor. Instead I really identified with the struggle and dreams of the main character, who is trying to rise above his low status as a cook at a monastery/orphanage. I like that his progress to the goal is slow and humorously humiliating.I also like how the movie didn't fall into some clichés-- no surge in wrestling prowess after eating the eagle egg, no nudity involving the nun, no running away with the nun at the end. Yes, there are still some clichés and stupidities, but they aren't at the heart of the movie. From the other comments, I gleaned that you won't enjoy this film if you are a serious wrestling fan or a very strict, inhibited Catholic.Some things that are especially funny-- Jack Black putting it out there bare chested and in tights, brief wild wrestling scenes that (thankfully) fake the violence badly. And the countryside is beautiful. I want to go there!",Nacho Libre
433,mongohuey,Jack Black is a genius,10,2 November 2006,"The script is so-so but Jack Black takes it to another level. He has the facial expressions to make you really believe he is not acting....a real Gem. The rest of the cast is superb. I guess most of the cast are from Mexico and probably not well known outside their country but they are perfectl in this movie. This is the kind of movie you can watch over and over again and still be entertained. Jared Hess was a good choice to direct, his quirky video style is refreshing, the way he concentrates on abstract objects like the bell on Nacho's handlebars is amusing. I highly recommend this movie to all Jack Black fans, and if your not a fan you will be after this one.",Nacho Libre
434,Seifer121086,"Feels like a Napoleon clone, and that's not a very good thing.",5,23 June 2006,"2 things to mention first. I like Jack Black. I think that he's a funny guy and I like what he does. Second, I liked Napoleon Dynamite. I thought it was entertaining with it's quirky characters and interesting directing. With those in mind, I was not satisfied with Nacho Libre.The plot is simple and easy to follow. Nacho likes wrestling. OK. Jack Black's character is pretty funny, but other than that, the movie is weak.I felt like Jared Hess was shooting Napoleon Dynamite, except he replaced Napoleon with Nacho and the Mexican sidekick with....another Mexican sidekick.Overall, it's kind of funny, but not gut-busting. I'm pretty sure that it won't get the huge cult following that Napoleon Dynamite did. If you like Jack Black, go see a cheaper matinée showing, or just wait until it's out on DVD.",Nacho Libre
435,cecyhglori,Tribute to EL SANTO and CAPULINA,8,21 October 2009,"I just had the opportunity to watch NACHO LIBRE for the second time and, even though I was predisposed (I didn't like it that much the first time; it is surprisingly ironic how most of the dialogs lost their meaning when translated to Spanish), I started smiling because I was getting the meaning from the very beginning. I loved the way the director captured the essence and the ""involuntary comedy"" of the Mexican movies of the 1960's-70's.As a youngster, my cousins and I used to get together every Saturday to have lunch at my Grandma's, and always after lunch we watched the main station here (Televisa), which featured movies by Capulina and El Santo. Capulina is an adorable, lovable, silly fat guy with mustache, and sometimes acted with his skinny not as lovable ""sideshow"" Viruta. El Santo was considered as ""national superhero"" and occasionally had as ""sideshow"" Blue Demon. Capulina did comedies for kids where he always ended up by change defeating the evil ones and saving the goodies. On the other side, El Santo was a super famous wrestler that also did acting, but his movies weren't comedies, they were more adventure/mystery and sometimes horror movies. Things in common in movies that are featured by these two characters: very poor production, direction, and acting. Why where they famous? Because that was the only thing that was available at the time. Why did I watch them when I was young? Because as kid I thought they were the funniest or scariest and coolest pictures ever (I think most Mexicans of mygeneration would agree).About a decade ago a trend started here in Mexico and even got into other countries. These icons I just mentioned where taken as cult. Their movies are entertaining to watch now, not because they are good movies, but because there's so much wrong going on. Capulina is supposedly fighting the evil guys at night and you can see a ball in the sky (sun), El Santo is driving his sports car but the speedometer is not marking a thing, El Santo was swimming with his suit (he wore a suit and a mask for going out) and when he gets out of the sea he is all dry, just to state only a few examples. And, above all, the plots where soooo lame and slow; most of the scenes were El Santo fighting on the ring or Capulina making his silly jokes.That being said, I think Jared Hess watched the movies that I just wrote about, studying very well this trend and capturing it on his movie. The attires all characters wear (clearly from the 1970's), the way the bad guys act -Ramsés and his guys picture exactly how a wrestler would look like and fight like in one of El Santo's movies-, the simple plot, and the silly and good hearted personality of Ignacio (even the mustache!) are some few things from NACHO LIBRE that remind me of Capulina and El Santo.NACHO LIBRE is kind of a tribute to them and there is nothing involuntary in it. Every little detail is well thought and cleverly transformed from the simple movies I wrote about to what NACHO LIBRE is. It not only has the influence of Napoleon Dynamite, but also reflects the pop culture that Mexicans grew up with from the 60's to the early 90's. And also, to clarify a lot of the comments, this movie is faaaaar from being racist!",Nacho Libre

This movies genre of humor may come off as immature and pointless, but I think if you know enough about comedy, you'll love and really understand why this movie is great. I'm not a huge Jack Black fan, but his character is outstanding. I wouldn't make this movie a novel or a musical, but I will laugh every time Esqueleto chucks corn into that old guy's eye socket. It is easy to see that this movie took time ,and effort to ensure that it was hysterical (ex. scenes ending abruptly, fake and cheesy sound effects, Ignacio's songs). I would also like to add that this movie is made to be racist, but maybe you might see it as that if you are racist yourself. I'm not a movie expert, but I love this movie, and I appreciate movies that are actually funny.",Nacho Libre
438,jodytoady1,You either get it or you don't...,10,20 July 2006,"I can understand why some would dislike this movie. I believe it is one that falls under one of two categories: Love it or Hate it. It is chuck full of the humor you either get or you don't. I am so thankful that I happen to be one who totally gets it. You will know in the opening scene whether you will get it or not. I must say this movie ""had me at hello"". Jack Black ROCKS as usual. Nacho Libre is good, ""REAL good. I love it! It's the best!!!"" If you didn't laugh all the way through Napoleon Dynamite and aren't a Jack Black fan - you probably won't get it. I have seen this movie 4 times and it keeps getting better. How many movies these days get better with each time you see it?...not too many. In order to enjoy this movie, you have to be able to RELAX and not take life so seriously.",Nacho Libre
439,lpollita,it is more than meets the eye,8,29 June 2006,"I laughed a lot with this movie, but I also liked how scenes are constructed: the way people dress, the people and places, the meaning of the ugliness of certain faces... It reminds me of a childhood where our heroes were closer to us than Superman or Spiderman, when we use to collect our plastic ""luchadores"" and play with them, when even our youngest uncle tried to be wrestler for a couple of months in the local arena and our grandma made him his costume... It reminds me of a certain ""underground"" culture within the Mexican culture which was not so forgotten about 30 or 40 years ago, when Santo and Blue Demon were true idols and even became movie stars... If you have seen the clothes and topics of such movies, you could realize that certainly the writers/directors of Nacho Libre watched some of those for inspiration.",Nacho Libre
440,ikegraham,Hilarious!,7,21 August 2006,"This movie was a pure joy to watch. I am still laughing at many of the parts while writing this. I get tired of mentioning Napoleon Dynamite when talking about Nacho Libre, but you kind of have to due to the pacing styles. Both movies have quite predictable and basic overall plot lines if you really think about it, but it is the way they use the most original characters and dialog to bring about the outcome that makes these movies standout. They are really in a class of their own and cannot be compared to mainstream comedies.If you watch this movie expecting the movie to keep you engrossed without much effort on your part, you will be let down. Although that sounds like a demeaning statement about movie, trust me it is not. Much like Napoleon Dynamite, the move paces slowly and uses many plain looking people to deliver monotone dialog in random and extremely hilarious ways.I can't speak for other people as every person is different, but the people I saw it with and I (as well as the theater crowd) were laughing while in the theater and while walking out of the theater. It was one of those experiences where everyone is sharing their favorite parts and it just keeps going on for 10 minutes. Maybe your experience will be different, but as for me I found unconventional originality and hilarity throughout Nacho Libre.",Nacho Libre
441,PRSguitarsR4me,Awful. Even for 5 year olds.,1,16 June 2006,"I was looking forward to this movie, and I walked out after 45 minutes. I kept on hoping that it would be funny, or at least Jack Black would be funny. He is not funny at all. The intended humor is him farting before jumping a cat-like chip thief, or him not looking where he's going on a homemade motorcycle and flying off a hill, or him wiping a handful of feces into a friends face. This kind of humor is intended for kindergarteners, and that is why the film is rated PG. But the film is meant to be understood by adults. Its directed by a Mormon, and there are plenty of hacks at the Catholic church. By the way, I'm not Catholic, I'm protestant, and very devout. The whole first half of the movie (which I saw) is a mockery of monks at a monastery type place. Jack Black is seen tearing a rosary off of a hook to make a shirt for his dream character, Nacho. The entire premise is immature, uncreative, and offensive. Any good parent wouldn't want their kids to see what is in this film, and any sane human wouldn't be entertained by this film in the slightest bit. I'm just happy I was barely able to get my money back for this complete waste of time. I think Jack Black is one of the most talented comedians in town, and his films School of Rock, Saving Silverman, and Orange County are extremely funny, but this is just lame, tasteless and again, offensive. I hope this comment has been useful, and this film is unrecommended at the utmost degree, from me, a huge film buff.",Nacho Libre
442,pianomn623,Falls short of expectations,4,26 June 2006,"I have to preface this by saying I'm a huge Jack Black and Tenacious D fan. I also loved Napoleon Dynamite. This movie just fell short of what I had hoped it would be.When it wasn't trying to make you laugh with slapstick humor, it felt like it was trying too hard to be subtly funny. It was like a couple of Hollywood Execs got together and said ""What if we combine School of Rock and Napoleon Dynamite."" Then someone else said ""yeah, and it would be funny to put it in Mexico. And put Jack Black in a wrestling costume."" The concept is funny, but in order to make a movie, you have to have substance which this film lacked.There were a few chuckles here and there throughout the movie but it did not live up to its promise. I felt very much like I did after walking out of the movie Unbreakable (M. Night Shyamalan's sophomore effort). You have a great first film that audiences love, followed by a second film that tries to recreate that magic and instead leaves a stale taste. By the time the movie gets to the gratuitous Jack Black moment (a la Tenacios D) they had already lost me as an audience member.One last note. The movie is labeled as a Nickelodeon Picture. That should give you an idea of who the movie was geared to and how the script was written. If you have a pre-teen boy absolutely take him to see it, he will love every minute of it. If you are looking for a movie with the magic, style, and humor of Napoleon Dynamite, do yourself a favor and just rent Napoleon Dynamite.",Nacho Libre
443,mescaline_uk,Good mindless comedy along the same lines as Austin Powers but not really as Clever,7,13 August 2006,"Frankly this isn't the kind kind of movie that deserves to be criticised by snobby film buffs, if you watch the trailer you'll know instantly what kind of movie it is.I personally enjoy a good mindless comedy along the same lines as Austin Powers (okay not as good as Austin Powers). It has quite a few cheap laughs as you'd expect (fat people, stretchy pants, crazy little midget people) but most of all I found the premise of the whole thing the main attraction. It's the kind of film movie-land will probably only visit once, and probably only Jack Black could have made work.Jack Blacks character takes himself very seriously, and there's a good old hackneyed storyline about the good of heart, albeit slightly incompetent hero struggling against the big guys. It's not just for laughs, you grow fond of his character and want him to succeed in his aims as he struggles for wrestling fame.I really want that frilly shirt. Where on EARTH did they get that. Top marks for the costume designers.Naturally you leave the cinema and the most impressed are the younger age groups and I did end up thinking it was perhaps a little brief.But hey, I enjoyed it, though admittedly I am a bit of a Jack Black fan.

446,ImaCritic824,Complete garbage,4,16 June 2006,"This film (if you can call it that) was a complete waste of my time. I cannot believe Jack Black even put his name on this piece of garbage. I work at a movie theatre and thank God because if I would've spent money to see this, I would've been really upset. I did not find one thing in this movie even remotely humorous and I like Jack Black and I have a good sense of humor. The only thing I enjoyed about this movie was trying to name wrestling moves that I remember from back when I was a WWF (now WWE) fan. Honestly, unless you are a die-hard Jack Black and/or Napolean Dynamite fan, please for your own sake, save your money. So if you really want to see Jack Black in some tights and no shirt on wrestling around with a bunch of midgets and Mexicans, then by all means see this trash, however if you want to save money for a decent movie such as The Fast and The Furious Tokyo Drift which was excellent, don't see Nacho Libre.One of my managers at the theater went to see Nacho Libre with his girlfriend and they walked out of the movie half an hour into it, it was so bad. We were contemplating on a publicity stunt, anyone who can sit through the entire showing of Nacho Libre will receive a free order of nachos after the show. HA!

The story is basic yeah, but there's more of a plot than Napolean Dynamite. (dont get me wrong that movie is also fantastic.)But yeah for reals Nacho Libre is great. Just see it not expecting the greatest movie alive and I guarantee you will wet yourself with joy. (I almost did). the bit with the two furry guys in the ring was almost too funny. It's definitely got the visual style of J Hess which just makes it fun to look at, and the soundtrack is amazing. The combo of the Hess' and Mike White writing is a good one.

The beginning was a little slow, but once it got moving, it was great. There are some memorable quotes in this movie that people will soon be saying, just like Napoleon Dynamite. Fun movie, go with a group. The directing was alright, and the dialogue was hilarious.

Nacho Libre is a spoof, but very accurate of these movies. The cheesy plot, the simple dialog, the characters, I just could not stop laughing so hard. Jack Black is awesome, how he captures the essence of the Mexican Wrestling Movie Hero, the masks, the names. To really appreciate Black's work and this movie, you must check out those old films, EL SANTO VS BLUE DEMON, or anyone with EL SANTO. You will see that wearing a wrestling mask WITH a leisure suit while dancing and drinking at a party was considered NORMAL!!! How the poor and abused were always the victims, how the hero, a underdog, battles the forces of evil to liberate the girl, the orphans (there always seems to be orphans in Mexican movies?) Jack Black really knows how to do cheesy, he picks up all the right moves, how they stand, how they stick their chest out, in all, he did his homework. This movie certainly will have it's cult following, me included, that we can just watch it over and over! Each time picking up something new! Some folks will just hate this film, simply because they do not understand were all this comes from, so if you really want to enjoy this film, do some research, check out the old EL SANTO movies and ENJOY!",Nacho Libre

Not only was the plot completely pointless, but the acting itself was terrible. Nacho's partner, Esquelito, could not act that he was in pain if he was actually shot,and the other actors did not offer much better. As a fan of Jack Black, I was expecting a performance in the caliber of School of Rock, and was sadly disappointed.The one and only point in the movie where I laughed was immediately before the final fight with Rameses, where Nacho sings a song he wrote for Encarnacion. The song was so completely pointless and stupid that it was actually entertaining.Overall, this movie was a sad attempt to capitalize on the successes of Napoleon Dynamite and other pointlessly comedic movies. It almost makes me wish the rating systems had a negative star rating for movies. A definite no-go.",Nacho Libre

I didn't really want to see it in the first place, but I usually like Jack Black and I thought it was better than waiting for a machine outside. I was wrong. It would've been better to stare at the wall for an hour and a half than follow Jack Black pretending to be Mexican as he stumbles through flat jokes and ridiculous ""comedic"" situations. I really wanted to sum this movie up in one line, as it's really all you need, but the minimum review length wouldn't allow me.

The supporting cast also does a fantastic job of moving the story along, and adding a quirky but real feeling to the entire film. Every person in the film doesn't go over the top in presentation.

Jack Black's ego controlled this thing--no traces of any imagination, save the imagination which puts a monk and a nun at the centre of a romance. At several points I was looking around the audience to see what the half-dozen or so people who were laughing at all were actually doing--it can't have been watching this piece of drivel. I liked him in School of Rock, loved High Fidelity, but the former had a heart and the latter had a script written by someone with a brain. This had a big man in tights who broke wind and snotted refried beans.

456,likeherod2,"Nacho Libre: A film that will be panned in error, mercilessly, for ""racism,"" but will shine in the end.",8,16 June 2006,"Okay, I got to tell you. Hess' ""Nacho Libre,"" was one of those most hilarious, poignant and intensely bizarre pieces of film I've seen in quite a while. First of all, the viewer is hit with an amazing song, which sadly and admittedly, I do not know. And on that note, the soundtrack never lets up. A major highlight in the film was ""Bat Macumba,"" by the Tropicalia-Psychedelia-Brazilian-Portugese-Mish-Mashin' band ""Os Mutantes."" The rest of the soundtrack never lets up, either. If you're a fan of the soundtracks from Wes Anderson films, you'll be eating up every song in the film, although Jack Black does pull a few Tenacious D stunts.Which leads me to the first, but least problematic issue this film faces. Jack Black. I am not entirely fond of him... But you can tell he is giving it his all in this film while having FUN at the same time (and by god, it's not racist. and by god, yet once more, it is not akin to black face.) His character is respectable, lovable, and even if you don't like Black - the actor, the comedian, the singer, he is an offbeat character with a struggle that you may be able to relate to in some way. You're here at IMDb, I won't bother to make this thing longer than it is explaining the story. And quite frankly, the film is so colorful, with the richest direction I haven't seen since Napolean Dynamite, or say, The Royal Tenenbaums.All of the actors, and even the extras, the scenery, the music, the comedy (sans a few fart gags that were fitted into the film for the younger viewers) are priceless and completely memorable. The film also touches lightly on religion in contrast to science. But it's so brief, and funny, it's not heavy-handed. This movie is something you walk out of feeling kind of good about life, and for the state of movie directors these days. Jared Hess, while he didn't pull off the next Napolean Dynamite, in terms of quotability, this is another film he can add as a notch on his belt as a promising, young director with a vision of his own (and it's a damn good, funny, enthralling, and quirky one.) To those unsure of the film from the commercials, or the word of mouth from people who probably haven't even seen the film yet, but call it ""racist,"" it isn't. I think it has something to do with the tensions running high regarding the immigration issue in the US. This movie, while I have no credentials to really sell you on it, is fun for you, me, and the family. It's a beautifully shot film, it's lovable, and very unpredictable; and you walk out feeling pretty good. More movies should kinda be doing that these days, don't you agree?",Nacho Libre
457,mazzingerz-se,You will enjoy this double as much if you are Mexican,9,2 February 2016,"This is a gem among too many movies trying to make comedy...those movies certainly deliver some good laughs but after you leave the movie theater the smile starts fading away and after a couple of days have past you barely remember you watched that movie...On the other hand, Nacho Libre delivers so many memorable moments! The humor is very Mexican which is ironic since some users complains about it being racist let me tell you that it was really enjoyed in Mexico because most of the people there ""got it"". American movies use stereotypes when it comes to Mexican that are not even accurate, like saying ""Ole"" or using a Flamenco hat(those are only used in Spain) or just putting actors that have Latino roots but their Spanish is far from Mexican Spanish (for ex. Benicio Del Toro)...it might not matter for US audience but the ones that know the difference between Mexican vs Central American or South American Spanish makes a big difference.Jared Hess uses real Mexican people and locations (Oaxaca, probably the poorest Mexican state but also one of the most beautiful), he seems to know Mexican culture well,the stuff they show is real Mexico the name of the kid is spot on, actually in Mexico everybody has a nickname and no one get offended, folks joke about their defects and no one gets hurt.The clothes, food, traditions and phrases spoken by Nacho are 100% grammatical correct so I would say that no American movie has ever being more respectful portraying Mexico that this movie...a movie about Mexico that actually feels Mexico. Mexico is a large country and has modern cities as well, but this was just the perfect place to tell the story of Nacho, it couldn't have taken place anywhere else. Mexican ""Luchadores"" in this movie remainds of real ones, one of them a legendary one but with a different color in the mask and I do not mean El Santo (which Jared was a fan as a kid) and the other remainds of a loyal companion but double as many although not as violent;-)Like I wrote, locations are beautiful so is the cinematography and the music, ohhh the music!This movie is for the whole family (although my kids got a little frighted by the ""violence"" on the ring since here is not common to see that kind of stuff), the innocence in Nacho is a pleasure to see, how good-hearted he is makes you happy, gives hope in a world full of so many ugly things. Friendship between him and his companion is fantastic. But don't misunderstand me, the humor is even more enjoyable for adults since only we get some of the jokes or see the craziness in them, humor is delivered in a way that makes it enjoyable for both young ones and adults.Secondary actors are fantastic as well!Kids learn more from this movie than watching some empty animated movie full of songs and about the same subject every time which somehow underestimates the capacity of analysis kids have. I rarely see movies twice, not year after year at least...I have only a bunch in that category: The Godfather I- II, Goodfellas, Once Upon a Time In The West, Dersu Uzala and a couple more...and yes: Nacho Libre.I laugh always so hard that my stomach hurts, the kid inside me enjoys this movie as much as my other part: the adult. I wish world leaders were more like Nacho, we all should be more like Nacho.",Nacho Libre

460,FutureBroadwayStar,Warning: May not be for your sense of humor,3,30 June 2006,"Allow me to preface this by saying I had a beer with dinner before I went to the movies. I had walked around the city all day long and was pretty tired already. The beer and the dark movie theater just added to it. This was a required staff outing that I could not get out of. I signed up to see Click but no one else signed up for it so I was forced to pick from this or Superman. I think I chose the lesser of two evils. My sense of humor does not span the Jack Black, Napoleon Dynamite, Jackass drama. Maybe it has to do with my teacher calling me a jackass in 3rd grade. But I just am not into it.I laughed once. In the party scene. The rest of the time I was squirming in my seat doing my best to stay awake because there was actually a plot. I thought Ana De la Ruguera was absolutely gorgeous and endearing. The child actor who played Chacho ... simply adorable. Other than that. This is a movie for a lot of people. It will certainly have a following. But that following will not include cute budding starlets like me who hang out in starbucks, sing to themselves on the street, and would rather see Click.",Nacho Libre

It's completely ridiculous and nonsensical, but if you have the right mind set (that being that this is a dumb movie with dumb jokes) you'll most likely enjoy yourself. It doesn't try to be something that it's not, it knows it's a stupid comedy with completely ridiculous jokes and it just is what it is. It's nothing great, really nothing special, no hidden meaning or religious messages it just kind of exist to exist. Just appreciate it for what it is. It has some outrageous jokes and some mediocre acting, but actually has a nice enjoyable plot with the main actors being as ridiculous as possible and honest a great soundtrack. Just trust me when I say to give it a watch, it's on Netflix and is short so you're really not wasting yo much of your time if you don't like it. A lot of great memorable moments and very nostalgic for me, and for me and my family it's a cult-classic.",Nacho Libre

I enjoyed watching Jack Black in several other movies such as School of Rock, Shallow Hal and King Kong so I figured this movie had to be funny at least even though I knew the plot was going to be weak. But this movie was so bad that after about an hour I finally had to quit watching it. I have watched a lot of dumb movies in my life, but at least most of them were funny. This one had nothing going for it. I recommend staying away from this film unless it is free and you are either really drunk or stoned.",Nacho Libre
465,davidlynched,Mucho NACHOooo...ooo...oo...o,9,18 June 2006,"Much loved Nacho Libre. It's cute, quirky, simple, outrageous, full-on funny, and obnoxiously sweet. It's got that realistic ""indie"" feel and a fun Mexican flavored acoustic pop soundtrack to match. This is more of a showcase for Jack Black than any movie he has made yet. He may be the star of the film and it may seem easy for a star to be the center of attention, but he steals every scene with such courageous comedic triumph that the movie becomes 90 minutes with one of the funniest friends you've ever had. If you like Jack Black you will love Nacho Libre. If you liked Napoleon Dynamite you will like Nacho Libre. If you like big budget summer blockbusters and nothing else, you will hate Nacho Libre. The casting for every character is perfect -- so perfect it almost seems to ""reel"" to be true. The thing I enjoy most about director Jared Hess' movies is that they are not ordinary. They are emotionally predictable but the circumstances are not, and his films are full of so many offbeat moments and bizarre characters that they develop a flavor of their own. If you could mix Napoleon Dynamite with the craziness of a Mexican circus, the humanity of a holy church, and a full course meal of Jack Black, then you've got a great recipe for the best movie nachos this side of the Hollywood border. Nacho Libre tastes great!",Nacho Libre

Jack Black is casted perfectly as a down-on-his-luck guy who only wants respect from his elders. Nacho loves to wrestle but unfortunately is blessed with an round belly. The comedy has the same Napoleon Dynamite sense of humor we all loved. You will laugh out loud every time Nacho and his skinny friend Esqueleto step into the ring and try to wrestle people four times bigger and stronger then they are.(most of the time) It's a funny, clean movie with a good message. The story is simple and easy to understand. The Theater that I was in was full of laughter and enjoyment. Jared Hess does it again with his tale of a true warrior destined for greatness. Nacho Libre is fun for the whole family.",Nacho Libre

468,supernatural_girl,A quiet little gem,8,27 September 2006,"Most fans of Jack Black (or so they call themselves) often come to expect the same thing over and over of him- stupid humor, and they're always let down when they don't get it. I can't count on both hands the amount of times I've seen someone claim to be a fan of Jack and then put down everything that doesn't attempt to offend at every turn. Perhaps if more fans of Jack could take a step back from their South Park style hopes and realise that Jack is capable of so much more, films like Nacho Libre would get the recognition they deserve.Luckily for the punter who expects more, there aren't that many crude moments, and most of them are fairly well developed enough to add to the picture. (Who would've thought there could be such a thing!?) Nacho Libre is a wonderful little flick- the script is simple and reminiscent of low-budget Spanish films, the visual style is fantastic, and the supporting cast are all so natural that quite a few times I forgot they were actors! Don't let the fact that it's compared to Napoleon Dynamite trick you into overlooking this one- everything missing in that film (likable characters, a plot with some dimension, funny jokes etc) can be found here.This film is very much like Jack himself- it's sweet, funny, sincere, highly amusing to watch and great to look at, all laced up under a mask of incredibly funny jokes. Again, like Jack, it has some stunted moments, almost as if it's not entirely sure of itself and decides to break out into something off-color or out and out weird, just to keep itself in check. But it all comes together nicely.Again, the only thing that could have made this better would be to edit out that perennial stand-by, the fart joke. Sure, once is funny, but once is enough. This film is worth so much more than these frat boy body humor jokes, though admittedly were probably only there to entertain those who came to see the film expecting something vapid and moronic.You don't have to be a serious Jack Black fan to like this film. If you can get past the immature stuff, you'll love it. And hey, sometimes gross-out jokes aren't so bad!",Nacho Libre
469,vandmic,Awesome,10,23 February 2017,Nacho Libre is a fun action filled family friendly movie. Starring Jack Black as Nacho Libre as an orphan in a orphanage in Mexico. Ever since he was a little boy he has dreamed of becoming a louche lour(Mexican wrestler) but the religion of his orphanage forbids it. The leader of the orphanage says it is not the lords way. The orphanage is running low on money and food so all they get to eat is muck and chips. Nacho is tired of it so he sets out to be a louche lour. One day he is in an alleyway grabbing the chips for the orphans he is attacked by a scrawny hobo named Stephen Nacho realizes his speed and great strength. They become partners and there training begins. There first fight comes around and it turns out they aren't very good Nacho is angry but Stephen doesn't really care. The referee comes out and throws them a pack of money and they realize this could be the turning point for the orphanage watch the movie to find out. This movie is action filled hilarious and family friendly if you like all of those things this is the movie for you!,Nacho Libre

If people don't like it - OK; but there is no spite nor hate nor exploitation here. Watch it with an open mind.Jack Black's accent is dodgy; but he plays Nacho with real passion. I expected him to showboat his musical skills, but thankfully he stayed in character as someone with enormous ambition, a little too much pride, and modest ability. The movie is very funny - from fond smiles to real belly laughs. When analysed the plot's similar to but more plausible than any po-faced super hero film. And Sister Encarnacion - well, it would be too sinful to comment.",Nacho Libre
471,tigertigerz,A really awesome movie. It was brilliant. You have to see it.,9,16 June 2006,"I saw at this movie on opening night (which is actually still tonight) and I was really sure if it was going to be good or just really moronic. It turned out to be a awesome movie, if you are thinking about seeing it, you should definitely go, it was really funny. It has randomness and you really noticed lots of classic and original Jack Black elements. A brief summary of this movie would be, Nacho (Black) is a man who was raised in a orphanage/church who was forced to make everyone their meals, but since he is given no money the food takes terrible. He has a passion for wrestling but no one takes him serious and ignores it (don't think this is a crappy movie where the main character wins every thing then goes to the championship game and wins but by a last ball or right before time runs out, basically the opposite of that). A nun comes to teach at the school that Nacho instantly has feelings for. Nacho teams up with a street rat and train hard in an attempt to win money. In the end, lessons are learned, you have laughed a lot, and your sure you watched a great movie. I don't want to spoil anything, but go see Nacho Libre as soon as you can! PS. This movie is definitely in the same league (or greater if you didn't like the following) as School of Rock or King Kong.",Nacho Libre

I'm not surprised to see some critics (Roger Ebert for example) are not giving the movie the best reviews. It's not unusual that a movie the critics love turns out to be one I don't care for or vice versa.Little things in the movie are funny...The outfit Nacho wears on his night out - the white pants, white shoes and the baby blue sweater with the dickey-like turtleneck, is hilarious and perfect. The shelter that Nacho made of sticks when he went into the ""wilderness"" and the fact that he's basically in someone's backyard make that scene funny. His attempt to save Sister Encarnación from the bad guys in a pre-arranged plot he and Esqueleto cooked up to impress her is good for some laughs when he mistakenly confronts a couple of innocent people passing by.It's a fun summer movie that has some good guy bad guy action, a little bit of a commentary on religion or at least piety, a couple of catchy songs and a leading man who reminds me of a mix of Errol Flynn, Ricardo Montalban, a not quite so manic Jerry Lewis and John Belushi.",Nacho Libre

OK so there was a story, Nacho (Jack Black) wants to be respected so he decides to be a mask wrestler. He joins forces with a homeless man (Héctor Jiménez) and together they become the worst tag team in the world! Nacho ends up going up against the world's greatest masked wrestler, I won't tell you how it ends, well I should because it would stop you going to see it. But I won't.

I'm impressed with the acting. It was funny, spicy, and feisty. A lot of which is greatly appreciated among my people (Jack Blackers). I thought at first Jack was surrounded by Spanish speaking people and WOW, I looked it up-- I have research-- but this man speaks a beautiful imitation of that of a Mexican accent. Lovely. Read me bedtime stories, Jack.Anyway, referring to the rest of the film-- people, calm down! It wasn't meant for its literal reference to religion and wrestling, but rather a satirical based film in which it pokes a good balance of playful fun and a touch of reality.Ever have a bad day?

If those people smiled that ridiculous smile one more time I think I would have screamed and pulled my hair out. There are moments that you could chuckle but they come so few and far between that by the time it comes around again you've settle into a nice deep sleep. Toward the end during the ""big fight"" it wanders into ""Rocky"" territory with the guy getting beat up then conquering in the end and that is the most entertaining part of the movie. Personally I liked Napoleon Dynamite and expected to like this because I can appreciate some of what Jack Black has done in the past. However, this was so painful I really felt angry about going.

I will note that I went with several people who did not like Napolean Dynamite at all, and they were on the fence about Nacho. However, I fell in love with ""Napolean Dynamite"" only after I had seen it a second time. I think the same will happen with Nacho. The best part of both Napolean and Nachois that both movies have excellent facial expressions and the quotable one liners.People were laughing throughout the movie and when I got out I thought it was decent, but as time passed it got better and better in my mind as I thought back on it.Maybe if you gave this movie 4-6 stars or saw some potential, you should check it out again.",Nacho Libre

(The butt thrusts scene, also in one of the commercials, is hilarious) There are people who claim this movie is racist, and the director Jared Hess is racist, but that's just because they want something to complain about. This is a good natured movie, and is in no way derogatory to the Mexican/Spanish culture.If there's one movie that you HAVE to see this summer, make it Nacho Libre, because a movie this well put together needs to be seen.

For those not familiar with this format, there is inevitably too much humor about bodily functions and the struggle of a pudgy misfit that does not mesh with ""normal"" society. Once you get past this, Nacho Libre is actually an enjoyable movie if you enjoy seeing interesting characters develop and grow. Each main character struggles and grows in ways that are not immediately obvious. The background is not typical for most American movies. However, if your taste in comedy is slapstick, Nacho Libre will disappoint.

I just knew it was a Jack Black movie, and he has always been good for some laughs. Would be funny to see a sequel, maybe.

Jack Black may at times go over the top but he more than makes up for it with some moments of real genius. Besides the obvious jokes there's an intelligent, awkward humor here for those who look for it. Some critics are saying the plot is too predictable. C'mon. This is often an issue with critics trying to take storytelling in comedies too seriously. If a comedy succeeds in making you laugh all the way through, who the heck cares?

This movie may have been better if Jack Black would have stayed behind the scenes as only a producer...basically he is horrible and needs to not be in movies anymore...either that or get a way to play a character.

I might have enjoyed it more because I'm a wrestling fan, but I think any person will love this movie. It is very unique and clever. Jack Black pulled off the part in flying colors(Literally). I felt that a lot of heart was put into making this movie and you can see that when you watch it. A must-see for anyone looking to have a great time at the movies.

And there's plenty of over-the-top, just plain stupid.On the plus side, I took my 15 year old and wasn't embarrassed at any time during the movielots of gas passing but no crude sexual behavior, no cursing and there was a positive message about living for a bigger, better purpose.I don't regret the money I spent to see this movie, there were certainly some funny, memorable moments, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone over the age of twenty.",Nacho Libre

It was bland and thin on any genuine humour. It was predictably based on the ugly duckling surviving the odds and becoming the swan at the end. Albeit a still ugly swan. Hollywood has got to get past this formula comedy routine. Jack Black should have brought more to the role and really made an impact, as there aren't too many comedic talents in Hollywood these days. He had a chance to shine considering the movie was really bereft of any known talent. To me it looked like he had watched a couple of old Abbott and Costello/Three Stooges Movies and tried to emulate that style of slapstick, but it never really gets to those dizzy heights. Shame, but will be interested to see what he does next. Pass on this one, but if you are bored out of your mind - its OK.",Nacho Libre

Unless you think Jack Black is the funniest man alive, stay away. This is nothing but a vehicle for his shtick, and the rest is filler. See Jack sing! See Jack do funny voices! There's a very thin 'plot' that meanders and eventually loses track of itself. The majority of the film borrows from the lack of point in Napolean Dynamite and the hope that cute children will distract you from Black ala School of Rock. There's no character development, which is especially irritating when you have no idea what motivates the two main characters. I didn't enjoy a single moment of the entire thing.

We are ( WERE) fans of Black but none of us did more than mange a forced titter for the duration.

I laughed so much that I cried. When the movie was over, I was still laughing with tears. I had to wipe my face before the lights came back on. I came home and I still felt the laughter. Just like Napoleon Dynamite, it had those rare lines that you continue to quote afterwards. It's amazing how Nickalodeon can create a movie for both kids and adults. My 5 year old daughter actually picked this movie over Pixar Cars. I will definitely buy this when it comes out on DVD. This has got to be Jack Black at his best. I will highly Recommend this movie to anyone.",Nacho Libre
