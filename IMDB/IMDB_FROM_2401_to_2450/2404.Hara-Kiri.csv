0,MartinHafer,"Sort of an ""Anti-Samurai"" flick",8,15 October 2006,"This film was very well-made and the story is excellent. The story begins with a man asking his local warlord permission to commit ritual suicide. His reason is that the country has been at peace so long that ronin (out of work and master-less Samurai) have no income and nothing to do. So, instead of the indignity of just wasting away, a vicious and painful suicide is apparently the best option! Instead of instantly granting this request, the Counselor tells the suicidal ronin about a similar request that occurred recently and how the ronin who killed himself probably only asked for permission to die as a ruse to get money from the warlord! In other words, this other man had hoped that his request would NOT be granted and he would instead been given a small income. But, not wanting to see the Bushido code perverted, the warlord demanded that this man commit ritual suicide--even though the sword the ronin had was made of bamboo and doing the painful ritual was super-painful and difficult with such a sword.This story was pretty interesting but how it related to this second ronin is what makes this story so interesting. Plus, I loved how the story ended.Overall, I think this is a bit of an ""anti-Samurai"" film, as it talked how adherence to the rules of Bushido actually could be very cruel and violate the spirit of the feudal system. The inherent cruelty and desire to only worry about appearances instead of right and wrong make this an excellent and intriguing movie. Good stuff.",Hara-Kiri
1,SnoopyStyle,horrific scene,7,28 January 2015,"It's 1630. There is peace in the land and many samurai have become poor homeless vagrants. Hanshiro Tsugumo is a samurai whose clan has fallen. He comes to the home of a feudal clan to ask permission to commit seppuku within the courtyard. Kageyu Saito is a senior counsel and he tries to deter the man with the story of another ronin Motome Chijiiwa from the same clan. They forced him to do the job despite he has sold his blade. All he has is a blade made of bamboo. It's a brutal painful event. Nevertheless, Hanshiro insists on continuing with his seppuku and then he reveals that he did indeed know Motome.The first recollection is actually quite compelling. It catches my attention culminating in one of the most memorable horrific scenes. The rest of the movie can't really compare. It's another series of recollections and it's not as compelling. I think it would be just as good to compress the second half and keep the big final fight.",Hara-Kiri
2,claudio_carvalho,A Heartbreaking and Tragic Story of Poverty and Revenge,10,3 February 2012,"In 1630, after a long period of peace in Japan after the end of the clans, thousand of samurais do not have masters and are living in absolute poverty. The ronin Hanshiro Tsugumo (Tatsuya Nakadai) and former samurai of Lord of Geishu arrives at the house of Lord Lyi requesting a spot to commit hara-kiri (an honorable form of suicide through self-inflicted disembowelment followed by decapitation under the samurai code).Tsugumo is received by Umenosuke Kawabe (Yoshirô Aoki), who tells the story of the young samurai Motome Chijiiwa (Akira Ishihama) that arrived at the house also asking for a place to commit hara-kiri but expecting to receive coins instead. The warrior Hikokuro Omodaka (Tetsurô Tanba) convinces the clan to force Chijiiwa to really commit suicide using his bamboo blade as an example to other samurais that would appear using the same pretext to receive coins from the master.Tsugumo discloses that the lad Chijiiwa was his son-in-law that was forced to the situation expecting to raise some money to treat his sick wife and baby son. Further, Tsugumo had arrives in the house expecting to die not committing suicide, but revenging Chijiiwa, his daughter and his grandson.""Harakiri"" is a heartbreaking and tragic story of poverty and revenge in a period when Japan was ruled by the Tokugawa clan and thousand of samurais lost their work with the fall of the clans. This film is a little masterpiece based on the wealthy history and culture of Japan and the screenplay uses flashbacks and gives an explanation of this period of story for those that do not have a minimum knowledge of the history of Japan. The Internet is a useful tool to understand the big picture of this historical moment.The acting is top-notch and the cinematography in black and white is magnificent. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): Not Available",Hara-Kiri
3,classicsoncall,"""I came here with every intention of dying.""",8,4 March 2018,"Unlike all the Kurosawa films I've seen, this one has a principal protagonist that announces his intention early in the story and then takes the viewer on a stunning journey of revenge that's entirely unexpected. Director Masaki Kobayashi prepares the viewer with a preliminary accounting of the fate of thousands of unemployed Samurai as a result of the 17th Century dissolution of the Japanese Shogunate. Masterless Samurai, or ronin, appear at the doorstep of a feudal lord requesting a place in which to perform ritual suicide, but for the dishonorable, this effort is merely a ploy to accept some small token of monetary value before moving on. ""Harakiri"" tells the story of two such ronin, and until we learn the true relationship of both men to each other, the viewer is at a loss to understand the real motivation of Hanshiro Tsugumo (Tatsuya Nakadai). With frequent forays into the past utilizing a series of flashbacks, Tsugumo relates the story of his son-in-law, helpless in the face of his wife's deteriorating physical condition and unable to seek medical attention for their sick baby due to lack of resources. What I found quite clever about the story was the absence of the three men Tsugumo called for to be his seconds for the purpose of hara-kiri. One realizes that it can't be simple coincidence that none of these men are available, as the story swerves to a desperate climax that pits Tsugumo against the entire House of Iyi. What would have been a tremendous let down in the story is avoided when Tsugumo follows through on his original mission, unable to physically overpower all the retainers employed by the clan's Master. So many films have the story's hero defeat an overwhelming number of rival opponents that it reduces the credibility factor to zero. At the point Tsugumo knows he can no longer pursue a fight strategy, he takes his life in the ritual manner. For followers of Japanese cinema, this film is a must see, with it's emphasis on honor, loyalty and embracing the truth of one's convictions. Tsugumo's unselfish final act unmasks the hypocrisy of the feudal lord's position, and mocks the cowardice of it's counselor Saito (Rentarô Mikuni). An appropriate amount of swordplay attends the story without becoming excessive, allowing for the more subtle aspects of Tsugumo's strategy to take over the narrative, which it does in compelling fashion.",Hara-Kiri
4,gavin6942,Sadly Overlooked,9,7 January 2015,"An elder ronin samurai (Tatsuya Nakadai) arrives at a feudal lord's home and requests an honorable place to commit suicide. But when the ronin inquires about a younger samurai (Akira Ishihama) who arrived before him things take an unexpected turn.For many, samurai films may be closer associated with Kurosawa... but this one, possibly the best ever made, comes from Masaki Kobayashi. How does Kobayashi not have the same level of international fame as Kurosawa? Interestingly, Hanshirō is able to fight off a great many retainers with a sword, yet is helpless against three guns; this is a foreshadow of the Meiji Restoration, wherein sword-bearing samurai were defeated by the ""new"" Japanese military. Indeed, the whole notion of ""honor"" and all that comes with it is radically changed once the battles become uneven.",Hara-Kiri
5,grantss,Not your average samurai drama,8,26 May 2019,"A samurai, Hanshiro Tsugumo, arrives at the house of the Iyi Clan with an unusual request. Due to his circumstances, he wishes to commit harakiri, ritual suicide, in the courtyard of the house. Turns out this is not such an unusual request: the clan has had such requests before, though the requestor's intentions weren't always honourable. The Clan elder tells Tsugumo the story of the last samurai who made the request and how that ended. Will he still go through with it?Not your average samurai drama. Slow-burning, plot-filled and relatively light on action, this movie will come as a bit of a surprise to most. This doesn't make it less interesting though. In fact, it makes it better.Instead of a basic plot that's just an excuse for heap of well-choreographed action scenes, the plot here is great, and quite poignant. The action is held back until the end, heightening the anticipation. The action scenes themselves are quite realistic - none of the ridiculous Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon stuff - and have a plausible outcome.On the negative side, the slow-burn does get drawn out a touch too long. In addition, in the end there's no clear message - the conclusion is a bit flat.Overall, a great movie.",Hara-Kiri
6,morrison-dylan-fan,"""Swordsmanship untested in battle, is like the art of swimming on dry land.""",10,11 June 2020,"A few years ago I looked online for some good offers,and picked up a Criterion release for a title I've not heard of before. Arriving in a white case with the title in small font, I put it on the end of a shelf before leaving,where it remained lost for years! Rearranging things during Lockdown, I was surprised to discover that this film had been facing me the whole time.View on the film:Bringing the sword down on this adaptation of Yasuhiko Takiguchi's novel by titling Hanshiro Tsugumo ""The ronin from Hiroshima"", the screenplay by Shinobu Hashimoto brings the defiance against authority in post-WWII Japan to the early beginnings, of what would become a consolidation of power, leading to the 250 year Tokugawa reign.Seating Hanshiro face to face with Saito in the house of Li Clan palace, the poetic dialogue Hashimoto balances the blade with the refine allegorical brutal, feudal authority of the Li Clan being used to rip the other clans and samurai's of the land apart, leading to Hashimoto striking back,and exposing the fragility from shattering their orders.Bringing Hanshiro into the palace pledging to commit harakiri, Hashimoto skilfully blades the allegorical with a absolutely thrilling samurai tale, drawing Hanshiro's compassion for his family with a fierce, passionate fire to fight and save the individualism of his family, up against the authoritative band of Li Clan.Saying later in a interview with Joan Mellen in 1972 that ""In any era, I am critical of authoritarian power."" directing auteur Masaki Kobayashi reunites with cinematographer Yoshio Miyajima, and stylishly displays his rebellion against authoritarian rule with the empty suit of armor hanging above the Li Clan palace like a gargoyle, which Kobayashi brings crashing down to earth via Hanshiro throwing the façade of power from the armor,right back at Li Clan.Cutting Toru Takemitsu's score to sparse inserts, Kobayashi displays a expertise in the use of silence, filling the Li Clan palace with Hanshiro's anguished words, being only interrupted by the lone sound of wooden panels being stepped on as guards rush to Saito's side.Igniting a lit fuse atmosphere which ends in a thrilling final fight, (where real swords were used!) that breaks the walls of the Li Clan palace, Kobayashi begins to shake the foundation with long static camera shots a few feet from the floor listening to Hanshiro, that Kobayashi starkly cracks with tightened close-ups on Hanshiro's agonised face,and refined zoom-ins on the terror sinking into Saito's face.Reuniting with Kobayashi,Tatsuya Nakadai gives a incredibly raw performance as Hanshiro, thanks to the love and warmth Hanshiro gives to his family, being contrasted by Nakadai with a simmering rage to fight for freedom freed from harakiri",Hara-Kiri
7,zetes,Stunning work,9,12 April 2002,"Harakiri is a little slow, but stick with it. The film is exquisite in every way. Kobayashi's direction is simply beautiful. The camera movement is original, exciting, and effective. The script and its characters are endlessly complex. And Tatsuya Nakadai is great, as always.",Hara-Kiri
8,lasttimeisaw,Film Review - Harakiri (1962) 8.5/10,9,16 October 2020,"""Most actions are confined in the palace's courtyard and other indoor spaces, HARAKIRI flags up Kobayashi's optimal stagecraft, the geometrical blocking of actors, the wide-screen spatial compositions, stationary but never feel constricted; when the actor moves, like in the final one-against-many mêlée, everything is crystallized to a T, the minutely calibrated choreography, the lethal slash and damage caused by the swordplay, and Nakadai's total abandon into a bleeding beast and desperate iconoclast. In a sense, the set piece is even more extraordinary than Kurosawa's best offers in YOJIMNO and SEVEN SAMURAI, because Hanshiro is outnumbered, doomed, a forlorn hope who fights until his last breath, a hero whose valor and integrity will not be extolled but buried, but when the dust settles, we actually feel triumphant for him, what a glorious death!""",Hara-Kiri
9,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Honour as punishment.,7,3 July 2020,"Essentially a condemning statement on the falsity of the samurai's supposed 'code of honour' and the concept of an 'honourable' death, this slow-burning drama sees a man recount his life as he prepares to take it in a ritualistic 'harakiri' ceremony. The tragedy of 'Harakiri (1962)' is profound and, as it moves from one phase to the next, it manages to emotionally affect in some surprising ways. It's a really layered piece, one with a multitude of intertwining themes and hard-won messages. The few sequences of violence it has are suitably brutal and exciting. They're grounded yet stylish, visceral yet thrilling, devastating yet inevitable. Arguably, the movie's most effective moment is an early example of its eponymous act, as a young man is forced to commit 'seppuku' in an incredibly cruel way. This scene is really difficult to sit through, to be honest, and it becomes even worse when the narrative revisits the reasoning behind its circumstances. The film is slow paced but it isn't boring. It's an interesting, entertaining but heavy affair. 7/10",Hara-Kiri
10,ThomasDrufke,"""What befalls others today, may be your own fate tomorrow.""",9,22 July 2020,"While not being a Kurosawa samurai film, Harakiri is an unbelievably great entry for the genre, and perhaps one of the more forgotten ones of the mid 20th century. A tale of revenge, honor, and one samurai's quest to avenge a potential tragedy is a calm, thought-provoking and intricate samurai film that will stay with you long after the credits roll. This is one of the greats.9.0/10",Hara-Kiri
11,gbill-74877,Beautiful and works on many levels,8,30 November 2016,"What is more dishonorable, out of work Samurai (Ronin) asking a clan to commit hara-kiri in their courtyard out of a desire to gain employment, with no intention of committing the act, or those in houses being cruel to them? When the country dishonors its Samurai, and they are driven to acts of desperation, leading to cruelty and further dishonor, the country spirals, and this movie set in 17th century seems to reflect decline in then present day (1962) Japan.The movie is quite beautiful visually, with traditional Japanese architecture and at one point a swaying bamboo forest framed beautifully by director Masaki Kobayashi. The story is taut and works on many levels, first and foremost as a vengeance with honor tale, which might remind you of an American Western, including a couple of epic battle scenes. It also has the individual man, disillusioned and saying that the Samurai code he lives by is a façade, and yet acting honorably, against a multitude misled by corrupt leaders. It's one against many in a battle that is timeless and certainly relevant today, and whose results are sadly akin to the entropy of the universe. ""Who can know the depths of another man's heart?"" the Samurai asks, signaling a need for empathy. Indeed.",Hara-Kiri

It tells a simple at first look story, but later it becomes more layout and complicated then it looks. Acting was great as well as directing, cinematography and directing.

13,briancham1994,Gripping critique of bushido,9,4 July 2021,"This film ranks as a masterpiece among samurai films for its humanistic critique of the rigid, hierarchical bushido code of conduct. The samurai who espouse this code are depicted as either malicious or enslaved by its snare - reduced to begging or arbitrarily enforcing it as a tool of humiliation. The story unfolds in a gradual way, revealing how all the characters have interacted in the past, bringing a lot of context to the situation in the courtyard. This is all punctuated with skillful cinematography of claustrophobic architecture, heartfelt acting and desperate swordfights.",Hara-Kiri
14,eddie_baggins,A genuine samurai classic.,9,26 October 2020,"Firmly entrenched in movie bible IMDB's Top 250 Films of All-Time list, Masaki Kobayashi's anti-samurai film remains to this day a stunningly crafted achievement that subverts its genre's expectations to give us a samurai film that favors talking and mystery over sword play and sensationalising.Set in the 17th century where newfound peace in the Japanese landscape has forced many samurai warriors that were previously hired for their bloodthirsty skill-sets to be forced out of work and large portions of them seeking to perform a ritual suicide known as seppuku, Harakiri (named for its referencing of this suicidal act) introduces us to a samurai clan working in the house of Lord Lyi as the clan plays host to a humiliating act of the seppuku of a young warrior that eventually leads to the arrival of the mysterious Hanshiro Tsugumo who too seeks to perform his last act in the house.Played out at a quiet but steady pace, Yoshio Miyajima steady camera work capturing every moment and Tôru Takemitsu's unnerving and perfectly suited score working alongside it, Harakiri is one of the era's most proficiently constructed affairs that may at times seem as though its headed for predictable outcomes only to change course unexpectedly throughout as its heartbreaking and confronting narrative takes place around Tatsuya Nakadai's tortured and determined Hanshiro.Working as both an unflinching examination of the samurai code and also as an exploration of post Japanese sentiment in the aftermath of their countries moving forward in the wake of World War 2 and their acceptance of long-forged laws, regulations and traditions, Harakiri evolves from its seemingly simplistic set-up to become an allergy and nuanced deep-dive into the countries history while at all times remaining a haunting character examination.Steering well clear of the over acting and hastily put together aspects that haunted many other similar productions and products of this era in general, Kobayashi's guiding hand help craft Harakiri into an ageless and captivating piece of movie-making, with the underrated Nakadai delivering one of Japanese cinema's great leading turns and the collective supporting cast all bringing their characters to life with carefully considered and well attuned performances.Unafraid to explore its dark themes and moments (a drawn out and horrifying suicide at the hand of a bamboo sword is still hard to sit through in today's more tolerant environment), Harakiri is deserving of its lauded reputation, even if many other higher profile ""samurai"" themed films outshine it in the general public spectrum.Final Say -A film best watched with as little knowledge as possible leading into it, Harakiri is a powerful and confronting piece of Japanese cinema that has remained relevant and required viewing these many years on since its release.4 1/2 bamboo knives out of 5",Hara-Kiri
15,SAMTHEBESTEST,A Legendary tale from Japanese Cinema on Samurai Honour and Traditional Facade.,8,14 September 2020,"HARAKIRI (1962) :
Brief Review -A Legendary tale from Japanese Cinema on Samurai Honour and Traditional Facade. This is the Best Samurai Film i have ever seen till date. I mean it by all intellectual angles irrespective of what legacy other Samurai Films like ""Seven Samurai"" and ""Yojimbo"" carries. Harakiri made me feel the pain into Mysterious narrative and exposed the malicious traditional honour and abrogates. The characters study and subtle meaning in Samurai films couldn't have got better than this. In 133 minutes of runtime, Harakiri tells a story of a Ronin who requests to perform Harakiri at feudal lord's palace. This brutal suicide theory turns into a tight slap to all Ancient theories which have been worshiped by brutal lords and arrogant ronins. Action, drama, Mystery, Social Message and what not to expect from one narrative and Harakiri gets everything right on top. Tatsuya Nakadao in leading role is fantastic from the start and the protagonist Tetsuro Tamba is humanly evil as hell. The supporting cast does well in limited space and mostly in action sequences which have been performed on slow mode to have realistically elegant look. The film is set in 17th century and thankfully I don't know nothing about the Japanese culture from that era to point out faults in production design. However, the film mostly takes place in that one palace so even that production design part of nuances set in specific era didn't bother much to my brain. It all looks fine under one roof and one place. This is my first film of Director Masaki Yobakashi and undoubtedly it turned out to be an unforgettable experience. Harakiri is Masaki's only film in IMDb Top 250 Rated list (if I'm not wrong) and it deservingly holds it's ground and will hold it for years. I am trying to remember the legendary films made in 60s decade all over the world and at the moment i think Harakiri would be in Top 3 in my list. Strongly Recommended to matured Cinema lovers.RATING - 8.5/10*By - #samthebestest",Hara-Kiri
16,jamesrupert2014,Excellent atypical Samurai film,9,24 September 2016,"Harakiri tells the story of vengeance with a minimum of action (but a surprising amount of blood for a early '60s film). The flashback based story is well told, Tatsuya Nakadai is excellent as the down-and-out samurai slowly unravelling his tale, and the black and white film is beautiful to watch, especially the last showdown. The Samurai film genre lends itself to comparison to the American ""western"" and, with its emphasis on the plight of the destitute ronin, Harakiri could be likened to the early revisionist oaters. Highly recommended, especially before or after a viewing of one of the Japanese versions of ""47 Ronin"" (personally, I like the lengthy, understated 1941 version).",Hara-Kiri
17,noralee,Samurai Genre is Used to Exposively Indict Japanese Politics and Culture,10,16 September 2005,"I saw Harakiri (Seppuku) in a new 35 mm print at NYC's Film Forum. This is a brilliant use of a narrow period genre to explosively indict politics and culture. Writers Shinobu Hashimoto and Yasuhiko Takiguchi surely must have been as inspired by ""The Count of Monte Cristo,"" Ambrose Bierce and Howard Hawks' Westerns as much as by samurai literature and movies.The film begins deceptively as a story within a story, seemingly providing a traditional example of upholding samurai honor, such as in the conventional, oft-retold tale of ""The 47 Ronin."" The context is set at a time when the central government, the shogunate, is supplanting local clans and arbitrarily unemploying thousands of people, notably their samurai, forcing them into the mercenary mode of ronin at best and begging for food at worse. But the parallels to the 20th century are made repeatedly explicit as the samurai who comes to this clan seeking help is from Hiroshima.Very gradually we get further insight on the tale within a tale, as we see more flashbacks within flashbacks into what each character has been doing before these confrontations and we get uneasy inklings that the moral of the story may not be what it appears at first and the stakes get higher and higher with almost unbearable tension.It is almost halfway through the film until we see a female and we suddenly see an alternative model of masculinity, where a priority is put on family, support, education and creative productivity. In comparison to the macho opening relationships, with their emphasis on formal militaristic loyalty to a hierarchy, a loving husband and father is practically a metrosexual. Seeing the same stalwart samurai making casual goo goo sounds to his grandbaby puts the earlier, ritualized scenes in sharp relief, particularly the recurring image of the clan's armor which seems less and less imposing and is finally destroyed as an empty symbol.The psychological tension in the confrontations in the last third of the film is more excruciating than the actual violence. Even when we thought we already knew the outcome from the flashbacks, the layers of perception of relationships and personalities are agonizingly peeled away with each thrust of a sword to reveal the depths of the horrifying hypocrisy of the political and social structure. And those are just the overwhelming cultural resonances that a 21st century American can glean. Like ""Downfall (Der Untergang),"" it reveals the inhumane mentality that led to World War II.The repeating motif of long walks then confrontations down empty corridors emphasizes the stultifying bureaucratic maze that entraps the characters. The revenge motifs are accented by startlingly beautiful cinematography that recalls traditional Japanese art, including drops of blood like first snow flakes then a waterfall.The over all effect of this masterpiece is emotionally draining.",Hara-Kiri
18,Kdosda_Hegen,Brutal. One of the darker japanese movies,9,10 April 2020,"Best samurai movie I have ever seen. The writting was amazing, it's breathtaking at moments, action scenes while dated still feel awesome. Great cinematography, sound design and setting.

20,lastliberal-853-253708,"What befalls others today, may be your own fate tomorrow.",9,29 November 2011,"I think it was in Zorro, the Gay Blade, that George Hamilton said, ""The Lord must love the poor because he made so many of them."" In this outstanding film, it is the struggles of the poor that are the prime focus, and the way in which they continue to maintain their honor and pride as they are forced to take menial tasks or watch their loved ones die due to lack of money.It is also timely as the poor we are talking about were the former Samurai who were forced into poverty as their jobs were eliminated by the Shogunate.These newly poor then, as now, are demonized as unworthy, ignoring the fact that it was society that made them poor, and society that made them unable to retain other work except for the most menial tasks. They were often reduced to begging, and that is how the story opens.The story is not what is seems at first as we soon find there is much more than we first imagined.Make no mistake, it includes some great action that one expects to see in a Samurai film, but that is not as important as Shinobu Hashimoto's dialog. It was captivating.The film is an indictment of the class system and it's so-called ""honor."" It also shows the mentality that lead to World War II. It is a film that will captivate you and anger you.The acting is superb, the score amazingly good, and the black and white cinematography first rate.Tatsuya Nakadai (Ran, Yojimbo) was outstanding in the lead role, and Masaki Kobayashi's direction ranks him among the best in Japan.",Hara-Kiri

22,Galina_movie_fan,Disharmony of Sword and Pen,10,21 March 2007,"I've said it once about another movie, incidentally by the other great Japanese director as well and I want to repeat my words in regard to ""Harakiri"": ""There are good, very good, and even great movies. But among them there are just a few that go beyond great. They belong to the league of their own"". Masaki Kobayashi's ""Harakiri"" aka ""Seppuku"" is one of them. The film of rare power and humanism, of highest artistic achievements, profoundly moving, tragic like the best Shakespeare's plays, universal and timeless even if it takes place in the faraway country of 1630, by the words of one of the reviewers ""Harakiri"" ""is to cinema as the Sistine Chapel is to painting. Unsurpassable!"" The film grabbed me from the very first shot, from its opening credits with their perfect harmony of kanji (I believe it is a correct word to describe the writings) characters, with the unusual disturbing score and with the dark beauty of the images. And then the story begins that centers on Hanshiro Tsugumo (Tatsuya Nakadai), one of hundreds or maybe even thousands unemployed lord less samurais, ronin, that in the blessed times of peace had not many choices to adjust to new life and often preferred to commit a ritual suicide, hara-kiri or seppuku on the property of the wealthy estate owners. According to Bushido, the way of the samurai, ""One who is a samurai must before all things keep constantly in mind, by day and by night . . . the fact that he has to die. That is his chief business."" At the same time, samurai and anti-samurai film, ""Harakiri"" offers the masterfully screened scenes of sword-fights, not plentiful but exquisitely choreographed, perfectly paced and unbearably intense but the film is much more than that. It is also a gripping court drama where the truth is unfolded in the flashbacks. The viewers are allowed to look closer at the noble Samurai code of behavior and to reflect on how its abuse impacts the fate of an individual and the society in general. Compelling, poetic, and tragic, the movie has one of the most pessimistic endings ever that makes you wonder how the history is made, how the historical events are interpreted and who decides what would be written in the chronicles and important documents and what would be left out.A Masterpiece, one of the best movies ever made, ""Harakiri"" deserves all its praise. It is not in my nature to force my opinion on anyone but if you call yourself a movie buff or a movie lover, you MUST see this film.",Hara-Kiri
23,bkrauser-81-311064,A Daring Repudiation of Collective Hubris,9,27 March 2016,"American ethos has always had a soft-spot for the conscientious objector. We're a nation of fervent individualists and everything from the writings of Mark Twain to the film 12 Angry Men (1957) codifies that idea. The power of an individual against a torrent of common corruption and blind group-think is almost fetishized, especially in contemporary society. The Japanese, generally speaking, don't have such a provocative streak of individualism embedded in their culture. So it's interesting that one of the most eloquent and austerely beautiful films on the subject should come from the land of the rising sun. Harakiri is a repudiation of the collective values of Japan that, on its best days unites a population in tragedy and at its worst marches a people towards war.Hanshiro Tsugumo (Nakadai) is an aging and embittered samurai whose feudal lord has died in battle along with most of his men. In order to reclaim his honor, according to the bushido code, Tsugumo must disembowel himself in a ritual suicide known as seppuku. To do this he arrives at the feet of Saito Kageyu (Mikuni) and asks members of the Iyi daimyo to help him do the ceremony correctly. Kageyu is hesitant as only a few days ago a similar request was made by another ronin who had no intention of committing seppuku but was looking to extort the clan for money. After Kageyu retells the man's tale, which culminates in the ronin dying by the blade of a bamboo sword, Tsugumo insists his intentions are to die with honor. Yet as the pavilion where the deed is to be done is setup, questions remain. What is Tsugumo's connection to the earlier ronin? Why did he pick the courtyard of the Iyi clan out of all others? Finally does he really intent to reclaim his honor, or is there something else going on?Told in a dizzying array of flashbacks and flash-forwards, Harakiri is not a leisurely movie to watch while folding laundry. It demands the attention of the viewer and weaves a complex tale of Hanshiro Tsugumo's home life after the fall of his clan. He's stricken with the most dire poverty, contemplating his daughter's (Iwashita) sale as a concubine and working menial jobs just to get by. His daughter, son-in-law Motome (Ishihama) and infant grandson Kingo are his only solace from a life of dishonor. Their fates become intimately intertwined with Tsugumo and the Iyi clan in unexpected ways and paying close attention to the plot pays off stunningly in the end.In his own quiet and ultimately unsettling way director Masaki Kobayashi strips away the nobility and romanticism commonly associated with feudal Japan. While doing so he implicates the modern audience (at the time the Japanese public circa 1962) in tolerating authoritarianism under the guise of honor. Harakiri recalls and parallels the days of Japanese imperialism and uses a single individual as a means to take apart the misplaced hubris of anyone still beholden to the old guard. Kobayashi himself was drafted in the army during WWII but repeatedly refused promotion beyond that of a private; his own way of fighting corruption, hypocrisy and evil.The film comes to a conclusion so damning and memorable that I dare not ruin the satisfaction of watching it for the first time. Harakiri is an absolute treasure featuring a star turn by Nakadai who first made an indelible mark on Japanese screens in Kobayashi's The Human Condition Trilogy (1959-1961). Here, while playing a character much older than himself, he still has a certain inner- turmoil that channels James Dean with a strong baritone. Finally there's Kobayashi's masterful direction which watches pensively and almost perversely as the jigsaw pieces fall in place.",Hara-Kiri
24,Sergeant_Tibbs,"Easily the best samurai film, perhaps the best Japanese film.",9,22 September 2014,"I usually don't like samurai movies. Even Kurosawa doesn't do it for me. I just can't sink into their ways of life and the world of 17th century Japan. However, Masaki Kobayashi's Harakiri totally subverts and questions everything they stand for in a compelling way. It's a study of the human condition in samurai form, naturally from the director of the epic saga The Human Condition, of which I need to finish after being impressed by the first part. It's a dissection of the metaphysical ideas of honour that bind the traditions of these men. While they try to commit to formalities, in the face of conflict they find it impossible. The story unravels like a psychological thriller although it's largely formed of flashbacks and talking but the connections that are drawn and the way the film blossoms to its explosive final 15 minutes is extraordinary. A suicide narrative like this is difficult, what are the stakes and what are the motives? Harakiri keeps you guessing, thanks to the incredible performances and when you feel like you've got it figured out, the whole picture changes. With its stark widescreen cinematography and disconcerting score, its technical aspects bolster the experience. It's a film that works on all levels, Harakiri is certainly the best Japanese film I've seen so far.9/10",Hara-Kiri
25,frankde-jong,Humanism against the Samurai code of honor,10,12 June 2020,"The generation that came after the renown Japanese directors Kurosawa, Ozu and Mizoguchi is generally regarded as less talented. The main representatives of this generation are Kaneto Shindo, Kon Ichikawa en Masaki Kobayshi. Personally I would like to make an exception for Masaki Kobayashi, who is in my opinion the equal of Kurosawa, Ozu and Muzoguchi.Kobayashi is best known in the West for his ghost stories ""Kwaidan"" (1964). The rest of his repertoire, among which the samurai movie ""Harakiri"" (1962), is not to be sneezed at either.A samurai movie is usually seen as a sort of Western of the East. Main ingredients of the Western genre are action and the battle beween the law (good) and the villains (bad).In ""Harakiri"" (which literal translation is: hara = belly , kiri = cutting) in stead of the law there is the samurai code of honor (Bushido in Japanese). But this code of honor is not the good element of the film. Rather it is revealed as a force of ruthlessness and hypocrisy. In the film the Bushido is represented by the Li clan.In ""Harakiri"" there is also little action. Only towards the end there is something that can be seen as a ""shoot out"". But in this shoot out the evil is not overcome, but only revealed as shallow (the idol of the Li clan is shown to be an empty armor).Translated in Western movie genres ""Harakiri"" is therefore no Western. Maybe it can be categorised as a Court room drama. The heart of the film consists of main character Hanshiro Tsugumo (Tatsuya Nakadai) telling his sad story. This story is in essence a requisitor against the Bushido. The performance of Nakadai as a broken Tsugumo is brilliant. His requisitor is not only aimed at the Li clan, but also against his own past. Once Tsugumo also was a samurai.Kobayashi was a convinced humanist all his life. Apart from ""Harakiri"" he also made the 9,5 hours epos ""The human condition"" (1959-1961). This epos is situated in World War II. For Kobayashi kamikaze was just another form of Harakiri and thus just another utterance of the old Bushido.",Hara-Kiri
26,PimpinAinttEasy,Greatest revenge thriller of all time .....,9,6 February 2016,"Dear Masaki Kobayashi, I am not a big fan of Japanese cinema or the Samurai genre. I have watched a few Kurosawas and Ozus and that's it. But things might change with Hara-Kiri which must be one of the greatest revenge films of all time.Your film was was riveting. Objectively speaking, this is one of the best films I've watched in my life. But then I'm a really subjective movie watcher.I really enjoyed the quite beginning. With people walking whisperingly across corridors. I also enjoyed the formal, hierarchical and ritualistic nature of the interactions between various characters and the storytelling. There is something very precise about the way each shot is framed - the men sitting in straight lines ready to attack, the way various objects are placed and also the interiors of the house of Iyi.The first Hara-Kiri scene of Motome Chijiiwa was cruel and sickening. The film is a suspenseful revenge thriller with lots of drama and social commentary.I'm sure the final sword fight scene inspired the one in Old Boy. And this film must have in someway inspired The Hateful Eight - men taking each other on in a really closed space, narrating stories etc.I wasn't that impressed by Tatsuya Nakadai. His beard seemed a bit artificial. I was also a bit bored in the middle when Tsugumo narrates the story of his daughter and her child.But these are minor charges.Best Regards, Pimpin.(9/10)",Hara-Kiri
27,Cosmoeticadotcom,Great,10,7 June 2012,"The film that Harakiri shares the most cinematic DNA with is Kurosawa's The Bad Sleep Well. In a sense, that film is the modern retelling of this film, wherein a vengeance seeking hero plots to destroy his tormentors, only to have him end up dying, as well as having the real truth expunged. But, along with that film, Harakiri never errs by making its politics lead its art around. From the almost exact repetitions of the early actions of Chijiwa and Tsugumo in the Iyi house, to the repetition of the samurai armor to start and end the film, there is no doubt that politics is merely a weapon in the artistic arsenal; it is not its raison d'etre. But, the film also shares much artistry and narrative technique in common with Kurosawa's more placid Ikiru, which also has a large portion of its ending consist of characters relating flashbacks of what happened to the film's lead character. That this dialogue intensity occurs in a samurai film is unusual, but only at first blush, since Harakiri is, in reality, as much of a samurai film as Stanley Kubrick's Paths Of Glory can be called a 'war' film. And, like films like The Wild Bunch and Once Upoin A Time In The West, Harakiri ends with a symbolic foreshadow of the future of the nation it's set in. It is no happenstance that the rogue ronin Tsugumo is not felled by another's sword, but only by guns, for that was the way the Tokugawa Shogunate, the ultimate bad guy in this film, was to fall almost 240 years later.The Human Condition ultimately missed out on greatness because of its length and overarching ambition, which sometimes obfuscated points that should have rung clarion. Harakiri does not suffer that ill. It is a deft lightning strike at its target, and as such delivers a killer blow. It also shows that Japan's filmic legacy, in the 20th Century, was more than its Big Three directors, Kurosawa, Yasujiro Ozu, and Kenji Mizoguchi. Masaki Kobayashi seems to be every bit their equal, and, along with Kon Ichikawa, Hiroshi Teshigahara, Shohei Imammura, Nagisa Oshima, and Mikio Naruse, the middle part of the last century seems to have been, for Japanese film, one of the most Golden of Golden Ages any country has experienced in any art form. Bravo!",Hara-Kiri
28,sharky_55,Hara-Kiri,10,29 March 2016,"The first shot of Harakiri is an imposing suit of samurai armour, seated on a bench amongst cinematic coils of smoke in the air. I say seating, because despite its hollowness, it's posture is imposingly life-like, almost as if at the call of war it would come to life and march off to battle. This must be how the Ii clan see this glorious suit of armour; even in peacetime it is more than just a tool for means of driving back enemies, but a symbol for honour, strength, loyalty and absolute morality. Of course as they prosper, the peacetime has released many ronin, now master-less and without a trade or living, into the wild wandering. This is really a film for a repeat watch. On first impression, Motome's pleas seem a little self-fulfilling, because why would a samurai committed to seppuku want a two day respite if they have renounced everything and are ready to die? His actual act of seppuku too, is extremely hard to watch - Kobayashi doesn't need to show actually graphic penetration because Ishihama's agony is so anguishing to witness. And yet, there is a hint of comeuppance, because it seems phony that a samurai would carry around a fake, bamboo version of his livelihood. On a second watch, these scenes are filled with such a tragic desperation once we know the back-story. The blunt, ironic cruelty of the bamboo strikes becomes heartbreaking because he has already sold his real blades for his family - what is a samurai without his blade? We know without a doubt he would return in two days this time. Doubly so, Hanshiro weeps because he has kept his own blade, foolishly holding onto a past relic much like the witnesses around him do so. Kobayashi has maintained such a steady, tense rhythm throughout the two hours and 13 minutes. Not once is there a line of misplaced dialogue, or a glance that was not filled with the appropriate amount of venom. We see one 'extortion' attempt, and then another from Hanshiro, so of course we await some sort of twist or connection. There is no sense of contrivance when he delays the act, no sense of artificial direction behind these characters. Tatsuya Nakadai is effortless. He has the knack for transforming so seamlessly into his character and becoming every ounce of them - here it is in his blank, almost traumatised expression as he narrates; it could not be more immediately obvious that this is a man who has lost everything. And then there is the little remaining spark underneath that drives this tale of revenge (his cackles as he bemusedly wonders on the fate of three men he has already taken care of), although it seems more vital to expose the Ii clan for the facade that they uphold. The framing device of the narration of the guest book is what seals it. It simultaneously empowers and suppresses the events of the film; even as we witness the despair of Saito, having his pretense so viciously and comprehensively demolished, he quickly rewrites the history books because he has that power (there's a cruel irony to the way he orders the forced seppuku of the three disgraced warriors - the noble ritual being marred). That stirring, dramatic duel in the windswept plains, gone. That desperate, climatic battle, where we might conventionally expect a one-man massacre and a little poetic justice, gone. And even as he attempts to go out on his own terms, Hanshiro is shot by a modernised death-dealer. It recalls Kurosawa's Yojimbo, in which it was actually Nakadai who wielded the gun and brought forth the end of the age of samurai. But here, it becomes a more potent, universally symbolic end. This cruel world does not bend to sentiment. Appearances must be upheld, even sometimes in the face of moral transgression. Hanshiro smashes the suit of armour, but it is gleaming and whole again soon. But it is of course a hollow ideal. All the honour in the world could not materialise a decent man to fill its shoes.",Hara-Kiri
29,elvircorhodzic,"""What befalls others today, may be your own fate tomorrow.""",9,3 June 2017,"HARAKIRI is an action drama about an unfortunate fate and an ironic revenge of a ronin.A ronin arrives at an estate of one clan and says that he wishes to commit seppuku (hara kiri) within the courtyard of their palace. To deter him, a senior counselor tells him the story about a young ronin who is looking for a way to commit seppuku, but set of circumstances has made his death a slow, painful and humiliating. Despite this warning a poor ronin insists that he has never heard that story and says that he has no intention of leaving their palace alive. After a suicide pavilion is set up in the courtyard of the palace, the ronin is asked to name the samurai who shall behead him when the ritual is complete. Coincidentally, he has chose three samurai who have participated in the ritual of the unfortunate young ronin from the counselor's story. However, all three decline to come, saying they are suffering from a life-threatening illness. The ronin has laughed ironically and started his shocking confession...This is a very dramatic and tragic story with a very strong final climax. That ritualistic form of suicide is further reinforce the impression of a dark atmosphere. The main villain is a certain kind of a corrupt lord. A desperate and poor hero slowly serves his revenge, with the intent to humiliate and embarrass his opponents. An ancient tradition, political conflicts and shattered pride follow his painful confession. Mr. Kobayashi has enriched a tense situation with a vivid and sad retrospectives. The final battle is truly magnificent, even an occasional shred of theatricality has its role. Characterization is pretty good. Tatsuya Nakadai (Tsugumo Hanshirō) has offered an excellent performance as a desperate and poor, but focused and brave ronin.The brutality and an attack in the agony give us an entirely new expression of the ancient samurai world.",Hara-Kiri

31,dr_foreman,"Action, emotion...and general brilliance.",10,22 January 2008,"While some so-called classics leave me cold, ""Harakiri"" (as it's known in the USA) really fires my imagination. This is a rare movie - the kind that I just can't stop recommending to people.Much of the film's appeal is based on surprising narrative twists, so I'm reluctant to delve too deeply into the plot here. But the basic setup is as follows - Japan has entered a time of peace, and consequently many samurai are unemployed and suffering in extreme poverty. Some samurai develop a ploy of threatening to commit suicide, but only so they can get sympathetic handouts of food and money from rich families. The film explores what happens when that ploy backfires in a very serious way.Director Masaki Kobayashi paces the film very slowly - by comparison, many Kurosawa and even Ozu films are breezy, and of course contemporary American films move approximately 800x faster. However, I am never really bored while watching ""Harakiri""; the film slowly builds toward a (very rewarding) climax, while filling in the characters' compelling backstories. In short, this movie requires - but pays back - patience. Stick with it, and you'll be rewarded with interesting revelations and even some exciting (and surprisingly violent) fight scenes.Due to its unusual blend of action, emotion and social commentary, ""Harakiri"" has shot right up my list of favorite films. I'm tempted to describe it as a Tarantino-style film, only with more of a conscience and a sophisticated worldview. But I suppose that any such comparisons between ""Harakiri"" and American movies must be broad and a little crude. Kobayashi's film stands on its own, of course, and is well worth seeking out for any cinema fan.",Hara-Kiri

33,net_orders,A Riveting Drama With Over-The-Top Acting!,9,16 July 2016,"Viewed on DVD. Restoration = ten (10) stars. This is a melodramatic tale set in Japan's early 1600's. It was a time of major societal disruption when unemployed samurai (known as ""ronin"") became a major problem with the ""peaceful"" unification of Japan under one emperor. Ronin lacked few (if any) skills transferable to civilian life. Their rigid adherence to the ""samurai code of honor"" did not help matters. They become dependent on handouts (sometimes coerced and gained by trickery). The director spins a story to illustrate how a military honor code ingrained over hundreds of years can rapidly become dysfunctional and of little practical use when the zeitgeist changes. The point being that outside of military life and its sponsors, the samurai code is really a ""facade."" Direction is seamless and creative: most of the film uses a single set, but the viewer scarcely notices this and is rarely bored (the movie, however, is a bit too long). Acting by Tatsuya Nakadai is a wonder to behold, and arguably the best brought to the ""classical"" Japanese cinema. The score is stark (mostly consisting of what sounds like a single got-tan), but effective. Cinematography (black and white, wide screen) is excellent with scene lighting adding much to driving the film's theme home to the viewer. Set decoration is appropriately sparse with many interiors either shot on location or carefully recreated in a studio setting. Subtitles leave a lot to be desired. They are usually too long with the title writer taking great liberties when translating line readings. Once again Criterion restoration engineers seem to take delight in harassing the viewer when s/he tries to turn on/off subtitles (you never know what to expect until restarting the film).

An in-depth analysis of the state and essence of the warrior class brings more sadness and a sigh. If the relationship between Bushido itself is set aside, Dazhe reflected in this film is also thought-provoking. Regardless of the political domination and administrative significance, some of the so-called ""morality"" used to restrain people may be manifestations of a contradictory complex . While asking others to obey this way, when ""moral"" conflicts with real life and human nature, can you know how to choose? May not be immersive and never reach a conclusion.

35,OttoVonB,Does to the Samurai genre what Wild Bunch did to the Western!,10,7 October 2005,"Having seen this film the mind becomes clouded with the innumerable things to say about it. Only praise comes to mind. Kobayashi has crafted The great samurai film for the rebel generation and he mixes a deftly handled criticism of authoritarian hypocrisy with a very touching piece of human drama.The plot is deceptively simple: an old samurai (touchingly portrayed by Tatsuya Nakadai of ""Ran"", ""Kagemusha"" and ""Sword of Doom"") arrives at a clan castle to commit seppuku in their yard, and then tells his tale, seemingly trying to gain time at first. What seems to be the rambling of an old man soon turns out to be a grieving account of how this man (and, more significantly, his loved ones) was wronged by the clan. Then comes the violent revenge (this is where you think ""Wild Bunch with katanas"", though they do up the ante toward the end with guns...).Kobayashi's direction is masterful, keeping an unbearable suspense during the mostly talky film, handling the touching scenes with care and maturity and giving us a sweeping fight to top all that. The 133 minutes running time never feels half that long! At the heart of it all though, is Nakadai, who, despite an excellent CV, delivers his greatest performance ever. His Tsugumo evokes a wounded panther, grieving an grieving until it gives in to fury. Nakadai's performance alone marks the film as essential viewing.If you're open to samurai flicks, this will rank among the finest films you've ever seen.",Hara-Kiri

It gave us a very dark and human insight of the life of a warrior. It also talks about how the leader of 'klans' play so dirty to sustain a blind illusion of order and prosperity.

38,ragingbull_2005,One of the greatest of all time. Rightly so.,8,10 May 2020,"Technically brilliant, narrative wise unpredictable, superbly acted, Harakiri (Japanese) is rightly considered as one of the best films of all time, across all languages.The setup is so tantalizing. A samurai turns up at a grand lord's home, searching for a place to commit suicide. The counselor at the grand lord's place tells him of another samurai who had come a month back with the same request and that sets the ball rolling.If this movie were in Technicolor and I were to not tell you the year in which it was released, it would be difficult for general audience to guess the year/decade of its release as there is not much, if anything, that seems dated.The one drawback for me was one of the sword fighting scenes that lacks the intensity of modern action sequences.

Made by one of Japan's finest directors, Harakiri is a near-masterpiece of film. It has a few flaws in my mind, such as a rather poor/unrealistic characterization and stiff acting, that somewhat reduces the overall quality of this work of art. Still, despite those problems, the overall experience remained very powerful and memorable. Indeed, this is one of those movies that I will never forget.One thing that I love about Japanese movies is the fact that they are slow paced and allow the film to really breathe though.

Kobayashi was certainly one of the most engaged directors on this topic.His genius is to transpose modern japan in the chanbara style using poetry and well-tough metaphors as well as an extremely engaging a universal narrative. Each character is motivation/emotion/aspiration can be defined by a simple glance at the characters' eyes, at a certain point, I noticed that the subtitles weren't necessary (and I don't speak a word of Japanese). This demonstrates how powerful the directing and the acting of the cast, and especially Tatsuya Nakadai are in this movie. I'm not even talking about the role that lighting an color grading had in this movie because they merit their own analysis!Sincerely, while this movie is indeed not the most action-packed jidaigeki film out there.

His backstory is too melodramatic to take very seriously, but his father-in-law's plan to turn the tables on the sadistic lord is ingenious. ""Harakiri""'s reputation for being a critique of bushido (the way of the warrior) and the samurai film genre is probably overstated. The stylish slash-em-up at the end of the movie represents an attack on those who fail to live by the samurai code of ethics but expect others to do so.

This is a tale about their fate, masterfully told in a way similar to Kurosawa's 'Rashomon' and Zhang Yimou's 'Ying Xiong'. This probably is typical for Asian storytelling in legends and myths, but it is so powerful it deserves a mention. Like Ibsen is known for the meaning is unraveled through retrospectives told by the head of Iyi and the protagonist Hanshiro Tsugumo.Nakudai Tatsuya plays Hanshiro Tsugumo and no one could outdo his performance here, but maybe Mifune could equal him. It just recently watched another movie in which he also played the protagonist excellently, but I couldn't remember his face so clearly (in Teshigahara's 'Tanin no Kao'). Other actors don't get much light shone on them here.The social fate of the ronin was poverty and therefore death by seppuku as it was the only fate worthy of a samurai. The movie points at this and how the House of Iyi was empowered by the same code of honour, oppression of the poor and the concealing of anything not worthy, that which is not honourable. The social commentary on the ronin may or may not be including the rest of the oppressed population, in that the ronin were not being able to get a job like the peasants because they know the way of the sword suggests that it is not.

48,kurosawakira,Absolute Icons,10,15 January 2013,"My favourite Kobayashi, and among my favourite Japanese films of all time, ""Harakiri"" (known in Japan as ""Seppuku""; the former is a spoken term, the latter a written one for the same thing, the former likely adopted in the West on the basis of some general awareness of the word) is a masterly exploration of space, symmetry, honour, disloyalty, tradition, modernity and truth.This film has one of the most amazing opening sequences ever. It goes beyond the best of Greenaway or Tarkovsky in how the camera moves and reveals a space, and I'd like to know whether Zhang Yimou considers this an influence on the similarly masterly ""Raise the Red Lantern"" (Da hong deng long gao gao gua, 1991). Especially the framing in the exterior shots is just as beautifully conveyed. Anyway, back to the sequence – there we are introduced to the idea of the ""house"": not only in the sense of ""assembly"" but also as a building. The main visual motif of the film (the courtyard scenes are another) is very theatrically revealed in shadow and light, and even before the narrative begins (we enter a book read to us, which again, appropriately, is not the whole truth).I am so in love with how the film looks and how the camera moves. Symmetries open, are revealed, tighten. There are amazingly patient tracking shots, especially in the interiors, where the camera sometimes barely moves at all.The performances are just as amazing as the rest of the craft. In fact, this film brings together two absolute icons. For me, Tatsuya Nakadai is the quintessential Japanese actor, even greater than Mifune. His presence is overwhelming, just as his humanity. His eyes speak more than a thousand words in mere glances. Rentarô Mikuni is another, and his work in Ichikawa's ""The Burmese Harp"" (Biruma no tategoto, 1956) and in Imamura's films (most notably in ""The Profound Desires of the Gods"" [1968] and ""Vengeance is Mine"" [1979]) adds tremendously to my viewing experience.

51,sandnair87,"'Harakiri' is A Potent Genre Film, that Contains a Moving Story of Human Tragedy!",9,18 January 2016,"Samurai films, like westerns, need not be familiar genre stories. They can expand to contain stories of ethical challenges and human tragedy. 'Harakiri', a shining example of the kind, is about one samurai who takes his time to create an unanswerable dilemma for the elder of a powerful clan. By playing strictly within the rules of Bushido Code which governs the conduct of all samurai, he lures the powerful leader into a situation where sheer naked logic leaves him humiliated before his retainers.The story is set in a time when feudal Japan is at peace, and starving out-of-work samurai beg to perform ritual suicide or 'hara-kiri' at the mansions of powerful clans - a request they hope will lead to a charitable pittance or a menial job. One such lone ronin arrives at the temple of Lord Iyi and asks to use the courtyard to perform honorable ritual self-disembowelment, hara-kiri or seppuku. That seems like the beginning and the end of this movie, all in one: a checkmate. But director Masaki Kobayashi instead constructs a masterful chess game, filled with many carefully constructed moves, each arranged to fit in a particular place - it's glorious to behold!Thus, it would be foolish to give away too much. But the ronin Hanshiro Tsugumo (Tatsuya Nakadai) has chosen this particular temple for a very grievous personal reason. His hara-kiri is postponed when, kneeling on the white-sheeted death platform, he requests one after another, three separate house retainers serve as seconds to cut off his head. All three so indisposed as to be unable to attend, the ronin then begs a moment of time to tell his story. Like a brilliant player, he leaves out crucial details until the most opportune moments.The movie openly depicts vanity and corruption among the samurai class, showing that the Lord is more concerned with his reputation than with actual samurai honor. The film has a steady, hypnotic momentum; Kobayashi, wrings as much drama out of facial twitches as he does out of sword fights which are all elegantly composed and photographed to reflect the values it contains. He's helped immensely by Nakadai's molten central performance and the spare, disquieting music. Using superb architectural compositions, Mr. Kobayashi achieves a sort of visual mesmerization that is suitable to the curious nightmare mood.In the end, ""Harakiri"" goes well beyond the usual genre trappings to beautifully underline its recurring theme - that fanatic adherence to codes of honor, by granting them a value greater than life itself, sets up a situation where humanitarian values are forbidden.",Hara-Kiri
52,jay4stein79-1,Astounding,10,1 April 2006,"Kobayashi is one of the unsung heroes of Japanese cinema. Ozu and Kurosawa get all the ink, and they do so undeservedly to my mind. Kobayashi, Shinoda, and Mizoguchi do get respect, but their skill and artistry should elevate them above Kurosawa if not Ozu as well. Harakiri is, probably, my favorite samurai film, which, I think, derives from its willingness to talk and explore the concept of the samurai and the code of honor by which they abide. Harakiri seems, to me, to work on a number of levels, while most of Kurosawa's films operate on the most basic one. Rashomon digs deeper, but the rest seem content to exist as fun little action movies with great vistas. Harakiri is different. The setting also helps. The compound in which the action takes place is one of the most amazing sets I've encountered in any film. It seems magical to me, and the cinematography of the interiors is astounding. Like most people, I'm usually more struck by gorgeous photography of open land; interiors are harder to film in interesting ways. Harakiri manages to make the inside of the compound spare and, occasionally, unreal. It's magnificent. Overall, I think this film is immensely enjoyable and will appeal to anyone with an appreciation of Japanese cinema--especially those that would typically avoid a samurai movie.",Hara-Kiri

The film is a masterclass in portraying the human condition while showcasing some of the best cinematography and direction I've ever seen in a film. Literally every frame (with its perfect lighting, blocking and composition) is like a painting come to life, just perfect. Masaki Kobayashi paces this film perfectly and keeps you engrossed with one of the most beautiful and incisive pieces of human drama I've ever seen.

2) The cultural and era often make no sense (in contemporary American terms)
3) They take the traditions and bushido code far too seriously
4) They're absurdly brutish masculine, almost like animalsThis film takes a different approach in that 90% of the film is story-telling, and the sword play is almost ancillary. It's a nice change, but ultimately boring.STORY: If you've watched Japanese (samurai) film then the story is old. It's as simple as vengeance sought for some injustice, which isn't a bad thing. But after awhile, this becomes boring, if not useless. There is ZERO CHARACTER development here, which seems inconsistent with the (seeming) intent of the director. But I felt almost nothing for the characters, or their travail.ACTING: Again, as to Japanese samurai film, it's fine. But there's NO acting that stands up, let alone out. Just dull, flat, mechanical. Aside from the perfunctory grunting, the dialogue is predictable.TEMPO: Very, very, very slow. Not atypical for the sub-genre, but brutally slow.CINEMATOGRAPHY: The scenery is lack-luster, but at least tidy. Props are OK, but sparse. Sound is OK, but nothing interesting.DIRECTING: This same director churns this stuff out on script and cue.

63,Koundinya,Enervated samurais living in penury perform the sacred act of Evisceration:- Hara-kiri,10,23 June 2012,"While Japanese movies are synonymous to Akira Kurosawa and Toshiro Mifune, this movie has neither of them. It's an unprecedented movie that leaves you brood over the plight of the once-great-warriors of the medieval Japan. The movie is aided by brilliant handling of the camera and loud yet powerful background music. The duel between Tsugumo and Omodaka set in the backdrop of plains with bushes ruffling against the gale was the most impressive scenes in the movie.Samurais, warriors known for their fighting skills and adept wielders of sword, are unemployed and are forced to live in penury after their clans make truce. They even struggle to get a job with workers demanding samurais not be employed. They resort to threatening other clans by saying they'd perform ancient religious practice of Hara-kiri, which is to disembowel oneself, if they are not awarded with a bounty.One such samurai Tsugumo offers his life to the Lyi clan. He's enlightened with the story of a man who gave exactly the same details as Tsugumo. They narrate the story of a certain Motome, who was so poverty-stricken that he had a bamboo instead of a blade and performs the practice in the most atrocious fashion. Motome's sacrifice served as an example to all those samurais who seek fortune in the name of intimidation to end one's life. Tsugumo confesses he was willing to perform hara-kiri whole-heartedly bu wishes his head be slashed by a great warrior of the clan. The warrior is ill and Tsugumo suggests two more names and all the three men have taken ill. The head of the clan senses Tsugumo's plot to procrastinate. Tsugumo wishes to narrate his story before it's time to enter the other world.He concedes that he and Motome were acquainted. Motome was his son-in-law, who taught in the neighborhood to earn a living. Stricken by poverty and an ailing wife and neonate son in the house, he fails to find a job and even sells his priced sword to earn a little money. He then heads to the Lyi clan to implore for the money but he's forced into performing Hara-kiri. Without medication and care, Tsugumo's daughter and grandson pass on. Tsugumo enlightens the men of the clan what actually happened to the men who responsible for his son-in-law's death in a way. An exasperated head orders Tsugumo be severed by the swords and pierced by spears. Tsugumo resists for a while, takes the life of 4 and lacerates 8 others before he dies.The head of the clan orders the 3 absentees be killed by skilled men and cover up all the killings in the name of illness thereby receiving appreciation from the administration.A 10/10 movie.",Hara-Kiri

65,Mnemosyne15,The loneliness of Bushido,8,17 March 2020,"There is a law in human society. No matter what, if it exists for a long time, it will slowly deteriorate, decay, and rigid. As soon as the heyday of the Taiping arrived, there was no need to fight anymore, and Bushido gradually became empty furnishings and forms. Young warriors have hardly ever seen war, and warriors have only become a symbol of identity and status. Like the armor of the ancestor worshipped on the altar, it will not be used for a long time, and it has lost its original meaning and has become a meaningless worship. Bushido, like feudal autocracy, is rigid, degenerate, and decaying. The big name is to maintain the dignity of Bushido, in fact, to maintain the identity and pomp of his nobility.
The film illustrates the decline and deterioration of this Bushido from three different directions.
To the beggar, he was a young warrior, and he also lacked a deep understanding of these tedious warrior temperaments and spirits. However, he is also a simple man, a law-abiding person. However, in the face of the burden of the family, he had to let go of this spiritual pursuit, facing the cruel reality, and sold his sabre with pain. A man who has abandoned all dignity for his wife and children is miserable and bears humiliation. For him, Bushido is just a spiritual obsession, a distant cold spiritual pursuit. He couldn't reach it, so, like a deadly law, he was finally abandoned in the presence of a warm and tangible family. However, the most tragic thing is that this man who was deprived of his dignity and spirit was ultimately killed in his injustice.",Hara-Kiri

There are too many movies dealing with family dramas, not only movies but also TV shows and even in CF. I don't want to see any more family dramas. And one more, this screenwriter always draws such a script. In other words, it is a technique that advances the story by interweaving the present and the past. Looking at this movie alone is a great composition, but I's spoiled to see many other works written by this screenwriter.

It goes from boring to very depressing. The council show no remorse for their actions. It is good how he goes out to shame his son in laws wrong doers rather than kill them.

73,jonsefcik,So Close To Perfection,9,17 February 2019,"Seven Samurai is pretty great, but I think Harakiri is even better. This tale of a ronin seeking revenge and exposing the flawed samurai code is so close to perfection. The story is engrossing and despite the slow pacing it's never boring. What the production lacks in scale it makes up for with emotional intensity. The sparse, ominous score is perfect for this film. The direction and cinematography are masterful and the camera's slow pans and zooms really butter my croissant. The editing is great and purposeful too. There's not a single weak performance but Tatsuya Nakadai in the leading role steals the show.My only complaints are with some of the pacing and fight choreography. There's a standoff scene in the middle that could have been cut (since it felt like a cheap way to build tension and it wouldn't make sense for them to continue waiting afterward) and the long flashback could have also been trimmed. The film is 2 hours 13 minutes but I think exactly 2 hours would have been perfect. From a fight choreography standpoint the one-on-one fight scenes were well done but climax was shaky. There were many interesting ideas and moments in there, but also several points where I was like ""okay, how did they not strike him there?""Harakiri is an outstanding film that deserves more attention. If you haven't seen this film check it out. The Criterion restoration is absolutely beautiful. I intentionally kept this review vague since it's best to go into it knowing as little as possible.

75,judemcrobbie,Didn't love it.,7,11 February 2021,"Let's be honest, if you're watching this it's because you either want to watch a samurai, foreign language or highly rated movie. I'd have to recommend you watch Seven Samurai (1954) by Akira Kurosawa first.
Harakiri, to me, just lacked the immersion factor to keep me hooked. I believe this is for a multitude of reasons:
Firstly, there are two stories of sorts. One of which is the Samurai telling his story before committing Harakiri. The second is how he got to that point. These two stories separately would work however they do not share the same amount of action throughout. This is the thought about rising action through movies and how that should be applied to keep the audience invested. Harakiri does not do that and therefore lacks the urgency needed.
Secondly, the second act was much weaker than the first and last as there was basically no action, which felt necessary as they foreshadowed and alluded to it but it never came, leaving a sense of an unanswered question.
Thirdly and lastly, the amount and use of exposition. Sometimes exposition can be done eloquently, but in this it is clunky and does not fit in. For example, a samurai (about to commit Harakiri) is asking about it.
There are a lot of things good with this movie however. Namely the score and cinematography. This is one of the best shot movies I've seen. Obviously it's in a grainy, black-and-white and I don't even think you can see it in in HD. But those shots and camera movements is jaw-dropping at times. And the score is, for lack of a better word, weird. Its much less music and a combinations of sounds. This truly makes for an incredible sound experience, as the combination of drums, silence and shrill notes creates incredible tension alone. This score is so good that you could sense the emotion without hearing dialogue, nor seeing visuals.
The act of Harakiri itself is definitely a not-so-subtle metaphor for masculinity, pride and mental health; predominately in men. Especially how they would rather 'bite the bullet' or, in this instance, take a painful sword to the abdomen than have to confront taking. This is doubly so as through the movie as he has responsibilities of a men, to his children and his faction.
I like it, especially the concept, but it's just a bit slow and ungripping for me.",Hara-Kiri
76,svikasha,The Pinnacle of Cinematographic Buildup in Black and White Japanese Cinema,10,24 June 2017,"The concept of ritual suicide in the form of Harakiri, otherwise known as Seppuku, has captivated western imaginations for centuries. Indeed, the very notion of suicide, for religious or social reasons is viewed with a feeling of disdain within the western mindset. However, ritual suicide held an important ceremonial role for members of the Samurai class in ancient Japan. Viewed as an important component of the Samurai's Bushido warrior code, Harakiri was often used as a punishment but was often done voluntarily as well. It was a matter of honor and upheld the tradition of the warrior code. Harakiri forces the audience to confront the brutality of such a tradition and questions the morality of it. During the film, the main character questions both Bushido and the authenticity of the warrior code. He asserts that Bushido is a mere facade rather than a symbol of discipline. Whether or not these assertions are true, is a question that Harakiri leaves for the audience to decide.During the Edo period of the Tokugawa shogunate in Japan, it was common for master less samurai who were known as Ronin to request to commit harakiri in the palace of feudal lords.In this tradition, a man who goes by the name of Tsugumo Hanshirō requests to commit suicide at a powerful feudal lord's courtyard. Masaki Kobayashi directed this film to start out slow with the old man Hanshirō narrating a story. The story is about how the powerful clan at the courtyard was responsible for the death of Hanshirō's entire family. The old man confronts the powerful feudal clan in such a calm and authoritative manner that the audience is left at the edge of their seats. Hanshirō's daughter was married to a poor Samurai that was so destitute that he had to sell his blade to care for his family. He has a young baby who unfortunately gets sick and becomes desperately in need of medicine. When Hanshirō's son in law came to the Li clan seeking alms for medicine, they chose to punish him for disgracefully giving up his Samurai sword by forcing him to disembowel himself in the Seppuku fashion using the only sword he had left: a dull bamboo katana. After covering the dramatic backstory, the movie masterfully builds up to the final conclusion where Hanshirō uses every last ounce of his Samurai abilities to fight his way into the feudal lord's compound to desecrate his hall. The sheer force of will and determination displayed by Hanshirō's character on-screen is a testament to the acting abilities of Tatsuya Nakadai.Despite being shot in black and white, the film is aesthetically appealing as it depicts idyllic Japanese villages and sword fights in Samurai graveyards. At the climax of the film, the greatest line of the film is spoken. Before the culminating final sword battle, the main character proudly proclaims, ""Motome had indeed gone mad. But I say good for him! I praise him for it. He may have been a samurai, but he was a man of flesh and blood. He could not live on air alone. When he has reached the point of no return, even a man as strong as Motome will go mad trying to protect his family, and I would praise him for it. They'll call him the bamboo ronin. Not only samurai, but townspeople, too, will scoff at his wavering. But let them laugh all they want. Who can fathom the depths of another man's heart?"".",Hara-Kiri
77,auberus,"Eventually there is only one valid code of Honor, the Human one...",8,19 May 2008,"Masaki Kobayashi studied art and philosophy before starting as assistant director at Shochiku studio. His oeuvre is guided by the need to understand the human condition. In the 1962 Hara-kiri aka Seppuku, we can clearly see the philosophic influence in this story about confrontation between Human condition and Rigid Code of a feudal society. The result of this confrontation is a multi layered masterpiece in which the clarity of the script, the perfection of the interpretation, and a very well balanced ""mise en scène"" make for a powerful film based on transgression: a genre transgression, a code transgression and an image transgression. Most of Shambaras take place during the Edo Period but rather late in that period (just before the Meiji Era) as most filmmakers try to romanticize and glamorize the period which marks the end of the Samurai thus playing the nostalgia card. Here Masaki Kobayashi transgressed the genre and decided to film a story taking place in 1630, 17th century Japan during the Edo period. At that time Japan was ruled by a Shogunate (Ieyasu Tokugawa). The Tokugawa Shoguns established Peace and continued to rule Japan for a remarkable 250 years. But such a long period of Peace had a price and Ieyasu Tokugawa brought the whole country under tight control. He cleverly redistributed the land among the more loyal vassals, breaking up warrior clans thus throwing thousands of samurai into poverty. In the film an elder ronin, Hanshiro Tsugumo, the hypnotic Tatsuya Nakadai (Goyokin) seeks admittance to the house of a feudal lord to commit the act of Seppuku as he can no longer stand his Life of Dishonor and Poverty. There, the administrator tells him about the fate of a young Samurai who committed the same suicidal ritual few times ago. But there is much more to this story and soon we understand that all protagonists are related one way or another. As the film progresses we witness a confrontation between two conceptions. One is based on a Human code; the other is based on a rigid traditional one. Masaki Kobayashi uses both symbols and raw images to show this confrontation. The film starts with the Display of a Samurai shining battle armor representing the feudal system. The armor is empty of anything human and strongly symbolized the feudal system. Can a code make sense if it is followed without acknowledging the Human condition? This is in essence the question raised by ""Hara-kiri"". We see this armor soiled and dragged but at the end of the film the armor remains intact as if nothing had ever happened, as if changes in an given Society take some times to occur. Indeed social Progress has always been slow leaving Men and Women struggling with their condition. The suicidal ritual, Hara-kiri reinforced the sense of cruelty. Raw images of Ronin opening their stomach with a sword were a transgression at that time (1962), still is today. In the film the ritual is portrayed in a non glamorized way and very realistically. It also symbolizes even for the Japanese audience the lack of sense in the act of Seppuku. In fact Hanshiro Tsugumo is the only one giving meaning to this act by motivating it with mixed feelings of Love, Revenge and Sorrow, in short with humanity. With the film Hara-kiri, Masaki Kobayashi signed one of the greatest philosophical films. The script by Shinobu Hashimoto is a good example on how to make a story clear but more importantly sufficient enough for anybody to understand the drama, in one word universal. Also writer of Jôi-uchi: Hairyô tsuma shimatsu aka Samurai Rebellion (1967), Dai-bosatsu tôge (1966) aka Sword of Doom or ""Hitokiri"" aka Tenchu (1969), Shinobu Hashimoto is among the greatest writers of the 7th Art. I can not recommend Seppuku enough, every single frame, acting, piece of music is irreproachable. The story is profoundly Humanist, timeless and universal. I suggest we all confront the codes of our respective societies in order to find out if they still make sense or if they are leading us towards a terrible social Hara-kiri",Hara-Kiri

My expectations were pretty low, I knew nothing about it prior to watching it, and I had no idea where movie was going for first 30 minutes or so.There are few things I did not like, such as characters being slightly underdeveloped, and really none were likable. By the end of the movie I felt that main character accomplished nothing as the ""bad guys"" simply covered up their lack of honour and went on to prosper. So why would I give it a 10? Well, its simple. I believe in either suggesting one watch a movie, and give it a 10, or suggesting movie is a waste of time and giving it a 1. This movie, despite its shortcomings, is extremely well put together. Story felt very real, as in ""it could have happened"". Movie prompts one to question what they would do if they were in place of one of characters, and it felt particularly close to me as it points out the issue of what happens to soldiers when there is no war for them to fight in. Those that have fought in wars and came home just to need to readjust might get what I mean, otherwise be glad you don't know what its like.Considering it was made in 1962 and that it is about time period far earlier than that, and that I saw it in 2013 and loved it, this movie really stands the test of time.My advice would be to see this movie. If you start watching it, and it feels slow, or that it is going nowhere, exercise bit of patience, it gets better. End is very unpredictable, a real rarity for me, and while it left me wanting more clear vindication for one character, I believe character got it, in a meaningful way to himself, and that I felt it was not enough perhaps due to cultural differences.",Hara-Kiri

82,cauwboy,The only reason this isn't higher on the imdb 250 is because not enough people have seen it yet.,10,15 April 2020,"I've set myself this task to see all of the films on the top 250 list (which in the end will be an impossible task, because it changes every day.) And that's probably the only reason how I even found out that this film existed at all.This is why I love movies, when you think you've seen it all, old films like this one just hits you with surprises you weren't even aware of could be in films as early as this one. And for a film about a ritual suicide, I've not been so excited and burst out in laughter in a long time as I did with this one. But I'm not going to say more, because the less you know seeing this film, the better - even the current plot summary on the films page gives away too much, and I'm just happy I didn't read it as I started watching this film. All I can say is that with the fame Kurosawa and Mifune have with their samurai film, I just hope that Masaki Kobayashi and Tatsuya Nakadai will be more known to the world as time goes by, they belong up there with the masters.Currently at the 33th spot on the top 250 list when I'm writing this text, I can only see it go higher with time when more people discover this gem of a film.",Hara-Kiri

84,tintin-23,Honor and Hypocrisy,10,9 September 2006,"It would seem impossible that any ""samurai"" movie could surpass Kurosawa's ""Ran,"" ""Kagemusha,"" or even ""Rashomon"" in visual impact, masterful storytelling, and moral imperative. However, there is such a film, and it is ""Seppuku"" (""Harakiri""), produced in 1962, arguably the best samurai movie ever made.""Harakiri"" (1962), as it is known in the West, was directed by one of the post-WWII great filmmakers of Japan, Masaki Kobayashi. This film, considered by many as his masterpiece, won him the International Jury Prize at Cannes in 1965. Unfortunately, Kabayashi is not as well known outside Japan as some other giants of the Japanese cinema. He was very much affected by the war, and his films, contrary to most Japanese filmmakers of the post-war eras, are very political in nature. Kobayashi's films explore the dark side of the Japanese culture, with its wars, corruption, and hypocrisy, and their consequences. His film, ""The Thick-Walled Room"" (1953), won him the 1956 Peace Culture Prize. His nine-hour trilogy, ""The Human Condition"" (1959/61), won the International Jury Prize at Cannes 1963, which actually launched his public recognition, presents a scathing critique of the horrors of WWII, experienced first-hand while on the Manchurian front, and later on the Ryukyu Islands. While serving, as a statement of dissent against war, he refused any promotion and remained a private until he was taken prisoner by the U.S. He spent one year in a prison camp before returning to the business of film making, in 1946, until 1952 as an assistant director under Keisuke Kinishita.In Japan, Seppuku is the formal term for ritual suicide by disembowelment. Harakiri, as it is known in the West, is the common term, which literally means ""stomach cutting."" It was an integral part of bushido, the code of conduct of the samurai warrior class. Seppuku was ordered by a superior as punishment to redeem some offence, or chosen over a dishonorable death at the hands of an enemy. In both cases, it demonstrated the honor, courage, loyalty, and high moral character of the individual. Except when performed on a battlefield, it was a very formal ceremony, requiring certain etiquette, witnesses and considerable preparation.Harakiri is a particularly painful and rather messy way of ending one's days. In this ritual, the ""performer"" opens his abdomen, starting from left to right and then finishing from top toward bottom. But there is so need to be left for hours contemplating one's entrails. Another swordsman acting as a ""second,"" called kaishakunin, is standing by to decapitate the departing at a pre-arranged moment in the ceremony. Lord Ieyasu Tokugawa, who founded Japan's last great shogunate dynasty in 1603, ordered the practice of harakiri to be discontinued by both secondary and primary retainers. Later on, in 1663, a stronger edict from Lord Nobutsuna Matsudaira of Izu, put an end to the practice altogether. By that time, the ritual had become an idle formalism, and the ""performer"" was decapitated at the instant he took his sword out of the scabbard, thus avoiding a painful death. In some instances, the sword was replaced by a fan.Hanshiro Tsugomo (Tatsuya Nakadai) comes to the castle of the Iyi Clan to seek revenge for the humiliation and cruel death of his son-in-law, Anjiwa Motome (Akira Ishihama). Kobayashi is a superb storyteller, and in a slow and deliberate rhythm, he develops his story, which could have been taken from the pages of the Iliad or of the Mahabharata. The tension grows, as the Clan members slowly realize that they are in turn being humiliated by this stranger who truly believe in the samurai code of honor: he must be terminated to prevent him to broadcast his truth.The final duel with the master swordsmen of the Clan, Hikukuro Omodaka, on the Plains of Gojin-in, is like a meditation, a ballet of death. The film ends in a spectacular combat, and the coup de grace to Hanshiro Tsugomo's seppuku is fittingly not applied by a gallant swordsman, but a cowardly platoon of muskets. Even to the end, the samurai honor code has been violated by the Clan.As Toshiro Mifune has long been associated with the success of Kurosawa's films, so are Kogayashi's films enhanced by the brilliant interpretation of Tatsuya Nakadai (also staring in the leading roles in Kurosawa's ""Kagemusha"",and ""Ran""). This outstanding actor contributed further to the success of this director's films, ""Kwaidan"" and the ""Samurai Rebellion."" The screenplay by Shinobu Hashimoto is based on a novel by Yasuhiko Takiguchi The cinematography, by Yoshio Miyajima, in black and white, is gorgeous. Many on the shots are ""haiku-like"" in the imagery. The musical score, written for an ensemble of ancient instruments and percussion by the renowned classical composer Toru Takemitsu, is used sparingly throughout the film, reinforcing the dramatic moments.Masaki Kobayashi's film is an indictment of the hypocrisy of the establishment, any establishment, would it be in feudal 17th Century Japan or in any other time. Dogma, on which the establishment's authority rests, is evil. The established, codified order, with all its smoke and mirrors, must be preserved at all costs, and nothing must be allowed to come in its way. It is the duty of each member of any government, organization, church, or brotherhood not to spare any effort and to go to any length to protect the appearances and status quo, to achieve this essential goal of survival. The end justifies the means, and no lie or deceit can be eliminated if this survival is at stake.Although taking place almost five centuries ago during the Tokugawa Shogunate, this film is also a strong denunciation of the entrenched cultural legacy of coercive rituals, blind obedience, and chauvinism that resulted in the tragedy of the Pacific War.The outstanding screenplay, the superb acting, the cinematography and editing makes ""Harakiri"" the best samurai film ever.",Hara-Kiri

86,grendel-37,One of the most intriguing and effective soundscapes since the great Dimitri Tiomkin's work on 1950s DOA,9,10 January 2005,"Just saw this film thanks in part to comments left on this site, avoiding the spoilers of course. Just wanted to give my take on the film, and some of the reviews on the film.First if you haven't seen the film, simply put it's not just worth seeing, it's worth buying. It is a well performed, brilliantly photographed, hauntingly scored, and masterfully directed film.That said it's often spoken of in the same breath as SWORD OF DOOM, and that is highly misleading. If you go in expecting the visceral, brilliantly choreographed sword fights and unrelenting action of that film, you will not find it here.This is very much a drama, a morality tale of a time and a place; an exploration and an indictment of a way of life, and as such it has very few equals. The movie does lag, it is in many ways a monologue, one man talking more to himself than anyone else, of the ending of his life.But an enthralling story, captivating visuals, and above all else, one of the most intriguing and effective soundscapes since the great Dimitri Tiomkin's work on 1950s DOA, keeps this static film... moving and engrossing.Mentioning DOA, leads me to the bashing Hollywood takes regularly here from ""critics"" such as Landor28. Critics who in their rush to praise films, do it by backhanding other films. I'm not a critic, I'm just a reviewer. Critic implies you have some from the mountaintop perspective that gives you the right to criticize. Unless you've made movies, superior to what you're reviewing, you don't get to criticize. Review yes, criticize... no.Has Hollywood made bad films? Yes Hollywood makes its share of bad films, so does Japan, so does India, so does Hong Kong, so does every other country that makes movies. However Hollywood makes the most films, the most visible films, and the largest films, so it is an easy lump-sum target as opposed to taking each film on its own merits. Hollywood in fact is judged harsher by these critics, held to a higher standard than films from elsewhere in the world.I am no defender of Hollywood, as I don't work there, and not fortunate to know anyone who does, but I am a film fan, and a fan of the truth, and to praise films by Kurosawa and Kobayashi and to denigrate the films of Hollywood is to make a mistake these directors did not. These men, like all postwar filmmakers, were inspired by the films of Hollywood, particularly present in the work of all these directors is the large and brilliant work of John Ford.Kurosawa would be the first to state this. Fords widescreen westerns are at the heart of the cinematic recreation of the Samurai. The samurai world as envisioned by Kurosawa as much about history as it is the heroic imagery of the western. They are Stagecoach and Searchers transplanted to the east.A simplification to be sure, but not much of one. Postwar cinema in Japan and throughout the world copied from the states, and that's a good thing. And has started a trend that continues to this day of films successful in one country being copied in another. And we are the better for this two way copying. That's what film is people, copying.Copying a headline, or a book, or a play, or another film, copying a moment and making it your own. That's what all art is, looking at something, copying something, a sunset, a tree, a woman, a birds cry, and adding your own... bleeding to it. That's all life is, being influenced by something people have bled on, and if we are great men, leaving our own blood on it... to influence others.Only those with no art in their souls, don't see this. Only the very young, or the very stupid. Landor28 accuses Scorscese of stealing from Seppuku, an inane comment to make.How many shots in Seppuku but reecho earlier brilliant compositions of Stroheim. But I don't hear you calling Kobayashi a thief. And rightly so, no one owns a shot. Cinema, and images belongs to the story that can tell it. And if that image or look, can service well a thousand films, than it should be used a thousand times. What is film noir, but the same type of look, and camera angles used repeatedly. But used from the directors own viewpoint, it becomes the director's tale. So the comment of theft shows someone ignorant of the fact that there is nothing new under the sun, there are just 7 stories and 5 angles; and all cinema since.... but each person retelling this story through the lens of their own joy or pain.And if they are honest, the story each time... is worth hearing.Give these directors, whether they work in India, or New Zealand or Kenya or Hollywood their due. Shymalan is a great director, Weir is a great director, Fincher is a great director, Carl Frankin is a great director, Lee is a great director, Zimmerman is a great director, Gibson (for Braveheart not Passion), Ron Howard is a great director, Edward Zwick is a great Director (his resume since 89 reads like a bloody history lesson of great films.) and they all work in Hollywood, and their work inspires all kinds of foreign flicks you do rave about.Get off of Hollywood's back, it's always popular to hate the top dog, but it's also sometimes unwarranted.SEPPUKU is a great film, by a master director. ***1/2 out of ****. If you like it also check out these films: GLORY (1989 Ed Zwick), COURAGE UNDER FIRE, A HERO NEVER DIES, KING OF NEW YORK, LE SAMOURAI, SWORD OF DOOM, BACKDRAFT, Excalibur, TUAREG, MENACE II SOCIETY.They are all films about, to one degree or another, displaced honor and cannibal societies.",Hara-Kiri
87,Kajin_,Redundant Review,10,23 March 2020,"This may be a generalization based on what I have seen of Japanese cinema so far, but classical Japanese films seem to have a purpose beyond mere entertainment. There always seems to be an underlying message or life lesson to tell. At least, the films I have seen so far (among others Ikiru, Seven Samurai, and the Human Condition Trilogy) give room for such interpretation.HARAKIRI is no different. While many interpretations of the director's intentions gear towards a criticization (or condemnation) of Japan's feudal past and early 20th century militarism, I drew an additional conclusion. I will keep that conclusion to myself, for I don't intend or want to direct anyone towards anything.The only reason I have written this ""review"", for this film does not need more praise, is to have something to reflect upon after the next many times that I will undoubtedly watch HARAKIRI.",Hara-Kiri

But as I 've noticed, other brothers in IMDb have already done that so its OK I guess. Like ""Brasil"", this movie I've seen only once in my life and many years ago, but for some reason, I still remember it (as well as the feelings that it gave me) very vividly. It is against my principals to call anything ""the best"", no matter what it is. After all, opinions are like butts. Everybody 's got his own. But ""Seppuku"" IS one of those films -I can count in my fingers- that tempt me to give it such a title. It made me fall in love with the cinema of the rising sun and loose my good opinion for the Bushido. Later, ""Ghost Dog"" helped me to balance this a bit. 8)The tragedy that rolls down throughout the story forces any sensitive person to take sides and get involved with the plot, and the incredible action movie ending can only produce enthusiasm to the viewer who feels more thirsty for revenge than our ronin!Well, anyway, if you are {a} a man {b} who has the sense of honor and {c} don't consider Bush as the best thing that ever happened to the USA,this is your movie!(Few things in this century are still treated with such respect as the samurai tradition. Mostly because people do not understand its full dimentions. Watching this controversial and highly realistic film can make someone loose all his respect for beautiful legents who are mostly based on lies and an invented sense of honor and duty). Tolerance for old B/W films who don't have any special effects but they do have a plot, is also a must for enjoy it. Eutyhite!",Hara-Kiri
89,SaidNDone,Masterpiece,10,20 September 2020,"The first thought I had after finishing Harakiri was that I had just watched a Greek tragedy. Every aesthetic element of Harakiri from the empty scenery to the haunting soundtrack is stripped bare, sharpening the viewer's focus onto the human elements in Tsugumo's description of how his family was led to its fate by the hypocrisy of the Shogunate's hierarchy.The brilliance of the movie isn't in its relatively simplistic plot, but rather in the way it makes use of Tsugumo's framed story to detail the impact social codes have on those left behind by society's unfeeling march forward.As Tsugumo tells his story to an increasingly hostile audience, each scene serves to add further evidence to his point - which is the inherent cruelty in applying an unfeeling Samurai ""honor"" code to a messy reality. This goes on until the final act, in which he brilliantly exposes the tie between honor and the Samurai's most sacred symbols as a facade.In the final act, Tsugumo breaks the Imagawa Clan's self-righteous view of themselves with two actions. The first occurs in the final moments of his frame story, where he inverts the traditional relationship between a Samurai's sword and honor - turning Chijiwa's Bamboo sword, which was previously a symbol of dishonor into a symbol of familial loyalty/love. The second occurs after the Imagawa Clan rejects Tsugumo's message - as their leaders are shown to be dishonorable according to their own honor code and the clan's ancestral armor is desecrated during the final fight, which culminates in the Clan resorting to the use of firearms (over their sacred swords) to take down Tsugumo.But as mentioned earlier, society grinds on, and the now disgraced clan cover up both Tsugumo's tragedy and their own dishonor with the stroke of a pen. The question is - will the Clan heed Tsugumo's advice when the wheels of history inevitably turn them to Ronin?",Hara-Kiri
90,cwkenreich,Exceeded expectations! Near perfect! Better than every Kurosawa film,10,9 June 2021,"Harakiri is an outsatanding and underrated Japanese masterpiece. It seems to be heavily overshadowed by so-called magnum opuses like seven samurai. However, this samurai film was truly incredible in almost every way. The visuals and the themes complimented each other perfectly. It really shed light on the samurai experience like no film before and subverts expectations with regards to numerous samurai cliches.The recurring mood of this movie is deceitful. Nothing should be interpreted at face value. Our protagonist Tsugumo enters seemingly disturbing the peace at the honorable House of Iyi. He even wears a dark outfit, deceiving one into thinking that he is evil in nature. One would expect that Tsugumo would promptly carry out his ""wish"" of dying honorably. Given that we know nothing about him and that the camera often keeps physical distance from him, he initially does not evoke pity. However he repeatedly prolongs the ritual, much to the annoyance of Sennukko. And Tsugumo finally tells his grand tale which subverts all of our expectations. It's revealed that he is the victim of corrupt government policies initiated by indifferent upper-class elites. He is really out to vent his grievances in front members of the elite.But the film doesn't stop there. Part of its magic was just truly how unpredictable it was. Not only was Tsugumo lying in his intentions, he revealed that three of his proposed ""seconds"" to his harakiri were not sick at all, but could not face the humiliation of losing their buns. The final lines in the film in which sennukko orders the events of the film to be whitewashed to preserve the House's dignity, accentuates the theme of subversion. This is supported when the camera cuts at some of the most climactic moments. While not my original observation, I'd like to echo other reviews in acknowledging how in every death or samurai battle, we never actually see anyone die, or have their hair cut off. It's as if the audience is denied the convenience of being eyewitnesses and instead must accept Sennukko's words with submission.I've read how this film, while taking place in the 17th century, has striking parallels to Japanese institutions during WWII, however I admit to being no aficionado on Japanese history.This was my interpretation of the film. Samurais are often depicted as saviors and honorable warriors (ahem all of kurosawa's films), but this interpretation of them has to be the most pitiful and revealing.In terms of entertainment value, this film was easily 10/10. We grow intrigued as our bereaved protagonist asks to commit ritual suicide after facing poverty. We then have to witness the cringy demise of one previous man named Chijiwa. As we are awaiting Tsugumo to succumb to the same fate, he creates tension by interrupting the procedure with his own anecdotes, where we learn an emotional backstory surrounding the loss of his job and ALL of his immediate family. As if this weren't intriguing enough, the suspense is cranked up when Tsugumo reveals how he retrieved the hair buns and preaches about the evil workings of the ruling class. The ending is a well earned and a well executed climax of realistic and authentic fight choreography for the time the film was made.Again, I don't know how historically accurate this film was and I'm certain many inevitably dismissed it as political propaganda, but the execution of this movie from a filmmaking standard was near meticulous in my opinion.Best Samurai film and probably the best foreign film I've ever seen! 10/10.",Hara-Kiri
91,Ricc0,A journey that you should undergo..,10,3 November 2016,"Tsugumo Hanshiro, a Samurai with no lord (ronin), goes to the estate of Li clan to commit Harakiri (Japanese ritual suicide), yet a senior counselor there tells him a story about the fate of a younger ronin that came to the clan holding the same request. The story that was intended to scare away Hanshiro only carried him to tell a story of his own and so he did in the oddest fashion. And through flashbacks we learn it and the more we know the more we understand.. the more we feel.. the more we think.Harakiri (1962), that its events are set out between 1619 and 1630 of the Edo period, is a perfect study of the human mind, heart, and soul. It is also a study of the human relations and that of the society and individual..Through its characters and their contradicting personalities you will learn a lot.. Sincerity and hypocrisy, faith and appearances, love and hate, caring and indifference, courage and fear... The social structure: flaws and corruptness.. The society's symbols and traditions: their depth and when they are only a cover. And then there is history: how it happens and then how it is written. This is all one thing about Harakiri and the other aspects that make a film are just as perfect.. the cinematography, soundtrack, acting.. every single aspect.. and the duels we see reminded me of the duels in ""The good, the bad, and the ugly', only that here it's with swords.Truly the film is a masterpiece.. a journey that you should undergo.",Hara-Kiri

94,uprashanthnayak,Slaying Faux Honour...,9,6 March 2016,"""Who can know the depths of another man's heart?"" Hanshuro TsugumoApart from its sheer story-telling gravitas and technical splendour, Kobayashi's Hara-kiri is especially lauded for its plea to look closer, to examine a little more deeply the troubles of those not as fortunate as us. When I watched it for the first time, I was blown away by the arresting wallop of this tension-saturated story's narration , and it was on the second viewing years later that I registered with more delicate acuity, its eloquent entreaty for a more compassionate look at the surface issues of our brethren. Particularly in Japan, the practice of bowing to the larger system and the concept of ""honour"" being maintained at all costs, looms especially large but of what use is honour if it makes us lose everything dear to us? Hara-kiri takes on the form of a formidable Samurai drama and builds this visceral sentiment with inexorable power, the vise of its narrative swirling and tightening until the physical carnage at the end isn't necessary - the foes have already been annihilated with gentle words. World-class cinematography and flawlessly strong acting further power this monochrome scorcher.Pic opens with a wide-angle black-'n'-white canvas , the neatness and sparse beauty of which is the trademark of director Masaki Kobayashi. Notice how clean these compositions are, whether it is the large ground ouside a chieftan's house, the inner courtyard with its settled pebbles and carefully coiffed platforms for sitting, or even a poor man's wooden house bereft of much conveniences and yet almost spacious in its tidy gestalt. The framing is immaculate when Motome Chijiwa (Akira Ishihama) - a young Samurai struggling for survival - sits with folded knee - in a martial lord's house in front of a tough-jawed warrior who listens to his case. It is 1630 in the Edo region of Japan - peace has been declared in the land but it has devolved into internal war for the highly trained swordsmen called Samurai - they find no employment now, jobs are scarce with workers pouring into any open job-site and Motome is pushed away by a supervisor who cries out that the supervisor will be punished if authorities find out that the formal warrior class is being employed for menial jobs. Motome reports to the House of Li , as other Samurai have done before him, that this utter penury is so dishonourable that he would rather commit Seppuku by disemboweling himself with his own sword in this martial house's courtyard as a final act of honour. The House of Li, manned by fierce-looking superiors, is fed up with this pattern of supposedly suicidal Samurais - they see that many such applicants are willing to accept some money and go away without killing themseles as they initially declared to do. At this stage, Kobayashi racks up the sense of foreboding , panic and icy fear with such elan that the ensuing twenty minutes ranks as one of the most implacable turn of events in black-'n'-white cinema. A few days later, a middle-aged man named Hanshuro Tsugomo (Tatsuya Nakadai), bearded and rather emaciated-looking, shows up at the House of Li with a similar request. He is told the story of Motome Chijiwa as a warning - but Tsugumo, with a wry expression that is beyond gallows humour, calmly states that he will indubitably execute as promised. As great as the previous tightly coiled sequence was, this succeding chapter matches it with its slow burn and unbearable tension which Tsugumo stretches far past breaking point with a story he unspools. Counsellor Saito (Rentaro Mikuni) , heading the house in the absence of the martial lord, is , to put it presisely - driven nuts - by this seemingly interminable narration by the grave-faced Tsugumo but I never got tired of hearing it as the latter lays one dialogue upon another like one revelatory card against the next one till the stakes indicate not just one death but many more. Saito , his strings plucked like a hen stripped to the bone , retreats to the house unable to take more.In other jidaigeki (period-films) like Kurosawa's great ""Throne of Blood"", the performances though solid do not evoke my specific praise but in Harakiri ,the thespian finesse is on prime display - this could very well have been a starkly lit theater-drama. One can almost feel the cool breeze of happiness coursing through Motome's smiling immensely relieved face after the stifling humidity of despair, alas later , stomach-churning panic sets in to seize his mien. Tsugumo's nominally amused ,mostly dead-serious physiognomy never ever raises its voice but the prosody of his message undulates with the timeless meaning of great scripture. And then there's Saito , more c**t than counsellor, who's so drunk with power and delusions of tough wisdom that his sobriety is nullified by incurable hauteur.I was vastly disappointed by the fight at the end on my first viewing - having brought me to the very peak of expectation, Harakiri's climactic sword-fight seemed not even close to the supremely choreographed ahead-of-its-time bristling magnificence of Daibosatsu toge's finisher. But then as Saito himself says , Tsugumo is a ""half-starved"" Samurai who's already been through many hells so it is perhaps unfair to expect him to again fight like Japan's greatest champion. The denouement is a sobering indictment of the way history often operates, and the film eventually reclaims its spell-binding emotional and technical territory . To watch Hara-kiri , then , is to acknowledge that even in 1962 when so much of the rest of the world was learning the ropes of top-tier movies, Japan was already capable of engineering peerless cinema.",Hara-Kiri
95,muddlyjames,Devastating study of male vanity.,10,6 February 2002,"While initially appearing to be a study of the eternal conflict between individual needs and the demands of tradition, HARAKIRI is actually a clear-eyed and savage indictment of human (particularly male) vanity.To me there are two key scenes in the film. First, the enforced ritual suicide of the young samurai early in the film. This has got to be one of the most brutal, toe-curling scenes ever put on film (although there is no gore). What is particularly striking is the juxtaposition of the twisting, writhing, screaming man against the silent, immobile, formally arranged background. This has the effect of giving the environment, or tradition/society/law, increased weight and making the individual appear weaker, transient, more mutable, and thus more subject to error. In other words Kobayashi appears to pay all due deference to the culture and belief system that have created the horror we have just witnessed. He consciously uses the the techniques of classic formalist Japanese cinema (static shots, formal spatial design, exactly replicated point of view shots, etc.) to give us a sense of the weight and power of custom bearing on the individual.The second scene comes at the end of the middle section of the film during which time we have been given a detailed examination of the relationships between the members of the small family and the increasing sense of desperation and despair that has entered the home with the deadening encroachment of poverty. When the temple officials tell the tale of the ""honorable death"" of the young father in this setting (they are somewhat more brightly lit - ""cleaner"" than their surroundings) THEY are now what appears mutable or insubstantial and their talk of fame, honor, and tradition is perceived as pompous, empty cant. In short they are shown as posturing, bullying members of some ""boys club"" whose membership is based on vanity and who are totally divorced from the realities of existence. These realities would include, most prominently, our duties to our family and friends, not just our personal honor (ego?). At this point in the film the young father's begging now appears an act of courage and virtue, his suicide would have been one of cowardice and vanity. The film suggests that suicide may be the easier of the choices faced by those placed in the position of this father in this culture. Death provides social approval, lasting fame, and freedom from the grind of responsibility. Continuing to be a husband and father would here only bring disgrace. This could be seen as a powerful indictment of what can occur when women are not accorded a place of respect and/or authority within a culture.This is a passionate, clear-eyed, stringently crafted film that is marred only very slightly by occasional use of that addiction of 60's filmakers: the zoom lens, and an (admittedly exciting) action ending that somewhat distracts from the film's main themes (love the toppling of that idol though). 9.5/10.",Hara-Kiri
96,souplipton,One of the Better Films of Japanese Cinema,9,22 July 2015,"Harakiri is a must see film. A ronin's appearance bears much more significance than it seems at first glance. As his tale unfolds, the tension in the film can be felt as it grows and grows incredibly until it is nearly unbearable. When the tension breaks in the showdowns between our hero and the samurai of the house of Iyi, it is with a vitality that bursts from the screen. The ending is incredible, tying together all the themes in a bloodbath that offers no hope that this will not happen again. The selfish and cruel house of Iyi grows in stature and there seems to be no prospect of betterment for the honourable warriors. The film exposes the bushido code as a farse wherein the honourable are exploited by the selfish. Incredibly shot, written, acted, it is an astounding achievement by director Masaki Kobayashi.

100,MeesTW,"Wicked, smart and beautiful.",9,23 September 2017,"Kobayashi making a superb Samurai film in the early '60s is like David Vs. Goliath. Kurosawa was on top of his game at this time, and somehow Masaki Kobayashi managed to create a Samurai film on par with the quality of Kurosawa, while staying true to his own style and merit instead of copying what others did before him.The first thing that struck me was that this film, more than 50 years later, still looks fantastic. Especially the great use of high contrast lighting, something you barely see in Japanese productions, set the tone both visually and thematically. The director of photography uses a lot of symmetric shots which look beautiful but tell a story as well. For me the highlight of this film was Motome Chijiiwa's seppuku. This scene was shocking, absurd and also very unpredictable. Excellent editing and cinematography created an unforgettable, yet uncomfortable moment. The turn of events, which slowly unfold as the film progresses is unexpected and will surprise you. But most of all, it will impress you. The director uses some very (without giving too much away) notable techniques to strengthen the effect.Tatsuya Nakadai, one of the greats in Samurai cinema, has some of the most amazing body language you will ever see in movies! I noticed how much work and detail he put into this character by not focusing on his eyes, but rather on his feet - which show that he really is portraying a Samurai. My only flaw is that the beginning of the film, the first twenty minutes or so, does not set the tone which I found to be a bit confusing and off putting.This is one of the greatest films from the golden age of Japanese cinema. It holds up very well and you will walk away very satisfied. If you get the chance, go watch it!",Hara-Kiri

As the main character tells his story you feel more for his pain than nearly Kurosawa movie. For years, I thought Akira Kurosawa was the end all for truly great cinema, but after seeing Kobayashi's opus in Seppuku, it is obvious that 1960's Japanese Cinema had two masters.Seppuku is certainly one of those flicks that makes you say ""Oh SH*T"" halfway through. A deep and enriching story that just keeps getting better as more of the movie is revealed to you. While it doesn't reveal itself to you in a normal unraveling, but rather with a wonderfully told and filmed flashback (while admiringly very long and drawn out - even characters in the film call it so).Everything from the beautiful camera work to the acting delivery is absolutely superb. The close-ups within the flick actually deliver a wealth of information about the scenes that spoken words could only touch on. Truly a masterpiece and worth the wait from Netflix.",Hara-Kiri
104,atitu3,A Japanese Masterpiece About the Dark Side of The Samurai Culture...,10,7 September 2020,"*First off, I want to say that I am a Big Akira Kurosawa Fan and What He did with Japanese Movies no one else can, His movies such as Seven Samurai, Rashomon, Ikiru and Many more are Great films but This film Harakiri Which is Directed by Masaki Kobayashi is my most favorite Japanese film and It's arguably the Best Samurai Movie Ever Made... I think It should be talked about more and more People should know about this film..*It's a Japanese Jidaigeki (Period Drama mostly set in Edo Period) film takes place between 1619 to 1630 in the rule of Tokugawa Shogunate. At the time, it was common For Ronin to request to commit Seppuku (Suicide,Harakiri) in the palace of courtyard in the hopes of recieving money or help from the feudal lords.*The story is Simple. A Warrior without a lord, Hanshiro Tsugumo arrives at the state of Li Clan and says that He wishes to commit Seppuku. The Daimyo's Senior Counselor Saito tells Hanshiro about another Ronin who came earlier to commit Seppuku... and Then the story becomes Interesting.. I don't want to reveal anymore of the story, Just want to say that Every scene of this Movie is Just wow! Every Conversation in The courtyard of The Li clan is just Epic and Mesmerizing... The Action, Background Score, Writing, Cinematography everything is Perfect and Memorable.*It is a timeless classic because It will be always relatable. As the Hypocrisy about Honor and Code, To do anything to preserve the Order.. It makes anyone think that What is Right and What is Wrong after all!*I don't know about the Director Masaki Kobayashi very much, Didn't see his Films prior to this, But I think He did a phenomenal Job in this and many people thinks it's his best.
The actors are very good, Specially Tatsuya Nakadai in the role of Hanshiro and Rentaro Mikuni in the role of Saito did such a fabulous job. Tatsuya Nakadai gives a Aura about his character Hanshiro that You cannot feel anything but Interested!*This is a Must Watch. And if You don't know about Harakiri, It is kind of a Ritual Suicide for Samurai, Google it to know more.. I said Earlier about the movie being the best Samurai movie ever made and I also want to add that It is one of the Best Movie Ever Made....",Hara-Kiri
105,lstrawser,A Gem of Japanese Cinema,10,13 April 2006,"Harakiri is an excellent human drama set in feudal Japan that involves a ronin presenting himself to a powerful clan and asking to commit harikiri. However, through a series of flashbacks we see that this ronin is motivated by more than the idea of dying honorably. The events that follow are a critique of the feudal system and a celebration of dying for one's beliefs.Every frame in Harikiri is wonderfully composed and a treat to view. The cinematography is crisp, the sets wonderful and the actors are spectacular. Much can be said about this film's technical merits as well as its social implications. I found out about this film through my love of Akira Kurosawa's samurai dramas (who else...) and I must say that it is very different from Kurosawa-sans work although it draws inevitable comparisons. Due to its themes, Harikiri is more of an anti samurai film. Generally Kurosawa's work seems to glorify the honor of the samurai and celebrate them as Japanese heroes by showing them gloriously in battle. Kurosawa is the Japanese John Ford, taking an icon from his culture and celebrating it. Harikiri exposes the virtues that Kurosawa portrays as being ""a facade"" to directly quote the film.I say this so as not to mislead any potential viewers, I do not know enough about Japanese history to judge what the samurai really stood for and really I am not concerned with the idea. This is the only Kobyashi film I have seen and it has been brought to my attention that many of his films deal with similar themes. All in all I think that Harikiri is a wonderful film that offers a new take on feudal Japan.",Hara-Kiri

If you love films, of any genre you have to see this one at least once (it's characters and story are that universal).  Although set during the twilight of the samurai era, Harakiri has  a story which can shake the norms of any modern culture anywhere in the world.  The secure but lonely life of an old warrior and his daughter are like a house built on sand and when the wind of change blows there is a stench from the  injustice and apathy from other samurai who stilll sleep in the illusion of their usefulness.   And no, this film is not about revenge, swords and just killing, in fact the action is so concentrated and sudden it's role is to  jar the audience out of the spell the director and actors and actresses cast and screams ""this is it, it's the end, it's real, and you'll remember every second forever'.",Hara-Kiri

108,nanana-batman,Blown Away,10,5 June 2011,"I believe coming into the movie blindly is the only way to view it properly. The film is intelligent enough to explain everything you will need to know though you may know nothing of Samurai culture. This film is amazing to say the least! It forces introspection and doesn't punish you for it, rather you have to come to terms with the fact that you condemned a man with out knowing his story. At least that was how it occurred in my case. Although slow at first, this film picks up momentum and easily enthralls the viewer with a magnificent showcase of storytelling. Of all the films I've seen in my International Cinema class this has to be my favorite, just a top notch film all the way around.",Hara-Kiri
109,rauldiul,Beyond its time,10,22 December 2012,"This is a genuine, unique and sincere samurai film. The flawless direction Kobayashi presents to us depletes all criticisms. The prudent pace the story moves in is in itself the depiction of the samurai society: the extreme respect, the omnipresent rituals of courtesy, the will to listen to your foes, the patience.The key in the greatness of this film -my favourite samurai film, personally- lies in the meticulous (negative reviewers would have to say here: ""painstaking"") representation of the relationships between these people who live for and by an immutable code of honor,and how the story ends up telling us that, in the end -for better or for worse- man is above any social principle or code. Hanshiro Tsumogo (the main character) is, after all, only demanding an apology for the way the young Motome Chijiiwa was treated, but we see how arrogance stands in the way of the samurai code, and he's left empty-handed.On the other side of the coin, Motome Chijiiwa's act of love for his wife and son, which involves his total humiliation, again defies the samurai code.""After all, this thing we call samurai honor is ultimately nothing but a facade."" says Hanshiro Tsugumo after recounting his story. Not facade in the sense of fictitious, but in the sense of superficial. Because there may be hundreds, thousands of different cultures in the world, but in the end we all love the same way, we hate alike, we envy in the same manner...",Hara-Kiri

Yes, this is a review of Seppuku, a Japanese film released in 1962.  Perhaps it took a non-Westerner, free of all of the cultural baggage and ridiculous associations, to see straight into the heart of the tragic mode and make it palpable and alive in the twentieth century.  That is not all: the black and white cinematography is both formally assured and often outrageously daring; the soundtrack is one of the finest efforts of the greatest Japanese composer of the 20th century (or any century for that matter); the acting is demonically inspired; and the narrative is relentlessly gripping and involving.  The film illuminates the relationship between the individual and society and between society and history.  It is a tender meditation on familial love and the ties of friendship that transcend even death.  This film will cut open your bowels, pull your soul out, and force you to stare it in the face.  There may be other films that attain similar heights, but I cannot imagine any film, ever, being more perfect. Forget Citizen Kane, Seven Samurai, the Godfather, etc. etc. all of those commodified canonical works that everybody raves about because everybody else is raving about them.  Don't get me wrong, they're fine--but this stuff is 200 proof.  See it today.  Buy it yesterday.",Hara-Kiri

Nor am I proud that not only have I spent so many years of my life in front of a flickering screen but that I actually know the number of films that I have seen.With that said, ""Seppuku"" (""Hara-kiri"") makes that whole trip worth while. For every hundred pieces of celluloid tripe you can be fortunate to find a diamond in the rough and for me that was my first experience with this Kobayashi masterpiece. Pure enjoyment, pure excitement.The film is brilliantly constructed and multi-layered in such a way that the film defies genre classification. To call it a ""samurai film"" is akin to categorizing ""Psycho"" as a murder mystery. ""Seppuku"" could easily slide into the mystery, suspense, drama, or western genres and feel right at home. Perhaps an eastern film noir, if you will.Kobayashi's telling of the tale incorporates elements of despair, tradition, fortitude, revenge but mostly love, pride and honor in a grand visual style.The story's setting, direction and Tatsuya Nakadai's strong performance invite the inevitable comparison to Kurosawa and his favorite samurai Toshiro Mifune. All are of such high merit that I would propose ignoring the temptation to compare and appreciate the genius involved in ""Seppuku"".For those who have not seen ""Seppuku"" of course I strongly recommend that you do so but I also suggest that you avoid reading any synopsis and take delight in watching the tale unfold.10/10 (and not too many of the 6,035 are 10's)",Hara-Kiri

114,bobcatlew,A great story of revenge that is told with devastating effect.,10,12 June 2000,"""Another one? Is there no end?""So the clan elder of the House of Iyi greets the news that Hanshiro Tsugumo (Tatsuya Nakadai) is at his gate with an odd request.  Hanshiro, an old, impoverished, unemployed samurai, seeks use of their mansion to perform harakiri, ceremonial suicide that involves self-disembowlment and is an honorable death for a samurai living in disgrace.But in a time of peace, Japan abounds with ex-warriors who threaten to perform this rite only to extort money from weak-willed clans.  In light of such dishonorable conduct, the House of Iyi has adopted stern measures: Any samurai who threatens to perform this rite at their gate will be forced to do so.  Thus a younger ex-warrior, Motome Chigiiwa, met his fate.  Coming with the same request, this unfortunate youth was forced to carry out the rite with a bamboo sword -- ""an unsightly affair.""  The clan elder would warn the older Hanshiro away with the story of Motome's death, but the old warrior is resolved to die.Things, however, are not what they seem.  Hanshiro seems to have more on his mind than suicide.  And, as he relates his own lifestory to the warriors of Iyi clan, not only are their stern measures called into question, but also the very honor of which they are so proud.Seppuku is an awesome story of revenge told with devastating effect.  By the time you know what the story is really about, you yourself have cast judgement on the characters.  Then things turn on you, and nothing appears as it did before.  In this film a tragic story, great sword duels, haunting atmospheric music, and an exciting final battle combine to form what I think is an overlooked masterpiece.  Director Masaki Kobayashi does to the samurai genre what Sam Pekinpah will later do to the western in The Wild Bunch:  He takes the samurai code and turns it upon its head.  This film is great, and worth every repeated watching.",Hara-Kiri

After cutting other samurai cuts his head of to end the pain. And like this a samurai will die honorably.Seppuku tells a story of one elderly samurai named Hanshiro Tsugumo who has lots of things to tell before his harakiri. He tells a story about his beautiful daughter and her life. You can tell that the other samurais aren't actually very pleased with his story telling because the man just doesn't know when to stop. When Hanshiro finally finishes his stories there won't be his harakiri. No, then a great battle will begin. The influence of Seppuku in modern cinema is obvious. The final battle sequence is lot like in Kill Bill vol.1. And that's not the only thing that is similar to some movies of this date.Tatsuya Nakadai does great job in Hanshiro's role and the rest of the cast aren't bad either. Visual aspects of Seppuku are beautiful and the movie itself is very tough provoking. Well it's hard for me to put all into words because of the language barrier but I'll just say this: Seppuku is amazingly deep and beautiful movie which criticizes the mindless samurai ritual they call harakiri. I'm sorry I can't say much - after all I am young and Finish so English doesn't come so naturally for me.

It presents us with a rich and thrilling story that has us glued to our seats as we follow different Samurai through an unwinding mystery surrounding the death of a young Ronin.The film gives us a glimpse into the less than ideal lives of the Samurai, and shows us the truly human issues that they had to deal with, like family and loss, instead of simply showing battle scenes. The film is about the priorities that a man has to set for himself, and the conflicting values between the Bushido code, and the family life of a samurai.Through it's form of story structure, the film also teaches us to never judge a book by its cover, by changing who we perceived to be the protagonist originally.

118,djtaylor114,A Fine Example of Japanese Cinema,8,7 June 2011,"Masaki Kobayashi's Hara-Kiri is a great example of an all-around, expertly-crafted film. What is surprising is that this film is not as well-known as some of the other Japanese films from the golden age of Japanese cinema. Without a doubt, this film should stand high with the rest of them. The film seems to begin with a standard samurai story, but it soon branches off into a much more intricate and intriguing story dealing with love, suicide, dishonor, and revenge. One of the things that strikes me as particularly impressive about this film is the cinematography, which definitely seems ahead of its time. There is a lot of focus on the moving camera, and some of the shots flow so smoothly and capture the action in such artistically-stimulating ways that at times it is hard to believe this film was created in 1962. Some particularly modern shots are the ones during the opening credits where the camera dollies ever-so-slightly down tight hallways. The opening and closing to the film are of the same shot of samurai armor against a black background, and there is something artistically brilliant about this; beginning and ending a movie with the same shot seems to perfectly wrap things up and give a transcendental meaning to the content of the film contained between the two identical shots. In addition to the staging of the camera, the high-contrast blacks and whites make every shot in the film beautiful to look at.The story in Hara-Kiri is very emotional and can resonate even with modern-day Westerners that have little to no understanding of Samurai culture. One of the main themes, which revolves around the timelessness and importance of love and family, particularly had an effect on me, and drew me into the emotions of Hanshiro, the protagonist of the story. Overall, Hara-Kiri is a film that everyone should see. It is because of films like this that I have such an interest in filmmaking; there is no end to the inspiration that can come from such films that touch on the deepest questions of life and reach down into our innermost primal emotions.",Hara-Kiri
119,nishad-2,A different side to Samurai,7,7 June 2011,"I'd never seen a Samurai film before this one. But I would assume that Masaki Kobayashi's Hara-Kiri isn't like your traditional samurai film, this one is different so I'm told. I'll admit, I expected ninja fight scenes and a lot of fast zoom in's to crazy ninja faces. But this film is more about the Japanese culture and more or less, ones honor as a Samurai. At the start of the film, we meet a ronin by the name of Hanshiro Tsugumo who applies to the Iyi Clan for the opportunity to commit open and willing Hara-Kiri- ritualized self-destruction. The court official relates the request to another ronin's similar request. Kobayashi takes direct aim at Japan's rigid system of clans, Samurai and the almost obsessive code of honor. Instead of action filled fight scenes and sword battles, we are filled with thick dialogue. I don't think Kobayashi likes the Samurai culture very much. Though it was beautifully filmed, Hara-Kiri wasn't to my liking. I guess subconsciously, I expected much different than it turned out to be.",Hara-Kiri
120,Almanac123,Harakiri is one of the best Japanese films ever.,10,18 June 2014,"""Harakiri"" is about standing up to authority. Hanshiro is a Ronin who visits the Iyi clan because he needs an honorable place to commit suicide with a samurai sword. Already I'm captured by the dedication of Ronin who are willing to sacrifice their own life in the name of honor. Hanshiro learns that his son in law Motome had earlier committed Harakiri in the same room. Motome's reasons are emotionally understandable considering his young son was dying. No father should have to bury their own child. The film tackles the subject head on. Hanshiro is facing the same dilemma because it's his grandson and daughter who succumb to death. The film is very dramatic and suspenseful for tackling these kind of issues such as death, disease and suicide. These are things that anybody could go through and experience. It makes the film very relatable that these characters are not invincible but instead very human. The Iyi clan doesn't trust Hanshiro and a battle erupts when they learn the true circumstances of Hanshiro's visit. It's breathtaking battle sequence in which Hanshiro battles the entire samurai clan. It's one of the greatest fight scenes ever filmed. What helps make the sequence so powerful is that it's one man against several. Many people must feel the kind of emotions that Hanshiro must feel. The feeling of being an outsider and a loner. He also somebody who has nothing left. He has lost his family. He has nothing to lose by challenging the Iyi Clan. He's a character to be admired because he is able to defend himself for a long time against them. He eventually commits Harakiri even as the remaining samurai arrive to shoot him down. Imagine the strength of Hanshiro's character as the Samurai can not defeat him with their own swords. They must resort to guns. Hanshiro shows strength of character because he'd rather sacrifice himself rather than be killed by one of them. The film begins and ends with the image of samurai armor. At the beginning, the armor commands respect and honor just by the way it looks. By the end, the viewer has become disgusted by what the armor represents. It's a beautiful film with something to say about Japanese culture and everyone.",Hara-Kiri

The so much worshipped ""honor"" turns out to be mostly fake in the house. The samurai turn out to be liars pretending to be ill to avoid committing suicide. The young guy who is portrayed as dishonored and humiliated in the beginning actually turns out to be a brave one. And the fact that the father was able to fight a dozen of well-trained and well-fed samurais at the end really shows that the concept was not as authentic and romantic as we might perceive it nowadays.

Kobayashi appeal to the audience is to reveal some truth behind and otherwise glorified samurai lifestyle. He tries to show the although a samurai's word is his bond and they follow a certain code, when that code or bond is broken for your own benefit, things typically collapse. This transforms to an system with a strict code governing its members, but is especially prevalent in the Japanese culture. Set during the Tokugawa Era, Kobayashi wants people to recognize that human life if much more important than any ""Bushido Code"" for samurais. Cinematographically, Kobayashi utilizes many black-and-whites, in a harsh landscape almost stylized like a painting. Emotionally, I really felt for Motome, Hanshiro, and his daughter and their struggle just to get by. Motome's fatal attempt to join the Iyi daimyo and his body's return to Hanshiro's are heart-wrenching moments that seem impossible to believe are actually carried out.",Hara-Kiri

Some of the film it was a bit rough for me to identify certain parts of what was going on and the whole concept during the film but this is what I came up with.From what I took from it was Hanshiro Tsugumo enters the house of lords of another character named Kageyu Saito. Tsugumo wanted to commit in a form of Japanese ritual suicide by disembowelment (Hara-kiri). This act was only reserved for samurais only. While getting ready for his suicide, Hanshiro goes over his time with Saito and the retainers. Hanshiros lord's house was thought out to be a threat and surrounded by toppled by forces. One of Hanshiro's friends committed the same ritual (Hara-kiri) which caused Hansiro to watch after his son. Towards the end of the film Hanshiro tracks down three of the retainers of the lord's house and blames them for the deaths of his family. But, instead of killing the retainers in a battle he disgraces them by cutting off the topknots of their heads which is far worst then death.At the end of the film, Hanshiro is attacked by all of the retainers and must fight all of them. More retainers arrive after Hanshiro fights all the retainers. This is when Hanshiro decides his time is over and commits hara-kiri to die as a samurai with honor.In this film you could really feel the power of how much honor meant to these samurai's. It was all they cared about and nothing else mattered. These films shows the ""new"" turning point in the 17th century between samurai's that fought with swords and the new military that began to use guns. This film represents retaining a person's honor after disgrace",Hara-Kiri
124,nicholaslalich,"Harakiri, the classic Samurai tale.",8,5 June 2011,"Harakiri is a classic tale of the Samurai, or in this case the Ronin. Masaki Kobayashi does an extraordinary job of incorporating western elements along with typical Japanese humor and vengeance, to deliver one of the key Jidai-Geki films in the history of Japanese cinema. The central idea of the film is to expose the audience to the egotistical, dishonorable side of the samurai, and does so by following Hanshiro (the protagonist) as he calls out the Iyi Clan for disobeying the Bushido Code. Samurai's live off honor, but in a world full of war and violence, this film proves that all morals and honor can be lost, and reveals the sick ways that people go about getting a form of entertainment.",Hara-Kiri
125,igotasecret,A Marvelous and Brilliant Film about Suicide.,9,6 June 2011,"Now I may be biased about this movie over others due to the fact that I love watching Japanese cinema, but Harakiri was a well crafted and brilliantly well thought out movie made by Masaki Kobayashi. All the actors and actresses acted well on their individual roles. I enjoyed watching and learning the ways of the Samurai Culture. The Samurai Culture was all about obedience, honor and respect. However, one may question whether or not these samurai codes were too strict during these times. The way the film demonstrates Hara-Kiri in a well mannered and carefully crafted method in which does not disturb the viewers to the point where they would call it sickening or disturbing. I could it simply call it a beautiful, yet deadly ritual to acknowledge. The story, itself, is also very well made. There have been quite a few Japanese movies that have tried to implement a story in their rather interesting (quirky) plots, but fail to capitalize by making the film much more confusing. Most Japanese films these days also try to make their movies more vague and make their audience question the characters actions and story plot lines. However, this movie is straight forward and to the point. I really like this film and the way it was constructed. It gave me more insight of the life of the samurai. Even though it doesn't come close to my favorites Japanese movies such as Departures, Battle Royale, Spirited Away or Confessions, it does the subject of Harakiri justice where it fully explains the way of the samurai code well.",Hara-Kiri
126,edith-enberg,Hara-Kiri opens up more than only the stomach....,10,6 June 2011,"I watched this movie in a film class at SMC, in California, and it really opened me up to this genre. Before watching it I had never watched a single Japanese samurai movie or anything related to it and I really enjoyed Hara-Kiri and how the Japanese culture was captured. Never would I think that a movie this slow would keep me alert and make me want to continue watching, it was almost what I believed made the movie so special, it's different from anything I have ever experienced. Fighting movies and movies about war in general are usually so brutal and extreme but this story takes its time, no rush and it makes it even more powerful!",Hara-Kiri
127,twoteatoroomtwotwo,film about hypocrisy and hierarchy of values,9,7 June 2011,"Beautify crafted movie. I really enjoyed the visual side of ""Hara-kiri."" I appreciate simple and well balanced cinematography. This movie was another good example that simple composition and slow movement of the camera can have bigger impact than ""nowadays"" extremely busy, and showy cinematography. I like the fact that the film is black and white (1962). A strong contrast, really dark blacks and really bright whites, makes it visually really strong... which I think emphasizes the story, where we have this ""right and wrong"" (""black and white"") samurai honor code. I think that this movie is very universal in a sense of introduced cultural aspects and asked questions, which can be seen more general. What is more important: the life of their own families or following the rules to save their honor? Finally, what is the greater disgrace to the samurai, ""bend the neck"" and humiliate the time of the request, to commit suicide with hunger, or to lose hair-tip of samurai. The answer to these questions, in a context of the Japanese tradition, can not be easily answered... but I think we can ask ourself how strong are we impacted by cultural or social rules... and going further to realize that part of those who should protect the values and follow the rules, are the one who break them. There is one scene in the move I could not watch, hara-kiri with bamboo sword. It was really realistically shot- long take with a close-up. Even it was back and white and the blood did not look ""real"", I was really disturbed, but In the same time I think this scene was necessary to emphasize brutality and nonsense of hara-kiri. After watching final scene in this movie I have no doubt that Quentin Tarrantino, before he shoot ""Kill Bill"", has watched big masters of Japaniese cinema...",Hara-Kiri
128,ddaallday,One of the greatest Samurai movies ever made!,9,7 June 2011,"Amazing, old school Samurai movie that truly knocks your socks off! At first I thought the film was moving a bit slow however I never lost interest and it kept me on my feet. A great story about two samurai's in the 1630's, this film did a wonderful job of portraying the multi-sided dimensions of the characters. The film was full of action, suspense, great dialogue, wonderful fighting scenes and plenty of thought. This was the first movie that actually got me more interested in the whole Samurai culture and I will definitely check another one out because of this one. Overall, it is a movie about the facades we all put up and the people we really are deep down.",Hara-Kiri
129,clairetianqihou,the theme of Harakiri,10,18 June 2014,"Many describe the spirit of Bushido in Japanese films, such as Akira Kurosawa's ""Yojimbo"" , but the only one can use accurate wolds to present the spirit of bushido is ""Harakir "" As the third Tokugawa shogun implement centralized, most warriors face to unemployment . From this perspective, the warrior's spirit cannot defense the social and environmental. Thus , in Asian culture we always said "" a penny can make a hero death "" It is this really world. Unemployed samurai want to become agricultural workers class. In fact , it seems unable to be come true . Daughter wants to contiued her father's class , but her father has self-esteem. At that time, the main character's wife and children got sick and made ​​him unable to do anything. He despises those princes of the ronin samurai ritual extortion tactics, and eventually even be fulfilled in himself. The worse things is amurai katana long been his pawn. ""Harakiri"" shocking episode in the history of cinema during the most intense dramatic conflict. Film ""Bicycle theft in mind,"" is present soul struggle between good and bad evil's conflict, but ""Seppuku"" is human life fighting. The main character faces the threat of death he does not fear, he just want to give him two days more, because he had to go back home and face his wife and children dying. But the spirit of bushido take him own life. Feeling with bamboo cut yourself! The director according to use this kind of "" dull knife"" cutting the audience's mind; he has completely explains the Japanese cherry shake spirit , which also analyzes the solution behind the despicable unbearable. Although the lady at the last minute cannot to keep samurai honor, but those warrior have already lost their spirit. The theme of "" Harakiri"" touch our heart , despicable and criticism on human nature has a neat inked, which also highlighted the lack of warrior Humanity false pomp and goodwill. Below a sharp blade, the director cuts the most reluctant fact to us. That is the really world at that back grand, also let us to think-- life must be take off all masks , then we can feel and reflection by ourselves.",Hara-Kiri
130,pierreschlum,Comical questioning of authority,10,17 June 2014,"Similarities between Kobayashi's Harakiri and films of the French new wave arose to me under the comical disobedience of authority. While the authority being questioned in movies such as Godard's ""Breathless"" is mostly directed towards the rules of filming present at the time, the authority being dismissed here is obviously the one behind the Bushido code, held by Saito. The combat scenes seem authentic in a way that is almost comical--ignoring what they may look like ideally, the director is able to make us feel the adrenalin present within Hanshiro during the fight scenes. This comical use of real actions, along with the demystification of the Iyi clan leader, helps expose the viewer to the idealized values present during the Tokugawa era, which although questionable, have been believed by many.",Hara-Kiri
131,emilylippman,A Relevant Masterpiece,10,18 June 2014,"In ""Harakiri,"" director Kobayashi creates a compelling, beautifully shot jidaigeki that has proved to have timeless thematic relevance, even in the context of our modern American culture. The film chronicles Hanshiro, an unemployed ronin with no options left, as he approaches the Iyi Clan in hopes to, if nothing else, exact vengeance for his deceased family members and point out the cruel hypocrisy of the Bushido Code.As evidenced many times throughout the course of this masterful film, strict adherence to the Bushido Code is, ironically, dishonorable. Clearly, even Kobayashi realizes that the code itself is not inherently bad; however, the problem with such strict adherence to any set of rules is that it diminishes reason, logic, and, most importantly, basic humanity. Kobayashi demonstrates the ridiculousness of the Code by having Hanshiro turn out to be the character that most truly and honestly exemplifies the Code- he comes to the Iyi Clan on behalf of his family and, at the end, stays true to his word and commits seppuku. All in all, ""Harakiri"" is an artful, deeply meaningful film with much to say- truly a piece of cinematic history. I find it to be particularly relevant today, given modern socioeconomic issues like unemployment, both at home and abroad. Unfortunately, many individuals are left in a state of self-induced shame. However, Kobayashi's film urges individuals to consider the less-than-honorable outside forces that may have contributed to their plight. This film is important because it emphasizes that, even well intended governments, institutions, and other authorities become so wrapped up in themselves that they deny humanity, just as they did in the plot of ""Harakiri.""",Hara-Kiri
132,briannadevons,"""The Samurai Code is a facade""",9,17 June 2014,"How far would you go to protect your family and honor? What happens when the two collide and your forced to chose one over the other? For the protagonist in this film, Hanshiro believes their comes a point in time where family has to be a priority over everything, even if it means going against everything that your culture stands for. Japan embraces strict cultural patterns and rules and for a samurai, their is a fine line between compliability and morality when forced to follow the Bushido code. This film questions the rationality of following dogmatic practices when it results to unethical behavior. As the movie opens up with a narration from a book and closes in the same way, Kobayashi also questions the validity of history and the subjectivity of the truth. All in all, this film stands out amongst other samurai movies as it criticizes the core foundation of a culture rooted in rules and rivalry.",Hara-Kiri
133,skyblue4eva,Seppuku to show,10,18 June 2014,"""Harakiri"" directed by Masaki Kobayashi is a beautifully shot film. I could feel every shot in the film is meticulously planned before shooting. Even though it is black-and-white film, cinematography is just beyond amazing.Gut is to Japanese cultural belief as the heart is to Western belief, Japanese thinks there are one's mind, will and courage in his/her abdomen and therefore seppuku is showing everything of one's self to others.The border line between how one acts and how one is perceived by others is very thin. Following Bushido code was like the meaning of life for samurais, but during the Tokugawa era, many of them became ronins and the meaning of Bushido decayed as well. Bushido became more like a hypocritical act to show to others but not a code to live upon. And Hanshiro visits Iyi clan to tell Bushido is just a facade.The story unfolds within several different frame stories by different perspectives. Motome, Hanshiro's son-in-law, is introduced first by Counselor Saito. Saito tells Hanshiro a story about Motome and is depicted as a coward, sham samurai. Then Motome is described by Hanshiro later in the film, and is described differently this time and how the audiences perceive Motome's character becomes different in every person. This reminded me of ""Rashomon"" (Kurosawa Akira, 1950) in that how a character is perceived differently in different stories and how differently a character is told by how the storyteller perceived him/her.The history is written by the survivors and nothing seems to be changed. However, Kobayashi brilliantly uses the same shot in the beginning and at the end of the film to show how audiences are affected by the story.",Hara-Kiri
134,UrielABanuelos,A great Japanese film!,7,12 February 2014,"I had the belief that ""Harakiri"" was going to be a boring Japanese movie. Masaki Kobayshi the director shut me up completely. By the time I finished watching this film I was stunned by how good it actually was and had me thinking that I shouldn't judge a book by it's cover. Although it's good the film does gets boring, mainly in the beginning then it has a roller-coaster of emotions, then the final showdown just leaves you stunned. The film itself is a masterpiece in Japanese cinema as this is the film that put Japan on the cinema map and laid the foundation for many other masterpieces from Japan. I would recommend this film to viewers who like samurai type films.",Hara-Kiri
135,joseelias207,Samurais Rock!!!,9,16 June 2014,"WOW, This movie has it all. Comedy, Drama, Action. This was one of my first Samurai Movies that I have seen. It shows the real struggle when someone is left jobless or in this case masterless (Ronin). During this time Samurai where paid instead to kill themselves, so they would go to other Samurai house and requested to use their garden to kill them self or commit (Harakiri). This movie makes you think twice in not to judge people bad about their situation, some houses believe that some samurais would just come to try to commit Harakiri just to take the movie instead. The scene where Harakiri is perform is very painful to watch, I felt so bad for the protagonist. This movie is not in English and you will need to read subtitles, overall I enjoyed it and so will you.",Hara-Kiri
136,rivera_edwin_m,Beautiful Black and White,10,18 June 2014,"I recently watched this movie and I fell in love it. It beautiful black and white scenes are perfect. In the film we follow Hanshirō a rōnin or warrior without a lord a ronin who has arrived to the estate of the Ii clan, looking for a suitable place to perform seppuku (harakiri). As we learn through out the film Hanshirō had a bigger reason to be there. His family has been dishonored and teared apart because of the li clan. His son in law was made to do harakiri with a bamboo sticky while trying to save Hanshirō ill grandson that ultimately died. Hanshirō wanted justice to be brought upon on those who have offended his houshold. As a rōnin or warrior without a lord he has come to show the li clan what a honored samurai could do. The film revolves around the idea of honor and the essence of what a warrior is. I believe the directors choice to effortlessly connect this with the samurai armor introduced at the start of the film and end was perfect. The samurai armor represented the mirage of honor the li clan believed they had. Even at the end of the film Hanshirō a ronin had kept his honor and kept his promise to perform harakiri. Great film, one to be remembered.",Hara-Kiri
137,anastasiiapodrez,Follow the code,8,16 June 2014,"This is a very ambiguous movie. One commits seppuku whether his lord asks him to or he commits it because of the loss of faith. This story is about a ronin, basically an unemployed samurai. The protagonist in ""Harakiri"", Hanshiro, portrayed by Tatsuya Makadai, is the only one in the whole movie who actually follows the samurai code, and at the end he is killed by it. Violence takes place in the film as well, so make sure you are mentally prepared to watch people disemboweling themselves with bamboo swords. I enjoyed the emotional cut of the movie and instant shots which really reflect characters' despair and happy flashbacks from their past. Interesting choices were made by the director, Masaki Kobayashi, who has always been interested in the anti-establishment of the world, samurai culture in particular. Everything becomes really tragic when Hanshiro's friend performs seppuku, or when his daughter and grandson die Meanwhile, Hanshiro blindly follows the samurai's code and falls into dogmatism. He assumes seppuku is something true and follows the rules no matter what. Some scenes may seem funny for a contemporary viewer; Kobayashi was trying to add a little humor. Tragedy, politics, drama, and comedy The film has it all. I would recommend watching this film to those who are stricken by Japanese samurai movies.",Hara-Kiri
138,ruiz_bolivar,Fantatsic,10,14 June 2014,"Karakiri is my favorite Japanese films. This film is full of excitement, suspense, and drama. What makes this film great is the way Masaki Kobayashi went about recording the film. For instance, Masaki Kobayashi had low camera angles, real weapons, and he recorded on real time. I felt, that was what made this film great. One of the things that I actually enjoy about this film is the way Masaki Kobayashi pitches hidden massages to this audience. He makes the audience question what they believe is actually right. He wants his audience to dig deeper and don't settle for what's being said or told. What I find most interesting is the development of Japanese films. Japanese films were relatively late in film making. Yet, they made amazing films in the late 1900s. Karakiri is one of them. This film is a must watch.",Hara-Kiri
139,henricproduction,An excellent story told ala samurai,10,17 June 2014,"The movie is about following the holy bushido code. A code every samurai must follow to preserve his dignity towards the clan and family. The main story follows a samurai who has lost everything, and wants to commit seppuku ( the honorable way for a samurai to commit suicide). The plot then takes a dramatic twist, when the samurai step after step reveals why he came there. He is there to prove a message, that people do not have to follow the bushido code blindly. The ""top samurais"" don't even have the courage to follow it themselves, so why should others do it? It brings up several questions of how we sometimes follow orders blindly without thinking. It makes us think that every code, every order, is all made up by humans like you and me. It can easily be related to how North Korea is treating their people in a communist society. We know for fact that they are following orders, but for what good reason? We can easily see that following the presidents order has left the North part of Korean, considerably more poverty struck than the South.We need rebels in out society. People that are not afraid to stand up for their sake and other people. Without them, we will never change and never prove our thoughts right.",Hara-Kiri
140,Junglist-london,Interesting work about history and problems of todays society.,7,10 June 2014,"""Harakiri"" or ""Sepukku"" is great piece of Japanese art, movie itself has amazing work of cinematographer, you have no doubt that each shot was taken in the right spot. Angles and scenes are just perfect. Of course fight scenes are not as much brutal as we would see in Kill- Bill or other movies where people use swords, but the fact that in this movie they used real swords its frightening.The main point of the main character to come and cut his belly is not just because of situation of his life but also to give honor for those who passed away before and also to point out the problem of dogmatic point of view of high ranked people which actually pointing some interesting thoughts about life in Japan at period of time when movie was made.If amazing cinematography and issues that viable today are not enough to make you watch this movie than just watch it to know what is it ""To be Ronin"" or who are samurais and what was the time of samurais when Japan was extremely distant. I'm not saying that this movie tell the truth about Japan before 1615 but at least it give you a very interesting option of how it could be.Might warn you that movie is pretty long and mostly based on dialogs and flash-backs so if you want sword massacre then watch Kill Bill.",Hara-Kiri
141,joeylohman,Excellent Samurai Film,9,16 June 2014,"Harakiri is an excellent film taking place at the beginning of the Tokugawa era, using both the art of storytelling and flashbacks to tell the story of a Ronin (unemployed samurai) named Hanshiro who is seeking a place to honorably commit Harakiri (The honorable way to commit suicide for a samurai that must be granted by a master). After his ""clan"" is destroyed he travels to the Iyi clan seeking homage. The unexpected turns in this film are extraordinary and make it some what humorous to viewers. The use of Stylization and realism during these flashbacks make them very believable yet unpredictable. I thought it was and excellent samurai film and would recommend anyone to see it.",Hara-Kiri
142,santiago_jose_ivan,Poetic and thought provoking,8,16 June 2014,"Harakiri shows a quintessential patriarchal society. Everything is set up by men, run by men, and shows consequences because of this system of living. Without a doubt it was a man who produced the dogmatic bushido code. Multiple times throughout the film you can see the flimsy construction of patriarchy. A lone ronin showed the power of one against a patriarchy, a system which has done him, his family and countless others wrong. These systems are supposed to provide security. They failed to do this as the lone ronin took the top knots from their top three samurai. In samurai culture this is the equivalent to having your head cut off. The film as a whole can be seen as an analogy to governments and patriarchal society.",Hara-Kiri
143,gmsilvana2012,Power and inflexibility,5,17 June 2014,"This film left me thinking on the irrationality of many that have power. When on a position of power, we are inclined to keep it, to maintain the status quo and avoid its loss, or the loss of the tradition that justified that same power. Saito 's irrational rigidity speaks not so much about his control over the situation and the profound trust and loyalty he has on the symbols of his daimyos and of the bushido code, but on the fear of it disappearing. It is only when we fear for that disappearance and for the uncertainty of the future to come that we cling as much to the past and to the promises we made on the past, even when this may lead us to the extreme of irrationality and even inhumanity. Harakiri illustrates what most go through when faced to confront their beliefs and to question the legitimacy of what we swear is the ideal or best way of living/thinking/behaving; a lesson that can be applied in any situation especially if it involves a decision that, as in the film, will affect a third person directly. His inflexibility made me see his character as rather weak and stubborn, rather than loyal and centered.",Hara-Kiri
144,faroukramli,Leaves you thinking,9,14 June 2014,"Harakiri is a amazing film supported by amazing cinematography, my favorite shot in the film was a fight scene that takes place in plain of weeds. the technique of story telling is just flawless. this film is told by a devastated Ronin whom is ready to preform Harakiri and pay honor to his family. he also tests the purity of the Iyi Clan, and ends up exposing corruption. His witty way of telling his story reinterprets leadership and honor. this film leaves you questioning how history is written and what it means to follow an honor code how far should it go till rules should be broken?",Hara-Kiri
145,jia_kehan,Harikiri,8,18 June 2014,"What can be defined a good movie? The movie Harakiri can be the great example. This is a movie with a serious theme means through this old, black and white movie, people can get to know the Japanese samurai history in the specific time period(1619-1630). This movie also can be considered as a historic documentary.According to the plot, it was pretty simple— a déclassé samurai whose daughter and grandchild were sick, the son in law had to go to Kageyu Saito's house to beg for some money by choosing harakiri in front of Saito's house. But Saito did not want to know the reason that forced son in law seppuku by using a bamboo katana. Then the samurai fought back, criticized ruthless rulers and exposed their hypocrisy. As a result, the authorities got angry, and the samurai was too weak to fought the group of the authority's followers, and end up with tragic death. In the end, the matter was covered up by the authority, and no one knows. In Masaki Kobayashi's movie ""Harakiri"", it contained two strictly parallel corresponding stories. From the structure, these two stories were divided into serval parts, and were orderly placed into the plot according to the rhythm and the progress of the story in order to create a rigorous form so that the movie would have a significant theatrical feature.For people, it is natural to love, to be loved, and to survive. There would no reason for people to questioning their love for their family, and sometimes, people would do anything to protect their family just like what Chijima Motome did, and it is hard for someone to despicable or judge him. Also, the true warrior is even though there is hopeless situation can still remain calm, and stick to their principles and dignity.",Hara-Kiri
146,sun_fengya,Harakiri,7,17 June 2014,"This is a very serious film! Harakiri can be a history of documentary , because it reflects the samurai decline; it also can combine with the background and reality in Japan in 1962, think of it is a criticism and political film, also can look it in a moral view, concluded that despicability is the passport for the despicable. But I think the film just want to express---to live, to love. The most important thing to do is to live, can you despicable Chijiwa Motome? He just wants to get money to save his wife and son, Harakiri is the worst way to get money, but he still to do that. People have no reason to love and to life, it is necessary to love and to be loved, do not need any reason. I f you love someone, you still to find the reason you love him or her, your love is already crumbling, do you like this ramshackle life?

147,iwalksmall,The Great & Gory,8,18 June 2014,"Masaki Kobayashi's ""Harakiri"" or ""Seppuku"" is filled with drama and suspense. Kobayashi decided to tell the story in a non-linear style with plenty of flashbacks. This allowed the viewer to remain on edge, filled with skepticism and anticipation throughout the film. This director has no limits. I don't think I have ever had such a reaction to blood and gore in a film as I did in Harakiri. It got me to my feet. I completely respect his decision to show those elements, as they were completely necessary. This choice commanded that the viewer recognize from the very beginning that this was not just a story of life and death but a tale with deeper meaning. Isolationism was the overall theme of this movie, and Kobayashi does a spectacular job of sticking to this. Whenever we see Hanshiro telling his story from the courtyard we are overwhelmed with this sense of isolation, an every man for himself type of feeling.Cinematically speaking, the choices made in this arena felt ironically inviting and apprehensive simultaneously. Kobayashi makes the choice to shoot the majority of the film at kneeling height or eye level, because that is where the majority of people remained throughout the entire film. It is really one of those films that leaves you questioning, which makes sense as the director was prominently known for questioning all things Japanese.",Hara-Kiri

The stunning and crisp black and white cinema from the director Masaki Kobayashi showcases the theme of the film and of the samurai with the discipline and orderliness displayed throughout the film. However, there is much more behind the curtain of the so-called samurai. Tsugumo Hanshirō, the hero, or maybe even consider an anti-hero, has a mission to commit harakiri because he has become a shogun and would like an honorable death. The mission at hand isn't really the one the audience or Iyi Clan thought it to be.

It takes place in a time where thousand of Samurai where out of work and thrown into poverty. It was very interesting to see another cultures perspective on honor and loyalty. I felt bad for the ronins that where poor and had no way to survive. Harakiri is a ritualistic suicide for Samurai in Ancient Japan. This is an honorable ritual. The film tends to jumps around in different points of view throughout the storyline, so make sure you pay attention. What I took away from this movie is that sometimes the traditional ways of respecting authority must be questioned, especially when it comes down to what you believe to be right or wrong.",Hara-Kiri
151,morgan-sawyer-438,Holy Top Knots,10,17 June 2014,"Where has this film been my whole life?! This incredible tale shows the life of an unemployed Samurai in an impoverished sector of Japan. The Bushido code is challenged, and the true morale code and way of Samurai life is challenged to the core. I was told that I would never forget my first time witnessing an act of Seppuku, when one commits Harakiri by disemboweling themselves with their samurai sword. So far, I haven't. The black and white film technology available at the time of this movies production is a crime against humanity. How I would have loved to seen the rich red colors of the samurai armor, and to visually see the lush green trees in the Iyi Clan courtyard, or the saged yellow grass starving for the suns rays or a drop of water during Hanshiro's duel with the master swordsman. The film is a work of art, and should be treated as such. Sightly harsh and startling audio coupled with dark images and a haunting story line make this film probably something you shouldn't watch alone in the dark.",Hara-Kiri

However the main character, Hanshiro, gets to tell his full story of how and why he got there to the Iyi Clan. There is suspicion from the beginning when he is asked if he really ants to perform harakiri or if he simply wants money or a job. The counselor asks him this and Hanshiro replies the same answer that his son in law, Motome, did when he came in search for an open hand. Through Hanshiro's story telling, we are able to see the true meaning for why he is there; revenge for his lost family. Althpugh his intention is not on killing them, he simply wants them to acknowledge the unethical way they went about with Motome. In the beginning of them movie, the Iyi Clan armor is depicted as honorable, brave and even a little frightening however after the plot uncovers how the samurai retainers acted, the armor becomes an insignificant and worthless statue.",Hara-Kiri
153,blake-wands,"Well Written, Great Film",9,18 June 2014,"Harakiri is a masterfully constructed period drama by director Masaki Kobayashi. The film is expertly set up and provides the viewer with a thought provoking, entertaining two hours of both brilliant dialogue and suspenseful action. The film starts with the protagonist of the story, Tsugumo Hanshiro (Tatsuya Nakadai), as an out of work Samurai requesting to commit Harakiri (Seppuku) because he feels he wants to end his life honorably instead of poor and hungry. The counselor of the clan tells Hanshiro a story similar to what is happening now and the other samurai's grisly fate to deter him, but Hanshiro remains committed to his cause. The film is told through a series of stories, using flashbacks and narration to move the story along. Kobayashi effectively used the flashbacks and allows the viewer to easily follow the story line while jumping between different stories and timelines. While the acting of Hanshiro and the Counselor is of a higher tier than most, some of the supporting actors fall flat and leave much to be desired. For example, in the film, when Hanshiro is telling a story of his daughter and her husband, the characters end up being a little flat and not living up to their full potential. Their acting wasn't pivotal in the advancement of the story so it didn't deter the viewer's enjoyment of the film.Overall this film was deep and the viewer realized that both the protagonist and antagonist both have their own motivations. I found myself thinking about this film and the messages it conveyed long after I finished watching it. There are parallels that can be drawn with current events and even could cause you to reassess your own moral code. I highly recommend this well-written film.",Hara-Kiri

The film is about a ronin which is an ex samurai however, because he is no longer successful and has no family left, he wants to commit seppuku which is the art of cutting in the gut. However, the way the film is structure the viewer sees what he has experience and how his experiences led up to him making this decision. Something that is very interesting is the actor perform his own stunts. The films end in this very organized combat that was actually used with real weapons and everyone was highly train on how and when to throw the weapons and what direction so that it appears very real.

155,bnl1195,Hanshiro is a noble rebel!,8,18 June 2014,"Mizoguchi does an excellent job at creating a strong willed character that will stop at nothing to expose dogmatic followings of the Bushido code as unnecessary and unethical. I admire Mizoguchi for going against his cultures beliefs in order to showcase his own for others. So often we are quieted by what our religion, parents, culture, etc. expect of us; we are never able to claim our own identity and beliefs in fear of rejection. Hanshiro, who is against the dogmatic version of the Bushido code, is ironically the one samurai who embodies the noble side of it above anyone else. I feel here Mizoguchi was trying to deliver the message that following your own beliefs and ""orders"" is far more valuable than following others orders. Anyone can be a dogmatic follower only a few can think freely and passionately enough to be a counterforce to wrong acts that are seen as societal norms. You can definitely feel that Mizoguchi was influenced by the French New way in terms of how he decides to tell the story—it's not particularly in chronological order. Instead it is a story that is told through a past story (Motome's experience). By telling both of these stories you can further understand what fueled Hanshiro to be the admirable rebel that he is.",Hara-Kiri
156,ortiz-xiomara,Today's Good Sucker Punch from the Past,8,18 June 2014,"Soldier Masaki Kobayashi directed the Jedi-geki piece ""Harakiri"", which is about a man who is on the quest of committing sepuku (suicide), a respectable death in an honorable place for respectable Samurais. The movie starts out slow with the dialog, because the pace of the scenes and the actors are soothing on a monotone level (I understand that with the Samurais in a sacred place, that is part of their mannerism and culture). However, the more you watch the film, the pace starts to pick up as you listen to the story play on by (there are a series of flashbacks implemented into the scene). As you progress into the film, it turns out that the Samurai is looking for an honorable death, but he is also there to mock the code of the Bushido, and the unbalance that exists within the system that cost him his son in law's life in a horrid way, who he cared for as a son.Kobayashi takes us on a journey about how man, in a corrupted system, tends to either dehumanize us into walking robots, or giving us a choice to find balance in society. I though this was brilliant of him to put this film together, especially since he was a soldier himself, and got persecuted for similar parallel circumstances (not the suicide, but the system of ""doing your job"" in a military stance). Tatsuya Nakadai (who played Samurai Hanshiro Tsugumo) did a brilliant job and stole the show. There is a spiritual element in the film, but I suggest to watch the film and pay attention to the dialog, because this film will really make you think about our current society today.",Hara-Kiri
157,KaceyLeggio,"Revenge, Redefinition and Ritual",7,18 June 2014,"While ""Harakiri"" was not my first experience with Japanese history, culture or cinema, it was still an impacting and enlightening film. While ruthless in nature, ""Harakiri"" does a wonderful job in conveying the history of ancient Japan, samurais and the Bushido code. While some people's knowledge of samurais only extend as far as the Disney film, ""Mulan"", ""Harakiri"" sheds a great deal of light on the underlying meaning behind the truth, strength and honor of the code. With a protagonist that is both relentless and appealing, ""Harakiri"" delivers special performances all over the board. While it moves a bit slow, there is an undeniable enchantment about this film. The story, while heart-wrenching, is so well done that you come out of it rooting for more. It makes you question history and the way it's perceived, just as I'm sure Mr. Kobayashi intended. With engaging choreography and near-perfect consume and set design, ""Harakiri"" brings you to a place and time that you otherwise may not have known existed. Kobayashi does a wonderful job at conveying the internal struggle between all characters, men whom have an obligation to their families, and those who have one to their code. This film challenges all the elements of revenge, redefinition and ritual. A job very well done.",Hara-Kiri
158,cook_tyler_leslie,A Must See Samurai Film,8,18 June 2014,"Originally titled ""Seppuku,"" ""Harakiri"" is a 1962 Japanese film directed by Masaki Kobayashi. ""Harakiri"" is a narrative in nonlinear format, meaning that the order in which the film unfolds is not necessarily the order in which events transpired. I have no knowledge as to whether Tarantino has actually seen this film or cited as an influence, but it is easy to imagine this film as an influence of his, especially in relation to the nonlinear narrative, as well as the role Japanese cinema played on him.The protagonist of the film is Hanshiro, who is a ronin, or a samurai without a lord. The premise of the film is that Hanshiro travels to the house of the Ii clan, where he asks to perform seppuku, which is a type of suicide performed by samurai wherein the samurai disembowels himself with the intent of preserving his honor. The Ii clan's counselor, Saito, agrees to let Hanshiro perform seppuku. Saito tells Hanshiro of another ronin who came there wishing to perform seppuku before him. This is really where things get interesting. To preserve the viewing experience of readers who may not have seen the film yet, I will not delve into many details beyond the initial premise discussed above.""Harakiri"" is a film I would highly recommend. Essentially, the real message of the film is focused on the consequences of blinding following code or rules and the effect that that type of dogmatism can have. This is a film that will stick with you long after the initial viewing, so be prepared to question any beliefs you may hold afterwards.",Hara-Kiri

160,WaveTossed,A classic!,10,28 June 2005,"A classic, surviving the test of time -- made in 1962 about 17th century people. Here in 2005, we still watch and discuss the film and the issues that it raises. Tsugumo Hanshiro, a middle-aged ronin formerly serving a clan abolished by the Shogunate, appears at the Ii clan gate. He wishes to commit seppuku rather than live on in poverty. In his inner headquarters, Saito Kageyu, the chief retainer, bemoans the fact that hordes of starving ronin have been making similar requests at clan gates; most have wanted handouts rather than to actually commit seppuku. Kageyu suspects the same of Hanshiro. Kageyu attempts to discourage Hanshiro. He tells a tale of another ronin from the same abolished clan, Chijiiwa Motome. Motome had appeared a few months earlier, with a request, but had carried bamboo sword blades  the clan members had been enraged. As an example to other scrounging ronin, particularly those without real blades, the clan decided to force Motome to commit seppuku with his own bamboo wakizashi. Hanshiro tells his own life story. The film shows us some historical background. Thousands of ex-retainers had been thrown out of their positions, made into ronin, by the Shogunate's abolishing of clans. In the rigid class system (samurai, farmers, artisans, merchants), these displaced ex-retainers had no place at all, being forced into marginal subsistence. Most trades (because they required long periods of apprenticeship) were out for most ronin. Many ronin became outlaws or obtained bodyguard positions for gangsters. If law-abiding, they were able to teach in schools for commoner children. Or become piecework artisans; they could contract with wholesalers (who also lent money) to make fans, umbrellas, insect cages, ink brushes, and the like. Even as most ronin had to fend for themselves in this netherworld, they still were to carry the two swords of their original rank, and to uphold their obligations. Hanshiro and his daughter Miho make umbrellas and fans to sell to wholesalers for a pittance; Hanshiro is in debt to one of the wholesalers. Motome teaches commoner children and receives a minimal wage for his work. Miho and Motome marry and have a son. All goes well until sickness strikes. Miho contracts consumption and the child contracts a fever. Neither Hanshiro nor Motome can afford a doctor. Motome attempts to get a laborer job (which pays more than teaching does) and runs straight into job discrimination: ""no starving ronin need apply."" Motome sells his sword blades at a pawnshop, obtaining bamboo blades to wear inside his sword fittings, not an uncommon practice; some ronin (and some low-ranked clan samurai) desperately needed money. And yet, the sword was considered to be ""the soul of the bushi."" A bushi who sold his blades had to appear to wear the badge of his rank. The bamboo blades were available, thus no one would know of the despicable act of having sold his ""soul"" for money.But Motome has not received enough; he still cannot afford a doctor. So Motome decides on something more desperate: to appear at a clan gate, with his hidden bamboo blades, in order to request seppuku -- with the actual intention of receiving a handout to get a doctor for his wife and child. The Ii clan officials have decided differently. The scene where Motome must commit seppuku with his bamboo wakizashi is one of the most harrowing scenes ever filmed. Motome is utterly humiliated, surrounded by the Ii clan retainers, with Onodaka Hikokuro, his assigned second preaching on how the sword is the soul of the samurai, the bamboo sword is what is appropriate for Motome, and so forth. While Motome painfully carries forth. Hikokuro refuses Motome's request to cut off his head and end the ritual's mockery, so Motome ends it himself, biting off his tongue. Hanshiro has realized -- too late -- that he had never dared to even consider selling his own sword blades to help out the family. The scene when he is confronted with Motome's body and the truth of what has happened is truly gut-wrenching, as Hanshiro weeps and slams down his ""useless tokens"" that he had clung to. Hanshiro reveals his own secret  he has used his ""useless tokens"" to avenge Motome's death. He has tracked down the three Ii retainers who were most responsible for Motome's death. The final duel between Hanshiro and Onodaka Hikokuro is absolutely stunning. Instead of taking the lives of these three, Hanshiro has taken their topknots. And while Kageyu has preached to Hanshiro about samurai honor, these three swordsmen have hidden themselves away, claiming sickness to cover up their own shame, while their topknots grow back. Kageyu cannot deal with Hanshiro's revelations. He commands his men to slaughter Hanshiro. Hanshiro fights back gamely, taking four of the Ii clan retainers and wounding several more. In a symbolic scene, he tears down the ancestral armor of the Ii clan. Some Ii clansmen use their rifles against Hanshiro, but Hanshiro sticks his own sword into his belly, committing seppuku as he has pledged to do. In the end, Kageyu fashions a cover-up of the entire event; mysterious plagues have hit the Ii clan and a number of their retainers, including Onodaka, have died of ""illness"" rather than by the blade of an impoverished hungry ronin. This film raises many issues. It is Kobayashi's impassioned protest against rigidly militaristic societies that uphold hypocritical codes of ""bushido"" while disdaining what that term really means. The film is also like a Greek tragedy, with a character (Tsugumo Hanshiro) possessing the tragic flaw of his own pride -- which in the end, he must pay for with his life. Which he does in a heroic way. This film doesn't just recount the oppression of poor people. It shows the strength that these poor people have, the choices that they make as individuals, refusing to just bow down and be mere victims of their society.",Hara-Kiri
161,RealReelFan,Not your usual Samurai movie,7,16 February 2014,"Hanshiro Tsugumo, a destitute, out of work Samurai, presents himself at the home of his feudal lord and asks permission to use the elegant courtyard to perform ritual suicide, or Harakiri, thereby assuring himself an honorable death. But the Counselor who considers his request is suspicious of Hanshiro's motives, thinking the Samurai might simply be preying on his sympathies in the hopes of securing employment or being paid off and sent away. It turns out the Counselor is right to be suspicious, but very wrong about Hanshiro's motives.This movie is about the Samurai, but there aren't any elaborate battle scenes with flashing swords and bloody deaths (there is one difficult death scene). Harakiri is a mystery, almost a thriller, an intricately woven, ticking time bomb of a film. Tatsuya Nakadai (a highly respected Japanese actor) plays Hanshiro with an understated swagger, intimidating in spite of his impoverished state, but when the camera lingers on his face, we can see heartbreak in his eyes – a deep pain that has led him to question the nobility of the Samurai code.Beautifully shot in black and white, wonderfully acted, altogether a great story told by a great filmmaker (director Masaki Kobayashi).

Harrakiri was slow-paced and slightly confusing in the beginning, but that was the beauty of it. As soon as I put the missing pieces together, I felt fully-connected to each character. There was such complexity and tension throughout the film, it was almost nauseating. In the beginning, we are shown the symbol of the Iyi clan- an empty suit of armor that embodies power and integrity; the essence of grandeur. It is Hanshiro's storytelling throughout the film that shows how counselor Saito of the Iyi Clan is completely dehumanized beyond reason. Counselor Saito refuses to have the clan exploited for money or clothes so he tells the tale of a ronin named Motome and his attempt to commit harrakiri with a bamboo sword. Hanshiro tells his side of the story: The heart-breaking story of Motome who did not have enough money to help his dying wife Miho and son Kingo. Counselor Saito knew he took it too far but he refused to acknowledge that he did anything wrong; he was simply following the code(the code is greater than life itself). Acknowledgement of such a thing could cause complete chaos and would make others question the validity of the bushido code and the Iyi Clan.

This is one of the most dishonoring consequences that can happen to a Samurai, and according to tradition, seppuku should be committed. However, this does not occur and this demonstrates the hypocrisy of powerful individuals in said culture.

168,KThompson888-374-590752,"Hara-kiri is a film about facades, adherence to rules and, above all, about the true meaning of honor.",10,12 February 2014,"The pacing of Hara-kiri is slower and more contemplative than most films made in the West, but the build up pays off like a punch to the gut when things are revealed to us. The story is lean despite its 132 minute running time. There are no subplots not directly related to the story, which charges forward to its conclusion without distraction, never veering from its path. The most honorable character in Hara-kiri turns out to be Motome Chijiwa, who spends most of the film being portrayed as a coward, a liar, and a cheat for pretending to want to commit hara-kiri. A reversal of roles (or, more accurately, a reversal in our perceptions) occurs as we slowly discover that Motome did what he did in an effort to make money to support his ill and impoverished family. His character and motives do not change throughout the story, but our perceptions of him change from that of a coward, to that of a brave hero. The decision of Motome to sell the blades of his swords to support his family (which means grave dishonor for a samurai) turns out to be honorable. In light of this, Hanshiro's insistence on not selling his blades in spite of his family's suffering, illness, and subsequent death seems cowardly and foolish.The structure of Hara-kiri intercuts back and fourth between the past (Motome's hara-kiri) and the present (Hanshiro's hara-kiri). At first, the two stories seem completely unrelated (other than that they both involve Ronin requesting to commit hara-kiri). As the two stories progress, we learn that the two men not only knew each other, but were related by marriage. We finally learn that Hanshiro is there to restore honor to the memory of Motome, and to show the Iyi clan the error of their ways.Hanshiro tells the Iyi samurai not to be so quick to judge others, for they may soon be faced with the same fate. This could not be more true. They are also samurai, just like the struggling ronin who showed up at their door to perform hara-kiri. At any time, their house could fall, just as the others did, and then they themselves would become wandering ronin, struggling to survive and to support their families. Hanshiro tells them, ""How can those who never wanted for food or clothing understand (the ronin's) misery?""We cannot pass judgment on the antagonists without also seeing the snap judgments that we ourselves make. In this sense, Hara-kiri holds up a mirror to it's audience. We never know someone's full story and reasons for doing something, and therefore, are in no place to make judgments about their character. Hanshiro says to the Iyi clan samurai, ""Let them laugh all they want. Who can fathom the depths of another man's heart?""""After all, this thing we call samurai honor is ultimately nothing but a façade."" Samurai ""honor"" is merely pageantry. Motome set an example for real, genuine honor. The samurai genuinely believe that they are doing the right thing as they desperately cling to their written code of honor. They are blinded and bound by their own strict set of rules (the Bushido code).I feel conflicted about Saito. Yes, he shows much more humanity than Hikokuro's strict and ruthless adherence to dogma, but Saito sees, on some level, that this is wrong. Yet he is in charge of the Iyi clan and still refuses to stop it (although he is the one in the position to do so). Yes, it would create a stir, but I think it makes him the most despicable character: the one who sees something is wrong, and has the power to stop it, yet does nothing about it.At the end, Hanshiro breaks the armor statute (which represents the samurai rules, doctrine, and façade) and then commits hara-kiri before being shot with a gun by the Iyi samurai (they could not defeat him with a sword, ten against one).The final shots of the film include the leitmotif of the journal. In the beginning, it is simply the act of creating a record; at the end, it is the proliferation of lies which survives. The written historical account is falsified to preserve the façade of honor, and to (at least temporarily) keep the Iyi clan in power.",Hara-Kiri

Director Masaki Kobayashi leaves audiences questioning what was more important; for a man to stand for his own pride, or leave pride behind to stand for his loved ones.Being born and raised in Japan myself, after watching this film I was left thinking deeply about the true meaning of honor. At first glance, Motome Chijiiwa seems like a coward, lying to the Iyi clan asking to commit Seppuku as an attempt to get money to be asked to leave. However, through Hanshiro's story-telling, we find out that Motome was only committing such actions to pay for a doctor to save his sick family. In my opinion, I think Motome's actions are justified and he can be considered an honorable Samurai. Fighting for the lives of others is more honorable than fighting for one's own pride. In the end, the Iyi clan members who took pride in and lived by the Bushido code so much were the ones that tarnished the code themselves. In the beginning of the film, an Iyi clan red armor is shown as a representation of an honorable and glorious spirit. In the end, the same armor is shown. However, this time it seems empty, as if there was nothing for the Iyi clan to stand for anymore.I give this film a 7 out of 10 because of the unique way the story unfolds, as well as the topic that had me thinking for days.",Hara-Kiri
171,jasongelfat,Harakiri: Lessons on how NOT to act as leader.,7,12 February 2014,"""Harakiri"" is a sophisticated film that critiques the Samurai of the Tokugawa era around 1630. The order in which this story is told is crucially important to the way the viewer perceives each character on an individual basis. Although the film starts with a Ronin desiring to commit Harakiri, known as Hanshiro, it quickly turns into a flashback when counselor Saito tells the story of a man named Motome Chijiwa. The story reveals how Motome dies, but is irrelevant until Hanshiro tells his life story just before he is about to commit Harakiri. After hearing Hanshiro's detailed story, the camera angles and placement begin to play a key role in the message behind this film. Not only does it become clear that Hanshiro is at the Iyi temple with a hidden agenda, but we also start to see close up shots of Saito who is becoming deeply affected by the story being told. It sparks a possibility that maybe Saito will understand that he made a poor decision in having Motome killed, and that he should apologize to Hanshiro. On the contrary, Saito not only doesn't apologize, but he calls for an even harsher punishment on Hanshiro, thinking that he was some kind of crazy psychopath. Listening to Hanshiro's story, it made sense as to why Hanshiro was so angry, considering he may have only wanted to hear Saito admit he made a mistake. Saito is so caught up in his role as a counselor and Samurai master that he is evidently incapable of publicly expressing feelings of human emotion. This demonstrates how easily humans tend to abuse power, and how Saito cannot give in to Hanshiro's story that clearly points out Saito's mistake.""Harakiri"" is not just about the life of Samurai, but also the levels extremity in which they abide by the Boshido code. It's an interesting paradox how these samurai in the Iyi temple are so quick to judge the two Ronin who walk into their temple, yet as a viewer we tend to catch ourselves doing the same thing. There is a wide range of samurais in this film, some who are extremely dogmatic towards the Boshido code, and others who maneuver their way around it. Director Kobayashi cleverly points out the idea of humanism in cinema as it becomes the contrast to the Boshido code. Humanism shows how humans are what really matter most, and he demonstrates this, for example, with the character Hikokuro. This extremely dogmatic samurai has his hairpiece cut off in a battle with Hanshiro, which for samurai is worse than death itself, yet, Hikokuro still waits a few days before he commits Harakiri. Why? Well it raises the notion that pure and absolute dogma is a double standard in our society and is not possible for humanity. This film focuses on the significance of how history takes place in our world and how power is ultimately the factor that determines our fate. In ""Harakiri"" it was the role of Saito's power that created the entire plot and storyline for this film, and ends with a sense of ambiguity towards the significance of the samurai. This derived from witnessing the armor in the beginning with a striking and powerful presence, almost as if it were a spiritual god, and then seeing how in the end it is torn apart and put back together, as if it were something so insignificant as hanging a picture back on the wall. The metaphor of the janitors cleaning up after the battle leading to Hanshiro's death is such a large metaphor for the samurai culture and how so much can occur within their temples and how seemingly unimportant it tends to feel after the fact. Although the film has a dramatic plot, it is the critique on powerful people in society that transforms this film into a something more than your typical samurai battle movie.",Hara-Kiri

174,pandayew-921-531899,Tradition vs. Humanism: the revaluation of dogmas,9,12 February 2014,"Tradition vs. Humanism: the revaluation of dogmas and inevitability of progress Having participated in kendo, the art of Japanese swordsmanship, for a good decade, I am somewhat familiar with the importance of tradition and discipline within the samurai culture. Of course, the tradition has lessened in it's severity overtime, but we still respect and remember it's importance and time and place in the culture. Watching the movie ""Harakiri"" I couldn't help but question the dogmatism of the men of the Iyi clan. In the beginning of the movie I felt slightly delightful that Motome was being teased and tortured. I judged him without even thinking about his situation. Later, finding out more details of his personal life, I felt sorry and guilty for feeling almost enjoyment for his forced suicide. Passing judgment on Motome without even knowing or trying to know what he went through shows the audience that, we as a people, it is in our nature to take the point of view of those who are telling the story. This also makes a statement on how the history we know might not be true. It could be biased by the people who wrote it. This is proved at the end where Counselor Saito rewrites the history and covers up the incidents that occurred within the Iyi house. Professor and Director Salvador Carrasco states that, ""Meta history is what we get. We were privy to what happened even though Saito fabricates the history at the end."" Knowing that, how can we judge or even believe the facts of history that we know now?The discipline of the followers of the Bushido code shows how sometimes, exceptions of the code should be made for the greater good. Take Motome for example: he was a respected samurai but had to resort to selling his pride as one to save his family. If the Iyi clan had the decency, the humanism to respect Motome's request or even ask him why, things might have been different. But because of their headstrong attitude and pride to follow the code, Motome and his family are inevitably doomed. Through their dogmatic attitude and self-righteousness, they lacked humanism. It is in our human nature to become greedy, pompous, and abusive when we have power. When the three retainers of the Iyi clan call in sick for having had their top buns cut off, it shows that when power is taken away, so is their self-righteousness and pride.Also, In the beginning of the film, a contrasted shogun armor is shown. It represented power and something bigger but towards the end, it represented something else. Seeing the corruption and abuse of power, the fabrication of history, I can't help but see a meaningless, empty shell of a tradition that used to mean so much more. Overall, the human condition is constantly being questioned throughout the film. With it's print-like composition and symmetrical settings clean shots and simplicity,, the solemnity and seriousness of the film is exemplified.",Hara-Kiri
175,misskris2222,A must see!,9,12 February 2014,"Harakiri is the first Japanese film I have seen and it is definitely not for the lazy. Be ready to read subtitles at the speed of light and pay attention because if you don't you run the risk of missing out on a whole lot of plot and information. The film starts out slow, following a ronin and his family as they struggle through hard times that include unemployment, sickness, loss and a little bit of love and selflessness to even everything out. At times it can be a little confusing but if you pay attention to the characters you'll have no problem putting together all the pieces of the puzzle. The theme of this movie is relatable across every culture. You feel for the characters and the situation they are in and when you find out that the family has sold everything of value they own, even the blades of Motome's swords, your heart aches for them because you know it still isn't enough. And finally for a nice spin at the end, history is rewritten and it will leave you questioning everything you've been told. An all around amazing story that is definitely worth watching.",Hara-Kiri
176,nataliejulia02,Harakiri,10,11 February 2014,"I had never seen a Japanese film before I saw Harakiri. For an introduction to Japanese cinema, I was greatly impressed by Kobayashi's accomplishment in making this complex film look effortlessly simple. At first, I thought that this film would be a typical period piece just set in Japan but that was an ignorant assumption that I made. The film follows the story of two ronins (samurai), Motome and Hanshiro, during the Tokugawa era. They each, at separate times, ask to commit harakiri (suicide) at the Iyi clan house with similar background stories. Half way through the film, the story comes around that these two ronins are related. The film's plot not only symbolizes the end of the samurai way of life, but also presents a greater meaning of humanism vs dogmatism and the corruptive nature of power. The film makes us, the audience, aware of our own humanistic, dogmatic and corrupt traits by following Hanshiro's explanation to who he is and who Motome was. Although at first, we see Motome come to the Iyi clan to commit harakiri, we also see that he does everything in his power to save his family and what his intentions were originally, making him the most honorable of samurai. The Iyi clan persecute him due to regime than considering the reasoning for his suicide. The clan represents the dogmatic samurai that think with their heads rather than their hearts. This shows the corruptive nature of power and stagnation. The film brings to attention our own ignorant assumptions that make us draw parallels between our moral code and that of the samurai code. Stylistically it is beautifully composed with balance and precision. The plot is perfectly complex yet easily understood, reflecting Japanese tradition, as not to obscure the meaning. Every scene has a deep significance and every element has a symbolic value that truly makes this film one of the best I have ever seen.",Hara-Kiri
177,cenclaiborne17,Concept of perception and loyalty,7,11 February 2014,"Harakiri dives into many different themes such as perception, judgement, and loyalty. When the story of Motome is told the viewer begins pass judgement onto him and his motives. Later on we find out that his motives are essentially pure. Considering the deeper themes of the movie we see in the end a metaphor for what happens when humanism comes second to loyalty to a code. The film uses one of the most creative forms of story telling to convey a complex and deep message. The complexity of the plot adds a deep element of surprise that provokes thought. Kobayashi uses characters to represent extremes of personalities as well institutions. The film falls short many times in keeping the audiences attention, and misses out on many opportunities to capitalize on the sudden shifts in plot and tone. This consistent variable makes the film a very long winded two hours. By the end of the film you might feel as though your mind was subjected to something far more exhausting than watching a film. If you manage to power through many forced emotions from the actors and over dramatic timing than you can actually begin to appreciate the deeper themes conveyed through the story telling of the film. Kobayashi masterfully crafted scenarios in the film that made you like many of the other characters within it, because neither of you know the whole truth until you are hit with it. This film goes through great lengths humanize certain characters while limiting itself in passing judgement on others. You begin to learn that when everyone follows a certain philosophy the difference in perspective and interpretation can mean everything. Over all this film uses many different clever tactics to add depth to action and entertaining gore. Although much of the pacing of the film and cinematography leave something to be desired this is still an extremely well executed and intelligent film.",Hara-Kiri
178,sandrarahimpour,Not like the other ones,10,12 February 2014,"Most films that I have watched are not as action packed as this movie here; Hara Kiri. Coming from a Japanese background, my family and I would always discuss about the Japanese history and events in the past. So by watching this movie for the first time in my film studies class, my reaction to this movie was in utter shock. I was very impressed on how Masaki Kabayashi directed this film. To me, it made me feel like I was actually in the movie. I also liked how director Kabayashi used a tatami shot in some scenes. This film taught me a lot about Japanese history. The structural traits that I noticed in this movie were its central theme; focus on one main theme, quest for harmony (balance of things); quest done by symmetry, parallelism, and contrast. Overall I give this movie a two thumbs up.",Hara-Kiri
179,talldude21192,It simply has everything,10,11 February 2014,"This is just a movie about the kind of guy everyone wishes they were. A man of honor with nothing to lose, carrying out justice. Probably almost half of the movie is flashbacks or a story in a story, but when it's pulled off, it's just the most intriguing thing to watch. It's easy to jump to conclusions in this movie, but it's like your whole impression of a character changes every 20 minutes. It's unimaginable as to how much controversy this film caused in Japan, especially coming from a Japanese filmmaker, but it really makes you think about the samurai culture and their position in society. It's truly one of the greatest examples of exploring humanism there is. Every character, even the protagonist, have their flaws that probably cost them a lot, but you're not left not understanding any character. You really can see the story from everyone's very different perspectives. It explores ideas that society never really stops to think about, like when is compassion more important than pride, or how literally should you really take things, and when do you really start abusing power. It doesn't force a message or moral on its audience, but just makes you stop to think about them, and show you what can happen when you take one side of it. You can watch this movie looking for every detailed meaning in it, or just watch it because it's a guy with nothing to lose and a lot of skills, going out for justice. Either way it's great and really a true example of what Japanese culture has brought to filmmaking.",Hara-Kiri
180,Diazz1994,Do not hurry to judge...,9,11 February 2014,"Do not Hurry up to judgeAfter the civil wars in Japan a lot of samurais lost their jobs and became ronins. Some ronins travleled across Japan looking for jobs and others decided to commit harakiri (when a samurai kills himself with his own sword)Hanshiro, a ronin, comes to the Iyi house and asks to commit sepuku. The counselor tells him a story about a ronin Motome that lied that he wanted to commit sepuku. He was caught and forced not only to commit it, but to do it with his bamboo sword. Hanshiro listens to the story and insists that his intentions are true. The ceremony begins and Hanshiro tells the other side of Motome's story...The movie is incredible! It holds your attention from the beginning to the very end. I loved the way Masaki Kobayashi makes the viewers totally change their opinions about the characters throughout the movie. For example, at first I didn't sympathize Motome. I thought he was a liar, a quitter and he didn't deserve to be a samurai (and so did the Iyi house), but when Hanshiro tells Motome's story I felt the opposite. I thought what a brave man, how much he loved his family, he even sold his sword (which is extremely important for a samurai; ""a sword is a samurai's soul""; and it is very important detail that Hanshiro didn't even think about selling his sword and he really regrets that).I loved how Kobayashi shows Hanshiro's revenge not buy killing those three samurai's, but buy embarrassing them, buy cutting off their topknots (for a samurai loosing his topknot in a battle is worse than death).The two characters that are very important in the movie are the counselor and Hikokuro. Hikokuro is this true, dogmatic samurai that implicitly follows the rules of the Bushido code (which in the end is actually a book of lies). He is tough, strong and disciplined. A lot of viewers thought that he was sadistic, because of the harakiri scene, but I don't think so. He was a real samurai, that believed and followed every word in the Bushido code, and he considered people who disobeyed the code disgusting and weak. That's why he hated Motome and that's why he respected Hanshiro. Saito, the counselor, is another strong character in ""Harakiri"". He is the opposite of Hikokuro. He is a samurai, but first of all he is a humanist. He definitely understands what Hanshiro was saying, and I'm sure he felt sorry for him and his family, and I think he really regrets what they did to Motome, but at the same time he is a counselor. He is the head, the leader of the Iyi house, and if he brakes down, than the whole house will go down. That is why he ordered to kill Hanshiro, he needed to protect the honor of the Iyi house.It is very important to watch the harakiri scene (yes, girls, it's pretty graphic, but try to do it). I loved the way Kobayashi contrasts the reactions of Hikokuro, that is angry and doesn't feel any sympathy watching Motome suffer, he didn't even strike of his head, he was waiting for Motome to finish the harakiri cross; and the counselor, who is absolutely shocked and terrified, but doesn't say a word, because he can't, he has to prove that everyone will be treated like this ""you come to commit harakiri, we will make sure you do it"".My favourite scene is when the counselor makes up a story that will be the official record of what happened. Kobayashi really showed that this book, these ideal rules for samurai's are simply nothing, just a bunch of lies. It's all about appearance, and in fact it's all useless, it's just the illusion of perfection. It really made me question a lot about our lives and especially our history. How many ""official"" records like these do we have? And are the rules and appearances really worth it, or it's all just an illusion of perfection?",Hara-Kiri
181,westonsegal,The underlining meaning,8,11 February 2014,Harakiri is an example of expansion into the depths ones self and beliefs. It makes a statement that opens up the the possibility to question what is the truth and what is made to look like the truth. A true tale that dives into the minds of men and their actions that define history. Harakiri also shows the beliefs of the samurai and the double standards they put upon people and the true hypocrisy of those in power and how they are abel to alter and manipulate events to their own accord. It is also the journey of one man's attempts for revenge and to redeem the honor of his family and to bring the unjust treatment of his family into the light. It is a movie that leaves you with the feeling of bewlilderment and the felling to question and wonder what rally is the truth and what is the fiction that people want us to believe.,Hara-Kiri
182,porprerock,The best Japanese movie I have seen.,10,12 February 2014,"Hara-Kiri film confused me but it was all clear in the half of it. Its one of those films that the viewer has to pay close attention starting from the beginning to end. Hara-Kiri is about the life of a true Samurai. Its suspense, action, love and revenge in a way. In the first minutes of the film I saw it as if it was about two men going to the Iyi Clan in the same day to ask for help but it was clear when the main character is the one telling the story of the other guy. That was a big twist. The director Kobayashi did a unique style in which tricks the mind for the viewer to think this way. It also shows the humanity in each character in their expressions and thoughts. At the end this film said to me to not judge someone look and to do whats feels right and not what a rule said, meaning of who is really a real human. Emotionally it affected me when the wife cries for her husband because of a pass experience. Then when the main character fights with the Samurais, I wanted him to take revenge towards all but it does not happen. Its another film in which makes you question the history of a country.",Hara-Kiri
183,urieljimenez_93,Respect to ancestors.,10,12 February 2014,"In my point of view Hara-kiri was a tremendous movie where surrealism was well perform, where I was able to experiment the feeling of being there because of the good engagement between the Camera conflict of angles (high and low). However, the way Hara-kiri was perform it lead to cruelty and brutal for me. Motome, Hanshiro and the rest of samurai that live in Iyi clan followed the Bushido code which was pure, unique because it was their religion and believes. Also for those who were decided in heart to committed Hara-kiri, they believe it was an honor to die this way. In other hand, I choose to talk about Motome because the scene where he committed Hara-kiri was the most that make me believe on what was happening and the reason why they were doing those kind of rituals. This scene was so pragmatic, it even make me feel the pain Motomo was going trough till the end of his death",Hara-Kiri
184,luigiarellano328,Kobayashi's Great Message and Style,10,11 February 2014,"Harakiri put in perspective on how most of our world works on knowing and telling the truth. How in society some will have a dogmatic view on certain laws that leave no room for a humanistic approach. This movie has also shown me that maybe not everyone, history or in the present, is not who they seem. There were good samurai out there who really were respectful and honorable and ones who weren't. That there is no shame in putting your dignity on the line for the people you love and protect. It made me feel as though there is still hope for a conscious/humanistic way of doing things, and that maybe there is still a chance as a society to behave as such. As a bonus I really loved the samurai duals because there was something respectful and honorable about them. The movie itself was great none the less.",Hara-Kiri
185,mrja127,A Quick Look Into Dogmatic Interpretation of the Bushido Code,10,11 February 2014,"This movie is absolutely amazing. This film gives us insight to the Tokugawa Era of Japan in a very interesting way. Masaki Kobayashi tells an amazing tale of the plight between maintaining samurai ideals and humanistic ethics, we see this through the literal interpretation of the samurai code (the Bushido code) throughout the movie. What really stuck out to me was how hell bent Hikokuro was to make Motome commit seppuku without the grace period, no one cared to hear the back story to understand why Motome needed this period, and when Hanshiro was able to articulate the story to Saito (the counselor) although Saito seemed to be very impacted by the story, he had to uphold the ideals of the Bushido Code even if it meant the harsh self- mutilation of Motome with the bamboo swords.Not only was Hikokuro hell bent on making Motome commit seppuku, but he made sure Motome used the bamboo swords. Hikokuro fills in as Motome's second (to deliver the final blow) but when Motome does not do a ""good enough"" job Hikokuro refuses to deliver the final blow, so Motome must bite his tongue off to kill himself. This is in all ways the most dogmatic interpretation of the Bushido code because he wants everything to do be done the ""samurai way"" when in fact he does not.Hikokuro is a great example of a double standard in this movie, he forces Motome to commit seppuku with the bamboo swords, but when it comes to his topknot getting cut off he postpones his own seppuku because he does not want to die quite yet.Lastly we see the Bushido code upheld with such divinity towards the end. Hanshiro kills some of the people at the mansion because he is ordered to be killed and when it comes to writing the account of their deaths, Saito says to say that they died of sickness to not tarnish the Bushido code.Overall this movie was very well made and i really enjoyed watching it. This movie gives us two very different ideas of the character Motome (from scum to honorable) in the beginning and end, which i think is an example of Kobayashi's film genius.",Hara-Kiri
186,prins_terry_john,An Instant Classic,9,11 February 2014,"""Harakiri"" is a revolutionary Kobayashi masterpiece set in the early days of the Tokugawa Era, when Japan experienced a time of relative peace and Samurai and Ronin alike felt a new wave of challenges that start off the battlefield. The story follows a particular Ronin (or ""Unemployed Samurai""), named ""Motome"", as he requests to commit Harakiri or ""Seppuku"", a Japanese form ritual suicide, in the valorous House of Iyi. Kobayashi demonstrates his creative power and pure ingenuity in Harakiri as the story unfolds and he raises questions about honor, the Bushido code, the human condition, Samurai, the concept of power and how it affects those who wield it, and Japan's own identity as it emerges from the ever changing world of the post World War II period. Unlike other films about Japan's past and the Samurai in mainstream cinema, Harakiri questions the views of the Samurai and how they may have acted throughout history. For example, although ""The Last Samurai"" was well received in Japan, some viewers such as Tomomi Katsuta felt its honorable portrayal of the Samurai was incompatible with contemporary views, and that Japanese views of the Samurai are different, stating ""Our image of Samurai is that they were more corrupt."" For example, Samurai were permitted to kill common folk on site if they so much as gave them a dirty or disrespectful look. ""Harakiri"" does away with the fairy tale portrayals of Samurai that we often see, reflecting more of who they were and how power can corrupt all.""Harakiri"" will not disappoint, and I was pleasantly surprised with how it is capable of reaching all audiences, not just domestic ones. The fact that Kobayashi questions the human condition and how people of all origins sometimes handle power, honor, and cultural traditions, makes ""Harakiri"" and instant classic for anyone who watches it.",Hara-Kiri
187,aurbz,Very good with a twist,9,11 February 2014,"Harakiri is one of my favorite films since I have seen it. The directing has a very elegant feel and in some parts it feels as if you were actually there. This is one of those films that slowly and unexpectedly unfolds as you watch it. I found myself switching my feelings about certain characters as the movie went on. In the beginning, you are kind of forced to feel a certain way but gradually after that, you start to learn and understand what is actually happening. In each scene you learn something new and after each scene you just want to keep watching more and more. At the end of the film you can't help to think about the way some people live and the extreme moral codes they live by. Not only that but how some things are kept unsaid just to retain some type of order within that culture. Things like that happen all the time. People cover up the truth and flaws so that the code can remain the same and that others will still follow it. You can only imagine the amount of information that hasn't been passed on throughout the centuries due to that kind of reasoning. Overall, I loved this movie and it kept me on my toes throughout. After you think you start to know the story better, you are fed more and more information which keeps the film interesting from start to finish. Definitely a must see!",Hara-Kiri
188,coster_james_michael,Harakiri eloquently portrays the struggle between morality and politics,10,13 February 2014,"Harakiri is an astounding achievement as its influence can be seen in countless replications of its signature plot structure. The characters are slow to develop as their intentions and encounters take place in what feels like real-time over the course of flashbacks. Once their intention is learned, the film erupts with a bloody moral battle over the blindness caused by dogmatism and the corruption of power. What is so unique to Kobayashi's masterpiece is his ability to paint the main conflicting characters with enough humanity wherein you are not able to identify ""the good guy"" until near the ending of the film. Both are viewed in a sympathetic light with their own reasons for their actions being displayed as just and reasonable. This film will make you completely reevaluate your conception of samurai films.",Hara-Kiri
189,annemariesnow,Watch this Fascinating and Moving Story Unfold,8,12 February 2014,"It is fascinating to watch the narrative unfold in this Japanese period drama set during a time of relative peace when Samurai were not actively employed as warriors and so many were disenfranchised ""ronin"" seeking to eke out a living and a meaningful existence.Beautifully shot in black and white and masterfully showing Japanese restraint in its pacing, the film examines the Samurai Bushido (honor) code. But, as a proud ronin named Hanshiro recounts (often through flashbacks) his moving personal story to the Samurai of the House of Iyi, the story unfolds in unexpected ways and we get an opportunity to stare into the souls of those proud Samurai. We also get the opportunity to asses where true honor lies. Is it honorable to adhere to the expected rules and rituals, or is it more honorable to reassess the rules as times of change and to let go of rigidity to show compassion to fellow humans in need?",Hara-Kiri
190,baichunhou,Correct the Wrongdoing by Acknowledging It First,9,12 February 2014,"Rectitude, courage, benevolence, respect, honesty, honor, and loyalty are the seven virtues of Bushido, the spirit that Japanese people value the most. What the counselor of the clan, Saito, did at the end of the movie clearly violates the samurai code because he tells his people to lie about what really happens under the roof of Li Clan. I can't help relating Saito's action to today's Japan's. According to the news, the Prime Minister of Japan, Shinzo Abe, just visited Yasukuni Shrine where 14 of these Japanese Class-A war criminals are paid respects as heroes. In fact, Japanese Government has never admitted that it invaded China and other Asian countries during World War II. Also the government denies the fact that Japanese soldiers committed massacre in Nanking where about 300,000 people were brutally killed. What is the most terrifying and hurting thing is that that period of history is completely altered in some textbooks in Japan saying that Japan was fighting back because other parts of Asia was invading Japan. Personally speaking, I admire the culture of Samurai. And I have always considered the spirit presented by those honorable warriors symbolizes Japan and Yamato people. At the same time, I also believe in humanity. I don't think that any human-made rules can surpass the deep kindness endowed in every individual's heart, which is completely beyond nationality as well as ethnicity. If I ever had a chance to talk to Saito in the movie, I would say: ""Please correct the wrongdoing by first acknowledging it.""",Hara-Kiri
191,orazarnegar,Rewriting history to glorify the victors,9,12 February 2014,"This movie elegantly portrays how history is written by the victors. Kobayashi's soul and personality shine through in his depiction of his experience in the war. Kobayashi flips our emotions so thoroughly and effortlessly throughout the film.He starts and ends the movie with the same scene of a coat of armor, but our emotions and feelings toward the coat of armor couldn't be any more opposite. The way we view the armor in the beginning of the movie as opposed to the end is a great reflection on how we feel about the entire Iyi clan and almost a backwards parallel to how we feel about Motome as the story progresses. At the beginning of the movie we see the armor and it seems to have a life of its own. It's incredibly imposing and you feel as if it is magical or almost godlike and you're just watch, waiting for it to come to life or to see that there's actually someone inside. Though the movie ends with the same exact shot, because of all you have learned about the Iyi can, their symbol seems as hollow as they do. The armor just feels empty, lifeless, and fake. You take the armor for what it really is, a covering or a cloak with nothing behind it. It's interesting how our emotions travel in the opposite direction with regards to Motome. Prior to receiving Hanshiro's story, the audience feels the same way towards Motome and draws the same conclusions about him that the Iyi clan does. However, as Hanshiro's story continues, we slowly realize Motome's motivations for going to the clan. He may have initially had ulterior motives but we end up deeming his actions as justified and the actions of the Iyi clan dogmatic, ruthless, and unnecessary. We stop agreeing with the Iyi clan when we realize that Motome was just trying to provide for his sick son and wife. When Hanshiro points out all the hypocrisy and faults the clan has, Saito looks affected, but ultimately doesn't apologize or change his actions. Kobayashi's pacifistic personality shines through when we see that Hanshiro only took the top knots and not the lives of the samurais that orchestrated his godson's death. While this movie has been taken as an offence to some, I believe that Kobayashi showed what a true samurai was in his characterization of Hanshiro. This film didn't highlight",Hara-Kiri
192,sofia-ehrich1995,A question in the Samurai culture,8,11 February 2014,"The film Harakiri directed by Masaki Kobayashi pulls at your emotions and your stomach. The beginning of the film can be a bit confusing if you don't pay close attention to what is going on. You are lead into a very teeth-clenching moment of watching a man (Motome) perform Harakiri with a bamboo sword in front of his peers. One of the most visually gruesome scenes I have seen in a film. While the scene is very graphic, it serves it's purpose in setting up the film for how meaningful the film is to Japanese, Samurai and just human nature in general. At the start of the film, we don't know much about this man behind the ""disrespectful"" bamboo sword but as the movie goes on, we learn more and more about Motome and the reason behind his flaws in following the strict Bushido Code. The film shows a Renoir-esc way of thinking; every man has his reasons for his choices and every man has a story. According to the Samurai culture, Motome was a disgrace to the name of Samurai and deserved little respect. Little did the Iyi clan know that Motome had good reason for the way he was. Along with the Renoir-esc message, there is a beautiful message of humanism and the problems with extreme power. It is shown how when people are in power, they often abuse it. By the end of the film, you will have a good idea of the Samurai culture, the good parts and the bad, and it makes you think again before quick judging someone.",Hara-Kiri
193,christopher-j-corbally,"'Harakiri' says ""Code is not Humanity""",9,12 February 2014,"'Harakiri' goes from one conflict to the next very effectively. The movie is really a flashback, but shows the series of events that unfolded in a very linear fashion. Great fight scenes in this movie, and it's interesting to know that a lot of the fighting was done live with real weapons. The acting was played out very well with intensity in every character, as if most of their expressions could explain everything that was going on. I believe some of the long shots were a bit unnecessary and made the movie feel prolonged at points, but overall quite a bad-ass film portraying the eventual demise and corruption of Bushido code in the Samurai hierarchy.",Hara-Kiri
194,nicoleyoussef25,Don't be so quick to judge,9,12 February 2014,"This film took me through a journey of emotions. It's amazing what a director shows you or doesn't show you and how each can have a totally different outcome even with the same scene. This manipulation of emotion is used throughout the whole film and is partly why it is so great. The other feature that makes this movie one of a kind is the way Kobayashi is able to take almost a humanistic approach to a movie that could easily be made into good against bad. He does so by making us understand both sides of the equation and leaving the judgment of who's right up to the viewer. The movie kept me surprise at every angle and although it seemed slow and predictable to me at the beginning, my mindset quickly changed after a good 20 minutes into it. Give the film a chance, you'll be surprised at the life lesson that awaits.",Hara-Kiri
195,robkurz35,Awesome movie,9,12 February 2014,"If you're a fan of Japanese culture, and especially if you're into feudal Japanese samurai stuff, than Hara-kiri is a great film for you to watch. It's a Japanese made film from the 60's so don't expect a huge Hollywood type of movie, but even without all of the glamour, it's a very interesting movie filled with symbolism, eastern philosophy, dogma, and really makes you question culture in general and the codes we live by today.I felt like the way Kobayashi filmed the movie made it very suspenseful. At almost every moment it feels like there is some kind of tension going on, and that includes the dialogue which seemed to be most of the movie. Even with that in mind I feel the way it was filmed made every moment in the movie fun to watch. The actors where pretty good as well, especially the facial expressions in the close up shots and the real life sword fighting.A movie that I personally felt that had some similarities to Hara-kiri but in a more modern version was Rambo. Both Rambo and Hanshirō were soldiers who were dogmatic in their military ideology and fantastic soldiers. When they came back to society when they needed it most, they were treated like washed up dogs because society didn't need them anymore. Even though they were the ones whom the system created in the first place.",Hara-Kiri
196,mmorataya131,My first jidaigeki,9,12 February 2014,"A ""not so revenge"" revenge film, Harakiri follows the story of a scorned samurai looking to right the wrongs that other so called samurais have inflicted on his family. Although i have experienced movies that have been influenced by the jidaigeki genre, never have I been exposed to one that was fully immersed into the world of samurais. Harakiri, from start to finish, had me at the edge of my seat. It was a guessing game at first, jumping to conclusions over what Motome's true intentions were and even applauding the Iyi Clan for ""punishing"" the imposter. That is until Hanshiro begins to tell his story... Kobayashi delivers his message loud and clear in such a subtle but powerful way that you are left thinking not only about the consequences of such dogmatic obsessions but also leaves you thinking about the master artistry that he and the actors devoted into the making of this film.",Hara-Kiri
197,hernandeznavi275,Honor that once was,10,13 February 2014,"Harakiri a film that hit me in all the right places always kept me at the edge of my seat wanting to find out what will happen next. As the protagonist Hanshiro requests to preform Harakiri at the Iyi clan house the story begins to unfold. From flashbacks to jumping to the present where things where beginning to finally piece together and tension was growing. This film managed to keep surprising me all the time as the story progressed through the film.The samurai warriors lived by a serious code that by no means should ever be taken lightly or ignored.Honor something Masaki Kobayashi gave great focus to in the film . Portrayed greatly with the the image of the suit of red armor . The images of the suit resembled fierceness, pride, and much honor that could be traced back to its ancestors who wore it.Kobayashi revolved around honor in his film giving me the chance to also question it . Distinctivley showing Hanshiro a true samurai who truly lived by honor something the Lyi clan was clearly lacking . The final scene of the film was what greatly spoke to me in which Hanshiro destroyed the grand red armor . This to me was the symbol for honor itself specifically in the Iyi clan . As when the Red armor went down and broke so did honor itself . When counselor Saito covered up the devastation and dishonor that was made in the Iyi house.I felt the armor lost its meaning, its definition of honor it had been shamed. Honor is something one cannot see but something one believes in almost like religion. This was something Kobayashi was able to actually portray with once again showing the image of the grand red armor .After it's downfall which to me just showed that from that point on the Iyi clan and those who believed in them were believing in a lie full of dishonor.",Hara-Kiri
198,carrie-finklea,Review of Hara-Kiri,10,13 February 2014,"Hara-Kiri Directed by Masaki Kobayashi A courageous story about an unemployed samurai fighting for the honor of his son-in-law, daughter and grandson. The way the story unfolds keeps the audience in a constant state of gripping suspense. The story is weaved together from present-time to flashbacks that slowly (making it all the more suspenseful) reveal the true reason as to why Hanshiro wants to commit Hara-Kiri before the Lyi Clan.In this film, I especially loved the cinematography. As the camera silently glides through the grounds of the Lyi Clan, I felt as though I was a samurai. From the stealth-like camera movement, to the very clean and groomed framing of the actors and the background, to the quiet moments spent waiting for the Hon. Elder to respond to Hanshiro's declaration that, ""he is free to choose a second"" I felt as though I was a member of the Lyi Clan waiting for Hon. Elder to make his decision.I think Kobayashi's story of the samurai culture is extremely relatable to many issues we find in today's society. I found many parallels between Kobayashi's depiction of the samurai culture and religious institutions. For my purposes here, I will use Catholicism as an example. However, Catholicism/Christianity is far from the only religion one could find parallels.In Hara-kiri, the rigid samurai culture adheres to a strict code - the boshido code. However, the way these codes are appropriated leads to abuse of power and corruption. Kobayashi relays this message by focusing on one needle in the haystack - our protagonist Hanshiro. Through his experience, we understand the consequences of these appropriations on a personal level. We see how the samurai culture was full of exclusivity and allowed for their own people to live in poverty and starve to death in exchange for the preservation of their codes. Motome, Hanshiro's son-in-law, was forced to perform Hara-Kiri using a bamboo sword. He pleaded for a few more days before he committed suicide, but they would not listen. The event becomes even more tragic as we discover that the sword was bamboo because he sold the original to save his ailing wife and child.So how does all of this relate to Catholicism? Similar to the samurai culture's strict principles and ideals, Catholicism has a dogmatic, literal and archaic view point on homosexuality and abortion. The Catholic religion bans gay marriage and refuses to acknowledge, support, or accept homosexual relationships within the church. Recently, NPR did a report about a man who applied for a job in a Catholic school. He met all of the credentials, and they were so pleased with his interview he was hired. However, when he filled out his paperwork, he revealed his husband as a significant other. He was quickly informed he no longer could be employed, because they did not condone gay marriage. And what was the position he applied for, you ask? He applied to be a cook! This story is littered with hypocrisy, judgment, exclusivity, and discrimination. In their determination to preserve these archaic beliefs, they have exemplified hate. Or the fact that Catholic gay couples are having to worship in a separate church. What the church fails to realize is that in order to preserve their doctrine's literal meaning, they are violating the core values that are the foundation of their religion.In the end of Hara-Kiri, Saito tells a member of the Lyi Clan the story of what will end up in their history books. He does not want his Clan shamed by the incidents that have just happened. Ultimately, despite honesty being the core value of the boshido code and samurai culture, Saito breaks it to preserve the reputation and power of the Lyi Clan.This is very similar to the current scandals we see today in the Catholic religion. A multitude of sexual molestation cases of young boys by their Catholic priests have occurred. What makes the incidents even worse is the churches knowledge of the scandal and its attempts to cover it up (transferring the priest, bribery,denial). And just like Saito, they too violate one of the core values of their institution - truth.I went to a museum exhibit in which there were letters encased in glass from young women writing to their local government and religious institutions. They were pleading for a way out. These women were trapped with an unwanted pregnancy and stranded without any options. I remember one woman's tearful letter as she begged for her governor to grant her permission to have an abortion. If her school found out she was pregnant, she would be kicked out of nursing school. She was the first in her family to go to school and her father would disown her if he found out.Again, another example of how religion has violated their ethical code in order to preserve the sanctity of their institution. Instead of helping these women and looking beyond the text, they left them stranded and forced them to follow through with their unfortunate predicament alone. This is exactly what happened to Motome when he went to the Lyi Clan to plead for money for his dying family.",Hara-Kiri
199,bot-celine,Harakiri,8,13 February 2014,"The way Masaki Kobayashi filmed this movie was unlike anything I've ever seen. At the beginning we are introduced to a young samurai who is now a ronin, Tsugumo Hanshirō, who comes to the house of the Iyi Clan asking permission to perform Harakiri on his property. The clan becomes very angry when they discuss whether they should let him or not, knowing that many ronin have gone to many clans asking to perform harakiri, with no intentions of doing so, but instead getting sent away with some money. Believing that young Hanshirō had no intention of harakiri, and just wanted money, they granted him his wish to preform the sacred act on their land. Now you can see how distraught Tsugumo looks, and we almost feel happy. They caught him in his shameful act, now making him commit suicide seems almost justifiable instead of downright cruel. Tsugumo begs them for just a day or two, he swears he'll come back but now the samurais are set on teaching this disgraceful samurai a lesson and won't let him leave, even when they discover his swords are wooden. It's shocking, but you feel the need to side with the Iyi Clan, believing what they did is justifiable. Then, as the story goes on, we come to realize Tsugumo came there as a last resort, looking for any way to save his dying wife and dying child. He sold his swords, an ultimate form of disgrace in this culture, to help feed them and take care of them. He would do anything for them, even risk his life and his honor. Showing us that even though samurais live and die by the Bushido code, there are things that take precedence over that, like family and love. This film is a great example of that, and was directed beautifully.",Hara-Kiri
200,addington_ronald_kel,perfection,10,13 February 2014,"I cannot stress how perfect this film is. From the style, the deft direction, to the moral yet humanistic storyline, this is as perfect as a film can get. Harakiri, in one word, is a masterpiece of cinema.We are told a tale of set in post-Tokugawa Japan, where samurai are, for the most par, ronin (without a master), and who are struggling to find meaning and employment when their way of life is upended and their services are no longer needed. These are men who are facing a new world, and most importantly, trying to maintain their dignity in the face of such change. The story starts as the protagonist, Hanshiro, enters the Iyi house to request a place to commit seppuku – the traditional samurai suicide/self-sacrifice. He is greeted by Saito, the counselor, who wants to ensure that Hanshiro is fully aware of his choice and that he is committed to fulfilling his stated desire, as there have been a number of samurai without homes and employment who were simply looking for a hand-out or pity, and therefore, new lives within the Iyi house. After telling of a recent event involving Motome, we are set up for a revealing, unexpected and devastating middle and final act. Without revealing the remaining story, what I will focus on is how the beauty of this film is achieved through the simple yet engaging story. This is a film about samurai, but more so it is a film about how dogma and rigidity is destructive once people choose the status quo and institutional boundaries over humanity and compassion. We are asked to question when and why certain beliefs should give way to mercy, and how a lack of mercy turns such honorable views and institutions into harsh and hypocritical systems that lack understanding and self- reflection/introspection. Like all great films, the story goes beyond what is portrayed and is an indictment of human institutions and societal guidelines. You aren't left simply questioning the actions of the samurai, but rather questioning one's own morals and value systems.",Hara-Kiri
201,Azra666,Thought Provoking Samurai Awesomeness,9,16 February 2014,"The year is 1630. The Tokugawa are ruling and have brought with them a time of peace and tranquility. However,this new peaceful society came at the expense of the Samurai Class, the warrior sect in Japan. As it was a time of peace, violence and battles were hardly a matter of importance and this resulted in the unemployment of the Samurai Class. The Ronin were struggling to make end meet as their feudal lords either went broke or abandoned them.Hara Kiri directed by the great Masaki Kobayashi portrays the story of Ronin Hanshiro and his son-in-law Motome. Told in a complex chronological order, as the movie switches between narrators and flashbacks, the movie shines light on the set of codes that the samurai live by, the Bushido Codes. It forces the audience to take a side on the ethics, or lack thereof depending on your stand on the matter, of the Bushido Codes. Kobayashi did a brilliant job portraying the protagonist, Hanshiro as sensitive and well,a heartbroken samurai who decides to perform Seppuku (the act of a samurai stabbing himself with his own sword driving said sword across and upward his torso) in the yard of the Iyi Clan. As revolting as this may sound, dying in this manner was seen as honorable and a privilege. He utilized Hanshiro's emotional weakness and his warrior strength to question the ethics of the Bushido code in a elegant manner. Hanshiro's uses his anger as a carefully honed weapon to avenge his family and I didn't even see it coming. The plot was taut with suspense and curiosity until Kobayashi introduces Counselor Saito, the head of the Iyi Clan. Character development is evident in each and every character in the movie and contributes to the theme in the movie: the corruption of the authority. Power.Greed. The misinterpretation of honor. The misinterpretation of the Bushido Codes. The story of Motome and Hanshiro is told in a way that forces the audience to change their perspective. In a way, the audience, is also going through character development,as our opinions of the characters change drastically at various stages in the movie.What we may have assumed may tell more about us than the characters. That's what I loved most about the movie, how we are able to make judgments without a moment pause, how it may not even make sense or follow any logic, but we still make assumptions about someone and their life.This was a great samurai movie, not your usual martial arts extravaganza, though the Boss Fight at the end was glorious in its close-ups and dramatic performance. Honestly, it's quite hard to forget, as the characters leave a mark on you and the theme will leave you questioning history and what makes true honor.",Hara-Kiri
202,jjul100,Crazy? or Pioneer,9,18 June 2014,"""Seppuku"" is the movie which makes you think where you are at in the society. And makes you to look back to remind what you have been missing for your own ""Bushido code"".Bushido code is still predominant in this movie's background. Which made that era very hard and painful. When I saw Hanshiro still had sword while Motome sold his sword for his family, I was very disappointed on the other hand I kind of understand what was going on. Hanshiro is a man who would have sold his sword for his grandson's life. I mean who wouldn't do that. But thinking of selling his sword just did not crossed his mind. Because ""Bushido code"" was rooted in everyone's mind. And that really made me think about what I have been missing and questioning things that I have never been questioned before.",Hara-Kiri

209,theloniou5,all-time masterpiece,10,21 April 2011,"I want to make mine the words of another reviewer:""There are good, very good, and even great movies. But among them there are just a few that go beyond great. They belong to the league of their own. Masaki Kobayashi's ""Harakiri"" aka ""Seppuku"" is one of them. The film of rare power and humanism, of highest artistic achievements, profoundly moving, tragic like the best Shakespeare's plays, universal and timeless even if it takes place in the faraway country of 1630 [...] A Masterpiece, one of the best movies ever made, ""Harakiri"" deserves all its praise"" I think that Harakiri is one of the greatest pieces of drama ever written (the reference to Shakespeare is very appropriate). The drama unfolds slowly but with incredible force and ever-increasing tension. But besides involving us in the tragic fate of the characters, Kobayashi denounces the hypocrisy and corruption behind the so often idealized ""honor"" of the Samurai. And in doing so, he also reflects on modern-day Japan's society, where appearance is what matters, and cover-up is the solution to all the problems. In a similar vein, see also ""Rebellion"" aka ""Samurai Rebellion"" (1967), another great movie by Kobayashi.As a frequent reader of IMDb, I see lots of good movies rated with 10 stars. I would reserve that rating to just a handful of movies that are above even the great movies. Harakiri is one of them.",Hara-Kiri
210,manchesteruk,Masterpiece of Chambara.,10,4 March 2005,"This was the first film by Kobayashi that I had the great pleasure of watching. It is methodically paced, and creeps up on you, like the Mifune character does to the lordly samurai in the film. So expertly crafted it defies my trying to capsulize it. The beauty of Kobayashi's work is the basis in reality, his stories and characters are breathing portraits. The bad guys are not acting out of evil, but just working through their interpretation of honor. The good guys are not so perfect, they lie, cheat and set traps. The plot is almost Western in it's structure, a very easy film to follow, but a film that makes you feel educated and cultured. I was completely floored by the opening scene of ""Hara-Kiri."" It is still perhaps one of the three or four most influential pieces of cinema I have experienced. Remaining shocking for me, to this day. The fight in the windswept fields of grass is spectacular. Watch Samurai Rebellion, Kwaiden, and the Human Condition Series. Why Kobayashi isn't more written about I don't know. When I first saw this film I wrote a letter to the director, c/o the Japanese Directors Guild, it was returned months later, saying I had missed his passing away by three months. I highly recommend this picture.",Hara-Kiri
211,sung_joon_h,Grass_Hemmet_Nancy@SMC.EDU,10,10 February 2014,"It was fantastic fighting skill samurai and painful what Motome Chijiiwa kill himself with wooden stick.I've been waiting a long time to watch this movie, but now I've finally seen it! This movie is different from other samurai movies, because it criticizes the samurai code; Bushido, and doesn't romanticize it. Seppuku I don't know if this is the best samurai project ever brought to screen, but I'm willing to bet that it is right up there. Actually billed as an anti-samurai film, this bare-bones black & white drama cuts to the core of the samurai way of life in an examination of the validity of the samurai code. Although the code ultimately stands up to close scrutiny, albeit unsteadily, it is finally only through revisionist manipulation that it does hold up at all. In short, the way of the samurai, or bushido, finally just survives this anti-samurai treatment, teetering upon a shaky foundation made up of lies perpetrated through sheer force of authoritarian pronouncement and will. This not only demonstrates how the myth and mystique of bushido survive, but it also gives good insight into the way those in power can turn fact into accepted self-serving fiction. As an aside, while watching Harakiri, Eastwood's High Plains Drifter, an American anti-western that performs a similar function of undercutting the perceived code, the collective bravado, of the gun-slinging West, kept coming to mind. That's another one I must watch again.",Hara-Kiri

The story keeps getting better and better. The more Hanshiro tells his story kept me anticipated and curious for what would happen next. The bushito code that those samurai lived by made me understand more of Japanese culture and how important it is for them to respect those rules. Each characters, especially Saito, whose position was critical, have there own complexity and duty to fulfill. As for Motome, i was moved by his honorable sacrifice for his family which was the best one can do. This film is truly a classic.",Hara-Kiri

However it is the haunting plot of a samurai explaining the meaningless and worthless flawed belief of the samurai spirit which grips the viewer.Tatsuya Nakadais mighty performance in Harakiri further proves for me, that he is without a doubt one of best actors in the history of film.

216,FRANK13,This is the best character study & Samurai movie ever made.,10,12 May 1999,"I have seen this movie numerous times (at least 10, probably many more), and enjoy it each time.  The first couple of times I saw it was right after it came out.  It did not have sub-titles, and as my Japanese is not very good, I made some assumptions about the characters, relationships, the plot,etc. When I saw it with sub-titles, I was surprised at how few incorrect assumptions I had made.  That I made so few errors is no credit to me, but rather to how well the plot, character development, character relationships, and the overall movie were done.The movie is not limited to feudal Japan, for it transcends this era.  It has lessons, for those who look for this in art.  For instance, just one example occurs to me now:  It underscores the need for a person to stand on principle, and to maintain their honor, ethics, and dignity, even when those who are the political leaders have long since lost theirs.  However for purely entertainment value, the realism, suspense, art, and action could not be better. Words fail to express how this film captivates and entertains. Few films can equal this one.

But on the contrary, they choose Iyi (Ii on modern Japanese) clan. Probably the less questionable clan that ever existed. They show the clan's crest pretty cleanly, and not only that. They go too far to show the very red armor of Iyi Naomasa! Incredible!! Ii Naomasa was an ally of Tokugawa Ieyasu and his men were among the very few allowed to wear a red armor. He took an important role in many battles with Ieyasu, included the battle of Sekigahara. And, after his death in 1602, his clan took part successfully in both Osaka campaigns (1614-15). His loyal support to the Tokugawa led them to be a powerful clan.The film makers date all the drama in the times where samurai did still remember how to wear an armor.Very good film!",Hara-Kiri

Before he does, he tells his story, shown to us in flashbacks. It slowly becomes clear that he didn't select this great lord's house at random.It almost doesn't matter if you are a fan of the genre.

223,HydroX7,Reality as a metaphor,10,2 September 2021,"Just like the sharp edges of shadows on a cloudless summer day, Harakiri is a beautiful play of surprising contrasts that will unravel, slowly, towards a realistic depiction of the frail human condition, while emphasizing the complete lack of honor in an apparently honorable society. The relaxing atmosphere created from early in the film, defined by the calm weather, smooth camera movements, and pleasant static shots will soon be overshadowed by inner tensions and profound feelings, creating a well-defined contrast that won't dissipate for almost the entire duration of the plot.Harakiri dives into the implications of sudden political landscape change. A change that profoundly affects its characters and more specifically the Samurai class. After endless conflicts, a widespread peace has established in the country. The Edo period has begun some 30 years ago and many samurais had become masterless. Without a master to serve they become Ronins, wanderers, struggling to persevere in a world they are not prepared for. While adapting to a new lifestyle, their moral code is slowly being exposed, shown for what it truly is.Self-deceiving and ignorant, the few samurais that still have a master, walk on a rigid and intricate political maze, distorting everlasting truths and morals for self-benefit and for appearances. Living in an age without any conflict or war, they struggle to sustain their image through questionable ethics, ignoring obvious truths or even worse, being completely blind to them.Trying to be true to himself, the main character is forced by the surroundings to progress, mature and eventually accept reality. He descends, resolute and decisive to bring forth an incredible catharsis by revealing with crystal clarity that the ""Thing, we all call samurai honor is ultimately a facade"", bringing ultimate judgement and showing how idealistic and relative honor can be.The word ""Honor"" is used 17 times within this movie, but not even once did it represent its true meaning.Everything unfolds supported by gorgeous aesthetic visuals fusing with an exceptionally well told story, complex characters and music that amplifies the tension to perfection. Japanese architecture never lacked in beauty, surprising with its minimalism, straight sharp lines and symmetry. Being well aware of this, Masaki Kobayashi made sure that every shot was perfectly composed and every element used to its full extent.Harakiri tells a story whose motifs have a deeply instilled permanence that will never become redundant as long as politics and pride continue to exist.

227,doraemon20101224,"Great movie,Harakiri !!!! >w<",9,24 January 2013,"As a big fan in Japanese culture, I think that Harakiri is a great movie. It clearly shows how the Bushido, the way of samurai, works in the ancient Japan. Besides, the architecture and the clothing in the movie vividly give us an image of ancient Japan. The most important is that the movie let us know about the contradiction between the obligation of a samurai and the humanity. Before I saw this movie, I only knew that harakiri was a kind of suicide for the samurais to show their faith and I thought that it is more like a documentary talking about the harakiri. However, it was completely different as I thought. The main story took place in Edo period. At the beginning, Hanshiro Tsugumo, a ronin went to House of Iyi in order to commit harakiri. Then the movie basically told two stories. The main one is about Hanshiro Tsugumo, and the other one is about his son-in-law, Motome Chijiiwa. Both two stories told us about the bad situation of the ronins at that time period, and their reasons to commit harakiri. Movie ended with Hanshiro fighting against House of Iyi and then committing harakiri. The movie showed us how these ronins make their decisions with the contradictory between Bushido, the obligation of the samurai and the various aspects of humanity. For example, Motome sold his sword, which represented the soul of a samurai, in order to get some money for his family. When his son, Kingo got sick and there was no more money to get him a doctor, Motome, as a father decided to commit harakiri. Motome, he made the decision to abandon his obligation of a samurai in order to be a good husband, a good father and a good son-in-law. Harakiri is an excellent movie. It not only tells people stories about harakiri in Japanese culture, but also shows us how cruel and hard it is to choose the right obligation.",Hara-Kiri
228,vincenttorchia,Review of Harakiri,8,21 January 2013,"The movie Harakiri I felt was a great movie that showed great courage and the true art of ancient Japanese traditions. This movie was all about the samurai and its traditions in being a true warrior. Japan was in turmoil at the time and no one had any money and the honor of a true samurai was tested. Many committed harakiri which means suicide because they had nothing left and they wanted to die as an honorable samurai. Motome a character in the film who was a samurai, asked to commit harakiri but for the wrong reasons according to the samurai tradition. Hanshiro Tsugumo the main character and another samurai of this film also asks to commit harakiri but turns in to something more than that. I was a bit disappointed during the movie because I read reviews of this movie that said it was action packed but rally there was really only two fight scenes in the whole movie. Most of the movie was Hanshiro talking to the counselor of the house of IYE. For people who don't like movies with long talking scenes I wouldn't recommend this for you. This movie also had some very bloody scenes that I felt disturbing. If bloody scenes are something you don't like than I wouldn't recommend it. Overall I liked the movie because it had a great story line and I got some background on some ancient Japanese traditions related to the samurai. The movie is in black and white and also in Japanese but don't let that shy you away from it because I think you could really gain a new perspective on films if you watch this movie.By: Vincent Torchia",Hara-Kiri
229,giovonnibrooks,Deeper Than The Sword,8,21 January 2013,"Harakiri was a movie that my class watched as we were involved with Japanese literature. To be honest, I was expecting a nonstop action film; however, the movie was so much more than that. Harakiri used a genre of samurai honor to show Japanese politics and culture. The plot is about a samurai named Hanshiro Tsugumo begging to commit Harakiri (ritual suicide) in the house of Lord Iyi. There, he learns the House of Iyi's story of the fate of his son-in-law, Motome Chijiiwa a previous samurai who sought work or money through lies at the house of Iyi but was instead tragically forced to commit Harakiri with a bamboo sword after they realized his plan. As the movie progresses Hanshiro Tsugumo tells the tragic story of his son-in-law, and how he was forced to sell his real sword to support his sick wife and child. Tsugumo then seeks to send a clear message to the House of Iyi and to get revenge against the house. The plot perfectly fits in with the message of movie. The message within the movie is a huge and important one. The movie shows us the importance of honor in Japanese honor and shows us that suicide is honorable, which is completely different in our culture. The movie is perfectly delivered in its purpose of being created. The framework is remarkable and each frame allows the audience to narrow down on the characters and really get to know them. This movie was way better than I had anticipated.",Hara-Kiri
230,joeconti17,Harakiri,10,27 January 2013,"The idea of watching ""Harakiri"" appealed to me and when going through the process of watching this movie I experienced a roller coaster effect onto my emotions on how I felt about watching the movie and actually what the movie was about. When I heard about watching a movie in class I was very happy because every student loves hearing that they get to watch a movie. This is simply because you get to get away from a classroom environment and just relax and watch a movie. So going into the movie I was very enthusiastic about going to class to watch a movie for three days. When I sat in my seat and the movie starts you begin to feel a little aggravated. I began to feel aggravated because the movie was in black and white; also the movie was spoken in Japanese so I had to read the subtitle the whole movie. Once I got over that I began to actually ""read"" the text that portrayed in front of me. There was multiple times during the movie it gets a little slow but then picks up very quickly which makes this movie very likable. The emotion I felt after watching this movie was one I have never felt before. It was a feeling that was indescribable; it made you think about what you would do if you were in the situation of Hanshiro and Motome. These two samurai are victims of the artistic element that the author or director of this text was trying to portray. The idea was one of obligations in conflict. This is where a character is put into a situation where any choice he or she makes will still put him in some sort of predicament. My teacher said to the class before the movie started that, ""this will be the movie you will watch in one calendar year."" He in fact was right and I do agree it is the best movie that I have watched in a year.",Hara-Kiri
231,Deonteholden10,Harakiri reflection,7,28 January 2013,"I watched the movie and to me its very hard to describe why the people in movie of Harakiri do the things they do but I still find it very interesting. I feel like I would not do anything as far as committing suicide. Watching the movie in the beginning seemed confusing because it started off with a flashback Motome had, he was a person that previously wanted to die by Harakiri. Looking at the series of flashback, I began to learn a lot about him. Watching this movie made me see how painful things could have been if I were in their situation especially having to kill myself with a bamboo sword which is very difficult because the sword was basically plastic. Reason for this is because around this time some Samurais were poor and some didn't have masters so they sold their goods for money. As for Hanshiro Tsugumo, he sold his sword then replaced it with a bamboo sword and I learned that ""The sword is the soul of the Samurai"". This movie helped me appreciate my life as well as the traditions of ancient Japan. I think the best way to actually understand this story is by watching the movie itself. In my opinion I think reading the story would be far too difficult to understand. I think this is a great movie to watch because it gives some information about what happens in noble traditions of ancient Japan.",Hara-Kiri
232,el98020,A samurai movie which is not really a samurai movie,9,21 January 2005,"What a movie! I watched it knowing nothing but its title, and I think this was good for me. There is no point writing anything about the plot, actually two reviews (including IMDb's one) I read afterward reveal too much of it. I think the director would like to create a progressive change to the viewer's attitude concerning ""honor"" and ""moral"". Being Black&White and almost theatrical, it leads you to think rather than watch enchanted by the picture. It is not really a samurai action film, neither a film like ""Hero"" or ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" (both of which I liked so much, for different reasons), although some scenes have common elements. I know not everybody will like it, it is a bit slow and also cruel but it has a point for both. The picture was a little blur at times, but I don't know if it was the film's or the cinema's fault. Anyway, it's a 42-year-old film, so that's better than we can expect!During the intermission,I was wondering which century I live in, so much was I incorporated in the atmosphere! PS. Do Japanese people really talk with their mouth almost closed?",Hara-Kiri
233,lannpiphone,Major goof,8,18 September 2013,"When Hanshiro Tsugumo first arrived at the feudal lord's clan requesting Hara Kiri, no one knew who he was. Yet, when the lord's samurais returned the body of Motome Chijiiwa to his house, Hanshiro Tsugumo was clearly there with his daughter for all to see. This is a major goof in an otherwise excellent movie. The director should have arranged so he would not be at home at that moment. I rate it 6/10 because of this. The Criterion version is exquisite and the black and white close ups are of excellent quality. Samurais are known to have beyond reproach code of ethics, but this movie is telling you otherwise... The inhuman treatment of Motome, the back room manipulation to deal with Hanshiro Tsugumo is proof that feudal politics is as bad as politics of all ages.",Hara-Kiri
234,pinkyphang8,Everything has a meaning,10,13 February 2014,"This movie is complex yet firm methods of honor, strenght, weakness, and family, and western influence with a hidden agenda. Each character had a story of the era of no war and the wages of the soldiers has stopped due to peaceable times and the progress of technology and no use for the samurai. It shows the heartfelt of one household heading towards low class. Remarkably shows how the Ronin seeked out its counselor for assistant but due to its code of honor first introduced to submit harakiri. The camera shots were well in placed, the art of styles and costumes, the meaning of cutting the hair, the sword losing its glory, the architectural view of the living quarters were well shown in this movie. The plot kept me very attentive as to how the ending will be. Yes it delivered what its intent that is to make the viewer be on the same accord as the film director.",Hara-Kiri
235,kasrahmadi,great movie,8,12 February 2014,"in my opinion this movie was really good. This movie affected me in many ways, one way is that now i have a feel for what the samurais were going through in that era, life was really tough for them. it also effected me in an emotional way because a lot of parts of the movie made me emotional as i felt bad for motome , his wife and hanshiro going through what they went and the outcome of the movie. i felt really bad for hanshiro because everything went wrong for him after her daughter got married and it was bad news from there. this movie also showed me the dedication of a samurai to his family when motome took one for his family to change their life for the better.",Hara-Kiri
236,georgiasteff,A masterpiece!,10,29 March 2015,"One of the best movies ever made ,''Harkiri'', tells the sad story of a man who wants to commit Harakiri to take revenge from the samurais that made his son-in-law also commit Harakiri.The movie is not actually about sword-fightings but it's about the meaning of life,family and pride. Although a long movie, ''Harakiri'', keeps you in interest because of the good climax of the story and the flashbacks. Kobayashi proves us that he is a ''Cinema- Master'' and makes us sink deep in the story.Tatsuya Nakadai gives an Oscar- worthy performance playing the main character of the film. Also the film has a great cinematography and music by Toru Takemitsu. It's a wonderful masterpiece that will make you appreciate Japanese cinema !",Hara-Kiri

239,champwiley,One of my first Japanese beauties.,9,17 September 2018,"To tell the truth I'm kind of stretching at the 9 because ""Seven Samurais"" has to be at least worth 2 more. The story is spell binding and hooked me completely to feudal Japan and the Samurai way. The smugness exhibited by the Samurai toward the Ronin had you hating on them from the beginning. I absolutely loved it and thank god I found it on YouTube before they deleted it. It's great!",Hara-Kiri
240,rnahhas,A movie that's very interesting with a fantastic story but it didn't blow me away,8,26 August 2021,As said in the headline I enjoyed this movie. I have no complaints it was very good. But it wasn't a masterpiece in any way. I would probably never watch this movie again but I still enjoyed the way the samurai tradition was displayed here . The acting was pretty good and the dialogue was fantastic. The emotional scenes could of been a little stronger but they were still fine. The pacing may not be for every body but I personally was okay with it. Its a good movie and I recommend if your interested in Japanese movies or samurai movies this is a must watch.,Hara-Kiri
