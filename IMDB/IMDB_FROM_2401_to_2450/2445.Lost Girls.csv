0,SnoopyStyle,unsatisfying ending,7,6 April 2020,"It's 2010. Mari Gilbert (Amy Ryan) is a struggling single mom in Ellenville, New York. Her youngest Sarra has issues. Her oldest Shannan goes missing. She takes her daughters, Sarra and Sherre (Thomasin McKenzie), to Long Island where Shannan was last seen. Police detective Dean Bostick (Dean Winters) dismisses her due to Shannan being a prostitute. Then a police dog stumbles upon the bodies of four dead prostitutes. Police commissioner Richard Dormer (Gabriel Byrne) takes over the investigation. Mari grows frustrated and decides to take on the entire closed-off community.I hate to do this to a true story movie but it doesn't have a satisfying ending. As it stands, I need a re-enactment of that night and Shannan's final moments. I need to know who 'they' are. I need a lot of things that is missing in the real life story. I can't blame the movie for not showing things that are unknown in real life. I can blame it for not knowing the best ending of this movie. The best ending must be Mari's murder by her daughter Sarra. This is not Shannan's movie. This is Mari's movie and Amy Ryan's great performance proves it time and again. She electrifies this movie. She is the heart and soul of this movie. This is Mari's movie and it ends when she ends.",Lost Girls
1,claudio_carvalho,Based on a True Story,7,5 May 2020,"""Lost Girls"" is a dramatic thriller released by Netflix and based on Robert Kolker's book ""Lost Girls: An Unsolved American Mystery."" The plot is engaging and based on the effort of Mari Gilbert, performed by the excellent Amy Ryan, in finding the truth about the fate of her missing daughter. The film shows the incompetence of the Suffolk police and how the victims, usually prostitutes, are considered expendable by the authorities. The serial-killer has not been found and his identity is unknown. The fate of the Gilbert family disclosed in the end is tragic. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Lost Girls - Os Crimes de Long Island"" (""Lost Girls - The Crimes of Long Island"")",Lost Girls

4,ferguson-6,mama's on a mission,6,24 March 2020,"Greetings again from the darkness. The Long Island serial killer is a famous unsolved case, yet very few filmmakers would take on a true murder mystery that has no ending. Liz Garbus long ago established herself as an expert documentarian, and has earned Oscar nominations (WHAT HAPPENED, MISS SIMONE? 2015; THE FARM: ANGOLA, USA 1998). My guess is she was initially attracted to this story as a documentary, but transitioned to her first narrative feature out of necessity. Working from the book by Robert Kolker and a screenplay from Michael Werwie (EXTREMELY WICKED, SHOCKINGLY EVIL AND VILE, 2019), Ms. Garbus and her talented cast offer up a different viewpoint of the crimes ... the viewpoint of a mother who refuses to give up her daughter a second time.Amy Ryan (Oscar nominated for GONE BABY GONE, 2007) gives a fierce and compelling performance as Mari Gilbert. Mari is a struggling single mom holding down two jobs - one as a construction worker, and one in a local diner. She is raising two daughters: Sherri (rising star Thomasin McKenzie, JOJO RABBIT, 2019) and Sarra (Oona Laurence, THE BEGUILED, 2017). Mari takes a phone call from her eldest daughter Shannan, expressing delight that the girl will visit for dinner, and with little hesitation, asks her daughter for some money to fill the gap left by reduced work hours.Shannan never shows up, and a mysterious phone call the next morning sends Mari and her daughters into investigative mode. Daughter Sherri uncovers the secrets her mom has been keeping from her, while at the same time watching her mom tear into the cops for their apparent lack of interest in finding Shannan. Dean Winters (""Mayhem"" from the insurance commercials) plays Detective Bostick, who barely hides his contempt for Mari and her missing 'prostitute' daughter. Police Commissioner Dormer (Gabriel Byrne) deals directly with Mari, and bears the brunt of her aggressive fight to keep her daughter's case from fading.Mari is wrestling with her own emotions regarding Shannan, and it's really daughter Sherri (Ms. McKenzie) who becomes the most interesting character in the saga. Other key players are Kevin Corrigan as conspiracy theorist Joe Salise, Reed Birney as creepy Dr. Peter Hackett, and Lola Kirke (daughter of Bad Company drummer Simon Kirke, and GONE GIRL) as Kim, the sister of one of the missing sex workers. With Mari pushing the cops, four bodies are discovered near a wealthy gated community called Oak Beach. There is a tremendous sequence involving 911 calls, and it plays right into the debate of whether this was incompetent police work or a cover-up. The lack of interest regarding missing girls seems to make it clear that the cops were hardly motivated to find the sex workers, and when Mari reminds them that these are daughters and sisters, it's a powerful moment.Director Garbus includes some actual news clips, and at the film's conclusion we see a 2016 press conference with the real Mari Gilbert. Shannan disappeared in 2010, and 10-16 bodies have since been attributed to the Long Island serial killer - though the cases have never been solved. As a police procedural, the film has far too many gaps and skims over details and evidence. However, as a personal drama and commentary on police attitudes, it succeeds.
The film is now available on Netflix.",Lost Girls
5,blanbrn,Tender emotional heartfelt raw painful journey a truth seeker for justice and closure!,8,17 March 2020,"""Lost Girls"" is a well done film based on Robert Kolker's best seller and it chronicles and focuses on the Long Island serial killer case and murders of the mid 2000's. The spotlight of this picture is from the viewpoint of one of the victims mother's that being Mari Gilbert(in a strong and gritty performance from Amy Ryan) who's daughter Shannan goes missing after working as an escort. This leads to an upscale gated well to do area of beaches and suburbs on Long Island, and for the matter the discovery of other young women who've been missing as their bodies are all of a sudden discovered in a cluster. Problems are from the start as the police don't seem to take it serious as they even think that Shannan's death was an accident! Still with more bodies discovered and finding out that each victim was an online sex worker the theory of one serial killer is the perceived norm. The film really unites the victims and their families as they all try to ensue that their daughters, sisters and even mothers have not been forgotten. As this film is one of courage and will as it is a battle for respect and it fights for answers and seeks justice. As the questions linger was it a police cover up? Was the well to do Gilgo Beach community hiding their own dirty little secrets and was the actual killer right around like that of a john or strange doctor?! Overall well done actual real life crime thrilling mystery that seeks answers and gives tribute to the long lost girls.",Lost Girls
6,Edvis-1997,6,6,17 April 2020,"Well the beginning was very nice and involving but then it became bland and something like cheap copy of masterpiece - ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"". The fact that ""Lost girls"" film based on some parts of true events supposed to be emotional but the problem was that characters didn't show it. It was lack of emotions.",Lost Girls
7,ThomasDrufke,"Tough To Get Through, But Worth It",8,31 March 2020,"For whatever reason, I really gravitate towards true-crime style film adaptations even when they are extremely dark, like Lost Girls. That style of filmmaking has always appealed to me and I'm not exactly sure when it started. Lost Girls is an engrossing but at times very brutal take on the Long Island Serial Killer, who has still not been convicted to this day, and the lives he/she forever changed as a result of the killings. Amy Ryan, who I have adored since seeing her performance in Gone Baby Gone all those years ago, plays a mother to one of the victims and someone who brought a significant amount of national attention to these crimes & the victims, while the media focused on the occupation of the girls involved. It took me more than one sitting to get through this & that was due to the subject matter and not the quality of the film, which is quite good. Perhaps this isn't the time in the world to see such a devastating story play out on your television, but it's captivating for sure.8.0/10",Lost Girls
8,cruise01,Dull crime drama that leaves it unresolved.,4,21 March 2020,"Lost Girls (2 out of 5 stars).Lost Girls is a dull crime drama film about Mari (Amy Ryan) after her oldest daughter goes missing. The police investigation stalls and goes nowhere. She goes on a search for her. While late investigations discovers bodies of prostitutes that went missing long ago and the urgency to find them was forgotten by the police.The plot is frustrating and saddening. Especially with sex trafficking and girls going missing. The detectives and police urgency on investigating takes forever. Until they only find bodies. This being a true story is even saddening. The films plot is dull. The direction is slow and boring. The acting is wooden with Amy Ryan and the rest of the cast ensemble. The plot goes nowhere with Mari going on searching. While police does nothing. Besides focusing on Mari nonstop searching for her daughter.Overall, Lost Girls is a bad film. The story is flat. The direction, acting, and script is wooden and tedious.",Lost Girls
9,pmtelefon,"An annoying, unsatisfying watch",2,18 April 2020,"""Lost Girls"" is a mostly brutal watch. It doesn't deal with any police investigation. It just deals with the antics of a very annoying woman. Amy Ryan gives an annoying performance playing a rather unsympathetic character. I lost interest in what was going on almost immediately. Ryan is annoying before she even realizes her daughter is missing. So when she starts getting involved with the investigation, I didn't care. The subject matter deserves a better treatment than ""Lost Girls"" delivers.",Lost Girls

11,jtindahouse,A clearly passionate retelling of a woman's fight for answers and justice,7,13 March 2020,"I stumbled upon 'Lost Girls' tonight on Netflix and thought it looked interesting so decided to give it a look. I wasn't aware of the story behind it and I wasn't aware that it was based on true events. The main thing you'll notice when watching this movie is that is has an agenda, and it pushes it very heavily - and I liked that because it was personal. When a film just picks an agenda and decides to shove it in your face, that's garbage. But that isn't what happened here. This movie has a reason to be anti-police based on the real-life happenings and it wants people to know that. I think it found a good balance between getting its point across and also making sure it didn't consume the movie.If you asked people to list all the Oscar nominated actresses who appeared in 'The Office' I think a lot would forget to put Amy Ryan on their list. She is though and 'Lost Girls' is further proof that when she is given the material to work with she can act her backside off. Her performance means a lot to this movie because she is the driving force behind almost every scene. If she wasn't able to pull it off the movie would fail, simple as that. She is terrific.If you don't know anything about the real-life events this is based on then this film works very well as a mystery-drama. If you do know about them then I would suggest you're still going to enjoy this film, just in a different way. Don't come in expecting action scenes and over-the-top drama thrown in for the sake of it. This is a low-key, understated film that just goes about its business and does so wonderfully well. I had a great time with this movie and I suggest you will too.",Lost Girls

With the help from her other daughters, she will stop at nothing to find her missing daughter.Amy Ryan is great, gives a descent performance has a flawed but good mother, who goes on searching for her daughter, despite the laziness from the police, who show little to no remorse for her. Gabriel Byrne starts out like that, has detective Richard Dorimer, but has the movie goes on he does kind of redeem himself. It's a real sad story about love, loss, and regret. I really wish the girls will get there justice.",Lost Girls
13,alindsay-al,An Above Average film based on true events,6,13 March 2020,"With the Coronavirus leading to more and more films being delayed, it seems like streaming services such as Netflix will be the main source of watching new films and TV series. The new Netflix film Lost Girls came out today and I have had a chance to watch it and this is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a girl get kidnapped, after the police botch the investigation her mother leads the charge to get justice for her daughter and others like her.
Main Character
Amy Ryan plays the main character in this film and she does a really good job in the film, her character has so much pain and you follow her through this journey as she tries to get answers about what happened to her daughter. Her character has some issues about her and she isn't the most likeable person in the world but you totally understand where she is coming from and you see just how difficult it is for her character to go through the tough circumstances.
Supporting Characters
Thomasin Mckenzie from Jojo Rabbit is in this film and she does a good job in her role, she is one of the other daughters in the film and it is interesting seeing the way that she deals with the dissappearance compared to her mother. Gabriel Byrne plays the policeman in charge of the case and his character goes through quite a bit in the film, he clearly wants to do things by the book but understands where Ryan's character is coming from. He questions everything in the film and it allows his character to develop throughout and be more interesting then your average policeman. Though I felt all the other characters weren't that interesting and felt that they weren't as powerful as these other characters and some even felt a bit cliche and unrealistic for a film based on true events.
Story
The story is pretty tough to watch, as you clearly see a one woman mission to try and get answers, you go with her on the journey and you want to see her get answers in this film. However, I felt the pay off wasn't there in the movie, I know this film is based on true events so you can't change the ending but that means maybe it wasn't a story that should have been adapted. Also on another note, this film spoils its plot in the first minute and it took me out of the film and the ending.Script
The script has some really good dramatic dialogue, the biggest compliment I can give to it, is that it feels very real, it doesn't feel like something somebody wrote on a piece of paper. But I felt like the script didn't delve enough into certain aspects of the film and it leaves you wondering if there were certain aspects of the script that were cut out of the film.Style
The style of the film is very methodical in its pacing, it keeps you intrigued in what exactly is going to happen if you don't know the story and it made you support the protagonist in its quest. However, it is pretty slow, and I questioned what was the film trying to achieve and as mentioned the film either accidentally or on purpose basically gives away the ending in the first part of the film.Overall
Overall this film has an important story from real life and the film itself is interesting to a certain extent but overall I just thought it was okay and there wasn't anything that stood out. If you are interested in seeing a real story with a good lead performance then this will be a decent watch but you don't need to rush to watch it.",Lost Girls
14,kwenchow,"Another worst film! Full of boring conversation, and overuse scene! Bored to freaking death!",1,21 March 2020,"This film start with a woman ""Mari"" shouting at her colleague, she smoking, and talking with her two daughters scene! As turnout, this film is about solving the mystery of the disappearance of Mari's daughter(Shannan)! Shannan has bipolar since young, and grown up as a prostitute! Entire film full of boring conversation! Not a single kidnap, and violence scene show to the audience! What kind of film is this? Pathetic! The overuse of the singing video footage of Shannan in the film, also make the film unwatchable! Only intensity of the film is the profanity! At the end, the police found the corpse of Shannan!

15,sauravjoshi85,Slow screenplay spoils the show,5,27 July 2021,"Lost Girls is a mystery drama film directed by Liz Garbus and stars Amy Ryan, Thomasin McKenzie, Lola Kirke, Oona Laurence, Reed Birney and Gabriel Byrne.The movie is based on the murder mystery of serial killings committed by the Long Island serial killer who was never identified.The movie is based on an actual story but the script of the movie doesn't do justice with the original story. The movie is backed by some good performances but very slow screenplay spoils the show.Acting is good and Amy Ryan did a tremendous job however at the beginning of the movie she irritates but catches upon as the movie progresses. Gabriel Byrne was decent in the role of commissioner. Rest all the cast was decent.The screenplay of the movie is slow and can play the spoilsport for the movie as the movie can't grip the viewers for long, also the screenplay of the movie is also uneven, the emotional scenes are also ineffective and couldn't connect with the viewers.Overall a decent movie which could've been good with some fast and gripping screenplay.

16,Pairic,Intriguing Mystery,7,14 March 2020,Lost Girls: Based on the Long Island serial killings. The story centres around Mari Gilbert (Amy Ryan) mother of missing Sex Worker Shannan. Mari's relentless campaign forced the police chief (Gabriel Byrne) to conduct a search for her daughter and to seek the serial killer(s) responsible for killing up to 16 women. Best acting plaudits though go to Thomasin McKenzie as Sheree Gilbert. Reed Birney is suitably creepy as a suspect. Terrible incompetence and dereliction of duty by the police is revealed. Directed by Liz Garbus. 7/10. On Netflix.,Lost Girls

The book was a tough read, and the film is no different. Strong cast, and a film that can't provide any real closure for the viewer. Netflix should make more films based on true crime stories. Lost Girls is a sad story and more focus is not a bad thing.",Lost Girls
24,maccas-56367,"Rest in peace, girls",8,27 March 2020,"A really passionate performance by Amy Ryan kept me engaged throughout this film. In the lead role of Mari Gilbert, she came across authentic and convincing as a distraught mother seeking justice and answers for her daughter.Lost Girls is far from perfect and has many flaws. It makes up for this in its respectful approach to the true unsolved crimes. Too often these type of films exploit tragedies and show a lack of respect. This wasn't the case here. Viewers feel Amy Ryan (and those portraying other victims' families) fighting passionately for these girls every step of the way. In focusing on the victims' families and the victims themselves, the film felt refreshing.It's quite procedural but I thought director Liz Garbus did well to condense such a huge case into a 90 minute runtime. Stylistically, it gave me Zodiac vibes. Gabriel Byrne also delivered a solid, yet understated and performance in the role of Commissioner Richard Dormer.If you like true crime, then Lost Girls is worth a look. It has certainly made me want to read the Robert Kolker book it's based on and research more into the Long Island Serial Killer.Rest in peace to all the girls. I hope you get the justice you so very much deserve. My thoughts are with all your families and friends.",Lost Girls
25,nathanmanson,So so sad,7,25 September 2021,"For this to be real it's genuinely so sad. It brought a tear to my eye numerous times through out. The police are an absolute joke, why didn't they search that area to begin with. I know why, it's because she was a sex worker. If it was a lawyer or something else like that, they would've definitely searched every area on day one. It's literally so sad man. Amy Ryan always produces great performances in thrillers and he's another one. It confuses me how you could give this a low rating because I've seen quite a few and i don't get it at all. I was already sad off the film in general then you find out Mari dyed in real life, it got to me I can't lie. I really do hope the killer is found some day. I'm not saying Hacket did it but it's so suspicious he'd lie about calling Mari. Was an enjoyable and emotional rollercoaster of a film, I'd highly recommend it if you love real life crime thrillers.",Lost Girls

29,Just-A-Girl-14,DEPRESSING - AS ONLY REAL LIFE CAN BE!,8,8 August 2020,"The movie is well made. I see no reason for the low ratings. With that said, it's really depressing - as only real life can be. It is based on the true story of a mother looking for her missing daughter who disappeared while working as a sex worker.
The movie shows the ugly sides of our dysfunctional society (wrecked homes, mental illnesses, awful police work etc).
Here is what you need to know before watching it: this is not a story with a happy ending! The Long Island serial killer was never caught. It's not a crime show. It's a dark drama that is based on true events. In my opinion, it's worth a watch just be aware of what it is. As mentioned in the beginning of the film, it's ""an unsolved American mystery"" and it's the reality of a very sad and common situation (serial killer or not).",Lost Girls

32,WalkdenEntertainment,Touching Story with Heartfelt Moments,6,31 March 2020,"Mari Gilbert is a mother of three daughters. Her oldest no longer lives at home and generally keeps in contact with her mother from time to time. After a recent call from Mari's oldest daughter, Mari is expecting to have her over for dinner and catch up. However, on the night of the daughter's planned visit, she never shows up. After not hearing from her eldest daughter for a couple of days, Mari begins to investigate the matter further and questions the police surrounding the possible disappearance. Mari soon discovers that her daughter isn't the only girl that has gone missing in the area. Could they all be connected? And most importantly, is her daughter still alive?For those who are not aware, Lost Girls is based on the Long Island Serial Killings which is now also a published book. While the film at time feels like a thriller, I will say in advance that if you're expecting a blockbuster ending with many twists and turns, this is not that type of film. Lost Girls is a slow burn drama and we see it all from the eyes of a mother doing everything to seek out the truth about what happened to her daughter. This is a mother who is seeking answers and demanding the assistance of the police. Lost Girls is a true crime story and I feel it's an important story for the world to see and I'm personally glad that I did.The film does a fantastic job at drawing you into the disappearance of Mari's daughter. As Mari begins to question police procedures and the events that took place around her daughter's disappearance, you'll find it easy to support Mari's decisions, even when at times she crosses the line with her use of foul language or force.The leading performances here are stunning, particularly from Amy Ryan (plays Mari). Supporting actor Gabriel Byrne also gives a surprising performance but I must confess that I've always had a soft spot this actor. Actors who are side characters also give good performances, but they simply don't have enough screen time nor are their characters really standouts in the film. Side characters other than Mari's own children seem to be brushed off and used more for the background.The visuals of this film are also positive. As a Netflix title, I was rather impressed at the streaming quality of this film. The audio track is also positive, but the film doesn't have any type of soundtrack to compliment the film. If I'm honest, the lack of a soundtrack wasn't a problem for this type of film anyway. One of biggest issue with this film was the unusual editing style. During certain scenes the cuts felt incorrect or sometimes out of place. Characters go somewhere and begin a discussion only to have the scene quickly cut (perhaps to suit a runtime).Overall, Lost Girls delivers a solid combination of drama and mystery. Along with the mixed packet of genres, there also are positive performances from key cast members including Amy Ryan & Gabriel Bryrne. But because the film is based on actual events, its ending is rather obvious and will rarely surprise a viewer. The film also makes unusual cuts which seem to interrupt scenes, making the movie feel slightly awkward and perhaps rushed. Either way, this film is a heartfelt story and no matter what my opinion is, it's a very important film to see for yourself. 6.2/10 - Walkden Entertainment",Lost Girls
33,madhukar30,Lost opportunities? !!,4,26 August 2020,"Lost Girls would have been definitely gripping & interesting for people living around Long Island or a nostalgic reminder for those who followed the incident a while ago. But for people living far away and totally unconnected, the movie doesn't set the screen on fire. I am afraid the perils of not knowing about the incident before hand has robbed ""Lost Girls"" it's due respect.I believe it's the duty of the director to kindle the emotions of the audiences minds and work it in his favour but I am afraid Lis Garbus succeeds to do that only in a very small measure. Screenplay is filled with lot of jargon repeated over time and again to make it totally unimpressive for a 95 minute duration. Cinematography and editing was just about par. Acting levels were not that great either and very unrealistic sans emotions. A seasoned actor like Gabriel Byrne was unbelievably pathetic in the role of a police commissioner.As another reviewer pointed out before me, Lost girls would have been an excellent & interesting documentary. As a full length feature and that too a thriller it falters big time and does nothing apart from adding another dud to the growing list of Netflix debacles. All I can offer is 4 stars and my sympathies to the families of the lost ones. Watch it only if have nothing else to watch.",Lost Girls

Young girls labelled as drug addicts and prostitutes, murdered with impunity. sadly the film did not do them justice. no one explained what went on in the gated community, we could only guess. no one was brought to justice and some girls were never found. the male detectives were not interested, it wasnt their daughter so it wasnt their problem. great acting from the lead females. not so good acting from Gabriel. almost as though he couldnt really be bothered.",Lost Girls
36,rohit_vit2020,"Just a real story, can't bank much on the script",5,22 June 2020,"It is a real story, that don't take any deviations to en-thrill you. If you consider this as a movie, you would not enjoy it, as the murderer is never found. It is not a mystery/thriller material much. And it is better that such kind of stories that has no proper conclusion should abstain from becoming a movie material. Giving 5/10 as I feel sorry for the lost girls, otherwise i could have lowered my ratings further.",Lost Girls

38,royhectorkabanlit,A Pretty Good Thriller,8,18 March 2020,"It's pretty good, with a strong performance from Amy Ryan as a headstrong mother looking for her lost daughter. Pacing and Character Development was good, it's one of those movies where the storytelling flows easily. Great job by Director Liz Garbus.",Lost Girls
39,Guanche48,Very good and realistic movie!!,8,14 April 2020,"Don't understand the low rating!!! This is a really good movie with grrreeeattt acting. Wasn't specting such a good crime story line.Tense,sad,happy,exciting and good written story!!",Lost Girls
40,Paynebyname,Interesting for what it doesn't say,5,22 April 2020,"This film was interesting though it was hard to care about many of the players when so many are so unsympathetic.Amy Ryan plays an older version of the same character that she played in Gone Baby Gone and you can't help but think that if Casey Affleck's character from that film wanted to know how Amanda's life would turn out, this is how it would.This film although showing Ryan's character as having some warts seems happy to lay a lot of the blame at the feet of the inept and corrupt police force. Indeed you really feel that there is an agenda at play here.However, if you do some research into the actual people from the film the main woman has someone serious flaws in her character and judgement.Does this mean her daughter needed to die, of course not. Does this mean police mistakes or errors should not be detailed - of course not. But there does seem to be an attempt to gloss over some rather pertinent details in the case that whilst making the film more dramatic do signify a desire to promote a message rather than tell the truth.Performances were good all round and Amy Ryan seems to have nailed down (in two films now) the archetypal mother that you would never ever want for any child.",Lost Girls
41,paul_3-960-896774,A lot of unsaid yet it's deafening,8,25 March 2020,"@garcwrites :I'm not sure I can spoil the movie but I'll keep it simple enough so that if someone like me, with know prior knowledge of this story can experience this film fresh.The song performed by that haunting voice at the opening credits of the film as images of a scared young woman running in a dark country are showed puts you in the right mood for this movie.It was striking to me how, in the beginning of this film, when the little sister - Sarra - is first seen, we cannot see her face. It's a shot of her back, then a few seconds before we see her face, it's a shot of her mother driving looking back at her while she's lying down in the backseat of the car. That shot is reminiscent of both a parent looking lovingly at a sleeping child in the back seat of a car, or that of a kidnapper longingly looking at a victim.There's a lot to unpack in the first 20min alone. From what Mari and her girls' life is like, their struggle, family dynamic and past. To the dismissals, and downplaying of legit worrisome events, or the slow change of the narrative within the story: Shannan goes in the span of 5 minutes to a missing grown woman who probably just left, to an implied drug addict and/or dealer, to full on prostitute.I like how Mari, the mother, is in no way portrayed as a saintly woman to ""ramp up"" her sympathy factor. She's a woman who does what she can to make ends meet but clearly is not an attentive mother to the two other daughters she still has at home, almost seeming negligent with them. Shanon appears to be her favorite - before she's ever missing - and the other two know it as well.
There are subtle things to be picked up in this movie, like a photograph in the Oak Creek home owners' association building, or the way the dispearance of Shanon gets even more dismissed, ignored, or downplayed as more information is discovered about her character.I was starting to worry that there wasn't a single decent man or police officer portrayed in this movie, they all seemed inconvenienced and annoyed by Shannan's disappearance. But then Joe showed up out of nowhere, then another took action. Yet I don't feel like man are vilified.Lost Girls is a harrowing thought provoking true crime story ideal for an investigative podcast - that probably already exists. It needs to stay in the public's consciousness but mostly needs truth. It is well very well written, masterfully directed with grounded performances.",Lost Girls
42,MongoLloyd,"Mediocre thriller, beautifully photographed.",3,14 March 2020,"I'm not sure if the subject matter just doesn't allow for a more compelling film story or if the writer/director team just couldn't craft a compelling film story. I was hopeful after the story got moving that Amy Ryan would be ripping asses left and right, but it sort of fizzles out about half way through. Maybe the lesson here is that not all stories make good films?",Lost Girls
43,PaxtonMalloy,A true crime story that is not about the crime,8,4 January 2021,"If you are expecting a thriller then you are going to be disappointed. This may have thrilling moments and a murder mystery but this first and foremast is a drama and a very good one at that. This is a conscious decision from a director to tell you about the victims and the family of the victims. About denial, sorrow and anger all beautifully portrayed buy an absolutely outstanding performance of Amy Ryan. It is about time she get's a part like that to show that she is a brilliant actress. Gabriel Byrne is good too but his part is so small and we will here a lot in the future about Thomasin McKenzie who plays the older daughter. A sad story that will get you with Ryan's performance, the beautifully melancholy score and some very nice camera work.",Lost Girls
44,cappiethadog,She has a name,7,18 May 2020,"""What do you want to call her, a lawyer,"" Mari Gilbert(Amy Ryan) tells her middle daughter, when Sherre(Thomasin McKenzie) takes issue with how the media refers to big sis, Shannen(Sarah Wisser), who she affectionately calls ""diva"" as a prostitute. Soon after, the mother comes around to Sherre's objection to how news outlets sensationalize the disappearance of a young woman. Does it matter; your profession, even if it's the oldest profession? ""Lost Girls"", directed by Liz Garbus, adapted from the true crime novel ""Lost Girls: An Unsolved American Mystery"" by Robert Kolker, reminds all of us about the hierarchies involving not only race, but gender, too, and the sub-hierarchy within that gender which runs the gamut from lawyer at one end of the spectrum and ""hooker"" at the other. Background noise, that's all it was; white noise from ""The Today Show"", as the news of Shannen Gilbert's disappearance broke while people were having breakfast in America. Garbus, an award-winning documentary filmmaker best-known for ""The Farm: Angola, U.S.A."" and ""Ghosts of Abu Ghraib"", is also a semiotician, which serves the Brown University grad well in ""Lost Girls"", her debut feature film. A semiotician would know what the piano in ""The Piano"" would mean.""Disarticulation"" is how Detective Malloy(Mark Ruffalo) describes the serial killer's methodology to Frannie Avery(Meg Ryan), an English teacher, in Jane Campion's ""art house"" police procedural ""In the Cut"", the much-maligned 2003 film adapted from the Susanna Moore novel. In layman's terms, he cuts up a woman's body into pieces. Frannie, a word collector, recognizes the analog from her lexicon; she would say that this psychopath deconstructs his victims. And because of the film's red light milieu, the killer deconstructs the exotic dancer/prostitute into shards of eye candy. To reach her half-sister's room upstairs, the NYU professor walks past strippers in various states of undressing because Pauline(Jennifer Jason Leigh) lives in a gentleman's club. Campion, a semiotician, perhaps, second only to Todd Haynes, uses the camera to cut women's figures up, showing the female anatomy in pieces, mimicking the perpetrator. The all-male clientele fetishize body parts, not the body itself, the filmmaker and her director of photography suggests, and certainly, not the soul inside. Disarticulate can also mean ""break up and disrupt the logic of"". Like ""In the Cut"", Garbus, too feminizes the male narrative; the crime drama, with its predilection for talk over action.Mari goes to visit Dr. Peter Hackett(Reed Birney), the man who called about Shannen during the first twenty-four hours of her disappearance, but first she gets Barbara(Mary Bacon), his receptionist. What's with the scissors? What's with the dogs?Frannie is the last person to have seen Angela Sands(Heather Liteer) alive. Of all the bars she could have chosen to meet up with Cornelius(Sharieff Pugh), a student, the Virginia Woolf scholar picks the Red Crow, where she becomes the protagonist in a genre novel adapted into a genre film. Frannie takes a break from cataloging African-American slang when Cornelius violates the terms in their unspoken contract of platonic congeniality. By happenstance, Frannie stumbles upon Angela in the hallway of a darkly-lit basement while she's working. The English teacher can't see his face; his only distinguishing mark is a three-of-spades tattoo. Frannie is not Nancy Drew. After the prostitute turns up dead, she doesn't enlist Pauline to help solve the case, even though the sex worker's body was excavated from her apartment complex's garden. In film noir, sheets of rain or falling snow meets the genre expectations of its kind. Campion, the semiologist, hides from Frannie the fatalistic end that is inevitable for Pauline by adding a woman's touch to the oncoming danger. The femme fatale is inundated by dead flowers. Pauline, the stalker of a married doctor, is caught in a petal storm. ""I thought it was snow,"" Frannie says. ""In the Cut"", at the time, was roundly criticized for having no momentum. Instead of showing the ongoing investigation, the cat and mouse game between law enforcement and criminal, we see a digression of sorts; two women talking about love and marriage; it's a ""chick flick"" that threatens to subordinate the crime drama. Similarly, Mari Gilbert, in ""Lost Girls"", is given significantly more screen time than Detective Bostick(Dean Winters) and the ongoing investigation, tearing a page right out of the ""In the Cut"" playbook, with its stress on female friendships over male bonding. Mari and her two surviving daughters, Sherrie and Sarah(Oona Lawrence), meet the other victims' loved ones, sisters and mothers left behind; the dirty work of a L*** ******-based serial killer(a.k.a. The C******** ******) at a diner where they talk like sad steel magnolias. Narrative-wise, it's a static and a decidedly feminine anti-plot point, this outpouring of collective anguish, compared to watching law enforcement in action: Commissioner Richard Dormer(Gabriel Byrne), overseeing his men collect evidence, trying to anticipate the killer's next move; a fluid and masculine storyline that ""Lost Girls"" goes against the grain of. There is a slight difference, though. For Jane Campion, it was a purely aesthetic choice, steeped in narratology, whereas Liz Garbus exposes the police procedural film as pure Hollywood. ""In the Cut"", despite its purposeful inertness, is conventional to formula on this point; the good guys, the police, were actively searching for Angela Sands. ""Lost Girls"", on the other hand, reveals to the audience a terrible truth about law and order. If you're nobody, nobody is looking for you. The lost girls would have stayed lost without outside forces, especially Mari Gilbert, who wasn't mother of the year before Shannen went missing, but is now, willing the police department into action through sheer grit. Commissioner Dormer initially treats the skeletal remains of four Jane Does as an inconvenience. Acting on Mari's tip, with some reluctance, Richard checks out the beachfront shack that belongs to Dr. Hackett, a person of interest who gives off the aura of being an untouchable protected by important and powerful well-connected friends. As head honcho, Richard can give the order to clear all that thick brush on Hackett's property and dig for Shannen. He is The Hardy Boys in aggregate. Why the heck does somebody in the medical profession need so many burlap bags? Richard should call Dr. Hackett in for questioning. But for the time being, he doesn't. Ironically, Mari, a construction worker, knows her way around a scraper. But Nancy Drew needs the proper permits to sleuth around.A motif in ""In the Cut"" is running girls; they're in the background of the filmmaker's mis-en-scene wherever Frannie goes. The girls aren't running from any imminent danger. But one day in the future, ""In the Cut"" posits, they will, probably from a man. ""Lost Girls"" opens with Shannen's last night on earth, running away from a car, headlights catching nothing less than primal fear in her eyes. Just like Frannie, the young woman trusts the wrong man. Michael Pak(James Hiroyaku Liao), the driver, tries in vain to save Mari's oldest. After a bad experience with Joe Brewer(Matthew F. O'Connor), her john, Shannen can no longer differentiate a good man from a bad man. Detective Malloy, in ""In the Cut"", is the good guy. But this filmic world has a binary; fiction/non-fiction, and the English teacher is caught between both worlds, literal and poetic, and in her frazzled state, runs to the bad guy, Detective Richard Rodriguez(Nick Damici), who takes her ""To the Lighthouse"", literally, a red lighthouse where Malloy's partner tries to kill the romantic, who finds poetry in prose. Campion uses soft and deep focus within the frame to show Frannie transitioning from the dream state of her interior life into the bustling and oft-grimy urban landscape that is every New Yorker's exterior reality. In O** *****, where the very rich distance themselves from the riff-raff, Shannen looks for help from a dark house. When the light go on, it's light s out for this ""Beautiful Dreamer"", who once sang the words ""beam on my heart"" as a child in an elementary school talent show; the words of Stephen Foster.Shannen's remains were found on Peter Hackett's property. The commissioner, nearing retirement with nothing to lose, finally called the scraper in. The young woman's body was disarticulated. No charges were brought against the doctor. It's a cold case; the L*** ****** murders, a body count that keeps growing. But ""Lost Girls"" is not without rhetoric, not without a point-of-view. Garbus points fingers, visually. That's what a person trained in semiotics do. As aforementioned, Barbara, the doctor's receptionist, with scissors in hand, cuts, or rather, disarticulates dogs from a sheet full of canines. Mari Gilbert, her two daughters, and family members of the other lost girls, help transform each ""dog"" back into a young woman, an individual with a name and identity other than prostitute.Fido, Lucky, Spot............no.......Shannen Gilbert, daughter and sister.",Lost Girls

So here is a thought: There is likelihood the ego of the Long Island serial killer will read these comments - a story about them,7,4 April 2021,"Based on true events, Lost Girls (2020) touches on the wider story of the Long island serial killer, who, to date has not been identified.As a film it was very good, and anyone with any empathy for others will be drawn into the mothers desperate search to find her daughter.For myself, the most poignant part of the film was the end. The incredibly selfish act of taking someone's life for your own 'pleasure', or self protection, is beyond the lowest of the low, but the domino effect such a cowardly and moronic act has upon that person's family makes it even worse, and this is very much the case for Mari Gilbert (the mother of Shannan).Recommended for those who enjoy films based on true events, true crime and mystery.",Lost Girls

51,Diablo1616,The actual story behind this film is very interesting.,6,20 March 2020,"A strong film about the true story of some of the victims of the ""Long Island serial killer"". Director Garbus refreshingly redirects attention from the potential offender(s) and gruesome acts and shines it instead on the treatment of the victims and their families in the very recent past (2010-11) - the awful concept that those living a ""high risk lifestyle"" don't deserve the same attention/investigation by law enforcement or the public. Ryan delivers an incredibly powerful performance as mother Mari Gilbert, emphatically driving the message that the victims are more than just the crimes and person(s) that ended their lives. An incredibly poignant message finally gaining traction in true crime. Well done to all involved in this. Let's hope this trend continues and leads to real world change that destroys the notion that any one person is ""less dead"" than another and sees cases like these no longer go tragically unnoticed or unsolved.",Lost Girls

I do not mind movies based on true events being as close as possible to the reality they are based on. However, knowing this film is based on an inconclusive case, having a lack of major fictional addition to the plot knowing that the film lacks a clear ending make the film pretty boring and uninteresting. I mean the story is pretty interesting during the first two halves, but having it end the way it does just creates a sour aftertaste that made me question if it was even worth it getting invested on this characters when they are not even developed properly.",Lost Girls
55,gooseshaw,A typically romanticized version of a true crime.,5,19 September 2020,"Lost Girls is a fairly generic 'Hollywoodized' true crime story about a missing girl and her family's efforts to find her. In the movie we have every ingredient that you'd expect from a standard biopic like this: hard working mom who made sacrifices but loves her daughter relentlessly, crooked cop that behaves like a cartoon of a crooked cop, and even a heartwarming, yet grounding former prostitute who helps the family cope with the ordeal.While the subject matter of this film is quite real and raw (as it's based on the real Long Island Serial Killer), the movie is neither of these things. The family and all of its members are whitewashed versions of themselves that lack the true to life characteristics that might finish your sympathies for some of them. The the efforts to which the mother of the missing girl are reportedly played up, while her less desirable characteristics were played down. Even the villain of the film, who's written so cheesily that he'd fit better in a James Bond movie, was selected to be the obvious killer, despite the real crime remaining unsolved.The acting was fine if you ignore the tiring one-note performances, and the movie was generally well constructed I suppose, but the constant narrative pushing diminished my viewing experience. This is a problem I have with most biopics that I watch.I also have to say that I've seen Thomasin McKenzie in a couple of other movies and she generally plays those characters well. In this movie however, I simply couldn't help but be pulled right out of the movie every time she spoke.So, would I recommend this movie? Nah, don't bother. Go watch a documentary instead.",Lost Girls

You know when you keep checking the time that a film isn't gripping you as a viewer and I found myself checking the clock every five minutes.The film is just flat, it's just kind of there if that makes any sense.

The story of a mother searching for her lost daughter where the police failed her: failed her daughter's panicked 911 call, were indifferent to the girl's fate: 'just another hooker'. Ignored calls for a search until a police dog found by accident, three corpses, ultimately leading to 9 more, including that of the missing girl. An appalling story of police neglect and incompetence. The NY Long Island Serial killer was never caught.

60,stairways,Linear and simplistic.,3,16 March 2020,"A 'case' as serious as the one that forms the centrepiece of this story deserves both better storytelling and more empathy with the characters. Instead we get an entirely linear and dull unfolding of events with no real characters to speak of, a kind of Greek chorus of hurting mothers and sisters, not one of which is real or memorable, let alone the loved ones they are mourning or still searching for. As a film this fails on so many grounds. And as a factual documentary (or a 'based on a true story' exposition) it offers no real insight into either victims or perpetrators. The story is better told in a number of recent podcasts. The actors here would be better employed making us care for a character but unfortunately we never get to know anyone well enough, even the torn-apart mother who exists, it would seem, only to express the pain of a loss unbalanced or unexplained by the expression of love",Lost Girls

I assumed it was that type of suspense crime drama after watching the trailer, so I pulled the trigger. It is not over the top entertainment; however, I was working on a project, and it was a good choice for background noise. I would compare this true crime drama to an audit book. You'll be invested, but you do not need popcorn and a blanket.I do not understand the reviews that state the acting is not good or it is horrible. That statement is far from the truth. I believe they all did a good job. The story is basically about a mother who has had a very hard life- made bad life choices, works a lot, raising latchkey kids, etc.- fighting against a system who doesn't put much stock in her missing daughter who is labeled a prostitute. They eventually find her daughter's body, but even to this day argue over if the daughter was actually killed, or if the elements were to blame after she passed out in the marsh. Was she actually the victim of this serial killer in Long Island?No, the movie does not go into detail about the killer. No, you don't get a story about the police tracking down leads of this Long Island murderer. It's simply a mother running all over the place, dragging her other two daughters along, searching for clues and arguing with police and detectives.

Good script, good, sometimes even memorable dialogues, good character developing, good scenery, cinematography, direction... no complains at all.I really enjoyed this film so much that I was hoping that it would last much longer.

The acting was great along with the actors, the filming was great, the writing was great, and I think this film was amazing! A+I cannot believe it was a true story! Its amazing how everyone likes to point the finger at someone else. The mother wasn't perfect, and by the end of the film, she seemed to realize it, and said she would start with herself when it came to responsibility, which means she was finally looking for truth, but its hard to blame a woman that was trying to raise a child while still a child!Its amazing how cops like to degrade prostitutes, but ironically, prostitutes main customers are often cops! What does it say about people when they degrade prostitutes but have no issue have sex with them? It says they are projecting because they are clearly the sick ones because they take advantage of people who are suffering, sick, abused, and need help! Most prostitutes were molested and raped as children and young woman which is statistical fact! I am a clinical psychologist and know first hand how many women that are sex workers were raped or molested by their dad's and males in their family as CHILDREN! These women need help, and clearly the one in the film needed help, because she had a psychiatric disorder and was not right in her head!The fact that the old man who she interviewed said she ran away when he said he called the cops to come help her says the cops were involved in this whole thing! If you noticed, when she walked into the Association center and they focused in on the group pictures of the cops suggests that the film makers, from their researching for the film, believe the coops were behind part of this, and probably used and had fun with these women while they kept them captive and eventually killed them. This was clearly not the work of ONE man but several, and the way the cops handled this, their clear cut desire to move on, the lost evidence and lack of care for obvious evidence, especially during this day and age, because this day and age all law enforcement know that everything is evidence, suggests that these cops helped kill this girl.The reason this girls murderer was never found is because the cops were behind this and it was in a small town where a group of men, and possibly women, worked together to accomplish whatever sick and twisted desires they had! For all we know they could have had a secret society there and they used these sex workers as sex objects, sacrifices to Satan, or some very sick and twisted stuff, which is what the movie ever so subtly suggested!If the cops didn't just brush this off and act like it wasn't a big deal then I wouldn't feel this way. The cops were so adamant about not searching for this girl and clearly did not want to find here suggests that they are complicit. Its one thing to not care so much, and to be lazy, but this is obviously more than that, and the cops CLEARLY did not want to find her!",Lost Girls

79,There-I-Said-it,Such a shame,5,15 March 2020,"Once again a compelling story is severely let down by poor writing and that oh so familiar agenda.Right from the start we are introduced to a pissed off Mari who isn't taken seriously by men. That's pretty much the underlying theme of the story as the writer takes many opportunities to point out, woman=strong, men=bad. The thing is, the woman's story alone IS compelling. She has her flaws but her love for her daughter motivates her to great lengths. We can see this for ourselves without the vocal reminders.The biggest problem however was the lack of character development. None of the characters get properly fleshed out and the gravity of their situation is the only thing drawing you to them. There is also quite a few moments of coincidence to keep the story moving that doesn't seem plausible and is usually a sign of lazy writing.On the plus side, the acting is decent (but not great) while the directing and cinematography are very good. Unfortunately all that talent is wasted on this screenplay.It's by no means a bad movie but I wish modern day writers took as much time to flesh out protagonists, their journey and the world the live in rather than ensuring ample opportunities to slip in some modern day virtue signalling and catch phrases.It seems this tragic story won't get any justice in life or in film.",Lost Girls

90,dilippoddar-IN,Unapologetically Realistic,7,28 August 2020,"The unwavering spirit of a mother to unravel the mystery of her daughter's disappearance in Long Island has been pictured in the most realistic way imaginable in Liz Garbus' Lost Girls. With police who won't cooperate and people who can't be trusted, Mari Gilbert (Amy Ryan) leaves no stone unturned in figuring out the whereabouts of her daughter Shannan (Sarah Wisser).The most moving and heartfelt part is the portrayal of the undying spirit of a mother caring for her children. Despite being single, Mari is supporting three daughters and this deserves incredible respect. The movie shines light on the insecurity and risks that surround not just sex workers but literally every person out there on the streets, especially when law enforcement is either uncooperative or corrupt.A curiosity that can be felt by some viewers is the indifference of Shannan's boyfriend about her being missing for two days, which, even though for the record does raise questions in Mari's mind making her give him a visit, remains a mystery. Another noteworthy idea that has been highlighted in certain scenes is the effect of medication on child health as Sarra (Mari's youngest daughter) can be seen sleeping in odd settings after taking her meds for mental health, which in turn is another worrying subject.The film is sure to leave audience with a lot of questions on what needs to be done so that people are safer.

94,laceydelrae,Movie lacks focus- falls short,4,16 March 2020,"I really wanted to like this movie, but it lacked focus. It tried to be too many things but never coalesced.From the very beginning the movie takes off running and never stops running long enough to give us any emotional depth to these characters, introduce us to the characters, or allow all the side stories to take shape.The movie is about how a working-class woman, Mari, has taken it upon herself to do an investigation of her missing daughter because the cops are either indifferent to her plight or are actively engaging in a cover-up. The movie focuses on the mothers determination and anger the entire time (ignoring everything else) we really have no idea what the cops are up to either way. We don't learn anything about how the department functions, its methods, the way law enforcement tackles (or refuses to tackle) violence against sex workers, and if there was a cover-up, what the police department would have to gain from such effort. This leads to a film where Mari yells obscene things, flying off the handle at anyone (mostly the cops) in her path, then does her own investigating and the cycle repeats. This is how the film goes the entire time. We never learn anything.The movie contradicts itself. At the onset Mari is struggling to make ends meet needing extra shifts, but then she somehow has an endless amount of money and time to investigate 24/7 on her own and ignore her other children and responsibilities.You can tell the movie has a lot of powerful ideas that try to take shape but ultimately the storytelling falls flat.

""Oddly, despite working closely with Mari on Shannan's disappearance, John Ray (Sarra's lawyer) also claimed Sarra's belief that Mari was demonic was partly based in truth.

103,eileen-guthrie555,This movie brings back all the horrors of the Long Island Serial Killer,8,14 March 2020,"I very rarely write a review on IMDB this is my second review, but I felt compelled to write one because of my familiarity with this story as a former Long Island resident and was very familiar with the area where their bodies were discovered. The Long Island Serial Killer (aka LISK) still remains unknown to the Suffolk County police. There have been many suspects over the years. John Bittrolff was one of those accused in these murders. He was arrested, tried and convicted of three of the murders of Rita Tangredi, Colleen McNamee and Sandra Costilla. He is serving two life sentences plus an additional 25 years in Fishkill, NY. DNA that was found on these girl's bodies is what convicted him of these murders.Joseph Brewer was the last person to have seen Shannan Gilbert alive. He hired her as an escort from Craigslist on the night of her disappearance. Brewer said that shortly after Gilbert arrived at his residence, she began acting erratically and fled into the night. Gilbert was reportedly seen running through Oak Beach, pounding on the doors of homes in Brewer's neighborhood. Around this time, Gilbert called 9-1-1 saying that ""they were trying to kill her"". However, police did not find any evidence of wrongdoing, and Brewer was quickly cleared as a suspect.Dr. Peter Hackett was one creepy dude in my opinion, and he lied to the police when he said he never made a phone call twice to Mari Gilbert when phone records showed that he did. Why lie about something like that, that could be easily identified? The marshy area where Shannan Gilbert's remains were found were behind Hackett's house and backyard. Mari Gilbert filed a wrongful death suit against Hackett in November 2012, claiming that he took Gilbert into his home that morning and administered drugs to her, facilitating her death. Later police revealed that Hackett had a history of inserting himself into, or exaggerating his role in, certain major events. Police also noted that Hackett's wife and two children were home on the night of Gilbert's disappearance. Police later ruled out Hackett as a suspect in the deaths of Gilbert and the other LISK victims.Now, one of the more interesting ""suspects"" was James Burke, the former Suffolk County Police Chief claimed he was connected to the Long Island murders. In November 2016, Burke had been sentenced to 46 months in federal prison, along with three years of supervised release, for beating a man who stole a duffel bag filled with sex toys and pornography from his vehicle. Burke had pleaded guilty in February 2016 to charges of a civil rights violation and conspiracy to obstruct justice. Gilbert's attorney said in December that one escort claimed that she had had ""rough sex"" with Burke during an Oak Beach party. Burke was reported to have blocked an FBI probe of the LISK case during his time as police chief. He has never been cleared as a ""suspect.""The media has speculated about a profile of the killer, referred to by police as ""Joe C"" (unknown subject). According to the New York Times, it is most likely a white male in his mid-20s to mid-40s who is very familiar with the South Shore of Long Island and has access to burlap sacks, which he uses to hold the bodies for disposal. He may have a detailed knowledge of law enforcement techniques, and perhaps ties to law enforcement, which have thus far helped him avoid detection.Shannan Gilbert's death was originally ruled as a drowning but due to the controversy about Gilbert's death, in September 2014, famed forensic pathologist Dr. Michael Baden agreed to conduct an independent autopsy of Gilbert's remains in hopes of determining a clear cause of death. Upon examination of Gilbert's remains, Baden found damage to her hyoid bone (the same bone in Jeffrey Epstein's case), suggesting that strangulation may have occurred. Baden also noted that her body was found face-up, which is not common for drowning victims. Despite this, her death is still officially listed by police as an accident.The worse thing about these many deaths and bodies found was the lack of respond from the Suffolk County Police. Fourteen bodies were found and only 6 have been identified and because most of the victim minus the 24-month-old baby girl whose mother was identified as Jane Doe #3, were all prostitutes. Their bodies were dismembered and spread out along the south shore of Long Island because many had identifying marks such as scars from surgeries and tattoos. Because they lived a dangerous lifestyle their murders didn't matter to them and never took it seriously until Mari Gilbert came and made it important. She was unrelenting in her pursuit of justice for Shannan. Sadly, there are no happy endings in the Shannan and Mari Gilbert's stories. Mari was murdered by her youngest daughter Sarra, who suffered from schizophrenia and Shannan's murder remain unsolved.The police didn't care enough to want to solve these brutal murders because they were prostitutes. I've seen enough real murder mysteries to know this is a pattern with most police. If a victim lived a dangerous lifestyle even runaways and were murdered, they probably deserved it and that just infuriates me.This movie brings back all those horrors of the LISK into my mind. It was well acted by all involved but Amy Ryan was outstanding, and her performance brought out the quintessence of the real Mari Gilbert and her pursuit of justice for her oldest daughter Shannan. The actor who played Peter Haskell brought out his creepy vibe perfectly. He made my skin crawl just as the real man did.EXCELLENT movie and I give it 9 out of ten. I would love to see a miniseries on the Long Island Serial Killer in the hopes of families who could identify the remains of the remaining 8 bodies.",Lost Girls

106,Texan_man,A Bleak House of Blame,7,13 July 2020,"Netflix's Lost Girls is the true story of a mother's search for her missing child, and wants to be a clear-eyed and moving expose about the many ways in which troubled young women are let down by parents, police and society at large.Sadly, it's a story we have all heard about, and I hope to goodness none who reads this will ever get to know it well, but it's a part of our human existence that needs to be told.Using Robert Kolker's book as her source, director Liz Garbus recounts a mother's efforts to find her eldest daughter, a prostitute, after she vanished following a house call in a gated Long Island community. At every turn, what our protagonist discovers is a lack of urgency about, if not outright indifference to, her daughter's disappearance, even after other bodies are found in the very same area.There are powerhouse performances in this bleak tale, which has very little in the way of answers, but a lot of blame to pass around.

Gilbert's mother & youngest sister...who was/is so mentally disturbed in real life, she ended up murdering the mother by stabbing her multiple times and is currently in prison &/or hospital.

123,Juliajulie,Just ok- what's up with the accent?,6,30 April 2020,"The show drags out a bit. Characters are difficult to like, but the mom does a good job portraying a desperate mother with baggage. I don't understand the daughter's talking at all. Is it an accent. I hated every scene she was in.Overall, good premise. Just fell short of being good.",Lost Girls
124,mansouralhussain94,Worst movie ever,1,19 March 2020,"It not a good story to make a movie about, there are better serial killers stories.",Lost Girls
125,ChandikaD,True Unsolved Mystery...,6,14 June 2021,"It is a true crime story with lots of unanswered questions. The ending is not predictable as in most of the other movies. However interesting story which is close to most of the real time cases, which is failing to provide a real closure...",Lost Girls
126,arose823,Inaccurate storytelling and unconvincing acting,1,14 March 2020,If you do your research you will find that most of what is portrayed in the movie is simply untrue. The movie tries to make the police look completely uninterested which is not truthful and makes the mother look like the good guy (hint: in real life she's not the good guy). Also the weird and awkward acting made it very hard to be empathic toward any of the characters. Waste of time...,Lost Girls
127,bari_dominguez,Good acting based in the written story,8,4 May 2020,"This movie really keeps energy from the leading actor Amy Ryan who is since the beginning of the event dissatisfied with the disappearance of her daughter.Strange is that knowing how effective is normally the police and the number of victims there are not more agencies looking for the guilty person.
But as in other similar situations the important thing is to keep firm and get the answers.
I recommend watching this movie.",Lost Girls
128,biso-93,true story but waste of time!!,2,21 April 2020,True story but waste of time!! and the story is miss manythings,Lost Girls
129,sharath-1093,Pathetic Acting from all the cast...,2,4 May 2020,This could have been a very well made film talking on issues like mental health and medical expenditure needed for them etc... but the Acting from all cast was just pathetic and Banal without inciting any kinda emotions... More than actors one should blame the director who shot the movie that way...,Lost Girls
130,somajeepx,Really good movie!,10,14 March 2020,Some of the best acting I've seen in awhile. Very moving. They did a really good job with the facts. You'll want to google information when the movie ends.,Lost Girls
131,antonslapnik,real story real people,8,14 March 2020,"Maybe us citisens dont want look them own faces
perfect noir movie",Lost Girls
132,udkum-58637,Movie is a waste of time keeping a lot of queries unsolved,2,16 March 2020,"The movie was related to a true event and that is why it catches attention of people who know about it. But the movie did not end well. The story was not portrayed that nicely. It leaves a lot of questions, like: How long after this incident did the murders continue to happen? Could the police stop the murders in that place? Why only sex workers?",Lost Girls
133,vanessaenglm,This movie is trash!,2,17 March 2020,"I am so disappointed that I wasted my time watching this movie. Even thought it's based on a real event, I expected a lot more.
The acting was just really bad. I waited for the twist in the end but nothing much happened.",Lost Girls
134,adiomanovic,"Good acting, the plot is not bad too",9,31 May 2020,"In the center of film is a mother who is fighting against slow system, after something bad is happened to her family member. A story is a little bit slow, but i think in cases like this, person who is living through it has the same sense that everything is so slow, answers are nowhere to find, the system is slow and person feels to be alone.
Main actress is very good, and the inspectors in the film are good too, all three are known actors.",Lost Girls
135,oli-32959,Time wasting,2,20 March 2021,"Inexplicable dark pictures/scenes. You often can't see just hear the movie. Tipically Netflix: choose not the best person for the movie (here: the director), mandatory to choose a woman.",Lost Girls
136,robchampion,Could have been good,4,20 March 2020,Moody dark lighting makes it almost unwatchable. Story is good but too irritating with most scenes in the dark and blurred backgrounds.,Lost Girls
137,sinemsozeri,I feel sorrow,8,19 December 2020,"Unfortunately no matter where you live in the world, you are only matter to others with what you do for living. I really felt in my bones the suffer the mothers and sisters had. This is a really good filmed true story, I'm sorry it's unsolved case and to think that the killer is still outside makes me feel angry.",Lost Girls
138,rgrawin72,Probably more enjoyable if you have no knowledge of the true story...,5,17 March 2020,"I had been looking forward to this, as the beaches where the bodies were found were in my hometown, by the beaches I frequented, and I have been closely following the case for almost 10 years.I had read the book, which I thought was an excellent depiction of what had taken place. It covered each victim's story, and went into detail about the people of interest, and the odd behaviors of the residents of Oak Beach.This movie, on the other hand, focuses almost entirely on Shannan Gilbert (who police went on to say was not a victim of the Long Island serial killer, although I question that conclusion). The story is so badly skewed to fit the narrative of this hero mom, fighting for answers. In reality, Mari Gilbert was anything but a hero, and although I don't fully agree with the way the police handled the investigation, they spent months looking for Shannan (leading to the discovery of 10 other bodies).I would love to see this story as a documentary, broken up into episodes that can focus more on its complexities.To be honest, I almost find this offensive to the victims. I do think it could be entertaining for those with no knowledge of the actual case, but for those of us who know it, it causes more eyerolls than anything.",Lost Girls

Decent movie.There is nothing more to say.",Lost Girls
140,jayanthkannan,Good storyline - BUT WHY THE F IS THE MOVIE SO DARK,3,14 March 2020,"I'm leaving a 3 only because it's unecessarily dark forcing me to crank up the brightness on my TV, there's no reason to pretend that it's set in Scandinavian winters when it's not.I hate it when filmmakers do this. Other than that the movie is mildly interesting and based on a true storyline.",Lost Girls
141,seabeetodd,Terrible writing and acting,3,18 March 2020,"Good story, but the writing and acting is horrible. Looks like a straight to video movie you used to find in the $1 bin at the dollar store.",Lost Girls
142,amypauliks,"Enjoyable to watch... But not the story of ""Lost Girls""",5,16 March 2020,"This film was enjoyable to watch and I found the acting to be pretty good. If this were a standalone film, I'd give it 7 or 8 stars!That being said, this is nothing like Kolker's book, ""Lost Girls"". I think Mari's story is well worth sharing, but this film was about her and not the victims as the title would indicate. It's laughable that this film shares the namesake with a book that goes to such lengths to honor and humanize the victims. I was actually kind of offended at the conclusion when there was a memorial for Mari Gilbert, but NOTHING to memorialize the missing and murdered women!",Lost Girls
143,fhadcod,Any twist ?!!!,5,19 March 2020,"Ok ok.. it seems that the writing is the main problem here.. good writing is like a base to any movie.. i know this is a real event.. but come on maaan .. I waited for something at the end to shock me .. nothing.. all are expected
The acting was ok in my opinion.. the message that they wanted to deliver.. is delivered !!!
Nothing more .. the problem is in the base .. which is the writing.",Lost Girls
144,gary_t-95232,Where's the beef?,3,21 July 2021,"This movie is about as flat as any I've seen in recent years. The telling of a fact based story of the missing girls is interesting, but the movie just doesn't present it well at all. The characters are all dull, boring, and unlikeable. I didn't find the main characters to be realistic at all and the mother, in particular, is portrayed so one dimensionally that she just appears to be bored throughout the entire movie.It might have made a decent documentary, but as a movie, it falls very flat and is generally uninteresting.",Lost Girls
145,johnfsg,Disappointing,2,13 March 2020,"Looking like it would be an eye opening film to talk about and deal with a very important issue in today's society but instead it became a MEN are crap, COPS are crap and oh yeah white men are crap.Total let down and total sale out to the SJW crowd.",Lost Girls
146,aimeeh-17377,Woud recommend if you are interested in killer documentaries,6,29 March 2020,"Where do I even start ?? I would highly recommend this if you're interested in serial killer documentaries not only is it based on a true story. This movie is not only informative it also helps to humanize sex workers and shows they are human too.
It shows a mother's battle when everyone else is against her . Definitely worth a watch",Lost Girls
147,cjwaelde,Information Included.,9,21 March 2020,A story around a much much bigger mystery. If you like true crime this will hit the spot. The casual watcher may find the story slow but the pay off is the true accountings.,Lost Girls
